'''Ascaron Entertainment''' was a [[video game developer]] based in [[Germany]]. Founded as '''Ascon''' and later renamed in October 1996 due to the possible confusion with the Swiss company [[Ascom (company)|Ascom AG]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamestar.de/specials/reports/1958674/die_akte_ascaron.html#ascaron-heisst-ascon Die Akte Ascaron - Große Hits, große Reinfälle] ''gamestar.de''&lt;/ref&gt; the company produced titles primarily for the PC until it became insolvent in 2009.

==Background and history==
Ascaron had its headquarters in [[Gütersloh]], a town in western Germany. It had a development studio in [[Aachen]] and an international office in [[Birmingham]], in the [[United Kingdom]].

Ascaron had a particular focus on strategy and management games. Among its early successes were the ''[[The Patrician (game)|Patrician]]'' series (a trading simulation) and the ''[[On the Ball (video game)|On the Ball]]'' series (a soccer team management simulation). More recently, the company had developed games such as ''[[Port Royale: Gold, Power and Pirates|Port Royale]]'' (a pirate/trading simulation game), ''[[Sacred (video game)|Sacred]]'' (an [[role playing game|RPG]]) and ''[[Darkstar One]]'' (a space combat simulation).

Ascaron was also known for publishing or distributing many games from smaller developers and publishers. Examples of games distributed by Ascaron in the UK include [[King's Bounty: The Legend]], [[Audiosurf]] and several games in the [[TrackMania]]-series. The company distributed games from other European publishers, such as [[Nobilis]] and [[Focus Home Interactive]].

In April 2009, the company was unable to pay its debts and went into [[Administration (insolvency)|administration]] citing the extended development time of [[Sacred 2: Fallen Angel]] as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58234 Sacred Developer Ascaron Files for Bankruptcy, Currently in Takeover Talks] ''shacknews.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The company continued trading in the hope that a solution could be found, but the company was ultimately dissolved in July 2009, with [[Kalypso Media]] purchasing many of the licenses and assets from Ascaron Entertainment, with the notable exception of the licence for Sacred, which was acquired by [[Koch Media#Deep Silver|Deep Silver (Germany)]]. [[Gaming Minds Studios]] was then launched by Kalypso and former Ascaron employees. 15 former Ascaron developers joined the Gaming Minds Studios.&lt;ref name="gamingmindlaunch-Gamastura"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24095|title=German Developer Gaming Minds Formed|last=Alexander|first=Leigh |date=June 18, 2009|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2010, Ascaron UK was still in operation, acting as a distributor for other publishers. Customers include [[Paradox Interactive]].&lt;ref name="Amazon.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/forum/cd/discussion.html/ref=cm_cd_et_md_pl?ie=UTF8&amp;cdForum=FxAX1RR3W2ACDR&amp;cdMsgNo=6&amp;cdPage=1&amp;asin=B002RL9RKY&amp;cdSort=oldest&amp;cdThread=Tx3P7UM8F6KREX&amp;cdMsgID=Mx3EQ712M47CC69#Mx3EQ712M47CC69|title=Mount &amp; Blade: Warband discussion|date=2010-03-18|last=Swindells|first=Roger|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baj Pomorski Theatre''' is a [[puppet theatre]], located in [[Toruń]] in Poland.

==History==
'''The Baj Pomorski Theatre''' was started thanks to [[Irena Pikiel-Samorewiczowa]]&amp;nbsp;– an [[artist]], [[Painting|painter]], and repatriate from [[Vilnius]] who had come to [[Bydgoszcz]] in April 1945 possessing a document from The Ministry of Arts and Culture (dated April 1, 1945), entitling her to organize the first puppet theatre in Pomerania. It was supposed to be a ''younger brother'' of [[Warsaw's Baj Theater]], hence the name ''Baj Pomorski''. The Bydgoszcz theatre was situated in the city's slaughterhouse, which had functioned as a German marionette theatre during Nazi occupation. On October 28, 1945 it performed its premiere for children&amp;nbsp;– [[Ewa Szelburg-Zarembina]]'s Little Wandering Taylor. The conditions of Bydgoszcz's stage did not, however, meet the needs of the young [[puppet theatre]]. Therefore, I. Pikiel very willingly accepted the proposal for moving the headquarters of Baj Pomorski to Toruń. As early as April 1946 the Theatre had been granted a building at 9 Piernikarska Street, which had previously belonged to the German Castle Theatre during the war. It is in this beautiful location near the ruins of the [[Castle of The Teutonic Knights]] that the Theatre has been performing till today&amp;nbsp;– extending to the past sixty years.

The first actors of ''Baj Pomorski'' were students from [[The University of Nicholas Copernicus]] who, under the guidance of experienced actors and directors, took part in theatrical clinics and thereby unearthed the arcana of puppet animation. Work conditions were not easy. The theatre had humble equipment at its disposal, yet it was actively involved in on-the-road performances not only in Pomerania, but also throughout nearly all over [[Poland]]. By then ''Baj Pomorski'' had already achieved its first success. In 1947, [[Joanna Piekarska]], an artist and director, became the theatre's artistic manager. She directed the performance entitled [[She-Cat's House]] which received 3rd prize at the 1st [[Festival of Russian and Soviet Plays in Warsaw]] in 1950. This achievement, as well as the theatre's extensive activity, contributed to the nationalization of Toruń's puppet stage. At that time this meant that, on one hand, the institution would gain financial stability, while on the other, certain liberties for creativity, so inherent in pioneering activities, would have to cease.

==Directors==
From then on the rules of play planning and selection, mandated within a cultural policy, had to be consistently obeyed.
The following directors of the theatre were 
*Stanisław Stapf (1950–1960),
*Leszek Śmigielski (1960–1972),
*Tadeusz Petrykowski (1972–1979),
*Konrad Szachnowski (1979–1980),
*Antoni Słociński (1980–1988),
*Krzysztof Arciszewski (1988–1992),
*Wojciech Olejnik (1992–1993),
*Czesław Sieńko (1993–2003).
*Zbigniew Lisowski has been ''Baj Pomorski's'' director since August 1, 2003.

==Theatre in 1960–90==
All the directors have left their ineffaceable expressions upon Toruń's puppet stage. It was when [[Stanisław stapf|Stapf]] was the theatre's acting director that the days of ''Baj Pomorski's'' ''artistic adolescence'' occurred. He was the one responsible for helping modernize the theatre, making it into one of the best equipped stages in Poland; he displayed a premiere for adults (the first of its kind for the theatre&amp;nbsp;– a Polish preview puppet show of [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]; he initiated the [[North Poland Puppet Theater Festival]] held in Toruń&amp;nbsp;– Pomerania's first event of this caliber. 

During the Sixties, under [[Leszek Śmigielski|Śmigielski's]] management, a further change was brought about in ''Baj Pomorski's'' image, from that of a traditional puppet stage to one of a theatre seeking new forms of expression, open to Toruń's artistic life. It was during this time that the largest numbers of preview shows within the history of the theatre were staged; ambitious spectacles (influenced by traditional folk theatre) were created, and innovatory stage productions by contemporary regional authors were shown. The [[Club of Creative Circles Azyl]], formed during that time, was a unique artistic phenomenon in Poland, making ''Baj Pomorski'' the center of cultural life and the venue for many a theatrical initiative. 

Thanks to [[Tadeusz Petrykowski]] the theatre reanimated its cooperation with theatre groups abroad, including those from the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Romania]]; it also increased its participation in Polish puppet festivals.

[[Konrad Szachnowski]] made his name in ''Baj's'' past by coming up with a modern concept for staging theatrical classics. His preview puppet show of [[Fernando de Rojas]]’ [[La Celestina|Celestine]] found its place in Polish puppet theatre's historic lore by using an amazingly creative theatrical idea involving supermarionnette and ''trashy theatre''. 

The eight years of [[Antoni Słociński]]'s management resulted in the development of theatrical education programs for children; besides this the theatre began to mark its presence at international festivals, with cooperation with [[Germany|German]] (mainly in [[Göttingen]]&amp;nbsp;– one of Toruń's partner cities) and Czech theatres, growing stronger in the process. 

The following directors&amp;nbsp;– [[Krzysztof Arciszewski (theater director)|Krzysztof Arciszewski]] and [[Wojciech Olejnik]]&amp;nbsp;– presumably continued to expand upon programs based upon previously developed images of the theatre. An important modification introduced during that time was the transformation of the theatre into an institution financed by the City of Toruń.

==Theatre after 1990==

Further development of ''Baj Pomorski'' occurred under the management of [[Czesław Sieńko]]. This was the era democracy being stabilized in Poland, the executive branch of the government undergoing structural changes, and transformation sweeping throughout all areas of economy, culture and social life. The repertoire included stage productions of the most interesting novels for children and teenagers which had up until then been absent from thespian arts. The theatre took its first steps in promoting new European literature for children. Innovatory scenographic suggestions taught audiences based on one's involvement in the performance. Never before in its history had ''Baj Pomorski'' spectacles received so many awards and honors. In 1994 Sieńko initiated [[Toruń's Meetings of Puppet Theaters]]. In 1999 this evolved to become [[Toruń's International Meetings of Puppet Theaters]] which has become a perpetual event in Toruń's puppet stage activity.
Toruń's International Meetings of Puppet Theatres is one of the few events of this type and size in Poland. It is held in October on a yearly basis. Throughout this week of contests and challenges one can see the most interesting theatres from around the world&amp;nbsp;–masters of puppetry, artists nurturing the tradition of the puppet theatre, and groups searching and experimenting within the nature of the loosely termed ''animation theatre''. Eleven events have been held thus far, confirming the high rank of the festival from a list of theatrical events both within and beyond Poland.

The present director of ''Baj Pomorski'' has since made Toruń's puppet stage into an open theatre, vividly responding to the city's needs and present-day trends. Its message, though targeted mostly at children and teenagers, is intended to reach every student and adult. Hopes for the coming years are for the modernization and development of the theatre's main building. Planned on a wide scale it will change its look, making it one of Poland's most modern and interesting stages, and not only from the architectural point of view. By giving the building the characteristics of an enormous, magical, theatrical wardrobe it will be transformed into a place where, for both Toruń's residents and tourists alike, it can serve as the locale for interplay, wherein the mysteries of its theatre and the beauty of its architecture enwrap together the Old and New Town settings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1770">'''''Berg's Review of Games''''' ({{aka}} ''BROG'') was a publication started by [[game designer]] [[Richard Berg]]. The magazine debuted in 1991 and has since made its archive available on online. The publication featured reviews of [[Wargame (video games)|wargame]]s.

The magazine is known for its thoughtful but often savage tone.  One World War II game received the review: "Playing this game makes Sisyphus' task a lark in the park."

Every year, ''Berg's Review of Games'' hands out the satirical "Little Macs," which are awarded for dubious achievements in gaming. The award is named for recalcitrant [[American Civil War]] general [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]].  No game or designer is immune, as one of Berg's own games was awarded a "Little Mac" for using game pieces with cardstock so thin that the pieces as to be described as "see through."

''BROG'' was inducted into the [[Origins Award|Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design's Hall of Fame]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1997/list-of-winners| title=Origins Award Winners (1997)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design| accessdate=2008-02-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080130144333/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1997/list-of-winners &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cigar boxes''' are rectangular [[juggling prop|props]] used in [[juggling]]. Cigar box [[object manipulation|manipulation]] began as a [[vaudeville]] act in the United States between the 1880s and 1920s, and was popularized by [[W. C. Fields]].&lt;ref name="flow"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.flowcircuskids.com/boxes.html | title = Cigar Boxes | publisher = Flow Circus Kids | accessdate = 5 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130829052721/http://flowcircuskids.com/boxes.html | archivedate = 29 August 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, performers would take actual [[cigar box|boxes that cigars were stored in]] and nail them shut to create their juggling props. Today, cigar boxes for juggling are typically purpose-built, hollow wooden or plastic blocks with suede or foam rubber padding attached to the sides.&lt;ref name="flow"/&gt;

==Technique==
Cigar boxes are juggled by holding a box in each hand and tossing and flipping a third box in between them. Routines performed with cigar boxes may also include quick midair box-exchanging tricks, balancing tricks, and more.&lt;ref name="flow"/&gt; Most tricks are done with three boxes; more advanced routines may include more than three.

Rather than the "flowing" style of ball juggling, cigar boxes have what is often referred to as a "stop-and-start" style. In effect, this means that after the majority of tricks the boxes return to the home position (three or more boxes in a line, smallest ends together) and stop before the juggler starts the next trick.  

Most cigar box tricks are achieved by bouncing up and down (normally from the knees, keeping one's arms in the same place relative to one's body). The trick is started at the apex of the 'bounce' and the boxes are pinned in the home position on the downstroke, preferably at the same altitude at which they started. This leads to the visual effect of the boxes being connected by an invisible wire (in tricks where the boxes not involved in the trick are separate; see "take out" below) or it can appear as if the boxes are magnetic in some way (where two boxes remain 'stuck' together in the air; see "end round" below). This is just an illusion; the boxes are not in any way connected.

==Records==
In 1977 Kris Kremo set a [[Guinness World Record]] of releasing one box and catching it after a quadruple pirouette.&lt;ref&gt;Veress Entertainment. [http://www.veress.se/kriskremo.htm "Kris Kremo".] Retrieved 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Kristian Kristof broke the record by releasing all three boxes and catching them after a quadruple pirouette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gulfnews.com/life-style/people/catch-all-kristian-kristof-1.660748 | title = Catch all: Kristian Kristof | author = Feby Imthias | publisher = ''[[Gulf News]]'' | date = 6 August 2010 | accessdate = 5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world record for the most cigar boxes balanced is on the chin is 223 set by ''Ashrita Furman'' (USA) at The Culture Project Theatre, New York City, New York, USA, on 12 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-cigar-boxes-balanced-on-chin | title = Most Cigar Boxes Balanced on Chin | publisher = ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' | accessdate = 8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Whereas vaudeville performers originally tended to use actual cigar boxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://historicaljugglingprops.com/other-rare-props/ | title = Other Rare Props | publisher = Historical Juggling Props | accessdate = 5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; today, the props for cigar box routines are usually built specifically for [[object manipulation|manipulation]].  They may be constructed from various materials, including plastic, plywood, or even wall paneling.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Ragatz. [http://www.juggling.org/help/circus-arts/cigar-boxes.html "Cigar Boxes".] Retrieved 5 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  They are sometimes padded on the ends and/or the sides with [[suede]], [[foam rubber]], or a felt-like material to provide extra friction on the catch.  Foam yoga blocks are also the right size and shape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5143">'''Clearly Impossible''' is a variation of the [[illusion]] of [[sawing a woman in half]] devised by [[The Pendragons|Jonathan Pendragon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://magictelevision.org/portal/1998/the-art-of-magic.html
 |title = The Art of Magic
 |publisher = Magic Television
 |accessdate = February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;Schneider, A., "A New Clear Sawing", ''Genii'' magazine, June 1993 (Vol 56, No 6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moehring, J., "The Century: The Pendragons", ''Magic'' magazine, Vol.8 No.12 (August 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The illusion is very similar in principle and performance to the older "Thin Model" versions of sawing a woman in half, with the exception that the boxes used to cover the assistant being divided are clear, rather than opaque. In basic concept, it is very similar to the transparent sawing developed by Les Arnold in the late 1970s. However, in the Pendragons version, the boxes are much smaller, and are never covered at any point during the illusion. As a result, the assistant within the boxes remains in full view throughout, making this a particularly baffling illusion for the audience.

===Performance===
The illusion usually begins with the magician showing the audience a low table, designed to split into two halves. The main assistant is then introduced, and lies down on the table. Other assistants then place two boxes over the assistant, with clear sides and tops. As the upper box is placed over them, the main assistant extends their arm out of the open side of the box, while their head and feet extend out of the ends of the two boxes. Small stocks are then used to restrain the assistant's feet and neck. Because the boxes have clear sides, the audience is able to see right through them, and can see that the assistant has not curled up inside the upper box, as is described in many commonly available magic books for the "Thin Model" sawing. 

The magician then cuts through the box using either a saw or sword (although some performers skip this step), and dividers are placed into the box either side of the cut. With the dividers in place, the two halves of the table are unlocked and pulled apart. As the assistant has been in full view of the audience throughout the illusion, it appears that they have been separated into two halves, the impossibility of this situation helping to give the illusion its name. The halves of the table are then pushed back together, the dividers removed, and the unharmed assistant released from the stocks and boxes.&lt;ref&gt;The Pendragons performing Clearly Impossible in Cincinnati 1998 PBS TV Special [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95hjcHFDEw]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable performances==
While she was in a relationship with [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] and not otherwise occupied with modelling work, [[Claudia Schiffer]] often assisted Copperfield in his stage shows as a "special guest assistant". Part of these shows was a performance of Clearly Impossible, with Schiffer as the assistant being sawed in half by Copperfield.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, S. "Claudia Schiffer: From Supermodel to Magician's Assistant". ''Genii'' magazine, August 1996, (Vol 59, No 8.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/celebs/men/entertainment/david-copperfield/index.html David Copperfield] ''AskMen.com''. Retrieved 26 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film.com/features/story/top-10-celebrity-odd-couples/27780478 Top 10 Celebrity Odd Couples] ''Film.com''. Retrieved 26 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1996 TV special ''Champions of Magic'', Jonathan Pendragon performed the illusion on the show's host, [[Princess Stéphanie of Monaco]].

In November 2004, singer [[Shania Twain]] appeared on the [[BBC]] charity telethon ''[[Children in Need]]'' as a celebrity assistant in a magic act, being sawed in half in a performance of Clearly Impossible.

While appearing on a local TV talk show during a promotional visit to Japan in 2006, actress [[Mischa Barton]] took part in a performance of the illusion in which she was sawed in half by a local magician.

Italian singer [[Sabrina Salerno]] assisted illusionist Martin in a televised performance of Clearly Impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUVn4HtiW1U YouTube clip of performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

While presenting ''SM:TV Live'', British TV presenter [[Cat Deeley]] was the first British celebrity to be sawed in half in a version of Clearly Impossible.

During a promotional visit to Europe, [[Jessica Simpson]] participated in a performance of the illusion where she was sawed in half by illusionist [[Hans Klok]], who used a large circular saw to divide her in two.

When she appeared on a Mexican talk show, [[Penélope Cruz]] took part in a performance of this illusion.

In February and March 2012, Klok visited the UK with his stage show The Houdini Experience, playing a five-week run. During the press night at the Peacock Theatre in London, he amazed the audience of celebrity guests when he invited actress Louisa Lytton up onto the stage and, without any prior rehearsal, sawed her in half in his Clearly Impossible illusion.

A '''dual narrative''' is a form of [[narrative]] that tells a story in two different perspectives, usually two different people. '''Dual narrative''' is also an effective technique that can be used to tell the story of people (or one person) at two different points in time ([[Postcards from No Man's Land]], [[Great Expectations]]).
It is used to show parallels or emphasise differences in the lifestyles or points-of-view of different places or time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haertsch|first=Gretchen|title=The Dual Narrative- Does it Work?|url=http://birthofanovel.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/the-dual-narrative-does-it-work/|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A manga series drawn by Yūki Dōmoto is serialized in ''[[Dengeki G's Comic]]''. A 12-episode anime television series by [[Diomedéa]] aired from October to December 2016.

==Plot==
The story revolves around Chitose Karasuma, a voice actress who has been working in the anime industry for a year. Although she believes she is talented, she thinks the anime industry is rotten as she has only been voicing minor characters. One day, an opportunity arises for her to voice a main role in an upcoming anime adaptation of a light novel as an [[Japanese idol|idol]] voice actress with four other girls.

:Chitose is a university student and aspiring [[Voice acting in Japan|voice actress]] whose agency is Number One Produce. She is the voice of Yuna, one of the five main heroines in the upcoming anime series ''Millennium Princess x Kowloon Overlord''. She has a positive attitude and high confidence, and initially thinks that she has talent for voice acting but just did not get enough chances. However this is in contrast with Chitose being very cynical. She is nicknamed "Chii-sama".

:Kuzu-P (Kuzu Producer) is a producer who is in charge of the planning and production of the anime series ''Millennium Princess x Kowloon Overlord''. He does not seem to care about the quality of an anime as long as money is made.

:He is the president of the Number One Produce who has an energetic personality and shares a similar carefree and reckless personality like Kuzu-P. He also shares Kuzu-P's utter indifference to the quality of his company's anime, having begun the novel's plot simply because he was vaguely aware that light novels and adaptations of them were in vogue and therefore decided to try and cash in while he still could.

'''''Holy Mission''''' is a [[medieval fantasy]] [[MUD]] based in Linz, Austria.{{R|hmhome|netgames}}  Founded in 1992 and still online, it is one of the longest-running MUDs.{{R|hmhist}}  It uses the [[LPMud]] server software,{{R|hmhome|netgames}} and has been seen as typifying the "LPMud genre".{{R|benediktciskowski}}  (LPMud is properly a technical infrastructure, not a game genre, but some elements are popularly considered characteristic of games based on it.)  Its name does not reflect any particular religious themes.{{R|benediktciskowski}}

It is most notable in that, following extended political disagreements with the Arch-Wizards on the direction of the game, [[Sarah Eaglesfield]] (who was an Elder named "Redsexy" and guild master of both the Summoner and the Jedi guild at the time) deleted all files from the MUD server in 1998 (with aid from fellow elders, "Tatsuo" and "Wilbie"). Despite her keeping a backup of all the game files, the original driver could not be found, and the MUD was never fully restored. Redsexy was promoted to a "Lord" for her work on the restoration project. &lt;ref name=redsexy&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/holymissionproject/people/redsexy "Holy Mission Restoration Project"].Redsexy's Profile Holy Mission Restoration Project &lt;/ref&gt;

Former Arch-Wizard "Kiri" is still actively involved in attempting to restore the original MUD.&lt;ref name=hmr&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/holymissionproject/ "Holy Mission Restoration Project"].Holy Mission Restoration Project &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kiri&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/holymissionproject/people/kiri "Holy Mission Restoration Project"].Holy Mission Restoration Project &lt;/ref&gt;

One version of Holy Mission can still be reached at telnet://wildsau.holy-mission.org:81.

'''''Home Media Magazine''''' was a trade publication that covered various aspects of the [[entertainment industry|home entertainment industry]], most notably home video distribution via VHS, DVD, [[Blu-ray]], and digital copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.homemediamagazine.com/about-us/about-us|title=About us|work=Home Media Magazine|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also covered news relating to consumer electronics, video games, home video distributors and various forms of digital distribution of movie and TV content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.brighthub.com/electronics/home-theater/articles/62370.aspx|title=Top 4 Home Theater Magazines|work=Bright Hub|date=January 10, 2010|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The magazine was founded in 1979 and was known as ''Video Store Magazine'' until 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050113005500/en/Home-Media-Retailing-Video-Store-Magazine|title=Home Media Retailing: A New Name and Look for Video Store Magazine|work=Business News|date=January 15, 2005|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it became ''Home Media Retailing''. To further its consumer focus, the magazine dropped "Retailing" at the beginning of 2007. In 2014 the magazine's print edition was reduced to biweekly and in 2015, to monthly; at the same time, the publication increased its web presence through a daily e-newsletter and frequent "breaking news" alerts. ''HM'' also published frequent special issues, such as special reports on 4K Ultra HD, Vidity, and UltraViolet; rankings of the top women in home entertainment, key digital drivers, and leading disruptors; and, in 2011, a salute to executives in home entertainment under the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110914005477/en/Home-Media-Magazine-Presents-%E2%80%9CForty-Forty%E2%80%9D|title=Home Media Magazine Presents 'Forty Under Forty'|work=BusinessWire|date=September 14, 2011|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine was based in Santa Ana, California, and was a subsidiary of the Questex Media Group.

In July 2006, ''HM'' launched a consumer magazine called ''Agent DVD'', a semi-regular periodical focusing on home entertainment news. The first issue debuted at the 2006 [[Comic Con International]] in San Diego, California, and focused on titles and news that would appeal to convention-goers. The consumer magazine was later rebranded as ''Home Media Insider'' and offered only in digital form.

Additionally, ''Home Media Magazine'' presented annual awards covering the best DVD and Blu-ray products.

Questex ceased production of ''Home Media Magazine'' after the December 2017 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bluetoad.com/publication/?i=462137&amp;ver=html5&amp;p=3|title=What a Long, Strange Trip|work=Home Media Magazine|date=December 18, 2017|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2018, the core team responsible for producing the ''Home Media Magazine'' print and online properties returned with an independent operation called '''''Media Play News''''' that offers the same home entertainment focus as its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.mediaplaynews.com/redefining-home-entertainment/|title=Redefining Home Entertainment – Welcome to Media Play News!|work=Media Play News|date=January 2, 2018|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2999">In [[game theory]], the '''homicidal chauffeur problem''' is a mathematical [[Pursuit-evasion|pursuit problem]] which pits a hypothetical runner, who can only move slowly, but is highly maneuverable, against the driver of a motor vehicle, which is much faster but far less maneuverable, who is attempting to run him down. Both runner and driver are assumed to never tire. The question to be solved is: under what circumstances, and with what strategy, can the driver of the car guarantee that he can always catch the pedestrian, or the pedestrian guarantee that he can indefinitely elude the car?

The problem is often used as an unclassified proxy for [[missile defence]] and other military targeting, allowing scientists to publish on it without security implications.

The problem was proposed by [[Rufus Isaacs (game theorist)|Rufus Isaacs]] in a 1951 report&lt;ref&gt;R. Isaacs, [http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P257.html Games of Pursuit], RAND Corporation (1951)&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[RAND Corporation]], and in the book ''Differential Games''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Isaacs, ''Differential Games: A Mathematical Theory with Applications to Warfare and Pursuit, Control and Optimization'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1965), PP 349&amp;ndash;350.&lt;/ref&gt;

The homicidal chauffeur problem is a classic example of a [[differential game]] played in [[continuous time]] in a continuous [[state space]]. The [[calculus of variations]] and [[level set]] methods can be used as a mathematical framework for investigating solutions of the problem. Although the problem is phrased as a recreational problem, it is an important [[model problem]] for mathematics used in a number of real-world applications.

A discrete version of the problem was described by [[Martin Gardner]] (in his book ''Mathematical Carnival'', chapter 16), where a squad car of speed 2 chases a crook of speed 1 on a rectangular grid, where the squad car but not the crook is constrained not to make left-hand turns or U-turns.

"'''In My Country There Is Problem'''", also known as "'''Throw the Jew Down the Well'''" after the song's key line, is a song written by [[United Kingdom|British]] comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] for his comic character [[Borat Sagdiyev]]. It features in the episode "Peace" of the series 3 of ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'', in the 'Country Music' segment of "Borat's Guide to the USA (Part 2)", that focuses heavily on the (positive) reaction of the patrons of an Arizona country and western bar to the [[antisemitic]] sentiments of the song. It appeared in ''[[Stereophonic Musical Listenings That Have Been Origin in Moving Film "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"]]''.

Baron Cohen's character Borat is a simple-minded [[antisemitic]] and [[antiziganistic]] [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] journalist who is depicted in ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' as attempting to learn about the culture of the [[United Kingdom]] and, in the HBO series, the [[United States]]. In interviews, Baron Cohen, who is [[Jews|Jewish]], has stated that the purpose of Borat was both to expose antisemitism in his interview subjects, as well as simple indifference to antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6153420.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cohen defends 'racist' Borat film | date=2006-11-16 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks/page/3 Sacha Baron Cohen - the Real Borat - Finally Speaks : Rolling Stone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Cohen, as Borat, typically displays his character's fear and hatred of Jews frequently on the show.

The song itself is a country-style song played on [[acoustic guitar]] consisting of three verses. The first verse is a complaint about the state of [[transportation in Kazakhstan]], which is followed in a refrain with a call to "Throw transport down the well—so my country can be free." The second verse is directed at the Jews of Kazakhstan, alleging they "take everybody's money", and calling for the listeners to "Throw the Jew down the well". The third verse contains a warning for the listener to "be careful of [the Jew's] teeth" before repeating the second refrain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findlyrics.com/borat/in_my_country_there_is_problem Borat - In My Country There Is Problem Lyrics | FindLyrics.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125232012/http://www.findlyrics.com/borat/in_my_country_there_is_problem |date=January 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
Borat debuted the song in the third episode of the third season of ''Da Ali G Show, "Peace"'' on [[HBO]] on 1 August 2004, as the climax of the character's investigation of country music. He sang the song at a [[country music]] club in [[Tucson, Arizona]], and managed to drive much of the club's patronage to cheer and sing along by the end of the song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webgeordie.co.uk/borat/usa_country.htm The Unofficial Borat Homepage | Borat's Guide to the USA II, Episode Three: Country Music&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the episode had been broadcast, ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' published an article which claimed that the song depicted on the show was in fact a small segment of Borat's full performance at the bar. According to the article, Borat had been on stage for over two hours when the sketch was filmed, and the full performance also contained a rant about throwing his family down the well which helped make it clear that Borat's actions were indeed a joke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/5116/ "Comic Pushes Limits in Antisemitic Sing-along - Forward.com"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Jody Rosen, writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', stated that with the song as well as his other antics Borat managed to offend everyone:

{{quote|... Borat's performance of "In My Country There Is Problem (Throw the Jew Down the Well)" on an episode of Da Ali G Show [is] a densely packed piece of sociopolitical [[parody]]: an incitement to [[pogrom]] ("Throw the Jew down the well/ So my country can be free/ You must grab him by his horns/ Then we have a big party") sung by a British Jew disguised as a [[Central Asia]]n bumpkin before a whooping, [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Bud]]-swilling audience at a Tucson, Ariz., [[Honky tonk|honky-tonk]]. It's hilarious. It's catchy. And it's a perfect distillation of Borat's [[Satire|satirical]] attack, designed to offend and indict just about everyone: [[Old Europe (politics)|Old Europe]] and [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]], fulminating [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]]ers and piously [[Political correctness|PC]] [[Liberalism|liberals]],  in addition to Kazakhstan's President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] and [[Anti-Defamation League]] director [[Abraham Foxman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Jody Rosen, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]  |date=December 17, 2006  |title= Borat Owes Me 97 Dollars: How Sacha Baron Cohen is Jewish vaudeville.|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2152773/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the episode had been broadcast, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] sent Baron Cohen an open letter warning him that, while they understood the message he had intended the sketch to deliver, they were concerned that this aspect may not have been grasped by his audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/media_watch/tv/20040809-hbo.htm Letter to Sacha Baron Cohen ("Ali G")&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607154747/http://www.adl.org/media_watch/tv/20040809-hbo.htm |date=2007-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization issued a similar statement prior to the release of the Borat film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [[Anti-Defamation League]]|date= 17 December 2006|title= Statement On The Comedy Of Sacha Baron Cohen, A.K.A. "Borat"|url= http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/4898_00.htm|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070212080423/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/4898_00.htm|archivedate= 12 February 2007|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, notably columnists [[David Brooks (commentator)|David Brooks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/16/opinion/16brooks.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Brooks | title=The Heyday of Snobbery | date=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Krauthammer]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/219322/throw-jew-joke-down-well/charles-krauthammer&lt;/ref&gt; have expressed the opinion that the song, rather than being biting satire, was "a supreme display of elite snobbery reveling in the humiliation of the hoaxed [[hillbilly]]."

They developed the slow-paced, melancholy blackface type of comedy, and were forerunners of Moran and Mack and Amos n' Andy. &lt;!--Theirs was the first act to receive top billing on the Keith Circuit, and, in their time, received the biggest vaudeville contract from Keith. McIntyre was born at Kenosha, WI, and before he was out of his teens was already amusing audiences with impromptu songs and dances on the trains where he peddled candy. Began his professional career as a clog-dancer, Pete Kerwin’s Concert Hall, Chicago, which he left for a job with Katie Putnam’s ballad and dancing show. Quit this company to join McKenzie’s Circus, 1870; Burton &amp; Ridgeway’s Minstrel’s, 1871; 3 years later, teamed with Tom Heath, another great burnt cork man, and the act was born&amp;nbsp;– Mclntyre playing the lazy, drawling Alexander and Heath doing a foil as the pompous, polysyllabic Hennery. Fame came quickly, all over the world, and soon their act drew as high as $2,000 a week. Circuses included Anderson &amp; Co., 1879, also Burr Robbins’ and others. McIntyre married a dancer and balladeer, Emma Young, professionally known as Maude Clifford. Among their most popular skits were Georgia Minstrels, Man From Montana, Flying to Jail, and Waiting at the Church. But The Ham Tree always remained the most popular item in their rtoire. Retired from the stage, 1919, but continued to appear in benefit performances now and then. Guested on Rudy Vallee radio program, 1832. When McIntyr passed away, Heath was lying on a sick bed a few miles away, dangerously ill.  --&gt;|publisher=[[William L. Slout]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and early career ==
McIntyre was born in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and began working at a young age to support his widowed mother.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre at age 13 is described as an "actor in travelling theatre" in ''1870 US Federal Census'', Kenosha Ward 1, Kenosha, Wisconsin, Roll M593_1770, p. 201, document available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He showed an early aptitude for dancing and acting. McIntyre sold candy on trains and when "the passengers were in danger of being bored Jim would get out in the aisles and entertain them with his clever acting."&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=James McIntyre, Stage Star, Dies  |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A17FA3C5D12738DDDA00994D0405B878FF1D3 |quote=Vaudeville Favorite Stricken at 80, While Partner, 84, Lies Ill Near By.

In his early teens he was keen on joining the circus troupes that passed through [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]. His mother initially prevented him from doing so. In 1870 he did join the [[McKenzie circus]] and then in 1871 joined the [[Burton and Ridgeway]] minstrels and toured the South and Western states for a year. Later he performed with the [[Katie Putnam Troupe]], and toured with the [[Great Transatlantic circus]] in 1873.&lt;ref name="James McIntyre"&gt;See entry [http://www.circushistory.org/Olympians/OlympiansMc.htm "James McIntyre"] in ''Olympians of the Sawdust Circle'', Circus Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Emma Maude Young (1862–1935). She was a dancer and balladeer known by the stage names of "Maude Clifford", and "Maud Clifton" and she performed as part of the Katie Putnam Troupe.&lt;ref name="James McIntyre" /&gt; Although they had no natural born children of their own they did adopt a daughter Maud Ainsworth Young (1892–1966).&lt;ref&gt;Maud McIntyre aged 17 is described as "adopted daughter" in ''1910 US Federal Census'', Brooklyn Ward 32, Kings County, New York, Roll: T624_985, p9B, Enumeration District 1000, available to subscribers at http://www.ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the biological daughter of Emma's older sister Annie Young (1860–1906) and Emma's brother-in-law Joseph Charles Ainsworth.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Brown and Rosemary Brown, ''They Lie in Wait To Deceive'', Volume 3, Mesa, Arizona: Brownsworth Publishing, 1986, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; In adult life Maud Ainsworth McIntyre became the wife of the Brooklyn criminal trial lawyer and Kings County judge [[George Washington Martin II]] (1876–1948).&lt;ref&gt;"Mr McIntyre left no close relatives.

In his peak years as a star performer he gave an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'' in which he claimed to have been responsible for introducing to vaudeville the Buck and Wing style of dance that is one form of [[tap dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Introducing Ragtime |quote= |work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 4, 1916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnership with Heath ==
In 1874 he met [[Thomas Kurton Heath]] (1853–1938) in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=When McIntyre and Heath First Met |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/16/archives/when-mcintyre-and-heath-first-met.html |quote=James McIntyre and Thomas Heath met in San Antonio in 1874, and then and there began a stage partnership which still endures and is the longest of its kind in the world.

McIntyre played the character of Alexander Hambletonian who was a buffoonish stable-boy. Heath acted as "Henry Jones" a clever black entertainer who frequently outwits Alexander. Their routines included an oft-performed skit known as the Georgia Minstrels where the character Henry persuades the witless Alexander to quit working as a stable-boy and joins a traveling show where he is promised fame and fortune. None of the fame or fortune materializes and Alexander has comical and outrageous tasks to perform under Henry's direction which allowed them to act out comedic dialogue, dance and songs. Another skit, called the Ham Tree, and which formed the nucleus of a later stage play, involved the two characters discussing how ham grows on trees that are three hundred feet tall.

[[File:The Ham Tree Belle Gold 1906.jpg|thumb|right|The Ham Tree Belle Gold 1906]]Their acting partnership endured for some fifty years as they worked under the twin influential theatre managers of [[Tony Pastor]] and [[Benjamin Franklin Keith]] appearing as stars in both vaudeville and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Their blackface minstrel shows were an influential model followed by later film stars such as [[Al Jolson]]. Their best known plays included:

[[Image:Jog Dial 001.jpg|thumb|Jog Dial by [[Sony Ericsson]]]]

A '''jog dial''', '''jog wheel''', '''shuttle dial''', or '''shuttle wheel''' is a type of knob, ring, wheel, or dial which allows the user to shuttle or jog through [[music|audio]] or [[video]] media.  It is commonly found on models of [[CD player]]s which are made for [[disc jockey]]s, and on professional video equipment such as [[video tape recorder]]s.  More recently, they are found on [[handheld]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, and as the [[scroll wheel]] on [[Mouse (computing)|computer mice]].  "Jog" refers to going at a very slow speed, whereas "shuttle" refers to a very fast speed.

There are two basic types of wheels.  One type has no stops and can be spun the entire way around, because it is a relative [[rotary encoder]].  This type depends on tracking the actual motion of the dial: the faster it spins forward or back, the faster it fast-forwards or rewinds.  Once the dial stops moving, the media continues playing or remains paused at that point.   Another type has stops on either side, and often has three or so speeds which depend on how far it is turned.  Once the wheel is released, it [[spring (device)|spring]]s back to the middle position and the media pauses or begins playing again.

If the device is set or designed to pause after the wheel is used, the audio is often [[stutter]]ed, repeating a small section over and over again.  This is usually done on DJ CD players, for the purpose of [[beatmatching]], and is equivalent to an earlier [[turntablist]] DJ moving a [[phonograph]] record back and forth slightly to find the physical location of a starting [[beat (music)|beat]] within the groove.  On video, the pause is a freeze frame of the current [[video frame]].

[[Sony Corporation]] holds a patent for a 5-way version of jog dial. A 5-way jog dial allows up and down scrolling, right and left deflections, and a press-to-click action. Such jog dial was a feature of Sony [[CLIÉ]] [[PDA]] series and [[SonyEricsson]] [[P800]], [[Sony Ericsson P900|P900]] and [[P910]] smartphones. A 5-way jog dial has not been used by Sony or its subsidiaries since 2006.

'''Juvenile fantasy''' is [[children's literature]] with fantasy elements:  [[fantasy]] intended for readers not yet adult.  

The protagonists are usually children or teens who have unique abilities, gifts, possessions or even allies that allow them to face powerful adversaries. [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] is a powerful young wizard, one of the children of ''[[The Dark Is Rising]]'' series is an immature Old One with magical abilities, and in the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' series the children have magical items and animal allies.  The plot frequently incorporates a ''[[bildungsroman]]''.

In the earlier part of the 20th century, [[C. S. Lewis]] noted that fantasy was more accepted in juvenile literature, and therefore a writer interested in fantasy often wrote in it to find an audience.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, "On Juvenile Tastes", p 41, ''Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories'', {{ISBN|0-15-667897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lame duck''', in the context of a [[game]], is a player who remains in the game but has no chance of winning. It must be literally impossible&amp;nbsp;– not merely highly ''improbable''&amp;nbsp;– for a player to win for it to constitute a lame-duck scenario.

Lame ducks are often found in [[sport]]. The teams that are eliminated from [[playoff]] contention are lame ducks, and have nothing remaining to play for, often with several weeks of games remaining on the schedule. In some cases, ''losing'' the remaining games can be more favorable than attempting to win them, due to more favorable positioning in a [[draft (sports)|draft]] and the ability to land more talented players. Teams in Europe (especially those without drafts) discourage "losing out" by imposing a [[promotion and relegation|relegation system]] that expels the lowest teams from the league. A draft lottery is used in some North American professional leagues to discourage losing out by randomizing who gets the top draft picks, while still assuring the less talented teams have access to the players necessary to compete. (See: [[elimination from possibility of reaching postseason]])

A [[kingmaker scenario| kingmaker]] is a lame duck who retains the ability to influence (sometimes decisively) who, among other players, will win the game. In sports, the ''[[spoiler effect|spoiler]]'' plays a similar role.

Three of the submissions - ''Be With Me'', ''My Magic'', and ''Tatsumi'' were directed by Eric Khoo. Both films were among the first Singaporean films featured at the prestigious [[Cannes Film Festival]]. ''Be With Me'' features four interconnected stories, with virtually no spoken dialogue. The majority of the story is told in English subtitles reflecting the thoughts of the deaf and blind lead actress, Theresa Chan. It was accepted by [[AMPAS]] as the official entry from Singapore but subsequently disqualified for being more than 50% in English and not in a Foreign Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117935038.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Foreign Oscar pix lost in translation | first=Robert | last=Koehler | date=2005-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''My Magic'' tells the story of the relationship between an alcoholic Indo-Singaporean magician and his young son.

Two other submissions were large-scale musicals. In 1959, [[Colonial Singapore]] sent musical-drama ''The Kingdom and the Beauty'', set in Imperial China. Directed by a [[Hong Kong]] based-[[Mainland Chinese]] director and produced by the famed Hong Kong [[Shaw Brothers]] film studio, there was minimal Singaporean input in the film-making. Nearly fifty years later, independent Singapore sent ''881'', a candy-colored musical-comedy-drama about a pair of Singaporean sisters who aspire to become champions at traditional Singaporean [[getai]]. This "uniquely Singaporean" film became the highest grossing Singaporean film of 2007 &lt;ref&gt;Source: Singapore Film Commission&lt;/ref&gt; and was released commercially in Japan but it won few awards overseas.

==Background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
In 1974, during [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship]] (1973–1990), a film censorship decree allowed the banning of films.

In November 1996, after [[United International Pictures]] requested that ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' be rated, the film was allowed for audiences over 18. However, an ultra-conservative religious group filed an injunction to reverse the decision and in June 1997 the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]] banned the film. In September 1997 a civil liberties group took the case to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]]. In February 2001 the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] ruled that Chile was in violation of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] and that it should lift the ban on the film and modify its legislation to comply with the convention. In August 2001 a constitutional reform eliminated film censorship and the film appeared on video stores. In January 2003 a new film rating law was published and the film was given an "over 18" rating. The film premiered on 13 March 2003 at a theater in [[Santiago]].

'''''LOGOS cards''''' is a [[digital collectible card game]] developed for [[Second Life]].
The game was first conceptualized by Austrian developer Florian Kraner in 2008. Development began in earnest early 2009 with the addition of Darien Caldwell to the creative team. The full game was released on July 1, 2010.

== Basics ==

LOGOS is played by two players. Both of them each start with 100.000 Hit Points and it is their objective to reduce the Hit Points of their opponent to 0 first.
They do so by battling with cards that follow a [[Rock-paper-scissors]] principle.
LOGOS cards is played in Second Life using a [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]. It consists of two SL items that have to be worn and will add a display of the hand dealt to you as well as some other elements to the screen. The game can be played anywhere in Second Life on the go.
This allows players to play the game in a fully emersive 3D environment, where they have full control over how their avatars and surroundings are represented.
The community that has formed is constantly adding and maintaining new play areas where players organize tournaments and events.

== Cards ==
Cardmotives are mostly generated from Second Life sceneries and sorted into 5 categories of cards: Energy, Matter, Information, Life and Neutral. When building decks the player needs to keep combo requirements and effects for their cards in mind.

== Technology ==

LOGOS makes use of Googles [[App Engine]], which allows the Second Life game to be enhanced by a website interface that allows players to edit card decks and more for no cost.

'''Massive Development GmbH''' was a [[video game developer]] based in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]]. Founded as '''Massive Development GbR''', the company was active between 1994 and 2005 and is primarily known for their [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] video games ''[[Archimedean Dynasty]]'' and ''[[AquaNox]]'', which have attained somewhat of a [[cult status]].

== History ==
Massive Development was founded in 1994 by Alexander Jorias, Ingo Frick and Oliver Weirich in Mannheim as Massive Development GbR.
Their first product was the porting of the [[Amiga]] game ''[[The Settlers]]'' to [[MS-DOS]] in 1994. In 1996 they released the successful [[science-fiction]] [[submarine]] [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] [[video game]] ''Archimedean Dynasty'', published by [[Blue Byte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&amp;id=2428 | title = Power Play 12/96, Seiten 76-78 | author = jamyz1102 | website = [[Kultboy.com]] | language = DE | accessdate = 17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.massive.de/project_sf/sf_press_d.html | title = Schleichfahrt - Presseberichte - Deutschland | date = 30 October 1996 | website = Massive Development | language = DE | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20011116231929/http://www.massive.de/project_sf/sf_press_d.html | archivedate = 16 November 2001 | accessdate = 17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://corny.silentdepth.com/Downloads/sfmanual.pdf | title = Schleichfahrt - Vom Tageslicht vergessen, von der Finsternis beherrscht! | author = Massive Development | date = 2000 | website = [[SilentDepth.com]] | language = DE | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120317081231/http://corny.silentdepth.com/Downloads/sfmanual.pdf | archivedate = 17 March 2012 |accessdate = 17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, Massive Development was bought by the Austrian publisher [[JoWooD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.massive.de/news/news_d.shtml | title = News und Presseerklärungen - JoWood [PE] | last = Reis | first = Thomas | date = 14 December 2000 | website = Massive Development | publisher = [[JoWooD]] | language = DE | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010203192600/http://www.massive.de/news/news_d.shtml | archivedate = 3 February 2001 | accessdate = 17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 2000, Massive Development worked on its own game engine called "krass Engine", which was used for their next title ''[[AquaNox#AquaNox|AquaNox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.massive.de/project_kr/krass_tec_d.html | title = krass(tm) Engine - Technische Details | date = 2000 | website = Massive Development | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020415004053/http://www.massive.de/project_kr/krass_tec_d.html | archivedate = 15 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first games to make use of the new capabilities of [[graphic card]]s with [[T&amp;L]] hardware, which is why ''AquaNox'' was also [[Product bundling|bundled]] with new graphic cards.

Revenue generation is complete amount of money that is generated during a specific time period. The money is used to calculate business profits.

[[Media house]]s make their money through [[Direct Payment]] and [[Indirect Payment]]. Direct Payment is the money a consumer pays the media house in exchange for a good or service. This would be the payment from the consumer for a newspaper, paying to call into a radio station or paying to receive cable. Subscriptions are also another form of direct payment. In this instance the customer would pay the company, normally a magazine or a comic book a set fee of money under a contracted time and receive weekly or monthly issues.
Indirect payment is money companies earn outside of what the consumer pays for. Companies use their platforms to place advertisements and direct payment by politicians for advertise amongst their content for consumers.

[[File:Miho museum02n3872.jpg|thumb|280px|Miho Museum In Autumn]]
The '''Miho Museum''' is located southeast of [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]], near the town of [[Shigaraki, Shiga|Shigaraki]], in [[Shiga Prefecture]]. It is also the headquarters of Shumeikai, a new religious group founded by Mihoko Koyama.

== History ==
The museum was the dream of Mihoko Koyama (after whom it is named), founder of the religious organization [[Shinji Shumeikai]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindelauf|first1=Perrin|title=Luck, trickery and treasure in Koka City|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2009/03/08/travel/luck-trickery-and-treasure-in-koka-city/#.U_yjsoCSwn0|accessdate=26 August 2014|date=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now said to have some 300,000 members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Shinto|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=640}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinji Shumeikai is illegal in European countries and is a religious cult that punishes member that do not make adequate financial contributions. Furthermore, in the 1990s Koyama commissioned the museum to be built close to the Shumei temple in the Shiga mountains. 

==Collection==
The Miho Museum houses Mihoko Koyama's private collection of Asian and Western antiques bought on the world market by the Shumei organisation in the years before the museum was opened in 1997. While Koyama began acquiring stoneware tea ceremony vessels as early as the 1950s, the bulk of the museum's acquisitions were made in the 1990s. There are over two thousand pieces in the permanent collection, of which approximately 250 are displayed at any one time.&lt;ref name="nyt-reif"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reif|first=Rita|title=ARTS/ARTIFACTS; A Japanese Vision of the Ancient World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/16/arts/arts-artifacts-a-japanese-vision-of-the-ancient-world.html|accessdate=13 August 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the objects in the collection are more than 1,200 objects that appear to have been produced in Achaemenid Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=John|title=The Oxus Treasure in the British Museum|journal=[[Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia]]|date=1 September 2004|volume=10|issue=3|page=334|doi=10.1163/1570057042596397|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1570057042596397|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have claimed these objects are part of the [[Oxus Treasure]], lost shortly after its discovery in 1877 and rediscovered in Afghanistan in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Southampton|first1=Kathy Judelson|last2=Pichikyan|first2=I.R.|title=Rebirth of the Oxus Treasure: Second Part of the Oxus Treasure From the Miho Museum Collection|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|date=1 January 1998|volume=4|issue=4|pages=306–383 [308–309]|doi=10.1163/157005797X00126|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/157005797x00126|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of a unique findspot for both the Miho acquisitions and the British Museum's material, however, has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muscarella|first1=Oscar White|title=Museum Constructions of the Oxus Treasures: Forgeries of Provenience and Ancient Culture|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|date=1 November 2003|volume=9|issue=3|pages=259–275|doi=10.1163/157005703770961778|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/157005703770961778|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the items in the collection were acquired in collaboration with the art dealer Noriyoshi Horiuchi over the course of just six years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melikian|first1=Souren|title=A Splendid Art Collection Goes On Display in Japan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/06/style/06iht-museum.t.html|accessdate=26 August 2014|date=November 6, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some have little or no known [[provenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yvXTcGC5CwQC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=miho+museum+looted&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8tmq0MmKma&amp;sig=Vb_B5T69mIENx-5Jw-UTRcghHQ4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v7JYT5njA8jV8QPJ-7DVDg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=miho%20museum%20looted&amp;f=false |title=Art and Cultural Heritage: Law, Policy and Practice |editor=Hoffman, Barbara T. |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-85764-2 |pages=54f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/11/italy.japan |title=Italy to ask Japan for return of 'looted' antiques |author=McCurry, Justin |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 January 2007 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the museum acknowledged that a sixth-century statue of a Boddhisatva in its collection was the same sculpture which been stolen from a public garden in [[Shandong]] province, China in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sims|first1=Calvin|title=Japanese Agree A Stolen Statue Will Be Sent Back to China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/18/arts/japanese-agree-a-stolen-statue-will-be-sent-back-to-china.html|accessdate=26 August 2014|date=April 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abe|first1=Stanley|title=Review: Return of the Buddha: The Qingzhou Discoveries by Lukas Nickel|journal=Artibus Asiae|date=2002|volume=62|issue=2|page=296|jstor=3250269|doi=10.2307/3250269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihoko Koyama and her daughter, Hiroko Koyama, commissioned the architect [[I. M. Pei]] to design the Miho Museum. I. M. Pei's design, which he came to call [[Shangri-La]], is executed in a hilly and forested landscape.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Kenneth |title=Miho Lets Art Speak For Itself|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-11-18/entertainment/17270344_1_10th-anniversary-pedestrian-tunnel-objects|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=18 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately three-quarters of the 17,400 square meter building is situated underground, carved out of a rocky mountaintop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenblatt|first=Arthur |title=Building type basics for museums|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-471-34915-1|pages=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTggWMQ42qQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=shinji+shumeikai&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q6BkTOj1N8P98QbMi8XsCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=shinji%20shumeikai&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof is a large glass and steel construction, while the exterior and interior walls and floor are made of a warm beige-colored [[limestone]] from [[France]] – the same material used by Pei in the reception hall of the [[Louvre]]. The structural engineer for this project was Leslie E. Robertson Associates.

Pei continued to make changes to the design of the galleries during construction as new pieces were acquired for the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dobrzynski|first1=Judith|title=A Trek Well Worth Taking|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323977304578654112058864372?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424127887323977304578654112058864372.html|accessdate=26 August 2014|date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pei had earlier designed the bell tower at Misono,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shumei – Art and Beauty|url=http://www.shumei.org/artandbeauty/misono_tour.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the international headquarters and spiritual center of the Shumei organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8543">{{nihongo|'''Mineko Iwasaki'''|岩崎 峰子|''Iwasaki Mineko''}} also known as {{nihongo|'''Mineko Iwasaki'''|岩崎 究香|''Iwasaki Mineko''}}, born {{nihongo|'''Masako Tanaka'''|田中 政子|''Tanaka Masako''|born 2 November 1949}}, is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[businesswoman]], author and former [[geiko]] (Kyoto term for [[geisha]]). Iwasaki was the most famous geiko in [[Japan]] until her sudden publicized retirement at the age of 29. Known for her performances for celebrity and royalty during her geisha life, Iwasaki was an established heir or ''atotori'' to her geisha house (okiya) while she was just an [[maiko|apprentice]].

American author [[Arthur Golden]] interviewed her for background information when writing his 1997 book, ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard Lloyd |last=Parry |coauthors= |title=The Queen and the Geisha |date=2006-03-30 |publisher= |url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/times_tokyo_weblog/2006/03/the_queen_and_t_1.html |work=Times Online |pages= |accessdate=2008-01-14 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116074453/http://timesonline.typepad.com/times_tokyo_weblog/2006/03/the_queen_and_t_1.html |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwasaki later regretted interviewing for Golden, having cited a breach of [[confidentiality]] and later sued and settled out of court with Golden for the parallelism between his book and her life. She later released her own [[autobiography]] titled ''Geisha of Gion'' (UK) or ''Geisha: A Life'' (USA) in 2002.

==Overview==
Born as Masako Tanaka, she left home at the age of five to begin studying traditional Japanese dance at the Iwasaki ''[[okiya]]'' (geisha house) in the [[Gion]] district of [[Kyoto]]. She was legally adopted by the okiya's owner, Madame Oima, and began using their family name of Iwasaki. She had been chosen as the house's ''atotori'', or heir. Iwasaki became a ''[[Maiko (geiko)|maiko]]'' (apprentice geiko) at age 15. She also received the name Mineko, as prescribed by a Japanese fortune-teller. By age 16, she had earned a reputation as Japan's most popular maiko and finally became a geiko on her 21st birthday.

According to her autobiography, Iwasaki worked herself to her physical and mental limits. She developed a near-fatal kidney condition but recovered. She entertained numerous celebrities and foreign dignitaries including [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. Iwasaki's fame also made her the subject of jealousy and gossip, and she was sometimes faced with sexual harassment and assault.

After the death of one of her most significant mentors in 1980, Iwasaki became increasingly frustrated with the tradition-bound world of the geiko, especially inadequacies in the education system. Iwasaki unexpectedly retired at the height of her career, at the age of 29. She hoped that her decision would shock Gion into reform; however, even after over 70 other high ranking geiko followed her into early  retirement, nothing was changed. In her autobiography, Iwasaki speculates that  the profession may be doomed if the industry fails to adapt to changing economic and social circumstance. She transitioned to a career in art after she married artist  Jin'ichirō Satō in 1982. Their  child, Kosuke, was born in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20134470,00.html Conflicting Memories]. [[People (magazine)|''People'']]. May 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Memoirs of a Geisha''==

Iwasaki was one of several geisha author [[Arthur Golden]] interviewed while researching his novel ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]''. According to Iwasaki, she agreed to speak with Golden on the condition that her involvement would be kept confidential, but Golden revealed her identity by mentioning her name in the book's acknowledgments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Calvin | last=Sims | coauthors= | title=A Geisha, a Successful Novel and a Lawsuit | date=2001-06-19 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DE1031F93AA25755C0A9679C8B63 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several national interviews. After ''Memoirs'' was published, Iwasaki received criticism and even death threats for violating the traditional geisha code of silence.

Iwasaki felt betrayed by Golden's use of information she considered confidential, as well as the way he twisted reality. She denounced ''Memoirs of a Geisha'' as being an inaccurate depiction of the life of a geisha. Iwasaki was particularly offended by the novel's portrayal of geiko engaging in ritualized prostitution. For example, in the novel the main character Sayuri's virginity (called ''[[mizuage]]'' in the novel) is auctioned off to the highest bidder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tamara | last=Weider | coauthors= | title=News and Features / Remaking a Memoir | date=2002-10-10 | publisher= | url =http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/documents/02473409.htm | work =The Phoenix | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwasaki stated that, not only did this never happen to her, but that no such custom ever existed in Gion.

Part of Iwasaki's displeasure with ''Memoirs'' may have been because the character Sayuri seems obviously modeled on Iwasaki, with many of the book's main characters and events having parallels in Iwasaki's life. These people and experiences are often portrayed negatively in ''Memoirs'', even when their real-life counterparts were positive for Iwasaki.

Iwasaki later gave public interviews citing that many established geiko criticized her interview with Arthur Golden, causing a rupture with the geisha tradition of secrecy to the outside world. Furthermore, Iwasaki has mentioned that she had lost some friends and relationships due to the scandal of her being known due to the book, along with certain inconsistencies and fallacies about [[Gion]] which were mentioned in ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]''.

'''Model robots''' is an area of modeling with its origin in the [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] [[genre]] of [[mecha]]. The majority of model [[robot]]s are produced by [[Bandai]] and are based on the ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' anime [[metaseries]]. This has given rise to the hobby's common name in Japan, ''[[Gunpla]]'' (or ''gan-pura'', a Japanese portmanteau of "Gundam" and "plastic model"). Though there are exceptions, the model robot genre is dominated by anime tie-ins, with anime series and movies frequently serving as merchandising platform.

==Construction==
Hard plastic joints generally exhibit greater friction than polyvinyl joints, and are similarly more durable than styrene joints. ABS joints, however, require greater precision in tooling to ensure easy assembly, and in some cases, they require screws and a small gap between parts.

Gundam kits are the most common and popular variety of mecha models and so exemplify the general characteristics of models in the genre. Gundam kits are typically oriented toward beginners, and most often feature simple construction, simple designs, and rugged construction&amp;mdash;less durable than a pre-assembled toy, but more durable than a true scale model. The result is that the majority of Gundam kits feature hands and other parts that favor poseability or easy assembly over accurate shape. They may also exhibit various draft-angle problems, and features like antennae that are oversized to prevent breakage. For the most part, other kit lines and other kit manufacturers in the genre follow suit, though there are exceptions.

==Scale==
Anime mecha subjects such as Gundam are most often portrayed as being between 15–20 meters tall, and so the kits are scaled in a manner that brings the subject to an economical and manageable size. For machines in this size range, scales of 1:100 and 1:144 are most common, with 1:60 being reserved for larger (and usually more expensive or elaborate) kits. For smaller subjects, scales such as 1:20, 1:35, and 1:72 are common. Bandai kits are commonly based upon fairly extensive and radical redesigns, rather than the original designs themselves. Some of this inconsistency representation may be due to the inherent difficulties in turning a 2-D cel-animated design into a 3-D design. Additionally, newer versions of the same mecha could be very different from an older version, due to better manufacturing technologies.

==Practice==
Gunpla is a major hobby in Japan, with entire magazines dedicated to variations on Bandai models. As mecha are fictional humanoid objects, there is considerable leeway for custom models and "kitbashes." A large amount of artistry goes into action poses and personalized variations on classic machines. There is also a market for custom resin kits which fill in gaps in the Bandai model line.

Gundam is not the only line of model robots. [[Eureka Seven]], [[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|Neon Genesis Evangelion]], [[Patlabor]], [[Aura Battler Dunbine]] and [[Heavy Metal L-Gaim]], to name a few, are all represented by Bandai model lines. Other manufacturers, such as [[Hasegawa Corporation|Hasegawa]], [[Wave]], and [[Kotobukiya]], have in recent years offered products from other series, such as [[Macross]], [[Votoms]], [[Five Star Stories]], [[Armored Core]], [[Virtual-On]], [[Zoids]], and [[Maschinen Krieger ZbV 3000|Maschinen Krieger]], with results rivaling Bandai's best products.

'''The Multiverse Software Foundation''' is a non-profit organization that was formed by volunteers in November 2011 to take over and manage the assets of the now-defunct [[Multiverse Network]] [http://gamasutra.com/view/news/39463/Cashstrapped_Firefly_MMO_developer_Multiverse_closes.php]. The Foundation maintains the Multiverse MMO Development Platform, which is a collection of open-source software used to create online games. The platform and assets are made available under the [[MIT License]]. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/multiverse3d]

==Mission statement==

''The Mission of The Multiverse Software Foundation is to shepherd the open source Multiverse Virtual World and MMOG Platform.''

''This includes the technology behind the system, as well as the community of users and developers.''
''We aim to advance the knowledge, usage, and availability of free open source software and tools.''

''We do not limit how the Multiverse platform can be used. We encourage casual usage as well as usage by for-profit businesses. The Multiverse Software Foundation functions as a non profit entity.''
''We believe this is the best way to advance the future of virtual worlds and MMOG platforms.''

== Software Releases ==

Since acquiring the software and media assets of the Multiverse Network, the Multiverse Software Foundation has released new versions of the client [http://sourceforge.net/projects/multiverse3d/files/], tools, and server packages.

== Technology ==
Multiverse client technology is based on the Axiom 3D Rendering Engine which is a C# based fork of the Ogre3D rendering engine.&lt;ref&gt;http://axiom3d.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt; The client can be scripted and customized in Python. The server technology is based on Java and may be customized and modified in either Java or Python. The database uses MySql and JDBC. Assets in Collada and Ogre 3D format may be imported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multiversemmo.com/wiki/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original Multiverse Network ==
The original Multiverse Network was shut down following an inability to achieve a profitable business model. Several online and promotional games were planned or in development by Multiverse including games based on Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and James Cameron's Avatar.&lt;ref&gt;http://gamasutra.com/view/news/39463/Cashstrapped_Firefly_MMO_developer_Multiverse_closes.php#.UEUSAqCO2gY&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.industrygamers.com/news/multiverse-network-gets-shut-down/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120015921/http://www.industrygamers.com/news/multiverse-network-gets-shut-down/ |archivedate=2012-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sggaminginfo.com/2011/06/darkcryos-craig-redl-talks-firefly-universe/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029104814/http://www.sggaminginfo.com/2011/06/darkcryos-craig-redl-talks-firefly-universe/ |archivedate=2012-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also independent developers using the original Multiverse engine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=53650&amp;start=25&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent empirical research suggests that 3 to 5% of the population are affected by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10687919/Dont-like-music-Scientists-explain-why.html|title=Musical anhedonia: why some people just don't like music|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable finding relevant to this phenomenon was borne out of a scientific study conducted in 2014, which revealed that while those exhibiting musical anhedonia do not have a problem comprehending music, they simply fail to experience or exhibit any material form of positive emotional response from listening to it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/musical-anhedonia_us_586e717ce4b02b5f85875c21|title=Not Liking Music Is An Actual Neurological Condition|last=Gregoire|first=Carolyn|date=2017-01-06|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have utilized [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans to study patients via scanning their brains while the patients are being presented with the auditory stimulus of musical sounds. Patients were given other psychological and emotional perception-oriented tests that were related to the notion of money during the MRI procedure to effectively control the experiment for music or to isolate the effect or effects of the independent variable of music (i.e., in other words, to make sure they only showed no emotion while listening to music). The studies revealed that, relative to the average person, individuals whom are shown to exhibit this condition tend to have a significantly lesser degree of a connection in their brain between their [[auditory processing]] and [[reward center]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mas-Herrero|first=Ernest|last2=Zatorre|first2=Robert J.|last3=Rodriguez-Fornells|first3=Antoni|last4=Marco-Pallarés|first4=Josep|date=2014-03-17|title=Dissociation between Musical and Monetary Reward Responses in Specific Musical Anhedonia|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(14)00133-X|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=24|issue=6|pages=699–704|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.01.068|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt; MRI scans also showed that people with this condition have relatively little connection between the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[auditory processing]] compared to the average person. In fact, it was also empirically deduced that individuals who are shown to enjoy listening to music have a higher connection in this area of the brain than those who are found to have the condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Social stigma==
The majority of the world's population enjoys listening to music.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} According to some, for this reason, music can be considered to be a universal language. Individuals who suffer from musical anhedonia tend to find it challenging for themselves to understand why it is that they do not gain pleasure from listening to music. The core societal benefits that have emerged out of the new empirical research on the phenomenon are two-fold: it has helped people with this condition to better understand why they have it and it has served to educate the rest of the population that it is a real and legitimate condition that significantly impacts the lives of many around the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''NHS Direct''' was the health advice and information service provided by the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS), established in March 1998. The nurse-led telephone information service provided residents and visitors in [[England]] with healthcare advice [[24/7|24 hours a day]], every day of the year through telephone contact on the national non-geographic 0845 46 47 number.&lt;ref name="wha"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/nhs-direct |title=What is NHS Direct? |first=Joanne |last=Shaw |work=politics.co.uk |year=2012 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2014-04-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421051155/http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/nhs-direct }}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme also provided a web based symptom checkers on the NHS Direct website and via mobile, both as apps for [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smart phones and a mobile website.

It was discontinued on 31 March 2014 and replaced by [[NHS 111]].&lt;ref name="nhsWhat"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''NHS Direct'' |title=What is NHS Direct? |url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/About/WhatIsNHSDirect |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2010-07-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710183704/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/About/WhatIsNHSDirect }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the National Health Service, NHS Direct services were free, although the 0845 number was usually chargeable as a non-geographic number. Some landline providers allowed 0845 calls within "inclusive" minutes.

Users of the service, through whichever channel, were asked questions about their symptoms or problem.  Common problems were often given simple self care advice, which they could follow, thereby avoiding an expensive visit to a health care professional.  More complex problems were assessed by a nurse and could then be given treatment advice or referred on to another service within the NHS.

As well as these core services, NHS Direct provided a number of commissioned services throughout the NHS, such as specialised support for patients with long term conditions, access to [[General practitioner|GP]] and dental healthcare out of hours, and a professional response system for times of public health anxiety.

NHS Direct only provided its service for residents and visitors in England, and there are corresponding public services covering [[Scotland]] ([[NHS 24]]) and [[Wales]] ([[NHS Direct Wales]]). [[Northern Ireland]] does not have such a service.

==Health and symptomatic advice==
NHS Direct's core service was the provision of health advice to the public through the national telephone service or through digital channels including the website.

===Telephone service===
In England and Wales, the NHS Direct telephone service was available on '''0845 46 47''' and was run by a specially trained team of information handlers and healthcare professionals, including nurses and dental nurses. The service was equipped to deal with a huge range of health enquiries, from symptomatic queries that require assessment and treatment, to requests for local healthcare services and healthy living advice.

Every person that called NHS Direct feeling unwell was assessed to establish the severity of their symptoms, so as to re-route any urgent or life-threatening situations to the [[Emergency medical services|emergency services]] as quickly as possible.

Other symptomatic callers were able to speak to a nurse practitioner, who asked about their condition in order to recommend the best course of action. This could be giving advice about treating the problem at home, suggesting a visit to a pharmacist, or advising an appointment with their [[General practitioner|GP]], which, if in the out of hours period (when the [[General practitioner|GP]] surgeries are closed), could possibly be arranged over the phone.

As many callers were advised to look after their symptoms at home without seeing their [[General practitioner|GP]], the NHS Direct telephone service reduced the demand on [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] resources and helped to avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor, dentist and [[Emergency department|accident and emergency department]].

The NHS Direct telephone service also provided a confidential interpreter service in many different languages, which could be accessed by stating the language required when the call was answered. For those who are deaf or hard of hearing, there was a textphone service available on '''0845 606 4647'''.

===Website===
The NHS Direct website had a variety of symptom checkers, based on the same system used on the telephone service and could either give self care advice or direct a user to another NHS service. For more complex queries, the symptom checkers allowed the user to receive a call back from a nurse or to take part in a webchat for further information and help.

All NHS Direct health advice and information on the website passed through a rigorous clinical check by medical professionals before it was published.&lt;ref name="nhscsp"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''NHS Direct'' |url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/article.aspx?SectionId=5&amp;Name=FreedomOfInformationDocuments#policiesandproceduresrelatingtotheconductofbusinessandtheprovisionofnhsdirectservices |title=Clinical Supervision Policy |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2009-03-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306075721/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/article.aspx?SectionId=5&amp;Name=FreedomOfInformationDocuments#policiesandproceduresrelatingtotheconductofbusinessandtheprovisionofnhsdirectservices }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-urgent health queries could be submitted to the NHS Direct online enquiry service and the website also offered a confidential webchat service for those needing advice about unprotected sex or emergency contraception.

===Mobile services===
NHS Direct offered its full range of symptom checkers optimised for mobile devices on its [https://web.archive.org/web/20110609050516/http://mobile.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/ mobile website] and also launched stand alone 'apps' for [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smart phones, both available in the normal app stores.&lt;ref name="nhsApp"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''NHS Direct'' |title=NHS Direct mobile app |url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/en/About/MobileApps |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2011-06-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606043042/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/en/About/MobileApps }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plint40194"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''Pocket Lint'' |title=App of the day:NHS Direct |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/40194/nhs-direct-android-app-of-the-day |deadurl=no |archivedate=2011-05-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530000755/http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/40194/nhs-direct-android-app-of-the-day }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other services==

===Digital television channel===
NHS Direct provided an interactive TV service via [[Sky Active|Sky Interactive]] until 31 March 2009, when the service was closed.&lt;ref name="nhsTV"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''NHS Direct'' |url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/article.aspx?name=DigitalTV |title=Digital TV | deadurl=yes |archivedate=2009-03-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322075904/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/article.aspx?name=DigitalTV }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] service, on channel 100 is now hosted by [http://www.nhs.uk/ NHS Choices].&lt;ref name="freeviewNHS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freeview.co.uk/freeview/Channels/Interactive/NHS-Choices |title=Home Channels Interactive NHS Choices |publisher=''Freeview'' |date= |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2009-07-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705145851/http://www.freeview.co.uk/freeview/Channels/Interactive/NHS-Choices }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital television service contained condensed versions of many of the most common and popular health encyclopaedia topics and common health questions.

===Commissioned services===
Although it is not well known, NHS Direct supplies a multitude of additional commissioned services within the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]].

NHS Direct supported many local health authorities in England, including [[NHS primary care trust|Primary Care Trusts]] (PCTs), helping them to deliver high quality healthcare to people in each region.

These services ranged from dedicated projects in particular areas, such as the local telephone helpline set up for Sandwell [[NHS primary care trust|PCT]] after a dental health scare, to schemes that were developed nationwide. These include a telephone-based pre and post operative assessment for patients having surgery, and allocating care managers to give regular coaching and advice to those with long term conditions, such as [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].

==History and background==
NHS Direct was launched in 1998 after the government identified a need for a telephone health advice line staffed by nurses as part of its plans to modernise the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]].&lt;ref name="DH_4008959"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''Department of Health'' |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4008959 |title=The New NHS: Modern, Dependable }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of NHS Direct, as stated by the government in the NHS White Paper, ''The New NHS'', was "to provide people at home with easier and faster advice and information about health, illness, and the NHS, so that they are better able to care for themselves and their families".&lt;ref name="nhsdirect1"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''NHS Direct'' |url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/article.aspx?name=HistoryOfNHSDirect |title=History of NHS Direct |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2008-12-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217040304/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/article.aspx?name=HistoryOfNHSDirect }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHS Direct telephone service began taking calls in three contact centres in Lancashire, Northumbria and Milton Keynes in March 1998.&lt;ref name="DH_4006050"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''Department of Health'' |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4006050 |title=Evaluation of NHS Direct first wave sites first interim report to the Department of Health |deadurl=no |archivedate=2007-08-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811075447/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4006050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These original sites were set up as pilots but soon proved successful, reaching over 1 million people and earning highly positive feedback. Additional waves of pilots were established in contact centres around England until the whole country was covered by the NHS Direct telephone service in 2000.&lt;ref name="nhsdirect1"/&gt;

NHS Direct added a website to its services at the end of 1999, allowing users to find clinically accurate health advice and information anonymously. Since its creation, the NHS Direct website was steadily improved and developed, attracting more users. By 2008, there were over 1.5 million visitors to the website every month.&lt;ref name="nhsdirect1"/&gt; NHS Direct's services continued to expand and improve. It had been said that this has made the organisation "the largest and most successful healthcare provider of its kind, anywhere in the world".&lt;ref name="DH_4920815"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''Department of Health'' |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/Browsable/DH_4920815 |title=Developing NHS Direct: Strategy Document for the next three years" (Foreword) |deadurl=no |archivedate=2012-03-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301035437/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/Browsable/DH_4920815 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that each call made to NHS Direct cost £25 to answer - an earlier official report had put the total at £16.&lt;ref name="telegraph3253245"&gt;{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Devlin |date=2008-10-24 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3253245/Every-call-to-NHS-Direct-costs-25.html |title=Every call to NHS Direct costs £25 |work=The Telegraph |deadurl=no |archivedate=2009-09-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918195148/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3253245/Every-call-to-NHS-Direct-costs-25.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, NHS Direct became an NHS Trust, giving it the opportunity to apply for foundation trust status.&lt;ref name="wha"/&gt;

In August 2010, the BBC reported that David Cameron's coalition government was planning to scrap the NHS Direct 0845 46 47 helpline telephone service in favour of the cheaper [[NHS 111 (England)|NHS 111]] number.  This intention was set out in the white paper, but was portrayed in the media as a 'leak' by the Conservative Health Secretary [[Andrew Lansley]].&lt;ref name="bbc11120853"&gt;{{cite news |work=BBC News |date=2010-08-28 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11120853 |title=Government confirms plan to scrap NHS Direct helpline |deadurl=no |archivedate=2010-08-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828190855/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11120853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was shut down on 26 March 2014.&lt;ref name="holding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/ |title=NHS Direct holding page |publisher=''NHS Direct'' |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2014-03-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330223828/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="close"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/wellbeing/540408/nhs-direct-closed-for-business |title=NHS Direct: closed for business |work=Good to Know |publisher=IPC Media Women's Network |date=2014-03-28 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2014-04-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426222123/http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/wellbeing/540408/nhs-direct-closed-for-business }}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the website was archived a few weeks before the official closedown.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/ |title=Archive Copy of NHS Direct Website |work=National Archives |date=2014-02-20 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2014-02-20 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140220132333/http:/www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition of NHS Direct helpline (England)==
The Department of Health confirmed that NHS Direct's telephone number was to be phased out in favour of the new non-emergency [[NHS 111 (England)|NHS 111]] number, following three pilots in the North East, East Midlands and East of England. NHS 111 is intended to work in an integrated way with local GPs, out-of-hours services, ambulance services and hospitals, for the benefit of patients and to help the NHS become more efficient. NHS Direct was intended to have an ongoing role, along with other providers, in helping to deliver the NHS 111 Service and, in the interim, continued providing local and national telephone and web-based services on behalf of its commissioners. The Labour party, which founded NHS Direct, voiced its opposition to the proposal, although it had promised to introduce the new 111 hotline nationally in its election manifesto.&lt;ref name="sky111"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Medical-Helpline-NHS-Direct-Is-To-Be-Axed-And-Replaced-By-The-New-111-Service/Article/201008415708224 |title=Medical Helpline NHS Direct is to be axed |work=Sky News |date=2010-08-28 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2010-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831102303/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Medical-Helpline-NHS-Direct-Is-To-Be-Axed-And-Replaced-By-The-New-111-Service/Article/201008415708224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="labour2010"&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/manifesto/a-personal-nhs |title=World leading healthcare: a patient-centred NHS|publisher=Labour Party |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2010-04-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414145806/http://www.labour.org.uk/manifesto/a-personal-nhs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==

It was announced in October 2013 that NHS Direct would be closed down in 2014.&lt;ref name="bbc24651402"&gt;{{cite news |title=NHS Direct to close down next year |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24651402 |work=BBC News |date=2013-10-24 |deadurl=no |archivedate=2013-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024175441/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24651402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the organisation became entangled in and failed to deliver correctly a number of contracts to deliver [[NHS 111]].

'''News Xchange''' is an annual conference for the international broadcast news industry. The event is run on a not-for-profit basis and is underwritten by Eurovision, which runs the global [[Eurovision Network]] as the operations department of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The News Xchange - Nordvision|url = http://www.nordvision.org/aktuelt/vis_nyhed/News_Xchange_2008/3/|accessdate = 2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year the event lasts for two days and is sponsored by a range of organizations involved in news broadcasting around the world.

== News Xchange purpose ==
The main purpose of the event is the discussion of issues currently affecting broadcast journalists and editors around the world. News Xchange attracts contributions from prominent figures from the broadcast news industry as well as politicians, opinion formers and other important individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = UNDERCOVER JOURNALISM AND HIDDEN CAMERAS: THE NEW GADGETS AND THE NEW EDITORIAL CHALLENGES - Donal Macintyre |url = http://macintyre.com/content/view/428/105/%3Cbr%20/%3E|accessdate = 2008-08-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = News Xchange, A good conference - Richard Sambrook |url = http://sambrook.typepad.com/sacredfacts/2006/11/newsxchange.html|accessdate = 2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = News Xchange: a gem of a conference - Mike Mullane |url = http://multimediameetsradio.typepad.com/ebu/2006/11/no_wooden_spoon.html|accessdate = 2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = News Xchange: New media; better democracy? - Jemima Kiss |url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2006/11/news_xchange_does_social_media.html|accessdate = 2008-08-06 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction from News Exchanges ==
The News Xchange conference (which has no 'E' at the start of Xchange) is distinct from Eurovision News Exchanges (with an 'E'); though the two are sometimes confused. Daily News Exchanges are organized by Eurovision on behalf of members of the European Broadcasting Union. News Xchange conference has no direct connection with these Exchanges and is open to all organizations and individuals involved in broadcast news.

'''Nick Jr. India''' is a channel devoted to toddlers and a part of the [[Nickelodeon India]] franchise.

==History==
The channel was a block on [[Nick India]] then [[Viacom 18]] launched it as a separate channel in fall of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.televisionpost.com/television/viacom18-launches-nick-jr-to-enter-preschool-segment-in-india/|title=Viacom18 launches Nick Jr. to enter preschool segment in India {{!}} TelevisionPost.com|website=www.televisionpost.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viacom 18 launched [[TeenNick India|Teen Nick]] and Nick Jr. as a single channel on 21 November 2012. Nick Jr. airs in the daytime while Teen Nick airs at night. However Teen Nick has shut down since 1 February 2017, which made Nick Jr. a 24-hour channel.

'''Pierre Jaubert''' aka '''Pierre Berjot''' (1929–August 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://funku.fr/2017/disparition-du-producteur-pierre-jaubert/ |title=Disparition du producteur Pierre Jaubert |website=Funk-U |language=fr-FR |access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a record company executive and a record producer. He has produced recordings for artists such as [[John Lee Hooker]], Krispie And Company, The [[Lafayette Afro Rock Band ]], [[Mal Waldron]], [[Leroy Gomez]], [[Chantal Curtis]], Beckie Bell and [[Richard Sanderson]]. According to the French Wikipedia he died on August 8, 2017.

==Career==
===1960s===
As of early 1967, he was the international manager for the French company [[Musicdisc]] which was the first French company to push [[Stereo-Pak|4-track cartridges]]. In 1967, he was announcing that his company was going to sell 4-track cartridges rather than [[8-track tape|8-tracks]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'', January 21, 1967 - [https://books.google.com/books?id=JikEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Pierre+Berjot%22Musicdisc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfh6D1r_fWAhUFE5QKHe2bDu8Q6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pierre%20Berjot%22Musicdisc&amp;f=false Page 12 INTERNATIONAL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'', June 3, 1967 - [https://books.google.com/books?id=4ScEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA56&amp;dq=%22Pierre+Berjot%22Musicdisc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC2ofvhvXWAhXLoJQKHdnNDAQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pierre%20Berjot%22Musicdisc&amp;f=false Page 56 Musicdisc Becomes First French Firm to Go 4-Track]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he had said in an article that the company had switched to 8-tracks and they were having trouble satisfying the demand for them.&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'', November 16, 1968 - [https://books.google.com/books?id=r0UEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Pierre+Berjot%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKw7GwrffWAhVHJ5QKHQKKA-cQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pierre%20Berjot%22&amp;f=false Page 1 French Swing to 8-Track]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Around 1969/1970, Jaubert produced a number of recordings for [[John Lee Hooker]] which included "Baby Don't Do Me Wrong", "Call It The Night" and "Going Home".&lt;ref&gt;Swedishcharts.com - [http://swedishcharts.com/showperson.asp?name=Pierre+Jaubert PIERRE JAUBERT]&lt;/ref&gt; 
===1970s===
He was still heading the international department for Musicdisc in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'', May 1, 11971 - [https://books.google.com/books?id=-wgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22Pierre+Berjot%22Musicdisc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfh6D1r_fWAhUFE5QKHe2bDu8Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pierre%20Berjot%22Musicdisc&amp;f=false Page f-11 Musicdisc Europe, The First Independent French Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, he produced the album ''Candy Girl'' for [[Mal Waldron]]. The album never saw a proper release and only about 50 copies were pressed. Decades later in 2016, a copy of the LP would sell for US $1215.&lt;ref&gt;Libreville Records - [http://www.librevillerecords.com/product/mal-waldron-candy-girl Mal Waldron - Candy Girl - Limited Edition (B&amp;W Cover)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popsike - [https://www.popsike.com/Mal-Waldron-Candy-girl-CALUMET-Lafayette-Afro-Rock-Band-M-VERY-RARE-LISTEN/311718767153.html #Mal Waldron- Candy girl CALUMET Lafayette Afro Rock Band]&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-released as a limited edition of 500 on Libreville Records in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs - [https://www.discogs.com/Mal-Waldron-Candy-Girl/release/10050995 Mal Waldron  – Candy Girl]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two acts he discovered in the 1970s were the [[Lafayette Afro Rock Band]] and [[Chantal Curtis]].&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Pepperell - [http://martynpepperell.tumblr.com/post/4040520905/the-lafayette-afro-rock-band-interview THE LAFAYETTE AFRO-ROCK BAND INTERVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Funkybeat 70-80 - [https://www.funky-beat.net/87-chantal-curtis.html Chantal Sitruk dite CHANTAL CURTIS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Funk★U'', Publié le 8 août 2017 - [http://www.funku.fr/2017/disparition-du-producteur-pierre-jaubert/ Disparition du producteur Pierre Jaubert, Propos recueillis par Christophe Geudin.

He ended up using  the Lafayette Afro Rock Band as his house session band at his Parisound studio. He spotted them performing at Barbès, a Paris district which had many North African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Pepperell - [http://martynpepperell.tumblr.com/post/4040520905/the-lafayette-afro-rock-band-interview THE LAFAYETTE AFRO-ROCK BAND INTERVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[AllMusic]] - [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lafayette-afro-rock-band-mn0000104314/biography Lafayette Afro Rock Band, Artist Biography by Jason Ankeny]&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered Chantal Curtis one day in the 1970s, overhearing her talking to a friend on a Paris street.

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Antigua and Barbuda}}
[[Sex trafficking]] is a problem in [[Antigua and Barbuda]].&lt;ref name="sextour"&gt;{{cite web|title=16 Caribbean Nations Where Sex Trafficking Remains A Problem {{!}} News Americas Now:Caribbean and Latin America Daily News|url=http://www.newsamericasnow.com/16-caribbean-nations-where-sex-trafficking-remains-a-problem/|website=News Americas Now:|accessdate=30 December 2017|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country is a destination and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Documented and undocumented immigrants from the Caribbean region, notably from [[Jamaica]], [[Guyana]], [[Haiti]], and the [[Dominican Republic]], as well as from [[Southeast Asia]], are most vulnerable to trafficking. Sex trafficking has been reported in bars, taverns, and brothels. Recruitment of victims has often involved the promise of opportunities, such as a job offer to work as a dancer in a club. There are anecdotal reports of children subjected to sex trafficking, including by parents and caregivers. There have been concerns about trafficking-related complicity by police officers.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antigua and Barbuda 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271133.htm|website=U.S. Department of State}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trafficking in Persons (Prevention) Act, 2010, which was amended in 2015 to vest jurisdiction for trafficking cases to the High Court of Justice, prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes punishments of 20 to 30 years imprisonment and fines of 400,000 to 600,000 Eastern Caribbean dollars. Experts noted the prosecutor’s office had limited staff and resources and were concerned the police were not undertaking proactive raids to uncover sex trafficking cases.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; Between 2010 and 2015, a total of 43 women were reported to the Directorate of Gender Affairs as being trafficked.&lt;ref name="cedaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Combined fourth to seventh periodic reports submitted by Antigua and Barbuda under article 18 of the Convention|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/ATG/CEDAW_C_ATG_4-7_5897_E.pdf|website=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Antigua and Barbuda as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

[[Child prostitution]] is a problem in the Gambia.

The Gambia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on 3 August 1990, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in  September 2000, which mandates the government to protect children from sexual child abuse.  The  main  legislation  is  the  Tourism  Offences  Act,  2003,  which  is  describes  a  child  as  anyone under  eighteen,  even though  the  legal  age  of  consent  is  sixteen  years.

Within The Gambia, girls and, to a lesser extent, boys are subjected to sex trafficking. Children from West African countries, mainly Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Benin. are recruited for commercial sexual exploitation in The Gambia. The majority of these victims are subjected to sexual exploitation by child sex tourists, primarily from Britain, Germany, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Canada.  In recent years, sex traffickers are increasingly hosting child sex tourists in private residences outside the commercial tourist areas of Banjul, making the crime harder for law enforcement to detect. Traffickers have allegedly exploited Sierra Leonean boys and girls as “cultural dancers” in The Gambia. Observers believe organised sex trafficking networks use European and Gambian travel agencies to promote child sex tourism.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gambia 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271191.htm|publisher=US Department of State Office to Monitor and  Combat Trafficking in Persons|accessdate=17 December 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==

The Gambia is a [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]] country for [[Human trafficking]] according to the US Department of State.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gambia, The 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282658.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gambian 2007 Trafficking Act prohibits trafficking and those convicted can be sentenced to prison for up to 50 years.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The Gambia is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Within The Gambia, women, girls, and—to a lesser extent—boys are subjected to sex trafficking. Women and children from West African countries—mainly Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Benin—are recruited for commercial sexual exploitation in The Gambia.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

A '''psychic vampire''' is a mythological creature said to feed off the "[[Energy (esotericism)|life force]]" of other living creatures.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/23/AR2008112302158.html A Vampire's Life?

==Psychic energy==
Terms used to describe the substance or essence that psychic vampires take or receive from others include: ''energy'',&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; ''[[qi]]'' (or ''ch'i''), ''life force'', ''[[prana]]'',&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; and ''vitality''.  There is no scientific or medical evidence supporting the existence of the bodily or psychic energy they allegedly drain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|title=Vampires Among Us: From Bats to Psychics|url=http://www.livescience.com/6009-vampires-bats-psychics.html|work=Live Science|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotional vampires==
American author Albert Bernstein uses the phrase "emotional vampire" for people with various [[personality disorder]]s who are often considered to drain [[emotion]]al energy from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Energy vampires==
The term "energy vampire" is also used metaphorically to refer to people whose influence leaves a person feeling exhausted, unfocused, and depressed, without ascribing the phenomenon to psychic interference.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/personal/03/11/o.energy.vampires/index.html Watch out for energy vampires], by Dr. Judith Orloff, ''[[CNN]]'', March 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/09/23/tem_energy23.html|title='Energy Addict' puts positive spin on life with nutrition and exercise|last=O'Farrell|first=Peggy|date=23 September 2004|work=Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dion Fortune]] wrote of psychic parasitism in relation to vampirism as early as 1930 in her book, ''Psychic Self-Defense''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Psychic self-defense |last=Fortune |first=Dion |year=2001|origyear=1930 |publisher=Samuel Weiser |isbn=978-1-57863-150-6 |oclc=44926949 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles and Collins, Carr; The Story of Dion Fortune, Thoth Books, 1998, {{ISBN|1-870450-33-7}}, p150,&lt;/ref&gt; Fortune considered psychic vampirism a combination of [[psychic]] and [[Psychology|psychological]] pathology, and distinguished between what she considered to be true psychic vampirism and mental conditions that produce similar symptoms. For the latter, she named [[folie à deux]] and similar phenomena.

The term "psychic vampire" was popularized in the 1960s by [[Anton LaVey]] and his [[Church of Satan]]. LaVey wrote on the topic in his book, ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', and claimed to have coined the term.&lt;ref name=lavey&gt;{{cite journal|first=Eugene|last=Robinson|title=Anton LaVey|journal=Birth of Tragedy|date=November 1986|url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/BOT.html|accessdate=2007-03-31|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaVey used ''psychic vampire'' to mean a spiritually or emotionally weak person who drains vital energy from other people. [[Adam Parfrey]] likewise attributed the term to LaVey in an introduction to ''[[The Devil's Notebook]]''.&lt;ref name=Davison1997&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Davison |first1=Carol Margaret |year=1997 |title=Bram Stoker's Dracula: sucking through the century, 1897–1997 |first2=Paul |last2=Simpson-Housley |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd. |isbn=978-1-55002-279-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brj7yfaBkPAC |page=310 |quote=LaVey defines psychic vampires as "individuals who drain others of their vital energy... They fill no useful purpose in our lives, and are neither love objects nor true friends. |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "energy vampire" and "psychic vampire" have been used as synonyms in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union as part of an occult revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeNio Stephens|first=Holly|editor=Glatzer Rosenthal, Bernice|title=The Occult in Russian and Soviet Culture|chapter=The Occult in Russia Today|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=468|isbn=0-8014-8331-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kumg5iYYkWkC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vampire subculture===
Sociologists such as Mark Benecke&lt;ref&gt;Mark Benecke and Aleksandra Blak, 'Vampire Youth Subculture in New York City', presented as a conference paper at the Second World Dracula Congress (Poiana Brasov, Romania: 24–28 May 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and A. Asbjorn Jon.&lt;ref name=australianfolklore&gt;A. Asbjorn Jon, 'The Psychic Vampire and Vampyre Subculture', in ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283273380_The_Psychic_Vampire_and_Vampyre_Subculture Australian Folklore: A Yearly Journal of Folklore Studies]'', 12 (2002), pp. 143–148 (p.145) {{ISBN|1-86389-831-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; have identified a subculture of people who present themselves as vampires.  Jon has noted that enthusiasts of the [[vampire subculture]] emulate traditional psychic vampires in that they describe 'prey[ing] upon life-force or 'pranic' energy'.&lt;ref name=australianfolklore/&gt;

==Sexual vampires==
A related mythological creature is a sexual vampire, which is supposed to feed off sexual energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Frost|1989|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual vampires include [[succubi]] or [[incubi]].

==In popular culture==
Psychic vampires are featured in the 1985 science fiction film ''[[Lifeforce (film)|Lifeforce]]''.

Singer/songwriter [[Tristen Gaspadarek]] tells of her experiences with a psychic vampire in the song ''Psychic Vampire'' on her 2017 album ''Sneaker Waves''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/07/tristen-psychic-vampire2.html |title=Tristen - Psychic Vampire |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=July 25, 2017 |website=www.pastemagazine.com |publisher=Paste Magazine |access-date=October 19, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the TV show, "[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (TV series)|Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]", the characters known as the Rowdy Three are called "Psychic Vampires" because they feed on Psychic energy. The members are Martin, Gripps, Cross, Vogel, Amanda, and the Beast. There are more than three, and they are "very much aware" of the fact. Notably, the Rowdy 3 is composed of four people, and later five, and then six at the end of the show, and are some of the people studied by the government organization tracking Dirk. They were originally classified as vampires, as they live by eating people's emotional energy.

'''''Quan họ''''' ({{IPA-vi|kwaːn hɔ̂ˀ|lang}}) singing is a [[Music of Vietnam|Vietnamese]] [[folk music]] style characterized both by its [[antiphon]]al nature, with alternating groups of female and male singers issuing musical challenges and responses, and by the fact that most of the songs in the repertoire deal with topics of love and sentimentality as experienced by young adults.&lt;ref name=Le2002&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Quan Họ Singing in Ritual-festivals in Bắc Ninh Region (Vietnam) 
 | url = http://home.vicnet.net.au/~aaf/quanho.htm
 | accessdate = 2007-07-23
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quan ho is recognised as the Intangible Cultural Heritage by the [[UNESCO]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=00183 UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention :]&lt;/ref&gt;

The quan họ style originated in what is now [[Bắc Ninh Province]] and was first recorded in the 13th century, and has traditionally been associated with the spring festivals that follow the celebration of [[Tết]] (the Vietnamese New Year). Historically, the singing began on the evening before the festival, but today it is much more common for the singing to occur on the main day of the festival. In general, an initial "challenge phrase" (''câu ra'') from the known body of songs is sung by a pair of female singers, following which a pair of male singers will respond by selecting and singing a "matching phrase" (''câu đối''), which must repeat the melody of the challenge phrase. Once they are finished, the order is reversed, and the men will issue their own challenge phrase with a different melody. While in the past the singing was unaccompanied, it is common today for the singers to be accompanied by instruments, whether traditional Vietnamese instruments or modern ones such as electric keyboards.&lt;ref name=Le2002/&gt;

There are a huge number of ''quan họ'' melodies, with thousands of different songs having been recorded and written down in score form. A simpler variant of response song, allowing spoken responses and sung by boys and girls at village festivals is [[trống quân]] singing.

'''Strand Lighting''' is an international theatre and television lighting company founded in 1914 in  [[London|London's]] [[West End of London|West End]] that supplies lighting fixtures and controls for the entertainment industry. Strand's products have been used on countless theatre productions and TV shows worldwide.

==History==
Strand Electric, as it was originally named, was created in 1914. Arthur Earnshaw and Phillip Sheridan were both London theatre electricians when they set up their company.

In 1968, Strand Lighting was purchased by the famous [[Rank Organisation|Rank]] film Corporation and thus became Rank Strand.

In 1969, Rank took over Century Lighting (Started in New York in 1929) which became Strand Century in the US.

In 1976, Rank acquired Stagesound Ltd from Theatre Progects and created Rank Strand Sound.

In 1986 Rank Strand bought Quartzcolor, an Italian-based manufacturer of TV &amp; Film Lighting. 
 
In 1990 Strand Lighting became the first company (and only North American company) to achieve ISO9000 Quality certification.

Strand was eventually bought from Rank by a venture capitalist group in the late 1990s.

On 11 July 2006 the [[Genlyte Group]], a US company, announced their acquisition of Strand Lighting.  Genlyte has since been acquired by [[Royal Philips Lighting]] 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

  | accessdate = 2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Strand Lighting is still run as a separate, independent company within Royal Philips Lighting, and continues as a leading name in stage, television, motion picture, and architectural lighting and services.

According to Jan Theysen of King Art Games, ''The Book of Unwritten Tales 2'' was the company's most successful game, with sales "in the mid six-digit range" by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180614071728/https://www.gamereactor.de/Artikel/118144/Theysen+Das+deutsche+AdventurePublikum+ist+anspruchsvoller/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Book of Unwritten Tales 2'' received positive reviews from critics. The game has a [[Metacritic]] score of 80/100.&lt;ref name="Metacritic" /&gt; [[Game Revolution]] commented: "Is ''The Book of Unwritten Tales 2'' worth getting? Definitely! Although it doesn't add much innovation to the series, this game offers a more complex and fine-tuned adventure than its predecessor."&lt;ref name="Game Revolution 2015-02-17"/&gt; ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'': "If you love point and click adventures, ''The Book of Unwritten Tales 2'' is everything you could possibly want and more. With stunning (and clever) graphics, a fully orchestrated soundtrack and top-notch voice acting, its production values are second to none, and it has writing chops to match."&lt;ref name="Hardcore Gamer 2015-02-23"/&gt; ''[[PC World]]'' called the puzzle design excellent but the graphics and audio occasionally spotty.&lt;ref name="PC World 2015-02-20"/&gt; It stated: "''The Book of Unwritten Tales 2'' is a reminder that while [[Telltale Games|Telltale]] may have usurped the adventure genre, great traditional point-and-clicks can still be made."&lt;ref name="PC World 2015-02-20"/&gt;

Console editions received mixed reviews, though the Xbox One version provided noticeably better scores than the PlayStation 4 despite similar complaints for each console.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Criticism was brought to the controls on the console ports.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

'''''The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole''''' is a [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] novel by American writer [[Stephen King]]. As part of [[The Dark Tower (series)|''The Dark Tower'' series]], it is the eighth novel, but it is set chronologically between volumes [[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|four]] and [[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|five]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''For longtime readers, this book should be shelved between ''Wizard and Glass'' and ''Wolves of the Calla'', which makes it, I suppose, ''Dark Tower 4.5''.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{{small|- Stephen King - The Wind Through the Keyhole: Foreword}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) First mentioned by King in 2009, after the controversial ending of the [[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|seventh novel]] in 2004, this new episode was announced on the author's official site on March 10, 2011. 

==Background information==
In an interview in March 2009, King stated, describing an idea for a new short story he recently had: "And then I thought, 'Well, why don't I find three more like this and do a book that would be almost like modern fairy tales?' Then this thing started to add on bits and pieces so I guess it will be a novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whosnews.usaweekend.com/2009/03/stephen-king-not-done-with-his-dark-tower-series|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715151045/http://whosnews.usaweekend.com/2009/03/stephen-king-not-done-with-his-dark-tower-series|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 15, 2012|title=Stephen King not done with his 'Dark Tower' series|publisher=[[USA Weekend]]|date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While promoting his novel ''[[Under the Dome (novel)|Under the Dome]]'', King confirmed this during his TimesTalk event at The TimesCenter in [[New York City]] on November, 2009, and the next day King's official site posted the information that its tentative title was ''The Wind Through the Keyhole''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Stephen. [http://www.stephenking.com/news.html "The Wind Through The Keyhole - Letter from Stephen"], stephenking.com, March 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2009, Stephen King posted a poll on his website, asking visitors to vote for which book he should write next and it was announced at the start of 2010 that ''The Wind Through the Keyhole'' had received most votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephenking.com/forums/showthread.php/16392-Doctor-Sleep-wins "Doctor Sleep wins?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507013114/http://www.stephenking.com/forums/showthread.php/16392-Doctor-Sleep-wins |date=2012-05-07 }}, stephenking.com, January 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant, Publisher, Inc.]] in February 2012 and in a mass market edition by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secure.grantbooks.com/z-sk-dt-twttk.html "Special Announcement"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121209211842/https://secure.grantbooks.com/z-sk-dt-twttk.html |date=2012-12-09 }}. Donald M. Grant. May 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.

The design of the Scribner edition cover was done by Platinum Fmd, the creators of the cover for King's 2009 novel ''[[Under the Dome (novel)|Under the Dome]]'', and Rex Bonomelli, Scribner's art director and designer. The preliminary version was simpler than the final version, which was designed to "give the cover a little more drama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/simonandschustercanada/posts/319730964758609 |title=Scribner's art... |publisher=Facebook |date=2012-04-17 |accessdate=2013-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412072254/https://www.facebook.com/simonandschustercanada/posts/319730964758609 |archivedate=2016-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The novel begins with Roland and his [[ka-tet]] arriving at a river on their journey to the Dark Tower. An elderly man who operates a ferry gets them across the river, and warns them that a severe [[low-pressure area|depression]] (starkblast) is coming, and that they can find shelter in a building a few miles ahead. They reach the shelter just in time, and while they wait out the storm, Roland tells them of an adventure in his youth to keep them occupied: "The Skin-Man."

Following the death of Roland's mother, his father sends him and his friend [[Jamie De Curry]] west to the town of Debaria on a mission to capture the [[Skin-walker|Skin-Man]], an apparent shape-shifter who terrorizes the town and surrounding areas by transforming into various animals at night and embarking on murderous rampages. Roland and Jamie take a train to Debaria, but it derails before arriving and they must finish their journey on horse. On their way, they pass through a town known as Serenity, a community of women where Roland's mother lived after suffering a mental breakdown following her affair with Marten Broadcloak, an alias of the sorcerer [[Randall Flagg]] and Roland's nemesis. It is here that they learn of a woman attacked by the Skin-Man and hear her tale.

Roland and Jamie arrive in Debaria, and with the help of the local Sheriff, Hugh Peavy, they determine that the Skin-Man is most likely a salt miner from a nearby village. The next morning, they discover that another brutal attack has occurred overnight on a local farm. They investigate the scene, and discover a single survivor, a small boy named Bill, who has lost his father in the attack. Roland and Jamie determine that the murderer left the scene on horseback, and Roland sends Jamie to the salt mines to round up every miner who has a horse or is able to ride one. While returning to Debaria with Bill, Roland performs his hypnotism trick (which Roland first used in his chronological life in [[Wizard and Glass]]) with one of his spare rounds of ammunition. Under hypnosis, Bill relates what he saw of the Skin-Man; Bill tells Roland that he saw the Skin-Man in his human form after the attack, but only glimpsed his feet. He states that the Skin-Man had a tattoo of a blue ring around his ankle. The tattoo indicates that the man spent time in the prison at a (now abandoned) military barracks further west of Debaria. That area had fallen to the chaos of [[John Farson]], the Good Man, within the last generation. Back in town, Roland brings Bill to a cell in Sheriff's station. He plans to walk each suspect past Bill in the hopes the young boy can identify the Skin-Man, or that the Skin-Man will reveal himself by fleeing due to fear of being identified. While Roland and Bill wait for Jamie to round up the suspects, Roland tells Bill a story from his own childhood, "The Wind Through the Keyhole."

In this [[Story within a story|story (within a story)]], a boy named Tim Ross lives with his mother Nell in a forgotten village that fears the annual collection of property taxes by a man named [[Randall Flagg|The Covenant Man]]. Tim recently lost his father, who was said to have been killed by a dragon while in the woods chopping trees. After the death of his father, Nell, no longer able to pay the taxes to keep their home, marries his father's best friend and business partner Bern Kells, who moves in with them. Kells is a mean man, prone to heavy drinking, who begins to abuse both Tim and Nell. One day The Covenant Man comes to collect the taxes, and he secretly tells Tim to meet him later in the woods. During this meeting, The Covenant Man reveals to Tim that it was actually Kells who killed his father, not a dragon, and with help of a scrying bowl shows Kells beating his mother, causing her to go blind. Later, The Covenant Man sends Tim a vision telling him that if Tim again visits The Covenant Man in the woods, he will give Tim magic that will allow his mother to see again. Tim, armed with a gun given to him by his school teacher, journeys into the dangerous woods, and is led into a swamp by the mischievous fairy, Armaneeta. Here, Tim almost becomes victim to a dragon and other mysterious swamp creatures, but he is saved by his gun as well as a group of friendly swamp people, who mistake him for a gunslinger. The swamp people guide him to the far side of the swamp, and equip him with a small mechanical talking device from the 'Old People' that helps guide him on his journey. Eventually, Tim arrives at a Dogan where he finds a caged 'tyger', which wears the key to the Dogan around its neck. A starkblast approaches, and Tim, realizing this is likely a trap set for him by The Covenant Man, befriends the tyger. Tim and the tyger ride out the storm under a magical protective blanket. The next morning, Tim discovers that the tyger is actually Maerlyn, a white magician, who had been trapped in the cage for years due to black magic. Maerlyn gives Tim a potion to cure his mother's blindness and sends him back to his mother on the flying magic blanket. Returning home, Tim brings sight back to his mother. Tim is attacked by Kells, who had secretly entered the home as Tim tended to his mother, but the boy is saved by his mother, who kills Kells with her late husband's ax.

As Roland finishes telling "The Wind Through the Keyhole," Jamie arrives back in Debaria with the salt mine suspects. Young Bill is able to identify the Skin-Man due to his ankle tattoo and an associated scar, at which time the Skin-Man transforms into a snake, and kills two people. Roland shoots the snake with a specially-crafted silver bullet (which he had made upon their arrival in town), killing it. Roland and Jamie travel back to Serenity, where the women agree to adopt young Bill, who is now an orphan. The women also give Roland a note written by his mother during her stay in Serenity. In this note, his mother reveals that Marten has predicted that Roland will one day kill her. Although this has caused her to slowly lose her sanity, in the end she forgives Roland and asks that he forgive her infidelity to his father and betrayal of Gilead in return.

With his Skin-Man story finished, Roland and his ka-tet find that the starkblast has passed, leveling every structure in the area except for the building in which they took shelter. They soon pack their belongings and resume their journey toward the Dark Tower.

==Reception==
An early review of the book by Kevin Quigley noted how well it meshed with novels in the series that came before and after. "Most importantly, it manages to retain the quest structure of the first four novels and also subtly underscores King's obsession with the nature of fiction in the latter books, providing a necessary bridge between the two halves of the series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/reviews/b25514_review_wind_through_keyhole_by_stephen.html|title=Review: 'The Wind Through the Keyhole' by Stephen King|publisher=FEARnet|date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Handlen too wondered if the late addition would stand up and found it in fact better than other parts of the sequence: “Where other books of the Dark Tower sequence got bogged down by a vain effort to make sense of it all, ''Wind Through The Keyhole'' has a light, easy touch."&lt;ref&gt;[https://aux.avclub.com/stephen-king-the-wind-through-the-keyhole-1798172598 AV Club, 30 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; While  impressed on the whole, James Kidd writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' noted the book's episodic nature, commenting that “it isn’t a novel but a triptych of novellas nesting inside one another”. But he was unhappy with the quality of the prose, describing it as a mixture of “King’s pithy folk wisdom and cod Shakespeare”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-wind-through-the-keyhole-by-stephen-king-7687292.html 29 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tiny Town &amp; Railroad''' is a miniature village containing over 100 1/6 scale buildings and a {{Track gauge|15 in|lk=on}} gauge [[Ridable miniature railway|miniature railway]] close to [[Morrison, Colorado]].

==History==
George Turner, owner of Denver business Turner Moving &amp; Storage and a friend of Buffalo Bill Cody, began building a miniature town for his daughter in 1915. Called '''Turnerville''', he opened the site to the public in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2002/08/19/story5.html |title=Tourists escape to local amusement venues |accessdate=2007-04-16 |last=Moore |first=Paula |date=2002-08-16 |work=Denver Business Journal |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turnerville quickly became one of the state's most popular attractions, but it was plagued by damage from adjacent Turkey Creek flooding and a fire burned down the Indian pueblo in 1935. The train was added in 1939 and the name became '''Tiny Town'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060703/COLUMNISTS02/607030341/0/BLOGS0502 |title=Tiny Town attracts big interest |accessdate=2007-04-16 |last=Billings |first=Hankd |date=2006-07-03 |format= |work=News-Leader (Springfield, MO) |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235221/http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060703%2FCOLUMNISTS02%2F607030341%2F0%2FBLOGS0502 |archivedate=2007-09-26 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 2010 fifteen people were injured as a train entered a curve at the park going between 12 and 17&amp;nbsp;mph, causing five of the six cars to tip over. An investigation determined the operator was not adequately trained in steam locomotive operation which resulted in confusion of the brake and throttle levers. The state fined Tiny Town $30,500 consisting of $1000 per incident the operator operated the train and $500 for not having documented training of emergency and safety procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/24703880/detail.html |title=State Fines Tiny Town $30,500 In Train Accident |accessdate= |last= |first= |date=2010-08-20 |work=7News |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35601">The {{nihongo|'''Tokyo Sports Puroresu Awards'''|東京スポーツプロレス大賞|Tōkyō Supōtsu Puroresu Taishō}} are Japanese [[professional wrestling]], or ''[[puroresu]]'', awards that have been handed out by the ''[[Tokyo Sports]]'' magazine annually since 1974. The most publicized awards in Japanese professional wrestling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = December 20, 2004 | title = Wrestling Observer Newsletter | magazine = [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are recognized by all the major promotions in the country, including [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.all-japan.co.jp/%E8%AB%8F%E8%A8%AA%E9%AD%94%E9%81%B8%E6%89%8B%E3%80%81%E7%9F%B3%E5%B7%9D%E4%BF%AE%E5%8F%B8%E9%81%B8%E6%89%8B%E3%81%8C2017%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6-%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%83%84 | script-title=ja:諏訪魔選手、石川修司選手が2017年度 東京スポーツ新聞社制定「プロレス大賞」最優秀タッグチーム賞 受賞!! | date=December 14, 2017 | accessdate=December 14, 2017 | work=[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.njpw.co.jp/81073 | script-title=ja:「2017年も、我々が様々な話題を提供します！」“MVP”内藤哲也が東京スポーツ『プロレス大賞』受賞式で、さらなるL・I・J旋風を宣言！【報告】 | date=January 19, 2017 | accessdate=December 14, 2017 | work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.noah.co.jp/news_detail.php?news_id=3592 | script-title=ja:東京スポーツ新聞社制定　2011年「プロレス大賞」受賞に際し各選手コメント | date=December 14, 2011 | accessdate=December 14, 2017 | work=[[Pro Wrestling Noah]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards are voted for by a committee made up of people involved with Japanese professional wrestling, including reporters and photographers. After the winners are announced in the middle of December, an award ceremony is held in [[Tokyo]] in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/wrestling/ | script-title=ja:東京スポーツ　プロレス大賞 | accessdate=December 14, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting takes place in rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/481197/ | script-title=ja:【プロレス大賞】創設以来初の「新人賞該当者なし」 | date=December 8, 2015 | accessdate=December 14, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In landslide cases, the winner can be determined in a single round of voting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/628787/ | script-title=ja:【プロレス大賞】ＭＶＰ内藤　ベストバウト級の好試合を連発した“新日プロの救世主” | date=December 14, 2016 | accessdate=December 14, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, if no wrestler gets enough votes, the award can be left blank and not given out that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = December 15, 2014 | title = Dec. 15, 2014 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: CM Punk to UFC 181, Tokyo Sports Awards, Jimmy Del Ray bio and much more | magazine = [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the award for [[#Joshi Puroresu Grand Prize|female wrestler of the year]] was not given out between 2004 and 2008 and again in 2014, when the committee felt that no wrestler had the necessary qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/343284/ | script-title=ja:女子プロレス大賞 ６年ぶり該当者なし | date=December 9, 2014 | accessdate=December 14, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards have been described as "legit to a degree", but also with the goal of spreading them among different major promotions. For example, the award for the [[#Technique Award|best technical wrestler]] may not be given to someone actually considered the best technical wrestler in ''puroresu'', but to a top wrestler from a promotion that has not gotten any of the other awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = December 18, 2017 | title = December 18, 2017 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: The metamorphosis of Chris Jericho, GSP vacates title, more | magazine = [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently ten active awards given out by ''Tokyo Sports'', including one dedicated to [[sport wrestling]].

'''ČT art''' is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] national [[television]] channel, operated by [[Česká televize]] specialising in cultural content. The channel began broadcasting on 31 August 2013, with Tomáš Motl as its first executive director.&lt;ref name="ČT art"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/216070-ct-art-tolik-kultury-kolik-unesete/|title=ČT art - tolik kultury, kolik unesete — Kultura — ČT24 — Česká televize|last=Benediktová|first=Jana|date=21 February 2015|work=[[Česká televize]]|language=Czech|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ČT art broadcasts from 8&amp;nbsp;pm to 6&amp;nbsp;am, and shares its frequency with children's channel [[ČT Déčko]] which uses the remaining hours.&lt;ref name="ČT art"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art.ihned.cz/c1-59370300-ceska-televize-kulturni-kanal-ct-art-schema-porady|title=Festivalové filmy, opera nebo jazz. Jaké poøady bude vysílat kulturní kanál ÈT art?|date=21 February 2013|work=Hospodářské Noviny|language=Czech|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Each day begins with the news programme ''Události v kultuře'' (News in culture), and on Sundays ''Týden v kultuře'' (Week in culture), these are supplemented by inputs from live events and current affairs talk shows with cultural themes. Across the week, each day is given a theme for programming:
*Monday - ''Z první řady'' (The first row), student work, work from [[Slovenská televízia]].
*Tuesday - ''ČT Live'' (Czech contemporary music), ''Galerie Kavky'' (fine arts).
*Wednesday - Cultural magazines: ''Canale Grande'', ''Terra Musica'', ''333'', and ''Artmix''.
*Thursday - Czech documentaries and literature.
*Friday - Culture guide: ''Kulturní bedekr'', and film magazine: ''Film 2013''.
*Saturday - ''Je nám ctí'' - celebrities, topics or events, musical show ''Tečka za sobotní nocí''.
*Sunday - World art films, classical music.

===Future===
Česká televize stated that if ČT Déčko and ČT art proved successful, the two channels would broadcast from separate frequencies and allowing them to broadcast 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name="ČT art"/&gt;

==Broadcasting==
===HD===
[[High-definition television|High-definition]] (HD) broadcasting via satellite was started on 1 November 2016 using [[Astra 3B]]-capacities.
