'''Adolph Abramovich Joffe''' ({{lang-ru|Адо́льф Абра́мович Ио́ффе}}, alternative transliterations '''Adolf Ioffe''' or, rarely, '''Yoffe''') (10 October 1883 in [[Simferopol]]&amp;nbsp;– 16 November 1927 in [[Moscow]]) was a [[Communist]] [[revolutionary]], a [[Bolshevik]] [[politician]] and a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[diplomat]] of [[Crimean Karaites|Karaite]] descent.

==Biography==

===Revolutionary career===

Adolf Abramovich Joffe was born in [[Simferopol]], [[Crimea]], [[Russian Empire]]  in a wealthy [[Crimean Karaites|Karaite]] family.&lt;ref name="karaite"&gt;See Albert S. Lindemann. ''Esau's Tears: Modern Anti-Semitism and the Rise of the Jews'', Cambridge University Press, 1997; pg. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[social democrat]] in 1900 while still in [[high school]], formally joining the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]] in 1903. In 1904 Joffe was sent to [[Baku]], which he had to flee to avoid arrest. He was then sent to [[Moscow]], but had to flee again, this time abroad. After the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]] on January 9, 1905, Joffe returned to Russia and took an active part in the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. In early 1906 he was forced to emigrate and lived in [[Berlin]] until his expulsion from [[Germany]] in May 1906.

In Russia, Joffe was close to the [[Menshevik]] faction within the Russian Social Democratic Party. However, after moving to [[Vienna]] in May 1906, he became close to [[Leon Trotsky]]'s position and helped Trotsky edit ''[[Pravda]]'' from 1908 to 1912 while studying [[medicine]] and with [[Alfred Adler]], [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name="psychoanalysis"&gt;See Chapter XVII of Leon Trotsky's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch17.htm 'My Life'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305033203/http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-lif/ch17.htm |date=March 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used his family's fortune to support ''Pravda'' financially. During the course of his underground revolutionary activity Joffe adopted the [[pseudonym|party name]] "V. Krymsky," the surname meaning "The Crimean."&lt;ref&gt;Nadezhda A. Joffe, ''Back in Time: My Life, My Fate, My Epoch: The Memoirs of Nadezhda A. Joffe.'' Frederick S. Choate, trans. Oak Park, MI: Labor Publications, 1995; pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 Joffe was arrested while visiting [[Odessa]], imprisoned for 10 months and then exiled to [[Siberia]].

===1917 Revolution===

In 1917, Joffe, freed from the Siberian exile by the [[February Revolution]], returned to the Crimea. Crimean social democrats sent him to the capital, [[Petrograd]], to represent them, but he soon moved to an internationalist revolutionary position, which made it impossible for him to remain in an organization dominated by less radical Mensheviks. Instead, he joined forces with Trotsky, who had just returned from abroad.

In May 1917, Joffe and Trotsky temporarily joined [[Mezhraiontsy]] who merged with the [[Bolshevik]]s at the [[6th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)|VIth Bolshevik Party Congress]] held between 26 July and 3 August 1917 (all dates are [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]] until February 1918). At the Congress, Joffe was elected a candidate (non-voting) member of the Central Committee, but two days later, on August 5, the Central Committee, some of whose members were in prison, in hiding or lived far from Petrograd and couldn't attend its meetings, made Joffe a member of its permanent ("narrow") bureau. On August 6, Joffe was made an alternate member of the [[Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee|Central Committee Secretariat]] and on August 20 made a member of the editorial board of the Bolshevik newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' which was then temporarily called ''Proletary'' (''Proletarian'') for legal reasons.

Joffe headed the Bolshevik faction in the Petrograd [[Duma]] (city government) in the fall of 1917 and was one of the Duma's delegates to the [[Democratic Conference]] between September 14 and 22. Although Joffe, along with Lenin and Trotsky, opposed the Bolsheviks' participation in the consultative [[Pre-parliament]] created by the Democratic Conference, the motion was carried by the majority of Bolshevik deputies at the Democratic Conference and Joffe was made a Bolshevik member of the Pre-parliament. Two weeks later, on October 7, once the more radical Bolshevik faction gained the upper hand, Joffe and other Bolsheviks walked out of the Pre-parliament.

In October 1917, Joffe supported Lenin's and Trotsky's revolutionary position against [[Grigory Zinoviev]]'s and [[Lev Kamenev]]'s more moderate position, demanding that the latter be expelled from the Central Committee after an apparent breach of [[party discipline]]. Joffe served as the Chairman of the Petrograd [[Military Revolutionary Committee]] which overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] on October 25–26, 1917. Immediately after the revolution, he supported Lenin and Trotsky against Zinoviev, Kamenev, [[Alexei Rykov]] and other Bolshevik Central Committee members who would have shared power with other socialist parties.

===Brest-Litovsk===

From November 30, 1917, until January 1918, Joffe was the head of the Soviet delegation that was sent to [[Brest-Litovsk]] to negotiate an end to the hostilities with Germany. On December 22, 1917, Joffe announced the following Bolshevik pre-conditions for a peace treaty:&lt;ref name="peace"&gt;Quoted in Arno J. Mayer. ''Political Origins of the New Diplomacy, 1917-1918'', Yale Historical Publications, Studies 18, 1959. Reprinted as ''Wilson vs. Lenin: Political Origins of the New Diplomacy, 1917-1918'', Cleveland, World Pub. Co., 1964; pg. ???&lt;/ref&gt;

*No forcible annexation of territories seized in the war
*Restore national independence where it was terminated during war
*National groups independent before the war should be allowed by referendum to decide question of independence
*Multi-cultural regions should be administered so as to allow all possible cultural independence and self-regulation
*No indemnities. Personal losses should be compensated out of international fund
*Colonial question should be decided according to points 1–4

Although Joffe had signed a ceasefire agreement with the [[Central Powers]] on December 2, 1917, he supported Trotsky in the latter's refusal to sign a permanent peace treaty in February.{{efn|[[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs]], appointed Joffe to lead the negotiation team, but Trotsky resigned his post prior to the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.}} Once the Bolshevik Central Committee decided to sign the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on February 23, 1918, Joffe remained a member of the Soviet delegation only under protest and in a purely consultative capacity. [[Grigori Sokolnikov|Grigori Yakovlovich Sokolnikov]], leader of the signatory team, signed on behalf of Russia.

Remembering Joffe's presence with the Bolshevik delegation at Brest-Litovsk, [[Count Ottokar Czernin]], the Austro-Hungarians' representative would later write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The leader of the Russian delegation is a Jew, named Joffe, who has recently been released from Siberia [...] after the meal I had a first conversation with Mr. Joffe. His whole theory is simply based on the universal application of the right of self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...'&lt;ref&gt;Czernin von und zu Chudenitz, Ottokar Theobald Otto Maria (1920). ''In the World War''. New York and London: Harper &amp; Brothers. ''Internet Archive''. Retrieved 28 Feb. 2009. https://archive.org/stream/inworldwar00czer/inworldwar00czer_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the [[7th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|VIIth Extraordinary Congress of the Bolshevik Party]] between March 6 and March 8, 1918, Joffe was re-elected to the Central Committee, but only as a candidate (non-voting) member. He remained in Petrograd when the Soviet government moved to Moscow later in March and worked as a member of the Petrograd Bureau of the Central Committee until he was appointed Soviet representative to Germany in April. He signed the [[Soviet-German Supplementary Treaty]] on August 27, 1918. On November 6, 1918, literally days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] and the [[German Revolution]], the Soviet delegation in [[Berlin]] headed by Joffe was expelled from the country on charges of preparing a Communist uprising in Germany.

===Diplomatic career===
[[File:Joffe signing the Treaty of Tartu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Joffe signing [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]]]]

In 1919–1920, Joffe was a member of the [[Council of Labor and Defense]] and [[People's Commissar]] (minister) of State Control of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Soviet Republic. He wasn't re-elected to the Central Committee at the [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|VIII Party Congress]] in March 1919 and would never again occupy a major leadership position. He negotiated a ceasefire with [[Poland]] in October 1920 and peace treaties with [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] in late 1920. In 1921 he signed the [[Peace of Riga]] with Poland ending the [[Polish-Soviet War]] and was made deputy chairman of the [[Turkestan]] Commission of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|VTsIK]] and [[Sovnarkom]].

Joffe was one of the Soviet delegates at the [[Genoa Conference]] in February 1922, an experience he described in a short book published later that same year.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Ioffe (V. Krymskii), ''Genuezskaia Konferentsiia'' (The Genoa Conference). Moscow: Krasnaia Nov', 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Soviet walkout, he was made ambassador to China, as the Soviet troubleshooter (or Kuznetsov) of those days. In 1923, Joffe signed an agreement with [[Sun Yat-Sen]] in Shanghai on aid to [[Kuomintang]] on the assumption that the latter would cooperate with [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]], presumably with Lenin's approval.&lt;ref name="china"&gt;See ''A Brief Chronology of China Since 1915'' in K. S. Karol's ''China. The Other Communism'', New York, Hill and Wang, 1967, {{ISBN|0-8090-1344-4}} (1968 pbk)&lt;/ref&gt; While in China, Joffe traveled to Japan in June 1923 to settle Soviet-Japanese relations.&lt;ref name="japan"&gt;For a [[Trotskyist]] perspective on the impact of Joffe's visit on the [[Japanese Communist Party]], see ''The Meiji Restoration: A Bourgeois Non-Democratic Revolution'' published in ''Spartacist'', English edition, [http://www.icl-fi.org/english/esp/58/meiji.html No. 58] for 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations proved long and difficult and were aborted when Joffe became gravely ill and had to be sent back to Moscow. After a partial recovery, he served as a member of the Soviet delegation to [[Great Britain]] in 1924 and as Soviet representative in [[Austria]] in 1924–1926. 

In 1926 his declining health and disagreements with the ruling Bolshevik faction forced his semi-retirement. He tried to concentrate on teaching, but it also proved difficult due to his illness.

===Opposition and suicide===

Joffe remained a friend and loyal supporter of Leon Trotsky through the 1920s, joining him in the [[Left Opposition]]. By late 1927, he was gravely ill, in extreme pain and confined to his bed. After a refusal by the [[Stalinist]] leadership of the Communist Party to send him abroad for treatment and Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party on November 12, 1927, he committed suicide on November 16. He left a farewell letter addressed to Trotsky, but the letter was seized by Soviet secret police agents and later quoted by Stalinists to discredit both Joffe and Trotsky. Trotsky's eulogy at Joffe's funeral was his last public speech in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Joffe, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jk0k_LBDmHEC&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 65]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joffe's wife Maria Joffe was arrested as a left-oppositionist [[Trotskyist]] by Stalin's security forces, yet she survived to write her memoirs ''One Long Night – A Tale of Truth''.
Joffe's daughter, [[Nadezhda Joffe]], also an active Trotskyist, survived Stalin's prisons and [[labor camps]] and published a memoir, ''Back in Time: My Life, My Fate, My Epoch''.

[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 1320287 nevit.jpg|thumb|[[Phrygia#Culture|Phrygian statue of Kybele/Agdistis]] from the mid-6th century BCE at or near [[Hattusa]]]]
'''Agdistis''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄγδιστις}}) was a deity of [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Roman mythology|Roman]] and [[Anatolian mythology|Anatolian]] mythology, possessing both male and female [[genitalia|sexual organs]]. She is closely associated with the [[Phrygia]]n goddess [[Cybele]].&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link =   | contribution = Agdistis  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 67  | publisher =   | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0076.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her [[androgyny]] was seen as symbolic of a wild and uncontrollable nature. It was this trait which was threatening to the gods and ultimately led to her destruction.&lt;ref name="brill"/&gt;

==Mythology==
According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], on one occasion [[Zeus]] unwittingly begot by the [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]] a superhuman being which was at once man and woman, and was called Agdistis.  In other versions, there was a rock, called "Agdo", on which the [[Cybele|Great Mother]] slept.  Zeus impregnated the Great Mother (Gaia), which brought forth Agdistis.&lt;ref name="dad"&gt;{{Cite book  | last =   | first =   | author-link =   | contribution = Agdistis  | editor-last = Turner  | editor-first = Patricia  | title = Dictionary of Ancient Deities  | volume = 1  | pages = 24  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | place = Oxford  | year =   | contribution-url =  | postscript =   &lt;!--None--&gt;  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gods were afraid of the multi-gendered Agdistis.  One deity (in some versions [[Liber]], in others [[Dionysus]]) put a sleeping draught in Agdistis's drinking well.  After the potion had put Agdistis to sleep, [[Dionysus]] tied Agdistis's foot to his own male genitalia ({{lang|grc|φαλλός}}) with a strong rope.  When Agdistis awoke and stood, Agdistis ripped his [[penis]] off, [[castration|castrating]] himself.&lt;ref name="dad"/&gt;  The blood from his severed genitals fertilized the earth, and from that spot grew an [[almond]] tree.  Once when [[Nana (Greek mythology)|Nana]], daughter of the river-god [[Sangarius (mythology)|Sangarius]], was gathering the fruit of this tree, she put some almonds (or, in some accounts, a [[pomegranate]]) into her bosom;&lt;ref name="dad"/&gt; but here the almonds disappeared, and she became pregnant with [[Attis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' vii. 17. § 7.9-13&lt;/ref&gt;  In some versions, Attis was born directly out of the almond.&lt;ref name="dad"/&gt;

Attis was of such extraordinary beauty that when he had grown up Agdistis fell in love with him.  His relatives, however, destined him to become the husband of the daughter of the king of [[Pessinus]], and he went accordingly.  In some versions, the king betroths Attis to his daughter to punish Attis for his [[incest]]uous relationship with his mother.&lt;ref name="brill"/&gt;  At the moment when the marriage song had commenced, Agdistis appeared, and all the wedding guests were instantly driven [[insanity|mad]], causing both Attis and the king of Pessinus to [[castration|castrate]] themselves and the bride to cut off her breasts.  Agdistis now repented her deed, and obtained from Zeus the promise that the body of Attis should not become [[decomposition|decomposed]] or disappear.  This is the most popular account of an otherwise mysterious affair, which is probably part of a symbolical worship of the creative powers of nature.  A hill of the name of Agdistis in [[Phrygia]], at the foot of which Attis was believed to be buried, is also mentioned by Pausanias.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 4. § 5&lt;/ref&gt;

A story somewhat different is given by [[Arnobius]], in which Attis is beloved by both Agdistis and [[Cybele]].&lt;ref name="brill"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lancellotti  | first = Maria Grazia  | authorlink =   | title = Attis, Between Myth and History: King, Priest, and God  | publisher = [[Brill Publishers]]  | year = 2002  | location = Amsterdam  | pages = 20, 92  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oE8vW4BX9kwC  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 90-04-12851-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Gentes'' ix. 5. § 4; comp. Mimic. Felix, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult of Agdistis==
According to [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesychius of Alexandria]], ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Strabo]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], xii. p. 567; comp. x. p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; Agdistis is the same as [[Cybele]], who was worshiped at [[Pessinus]] under that name.  In many ancient inscriptions, Agdistis is clearly distinct from Cybele, but in many others she is listed as merely an [[epithet]] of Cybele.&lt;ref name="soter"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Gasparro  | first = Giulia Sfameni  | authorlink =   | title = Soteriology and Mystic Aspects in the Cult of Cybele and Attis  | publisher = [[Brill Publishers]]  | year = 1985  | location = Amsterdam  | pages = 34  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=K_EUAAAAIAAJ  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 90-04-07283-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although primarily an [[Anatolia]]n goddess, the cult of Agdistis covered a good deal of territory.  By 250 BC it had spread to [[Egypt]], and later to [[Attica]]: notably it could be found in [[Piraeus]] as early as the 3rd or 4th century BC, [[Rhamnus (Greek archaeological site)|Rhamnus]] around 80 BC (where there was a [[sanctuary]] of Agdistis),&lt;ref name="soter"/&gt; and [[Lesbos]] and [[Panticapeum]] some time later on.

Scholars have theorized that Agdistis is part of a continuum of [[androgyny|androgynous]] Anatolian deities, including an ancient [[Phrygia]]n deity probably named "Andistis" and one called "Adamma", stretching all the way back to the ancient kingdom of [[Kizzuwatna]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]].  There is also some [[epigram|epigraphic]] evidence that in places Agdistis was considered a healing goddess of wholly benevolent nature.&lt;ref name="brill"/&gt;

'''Anna Hunt''' is a journalist, author and [[shaman]]. Her book, ''The Shaman In Stilettos'', chronicles her journey from celebrity interviewer, to apprentice to a Peruvian shaman in the High Andes, to becoming a London-based shaman in her own right.

== Early life ==

Hunt was born into a small family in a village outside [[Southampton, England]], and went to school at [[Cheltenham Ladies’ College]].  She read History at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], where she was awarded an MA.

== Journalism ==

Hunt started her journalism career making television documentaries for the UK’s [[Channel 4]], before moving into newspapers. She began as PA to the editor of ''[[The Daily Express]]'' and was promoted to launch editor of a weekend supplement that added one million readers to the paper’s circulation. Hunt left to establish herself as a celebrity interviewer, writing for ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Mail On Sunday]]'', ''[[The Independent On Sunday]]'', ''[[The Sunday Express]]'' and the [[BBC]]’s ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Anna|title=Expert Witnesses|journal=Radio Times|date=3 March 2006|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By age 27, she was working full-time as features editor of ''The Mail On Sunday’s'' 'Night &amp; Day' magazine, the highest-selling quality newspaper supplement in the UK.

== Peru and Shamanism ==

Stress-induced health challenges that she says allopathic medicine couldn’t cure led Hunt to take a three-month sabbatical to [[Peru]] in 2003.  There she met the [[shaman]] Maximo Morales, a former archeologist turned medicine man.  Despite Hunt’s initial cynicism, Morales appeared to restore her health with a range of techniques that included the use of the [[entheogenic]] plants [[Echinopsis pachanoi|San Pedro]] and [[ayahuasca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Slater| first = Cheryl|title=Interview with Anna Hunt, mindbodyspirit.co.uk|url=http://www.mindbodyspirit.co.uk/blog/interview-with-anna-hunt-shaman-stilletos/|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was transformative for Hunt, and Morales invited her to study with him as his apprentice – an extraordinary invitation, as the ancient healing arts are traditionally passed down only from shaman to shaman, orally and in strict secrecy.

Two years later, Hunt returned to Peru to accept the offer. She spent six months studying with Morales and interviewing over forty shamans, travelling from the high Andes to the depths of the Amazon rainforest. She then returned to London to practise independently.  In 2012, [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] published an account of her experiences, ''The Shaman In Stilettos'', which the ''Daily Mail'' described as "the English ''Eat Pray Love''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connell|first=Claudia|title=Wisdom in a Pair of Calvin Klein Underpants|journal=The Daily Mail|date=15 June 2012|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Avathara Pathi''''' is a phrase in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] which represents 'The place where God incarnates'. The Avathara Pathi is one among the holy places of [[Ayyavazhi]],''(see: [[Ayyavazhi Holy Sites]])'' which had been erected in [[Thiruchendur]]. Avathara Pathi is located half-a-mile south to the Murugan Temple, at the sea-shore."Makara Theertham" (the primary sea-theertham as per [[Akilam]]) is located here.

According to [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] (the holy text of [[Ayyavazhi]]) [[Lord Narayana]]  incarnated as [[Ayya Vaikundar]] and arose from the sea at this place. In honour of this event the Avatharappathi is erected there. This was not included in Panchappathi.

'''Banjhākri and Banjhākrini''' are shamanic [[deities]] in the tradition of the [[Tamang people]] of [[Nepal]]. The two are a couple, and possibly different aspects of the same being.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pratt |first=Christina |title=An Encyclopedia of Shamanism |volume=Volume One: A–M |url= |year=2007 |publisher=[[Rosen Publishing]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-4042-1040-0 |oclc=71778910 |pages=54–55}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 January 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are supernatural [[shaman]]s of the forest. In the [[Nepali language]], ''ban'' means "wilderness", ''[[Jhakri|jhākri]]'' means "shaman", and ''jhākrini'' means "shamaness". Banjhākrini is also known as '''Lemlemey'''.

Banjhākri is a short, wild, simian [[trickster]] who is a descendant of the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt; His ears are large and his feet point backward. Long, matted hair covers his entire body, except for his face and palms,&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peters |first=L. G. |year=1997 |title=The 'Calling', the Yeti, and the Ban Jhakri ('Forest Shaman') in Nepalese Shamanism |journal=[[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=51–52 |publisher=Association for Transpersonal Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he plays a golden [[dhyāngro]].&lt;ref name="Sidky"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sidky |first=Homayun |title=Haunted by the Archaic Shaman: Himalayan Jhākris and the Discourse on Shamanism |chapter=Ban-Jhākri: Supernatural Abductions and Shamanic Initiation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzIPSP_blC0C&amp;pg=PA150 |accessdate=3 January 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Lexington Books]] |location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]] |isbn=9780739126219 |oclc=191206807 |pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dhyangro is the [[frame drum]] played by Nepali jhākri.

Banjhākri finds human children who have the potential to be great shamans, and takes them back to his cave for training. There, the children are in danger of being eaten whole by Banjhākrini. Banjhākrini is both [[wikt:ursine|ursine]] and humanoid, with long hair on her head, long, pendulous breasts, and backward-pointing feet. She is usually described as bloodthirsty and brutal. She carries a symbolic golden [[sickle]].&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;

Although Banjhākri abducts boys (and, by some accounts, girls), he does not do so out of malice. He trains the children who pass Banjhākrini's initiation. When the children return home with their shamanic training, they can become more powerful than the shamans trained by people.

Like the [[yeti]], Banjhākri and Banjhākrini can be seen in our world, and not just in the spirit world. However, only powerful shamans can see them. Although both Banjhākri and yeti are apelike, yeti are taller than humans, whereas Banjhākri is only about 1–1.5 metres (3–5 feet) tall.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;

A scholar has suggested that Banjhākri is a [[therianthrope]]; a humanoid who changes into a non-human animal form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.units.muohio.edu/anthropology/users/sidkyh |title=Dr. Homayun Sidky |work=Department of Anthropology Faculty/Staff |publisher=[[Miami University]] |accessdate=4 January 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sidky" /&gt;

Some legends say that there are numerous ban-jhākri and ban-jhākrini. In any case, the shamans of Nepal regard the original Banjhākri as the founder of Nepali shamanism. Banjhākri is revered and celebrated as a teacher and as the god of the forest.&lt;ref name="Sidky" /&gt;

The '''Cedars of God''' ({{lang-ar|أرز الربّ}} ''Arz ar-Rabb'' "Cedars of the Lord") is one of the last vestiges of the extensive [[forest]]s of the [[Cedrus libani|Lebanon cedar]], that once thrived across [[Mount Lebanon]] in ancient times. Their timber was used by the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Egypt]]ians, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]],  and [[Turkish people|Turks]]. The wood was prized by Egyptians for [[shipbuilding]]; the [[Ottoman Empire]] used the cedars in railway construction.&lt;ref name="thecedars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeast.com/thecedars.htm|title=The Cedars|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The mountains of [[Lebanon]] were once shaded by thick cedar forests and the tree is the symbol of the country. After centuries of persistent [[deforestation]], the extent of these forests has been markedly reduced.&lt;ref name="cedarsforever.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedarsforever.com/history.html|title=Cedars for Ever|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once said that a battle occurred between the demigods and the humans over the beautiful and divine forest of Cedar trees near southern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="blueplanetbiomes.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/lebanon_cedar.htm|title=Lebanon Cedar - Cedrus libani|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This forest, once protected by the [[Sumer]]ian god [[Enlil]], was completely bared of its trees when humans entered its grounds 4700 years ago, after winning the battle against the guardians of the forest, the demigods.&lt;ref name="blueplanetbiomes.org"/&gt;  The story also tells that [[Gilgamesh]] used cedar wood to build his city.

Over the centuries, cedar wood was exploited by the Phoenicians, Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Romans, Israelites and Turks.&lt;ref name="cedarsforever.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blueplanetbiomes.org"/&gt;  The Phoenicians used the Cedars for their merchant fleets. They needed timbers for their ships and the Cedar woods made them the “first sea trading nation in the world”.&lt;ref name="lebanon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanon.com/tourism/cedars.htm|title=Tourism @ Lebanon.com|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians used cedar resin for the mummification process and the cedar wood for some of “their first hieroglyph bearing rolls of papyrus”.&lt;ref name="lebanon.com"/&gt;  In the [[Bible]], [[Solomon]] procured cedar timber to build the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="ourladyoflebanon-dc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourladyoflebanon-dc.org/histcedars.html|title=Welcome to Our Lady Of Lebanon Maronite Church's Homepage|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602041955/http://www.ourladyoflebanon-dc.org/histcedars.html#|archive-date=2009-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emperor [[Hadrian]] claimed these forests as an imperial domain, and destruction of the cedar forests was temporarily halted.

Concern for the biblical "cedars of God" goes back to 1876, when the {{convert|102|ha|adj=on}} grove was surrounded by a high stone wall, paid for by [[Queen Victoria]], to protect saplings from browsing by goats.&lt;ref name="thecedars"/&gt; Nevertheless, during [[World War I]], British troops used cedar to build railroads.&lt;ref name="lebanon.com"/&gt;

Time, along with the exploitation of the Cedars’ wood, has led to a decrease in the number of cedar trees in Lebanon. However, Lebanon is still widely known for its cedar tree history, as they are the emblem of the country and the symbol of the Lebanese flag.&lt;ref name="ourladyoflebanon-dc.org"/&gt; The remaining trees survive in mountainous areas, where they are the dominant tree species. This is the case on the slopes of Mount Makmel that tower over the [[Kadisha Valley]], where the Cedars of God are found at an altitude of more than {{convert|2000|m|ft}}. Four trees have reached a height of {{convert|35|m|ft}}, with their trunks reaching {{convert|12|-|14|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="thecedars"/&gt;

==World Heritage Site==
In 1998, the Cedars of God were added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.

==Current status==
The forest is rigorously protected. It is possible to tour it escorted by an authorized guide. After a preliminary phase in which the land was cleared of [[detritus]], the sick plants treated, and the ground fertilized, the "Committee of the Friends of the Cedar Forest" initiated a reforestation program in 1985. These efforts will only be appreciable in a few decades due to the slow growth of cedars. In these areas the winter offers incredible scenery, and the trees are covered with a blanket of snow.

===Religious texts===
The [[Cedar Forest]] of [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] appears in several sections of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

The Lebanon Cedar is frequently mentioned in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Hutton Balfour |year=1885 |title=The Plants of the Bible |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson and Sons]] |location=London |chapter=Cedar-tree of Lebanon (''Cedrus libani'') |pages=21–27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kKoCJ3g5WQC&amp;pg=PA21 |isbn=978-1-4400-8073-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor=David Noel Freedman |title=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible |publisher=Wm.

* "Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down." (Zechariah 11:1, 2)
* "He moves his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit." (Job 40:17)
* "The priest shall take cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet stuff, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer" (Numbers 19:6)
* "The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon" (Psalm 29:5)
* "The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like the cedar in Lebanon" (Psalm 92:12)
* "I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive" (Isaiah 41: 19)
* "Behold, I will liken you to a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches and forest shade" (Ezekiel 31:3)
* "I destroyed the [[Amorites|Amorite]] before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars" (Amos 2:9)
*"The trees of the Lord are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted." (Psalm 104:16 NRSV)
*[King Solomon made] cedar as plentiful as the sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. (1 Kings 10:27, NIV, excerpt)

===Literary texts===
[[Alphonse de Lamartine]] visited the place during his travel in Lebanon (1832–33), and mentioned the cedars in some texts. [[Henry Bordeaux]] came also in 1922 and wrote, ''Yamilé'', a story about the place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3874">'''Charlotte Elisheva Fonrobert''' (born 1965 in Düsseldorf, Germany) is a professor in the Religious Studies department of [[Stanford University]]. She specializes in [[Judaism]], especially talmudic literature and culture. Her research interests include gender in Jewish culture, the relationship between Judaism and Christianity in [[Late Antiquity]], the discourses of orthodoxy versus heresy, and rabbinic conceptions of Judaism with respect to Greco-Roman culture. She completed her graduate training at the [[Graduate Theological Union]] in Berkeley, CA. In 2007 she wrote the article [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/gender-identity-in-halakhic-discourse Gender Identity In Halakhic Discourse] for ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia''; this is likely the first scholarly article on the topic.&lt;ref name="jweekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/72653/the-space-between-stanford-prof-talmudic-rabbis-were-into-analyzing-sexuali/|publisher=jweekly.com|title=the space between &amp;#124; Stanford prof: Talmudic rabbis were into analyzing sexuality &amp;#8211; J.|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she was named to the inaugural membership of the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]] North American Scholars Circle.

Fonrobert is the author of ''Menstrual Purity: Rabbinic and Christian Reconstructions of Biblical Gender'' (2000), which won the Salo Baron Prize for a best first book in Jewish Studies of the year and was a finalist for the National Jewish Book Award in Jewish Scholarship. She also wrote the essay "Regulating the Human Body: Rabbinic Legal Discourse and the Making of Jewish Gender", which was included in the book ''Balancing on the Mechitza: Transgender in Jewish Community'', edited by Noach Dzmura, and in the book ''Keep Your Wives Away from Them: Orthodox Women, Unorthodox Desires: an Anthology'', edited by Miryam Kabakov.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Balancing on the Mechitza: Transgender in Jewish Community|author=Dzmura, N.|date=2014|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781583949719|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KNLrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242|page=242|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Keep Your Wives Away from Them: Orthodox Women, Unorthodox Desires : an Anthology|author=Kabakov, M.|date=2010|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781556438790|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=swe9abXKmYcC|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is currently working on a project which examines the relationship between religious identity and space, ranging from urban neighborhoods to the wilderness, in Jewish and Christian Late Antiquity. As part of this project, she edited and introduced a collection of articles on the subject of "Jewish Conceptions and Practices of Space" together with Vered Shemtov ([[Stanford University]]). She also co-edited the Cambridge Companion to Rabbinic Literature, with Martin Jaffee ([[University of Washington]]).

'''Dafydd ap Maredudd Glais''' was a 15th century Welsh cleric. He was also a civil official, a translator of a chronicle of the Kings of England into Welsh, and a convicted murderer. His name is first recorded in the Ministers’ Accounts for [[Cardiganshire]], in 1429, associated with John Robury and Griffith Prouth (also described as clerics, assumed to belong to the church at [[Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion|Llanbadarn]], regarding a pledge for Thomas Kirkham, abbot of [[Vale Royal Abbey|Vale Royal]]. Dafydd is later recorded as having been convicted of the murder of Griffith Prouth but, being in holy orders, was fined rather than being condemned to death. Stripped of his orders, he then followed other members of his family in municipal service, and is later recorded as being provost of Aberystwyth. In 1444 he wrote his own translation of the [[Historia Regum Britanniae]] from Latin into Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dafydd ap Maredudd Glais|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAFY-APM-1429.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">'''Dasakuta'''  was one of two divisions (along with [[Vyasakuta]])  of [[Haridasa]]s, a group within  the [[Bhakti movement]], one  of the [[monotheistic]]  [[Hindu]] religious [[devotional movements]] focusing on the spiritual practice  of loving devotion to a God, called [[bhakti]]. This generally means the  worship of [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]] or [[Shakti]].
==History==
During the rule of the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] in [[South India]] in the 12th and 13th centuries A.D., the [[Haridasa]] movement spread from the area of modern  [[Karnataka]]. The [[Lingayatism]] movement (the term is derived from Lingavantha in [[Kannada]]), spread the philosophy of [[Basavanna]], a Hindu reformer.
The [[Vyasakuta]] were required to be proficient in the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]] and other [[Darshana]]s.&lt;ref name="dvaita"&gt;{{cite web

'''George Edward David Pytches''' (born 9 January 1931)&lt;ref&gt;‘PYTCHES, Rt Rev. (George Edward) David’, Who's Who 2012, A &amp; C Black, 2012; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2011 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U31665 Accessed 23 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bishop]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] and the former [[Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America|Bishop of Chile, Bolivia &amp; Peru]]. Pytches was also [[vicar]] of St Andrew's, in [[Chorleywood]] [[England]]. He is the author of many books, including ''[[Come Holy Spirit (book)|Come Holy Spirit]]'' and his autobiography, ''Living at the Edge''. He is the founder of the [[New Wine]] conferences with his wife Mary, who is also an author in the field of Christian counselling.

Pytches supported the [[Soul Survivor (charity)|Soul Survivor]] movement in [[England]] during its early days and throughout its history; for example, the Soul in the City event was supported by a large donation received from a New Wine conference only days before.

Pytches, along with Bishop [[C. FitzSimons Allison]] and four others, participated in the consecration in 2000, in [[Singapore]], of two bishops opposed to the [[blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessing of same-sex unions]] by the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church USA]].

Pytches and his wife gave the leadership of [[New Wine]] over to John and Anne Coles in 2001, but still visit the conferences every year and continue to speak there.

The appointment of Pytches's son-in-law, the Reverend Canon Dr [[Christopher Cocksworth]], as the 9th [[Bishop of Coventry]] and youngest serving diocesan [[bishop]] in the [[Church of England]], was announced in March 2008.

'''Dewi Lanjar''' is an Indonesian goddess of the sea, the opposite of [[Nyai Roro Kidul]] and the Queen of the Northern Sea, according to [[Kebatinan|Javanese beliefs]]. She is a popular goddess in the city of [[Pekalongan]], [[Central Java]]. Her name "Lanjar" means a woman who is divorced but still have no children.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Muhammad Sholikhin. "Kanjeng Ratu Kidul dalam perspektif Islam Jawa", hal. 114-116. Yogyakarta: Penerbit NARASI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth==
The people of Pekalongan in particular still have a strong belief of Dewi Lanjar. For example, if a child goes missing at the beach, people believe that the child was taken by Dewi Lanjar. It is said that her palace is located on the beach of Pekalongan, next to the Slamaran river. &lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Origin==
In ancient times in Pekalongan there lived a beautiful princess named Dewi Rara Kuning. She has been a widow at a very young age because her husband died some time after their marriage. That is why Dewi Rara Kuning is then known as Dewi Lanjar. Because of this, Dewi Lanjar decided to leave his hometown to avoid being constantly consumed with grief.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

On arrival at the river Opak, she met the King of Mataram Panembahan Senopati together with Mahapatih Singaranu. Dewi Lanjar expressed her heart and said she would never marry again. Panembahan Senopati and Mahapatih Singoranu, both feeling pity, advised her to go to the South Beach and face [[Nyai Roro Kidul|the Queen of the Southern Sea]]. Then they parted. Dewi Lanjar headed towards the South Beach. He meditated diligently then [[moksa]] and met with Queen of the Southern Sea.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

During the meeting, Dewi Lanjar begged the Queen to be her child which she did not mind. One day, Dewi Lanjar with the [[jinn]] troops was commanded to disrupt and prevent Raden Bahu from opening Gambiren forest (now located around the bridge of Pekalongan and Sorogenen village). However, Raden Bahu was unaffected by the temptations of Dewi Lanjar and the jinn. Unable to fulfill the task, Dewi Lanjar decided not to return to the South Beach, but requested permission to Raden Bahu to be able to reside in Pekalongan. It is approved by both Raden Bahu and even the Queen of Southern Sea. Dewi Lanjar was allowed to stay and rule the North Beach especially in Pekalongan, Central Java.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3142">'''Enmerkar and En-suhgir-ana''' (also known as '''Enmerkar and Ensuhkeshdanna''') is text in [[Sumerian literature]] appearing as a sequel to ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]'', and is second in a series of four accounts describing the contests of [[Aratta]] against [[Enmerkar]], lord of [[Uruk|Unug]] and Kulaba, and his successor [[Lugalbanda]], father of [[Gilgamesh]].

==Synopsis==

The name of the Lord of Aratta, which never appeared in ''Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta'', is here provided in a brief introduction. Among scholars, the earlier cuneiform reading of this name, ''Ensuhgirana'', still enjoys currency alongside the more recent reading of it as ''[[Ensuhkeshdanna]]''.  The introduction also gives the name of Ensuhkeshdanna's chief minister, ''Ansigaria'', and Enmerkar's chief minister, ''Namena-tuma''. Enmerkar is the Lord of both Unug and Kulaba, described as the "city which rises from heaven to earth" [sic].

Following this introduction, the plot opens with Ensuhkeshdanna dictating a message to his envoy, to be taken to Unug, demanding Enmerkar submit to Aratta, and boasting that his connections with the goddess [[Inanna]] are superior to those of Enmerkar.

The envoy having traveled to Unug and delivered this message, Enmerkar responds that Inanna stays at the temple with him, and that she will not even go to Aratta for five or ten years; he responds to Ensuhkeshdanna's boasts with a number of creative sexual taunts of his own ("even though she is not a duckling, she shrieks like one.")

When the messenger returns to Aratta with this message, Ensuhkeshdanna is perplexed and feels defeated.  His counselors advise him to back off from confrontation with Enmerkar.  However, he vows never to submit to Enmerkar, even if Aratta be utterly destroyed.

At this point, a sorcerer named Urgirinuna comes to Aratta, after his homeland of [[Hamazi]] has been vanquished.  Urgirinuna promises the chief minister, Ansigaria, that he can make Enmerkar submit to Aratta.    Ansigaria agrees to fund this mission, and the sorcerer then proceeds to [[Eresh (disambiguation)|Eresh]], the city of [[Nisaba]], where he somehow manages to sabotage the dairy livestock of Enmerkar.

This act of the sorcerer's sabotage was observed by the livestock keepers, Mashgula and Uredina, who then pray to Utu, the sun god, for help. A sorceress of Eresh called "Wise Woman Sagburu" then appears, and outperforms Urgirinuna's sorcery in a series of contests: each time Urgirinuna magically brings an animal from the water by casting in fish eggs, she brings a predator from the water in the same way, which then eats the animals he produces.  Having defeated him with superior magic, she refuses to spare his life, and casts him into the Euphrates.

When Ensuhkeshdanna hears of this, he admits defeat and submits to Enmerkar.  The remainder of the text is too fragmentary to interpret.

The [[Constitution of Lebanon|Constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religion]] and the freedom to practice all [[religious rite]]s provided that the [[public order]] is not disturbed. The Constitution declares equality of rights and duties for all citizens without [[discrimination]] or [[preference]] but establishes a balance of power among the major [[Demographics of Lebanon#Religious groups|religious groups]]. The [[Government of Lebanon|Government]] generally respected these rights; however, there were some restrictions, and the constitutional provision for apportioning political offices according to religious affiliation may be viewed as inherently discriminatory. There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on [[religious belief]] or practice. There were, however, periodic reports of tension between religious groups, attributable to competition for political power, and citizens continued to struggle with the legacy of a 15-year [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] that was fought largely along sectarian lines. Despite sectarian tensions caused by the competition for [[Politics of Lebanon|political power]], [[Church (building)|churches]], [[mosque]]s, and other places of worship continued to exist side-by-side, extending a centuries-long national heritage as a place of refuge for those fleeing religious intolerance.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Lebanon|Secularism in Lebanon|Irreligion in Lebanon|Demographics of Lebanon#Religious groups}}

The [[Lebanon|country]], founded as a modern state in 1943, has a population of over 6 million. Because parity among confessional groups remains a sensitive issue, a national census has not been conducted since 1932. However, the most recent demographic study conducted by Statistics Lebanon, a Beirut-based research firm, found that approximately Lebanon's population is estimated to be 54% [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] (27% [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia]]; 27% [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]]), 5.6% [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]], who do not consider themselves to be Muslims but under the Lebanese political division (Parliament of Lebanon Seat Allocation) the Druze community is designated as one of the five Lebanese Muslim communities (Sunni, Shia, Druze, Alawi, and Ismaili);&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=wXO8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Parliament+of+Lebanon+Seat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XSZVVci7Icz3yQTZhIGYDQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Parliament%20of%20Lebanon%20Seat&amp;f=false Lebanon Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=wXO8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Parliament+of+Lebanon+Seat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XSZVVci7Icz3yQTZhIGYDQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22five%20Muslim%20sects%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; 40.4% [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] (21% [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]], 8% [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]], 5% [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite]], 1% [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestant]] and 4 percent Armenian, 1 percent other Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics Lebanon Beirut-based research firm|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/nea/208400.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also very small numbers of [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Bahai faith|Bahá'ís]], [[Mormonism|Mormons]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and [[Hinduism|Hindus]].

Of the 18 officially recognized religious groups, 4 are Muslim, 12 Christian, 1 Druze, and 1 Jewish. The main branches of Islam are Shi'a and Sunni. The smallest Muslim communities are the Shia offshoots like [[Alawites in Lebanon|Alawites]] and the [[Ismailis in Lebanon|Ismaili]] ("Sevener") Shi'a order. The [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] community, by far the largest Christian group, has had a centuries-long affiliation with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] but has its own [[patriarch]], [[liturgy]], and ecclesiastical customs. The second largest Christian group is the [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox Church]] who maintain a [[Greek language|Greek-language]] liturgy. Other Lebanese Christians are also [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite Catholic]]s, [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestant Christians]] like [[evangelicalism|evangelical]]s (including [[Protestant]] groups such as the [[Baptists]] and [[Seventh-day Adventists]]), and [[Roman Catholicism in Lebanon|Latins]] ([[Roman Catholic]]). Other non-native to Lebanon Christian groups are divided among [[Armenian Orthodox]] (Gregorians), [[Armenian Catholic]]s, [[Syriac Orthodox]] ([[West Syriac Rite|Jacobites]]), [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholics]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]s ([[Nestorianism|Nestorians]]), [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean]], and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Copts]]. The [[Druze in Lebanon|Lebanese Druze]], who refer to themselves as al-Muwahhideen, or "believers in one God," are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas east and south of Beirut. Divisions and rivalries between various groups date back many centuries, and while relationships between religious adherents of different confessions were generally amicable, group identity was highly significant in most aspects of cultural interaction.

Foreign missionaries present in the country operated missions, schools, hospitals, and places of worship.

Many persons fleeing religious mistreatment and discrimination in neighboring states have immigrated to the country, including [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurds]], [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shi'a]], and [[Assyrians in Iraq|Assyrians/Chaldeans]] from [[Iraq]], as well as [[Copts]] from [[Copts in Egypt|Egypt]], [[Copts in Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Copts in Libya|Libya]]. Precise figures were unavailable due to the lack of census data and the tendency of these groups to assimilate into the culture.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the freedom to practice all religious rites provided that public order is not disturbed. The Constitution requires the state to respect all religions and denominations and guarantee respect for the personal status and religious interests of persons of every religious sect. The Constitution declares equality of rights and duties for all citizens without discrimination or preference but stipulates a balance of power distributed among the major religious groups. The Government generally respected these rights in practice; however, there were some restrictions, and the constitutional provision for apportioning political offices according to religious affiliation may be viewed as inherently discriminatory.

The Government permits recognized religious groups to exercise authority over matters pertaining to personal status, such as [[marriage]], [[divorce]], [[child custody]], and [[inheritance]]. The "Twelver" Shi'a, Sunni, Christian, and Druze confessions have state-appointed, government-subsidized clerical courts that administer family and personal status law.

The Constitution provides that [[Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanese Christians]] and [[Islam in Lebanon|Lebanese Muslims]] be represented equally in [[Parliament of Lebanon|Parliament]], the [[Cabinet of Lebanon|Cabinet]], and high-level civil service positions, which include the ministry ranks of Secretary General and Director General. It also provides that these posts be distributed proportionally among the recognized religious groups. The constitutional provision for the distribution of political power and positions according to the principle of religious representation is designed to prevent a dominant position being gained by any one confessional group. The "National Pact" of 1943 stipulates that the president, prime minister, and speaker of parliament be Maronite Christian, Sunni Muslim, and Shi'a Muslim, respectively. This distribution of political power functions at both the national and local levels of government.

The 1989 [[Taif Agreement]], which ended the country's 15-year civil war, reaffirmed this arrangement but, significantly, mandated increased Muslim representation in Parliament so that it would be equal to that of the Christian community and reduced the power of the Christian Maronite presidency. In addition, the Taif Agreement, which concluded the country's 15-year civil war, endorsed the constitutional provision of appointing most senior government officials according to religious affiliation. This practice is operative in all three branches of government. The Taif Agreement also stipulated a cabinet with power equally allocated between Muslims and Christians. The political establishment has been reluctant to change this "confessional" system, because citizens perceive it as critical to the country's stability.

Formal recognition by the Government is a legal requirement for religious groups to conduct most religious activities. A group that seeks official recognition must submit a statement of its doctrine and moral principles for government review to ensure that such principles do not contradict popular values or the Constitution. The group must ensure that the number of its adherents is sufficient to maintain its continuity.

Alternatively, religious groups may apply for recognition through recognized religious groups. Official recognition conveys certain benefits, such as tax-exempt status and the right to apply the religion's codes to personal status matters. An individual may change religions if the head of the religious group the person wishes to join approves of this change. Refusal is not reported to occur in practice. Religion is encoded on national identity cards and noted on [[ikhraaj qaid]] (official registry) documents, and the Government complies with requests of citizens to change their civil records to reflect their new religious status.

Some religious groups do not enjoy official recognition, such as Bahá'ís, Buddhists, Hindus, and unregistered Protestant Christian groups. They are disadvantaged under the law in that their members do not qualify for certain government positions, but they are permitted to perform their religious rites freely. For example, a Bahá'í cannot run for Parliament as a Bahá'í candidate because there is no seat allocated for the confession, nor could such an individual hold senior positions in the Government, as these are also allocated on a confessional basis. However, a number of members of unregistered religious groups are recorded under the recognized religions. For example, most Bahá'ís are registered under the Shi'a sect. As such, a member of the Bahá'í community can run for office and fill a seat allocated to the Shi'a sect. Similarly, Mormons are registered under the Greek Orthodox faith. Government decisions on granting official recognition of religious groups do not appear to be arbitrary.

The Government permits the publication in different languages of religious materials of every registered religion.

The Government recognizes the following holy days as national holidays: [[Armenian Christmas]], [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Saint Maroun|St. Maroun Day]], [[Islamic New Year]], [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], [[Good Friday]], [[Easter]] (both Western and Eastern rites), the [[birth of the Prophet Muhammad]], [[All Saints' Day]], [[Feast of the Assumption]], [[Eid al-Fitr]], and [[Christmas]]. The Government also excuses Armenian public sector employees from work on [[Saint Vartan|St. Vartan Day]].

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
The 1989 Ta'if Agreement called for the eventual elimination of political sectarianism in favor of "expertise and competence;" however, little progress has been made in this regard.

Unrecognized groups, such as Bahá'ís, Buddhists, Hindus, and some evangelical denominations, may own property and assemble for worship without government interference; however, they are disadvantaged under the law because legally they may not marry, divorce, or inherit property in the country. [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestant evangelical churches]] are required to register with the [[Evangelical Synod]], a nongovernmental advisory group that represents those churches with the Government. It is self-governing and oversees religious matters for Protestant congregations. Representatives of some churches have complained that the Synod has refused to accept new Protestant groups into its membership since 1975, thereby crippling their clergy's ability to minister to the members of those communities.

Many families have relatives who belong to different religious communities, and intermarriage is not uncommon; however, intermarriage is difficult to arrange in practice between members of some groups. Shari'a, which applies to personal status matters of Muslims, forbids the marriage of a non-Muslim male to a Muslim woman. Druze religious leaders will perform marriages only of Druze couples. There are no procedures for [[civil marriage]]; however, the Government recognizes civil marriage ceremonies performed outside the country.

Proselytizing (or converting people to another religion), while it is not punishable by law, it is strongly discouraged by religious leaders and communities, sometimes with the threat of violence. The respective sect's leadership councils make appointments to senior clerical posts. For example, the nomination of [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]] and [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shi'a]] muftis is officially endorsed by the Government's Council of Ministers, and they receive monthly salaries from the Government. The Government appoints and pays the salaries of Muslim and Druze ecclesiastical judges. The leaders of other religious groups, such as [[Roman Catholicism in Lebanon|Roman Catholics]] and [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]], do not receive salaries from the Government.

The Government does not require citizens' religious affiliations to be indicated on their passports; however, religious affiliation is encoded on national identity cards and noted on ikhraaj qaid documents. The ikhraj qaid, a civil document that indicates personal status information, can be presented by citizens instead of an identity card when they apply for various purposes, such as to obtain government employment or to enroll in or be employed at a university.

In most cases religious groups administer their own family and personal status laws. Many of these laws discriminate against women. For example, Sunni inheritance law provides a son twice the inheritance of a daughter. Although Muslim men may divorce easily, Muslim women may do so only with the concurrence of their husbands.

Article 473 of the [[Penal Code of Lebanon]] stipulates a maximum prison term of 1 year for anyone convicted of "blaspheming God publicly." There were no prosecutions reported under this law during the reporting period.

Students and teachers found to be working while on tourist visas are deemed to have violated their visa status and are consequently deported. The same sanction applies to religious workers not working under the auspices of a government-registered religious organization.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of forced religious conversion within Lebanon.

A permanent search warrant remained in effect for the 2002 killing of an American citizen missionary affiliated with the Christian and Missionary Evangelical Alliance in Sidon, although the case was officially closed in April 2004. Investigations at the time of the killing suggested that Sunni extremists, possibly operating from the nearby Ain al-Hilweh [[Palestinians in Lebanon|Palestinian]] refugee camp, were responsible.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

"'''Good Grief'''" is a song by English [[indie pop]] band [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]]. It was released on 16 June 2016 as the lead single from their second studio album, ''[[Wild World (album)|Wild World]]'' (2016).&lt;ref name="Single Release" /&gt; The song was written by [[Dan Smith (singer)|Dan Smith]], who handled the production along with [[Mark Crew]]. It is their first single released to feature new touring member [[Charlie Barnes (musician)|Charlie Barnes]].

==Background==
On 16 June 2016, [[Annie Mac]] debuted "Good Grief" on her [[BBC Radio 1]] show as the "hottest track." Following the debut, the band released the single to radio and as a digital download.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bastilledan/status/743509294851686400|title=BASTILLE on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Georgia Ivey of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' said that the song was "surprisingly upbeat considering its reflection on the grieving process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/bastille-wild-world|title=Bastille - Wild World|last=Ivey|first=Georgia|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|publisher=Music Republic|date=6 October 2016|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Jamieson of ''[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]'' called the track a tone-appropriate album opener, saying that its "pomp and grandeur juxtaposed perfectly with Dan Smith’s dark-tinged tale of coping with life after death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2016/09/05/bastille-wild-world-album-review|title=Bastille - Wild World|last=Jamieson|first=Sarah|work=[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]|publisher=Sonic Media Group|date=9 September 2016|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NME]]'' writer Charlotte Gunn described it as "a euphoric pop track about death and funerals and being sad, but done Bastille-style, with a massive chorus and an [[The X Factor (UK TV series)|X Factor]]-worthy key change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-bastille-16565|title=Bastille - 'Wild World' Review|last=Gunn|first=Charlotte|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=7 September 2016|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the album, Andy Baber of [[musicOMH]] felt the song was a "misleading introduction" to the record's various political themes, but said that it establishes the band's "move towards the more eclectic approach favoured on their mixtapes – as evidenced by the sampling of [[Kelly Le Brock]] from ‘80s movie ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/bastille-wild-world|title=Bastille – Wild World|last=Baber|first=Andy|publisher=[[musicOMH]]|date=9 September 2016|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==

Groups appear listed alphabetically by country, with the date of their appearance in the respective government report noted in the section header.

The application of the labels "cults" or "sects" to (for example) [[new religious movement|religious movements]] in government documents usually signifies the popular and negative use of the term "cult" in [[English (language)|English]] and a functionally similar use of words translated as "sect" in several European languages.&lt;ref name = "Richardson01"&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[James T. Richardson|Richardson, James T.]] and [[Massimo Introvigne|Introvigne, Massimo]] | year = 2001 | title = 'Brainwashing' Theories in European Parliamentary and Administrative Reports on 'Cults' and 'Sects'  | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–168 | doi=10.1111/0021-8294.00046}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins02"&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Robbins, Thomas]] | year = 2002 | title = Combating 'Cults' and 'Brainwashing' in the United States and Europe: A Comment on Richardson and Introvigne's Report | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–76 | doi=10.1111/0021-8294.00047}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=April 2017}} Government reports which have used these words include ones from Austria,&lt;ref name="unhcr"&gt;

Among the larger groups was the Church of Scientology, with between 5,000 and 6,000 members, and the Unification Church, with approximately 700 adherents throughout the country. Other groups found in the country included Divine Light Mission, Eckankar, Hare Krishna, the Holosophic community, the [[Osho movement]], Sahaja Yoga, Sai Baba, Sri Chinmoy, Transcendental Meditation, Landmark Education, the Center for Experimental Society Formation, Fiat Lux, Universal Life, and The Family."

&lt;/ref&gt;
Canada, China, France, Germany, and Russia. While these documents utilize similar terminology they do not necessarily include the same groups nor is their assessment of these groups based on agreed criteria. Other governments and world bodies also report on new religious movements but do not use these terms to describe them.&lt;ref name = "Richardson01" /&gt;{{qn|date=April 2017}}

==Austria==
The Austrian government does not always distinguish sects in Austria as a separate group. Rather, religious groups are divided into three legal categories: officially recognized religious societies, religious confessional communities, and associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=208288 |title= International Religious Freedom Report for 2012 |publisher= [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |accessdate= 2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the most recent year for which sects were officially distinguished{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} in Austria, the groups included the [[Church of Scientology]], the [[Unification Church]], the [[Divine Light Mission]], [[Eckankar]], [[ISKCON|Hare Krishna]], [[Osho-Rajneesh movement|Osho movement]], [[Sahaja Yoga]], [[Sathya Sai Baba|Sai Baba]], [[Sri Chinmoy]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], [[Uriella|Fiat Lux]], [[Universal Life]], and [[Family International|The Family International]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Canada ==
A [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] report of 1999 discussed "Doomsday Religious Movements espousing hostile beliefs and having the potential to be violent.."  Groups classified as "[[Doomsday cult|Doomsday Religious Movements]]"  included:

* the [[Branch Davidians]]
* Canada's [[Order of the Solar Temple]]
* [[Aum Shinrikyo]] (called the "Aum cult")&lt;ref name="canadianintelligence"&gt;"Doomsday Religious Movements", ''PERSPECTIVES'', 
a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] publication, Report # 2000/03, December 18, 1999. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050213230826/http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/eng/miscdocs/200003_e.html available online], last updated November 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Hate Crimes Unit of the Edmonton Police Service confiscated anti-[[Falun Gong]] materials distributed at the annual conference of the [[American Family Foundation]] by staff members of the Calgary Chinese Consulate (Province of Alberta, Canada). The materials, including the calling of Falun Gong a "cult," were identified as having breached the Criminal Code, which bans the wilful promotion of hatred against identifiable religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://organharvestinvestigation.net/ Edmonton Police Report of Wilful Promotion of Hatred by Chinese Consular Officials against Falun Gong], Appendix 8 to "Bloody Harvest: Revised Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China," By David Matas, Esq. and Hon. David Kilgour, Esq.&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
The General Office of [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China]] maintains a list of "heterodox teachings," (邪教)  entitled "Information Regarding the Organizations Already Identified as Cults."

Among the Christian-based groups listed one of the best known is [[Zhao Weishan]]'s [[Eastern Lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;Jason Kindopp, Carol Lee Hamrin (editors), ''God and Caesar in China'', Brookings Institution Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0815749368}}, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;  The followers of [[Watchman Nee]] (the [[Local Churches]], or original Shouters) are said to be the first group put on the list, in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Bays, ''A New History of Christianity in China,'' Wiley-Blackwell, 2012, {{ISBN|9781405159548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian-based groups on the list include:  The splinter groups of [[Li Changshou]]'s original [[Difang Jiaohui]], known as the [[Huhanpai]] (He Enjie's [[Changshouzhu jiao]], Chinese Shouters), include Zhao Weishan's Eastern Lightning (also Actual God, [[Shijishen]], 实际神), Wu Yangming's [[Beili Wang]] (Established King), and Liu Jiaguo's [[Zhushenjiao|Lord God Sect]]. Other groups unrelated to the Shouters include Hua Xuehe's [[Lingling Sect]], [[Xu Yongze]]'s [[All Scope Church]] or [[Born Again Movement]] (BAM) and its offshoot [[Gong Shengliang]]'s [[Huanan jiaohui]] [[South China Church]], Li Sanbao's [[Mentuhui]] or [[Tudihui]] (Disciples Church), Xu Wenku's [[Sanban Puren Pai]] (Three Ranks of Service), Wu Huanxing's Cold Water Sect (Lengshui jiao), Liang Jiangye's Commune Sect (Fanwugongyongpai), the [[New Testament Church (China)]] founded by Hong Kong movie actress [[Jiang Duanyi]] then led by [[Zhang Lude]] and [[Zuo Kun]] as the Taiwan Apostles Faith Church (Shitu Xinxinhui), the Resurrection Way [[Fuhuodao]] of Guo Guangxu and Wen Qiuhui, as well as offshoots of Korean Christian new religious movements:[[The Unification Church]] of Rev. Moon, [[Dami Evangelism Association]], and the [[World Elijah Evangelism Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenggang Yang, ''Religion in China: Survival and Revival under Communist Rule, 2011, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|9780199735648}}, pages 102-195&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist-based proscribed sects include [[Lu Shengyan]]'s Taiwan-based [[Lingxian Zhenfozong]] (灵仙真佛宗, [[True Buddha School]]), Ching Hai's [[Guanyin Famen]], and Yuandun Famen.&lt;ref&gt;US Commission on International Religious Freedom, 2001, US GPO,  page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Religious freedom in France|Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France|MIVILUDES}}

===French parliamentary commission report (1995)===
In 1995, a parliamentary commission of the [[National Assembly of France]] on cults produced its [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp report]&lt;ref name="france1995"&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp French report, 1995], [http://cftf.com/french/Les_Sectes_en_France/cults.html English translation], [[National Assembly of France]], Parliamentary Commission report.&lt;/ref&gt; (in French: compare an [http://cftf.com/french/Les_Sectes_en_France/cults.html unofficial English translation]). The report included a list of purported cults based upon information which may have been provided by former members, the general information division of the [[French National Police]] (''[[Renseignements généraux]]'' — the French secret police service) and cult-watching groups.&lt;ref&gt;''The New heretics of France'' Susan J. Palmer, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The criteria chosen by the French Renseignements généraux to establish the potential dangers of a movement were criticized since they were considered vague and may include many organizations, religious or not. One of the first criticisms came from bishop [[Jean Vernette]], the national secretary of the French episcopate to the study of cults and new religious movements, who stressed that these criteria can be applied to almost all religions. Moreover, sociologists such as [[Bruno Étienne]] emphasized that the mental manipulation should not be defined by the policemen of the Renseignements généraux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruno |last=Étienne |title=Les sectes en France |publisher=Hachette littératures |year=2002 |language=French |isbn=2-01-235569-2 |page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of cults was based on the criteria defined by the Renseignements généraux, but without specifying which of their practices are specifically criticized. In addition, the secrecy of the work made by the RG led to questions about the presence or absence of certain organizations in the list. Étienne questioned the presence of the CEDIPAC SA company, formerly known as [[European Grouping of Marketing Professionals]] (GEPM), as its activity is not in the religious field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruno |last=Étienne |title=Les sectes en France |publisher=Hachette littératures |year=2002 |language=French |isbn=2-01-235569-2 |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of [[Opus Dei]] or the Freemasons also raised questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruno |last=Étienne |title=Les sectes en France |publisher=Hachette littératures |year=2002 |language=French |isbn=2-01-235569-2 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Raphaël Verrier |title=La loi anti-secte : remède empoisonné d'un mal imaginaire |url=http://lmsi.net/spip.php?article57 |publisher=Les mots sont importants |language=French |date=February 2001 |accessdate=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Yves Bertrand, General Director of the Renseignements généraux from 1992 to 2003, spoke about his collaborative work with the parliamentary reports on cults, and said: "Alongside genuine and dangerous cults practicing removal of school, abuse of weakness or pedophilia, some groups have been a bit quickly dress up of the word cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Yves |last=Bertrand |publisher=Plon |year=1997 |title=Je ne sais rien mais je dirai (presque) tout |language=French |page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, on 27 May 2005, the 1995 list of cults of the French report was officially cancelled and invalidated by [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s circulaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/content/societe/article?id=19641 |title=La fin des listes noires |journal=[[Le Point]] |publisher=Artémis |place=Paris |language=French |date=23 June 2005 |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J.

In France, [[Antoinism]] was classified as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary reports which considered it one of the oldest healer groups.&lt;ref name="AN"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes — "Les sectes en France" |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |publisher =Assemblée Nationale |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 1984 letter, the French [[Minister of the Interior]] wrote that the movement was considered, from an administrative point of view, as having for exclusive purpose the exercise of a religion, thus complying with the 18th and 19th Articles of the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]]. He added that antoinism had always been allowed to receive bequests or donations, which meant that its religious nature was never challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La religion, une anomalie républicaine? |chapter=Chapitre 2: Les enfants dans la tourmente "sectaire" |first=Dominique |last=Kounkou |publisher=L'Harmattan |year=2003 |page=98 |language=French |isbn=2-7475-4094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many anti-cults activists, associations or watchers said they had not noticed cultic deviances in this group. For example, when heard by the Belgian commission on cults, philosopher Luc Nefontaine said that "the establishment of a directory of cult movements (...) seems to him dangerous, because it would also give a bad image of quite honourable organizations such as (...) Antoinism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'Enquête par MM.

They heal through prayer, but as long as they do not prevent people from getting proper treatment by legal means..." In addition, the [[Direction centrale des renseignements généraux|Renseignements généraux]] stopped monitoring the religion given the absence of any problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Faut-il se méfier des fidèles du Culte Antoiniste ? |journal=Le Progrès |place=Loire |edition=Édition du Roannais |first=Justin |last=Mourez |date=23 March 2013 |page=15 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the national service "Pastoral, sects and new beliefs" ("Pastorale, sectes et nouvelles croyances"), which analyses new religious movements from a catholic point of view, wrote about Antoinism: "Although listed among the cults in the 1995 Parliamentary Report, it has no cultish feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://troumad.org/sectes/partie_4/Antoinisme.html |title=L'Antoinisme |author=Pastorale, sectes et nouvelles croyances |publisher=troumad |date=October 2002 |language=French |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the French sociologist [[Régis Dericquebourg]], who deeply studied the religion, concluded that Antoinism is not a cult: it "has no totalitarian influence on its members, and do not dictate their behaviour to get in the world; it is not exclusive [and] shows no hostility towards social systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Les Antoinistes |first=Régis |last=Dericquebourg |authorlink=Régis Dericquebourg |year=1993 |place=Belgium |publisher=Brépols |language=French |page=139 |isbn=978-2-503-50325-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the 1995 parliamentary report listed the [[Shri Ram Chandra Mission]]. This has been criticized by lawyer Lawrence Hincker, who said that "this system of meditation, called Sahaj Marg, does not lead to a life away from the world. It integrates all aspects of man, whether physical, mental or spiritual, without charge or austerity or penance or self-negation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Laurent |last=Hincker |title=Sectes, rumeurs et tribunaux |publisher=La nuée bleue |year=2003 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the sociologist [[Bruno Étienne]], an expert on religious issues, the SRCM publishes books as any other group but does not proselytize, and has never been convicted: "To us, it is fully a NMR (new religious movement), modern religious group, although based on an ancient tradition, and subject to serious arguments advanced by others more knowledgeable, we do not understand why it is criticized on the list of the damned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruno |last=Étienne |title=La France face aux sectes |isbn=2-01-235569-2 |page=86 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raphaël Liogier]], Director of the Observatory of religious and university professor at the [[Institut d'Études Politiques]] in [[Aix-en-Provence]], said he did not understand the inclusion on the cult list of an association that is fully recognized in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcription intégrale de l'interview de Raphaël Liogier |url=http://www.sectes-infos.net/Raphael_Liogier_Transcript_Integral.htm |publisher=Centre d'Information et de Conseil des Nouvelles Spiritualités |date=May 2006 |language=French |accessdate=4 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121204742/http://www.sectes-infos.net/Raphael_Liogier_Transcript_Integral.htm |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the [[Russian Interior Ministry]] prepared a list of "extremist groups".  At the top of the list appeared Islamic groups outside of "traditional Islam", which is supervised by the Russian government. Next listed were [[Neopaganism|"Pagan cults"]].&lt;ref&gt;''The new nobility : the restoration of Russia's security state and the enduring legacy of the KGB'', Author: Andreĭ Soldatov; I Borogan,

In 2009 the [[Russian Ministry of Justice]] set up a council which it named "Council of Experts Conducting State Religious Studies Expert Analysis".  The new council listed 80 large sects which it considered potentially dangerous to Russian society, and mentioned that there were thousands of smaller ones.&lt;ref&gt;

The council was instrumental in expanding the focus of antiextremism activities from Muslim groups to all so-called dangerous sects. While Muslims continued to face severe repression, the Council ominously declared that there were more than eighty 'large' sects operating in Russia, with 'thousands' of smaller sects.

According to [[Church of Scientology]] doctrine, '''Helatrobus''' was an "interplanetary nation", now extinct, which existed [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]]s of years ago.

==Government==
In his ''State of OT'' lecture, Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] described them as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"a little pipsqueak government, didn't amount to very much."'' &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This same description also appears in the ''Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary'' (first edition, pg. 196). The official insignia of Helatrobus was a gold cross, ''"like the [[American Red Cross]] or something of the sort."''

In the HCO Bulletin of April 17, AD13 ("Aircraft Door Goals"), Hubbard states that the total life span of the Helatrobus government was between 52 trillion and 38 trillion years
ago.

==Implants==
Despite Hubbard's description of them as small and insignificant, he attributed to the Helatrobans a set of "[[Implant (Scientology)|implants]]", including the [[Incident (Scientology)#Heaven Implants|Heaven Implants]], given 43 trillion years before the present, (SHSBC tapes 294, 295 and 300 - #s 6305C21, 6305C23
and 6306C11) and the [[Incident (Scientology)#Gorilla Goals|Gorilla Goals]], created ''"between about 319 trillion years ago to about 256 trillion trillion years ago"'' (or 89 trillion trillion years ago, according to a different lecture). ("Routine 3N: Line Plots", HCOB 14 July 1963).

Hubbard also discoursed on another set of "Helatrobus Implants", located "382 trillion years ago to 52 trillion years ago". In a series of lectures, Hubbard gives further detail:

[[Image:Large.mc.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Large Magellanic Cloud]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Planets were surrounded suddenly by radioactive cloud masses. And very often a long time before the planet came under attack from these implant people, waves of radioactive clouds, Magellanic clouds, black and gray, would sweep over and engulf the planet, and it would be living in an atmosphere of radioactivity, which was highly antipathetic to the living beings, bodies, plants, anything else that was on this planet.
And so planetary systems would become engulfed in radioactive masses, gray and black. And the earmarks of such a planetary action was gray and black &amp;ndash; gray towering masses of clouds. These Magellanic clouds would not otherwise have come anywhere near a planetary system.&lt;br /&gt;("State of OT")&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When a planet was engulfed, the Helatrobans attacked it with ''"little orange-colored bombs that would talk"'', and the clouds themselves would speak: ''"And here you'd have a gray cloud going by and it'd be saying, 'Hark! Hark! Hark!' you see? 'Watch out! Look out! Who's there? Who's that?'"''.

People on the planet's surface would be kidnapped using a small capsule ''"placed at will in space. It shot out a large bubble, the being would grab at the bubble or strike at it and be sucked at once into the capsule. Then the capsule would be retracted into an aircraft."'' A victim was implanted for up to six months and the Helatrobans would ''"fix him on a post in a big bunch of stuff ... put him on a post and wobbled him around and ran him through this implant of goals on a little monowheel [sic]. Little monowheel pole trap. And it had the effigy of a body on it.''" ("State of OT").

==Free Zone==
[[Ralph Hilton]], a [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] Scientologist, has been researching Hubbard's teachings about the Helatrobus implants and publishes information about them. The Free Zone Scientologists seek to make Scientology's inner teachings public, and to bypass control of this information by the Church as run today by [[David Miscavige]]. Hilton lists the Helatrobus Implant goals on his website and they include such fundamental things as "To forget", "To remember", and "To Know", but also such specific things as "To be dead", "To be God", "To have entities", and "To be a vampire".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fzint.net/rhilton/helgoals.htm Helatrobus Implant Goals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614171424/http://www.fzint.net/rhilton/helgoals.htm |date=2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific critiques==
Critics have noted many scientific implausibilities connected with the story of Helatrobus. Peter Forde's paper "A Scientific Scrutiny of OT III" (which also covers Scientologists' belief in the ancient galactic ruler [[Xenu]]) analyzes the matter in detail.

Contrary to Hubbard's statements, the [[Magellanic Clouds]] are [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] seemingly orbiting our own [[Milky Way]], and are not clouds at all in any atmospheric sense.  In many of Hubbard's lectures, the term 'Magellanic Clouds' is often a colloquialism for '[[Nebula|interstellar nebula]]'&lt;ref&gt;Saint Hill Special Briefing Course; "The Free Being", L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, Scientology's placing of these events trillions of years ago contradicts the currently accepted [[age of the Universe]] as 13.8 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years.

==Litigation==
The removed "Helatrobus" search result was a page from [[Operation Clambake]] which included audio and transcripts from Hubbard's lectures on this and other ancient alien civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/censored/ Operation Clambake Present: The SECRET Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Clambake subsequently self-censored the page and Google resumed including the censored link without the warning at the bottom of the page.

The '''history of the Jews in Fiji''' is intertwined with the settlement of the [[Fiji]] islands by European explorers and settlers. Most of these settlers arrive in Fiji via Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The population of Fiji is 905,949 (July 2006 estimate) with approximately 60 [[Jew]]s. In addition, there are close to 300 people of Jewish descent living in the Fiji Islands, principally in the capital city of [[Suva]]. There are currently three [[cemeteries]] in Fiji, located in [[Momi (Fiji)|Momi]] (private cemetery), [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau Island]] (Levuka), and Suva (old cemetery) with Jewish inscriptions on the [[tombstones]], dating back to the first Jewish settlers in the 19th century.

== History ==

===19th century===
One of the early settlers was a merchant by the name [[Alexander Schmerrill Bowman]] (Hebrew name Alexander ben Shmuel) who was born on 9 Jan 1847 in [[Schneidemuhle]], [[Prussia]],(modern day [[Pila, Poland|Pila]] in [[Poland]]) and died 1909 in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Bowman was of the firm Bowman and Abrahams of [[Levuka]] and [[Lomaloma]]. When he settled in Levuka, the former Capital of Fiji, he married Sara Annette Solomon on 25 July 1877 in Levuka, Fiji. She was the daughter of Phillip Solomon and Catherine Cohen. She was born 27 September 1857 in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, and died 1915 in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13398907 Trove.nla.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known figure was a 20-year-old Henry Marks who arrived in 1881 from Australia. Marks laid the foundation of what became one of the most extensive commercial enterprises in the Western Pacific.

=== 21st century ===
Until the recent establishment of the Fiji Jewish Association there was little organized activity among the Jewish population. There remains limited religious life among these Jews. The Israeli Embassy holds an annual [[Passover Seder]], which accommodates 50 to 60 people.[[Kosher]] food is imported from Australia.

Israel and Fiji [[Foreign relations of Israel|enjoy full diplomatic relations]]. In May 2002, the then Fiji Prime Minister, [[Laisenia Qarase]], himself of partial Jewish ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vuataki|first1=K.|title=Chapter 32|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=FE_IRx73vucC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=%22Qarase%22+%2B+%22Jewish%22+%2B+%22ancestry%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O0KjCgBnpr&amp;sig=zr2HgKIlOoF7iix-Q0TrXwcwSDk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAGoVChMI4rzd99WPxwIVpOGmCh0h2QBY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Qarase%22%20%2B%20%22Jewish%22%20%2B%20%22ancestry%22&amp;f=false|website=Softly Fiji|accessdate=4 August 2015|page=272|quote="He was from Vanua Balavu in northern Lau and had native Fijian, Tongan, and Jewish ancestry."}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed with the Israeli Ambassador, H. E. [[Ruth Kahanoff]] that the two countries should strengthen their ties though they are so far apart geographically. While there is an Israeli Embassy in Fiji, the Israeli Ambassador in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] represents Israeli interests in Fiji.

==Career==

===Early career===
Seinfeld developed an interest in stand-up comedy after brief stints in college productions. He appeared on open-mic nights at Budd Friedman's Improv Club while attending Queens College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israeliculture.about.com/culture/israeliculture/library/weekly/aa042098.htm|title=Seinfeld's Kibbutz Days|publisher=Israeli Culture|accessdate=May 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010223215641/http://israeliculture.about.com/culture/israeliculture/library/weekly/aa042098.htm|archivedate=February 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation in 1976, he tried out at an open-mic night at New York City's [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]], which led to an appearance in a [[Rodney Dangerfield]] [[HBO]] special.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/64376/Jerry-Seinfeld/biography|title=Jerry Seinfeld |work= = [[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980, he had a small recurring role on the sitcom ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]'', playing Frankie, a mail-delivery boy who had comedy routines that no one wanted to hear. Seinfeld was abruptly fired from the show due to creative differences.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Seinfeld has said that he was not actually told he had been fired until he turned up for the read-through session for an episode and found that there was no script for him.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in "How It Began," a special feature in the Seinfeld Season 1 &amp; 2 DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1981, Seinfeld made a successful appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', impressing [[Johnny Carson|Carson]] and the audience and leading to frequent appearances on that show and others, including ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

On September 5, 1987 his first one-hour special ''[[Stand-Up Confidential]]'' aired live on [[HBO]].

===''Seinfeld''===
{{Main|Seinfeld}}
[[File:Jerry Seinfeld 1992.jpg|thumb|150px|Seinfeld at the 44th Emmy Awards in 1992]]
Seinfeld created ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' with [[Larry David]] in 1988 for [[NBC]]. The show was later renamed ''[[Seinfeld]]'' to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom ''The Marshall Chronicles''. By its fourth season, it had become the most popular and successful sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular [[Television syndication|syndicated]] re-run.

Along with Seinfeld, the show starred ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' veteran [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and experienced actors [[Michael Richards]] and [[Jason Alexander]]. Alexander played George, a caricature of [[Larry David]]. Seinfeld is the only actor to appear in every episode of the show.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Alexander did not appear in "[[The Pen]]"; Julia Louis-Dreyfus did not appear in [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|the pilot]], "[[The Trip, Part 1]]", or "[[The Trip, Part 2]]"; and Michael Richards did not appear in "[[The Chinese Restaurant]]" or "The Pen."&lt;/ref&gt;

Seinfeld has said that his show was influenced by the 1950s sitcom ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. In the "Seinfeld Season 6" DVD set, commenting on the episode "[[The Gymnast]]", Seinfeld cited [[Jean Shepherd]] as an influence, saying, "He really formed my entire comedic sensibility—I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd."

From 2004 to 2007, the former ''Seinfeld'' cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show. Seinfeld provided commentary for multiple episodes.

===Post-''Seinfeld''===
After he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to [[New York City]] to make a comeback with his [[stand-up comedy]] rather than stay in [[Los Angeles]] and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'', which also featured fellow comic [[Orny Adams]] and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines.

In the late 1990s, [[Apple Computer]] came up with the advertising slogan "[[Think different]]" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to "think differently", such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] of ''Seinfeld''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |title=Seinfeld's commercial |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221221/http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jerry Seinfeld (1997).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Seinfeld at the 1996 Emmy Awards]] In 2004 Seinfeld appeared in two commercial [[webisode]]s promoting [[American Express]], titled ''[[The Adventures of Seinfeld &amp; Superman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/30/business/media-business-advertising-seinfeld-superman-join-forces-again-spots-for.html |title=Seinfeld and Superman join forces again in spots for American Express, this time on the Web. |last=Elliott |first=Stuart |publisher=New York Times |date=30 March 2004 |accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these, Seinfeld appeared with a cartoon rendering of [[Superman]], who was referenced in numerous episodes of ''Seinfeld'' as Seinfeld's hero, voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]] (character [[David Puddy]] on ''Seinfeld''). The webisodes were directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and aired briefly on television. Seinfeld and "Superman" were also interviewed by [[Matt Lauer]] in a specially recorded interview for the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show.

On November 18, 2004, Seinfeld appeared at the [[National Museum of American History]] to donate the "puffy shirt" he wore in the ''Seinfeld'' episode [[The Puffy Shirt|of the same name]]. He also gave a speech when presenting the "puffy shirt", saying humorously that "This is the most embarrassing moment of my life."{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

On May 13, 2006, Seinfeld had a cameo appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'' as host Julia Louis-Dreyfus' assassin. Louis-Dreyfus in her opening monologue mentioned the "Seinfeld curse." While talking about how ridiculous the "curse" was, a [[Stage lighting instrument|stage light]] suddenly fell next to her. The camera moved to a [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalk]] above the stage where Seinfeld was standing, holding a large pair of bolt cutters. He angrily muttered, "Damn it!" upset that it did not hit her. Louis-Dreyfus continued to say that she is indeed not cursed.

On February 25, 2007, Seinfeld appeared at the [[79th Academy Awards]] as the presenter for "Best Documentary." Before announcing the nominations, he did a short stand-up comedy routine about the unspoken agreement between movie theater owners and movie patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://deadline.com/2007/02/jerry-seinfeld-auditioning-for-80th-oscars-1493/ |last=Finke |first=Nikki |title=Seinfeld Auditioning To Host 80th Oscars? |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=26 February 2007 |accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2007, Seinfeld made a brief return to NBC, guest-starring as himself in the ''[[30 Rock]]'' episode "[[SeinfeldVision]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=22046 |title=Seinfeld to Guest Star on 30 Rock |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=July 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2008, at the [[80th Academy Awards]], Seinfeld appeared as the [[Voice acting|voice]] of his ''Bee Movie'' animated character Barry, presenting "Best Animated Short." Before announcing the nominees, he showed a montage of film clips featuring bees, saying that they were some of his early work (as Barry).

On June 2, 2008, amidst his spring 2008 tour, Seinfeld performed in his hometown of [[New York City]] for a one-night-only show at the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]] to benefit ''Stand Up for a Cure'', a charity aiding [[lung cancer]] research at [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]].

In August 2008, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Jerry Seinfeld would be the pitchman for [[Windows Vista]], as part of a $300-million advertising campaign by Microsoft. The ads, which were intended to create buzz for Windows in support of the subsequent "I'm a PC" advertisements, began airing in mid-September 2008. They were cut from television after three installments; Microsoft opted to continue with the "I'm a PC" advertisements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coyle|first=Jake|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Aug21/0,4670,MicrosoftSeinfeld,00.html|title=Seinfeld to be pitchman for Microsoft|date=August 21, 2008|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and run the Seinfeld ads on the Microsoft website as a series of longer advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/watchtheads/video/newfamily/ |title=Microsoft Showcase: Watch videos from Microsoft's online video collection |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823054859/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/watchtheads/video/newfamily/ |archivedate=August 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, it was announced that Seinfeld and the entire cast of ''Seinfeld'' would be appearing for a reunion in Larry David's HBO series ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''. The fictional reunion took place in the [[Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|seventh season's]] [[Seinfeld (Curb Your Enthusiasm)|finale]].

Seinfeld appeared on an episode of the [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] original series ''[[Head Case (TV series)|Head Case]]''. As was the case in many of his previous guest appearances on sitcoms, he played himself.

In [[Australia]], Seinfeld appeared on a series of advertisements for the [[Greater Building Society]], a [[building society]] based in [[New South Wales]] and southeastern [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerry Seinfeld joins the Greater |work=Greater Building Society |date=July 9, 2008 |url=http://www.greater.com.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810061600/https://www.greater.com.au/ |archivedate=August 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His appearance in these ads was highly publicized and considered a coup for the society, being the third time Seinfeld had appeared in a television commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jerry Seinfeld films advertisement for Newcastle's Greater Building Society |work=Daily Telegraph |date=July 10, 2009 |url=http://www.news.com.au/business/money/story/0,28323,25759196-5013952,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711062241/http://www.news.com.au/business/money/story/0%2C28323%2C25759196-5013952%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 11, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisements were filmed in Cedarhurst, [[Long Island]], with the street designed to emulate Beaumont Street in [[Hamilton, New South Wales|Hamilton]], where the Greater's head offices are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Greater website has exclusive behind the scenes footage from the commercials starring Jerry Seinfeld |work=Greater Building Society |date=July 13, 2009 |url=http://www.greater.com.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810061600/https://www.greater.com.au/ |archivedate=August 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seinfeld also wrote the scripts for the 15 advertisements that were filmed. The ads largely aired in the Northern New South Wales television market, where the society has most of its branches.

Seinfeld was the first guest on Jay Leno's talk show, ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'', which premiered on September 14, 2009.

Seinfeld was featured on ''Saturday Night Live''{{'}}s [[Weekend Update]] sketch to do the "Really!?!" segment with [[Seth Meyers]]. He executive produced and occasionally starred as a panelist in ''[[The Marriage Ref (U.S. TV series)|The Marriage Ref]]''. On August 30, 2010, Seinfeld made a surprise guest appearance on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', mending the feud the two had in the early '90s.

Seinfeld toured the U.S. in 2011 and made his first stand-up appearance in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 11 years. In July 2011, he was a surprise guest on ''[[The Daily Show]]'', helping [[Jon Stewart]] to suppress his urge to tell "cheap" "Michele Bachmann's husband acts gay" jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |series=The Daily Show |airdate=July 13, 2010|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-july-13-2011/comedy-repression-therapy|title=Matthew Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seinfeld also launched a personal archives website at JerrySeinfeld.com and appeared in the HBO special ''Talking Funny'' with fellow comedians [[Chris Rock]], [[Louis C.K.]], and [[Ricky Gervais]] in the same year.

In 2012 Seinfeld started a Web series, ''[[Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee]]'', in which he would pick up a fellow comedian in a different car each episode and take them out for coffee and conversation. The initial series consisted of ten episodes lasting from 7 to 25 minutes each. Season 2 (2013) had six episodes, with guests including [[Don Rickles]] and [[David Letterman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/ |title=Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee website |publisher=Comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
Seinfeld wrote the book ''[[Seinlanguage]]'', released in 1993. Written as his television show was first rising in popularity, it is primarily an adaptation of his stand-up material. The title comes from an article in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' listing the numerous catchphrases for which the show was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306170,00.html|title=Seinlanguage|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 9, 1993|accessdate=Dec 31, 2013|author=Fretts, Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he wrote the [[children's literature|children's book]] ''[[Halloween (children's book)|Halloween]]''. The book was illustrated by James Bennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Halloween |author=Jerry Seinfeld |others=(Illustrated by James Bennett)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Discovery Channel]] television show ''[[Chasing Classic Cars]]'' claims that Seinfeld owns the first and last air-cooled Porsche 911s produced. The centerpiece is a $700,000 [[Porsche 959]], one of only 337 built. He was not allowed to drive it, because the car was "not [[Street-legal vehicle|street legal]]", which is because U.S. emissions and crash tests were not performed for the model since Porsche refused to donate four Porsche 959s for destruction tests. He imported the car "[[Grey import vehicles|for exhibition purposes]]", on the stipulation that it may never be driven on U.S. roads.&lt;ref name="bannister"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bannister|first=Paul|title=The Comedians|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was made U.S. street legal in 1999 under the "[[Show and Display]]" federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbesautos.com/advice/toptens/billionaire/02-bill_gates.html |title=William Gates III |work=Forbes |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223132219/http://www.forbesautos.com/advice/toptens/billionaire/02-bill_gates.html |archivedate=December 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/ShowDisplay/howtosd072003.html |title=How To Import A Motor Vehicle For Show Or Display |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seinfeld wrote an article for the February 2004 issue of ''[[Automobile Magazine|Automobile]]'', reviewing the [[Porsche Carrera GT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.944fest.com/Media/Jerryskids.html |publisher=''[[Automobile Magazine|Automobile]]'' via 944Fest.com |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[no title available]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |date=February 2004 |accessdate=December 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425053733/http://www.944fest.com/Media/Jerryskids.html |archivedate=April 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Seinfeld was involved in a car accident when the brakes on his 1967 [[Fiat 500]] failed and, to avoid an intersection, he pulled the emergency brake while turning sharply, ultimately causing the car to come to a stop on its side.

In an episode of ''Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee'', Seinfeld stated that he believes that the [[Lamborghini Miura]] is "the most beautiful car ever designed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seinfeld and Chris Rock laugh it up in a Lamborghini Miura|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/07/18/jerry-seinfeld-chris-rock-laugh-in-lamborghini-miura-video/|publisher=Auto Blog|accessdate=December 29, 2014|date=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
JewishGen was founded in 1987 by Susan E. King in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], as a [[Fidonet]] [[Bulletin board system|bulletin board]] with approximately 150 users interested in Jewish genealogy. To access the bulletin board, users dialed into the connection via telephones. Annual donations of $25 were requested to fund the service.&lt;ref name=DOROT-AccessingJewishGen-1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gostin|first1=Ted|title=Accessing the JewishGen Bulletin Board|journal=DOROT|date=Spring 1995|volume=16|issue=3|pages=9–10|url=http://www.jgsny.org/assets/Documents/dorot16-3spring1995.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1989 to 1990, JewishGen moved to the internet as a mailing list and online forum, and was called the Jewish Genealogy Conference.&lt;ref name=Avotaynu-Nu-KingRetires-2008 /&gt;  It was loosely managed by founding members and volunteers that included [[Warren Blatt]], Susan E. King, Bernie Kouchel, [[Gary Mokotoff]], Michael Tobias, and others active in the community.&lt;ref name=Ancestry-GenealogicalComputing-King-2004&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krasner-Khait|first1=Barbara|title=Susan E.

At the end of 2002, King announced that in 2003 JewishGen became an affiliate of the [[Museum of Jewish Heritage]]. In 2005, the [[IAJGS|International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies (IAJGS)]] gave King an IAJGS Achievement Award for her work with JewishGen, citing the organization's worldwide impact.&lt;ref name=IAJGS-King-2005&gt;{{cite web|title=IAJGS Achievement Awards 2005: IAJGS Lifetime Achievement Award: Susan King|url=http://www.iajgs.org/blog/awards/achievement-awards/iajgs-awards-2005/|website=[[IAJGS]]|accessdate=23 October 2015|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, King retired, and JewishGen moved their administrative office to the museum's facilities.&lt;ref name=Avotaynu-Nu-KingRetires-2008 /&gt; 

In 2008, in a partnership with JewishGen, [[Ancestry.com]] took over the data center hosting of the JewishGen computerized assets.&lt;ref name=JewishGen-Ancestry-2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancestry.com and JewishGen Align to Provide More Online Access to Millions of Jewish Historical Documents|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/JewishGen/PR/Ancestry.08.08.htm|website=JewishGen|accessdate=23 October 2015|date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement improved the JewishGen website's performance, which had been problematic, and created a licensing agreement with [[Ancestry.com]] for database access that created a revenue stream for JewishGen.&lt;ref name=Avotaynu-Nu-JewishGenAncestry-2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mokotoff|first1=Gary|title=JewishGen and Ancestry.com Form an Alliance|url=http://www.avotaynu.com/nu/V09N20.htm|accessdate=23 October 2015|work=Nu?

JewishGen's website is designed to provide a simple and easy interface, and is offered as a free public service.&lt;ref name=AncestryMag-Beginning-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krasner-Khait|first1=Barbara|title=Beginning Jewish Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwHmJFw1464C&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;ots=stsbBf01P8&amp;dq=Krasner-Khait%2C%20Barbara.%20Discovering%20your%20Jewish%20ancestors.&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q=Barbara%20Krasner-Khait&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 October 2015|work=[[Ancestry Magazine]]|date=March 2003|pages=34–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,000 active volunteers throughout the world contribute to its ever-growing collection of databases, resources, and search tools. It lists more than 21 million Jewish records, hundreds of translated [[Yizkor Books|yizkor (memorial) books]], research tools, a family finder, educational classes, historical components, and other resources.&lt;ref name=Hamodia-Feature-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burstyn|first1=Rochel|title=Connecting with the Past: Jewish genealogy|work=[[Hamodia|Hamodia Magazine]]|date=3 January 2013|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a user base of over 500,000 registered users worldwide.&lt;ref name=DOROT-WhatsNew-2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stein|first1=Steve|title=What's New on JewishGen?|journal=DOROT|date=14 June 2009|volume=30|issue=4|url=http://www.jgsny.org/assets/Documents/summer2009.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khan Tengri''' ({{lang-kk|Хан Тәңірі}}, حان تأڭئرئ; {{lang-ky|Хан-Теңири}}, حان-تەڭىرى; {{ug|خانتەڭرى}}; {{zh|s=汗腾格里峰|t=汗騰格里峰|p=Hànténggélǐ Fēng}}, [[Xiao'erjing]]: هًا تٍْ قْ لِ فعْ) is a [[mountain]] of the [[Tian Shan]] [[mountain range]]. It is located on the [[China]]&amp;mdash;[[Kyrgyzstan]]&amp;mdash;[[Kazakhstan]] border, east of lake [[Issyk Kul]].  Its geologic elevation is {{convert|6995|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, but its glacial cap rises to {{convert|7010|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. For this reason, in mountaineering circles, including for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Snow Leopard award]] criteria, it is considered a 7,000-metre peak. The name "Khan Tengri" literally means "King Heaven" in Kazakh and possibly references the deity [[Tengri]]. In some other local languages, it is known as ''Khan Tangiri Shyngy'', ''Kan-Too Chokusu'', ''Pik Khan-Tengry'', and ''Hantengri Feng''.

Khan Tengri is the second-highest mountain in the Tian Shan, surpassed only by [[Jengish Chokusu]] (means "Victory peak", formerly known as [[Peak Pobeda]]) (7,439&amp;nbsp;m). Khan Tengri is the highest point in [[Kazakhstan]] and the third-highest peak in Kyrgyzstan, after [[Jengish Chokusu]] (7,439 &amp;nbsp;m) and [[Avicenna Peak]] (7,134&amp;nbsp;m). It is also the world's most northern 7,000-metre peak, notable because peaks of high latitude have a shorter climbing season, generally more severe weather and thinner air.

==Features==
Khan Tengri is a massive marble pyramid, covered in snow and ice. At sunset the marble glows red, giving it the Kazakh/Kyrgyz name ''Кантау/Кан-Тоо'' (blood mountain). Located just across the South [[Engilchek Glacier|Engilchek]] (or Inylchek) glacier, 16&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Jengish Chokusu]], Khan Tengri was originally thought to be the highest peak in the Tian Shan because of its dramatic, steep shape, compared to the massive bulk of Jengish Chokusu. This perception was probably also due to Khan Tengri's visibility across the plains of southern Kazakhstan while Jengish Chokusu remains out of view of civilization. Khan Tengri is the highest peak in the rugged Tengri Tag subrange, also known as the Mustag, that also contains Chapayev Peak (6371 m) and Gorky Peak (6050 m). [[Anatoli Boukreev]] considered Khan Tengri perhaps the world's most beautiful peak because of its geometric ridges and its symmetry.

==History==
[[Image:South Inylchek Base Camp.jpg|thumb|250px|right|South Inylchek Base Camp, at 4,000&amp;nbsp;m on the glacier's southern moraine, looking northwest to Pik Chapaeva and Khan Tengri in the distance]]
[[Image:KyrgyzstanP21-100Som-2002 b.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The peak appears on the Kyrgyz 100 [[Som (currency)|som]] bill]]
Although it is almost 430 m (1,500&amp;nbsp;ft) lower than its neighbor, Khan Tengri was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu was surveyed in 1943 and determined to be higher.

[[Pyotr Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky|Peter Semenov]] was the first European to see the Tengri Tag and its peak, the colossal Khan Tengri (in 1857).&lt;ref&gt;Semenov, Petr Petrovitch. ''Travels in the Tian'-Shan' 1856-1857''. Trans. by Liudmila Gilmour, Colin Thomas and Marcus Wheeler. Edited and annotated by Colin Thomas, pp. 180, 184-185. The Hakluyt Society, London. (1998). {{ISBN|0-904180-60-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ascent of the peak was made in 1931 by Mikhail Pogrebetsky's Ukrainian team by a route from the south (Kyrgyzstan side), then along the west ridge. M. Kuzmin's team made the first ascent from the north (Kazakhstan side) in 1964. Khan Tengri is one of five peaks that a Soviet mountaineer needed to scale to earn the prestigious [[Snow Leopard award]].

Austrian mountaineer and expedition leader [[Toni Dürnberger]] died while descending after having climbed Khan Tengri on 17 August 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HujXbsAXJZM Video in Gedenken an den österreichischen Bergsteiger Toni Dürnberger]&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak appears on the Kyrgyz 100 [[Som (currency)|som]] bill. In 2004, more than a dozen mountaineers were killed in a large avalanche on the Pogrebetsky route, the most popular route on the mountain.

This is a list of '''Polish cardinals'''. It includes all ethnic [[Poles]], living and deceased, who were raised to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by [[pope]]s of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Cardinals are senior officials of the Church who collectively form the [[College of Cardinals]], a body that elects and advises the supreme pontiff.

This list includes cardinals who were born or carried out their pastoral services outside Poland, such as Cardinal [[Kazimierz Świątek]] who was born in Estonia and worked as a bishop in Belarus. People of other ethnic origins who were [[Naturalization|naturalized]] in Poland, such as the 17th-century Hungarian-born Cardinal [[Andrew Bathory|Báthory Endre]], are not included.

Three of the Polish cardinals, namely [[Fryderyk Jagiellończyk]], [[Jan Olbracht Waza]] and [[John II Casimir of Poland|Jan Kazimierz Waza]], were of royal blood. The latter was elected king of Poland after he had renounced his cardinalate. [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] was the only Polish cardinal to be elected pope. As Pope John Paul II, he elevated ten of his compatriots to cardinalate, the largest number of Polish cardinals created by a single pope.

Roughly one out of two Polish cardinals was a bishop of one of Poland's historically two most important episcopal sees: [[Gniezno]], the capital city of Poland until 1034, and [[Kraków]], Poland's capital from 1038 to 1596. All bishops of Kraków since 1890, as well as all [[primate (bishop)|primates]] of Poland (an honorific title traditionally bestowed on the archbishop of Gniezno), since 1919 have been created cardinals.

Cardinals are sorted in chronological order by date of elevation to cardinalate, indicated in the ''Elevated'' column. Cardinals elevated during the same century are marked by the same color on the bar on the left-hand side of the table. The date of elevation is the date of the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] during which a given person was officially proclaimed cardinal by the pope. In some cases, especially in former times, a cardinal may have received the [[Galero|red hat]] after the consistory or never. Those, whose elevation was intended by a pope, but died before the consistory, as well as [[pseudocardinal]]s elevated by [[antipope]]s, are listed in ''italics''.

Two of the cardinals listed here, Jan Olbracht Waza and [[Marian Jaworski]], were elevated ''[[in pectore]]'', which means that their names were kept secret by the pope and revealed only on later consistories. In these cases, the date of elevation is the date of the ''in pectore'' elevation, not the date of the subsequent publication.

Cardinals are technically deacons or priests of [[Rome|Roman]] churches known as ''[[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|tituli]]''. Their ranks (cardinal deacon or cardinal priest; there have been no cardinal bishops of Polish origin) and titular churches are indicated in the ''Cardinal title'' column. The "Other titles" column shows other, especially [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal]], titles held by the given person during his cardinalate.

The ''Conclaves'' column lists all [[Papal conclave|conclaves]], that is papal elections, that took place during a person's cardinalate and indicates whether he participated in a given conclave or not. Since [[Ingravescentem aetatem]] in 1970, cardinals who are 80 years or older at the beginning of a conclave are ineligible to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Pope Paul VI, ''[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P6INGAET.HTM Ingravescentem aetatem]'', 21 November 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ref.'' column provides links to external online references.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10811">[[File:Codex Boreelianus F+ (09), Mk 1.JPG|thumb|180px|A 9th-century [[Gospel of Mark]], from [[Codex Boreelianus]].]]

In [[Biblical criticism]], the '''Messianic Secret''' refers to a motif primarily in the [[Gospel of Mark]] in which Jesus is portrayed as commanding his followers to maintain silence about his Messianic mission.

Part of [[William Wrede]]'s theory involved statements in the [[New Testament]] by [[Jesus]] to demons who recognize his divine nature as well as to his followers not to reveal to others that he is the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name="Wrede"&gt;[[William Wrede]], [https://archive.org/details/dasmessiasgeheim00wred ''Das Messiasgeheimnis in den Evangelien: Zugleich ein Beitrag zum Verständnis des Markusevangeliums''], (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1901); English edition, William Wrede, ''The Messianic Secret'', trans. The Rev'd James C. G. Grieg (Cambridge: James Clarke &amp; Co., 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blevins"&gt;James L. Blevins. ''The Messianic Secret in Markan Research, 1901–1976''. Washington, D. C.: University Press of America, 1981. {{ISBN|978-0-8191-1606-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrede suggested that this theme was not historical but was an addition by the author of Mark. Wrede's broad concept of the Messianic Secret also involved the use of parables by Jesus.&lt;ref name=Dean2 /&gt;

Wrede's theory had an inherent inter-relationship with the hypothesis of [[Markan priority]], which Wrede eventually abandoned, but some of his followers accepted.&lt;ref name=Head /&gt; The theory was strongly criticized in the first years of the 20th century, then gained acceptance in the 1920s; but eventually began to lose support and by the 1970s it no longer existed as Wrede had proposed it.&lt;ref name=Dean2 /&gt;

==New Testament examples==
In the [[New Testament]], Jesus commands silence in many instances.&lt;ref name="Telford"&gt;W. R. Telford. ''The New Testament, a Short Introduction'', pp. 139. Oneworld. Oxford. 2002. {{ISBN|978-1-85168-289-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#8:29|Mark 8:29–30]]:&lt;ref name=Morna /&gt;

29
And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter said to him in reply, “You are the Messiah.”
30
Then he warned them not to tell anyone about him.

Jesus also issues commands of silence after [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]] and healings, e.g. in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#1:43|Mark 1:43–45]] in the cleansing of a leper:&lt;ref name=Morna /&gt;

43
Then, warning him sternly, he dismissed him at once.
44
Then he said to him, “See that you tell no one anything, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed; that will be proof for them.”
45
The man went away and began to publicize the whole matter. He spread the report abroad so that it was impossible for Jesus to enter a town openly. He remained outside in deserted places, and people kept coming to him from everywhere.

The concept, as Wrede used it, also included [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] and secrets of the [[Kingdom of God]] as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#4:11|Mark 4:11]]:&lt;ref name=Dean2 /&gt;

11
* He answered them, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been granted to you. But to those outside everything comes in parables,

==Wrede's theory==
Wrede proposed that the author of Mark invented the notion of secrecy to reduce the tension between [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] beliefs about Jesus being the Messiah, and the non-Messianic nature of his ministry.&lt;ref name="Wrede" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Morna &gt;''Gospel According to St. Mark'' by Morna Dorothy Hooker 2001 {{ISBN|0-8264-6039-9}} pages 66-69&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wrede's notion of secrecy did not simply rely on the commands of Jesus but also involved the "Markan parable theory" of why Jesus spoke in parables.&lt;ref name=Head /&gt;

Wrede recognized the inherent inter-relationship of his approach with the hypothesis of [[Markan priority]] – namely that Mark was written first and influenced the other Gospels. However, after re-examining his initial theory, Wrede suggested that his theory would work best if the Markan priority hypothesis turned out to be false and wrote: "it would be 'most highly desirable' if such a gospel as Mark were not the oldest gospel".&lt;ref name=Head &gt;''Christology and the Synoptic problem'' by Peter M. Head 1997 {{ISBN|0-521-58488-4}} pages 233-235&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the followers of the Messianic Secret hypothesis were later forced to assume Markan priority – an issue that has resulted in various forms of criticism by other scholars.&lt;ref name=Head /&gt;

==Analysis and interpretation==

===Criticism===
Soon after the appearance of the theory in 1901, theologians such as [[William Sanday (theologian)|William Sanday]] and [[Albert Schweitzer]] reacted negatively to it.&lt;ref name=Dean2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Sanday (theologian)|William Sanday]], ''The Life of Christ in Recent Research'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1907).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Schweitzer]], ''Von Reimarus zu Wrede'' (Tubingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1906); English edition, Albert Schweitzer, ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede'', trans. W. Montgomery (New York: Macmillan, 1948).&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, scholarship was strictly divided, although suggestions to bridge a gap between the opposing views were made.&lt;ref name=Head /&gt; Wrede's broad concept of the Messianic Secret also involved the use of [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] by Jesus, and in his criticism Albert Schweitzer called it the weakest element of Wrede's approach.&lt;ref name=Dean2 &gt;''The Christology of Mark's Gospel'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury 1983 {{ISBN|0-8006-2337-1}} pages 2-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Wrede's theory enjoyed its highest level of acceptance in the 1920s, and support for it began to decline thereafter as criticisms of the theory were provided based on multiple new arguments.&lt;ref name=Dean2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus: an historical and theological investigation'' by Jonathan Knight 2004 {{ISBN|0-8264-6981-7}} pages 139-141&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s [[Ulrich Luz]] demonstrated that the commands of silence which Jesus gave to healed persons belonged to a different category from those issued to his disciples.&lt;ref name=Dean2 /&gt; By the mid-1970s the Messianic Secret theory no longer existed as Wrede had proposed it.&lt;ref name=Dean2 /&gt;

Late in the 20th century, criticism of both the motif and the theory continued from a number of other perspectives, e.g. [[Daniel J. Harrington]], a former professor at the Weston Jesuit School of Theology, argued that even the term "Messianic Secret" is a misnomer, has lumped together multiple issues and some of the Biblical terms used have been confused.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Mark, Volume 2'' by John R. Donahue, Daniel J. Harrington 2002 {{ISBN|0-8146-5965-9}} pages 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Eldon Ladd|G. E. Ladd]] , a former Baptist professor at Fuller Theological Seminary, stated that: "The 'Messanic Secret' is a clever theory, but utterly lacking in evidence".&lt;ref&gt;''A theology of the New Testament'' by George Eldon Ladd 1993 {{ISBN|0-8028-0680-5}} pages 178-180&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other explanations===
Other explanations regarding the commands of secrecy issued by Jesus have been proposed, e.g. [[Philology|philological]] explanations based on mistranslations. An example is the explanation suggested by the Exegetic School of [[Madrid]] based on the [[Aramaic primacy]] that Jesus never expressed those ideas, and that they were added as a result of mistranslation of what Jesus said.&lt;ref&gt;José Miguel García. ''Los orígenes históricos del Cristianismo''. Madrid 2007, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no extant copy of this alleged Aramaic original to support this proposal.

The historical explanations generally assume that the Gospel of Mark is historical and that Jesus issued the commands.&lt;ref name="Telford" /&gt; Based on that assumption, various additional theories have been proposed, e.g. that Jesus issued the commands in order not to become a "celebrity" and be able to move about with ease.&lt;ref name="Telford" /&gt;

The theological explanation was proposed by Wrede:&lt;ref name="Wrede" /&gt; it was not yet the proper time for him to be revealed as such. He knew when he had to go to the court and then be crucified. In Mark 8:30 Jesus, "Then strictly warned them that they should tell no one about Him." Jesus' messianic mission cannot be understood apart from the cross, which the disciples did not yet understand (vs. 31–33 and ch. 9 vs. 30–32). This theological explanation is supported by Matthew's explicit link between Pharisaic conspiracy to "destroy" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+12/|title=Matthew 12:14 ESV|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Matthew 12 - ESVBible.org|publisher=Crossway|access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus and the latter's command to his followers "not to make him known."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+12/|title=Matthew 12:16 ESV|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Matthew 12 - ESVBible.org|publisher=Crossway|access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aware of the plot against him, Jesus "withdrew from there" and continued his healing ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+12/|title=Matthew 12:15 ESV|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Matthew 12 - ESVBible.org|publisher=Crossway|access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew goes one step ahead and claims that Jesus' conscious decision to fulfil his ministry by avoiding untimely conflict was a fulfilment of [[Isaiah|Isaiah's]] prophecy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esvbible.org/Isaiah+42/|title=Isaiah 42:1-4 ESV|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Isaiah 42 - ESVBible.org|publisher=Crossway|access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Behold, my [[Servant songs|servant]] whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. ... He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory; and in his name the Gentiles will hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+12/|title=Matthew 12:18-21 ESV|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Matthew 12 - ESVBible.org|publisher=Crossway|access-date=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The literary explanation theory has it that Mark made a conscious effort to identify Jesus with [[Odysseus]], a Greek hero with whom Mark's [[gentile]] audience would certainly have been familiar. Odysseus, on his return home, has to disguise his identity to avoid his enemies, and in Mark the messianic secret could serve the same purpose for Jesus.

In 1986 the Mount Zion Foundation was created by the German Reverend Wilhelm Salberg (1925–1996), son of a Jewish father and a Christian mother. Every other year, this foundation grants the Mount Zion Award to persons of Jewish, Muslim or Christian faith, who have significantly contributed to the Jewish-Christian [[Interfaith dialog|dialogue]] or to the understanding of the three Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, in Israel.

The presidents of the foundation, Prof. Dr. Verena Lenzen, director of the Institute for Jewish-Christian Research at the University of Lucerne, and the abbot of the [[Hagia Maria Sion Abbey|Dormition Abbey]] in [[Jerusalem]] Bernhard Maria Alter OSB, present the Mount Zion Award always at the end of October, in remebrance of the Declaration on the Relation of the Catholic Church with Non-Christian Religions ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' of October 28, 1965.

The '''Munda people''' ([[Hindi]]: मुंडा,  [[Assamese language|Assamese]]: মুণ্ডা, [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: মুন্ডা) are an [[Adivasi]] ethnic group of [[India]]. They speak the [[Mundari language]], which belongs to the [[Munda languages|Munda subgroup]] of [[Austroasiatic languages]]. The Munda are found in the northern areas of east India concentrated in the states of [[Jharkhand]], [[Odisha]] and [[West Bengal]]. Munda also reside in adjacent areas of [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] as well as in portions of [[Bangladesh]]. The group is one of India's largest [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|scheduled tribes]].
Munda people in [[Tripura]] are also known as Mura, and in [[Madhya Pradesh]] they are often called Mudas.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribesindia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=792&amp;Itemid=104&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The prehistory of the Munda peoples is obscure. Although how they got to the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] is disputed, it is agreed upon that the ancestors of speakers of the modern-day [[Munda languages]] migrated westward from the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] homeland of continental [[Southeast Asia]].

According to [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R.S. Sharma]], a historian of ancient and early medieval India, many Munda, Dravidian and non-Sanskrit terms occur in Vedic texts ascribed to 1500-500 BCE. They indicate ideas, institutions, products and settlements associated with peninsular and non-Vedic India. Similarly, many [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] terms, signifying ideas and institutions developed in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], appear in the earliest [[Tamil language|Tamil]] texts called the [[Sangam literature]], which was created from 300 BCE to 600 CE. The eastern region, inhabited by the [[Munda peoples|Munda]], people made its own contribution. Several terms that signify the use of cotton, navigation, digging, sticks, etc. in the Indo-Aryan languages have been traced back to the [[Munda languages]]. It is held that changes in the phonetics and vocabulary of the Vedic language can be explained by contact with both [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Dravidian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India's Ancient Past|last=Sharma|first=R.S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780199087860|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800's, the [[British Raj]] and many non-Mundas were grabbing land traditionally occupied by Mundas, forcing the Mundas to work as bonded labourers. Munda freedom fighter [[Birsa Munda]] began the first protest marches calling for remission of forest dues. He worked to unify the [[Adivasi]]s of [[Chota Nagpur Plateau|Chota Nagpur]] resist British rule of India. [[Millenarianism]] in the [[India tribal belt|tribal belt]] started with him, and he is still revered in [[Jharkhand]], with villagers in his home village worshipping him as Birsa Bhagawan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jharkhand-amit-shah-launches-scheme-for-villages-of-freedom-fighters-khunti-4848635/|title=Jharkhand: Amit Shah launches scheme for villages of freedom fighters|last=Pandey|first=Prashant|date=2017-09-18|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture &amp; tradition== 
The Munda people probably descended from Austroasiatic migrants from Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Riccio et al. (2011), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21740156 ''The Austroasiatic Munda population from India and Its enigmatic origin: a HLA diversity study''].&lt;/ref&gt; Nomadic hunters in the [[India tribal belt]], they became farmers who were employed in basketwork and weaving. With the listing of the Munda people as Scheduled Tribes (Adivasis), many are employed in various governmental organizations (particularly [[Indian Railways]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Schedule Castes |publisher=Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India |year=2011 |url=http://socialjustice.nic.in/aboutdivision1.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923060507/http://socialjustice.nic.in/aboutdivision1.php |archivedate=23 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Encyclopedia mundarica (John-Baptist Hoffmann).JPG|thumb|alt=Eight books on a shelf|upright=1.2|Part of [[John-Baptist Hoffmann]]'s 15-volume ''Encyclopaedia Mundarica'']]
Munda religion is a blend of [[Sarnaism]] and Christianity, and they are not part of the [[Indian caste system]]. Although the Mundas have preserved much of their pre-Christian culture, they have absorbed a number of Christian traditions. They have many [[folk songs]], [[dance]]s, [[Narrative|tales]] and traditional [[musical instruments]]. Both sexes participate in dances at social events and festivals. The [[naqareh]] is a principal musical instrument.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The Munda people have elaborate rituals to celebrate birth, death, engagement and marriage. The birth of a boy is celebrated as an earner for the family, and the birth of a girl is celebrated as a family caretaker. ''Lota-pani'' is the engagement ceremony. ''Dali Takka'', a monetary gift to paternal guardians, is generally paid before the marriage. Marriage, considered one of the main rituals of life, is a week-long festivity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

An ointment of scented oil and turmeric is applied to the face and body after death. Widow marriage is common. The Munda people are patrilineal, [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]] and patriarchal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weK7KuCvNiQC|title=Land and People of Indian States and Union Territories: In 36 Volumes. Jharkhand|last=Bhatt|first=Shankarlal C.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788178353685|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involved in agriculture, the Munda people celebrate the seasonal festivals of [[Mage Parab]], Phagu, [[Karam (festival)]], [[Baha parab]], [[Sarhul]] and [[Sohrai]]. Some seasonal festivals have coincided with religious festivals, but their original meaning remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoindia.com/tribes/munda.html|title=Mundas, Munda Tribe in Jharkhand India, Occupation of Mundas|website=www.ecoindia.com|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munda people of Jharkhand  also follow the old age tradition of Patthalgari i.e. stone erection in which the tribal community residing in the village buries a large inverted u shaped dressed headstone on the head side of grave or entrance of village in which is inscribed the family tree of the dead persons.&lt;ref&gt;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/20515/11/11_chapter%205.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are some other types of patthalgari also:-
*[[Horadiri]] - It is the stone in which family tree is written.
*[[Chalpadiri]] or [[Saasandiri]] - It is the stone in remarking boundary of any village and its limits.
*[[Magodiri]] - This is the headstone of social criminal who committed polygamy or unsocial marriage.
*[[Ziddiri]] - This is the stone placed on over burial of placenta and dried naval part of a newborn. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/mendaly352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://scroll.in/article/878468/the-constitution-set-in-stone-adivasis-in-jharkhand-are-using-an-old-tradition-as-a-novel-protest&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and studies==
[[Jesuit]] priest John-Baptist Hoffmann (1857–1928) studied the language, customs, religion and life of the Munda people, publishing the first [[Mundari language]] grammar in 1903.  With the help of Menas Orea, Hoffmann published the 15-volume ''Encyclopaedia mundarica''. The first edition was published posthumously in 1937, and a third edition was published in 1976. ''The Mundas and Their Country'', by S. C. Roy, was published in 1912. ''Adidharam'' (Hindi:आदि धर्म) by Ram Dayal Munda and Ratan Singh Manki, in Mundari with a [[Hindi]] translation, describes Munda rituals and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribalstuffs.blogspot.in/2011/11/mundari-language-of-munda-tribe.html|title=Mundari: The Language of Munda Tribe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Norito'''|祝詞}} are [[Liturgy|liturgical]] texts or ritual incantations in [[Shinto]], usually addressed to a given ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philippi|first=Donald L.|title=Norito: A Translation of the Ancient Japanese Ritual Prayers|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691014892|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norito|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/norito|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Motosawa|first1=Masafumi|title=Norito|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1246|website=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

There is no single accepted universally accepted theory to explain the meaning of the term.&lt;ref name="Philippi2"&gt;Philippi (1990). p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; One theory derives ''norito'' from ''noru'' ([[wikt:宣#Kanji|宣る]], 'to declare'; cf. the verbs ''[[wikt:祈る|inoru]]'' 'to pray' and ''[[wikt:呪う|norou]]'' 'to curse'&lt;ref name="Philippi2" /&gt;) - combined with the suffix ''-to''.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto" /&gt; A variant term, ''notto'', is derived from a combination of ''norito'' with ''koto'', 'word'.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto" /&gt;

There are various known ways of writing the word in [[kanji]]: aside from 祝詞 (currently the standard), 詔戸言, 詔刀言, and 諄辞 are also attested.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto" /&gt;

One recent writer summed up the original meaning of ''norito'' as "a general term meaning [[Kotodama|magic by means of words]]."&lt;ref&gt;Shiraishi, Mitsukuni, cited in Philippi (1990). p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first written documentation of ''norito'' dates to 712 CE in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and 720 CE in the ''[[Nihongi]]''.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaShinto" /&gt;

The [[Engishiki]], a compilation of laws and minute regulation presented by the court compiled in 927 CE, preserves twenty-seven representative forms of ''norito''.&lt;ref&gt;Philippi (1990). p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitagawa|first1=Joseph Mitsuo|title=On Understanding Japanese Religion|date=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691102290|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1xcc4cGL5cC&amp;pg=PA67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading==

''Norito'' were (and still are) traditionally written in a variety of ''[[man'yōgana]]'' where [[Japanese particles|particles]] and suffixes are written in a smaller script than the main body of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sinor|editor1-first=Denis|title=American Oriental Society, Middle West Branch, Semi-Centennial Volume: A Collection of Original Essays|date=1969|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=242-243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGEDAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of writing, used in imperial edicts (宣命 ''senmyō'') preserved in the ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'' and other texts dating from the 8th century ([[Nara period]]), is known as ''senmyōgaki''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seeley|first1=Christopher|title=A History of Writing in Japan|date=1991|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004090811|pages=54-55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCZ2ya6cg88C&amp;pg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of the Fields''' (Italian: ''Madonna dei Campi''; French: ''Notre Dame des Champs''; Spanish: ''La Virgen del Campo''; also known as '''Our Lady of Prayer''') is a title of [[Mary mother of Jesus]] in [[Roman Catholic]] [[Marian veneration]].
The name is based on a sanctuary in the countryside of [[Stezzano]], near [[Bergamo]], where [[Marian apparition]]s have been recorded since the 13th century.

Veneration of Mary under this name was taken to [[Canada]] by Jesuit [[Xavier Donald Macleod]], who reports a Marian apparition in a village of [[New France]] in 1841.

Mary is venerated under this name by the [[Glenmary Home Missioners]], a Catholic society of priests and brothers that serve the rural United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glenmary.org/site/epage/97280_919.htm|title=Our Lady of the Fields Prayer - Glenmary|website=www.glenmary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Overcoming Life's Disappointments''''' ({{ISBN|1-4000-3336-5}}) is a 2006 book by [[Harold Kushner]], a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[rabbi]].  Kushner addresses in the book the question of how to cope when disappointing things happen to you. He uses Biblical examples, such as how Moses coped with being denied entrance to The Promised Land, as well as secular examples, such as how Abraham Lincoln coped with depression. The emphasis is on the common disappointments faced by many throughout life, such as the breakup of a marriage, death of a loved one, loss of a job, or financial reversals.

Rabbi Kushner's book was a ''New York Times'' bestseller for many months in the "nonfiction" category.

{{Politics of Poland}}
The '''Polish People's Party–Peasants' Agreement''' ({{lang-pl|Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe–Porozumienie Ludowe}}, PSL-PL) was a Christian agrarian political party in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry Diamond (1997) ''Consolidating the Third Wave Democracies, Volume 1'', JHU Press, p126&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The party was established in October 1991 by a merger of [[Rural Solidarity]] and Polish People's Party–Solidarity, the latter a splinter group from the former.&lt;ref name=HDP&gt;Piotr Wróbel (2014) ''Historical Dictionary of Poland 1945-1996'', Routledge, p248&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Polish parliamentary election, 1991|parliamentary elections]] later that year it received 5.5% of the vote, winning 28 seats in the [[Sejm]] and five in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]].&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', pp1511–1513 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It joined the coalition governments headed by [[Jan Olszewski]] and [[Hanna Suchocka]], with party leader [[Gabriel Janowski]] serving as Minister of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=HDP/&gt;

In spring 1993 the party left the government in protest at a lack of support for agriculture. Due to several splits and internal disagreements, the [[Polish parliamentary election, 1993|September 1993 elections]] saw the party's vote share fall to 2.4%. As it had failed to pass the 5% electoral threshold, it lost all its parliamentary representation. Following the elections the party disintegrated,&lt;ref name=HDP/&gt; although it was part of [[Solidarity Electoral Action]] in the [[Polish parliamentary election, 1997|1997 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Andrzej Szczerbiak (1989) ''The emergence and development of political parties in post-Communist Poland'' University of London&lt;/ref&gt; At a party congress on 15 January 1999 it was decided to merge into [[Ruch Społeczny]].

'''Prayopavesa''' ({{lang-sa|प्रायोपवेशनम्}}, literally ''resolving to die through fasting'')&lt;ref&gt;

== Conditions and rules ==
Committing Prayopavesa is bound by very strict regulations. Only a person who has no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in life is entitled to perform it. The decision to do so must be publicly declared well in advance.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Ancient lawmakers stipulated the conditions that allow Prayopavesa. They are one's inability to perform normal bodily purification, death appears imminent or the condition is so bad that life's pleasures are nil and the action is done under community regulation.&lt;ref name="Subramuniyaswami"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Subramuniyaswami| first = Sivaya| title = Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism| publisher = Himalayan Academy Publications| year = 2003| page = 833| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EWlHPAkjBKUC&amp;pg=PA833| isbn = 978-0-945497-96-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
It was when the king [[Parikshit]] was observing prayopavesa, that the [[Bhagavata Purana]] was narrated to him by the sage [[Śuka]], son of [[Vyasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Shastri| first1 = Jagdish| last2 = Kunst| first2 = Arnold|title = Ancient Indian Tradition &amp; Mythology;: The Bhāgavata-purāṇa| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass| year = 1979| page = 73,74,75| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C8YNAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1982, [[Acharya]] [[Vinoba Bhave]] (spiritual successor of Mahatma Gandhi) died by prayopavesa. [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] also apoted for [[Parikshit]]. 
In November 2001, [[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] subjected himself to prayopavesa. Subramuniyaswami was diagnosed to be suffering from  [[Terminal illness|terminal]] intestinal cancer. He later died on the 32nd day of his fast.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

He was the father of [[Amulius]] and [[Numitor]] and the great grandfather of [[Romulus|Romulus and Remus]], Rome's legendary founders..&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]] VI, 767; [[Livy]] I, 3, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The name==
The names of the Alban kings are based on [[toponym]]s around Rome, or rationalize the connection of mythical figures with the early [[history of Rome]]. The fabricated genealogies in which they appear reflect the desire of status-seeking [[gens|families]] in the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC - 30 BC)|Late Republic]] to lay claim to [[Troy|Trojan]] ancestry. The name ''Procas'' or ''Proca'' may be related to the mythological figure Prochyte, a kinswoman of [[Aeneas]]&lt;ref&gt;Gary D. Farney, ''Ethnic Identity and Aristocratic Competition in Republican Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; who died when the fleet carrying the refugees of [[Troy]] to Italy was within sight of the coast. She was buried on the island that bore her name.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'' (Blackwell, 1986, 1996), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">''Radhashtami''' is a [[Hindu]] holy day commemorating the birth anniversary of [[Radha]] the life energy of [[Vishnu]]. On this day she emerged from a lotus flower as the lover-consort of the lord [[Krishna]] the eighth avatar of lord [[Vishnu]]. It is celebrated mainly by devotees of Krishna.

Traditionally, followers of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] will follow a half-day [[Fasting|fast]] on this day. Like [[Ekadashi]], some devotees observe this fast for full day &amp; some even without water. The holiday is an important holiday for followers of the [[Nimbarka sampradaya]]. On this day, devotees of Krishna ask Radha for her favour, in turn acquire Krishna's grace.

Radhashtami is ceremoniously celebrated in the Brij area. On Radhastami, [[Radha Krishna]] icons are traditionally dressed entirely in flowers. Additionally, Radhashtami is the only day on which devotees may receive [[Darśana|darshan]] of Radha's feet. On all other days, they remain covered.

Devotees will fast until noon and sing devotional songs in praise of the divine couple and their pastimes. Then a feast is served, most often including the Radha Red — a spicy, plum [[chutney]]. 

The 2018 date is 17 September (Monday).&lt;ref&gt;2018 Radhashtami Date for Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh[https://www.drikpanchang.com/festivals/radha-ashtami/radha-ashtami-date-time.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newvrindaban.com/radhastami/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

Radhaashtami is particularly important for the holy pilgrimage to [[Manimahesh Lake]], called 'Manimahesh [[Yatra]]', which is sponsored by the Government of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. It is preceded by the "holy chhari", (holy stick carried by the pilgrims on their shoulders). The pilgrims barefooted, singing and dancing to the hymns of God [[Shiva]], undertake this trek of 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) from the nearest road point of Hadsar&lt;ref&gt;Village Hadsar in [[Chamba district]] [http://wikiedit.org/India/Hadsar/818/]&lt;/ref&gt;, to the Manimahesh Lake.

According to the most recent census conducted by the National Institute of Statistics in 2007, 56.1% of the population of [[Mozambique]] were [[Christian]], 17.9% were [[Muslim]] (mainly [[Sunni]]), 18.7% had no religion, and 7.3% adhered to other beliefs.&lt;ref name="The World Factbook - Mozambique"/&gt; These figures need to be used with caution, especially those for the population that is categorised as having no religion, a significant section of whom is likely to practice traditional animist beliefs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Eric Morier-Genoud, “Renouveau religieux et politique au Mozambique: entre permanence, rupture et historicité”, ''Politique africaine'', n°134, June 2014, pp.155-177&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious communities are dispersed throughout the country.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148708.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Mozambique]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;  The northern provinces are predominantly Muslim, particularly along the coastal strip, but some areas of the northern interior have a stronger concentration of Protestant or Catholic communities.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Protestants and Catholics are generally more numerous in the southern and central regions, but Muslim minority populations are also present in these areas.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The National Directorate of Religious Affairs in the Ministry of Justice states [[evangelical Christians]] represent the fastest growing religious group in the country.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Generally religious communities tend to draw their members from across ethnic, political, economic, and racial lines.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

There are 732 [[religious denominations]] and 144 religious organizations registered with the Department of Religious Affairs of the Ministry of Justice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; During the reporting period 10 denominations and 20 religious organizations were registered.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Major Christian religious groups include [[Anglican]], [[Baptist]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[Congregational]], [[Christadelphians]], [[Methodist]], [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], and [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], as well as [[evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|apostolic]], and [[Pentecostal]] churches.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Many small, independent Protestant and Catholic churches that have split from mainstream denominations fuse African traditional beliefs and practices within a Christian framework.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The overwhelming majority of Muslims are [[Sunni]] belonging to [[Shafi]] school of [[jurisprudence]] influenced with [[Sufism]], with a tiny [[Shi'a]] minority (a few families) principally of South Asian origin.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The growing South Asian immigrant population is predominantly [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] and follows the [[Hanafi school]] of Islamic [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The three principal Islamic organizations are the Islamic Congress, the Islamic Council, and the [Asian] Muslim Community.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The Kuwaiti-funded and Sudanese-managed nongovernmental organization (NGO) African Muslim Agency conducted [[humanitarian]] work, as did the Muslim development agency Aga Khan.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

[[Jewish]], [[Hindu]], and [[Bahá'í Faith]] groups are registered and constitute a very small percentage of the population.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The country's leading [[mosques]] and the Catholic Church have tried to eliminate some traditional indigenous practices from their places of worship, instituting practices that reflect a stricter interpretation of sacred texts; however, some Christian and Muslim adherents continue to incorporate traditional practices and rituals, and religious authorities have generally been permissive of such practices.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Foreign [[missionary]] groups operate freely in the country.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Some groups offer religious teaching centers to their local communities, while others provide scholarships for students to study in their respective countries.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the Government generally respects this right in practice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

==Anti-Religious Campaign 1979-1982==
The ruling party of Mozambique since independence, known as [[Frelimo]], became predominantly [[Marxist]] during the [[Mozambican War of Independence|liberation war]]. After independence, it declared [[state atheism]] and it nationalized all schools and health facilities, until then owned and run in their majority by religious institutions. Faced by resistance, the [[Communist Mozambique|new state]] imprisoned some clerics in 1975 and 1976 and banned all Jehovah's Witnesses to a district in Zambezia in 1977.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eric morier-Genoud, “Of God and Caesar: The Relation between Christian Churches and the State in post-Colonial Mozambique, 1974-1981”, ''Le Fait Missionnaire ''(Lausanne), n°3, September 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dw.de/as-feridas-abertas-pelo-processo-de-reeducação-em-moçambique/a-16948901|newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]]|access-date=March 13, 2015|title=As feridas abertas pelo processo de reeducação em Moçambique|trans-title=The wounds opened by the re-education process in Mozambique|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the changes in the social and religious situation after Mozambique, the Roman Catholic Church vented public criticism. Catholic bishops condemned a godless society and criticized the death penalty and re-education camps. In 1978 it decided to transform into a church of communities, something the state understood as a move towards [[Mozambican Civil War|resistance]] to [[Socialism]], rather than the collaboration stated by some Bishops. The result was an outright attack on all religion on the part of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Serapiao, Luis Benjamim. "The Catholic Church and conflict resolution in Mozambique's post-colonial conflict, 1977-1992." ''Journal of Church and State ''46.2 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

From early 1979, the regime attempted to discredit the church on the basis of the history of the colonial church, and it began a campaign to close churches, prevent religious activities and restrict the movements of religious staff. Catholic and other religious institutions resisted, more or less openly. By 1980, resistance was often open and bad international criticism was rife, something which convinced Frelimo to change its stance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Several Protestant groups in Mozambique had strong allegiance to the Frelimo government, potentially because many in the Frelimo leadership (including the late national hero Eduardo Mondlane) had been trained in Protestant schools and the World Council of Churches had supported the Mozambique institute in Dar es Salaam during the war of liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Serapiao, Luis Benjamim. "The Catholic Church and conflict resolution in Mozambique's post-colonial conflict, 1977-1992." ''Journal of Church and State'' 46.2 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; But many non-Catholic churches suffered much nonetheless, not least the Jehovah's Witnesses who were all deported to Zambezia and the Nazarene Church which saw many of its missionaries imprisoned.

Islam suffered probably the most during the Anti-religious campaign, because of the plain misunderstanding or prejudice of the Frelimo leadership. Ministers thought, for example, that raising pigs was a good idea to combat underdevelopment and they genuinely did not understand resistance on the part of Muslims in the north of the country. Some long-lasting trauma was thus created.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Morier-Genoud, “L’Islam au Mozambique après l’indépendance. Histoire d’une montée en puissance”, ''L’Afrique Politique 2002'', Paris: Karthala, 2002, pp. 123-146; Bonate, Liazzat J. K. , “Muslim Religious Leadership in Post-Colonial Mozambique.” South African Historical Journal, No 60 (4), 2008, 637-654.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renamo benefitted from Frelimo's anti-religious attack. Some campaigning was done nationally and internationally by the rebel movement on the subject of religion already in 1978, but with little long-lasting impact - only some radical American and English Pentecostal groups openly sided with Renamo. The guerilla stance was indeed eventually ambiguous in relation to religious institutions, and the movement did not hesitate to take religious hostages or kill missionaries, national priests, pastors or nuns.

The anti-religious campaign of Frelimo formally ended in 1982 when the party in power held a meeting with all the main religious institutions. On that occasion, it claimed mistakes had been made and national unity needed to prevail. State control of religious institutions continued after 1982, but the state attack on faith had come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;FRELIMO (1983) ''"Consolidemos aquilo que nos une": reunião da Direcção do Partido e do Estado com os representantes das confissões religiosas 14 a 17 de Dezembro de 1982'', Imprensa Nacional de Moçambique, Maputo&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section&amp;nbsp;116 of the [[Constitution of Australia]]''' precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (''i.e.'', the federal parliament) from making laws for establishing any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting the free exercise of any religion. Section&amp;nbsp;116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a compromise in the pre-[[Federation of Australia|Federation]] constitutional conventions, Section&amp;nbsp;116 is based on similar provisions in the [[United States Constitution]]. However, Section&amp;nbsp;116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]] from making such laws.

Section&amp;nbsp;116 has been interpreted narrowly by the [[High Court of Australia]]: while the definition of "religion" adopted by the court is broad and flexible, the scope of the protection of religions is circumscribed. The result of the court's approach has been that no court has ever ruled a law to be in contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;116, and the provision has played only a minor role in [[Constitutional history of Australia|Australian constitutional history]]. Among the laws that the High Court has ruled not to be in contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;116 are laws that provided government funding to religious schools, that authorised the [[Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth|dissolution of a branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses]], and that enabled the forcible removal of [[Indigenous Australian]] children from their families.

[[Federal Government of Australia|Federal Governments]] have twice proposed the amendment of Section&amp;nbsp;116, principally to apply its provisions to laws made by the states. On each occasion—in [[Australian referendum, 1944|1944]] and [[Australian referendum, 1988 (Rights and Freedoms)|1988]]—the proposal failed in a referendum.

==Text of the provision and location in the Constitution==

Section&amp;nbsp;116 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|116}} Commonwealth not to legislate in respect of religion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section&amp;nbsp;116 has four limbs.  The first three limbs prohibit the Commonwealth from making certain laws: laws "for establishing any religion"; laws "for imposing any religious observance"; and laws "for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion".  The fourth limb proscribes the imposition of religious tests to qualify for any Commonwealth office or public trust.&lt;ref name="Williams1165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackshield &amp; Williams|2010|p=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the "establishing religion" and "prohibiting free exercise" limbs have been the subject of cases before the High Court.&lt;ref name="Williams1165"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanks1207"/&gt;

The section sits in Chapter V of the Constitution, which deals with the states of Australia.  However, Section&amp;nbsp;116 does not apply to the states.&lt;ref name="Hanks1207"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each state has its own constitution, and only Tasmania's has a provision similar to Section&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|2009|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators attribute the erroneous location of Section&amp;nbsp;116 to a drafting oversight caused by the weariness of the committee charged with finalising the draft Constitution.&lt;ref name="Hanks1207"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|La Nauze|1972|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Hbhiggins.jpg|thumb|left|[[H. B. Higgins]], proponent of Section&amp;nbsp;116 in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions|alt=A black and white portrait of [[H. B. Higgins]]]]

The Constitution was the product of a series of constitutional conventions in the 1890s. The issues of religious freedom and secularism were not prominent in the convention debates, which focused on the economic and legislative powers of the proposed Commonwealth parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first draft of Section&amp;nbsp;116, approved by the Melbourne Convention of 1891, would have prohibited the states from passing laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion. The Commonwealth was not mentioned because it was assumed that the Commonwealth parliament would have no power to make such laws.&lt;ref name="QG"&gt;{{Harvnb|Quick &amp; Garran|1901|p=951}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Melbourne Convention of 1897, Victorian delegate [[H. B. Higgins]] expressed concern about this assumption and moved to expand the provision to cover the Commonwealth as well as the states.&lt;ref name="QG"/&gt; The amendment was initially defeated, but Higgins later succeeded in having the eventual version of Section&amp;nbsp;116 adopted by the convention in a 25–16 vote.&lt;ref name="QG"/&gt; Higgins feared opposition to the provision from convention delegates concerned that the provision would impede the states' legislative powers, so the version passed by the convention did not mention the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2002|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed inclusion of Section&amp;nbsp;116 in the Constitution was the subject of some dissent in the 1897 Melbourne Convention and the final convention in 1898.  Protestant churches in New South Wales argued that the Constitution should state that divine providence is the "ultimate source of law", while convention delegates [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]] and [[Patrick Glynn]] moved to have God explicitly recognised in the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] campaigned for a strict separation of church and state, being concerned that the Commonwealth might prohibit its members from working on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|pp=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides to some extent achieved their objectives: Section&amp;nbsp;116 was approved by the final convention, while Glynn successfully moved for the symbolic mention of "Almighty God" in the preamble to the British statute that was to contain the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|pp=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution was then approved by popular referendums in each of the six colonies and took effect on 1 January 1901 (the colonies thus became the states of Australia).&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Irving|1999|pp=415–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section&amp;nbsp;116 reflects two provisions of the [[United States Constitution]]: the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], which prohibits the making of laws for the establishment of religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion; and [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article&amp;nbsp;VI]], Section&amp;nbsp;3, which [[No religious test clause|prohibits the imposition of religious tests]] for public offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cumbrae-Stewart|1946|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|1951|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Clifford L. Pannam, writing in 1963, called Section&amp;nbsp;116 a "fairly blatant piece of transcription" of its US counterparts.&lt;ref name="Pannam41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pannam|1963|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, Section&amp;nbsp;116 has been interpreted more narrowly than the US provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial consideration==

The High Court's consideration of Section&amp;nbsp;116 has generally been limited to three areas: the definition of "religion"; the meaning of "law for establishing any religion"; and the meaning of "law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion".&lt;ref name="Hanks1209"/&gt;  The two other elements of the provision—the clauses prohibiting the Commonwealth from imposing of religious observance and from prescribing religious tests for public offices—have not been the subject of any cases before the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Villalta Puig &amp; Tudor|2009|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court has never ruled a legislative provision to be in contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1228}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the court's narrow and literal interpretation of Section&amp;nbsp;116, the provision has played a minor role in Australian constitutional history.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1994|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning of "religion"===

A threshold test considered by courts applying Section 116 is whether a belief seeking constitutional protection is a "religion".&lt;ref name="Hanks1209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading authority on the question is the 1983 judgment of the High Court in ''Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic)''.&lt;ref name="Church of New Faith"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=(1953) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that [[Scientology]] was a religion, despite some justices commenting that its practices were "impenetrably obscure". In reaching this finding, the court argued that the definition of religion needed to be flexible but should recognise the need to be sceptical of disingenous claims of religious practice.&lt;ref name="Hanks1209"/&gt; Justices [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Anthony Mason]] and [[Gerard Brennan]] held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the criteria of religion [are] twofold: first, belief in a supernatural, Being, Thing or Principle; and second, the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=(1953) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |courtname=auto}} per Mason and Brennan JJ at para. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justices [[Ronald Wilson]] and [[William Deane]] were less prescriptive, setting out five "indicia" of a religion: a belief in the supernatural; a belief in ideas relating to "man's nature and place in the universe"; the adherence to particular standards, codes of conduct or practices by those who hold the ideas; the existence of an identifiable group of believers, even if not a formal organisation; and the opinion of the believers that what they believe in constitutes a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1209–1210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=(1953) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |courtname=auto}} per Wilson and Deane JJ at para. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Establishing any religion"===

The courts have taken a narrow approach to the interpretation of the prohibition against "establishing any religion", deriving from the 1981 case of ''[[Attorney-General (Vic) (Ex rel Black) v Commonwealth]]'' (the ''DOGS'' case),&lt;ref name="DOGS HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|2|1981|litigants=[[Attorney-General (Vic); Ex Rel Black v Commonwealth]] ("DOGS case") |parallelcite=(1981) 146 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 559 |date=2 February 1981 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the High Court held that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not contravene Section&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|pp=143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[Garfield Barwick]] held that a law would only contravene the provision if establishing a religion was its "express and single purpose", while Justice [[Harry Gibbs]] argued that the section only prohibits the establishment of an official state religion.  Each justice in the majority contrasted Section&amp;nbsp;116 with its equivalent in the US Constitution to find that Section&amp;nbsp;116 is narrower. The court noted that the US Constitution prohibits laws respecting "establishment of religion" generally, whereas the prohibition in Section&amp;nbsp;116 is against the establishment of "''any'' religion": this meant that Section&amp;nbsp;116 did not encompass laws that benefit religions generally; it only proscribed laws that established a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of the High Court to the establishment limb of Section&amp;nbsp;116 thus largely reflects the views expressed by Constitutional scholars [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]] and [[Robert Garran]] in 1901, that establishment means "the erection and recognition of a State Church, or the concession of special favours, titles, and advantages to one church which are denied to others."&lt;ref name="QG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Prohibiting the free exercise of any religion"===

The protection of the free exercise of religion was also interpreted narrowly in early High Court judgments.&lt;ref name="Hanks12171218"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1217–1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the court in ''Krygger v Williams'',&lt;ref name="Krygger"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|65|1912|litigants=Krygger v Williams |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/65.pdf (1912) 15 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 366] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; held that a person could not object to compulsory military service on the ground of religious belief.&lt;ref name="Hanks12171218"/&gt; The court considered that Section&amp;nbsp;116 would only protect religious observance from government interference; it would not permit a person to be excused from a legal obligation merely because the obligation conflicted with his or her religious beliefs. In a 1929 case, Higgins, then a Justice of the High Court, suggested (as ''[[obiter dictum]]'') that a person could lawfully object to [[compulsory voting]] on the grounds of religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1943, the court continued the narrow approach it took in ''Krygger v Williams'', upholding war-time regulations that caused the [[Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth|Adelaide branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses]] to be dissolved and have its property acquired by the Commonwealth government. The government had declared the branch to be an organisation whose activities were "prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth": one of the branch's professed beliefs was that the government was an "organ of [[Satan]]". Chief Justice [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]] held that the Constitution permitted the court to "reconcile religious freedom with ordered government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1218–1223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1943|litigants=Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses Incorporated v Commonwealth |link=Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1943/12.pdf (1943) 67 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 116] |courtname=auto}} per Latham CJ at para. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 case known as the [[Kruger v Commonwealth|''Stolen Generations Case'']],&lt;ref name="Stolen HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1997|litigants=[[Kruger v Commonwealth]] (Stolen Generations case) |parallelcite=(1997) 190 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the court upheld an ordinance issued in 1918 that enabled the forcible removal of [[Indigenous Australian]] children from their families. The court reasoned that the purpose of the ordinance was not to prohibit the free exercise of religion even though the ordinance may have had that effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1223–1224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Edge, an academic specialising in religion and the law, thus concludes that Section&amp;nbsp;116 will only "prevent legislation that has a prohibited purpose, rather than a prohibited effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edge|2006|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her judgment, Gaudron J, while finding that the provision 'cannot be construed as impliedly conferring an independent or free-standing right which, if breached, sounds in damages at the suit of the individual whose interests are thereby affected' left open the possibility that it might nonetheless, in limiting Commonwealth legislative power, apply to a provision that has the effect, as opposed merely to the purpose, of limiting free exercise.&lt;ref name="Stolen HCA"/&gt;

==Commentary==

When the Constitution took effect in 1901, Quick and Garran argued that Section&amp;nbsp;116 was redundant as the Commonwealth had not been given the legislative power under [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|Section&amp;nbsp;51]] to establish a religion or prohibit its free exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Quick &amp; Garran|1901|p=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Pannam wrote that the provision was regarded "by all as having little practical value". Pannam considered the provision would only become significant if the High Court held that it applied to laws made by governments of the territories.&lt;ref name="Pannam41"/&gt;

Constitutional scholar [[George Williams (lawyer)|George Williams]], writing in 1994, criticised the court's literal interpretation of the provision and others in the Constitution, saying the court has "transformed the Constitution into a wasteland of civil liberties". Williams argues that as an "express guarantee of personal freedom", the provision should be interpreted broadly and promote "individual liberty over the arbitrary exercise of legislative and executive power".&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; Academics Gonzalo Villalta Puig and Steven Tudor have called for the court to broaden Section&amp;nbsp;116 by finding in it an implied right to the freedom of thought and conscience. In their view most Australians correctly "believe that the Constitution protects the right to freedom of thought and conscience just like it protects other civil and political freedoms", and that the court should give effect to that belief. They argue there is precedent for the court finding implied constitutional rights, such as the 1992 case of ''[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|45|1992|litigants=[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1992) 177 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 106 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where the court found that the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of political communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Villalta Puig &amp; Tudor|2009|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In defence of Section&amp;nbsp;116 and the High Court's interpretation of it, Joshua Puls argues that the provision is appropriately limited, suggesting that a rigid "wall of separation" between religion and the state is undesirable, and that the stronger Constitutional protection of religion in the United States has become overly politicised.&lt;ref name="Puls 1998 160" /&gt; Fellow academics Jennifer Clarke, Patrick Keyzer and James Stellios argue that the court's narrow interpretation of the provision is consistent with the intention of the Constitution's drafters, who never intended for it to be a protection of individual rights,&lt;ref name="Hanks1227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1227}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Kevin Booker and Arthur Glass say the provision has "symbolic value". Booker and Glass defend the court's interpretation of the provision and other Constitutional rights, saying "the High Court can only work with the constitutional provisions before it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Booker &amp; Glass|2009|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referendums==
{{See also |Australian referendum, 1944 |Australian referendum, 1988 (Rights and Freedoms)}}
Federal governments have twice proposed [[Referendums in Australia|referendums]] to expand the scope of Section&amp;nbsp;116: in 1944 and in 1988. In 1944, [[John Curtin]]'s [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government put a package of measures, known as the "Fourteen Powers referendum", to the Australian public. The purpose of the package was mainly to widen the Commonwealth's legislative powers for the purposes of post-war reconstruction. The widening of powers would [[sunset provision|sunset]] after five years. One of the measures in the package was to extend Section&amp;nbsp;116 so that it prohibited the states, not merely the Commonwealth, from making the laws proscribed by the section.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; The package's 14 measures—which included diverse matters such as powers to provide family allowances and legislate for "national health"—were bound together in a single question. [[H. V. Evatt]], the Labor [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], argued that [[freedom of religion]] was "fundamental to the whole idea of democracy" and that the suppression of civil rights by dictatorships in Europe demonstrated the need for Australia to have a strong Constitutional guarantee of the freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Galligan |1995 |p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative [[United Australia Party]], then in opposition and led by [[Robert Menzies]], campaigned against the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Nethercote |2001 |p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Fadden]], leader of the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], claimed a "yes" vote would permit the government to implement a "policy of socialisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6UwQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=75QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7101,5695609&amp;hl=en |title=Country Party's "No" Campaign |date=25 July 1944 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The package was rejected: the national "yes" vote was less than 46 per cent, and there was majority support for the package only in South Australia and Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/referendums/Referendum_Dates_and_Results.htm |title=Referendum Dates and Results 1906 – present |work=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the rejection was the bundling of multiple controversial proposals into one question: voters could not vote in favour of the measures they supported and against those they opposed, giving them reason to vote against the entire package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Scott |title=Constitutional Referenda in Australia |publisher=Department of the Parliamentary Library, Parliament of Australia |location=Canberra |year=1999 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1999-2000/2000rp02.htm#ACCOUNT |accessdate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207163730/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1999-2000/2000rp02.htm#ACCOUNT |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar proposal to amend Section&amp;nbsp;116 was put to the Australian people in a referendum in 1988. The referendum contained four questions, the last of which sought to amend Section&amp;nbsp;116 and other constitutional "rights and freedoms". Again, the proposal was initiated by a Labor government (under [[Bob Hawke]]); again, the proposal was opposed by the conservative parties;&lt;ref name="Frozen Continent"/&gt; and again, multiple controversial proposals were bound into one question, being "to alter the Constitution to extend the right to trial by jury, to extend freedom of religion, and to ensure fair terms for persons whose property is acquired by any government." The proposal in respect of Section&amp;nbsp;116 was to extend its operation to the states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=tq9EAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fZYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5910,5678604&amp;dq=referendum+religion+states+constitution+australia&amp;hl=en |title=Political maturity put to the test |last=Hamer |first=Rupert |date=9 August 1988 |work=[[The Age]] |p=13 |accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expand the protection to cover any government act (not just legislation) that established a religion or prohibited its free exercise.&lt;ref name="Puls 1998 160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some church officials objected to the proposal, fearing that funding of religious schools by the states could become unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=U1kpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gZYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3303,3701810&amp;dq=referendum+religion+australia&amp;hl=en |title=Bishops to deal blow on referendum |last=Grattan |first=Michelle |author2=Doogue, Edmund  |date=15 August 1988 |work=The Age |accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bowen assurance to schools on 'yes' vote |last=Seccombe |first=Mike |date=16 August 1988 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question failed to pass, being opposed by a majority of voters in each of the states.&lt;ref name="Frozen Continent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional change : select sources on constitutional change in Australia 1901–1997 |publisher=House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs |location=Canberra, Australia |year=1997 |pages=113–114 |isbn=0-644-48410-1 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/House/committee/laca/ConstitutionalChange/part2.pdf |accessdate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050719100831/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/laca/ConstitutionalChange/part2.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 70 to 30 per cent nationwide vote against the proposal was the largest margin by which a proposal to amend the Constitution had ever been defeated at a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Williams |2002 |p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams attributes the failure of the proposal mainly to the absence of bipartisan support for it, highlighting the "determined and effective" opposition of senior [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] politician [[Peter Reith]].&lt;ref name="Frozen Continent"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/frozen-continent/2008/03/28/1206207408050.html?page=2 |title=Frozen continent |last=Williams |first=George |date=29 March 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also points to the "notorious reluctance" of Australians to support Constitutional referendums: of the 44 proposals to amend the Constitution, only eight have succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Williams |1994 |p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Totenpass''''' (plural ''Totenpässe'') is a [[German language|German]] term sometimes used for [[epigraphy|inscribed]] tablets or metal leaves found in burials primarily of those presumed to be initiates into [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]], [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]], and some ancient [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] and [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic religions]]. The term may be understood in English as a "[[passport]] for the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Roy Kotansky, "Incantations and Prayers for Salvation on Inscribed Greek Amulets", in ''Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion,'' edited by Christopher A. Faraone and [[Dirk Obbink]] (Oxford University Press, 1991), p.{{nbsp}}116.&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called Orphic gold tablets are perhaps the best-known example.

''Totenpässe'' are placed on or near the body as a phylactery, or rolled and inserted into a capsule often worn around the neck as an [[amulet]]. The [[epigraphy|inscription]] instructs the initiate on how to navigate the [[afterlife]], including directions for avoiding hazards in the landscape of the dead and formulaic responses to the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] judges.

==Examples==
[[J. Paul Getty Museum|The Getty Museum]] owns an outstanding example of a 4th-century BC Orphic prayer sheet from [[Thessaly]], a gold-leaf rectangle measuring about {{convert|26|by|38|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;As of September 17, 2008, [[J. Paul Getty Museum|The Getty Villa Malibu]] had this Orphic ''lamella'' on exhibition; information about the piece [http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=8289 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The burial site of a woman also in Thessaly and dating to the late 4th{{nbsp}}century BC yielded a pair of ''Totenpässe'' in the form of ''lamellae'' ([[Latin]], "thin metal sheets", singular ''lamella''). Although the term "[[metal leaf|leaf]]" to describe metal foil is a modern metaphorical usage,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ogden, ''Greek and Roman Necromancy'' (Princeton University Press, 2001), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; these ''lamellae'' were in this case cut in the shape of [[leaf shape|cordate leaves]] probably meant to represent [[ivy]]; most ''Totenpässe'' of this type are rectangular. The [[Greek alphabet|Greek lettering]] is not inscribed in regular lines as it is on the rectangular tablets, but rambles to fit the shape. The leaves are paper-thin and small, one measuring {{convert|40|by|31|mm|in|abbr=on}} and the other {{convert|35|by|30|mm|in|abbr=on}}. They had been arranged symmetrically on the woman's chest, with her lips sealed by a gold ''[[danake]]'', or "[[Charon's obol]]", the coin that pays the ferryman of the dead for passage; this particular coin depicted the head of a [[Gorgon]]. Also placed in the tomb was a [[Greek terracotta figurines|terracotta figurine]] of a [[maenad]], one of the ecstatic women in the retinue of [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Tasntsanoglou and George M. Parássoglou, "Two Gold Lamellae from Thessaly", ''Hellenica'' 38 (1987), pp.{{nbsp}}3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the meandering and fragile text poses difficulties, the inscriptions appear to speak of the unity of life and death and of [[reincarnation|rebirth]], possibly in divine form. The deceased is supposed to stand before [[Persephone]], Queen of the Dead, and assert "I have been released by [[cult of Dionysus|Bacchios]] himself."&lt;ref&gt;K. Tasntsanoglou and George M. Parássoglou, "Two Gold Lamellae from Thessaly", ''Hellenica'' 38 (1987) 3–16, with photographic plates and line drawings.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[Günther Zuntz]] made the most complete survey of gold tablets discovered up to 1971 (at [[Thurii]], [[Crete]], and elsewhere), categorizing them into three groups that have become the [[Typology (archaeology)|typological]] standard. Zuntz presented [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] text coupled with a reconstruction, and interpreted their religious foundation as [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] rather than [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]].&lt;ref&gt;Günther Zuntz, "The Gold Leaves", in ''Persephone: Three Essays on Religion and Thought in Magna Graecia'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971); review by [[Joseph Fontenrose]], ''Classical Philology'' 69 (1974) 60–63.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philology|Philologist]] [[Richard Janko]] proposed that Group{{nbsp}}B from Zuntz's collection derived from a single archetype, for which he offered a hypothetical [[ancient Greek|Greek]] text and the following English translation while attempting, he emphasized, not to rely on preconceptions about underlying [[theology]]:&lt;ref&gt;On the problematic relation between [[grave goods]] and [[eschatology]], see Ian Morris, ''Death-ritual and Social Structure in Classical Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oMGiB3RV__EC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Orphic%3B+Pythagoreans+or+Dionysiacs%22+intitle:Death-ritual+intitle:and+intitle:Social+intitle:Structure+intitle:in+intitle:Classical+intitle:Antiquity&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U2YVbbkEbNvEcgJILFifGbvpl-rCg pp. 17–18.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely available source that discusses the Orphic gold tablets is the classic (if superseded in some aspects) ''Orpheus and Greek Religion'' by [[W. K. C. Guthrie]].&lt;ref&gt;[[W.K.C. Guthrie]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-C6wNyrxUO8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:orpheus+intitle:and+intitle:Greek+intitle:Religion+inauthor:guthrie&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U2RFT3DjQZr0_A0indp_cF4oA-vyg Orpheus and Greek Religion]: A Study of the Orphic Movement'' (New York: Norton, 1966, revised edition), pp. 171–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, the usefulness of the term "Orphic" has been questioned by scholars, as has the unity of religious belief underlying the gold tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe G. Edmonds, III, ''Myths of the Underworld Journey: Plato, Aristophanes, and the 'Orphic' Gold Tablets'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), limited preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=I_YkMvUVoyYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Myths+intitle:of+intitle:the+intitle:Underworld+intitle:Journey&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U0VxDa-owmk3oSyuaaBc1muKGs9og here.]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the association of the tablets with Orphism has been defended.&lt;ref&gt;Bernabé, Alberto, and Ana Isabel Jiménez San Cristóbal. ''Instructions for the Netherworld: The Orphic Gold Tablets''. Boston: Brill, 2008: pp.{{nbsp}}204—205.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Totenpässe'' have also been found in tombs from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] dating from the 2nd{{nbsp}}century BC and later. These tiny gold sheets employ a formulaic consolation that appears regularly on funerary [[stele]]s in the area: {{lang|grc|θάρσει}}, (here the name of the deceased is inserted), {{lang|grc|οὐδεὶς ἀθάνατος}} ("Take courage, [name], no one is immortal). In one instance, the inscribed tablet was shaped like a funerary headband, with holes to bind it around the forehead.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Kotansky, "Incantations and Prayers for Salvation on Inscribed Greek Amulets: The Magic ''Lamellae''," in ''Magika Hiera'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), p.{{nbsp}}116; David R.

'''Vegetalismo''' is a term used to refer to a practice of ''[[mestizo]]'' [[shamanic|shamanism]] in the [[Peruvian Amazon]] in which the [[Shamanism|shamans]] — known as ''vegetalistas'' — are said to gain their knowledge and power to cure from the ''vegetales'', or plants of the region. Many believe to receive their knowledge from ingesting the [[hallucinogenic]], [[emetic]] brew [[ayahuasca]].&lt;ref name="luna"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/26541421/Vegetalismo-Shamanism-Among-the-Mestizo-Population-of-the-Peruvian-Amazon Luis Eduardo Luna, '&amp;#39;Vegetalismo shamanism among the Mestizo population of the Peruvian Amazon'&amp;#39;]. Scribd.com (1986-06-05). Retrieved on 2012-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curelist"&gt;''[http://thecurelist.com/vegetalismo/ Vegetalismo]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term ''vegetalismo'' is used to distinguish ''vegetalistas'' from other such healers as ''[[oracionista]]s'' ([[prayer]] healers) and [[espiritismo|espiritistas]] (spiritist healers).&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; The term is used by followers of [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] [[new religious movement]]s to refer to both indigenous and mestizo [[ayahuasca]] shamanism in contrast to their practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beyer|first=Stephan|title=Singing to the Plants: A Guide to Mestizo Shamanism in the Upper Amazon|year=2009|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-4730-5|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, among mestizos in the [[Peruvian Amazon]], the term ''vegetalismo'' is used to distinguish ''[[mestizo]]'' [[shamanism]] from the traditional shamanism practiced by indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Beyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beyer|first=Stephan|title=Singing to the Plants: A Guide to Mestizo Shamanism in the Upper Amazon|year=2009|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-4730-5|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related religious movements include the more formal [[União do Vegetal]] and [[Santo Daime]].

==Structure of vegetalismo==
The ''vegetalismo'' practice combines deep [[Catholic]] elements with the [[animism|animistic]] religious beliefs common to [[indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous]] tribes throughout the region. Though many [[vegetalista]]s declare themselves to be Catholics, they receive their knowledge and power to heal from their special relationship with the [[spirit]]s of the [[Amazon rainforest]].&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; ''Vegetalistas'' maintain relationships with two types of spirits: the spirits of the healing plants, often appearing in human form, and protective spirits, often appearing as powerful animals, birds, or humans.&lt;ref name="Beyer-nopage"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beyer|first=Stephan|title=Singing to the Plants: A Guide to Mestizo Shamanism in the Upper Amazon|year=2009|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-4730-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other spirit-beings (non-human entities) that exist in the [[visionary]] world that can assist the [[shaman]]; beings that come from other [[planet]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], beings that come from [[Infinity|infinite]] [[labyrinth]]s of [[crystal]] rooms, and beings who live in the deep [[rainforest]] and beneath the dark waters.&lt;ref name="Beyer-nopage"/&gt; In contrast to [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[shamanism]] in the [[upper Amazon]], which is based within a [[rural]] environment and whose focus is to maintain or restore social balance, [[mestizo]] [[shamanism]] is based within an [[urban area|urban]] environment and is focused on individual [[healing]]. Many of these mestizo shamans have ''consultarios'' ([[clinics]]), where they provide consultations and healing ceremonies for patients, as well as other services such as massages and general, simple healing sessions, which usually involve the shaman sucking out the sickness from the patient's body, protecting the body with [[shacapa]] and [[tobacco]] [[smoke]], and then prescribing an herbal remedy to help the patient in their recovery from the sickness.&lt;ref name="Beyer-nopage" /&gt;

==Initiation==
Although ''vegetalismo'' is strongly influenced by indigenous Amazonian cosmology, and to become a ''vegetalista'' one must abide by prescriptions that conform closely to those found among Indian tribes of the upper [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], ''vegetalistas'' do not associate themselves with any specific tribe, therefore there is no community to support the initiation and recognize that the individual has become a ''vegetalista''.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; One becomes a ''vegetalista'' out of personal choice or vocation, and their shamanic powers become recognized gradually as they build up their reputation in the community in which they live.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyer-nopage"/&gt;

;La Dieta
In order to ''dominar'', or ''master'' the plants, one must first prove to the plants that he or she is worthy of their trust.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; They must show the spirits that they are strong and faithful individuals, and in order to do this they must spend generally a minimum of six months in isolation, living deep in the ''monte'' (the [[wilderness]]) in order to take on the odor of the jungle and take in the gifts of the spirits, while following ''la dieta'', the restricted [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] in order to become a very powerful shaman.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; La dieta is key to forming a relationship with the plants, for the plants will not reveal themselves, their uses, and their [[icaro]]s (sacred songs) to those not following the restricted diet.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; While a [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]] is undertaking ''la dieta'', he or she must abstain from [[sugar]], [[salt]], and [[sex]], and often [[oil]] and [[fat]] as well. Generally, human beings smell bad to the spirits, so one must go on this long diet in order to purify oneself from this bad odor. One must practice abstinence while on la dieta in order to eliminate the smell of human sex, for to the spirits this smell is vile and repulsive.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; However, one must do more than the restricted diet in order to learn the plants, one must also ingest the plant, stay loyal to the plant while taking it into his or her body and allowing it to teach from within.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; Once the neophyte has undergone la dieta and has won the love of the plants, the spirits of the plants will appear to the neophyte either in visions or dreams. It is then that the plants begin to teach the neophyte their magical healing and protective songs, or ''[[icaro]]s''.

==Gifts of the Spirits==
;Icaros
An [[icaro]] is the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] [[chant]] or [[melody]] that the [[novice]] receives from the plant spirits after he or she has been purified by the restricted diet.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; The word "icaro" may come from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] verb ''ikaray'', blow smoke for healing, or it may come from the [[Shipibo]] term ''ikarra'', [[shaman]] song.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; For indigenous tribes throughout the Amazon, songs are a key component in a healing ritual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langdon|first=Jean Matteson|title=Portals of Power: Shamanism in South America|year=1992|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;La Flema
Once a neophyte's [[initiation]] is near completion, either the spirits or a senior shaman will give him or her a magic [[phlegm]], a magical saliva-like substance which is also called ''[[yachay]]'', ''llausa'', or ''la flema''.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; This substance is known to be the materialization of the shaman's ''fuerza'', or power, and it stored within the shaman's body, usually in the chest or stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In darkness and secrecy: the anthropology of assault sorcery and witchcraft in Amazonia|editor=Neil L. Whitehead|editor2= Robin Wright|author=Strathern &amp; Stewart|chapter=Afterword: Substances, Powers, Cosmos, and History|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=9780822333456|pages=314–320}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phlegm grows as a result of smoking ''mapacho'' and drinking [[ayahuasca]].&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; Both healers and sorcerers store ''virotes'' (magic darts) in ''la flema'', and within the sorcerer's phlegm one may also find creatures such as toads, scorpions, snakes and insects.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; A rarefied form of this phlegm, known as ''mariri'', is what makes it possible for the shaman to extract harmful magical darts or a sickness from the patient's body while protecting the shaman from the sorcery and sickness that he/she sucks out.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; The ''mariri'' is said to be air-like and its power often comes out in the act of ''blowing'', which can both cure and kill depending on its use.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt;

;''Virotes''
The term ''virote'', originally the Spanish name for a very strong arrow, is a term used in ''vegetalismo'' to refer to the magical darts that the shamans and sorcerers store in their phlegm.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; Poet César Calvo describes a ''virote'' as a "very small poisoned dart, capable of abandoning and resuming its material shape in order to transverse any distance; any time; any wall, shield, or protection; to nail itself in enemy flesh and to reach the target selected by the sorcerer who gave it form and then animated that form, endowing it with destiny and transcendence."&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; Depending on the culture and various circumstances, these [[pathogenic]] [[projectile]]s can be materialized as a number of different things, including the thorns of spiny palm trees, insects, tiny stones, stingray stings, snake fangs, scorpions, toads, monkey hair, among other menacing things.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luna &amp; Amaringo|title=Ayahuasca Visions: The Religious Iconography of a Peruvian Shaman|year=1993|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkely|isbn=978-1556430640}}[http://ayahuasca.taystes-os.net]&lt;/ref&gt; In the practice of shamanism among indigenous groups like the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], these ''virotes'' are often referred to as ''[[tsentsak]]''.

;Magic Stones
Magic stones, ''piedras encantadas'', are an important tool in the practice of ''vegetalismo''. The appearance of the stone varies, some have a striking appearance which indicates that they are ''encantada'', for example the stone may be shaped like a person or animal, have an unusual color, or just be rare.&lt;ref name="luna &amp; Amaringo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Luna &amp; Amaringo|title=Ayahuasca Visions: The Religious Iconography of a Peruvian Shaman|year=1993|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkely|isbn=978-1556430640|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crystal]]s are particularly prized as ''piedras encantadas'', as they are thought to be of a [[Astronomical object|celestial]] origin.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; These magical stones are used to help those patients who appear to be victims of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], the [[shaman]] will place the stone on the body where the [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] has struck and the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] stone will stick there for several hours, sucking out the dart, [[phlegm]], [[scorpion]], or whatever harm has been inflicted there by the [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]].&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; In order to master the use of these enchanted stones, the shaman must drink them while following ''la dieta'', just as he does the plants. Before the shaman drinks the water, the stone is left in water for a day, and the shaman blows tobacco smoke over it while telling the stone what it is he wants to know.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; It is only after this that the spirit of the stone will appear to the shaman in a dream.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt;

==Ayahuasca==
{{Main|Ayahuasca}}
The ayahuasca ceremony is a widespread practice among ''vegetalistas'', one that has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to the success of the industry of ''ayahuasca tourism'', in which people from all over the world travel to places such as [[Peru]] to partake in an [[ayahuasca]] session led by a ''vegetalismo'' shaman.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt; These sessions vary greatly depending on the vegetalista conducting the ceremony, and there are significant differences between an ayahuasca session held in an urban setting and one held in a rural setting.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; In urban settings a shaman will usually hold one of these sessions several times a week, and they usually draw crowds of about twenty people or more, many of whom don't know each other.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; In rural settings the groups are much smaller, usually less than ten people, and the people involved often know each other or have kindred ties.&lt;ref name="luna"/&gt; Generally in the urban setting the shaman will meet and speak briefly to everyone in attendance for the ceremony, gathering information on their illnesses and what it is their seeking to find from ingesting ''ayahuasca''. Some people attend these ceremonies regularly as a [[purge]], to cleanse themselves.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt;

==Purpose==

Initially a Bahá'í observance, World Religion Day was inspired by the Bahá'í principles of the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|oneness of religion]] and of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]], which describe religion as evolving continuously throughout the history of humanity.&lt;ref name="oneworld"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Progressive revelation |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interfaith"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rameshfar|first1=Saphira|title=January 17, 2016 – World Religion Day: Celebrating Our Unity|url=http://www.theinterfaithobserver.org/journal-articles/2016/1/9/january-17-2016-world-religion-day-celebrating-our-unity.html|website=The Interfaith Observer|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes these principles by highlighting the ideas that the spiritual principles underlying the world's religions are harmonious, and that religions play a significant role in unifying humanity.&lt;ref name="buck2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rotw" /&gt;

As a means of clarifying the nature and purpose of World Religion Day, the [[Universal House of Justice]], the elected council that serves as the head of the Bahá'í Faith noted in a 1968 message that, rather than providing a "platform for all religions and their emergent [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] ideas," the observance serves as "a celebration of the need for and the coming of a world religion for mankind, the [[Bahá'í Faith]] itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= The Universal House of Justice |first=  |editor1-last= Hornby |editor1-first= Helen |date= 1988  |title= Lights of Guidance (second part): A Bahá'í Reference File |url= http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2.html | chapter= 1710. World Religion Day, Purpose of |chapter-url= http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2.html&amp;chapter=4#n1710 |location= Wilmette, Illinois |publisher=  Bahá'í Publishing Trust |page= |isbn= 978-8185091464 |author-link= Universal House of Justice }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, the Universal House of Justice published a letter, "To the World’s Religious Leaders", in which it stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...interfaith discourse, if it is to contribute meaningfully to healing the ills that afflict a desperate humanity, must now address honestly ... the implications of the over-arching truth ... that God is one and that, beyond all diversity of cultural expression and human interpretation, religion is likewise one.&lt;ref name="Buck 2011 937"&gt;{{Harvnb|Buck|2011|pp=937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

World Religion Day has been described as a "[[Bahá'í]]-inspired idea that has taken on a life of its own",&lt;ref name="rotw" /&gt; because its observance is no longer confined to the Bahá'í community, where it originally took shape. Although observances of World Religion Day are still sponsored and supported by Bahá'í communities worldwide, Baha'i institutions such as the Universal House of Justice or the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States no longer play active roles in the promotion of events, apart from reporting on them. Instead, an increasing number of observances are independently organized by interfaith or multi-faith coalitions.&lt;ref name="buck2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rotw" /&gt;

==History==
The earliest observation entitled "World Peace Through World Religion" was in [[Portland, Maine]] at the [[Eastland Park Hotel]] in October 1947 with a talk by [[Firuz Kazemzadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
