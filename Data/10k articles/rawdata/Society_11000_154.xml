[[File:Gashydrat mit Struktur.jpg|320px|thumbnail|[[Clathrate hydrate]]s have been identified as a possible agent for abrupt changes.]]
An '''abrupt climate change''' occurs when the climate system is forced to transition to a new [[climate state]] at a rate that is determined by the climate system [[Earth's radiation balance|energy-balance]], and which is more rapid than the rate of change of the external forcing.&lt;ref name=def2/&gt; Past events include the end of the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]],&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S. |author2=Benton, M.J. |author3=Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12|bibcode = 2010Geo....38.1079S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Younger Dryas]],&lt;ref name="Broecker"&gt;{{Cite journal| author-link=Wallace Smith Broecker| last1=Broecker| first1=W.

Timescales of events described as 'abrupt' may vary dramatically.  Changes recorded in the climate of Greenland at the end of the Younger Dryas, as measured by ice-cores, imply a sudden warming of +{{convert|10|C-change||disp=x| (+|)}} within a timescale of a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grachev |first1=A.M. |last2=Severinghaus |first2=J.P. |title=A revised +10±4 °C magnitude of the abrupt change in Greenland temperature at the Younger Dryas termination using published GISP2 gas isotope data and air thermal diffusion constants |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |volume=24 |issue=5–6 |pages=513–9 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2004.10.016|bibcode = 2005QSRv...24..513G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other abrupt changes are the +{{convert|4|C-change||disp=x| (+|)}} on Greenland 11,270 years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kobashi |first1=T. |last2=Severinghaus |first2=J.P. |last3=Barnola |first3=J. |title=4 ± 1.5 °C abrupt warming 11,270 yr ago identified from trapped air in Greenland ice |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=268 |issue=3–4 |pages=397–407 |date=30 April 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2008.01.032 |bibcode=2008E&amp;PSL.268..397K}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the abrupt +{{convert|6|C-change}} warming 22,000 years ago on [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=K.C. |title=Abrupt climate change around 22 ka on the Siple Coast of Antarctica |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |volume=23 |issue=1–2 |pages=7–15 |date=January 2004 |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2003.09.004 |last2=White |first2=J |last3=Severinghaus |first3=J |last4=Brook |first4=E |last5=Mayewski |first5=P |last6=Alley |first6=R |last7=Steig |first7=E |last8=Spencer |first8=M |last9=Meyerson |first9=E |last10=Meese |first10=D |last11=Lamorey |first11=G |last12=Grachev |first12=A |last13=Gow |first13=A |last14=Barnett |first14=B |bibcode = 2004QSRv...23....7T }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum may have initiated anywhere between a few decades and several thousand years. Finally, Earth Systems models project that under ongoing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions as early as 2047, the Earth's near surface temperature could depart from the range of variability in the last 150 years, affecting over 3 billion people and most places of great species diversity on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mora |first1=C |title=The projected timing of climate departure from recent variability |journal=Nature |volume=502 |pages=183–187 |year=2013 |doi=10.1038/nature12540|bibcode = 2013Natur.502..183M |pmid=24108050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are essentially two definitions of abrupt climate change:

*In terms of physics, it is a ''transition of the climate system into a different mode on a time scale that is faster than the responsible forcing''.
*In terms of impacts, ''"an abrupt change is one that takes place so rapidly and unexpectedly that human or natural systems have difficulty adapting to it"''.

These definitions are complementary: the former gives some insight into how abrupt climate change comes about ; the latter explains why there is so much research devoted to it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== General ==
Possible [[tipping point (climatology)|tipping elements in the climate system]] include: [[regional effects of global warming]], some of which had abrupt onset and may therefore be regarded as abrupt climate change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lenton|first1=T.

It has been postulated that teleconnections, oceanic and atmospheric processes, on different timescales, connect both hemispheres during abrupt climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v10/n1/full/ngeo2848.html|title=Global atmospheric teleconnections during Dansgaard–Oeschger events|author=Markle et al.|publisher=Nature|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report#Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that are abrupt or irreversible|IPCC states]] that global warming "could lead to some effects that are abrupt or irreversible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter=Summary for Policymakers | title=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf | date=17 November 2007| publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', [[Richard Alley]] et al. said "it is conceivable that human forcing of climate change is increasing the probability of large, abrupt events. Were such an event to recur, the economic and ecological impacts could be large and potentially serious."&lt;ref name="Alley2002"/&gt;

A 2013 report from the U.S. [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] called for attention to the abrupt impacts of climate change, stating that even steady, gradual change in the physical climate system can have abrupt impacts elsewhere—in human infrastructure and ecosystems for example—if critical thresholds are crossed. The report emphasizes the need for an early warning system that could help society better anticipate sudden changes and emerging impacts.&lt;ref&gt;http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Report/18373&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor.&lt;ref&gt;

Climate models are unable yet to predict abrupt climate change events, or most of the past abrupt climate shifts.&lt;ref name="Mayewski2016"&gt;{{cite web|bibcode=2016EGUGA..18.2567M|title=Abrupt climate change: Past, present and the search for precursors as an aid to predicting events in the future (Hans Oeschger Medal Lecture)|year=2016|author=Mayewski, Paul Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential abrupt feedback due to [[thermokarst]] lake formations in the Arctic, in response to thawing permafrost soils, releasing additional greenhouse gas methane, is currently not accounted for in climate models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/unexpected-future-boost-of-methane-possible-from-arctic-permafrost|title=Unexpected Future Boost of Methane Possible from Arctic Permafrost|year=2018|work=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible precursor==
Most abrupt climate shifts, are likely due to sudden circulation shifts, analogous to a flood cutting a new river channel. The best-known examples are the several dozen shutdowns of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]'s [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|Meridional Overturning Circulation]] during the last [[ice age]], affecting climate worldwide.&lt;ref name="Alley2002"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Abrupt Climate Change | url = http://www.unice.fr/coquillard/UE36/Science-2003-Alley-2005-10.pdf | first11 = J.

===Weather===
Hansen et al. 2015 found, that the shutdown or substantial slowdown of the [[Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation]] (AMOC), besides possibly contributing to extreme end-[[Eemian]] events, will cause a more general increase of severe weather. Additional surface cooling from ice melt increases surface and lower tropospheric temperature gradients, and causes in model simulations a large increase of mid-latitude [[Eddy current|eddy energy]] throughout the midlatitude troposphere. This in turn leads to an increase of [[baroclinicity]] produced by stronger temperature gradients, which provides energy for more severe weather events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/acp-2015-432/|title=Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 °C global warming is highly dangerous|year=2015|authors=J.

Such a percentage increase of wind speed in a storm translates into an increase of storm power dissipation by a factor ∼1.4–2, because wind power dissipation is proportional to the cube of wind speed. However, our simulated changes refer to seasonal mean winds averaged over large grid-boxes, not individual storms.* * * Many of the most memorable and devastating storms in eastern North America and western Europe, popularly known as superstorms, have been winter cyclonic storms, though sometimes occurring in late fall or early spring, that generate near-hurricane-force winds and often large amounts of snowfall. Continued warming of low latitude oceans in coming decades will provide more water vapor to strengthen such storms. If this tropical warming is combined with a cooler North Atlantic Ocean from AMOC slowdown and an increase in midlatitude eddy energy, we can anticipate more severe baroclinic storms.

=== Consequential effects ===
Abrupt climate change has likely been the cause of wide ranging and severe effects:
*[[Mass extinctions]] in the past, most notably the Permian-Triassic Extinction event (often referred to as the [[great dying]]) and the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]], have been suggested as a consequence of abrupt climate change.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1=T.

== Climate feedback effects ==
[[File:NORTH POLE Ice (19626661335).jpg|thumb|320px|The dark ocean surface reflects only 6 percent of incoming solar radiation, instead sea ice reflects 50 to 70 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/processes/albedo.html|title=Thermodynamics: Albedo|work=NSIDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{See also|Climate change feedback|Runaway climate change}}
One source of abrupt climate change effects is a [[feedback]] process, in which a warming event causes a change which leads to further warming.  This can also apply to cooling.  Example of such feedback processes are:

*[[Ice-albedo feedback]], where the advance or retreat of ice cover alters the [[albedo|'whiteness']] of the earth, and its ability to absorb the sun's energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Comiso |first1=J. C. |url=http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/staff/personal/JonathanBamber/teaching/Env%20change%20II/comiso_grl.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727232624/http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/staff/personal/JonathanBamber/teaching/Env%20change%20II/comiso_grl.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-27 |title=A rapidly declining perennial sea ice cover in the Arctic |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=29 |issue=20 |pages=17-1–17-4 |year=2002 |doi=10.1029/2002GL015650 |bibcode=2002GeoRL..29.1956C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Soil carbon feedback]] concerns releases of carbon from soils, in response to global warming.
* The dying and burning of forests, as a result of [[global warming]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Special Feature: Exploring the likelihood and mechanism of a climate-change-induced dieback of the Amazon rainforest| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/02/12/0804619106.full.pdf| journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]| volume = 106| issue = 49| pages = 20610–20615| date=Feb 2009 | issn=0027-8424| pmid = 19218454| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0804619106| pmc =  2791614|bibcode = 2009PNAS..10620610M| last1 = Malhi | first1 = Y.| last2 = Aragao | first2 = L.

===Volcanism===
[[Isostatic rebound]] in response to glacier retreat (unloading), increased local salinity, have been attributed to increased volcanic activity at the onset of the abrupt [[Bølling-Allerød warming]], are associated with the interval of intense volcanic activity, hinting at a interaction between climate and volcanism - enhanced short-term melting of glaciers, possibly via albedo changes from particle fallout on glacier surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306418361_Interaction_between_climate_volcanism_and_isostatic_rebound_in_Southeast_Alaska_during_the_last_deglaciation|title=Interaction between climate, volcanism, and isostatic rebound in Southeast Alaska during the last deglaciation|author=Praetorius et al|year=2016|publisher=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2016.07.033|bibcode=2016E&amp;PSL.452...79P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Past events ==
[[Image:Dryas drummondii6.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Younger Dryas]] period of abrupt climate change is named after the [[Alpine plant|Alpine]] flower, [[Dryas (plant)|Dryas]].]]

Several periods of abrupt climate change have been identified in the [[paleoclimatology|paleoclimatic]] record.  Notable examples include:

* About 25 climate shifts, called [[Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles]], which have been identified in the [[ice core]] record during the glacial period over the past 100,000 years.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* The [[Younger Dryas]] event, notably its sudden end. It is the most recent of the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles and began 12,900 years ago and moved back into a warm-and-wet climate regime about 11,600 years ago.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}  It has been suggested that: "The extreme rapidity of these changes in a variable that directly represents regional climate implies that the events at the end of the last glaciation may have been responses to some kind of threshold or trigger in the North Atlantic climate system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last8=Ram |last2=Meese |first1=R.

The Afridis are most dominant in Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], inhabiting about &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;100p mi² (3000&amp;nbsp;km²)&lt;/span&gt; of rough hilly area in the eastern [[Spin Ghar]] range west of [[Peshawar]], covering most of [[Khyber Agency]], [[Frontier Region Peshawar|FR Peshawar]] and [[Frontier Region Kohat|FR Kohat]].&lt;ref name="AfridiPakDemo"&gt;[http://www.understandingfata.org/about-u-fata.php Afridi demographics in FATA and FR Kohat]&lt;/ref&gt; Their territory includes the [[Khyber Pass]] and [[Maidan (Tirah)|Maidan]] in [[Tirah]]. Afridi migrants are also found in [[India]], mostly in the states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="Indian Pathans"&gt;[http://www.khyber.org/articles/2007/Study_of_the_Pathan_Communitie.shtml Study of the Pathan Communities in Four States of India], ''Khyber.org'' (retrieved 30 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afridis are historically known for the strategic location they inhabit and their  belligerence against outside forces; battling the [[Mughal dynasty]]'s [[Mughal army|armies]] throughout Mughal rule.&lt;ref name="India" /&gt; The later clashes against [[British Empire|British expeditions]] comprised the most savage fighting of the [[Anglo-Afghan Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Thomas, ''Beyond Khyber Pass'', London, n.d. (ca. 1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[creation of Pakistan]], Afridi tribesmen also helped attack Jammu and Kashmir for Pakistan during the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1947]].&lt;ref&gt;M.K. Teng (2001) [http://www.kashmir-information.com/MKTeng/Bitter_Truth.html ''Kashmir: The Bitter Truth''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826080235/http://www.kashmir-information.com/MKTeng/Bitter_Truth.html |date=26 August 2011 }} Kashmir Information Network&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Afridis make use of their dominant social position in FATA and areas of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] by controlling transport and various businesses, including trade in arms, munitions, and other goods.&lt;ref name="India" /&gt;

The Afridi are Pashtuns, part of the Karlani tribal confederacy, who fought both against and with the British in Afghanistan during all three Anglo-Afghan wars. The British frequently classified the peoples that they conquered with fixed personality or “racial” traits and regarded the Pashtun Afridi tribesmen as “warlike” peoples and one of the [[Martial Race]]. Different Afridi clans cooperated with the British forces in exchange for subsidies, and some even served with the Khyber Rifles, an auxiliary force of the British Indian Army.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

Afridis speak the [[Afridi Pashto]].

==Etymology and origins==
The Afridis, classically called the Abaörteans ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|b|ə|.|ɔr|ˈ|t|iː|ə|n|z}}; {{lang-lat|Abaortae}}), have their original homeland as Tirah, in Khyber Agency.

According to Pashtun folklore, the Afridi tribe traces its origin back to the eponymous ancestor of all Pashtuns, [[Qais Abdur Rashid]], through his youngest son, [[Karlan]]. Thus, the Afridi tribe are one of the Karlani tribe.

===A tribe of ancient Pashtuns===
[[Herodotus]] mentions a tribe of the [[Pakthas|Pactyans]] as Aparytai (Ἀπαρύται).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh3090.htm |title= The History of Herodotus Chapter 3, Verse 91; Written 440 B.C.E, Translated by G. C. Macaulay|publisher= sacred-texts.com|accessdate= 2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars [[George Abraham Grierson|Grierson]], [[Aurel Stein|Stein]] and [[Olaf Caroe]] equate these with modern Afridis on the basis of linguistic and geographic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;

==Clans==
The Afridi Tribe is sub classified into eight sub tribes listed below.

&lt;!-- don't add or remove tribes without providing a source! --&gt;
*Kuki Khel
*Malik din Khel
*Qambar Khel
*Kamar Khel
*Zakha Khel
*Aka Khel
*Sepah
*Adam Khel
 

All Afridi clans have their own areas in the Tirah Valley, and most of them extend down into the [[Khyber Pass]] over which they have always exercised the right of toll. The Malikdin Khel live in the centre of the Tirah and hold Bagh, the traditional meeting place of Afridi ''[[jirga]]s'' or assemblies. The Aka Khel are scattered in the hills south of [[Jamrud]]. All of this area is included in the Khyber Agency. The Adam Khel live in the hills between [[Peshawar]] and [[Kohat]]. The Burki live in Kanigoram Valley, Waziristan and Peshawar. Their preserve is the [[Kohat Pass]] in which several of the most important Afridi gun factories are located.

==Religion==
All modern Afridis follow [[Islam]]. Their conversion to Islam is attributed to Sultan (Emperor) [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] by Ibbetson&lt;ref&gt;Denzil Ibbetson, Edward MacLagan, H. A. Rose "A Glossary of The Tribes &amp; Casts of The Punjab &amp; North-West Frontier Province", 1911 AD, Page 217, Vol. III, Published by Asian Educational Services&lt;/ref&gt; and Haroon Rashid.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Pathans by Haroon Rashid Published by Haroon Rashid, 2002 Item notes: v. 1 Page 45 Original from the University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Resistance against the Mughals===
The [[Afridis]] and their allies [[Khalils]]  were first mentioned in the [[Baburnama|memoirs]] of Mughal Emperor [[Babur|Babar]] as violent  tribes in need of subduing.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Beveridge, ''Babor-nama'' London, 1922 [repr. 1969], p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; The Afridi tribes controlled the Khyber Pass, which has served as a corridor connecting the [[Indian subcontinent]] with [[Afghanistan]] and Central Asia. Its strategic value was not lost on the Mughals to whom the Afridis were implacably hostile.&lt;ref name = "Agent"&gt;[http://grove.com.pk/clients/Khyber/History.php ''History of Khyber Agency: Gateway to the Subcontinent''], Office of the Political Agent, Khyber Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of Mughal rule, Emperors [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]] and [[Emperor Jahangir|Jahangir]] both dispatched punitive expeditions to suppress the Afridis, to little success.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Kieffer, [http://www.khyber.org/tribes/info/Afridi__Iranica.shtml ''Afridi''], Encyclopædia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afridis once destroyed two large [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] armies of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]: in 1672, in a surprise attack between [[Peshawar]] and [[Kabul]], and in the winter of 1673, in an ambush in the mountain passes.&lt;ref name=richards /&gt; The emperor himself had to lead an army into the mountains to suffocate the revolt and liberate the mountain passes and even then, another large army was "badly mauled" in Bajaur.&lt;ref name=richards&gt;{{citation |title= The Mughal Empire |chapter= Imperial expansion under Aurangzeb 1658–1869.

===Resistance against the British===

{{unreferenced|date=July 2018|section}}
The British connection with the Adam Khel Afridis commenced immediately after the annexation of the Peshawar and Kohat districts. Following the example of all the previous rulers, the British agreed to pay the tribe a subsidy to protect the pass. However, in 1850, 100p Afridis attacked a body of British sappers engaged in making a road, killing 12 and wounding 6. It was supposed that they disliked the construction of a road. An expedition of 3200 British troops was despatched, which traversed the country and punished them.

When the Afridis of the [[Kohat Pass]] resisted, the Jowaki Afridis offered the use of their route instead; but they turned out more aggressive than the others, and in 1853, a force of 1700 British traversed their country and destroyed their stronghold at Bori.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1854, the Aka Khels Afridis, not finding themselves admitted to a share of the allowances of the Kohat Pass, commenced a series of raids on the Peshawar border and attacked a British camp. An expedition of 1500 troops entered the country and inflicted severe punishment on the tribe, who made their submission and paid a fine. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1877, the British government proposed to reduce the Jowaki allowance for guarding the Kohat Pass, and the tribesmen showed their resentment of this by cutting the telegraph wire and raiding into British territory. A force of 1500 troops penetrated their country in three columns in the [[Jowaki Expedition]] and did considerable damage by way of punishment. However, the attitude of the Jowakis continued the same, and their raids into British territory went on. A much stronger force, therefore, of 7400 British troops, divided into three columns, in 1877 and 1878, destroyed their principal villages and occupied their country for some time, until the tribe submitted and accepted government terms. The Kohat Pass was afterwards practically undisturbed. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

At the time of the British advance into Afghanistan in 1878, during the [[Second Afghan War]], the Zakka Khel opposed the British advance and attacked their outposts. A force of 2500 British troops traversed their country, and the tribesmen made their submission. The Afridis of the [[Khyber Pass]] continued to cause the British trouble during the progress of the Second Afghan War so another force of 3750 British troops traversed their country, and after suffering some loss the tribesmen made their submission. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1897, Afridis suddenly rose, captured all the posts in the Khyber held by their own countrymen and attacked the forts on the [[Samana Range]] near the city of [[Peshawar]]. The [[Tirah Expedition]] of the British forces followed, and negotiations for peace were then begun with the Afridis, who, under the threat of another expedition into Tirah in spring 1898, at length agreed to pay the fines and surrender the rifles demanded. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In February 1908, [[Bazar Valley Campaign|the restiveness of the Zakka Khel again made a British expedition necessary]], but the campaign was speedily ended. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Cuisine==
{{See also|Pashtun cuisine}}
Meat is an important part of their diet, which they often eat in the form of [[kabab]] (minced meat fried in oil), lamb [[curry]], chicken curry or goat curry. The hotels in Peshawar Namak Mandi Bazar represent the traditional food of Afridis, especially lamb karahi. In vegetarian cuisine, traditional [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] ingredients such as ''bindi'' ([[okra]]), ''rajma'' ([[kidney beans]]), ''dal'' ([[lentils]]) and ''sag'' ([[spinach]]) are notably eaten. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Albert Friedländer was born in [[Berlin]], where he owned the prestigious private bank "Bankhaus Friedländer Berlin". He also served as chairman of the Berlin stock exchange association (''Deutscher Börsenverein'') in Berlin. In 1920, he married Luise Charlotte Henriette Emma Peters.&lt;ref&gt;''Berlin, Germany, Marriages, 1874-1920''&lt;/ref&gt; They later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Friedlander in ''Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Immigration Cards, 1900-1965''&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing hardship as a Jew, Friedländer immigrated to [[France]] in 1934. After the occupation of much of the country by German troops, he was imprisoned in 1940 but managed to escape to [[Switzerland]] in 1942, where he acquired citizenship and settled in [[Zürich]] to become a writer. He lived there until his death in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;''Switzerland, Jewish Arrivals, 1938-1945''&lt;/ref&gt;

was the name of a class of [[courtesan]]s or female entertainers in [[History of Muslim Egypt|Arab Egypt]], women educated to sing and recite classical poetry and to discourse wittily, connected to the ''[[qayna]]'' slave singers of [[pre-Islamic Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stavros Stavrou Karayanni| title = Dancing Fear and Desire: Race, Sexuality, and Imperial Politics in Middle Eastern Dance| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=InjIw3lWQTUC&amp;pg=PA29| year = 2004| publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press| isbn = 978-0-88920-926-8| pages = 28–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, ''almeh'' came to be used as a synonym of [[ghawazi]], the erotic dancers of [[Dom people|Dom]] ethnicity whose performances were banned in 1834 by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]. As a result of the ban, the ghawazi dancers were forced to pretend that they were in fact ''awalim''. 
Transliterated into French as ''almée'', the term came to be synonymous with "[[belly dancer]]" in European [[Orientalism]] of the 19th century.

'''Anti-organized crime institutions in Russia''' are being developed. Since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], [[organized crime]] has taken control of many major sectors of Russia's state economy, society, and government. Most initiatives and institutions developed against organized crime groups have failed.  Others, that have managed to remain standing, struggle in having any influence over the groups or cannot stop them, thus sitting idly without the ability to influence any crime. Due to the Russian government's continuous failure to curb organized crime, other nations such as the [[United States]] have tried to intervene and assist it in finding strategies.

Organized crime does not have a set definition that is recognized worldwide because every nation defines organized crime by different terms depending on their perceptions of variables such as culture and policy. In [[Russia]], organized crime is defined by [[law enforcement]] authorities as, "... an organized community of criminals ranging in size from 50 to 1,000 persons, which is engaged in systematic criminal business and protects itself from the law with the help of corruption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime: Global Organized Crime Project|year=1997|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-293-2|page=24|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) in the United States defines organized crime as "... a self-perpetuating, structured and disciplined association of individuals or groups, combined together for the purpose of obtaining monetary or commercial gains or profits, wholly or in part by illegal means, while protecting their activities through a pattern of graft and corruption." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime: Global Organized Crime Project|year=1997|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-293-2|page=23|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federico Varese, a Professor in [[Criminology]] at the [[University of Oxford]], offers yet another view of organized crime, particularly pertaining to mafia groups, "a mafia group is a particular type of organized crime that specializes in one particular commodity [...] protection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varese|first=Federico|title=The Russian Mafia: Private Protection in a New Market Economy|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The [[Communist]] Soviet Union collapsed after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] tried to open the country via his policies of [[perestroika]] (1986) and [[glasnost]] (1988). While his actions brought the Soviet Union out of isolation from the international community, the initiatives are also seen as a failure because he tried to implement them too quickly. The shift from a state-run economy to a market economy was not gradual, it was abrupt. The nation was not ready for such a quick, drastic change. [[File:Gorbachev (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|right|Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 before the onset of perestroika and glasnost]] The new [[Russian Federation]] was forced into a [[market economy]] after decades of suppression and an entirely state-run economy. The new Russian state government did not have experience with democracy and could not smoothly transition to a democracy ''and'' market economy at the same time. Laws for this new type of state were not in place and when the government tried to enact some, they proved to be very hard to enforce as the population also did not yet understand how democracy and a market economy functioned. The chaos and fear that now plagued the Russian state opened the doors to a large increase in crime.

Vladimir Volkov, an Associate Professor of [[Sociology]] at the [[European University at St. Petersburg]], cites some useful [[statistical data]] showing the immense upward trend of crime in the new Russian state, "... in 1986 the [[militia]] registered 1,122 cases of [[extortion]] in Russia, in 1989 the number jumped to 4,621".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Volkov|first=Vadim|title=Violent Entrepreneurs: The Use of Force in the Making of Russian [[Capitalism]]|year=2002|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|location=[[Ithica]] and [[London]]|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996 there were a registered total of 17,169 cases of extortion. This number included ''only'' cases that were reported and responded to by militia; it is unknown how many cases were unreported. On the other hand, 1996 also saw crime plateau. The following years and in present day, there are not as many groups (although the groups that do exist are extremely powerful).&lt;ref name="volkov4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Volkov|first=Vadim|title=Violent Entrepreneurs: The Use of Force in the Making of Russian [[Capitalism]]|year=2002|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|location=[[Ithica]] and [[London]]|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Phil Williams showed the drastic increase in crime groups after the Soviet Union's collapse, "... Russia has increased from 3,000 [criminal organizations] in the early 1990s to over 8,000 at the end of 1995...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Phil|title=Russian Organized Crime: The New Threat?|year=1997|publisher=FRANK CASS|location=London, England|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With unsuccessful attempts at stifling organized crime, organized crime groups took control of a significant amount of large, vital, and previously state-owned corporations and businesses. Organized crime groups interrogated and exploited private business owners. If a business owner refused to agree to pay a crime group to protect his business, the crime group would simply kick him out of his own business or, as in the majority of cases,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} murder him and then take over the business themselves.

By the mid-1990s the Russian government realized that some type of effective action was needed if it wanted to avoid losing the entire Russian economy and society to organized crime groups. Hence, initiatives and decrees began to be developed and implemented, although with little success.

[[File:State-Duma.jpg|thumbnail|The State Duma in Moscow, Russia.]]

== Government ==
In the beginning of their struggle with organized crime, Russia did not try to seek foreign assistance. In recent times, however, it has actively sought foreign help to fight organized crime groups in the country. Even with aid, organized crime remains a serious problem. In fact, aid has offered very little actual help as programs are hard to follow through with and are usually simply dropped.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government, the first government of the new democratic Russian state, was unable to curb crime in the administration. Instead it later turned out that almost all major government agencies and personalities had been linked to organized crime and/or corruption in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime: Global Organized Crime Project|year=1997|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-293-2|page=66|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian government does not have the resources or dedicated individuals to combat crime. The State [[Duma]] has long been discussing legislative proposals but response has been weak. Due to the inability of the state to extinguish the criminal organizations, the population no longer trusts the government to get the protection they need. In fact, citizens can only depend on the organized crime groups to get any effective protection anymore of their homes, families, and businesses.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Even official law enforcement agents have begun to partner up with the organized crime groups, because doing so has become one of the best ways to make money and stay safe.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) ===
[[File:UBOP Valor in Service MVD.jpg|thumbnail|Russian Federation, Ministry of the Interior (MVD), Medal "For Valor in Service" of the Department for Combating Organized Crime.]]
The [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]] is the government agency in charge of combating organized crime. The agency has been around long before the collapse of the Soviet Union. A few of its branches include the ''militsiya'', the tax police, and the Organized Crime Control Department. The MVD always participates in any crime related investigations or actions in the Duma. Few members of the MVD have been known to be collaborators with organized crime.

=== Federal Security Service ===
The [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) is the post-communist version of the Committee on State Security ([[KGB]]). They, like the MVD, and the KGB did, work against organized crime in Russia. Often the MVD and the FSB work hand-in-hand to try to stop crime. On the other hand, many FSB officials have been known to be corrupted and collaborating with organized crime groups.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Anti-crime decrees ===

==== In the first Yeltsin Administration ====
By the mid-1990s Yeltsin's administration began to create some programs to try to alleviate their state of their organized crime problem. In 1995 then President Yeltsin met with the [[Security Council of Russia]] to hear reports administered by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) on the status of organized crime in the state.&lt;ref name="Ibid"&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime: Global Organized Crime Project|year=1997|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-293-2|page=67|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results were obviously negative, showing a lot of crime with little enforcement against it. In a meager attempt to address the issue, Yeltsin ordered more funding and coordination among judicial bodies against organized crime. Nothing ever happened with this initiative.

Later in 1995 Yeltsin made a very controversial attempt against crime. He created his own anti-crime law which allowed "... the police broad authority to search premises, seize documents, investigate finances, and hold, for up to 30 days, people suspected of organized crime activity." &lt;ref name="Ibid" /&gt;

In July, the State Duma allowed the expansion of the amount of government agencies who could make investigations. Also in July, the Duma passed a law called "On Fighting Organized Crime" containing descriptions of what organized crime is and which organized crime groups are involved, along with 60 extra articles.&lt;ref name="webster68"&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime: Global Organized Crime Project|year=1997|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-293-2|page=68|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was signed in by Yeltsin in 1996. Within its 60 articles it outlined how many years of prison organized crime groupmembers, government officials, and participants in organized crime should receive upon conviction. By the next year the new law seemed to disappear from memory and again nothing strict was being done about organized crime.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===== Regional Anti-Organized Crime Directorate =====
The Regional Anti-Organized Crime Directorate (RUBOP, RUOP, or UBOP) was created in 1992 to track and suppress organized crime groups. Several such regional anti-organized crime directorates were set up all over the country. These directorates served as "an elite police force with extraordinary powers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Volkov|first=Vadim|title=Violent Entrepreneurs: The Use of Force in the Making of Russian [[Capitalism]]|year=2002|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|location=[[Ithica]] and [[London]]|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; RUBOP also maintained a database of all listed organized crime groups and the individuals who participated in them. In 1996, however, the database was sold to private hands and was no longer updated.&lt;ref name="volkov4"/&gt;

==== Initiatives by Alexander Lebed ====
[[File:Evstafiev-general-alexander-lebed17oct96.jpg|thumbnail|Aleksandr Lebed]]
General [[Aleksandr Lebed]] was the Security Council secretary in the Yeltsin administration. Lebed was a die-hard advocate of anti-organized crime institutions. Although he was quickly dismissed after Yeltsin became aware of a circulating rumor in 1996 of a potential military coup, Lebed enforced quite a few initiatives.&lt;ref name="webster68"/&gt;

Lebed implemented new powers for his secretary position of the Security Council:&lt;ref name="webster69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime: Global Organized Crime Project|year=1997|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-293-2|page=69|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The secretary of the Security Council was granted permission to bring notice to the president of any high-ranking official suspected of corruption.
# The secretary was given the authority to investigate all high-ranking officials to be elected and present the information to the president.
# The secretary of the Security Council was given the permission to review draft [[presidential decree]]s with other members of the Security Council.
Furthermore, Lebed forced Yeltsin to sign into law a decree, that amongst other things, allowed for [[sting operations]] against Moscow-area crime lords. The decree also included the following anti-organized crime actions:&lt;ref name="webster69"/&gt;
[[File:Vladimir Putin-2.jpg|thumbnail|Vladimir Putin]]
# The "rapid deployment unit" division was given an additional 19,000 men to patrol streets.
# The special tax police, a branch of the MVD, was given an extra 1,000 men.
# Moscow's criminal court system acquired 650 new judges.
# Corrupt officials would be temporarily removed from their office until proven not guilty.
# The establishment of a program to protect witnesses, judges, and prosecutors from harm during the entirety of their trial.

==== The Putin Administration ====
[[Vladimir Putin]] has been a key government player since at least the year 2000. He is also an ex-FSB prime minister. When he was elected President in 2000 the first thing Putin did was grant himself and his family immunity from being prosecuted or investigated under the Presidential Decree Number 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime and Corruption: Putin's Challenge : Global Organized Crime Project|pages=|year=2000|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-372-6|author2=Borgachev Arnaud. De |author3=Frank J. Cillufo }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Putin created a new security agency to fight organized crime called the Federal Service for the Investigation of Fight against Corruption (FSRBK). At the same time, in 2000, Putin threatened all Internet traffic when he authorized [[SORM-2]], an eavesdropping network, to monitor all [[Internet traffic]] in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime and Corruption: Putin's Challenge : Global Organized Crime Project|page=2|year=2000|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-372-6|author2=Borgachev Arnaud.

== Helping suppress Russia's crime: the United States ==
[[File:1800 K Street.JPG|thumbnail|right|Center for Strategic and International Studies 1800 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006]]
The [[United States]] has been trying to help Russia find ways to battle organized crime groups since the early 1990s. However, its initiatives have tended to fall through because no one follows up after agreements or plans are made.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Also, the Russian Federation often assured the United States that the crime was being taken care of successfully. The United States did not investigate the validity of that claim but just believed organized crime issues were truly being resolved.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Since the 1990s, the United States government had steadily began to realize that Russia has been misguiding it. Hence, in recent times the United States has taken stronger action to assist Russia against organized crime.

=== Center for Strategic and International Relations ===
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is located in [[Washington, D.C.]] It was established in 1962 and concentrates on international public policy issues. CSIS seeks to analyze global challenges and shape policy decision in government and the private sector.

==== Russian Organized Crime Task Force Report 1997 ====
The following summary was compiled by the Russian Organized Crime Task Force, and published by CSIS, to assist the United States in proceeding with future assistance to the Russian government as they struggle to battle organized crime. Although the summary was compiled in 1997, the same recommendations still stand today.

Summary of Recommendations ''for'' the United States Government&lt;ref name="webster53"&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime and Corruption: Putin's Challenge : Global Organized Crime Project|pages=53–55|year=2000|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-372-6|author2=Borgachev Arnaud. De |author3=Frank J. Cillufo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list has been copied from the Russian Organized Crime and Corruption: Putin's Challenge : Global Organized Crime Project Report, 2000 &lt;ref name="webster53"/&gt;

# Russian organized crime (ROC) should receive public recognition from the president of the United States as a national security threat.
# The development of a free market in Russia founded on the [[rule of law]] should be recognized as the only long-term policy solution to the ROC problem and must be central to all U.S. policy decisions.
# In order to mitigate instances of corruption within the Russian government, U.S. policies and actions should shift from support for political personalities to support for segments of the Russian government that are working to usher in the rule of law. Strengthening the rule of law will foster the emergence of a viable [[market economy]] in Russia, free from the coercion and extortion activities of ROC groups.
# Russia must work toward the creation of a strong and impartial judiciary to implement and enforce a fair body of civil, criminal, and contact law to regain control over the [[adjudication]] role currently played by ROC groups.
# U.S. support for reform should reinforce training and exchanges such as those currently in place, funded through the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], the [[State Department]], the Justice Department, and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID). These programs, as well as similar efforts within the private sector and the academic community, should be continued and expanded through appropriate funding by the [[United States Congress]].
# A similar effort should be undertaken in the private sector to support the legitimate regulation of Russian industry, business, and trade. Specifically, the Russian government should be assisted in establishing uniform business operation regulations, professional standards for certain industries, and requirements for the issuance and regular renewal of business licenses and other permits.
# Stringent requirements to ensure transparency in Russia's use of foreign aid, multilateral loans and export financing should be implemented and enforced to insulate the funds from organized crime (OC) and to ensure that the funds reach their intended destinations.
# The United States should initiate a discussion at the level of the Summit of the Eight of an investment treaty to deny export credits to Western firms doing business with OC-controlled firms in Russia.
# Because ROC activity requires a response from various U.S. government agencies with multiple roles and missions, decisions about whether prosecution or foreign policy objectives take precedence should be made on a case-by-case basis.
# Because businesspersons often become the targets of ROC activity, a greater effort should be made to provide them with relevant information. The Foreign Commercial Service of the Department of Commerce, in conjunction with the Overseas Security Advisory Committee of the Department of State, should work with other U.S. agencies and the Russian government to advise and support businesspersons, providing them especially with alternatives to paying extortion to criminal elements in Russia.
# A shared [[public database]] on ROC, including a collation of declassified and open-source materials, should be created to assist investors from the United States and other countries. The database could be supplemented by a classified database for use by U.S. government agencies only. Considering the transnational breadth of ROC activity, a database supporting intelligence sharing among various groups like the [[Group of Eight]] (G-8), [[European Police Office]] (EUROPOL), and the "six nation group"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime and Corruption: Putin's Challenge : Global Organized Crime Project|page=54|year=2000|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-372-6|author2=Borgachev Arnaud. De |author3=Frank J. Cillufo }}, footnote 129.; The "six nation group" includes the United States, [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Russia]].&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the transnational aspects of the ROC threats is also necessary.
# The U.S. intelligence community must be directed to fill the immense intelligence gaps on ROC. Their elements should use well-tested operational know-how and tradecraft to recruit informants inside ROC or induce defections from the various ranks of people who can provide hard inside knowledge of how the various ROC elements operate, do not operate, cooperate, and do not cooperate.
# The interpenetration of Russian officialdom, businesses, and criminal organizations makes it more lucrative than ever that U.S. law enforcement and [[intelligence agencies]] fully cooperate and share the fruits of their respective disciplines to serve U.S. policy, security, and commercial interests more capably.
# Close U.S. government identification with corrupt elements of Russia's political establishment risks serious popular backlash inside Russia. The United States must avoid the appearance of unqualified support for what is routinely seen as a kleptocratic establishment. Such linkage reinforces a growing popular perception that democratic political and market economic systems are merely code words for rapacious criminality. The United States should address this perception by increasing its [[public diplomacy]] discussion of the causes and cures for ROC.
# The U.S. government must support not only senior-level reformers in the Russian government but reformers outside government as well. The United States should not remain silent in the face of official hostility toward human rights leaders like [[Sergei Kovalev]] of the Sakharov Foundation or fabricated charges against the environmentalist Captain [[Alexander Nikitin]].

== Conclusion ==

Due to bringing awareness of these suggestions, the Russian Organized Crime Task Force believes the fight against organized crime in Russia is becoming more influential and successful.

Also, in recent times, law enforcement agencies in Russia, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States have tightened coordination and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=William|title=Russian Organized Crime: Global Organized Crime Project|year=1997|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89206-293-2|page=71|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Russia has steadily become more open and accepting of foreign help. Even more, organized crime problems are now being publicly spoken about in the new Russian Federation whereas before any government action or relationship to these criminal groups was kept secret. This opening to the public might be a sign of implementation of stronger actions in the near future.

The '''Bakhtiari''' ({{lang-fa|بختیاری}}) are a southwestern [[Iranian people|Iranian]] tribe,&lt;ref&gt;Curzon, Persia and the Persian Question, London, 1892, II, pp. 273-303.&lt;/ref&gt; and a subgroup of the [[Luri people|Lurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gibb|editor1-first=H.A.R.|editor-link=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|chapter=LUR|date=1954|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-9004060562|page=821|quote="Lur -- an Iranian people living in the mountains in southwestern Persia. As in the case of the Kurds, the principal link among the four branches of the Lurs (Mamasani, Kuhghilu'i, Bakthiari, and Lur proper) is that of language."}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Bakhtiari dialect]], a southwestern Iranian dialect, belonging to the [[Lurish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/bqi|title=Bakhtiâri|work=Ethnologue|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/lori-dialects|title=LORI DIALECTS|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/lori-language-ii|title=LORI LANGUAGE ii.

Bakhtiaris primarily inhabit [[Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province|Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari]] and eastern [[Khuzestan]], [[Lorestan]], [[Bushehr Province|Bushehr]], and [[Isfahan Province|Isfahan]] provinces. In Khuzestan, Bakhtiari tribes are concentrated primarily in the eastern part of the province in the cities of [[Masjed Soleyman]]  and Andekah.

A small percentage of Bakhtiari are still [[nomad]]ic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]]s, migrating between summer quarters (''sardsīr'' or ''yaylāq'') and winter quarters (''garmsīr'' or ''qishlāq'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f5/v3f5a081.html Bakhtiari tribe and the Bakhtiari dialect], Encyclopedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical estimates of their total population vary widely.

==Origins==
In [[Persian mythology|Iranian mythology]], the Bakhtiaris are considered to be descendants of [[Fereydun]], a legendary hero from the [[Persian language|Iranian]] national epic, [[Shahnameh]]. They are also considered to be directly descended from [[Cyrus the Great]]. {{Dubious|date=September 2017}}

===Genetics===
According to research into [[Y-Chromosome|NRY]] markers, the Bakhtiari, as with many other groups in Iran, show very elevated frequencies for [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA]] [[Haplogroup J-M172 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup J2]]—a phenomenon that is probably, at least partially, attributable to the Neolithic diffusion of early farmers [[Demic diffusion|from]] the [[Levant|Near East]] ''c''. 8000–4000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Nasidze"&gt;Nasidze, I., Quinque, D., Rahmani, M., Alemohamad, S. A. and Stoneking, M. (2008), Close Genetic Relationship Between Semitic-speaking and Indo-European-speaking Groups in Iran. Annals of Human Genetics, 72: 241–252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Spencer Wells et al., "The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (August 28, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Southwest Eurasian haplogroups [[Haplogroup F-M89 (Y-DNA)|F]], [[Haplogroup G-M201 (Y-DNA)|G]], and [[Haplogroup T-M184 (Y-DNA)|T1a]] also reach substantial frequency among Bakhtiaris.&lt;ref name="Nasidze" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''bakhtiari'' can be best translated as "companion of fortune" or "bearer of good luck"&lt;ref name="sfu.ca"&gt; [https://www.sfu.ca/~asamsamb/Bakhtiari%20tribe/Bakhtiari%20tribe.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131062946/http://www.sfu.ca/~asamsamb/Bakhtiari%20tribe/Bakhtiari%20tribe.htm |date=January 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has deep Persian roots and is the result of two smaller words ''bakht'' and ''yar'' complied together . ''Bakht'' is the Persian word for "fortune" and ''yar'', ''iar'', ''iari'' literally means "companion".&lt;ref name="sfu.ca"/&gt;

The latter designation largely relates to the nature of the tribe's annual "migration". This has to do with the harsh nature of Bakhtiari life and overcoming of countless difficulties that Bakhtiaris have faced in the Zagros ranges. In this sense, Bakhtiaris view themselves as a hardworking tribe, facing numerous obstacles everyday and yet fortunate enough to overcome each of these challenges as a solid unit.&lt;ref name="sfu.ca"/&gt;

Nevertheless, the origins of Bakhtiaris are ancient and it may have very well been the case that the tribe underwent a series of name changes throughout its history. However It is mostly claimed that the designation "Bakhtiari" came largely into use some time in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Garthwaite., Gene R. Khans and Shahs : a Documentary Analysis of the Bakhtiyari in Iran. NewYork: Cambridge UP, 1933. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''Constitutional Revolution:'''
In Iran's contemporary history, the Bakhtiari have played a significant role; particularly during the advent of the country's [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]] (1905–1907).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakhtiarifamily.com/index.html |title=Bakhtiari Family |publisher=Bakhtiari Family |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was largely secured through the Bakhtari campaign, which eventually deposed [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar]] (r. 1907–1909).&lt;ref name="bakhtiarifamily.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakhtiarifamily.com/constitution.php |title=Constitution |publisher=Bakhtiari Family |date= |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bakhtiari tribesmen, under the leadership of the Haft Lang khans [[Sardar Assad]] and his brother Najaf Qoli Khan Bakhtiari- [[Saad ad-Daula]] (also referred to as Samsam-os Saltane), captured [[Tehran]] and, as a result, saved the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, William O.

'''Pahlavi Period:'''
With the expansion of Bakhtiari influence, urban elites (particularly in Tehran) began to worry in regards to a potential Bakhtiari takeover of Persia's affairs. Prior to this point, the Bakhtiari had largely remained within their own territorial boundaries.
The Bakhtiari influence would continue to play an important role within the early 20th century politics of Iran. [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] (r. 1925–1941) made the destruction of the Bakhtiari influence his mission.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakhtiarifamily.com/oil.php |title=Oil |publisher=Bakhtiari Family |date= |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of oil on Bakhtiari territory further motivated the Pahlavi monarch to undermine the
autonomy of the tribe and force its population to adhere to the commands of the central government. He married as his second wife Soraya Esfandiari Bakhtiari, a member of the Bakhtiari tribe and family in his attempt to pacify the threat. &lt;ref&gt;
Soraya The Autobiography of Her Imperial Highness, Princess Soraya Doubleday &amp; Company, 1963  &lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] would eventually execute a few noteworthy tribal leaders to crush Bakhtiari autonomy and maintain control over the tribe. Amongst the executed Khans was Mohammad Reza Khan (Sardar-e-Fateh), the father of the man who later became the Pahlavi Prime Minister [[Shapour Bakhtiar]].&lt;ref name="iranian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/FaribaAmini/2003/January/Bakhtiar/index.html |title=Shapour Bakhtiar, Fariba Amini |publisher=The Iranian |date= |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter event was a turning point for Bakhtiari and their rise within Iranian politics.&lt;ref name="iranian.com"/&gt;

==Tribal structure==
[[File:A Bakhtiari nomad family.jpg|thumb|A Bakhtiari nomad family]]
The Bakhtiari people are mainly from two tribal divisions, ''Chahar lang'' (English: Four Shares) and ''[[Haft Lang]]'' (English: Seven Shares). ''Lang'' word in bakhtiari dialect means "share of tax or inheritance". Due to the harsh nature of their life style, Bakhtiaris have been able to keep their blood lines intact, largely marrying within their own tribe.

Bakhtiaris trace a common lineage, being divided into the [[Chahar Lang]] (The Four Shares) and [[Haft Lang]] (The Seven Shares) groups, each controlled by a single powerful family. The overall [[Khan (title)|khan]] alternates every two years between the chiefs of the Chahar Lang and the Haft Lang. They were supposed to pay taxes (in previous dynasties) and Haft Lang group had to pay more tax than Chahar Lang group.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The famous documentary ''[[Grass (1925 film)|Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life]]'' (1925) tells the story of the migration of Bakhtiari tribe from winter quarters in Khuzestan to summer quarters Chahar Mahaal. This film also tells the story of how these people crossed the river Karun with 50,000 people and 500,000 animals. The documentary "People of the Wind" (1975) retraces this same journey, 50 years later. The British documentary series "[[The Ascent of Man]]" (1973) in the first part of its second episode, "The Harvest of the Seasons," also shows the Bakhtiari making the annual migration to the summer pastures. This portrayal is not however, particularly positive, using the Bakhtiari as an example of a pre-agricultural tribe frozen in time.  As of 2006, the migration still takes place, although the livestock are now transported in trucks, and the shepherds no longer walk barefoot in the snow between provinces.

'''The Haft Lang:'''
The Haft Lang tribe is larger and much more significant than its Chahar Lang counterpart.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakhtiarifamily.com/overview.php|title=Overview|date=|publisher=Bakhtiari Family|accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Haft Lang are primarily divided into four main sub-divisions, these include; Babadi, Dinaruni, Duraki and Bakhtiarwand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Most prominent Bakhtiaris are from these sub-divisions.

'''Coalition between the two tribes:'''
The two clans shared ruling of their territories every two years.{{Citation needed span|text=The region has other families of Bakhtiari descent but do not belong to the two clans who ruled the region.|date=May 2011}} {{Citation needed span|text=Chahar Lang and Haft Lang have had many marriages between their sons and daughters|date=May 2011}}. {{Citation needed span|text=The Chahar Lang and Haft Lang's are descedent from Sassanian dynasty of Persia.|date=May 2011}} They were also ruled from Isfahan but some moved to south during the fight with the central government and lived in the mountains area of Izeh, Ghalatoul, and Ramhormuz and Masjed-soluman. The Sassani ( Ali-Rahm Khan), Zanganeh ( Sons of Sardar Del-anchin), Rahim-zadeh, Jahangiri (sons of Aziz Khan) family who were mix of the two clans who lived in the area.

==Music==
The Bakhtiari are noted in Iran for their remarkable music which inspired [[Alexander Borodin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ullens de Schooten, Marie-Tèrése. (1956).

The [[Makrani caste|Makrani]] of [[Rajasthan]] are descendants of [[Baloch people|Baloch]] soldiers who were brought as mercenaries. They are still distributed in the former princely states of [[Marwar]], [[Godwad]], and [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]]. 

==History==
These Baloch soldiers came from the [[Makran]] region of [[Balochistan]]. They now speak [[Marwari language|Marwari]] (Rajasthani), while some Makrani also have knowledge of [[Urdu]]. They are one of three communities found in Rajasthan that claim to have originated in Balochistan. The Makrani are now distinct from the [[Rind (Baloch tribe)|Rind]], [[Kurds]], and Korai; other Baloch communities found in Rajasthan. While in Pakistan, the term Makrani now tends to be used as a synonym for the African-descended [[Sheedi people|Siddi]] people of Makran, the Rajasthani Makrani have no connection with the Siddi community.

Bracero workers were selected through a multi-phase process, which required passing a series of selection procedures at Mexican and U.S. processing centers. The selection of bracero workers was a key aspect of the [[bracero program]] between the United States and Mexico, which began in 1942 and formally concluded in 1964. During this time, at least 4.8 million bracero workers entered into official labor agreements with U.S. contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dent|first1=David W.|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Mexico|date=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|pages=23|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_Modern_Mexico.html?id=e4hVAAAAMAAJ&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koulish|first1=Robert|title=Immigration and American Democracy: Subverting the Rule of Law|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|pages=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaKRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=bracero+4.8&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BG0WGdfcen&amp;sig=CBMFrAu6UAlMuLOPSNScLJfvgfM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mYUpVd_pL9fasATti4HwCA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=bracero%204.8&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of selection ==

=== Local selection ===
The first phase of selection for bracero workers took place at a local level in Mexico, which involved gathering required documentation for local officials. In addition to identifying documents, such as birth certificates, potential bracero workers had to obtain recommendations that would attest to their reliability and moral quality.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Deborah|title=Braceros: Migrant Citizens and Transnational Subjects in the Postwar United States and Mexico|date=2011|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men would typically ask for recommendations from high-status local residents, such a politicians, clergy, or business owners.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; While the Mexican government’s publications asserted that required documentation was available free of charge, many aspiring workers had to pay local officials to gather the necessary paperwork and to be considered for selection.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Don|title=They Saved the Crops: Labor, Landscape, and the Struggle Over Industrial Farming in Bracero-Era California|date=2012|publisher=The University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After several weeks of document collection, potential workers would congregate in a designated location, where the mayor and other prominent citizens would go through each man’s documentation and determine who could continue to the next phase of selection.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Deborah|title=Braceros: Migrant Citizens and Transnational Subjects in the Postwar United States and Mexico|date=2011|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person passed this local level of selection, their name would be placed on an official roster.&lt;ref name="Cohen2" /&gt; These potential workers, along with the list, would travel to regional migratory stations.&lt;ref name="Cohen2" /&gt;

=== Regional migratory stations in Mexico ===
People who sought to enter the bracero program would travel to large cities in Mexico, where regional migratory stations comprised the second phase of selection. These processing centers were typically housed in stadiums or other large venues.&lt;ref name="Cohen2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Don|title=They Saved the Crops: Labor, Landscape, and the Struggle Over Industrial Farming in Bracero-Era California|date=2012|publisher=The University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of men would wait outside to hear their name called.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, Leonard. [http://braceroarchive.org/items/show/1469 "Braceros wait in the shade of a building during processing at the Monterrey Processing Center, Mexico"], "[[Bracero History Archive]]" Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials monitored the people waiting outdoors, and some carried weapons, such as a rubber truncheon.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, Leonard. [http://braceroarchive.org/items/show/1446 "An officer, armed with a rubber truncheon, monitors a line of braceros during processing at the Monterrey Processing Center, Mexico"], "[[Bracero History Archive]]" Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Local vendors, many of them women and children, sold concessions outside the processing centers.&lt;ref name="Cohen2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, Leonard.

Vendors, including women and children, sell refreshments in the sun"], "[[Bracero History Archive]]" Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a man heard his name called, he would enter the migratory station.&lt;ref name="Cohen3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Deborah|title=Braceros: Migrant Citizens and Transnational Subjects in the Postwar United States and Mexico|date=2011|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some stations, such as the Francisco Zarco Stadium in Durango City, a potential worker would walk through lines of armed soldiers on both sides when he entered.&lt;ref name="Cohen3" /&gt; Then the applicant would proceed to an interview with local officials.&lt;ref name="Cohen3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, Leonard. [http://braceroarchive.org/items/show/1596 "An official directs a bracero to another station during processing at the Monterrey Processing Center, Mexico"], "[[Bracero History Archive]]" Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials checked to see if the person had agricultural skills and would look at a potential laborer’s hands to see if they were callused, as a sign of their work in fields.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, Leonard. [http://braceroarchive.org/items/show/1641 "An official checks a bracero for callouses at the Monterrey Processing Center, Mexico"], "[[Bracero History Archive]]" Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican women would type up information on bracero applicants at many migratory stations.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, Leonard. [http://braceroarchive.org/items/show/1781 "A typist gives a bracero a document while other are being processed at the Monterrey Processing Center, Mexico"], "[[Bracero History Archive]]" Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosas|first1=Ana Elizabeth|title=Abrazando El Espíritu: Bracero Families Confront the US-Mexico Border|date=2014|publisher=University of California Press|location=Oakland, CA|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. reception centers ===
Potential workers traveled from migratory stations to U.S. reception centers. The method of transportation varied. Some people went to migratory stations on buses, while others traveled on freight trains.&lt;ref name="Cohen98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, Leonard. [http://braceroarchive.org/items/show/1431 "Braceros wait in line to board buses at the Monterrey Processing Center, Mexico"], "[[Bracero History Archive]]" Retrieved 11 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On the trains that did not have restrooms, some aspiring workers fell off moving trains when they leaned out to go to the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Deborah|title=Braceros: Migrant Citizens and Transnational Subjects in the Postwar United States and Mexico|date=2011|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arrival at a U.S. reception center, officials from both U.S. and Mexican health departments would check the hands of potential braceros for calluses, repeating a procedure from the selection phase at migratory centers.&lt;ref name="Cohen98" /&gt; People would proceed to a series of physical inspections, in which they would undress, and a doctor would examine them for venereal disease, illness, and lice.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen98" /&gt; Potential workers would also be x-rayed to test for tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="Cohen98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, Leonard.

Another phase of selection was inspection by U.S. labor contractors.

When workers left the U.S. reception centers, many men would receive a bagged lunch and travel to farms on buses, which were usually old school buses.&lt;ref name="Mitchell221" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen102" /&gt; Some lunches were left behind and were described as virtually inedible.&lt;ref name="Cohen102" /&gt; One ''New York Times'' article reported on a contractor giving bracero workers dog food.&lt;ref name="Cohen102" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Food Pact Is Voided On ‘Dog Meat’ Charge|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 8, 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican men that did not pass the selection process at U.S. reception centers were sent back to Mexico.&lt;ref name="Cohen103"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Deborah|title=Braceros: Migrant Citizens and Transnational Subjects in the Postwar United States and Mexico|date=2011|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them had exhausted their financial resources acquiring the necessary documents to become a bracero worker, so numerous people returned home with little to no money.&lt;ref name="Cohen103" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosas|first1=Ana Elizabeth|title=Abrazando El Espíritu: Bracero Families Confront the US-Mexico Border|date=2014|publisher=University of California Press|location=Oakland, CA|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chibcha''' is an [[Extinct language|extinct]] language of [[Colombia]], spoken by the [[Muisca]], one of the four advanced [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous]] civilizations of the Americas. The Muisca inhabited the central highlands ([[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]) of what today is the country of Colombia.

The name of the language '''''Muysccubun''''' or ''muyskkubun'' in its own language means "language of the people" or "language of the men", from ''muyska'' / ''muysca'' ("people" or "men") and ''kubun'' / ''cubun'' ("language" or "word").&lt;ref name=QuickGuide&gt;{{es}} [http://muysca.cubun.org/Gram%C3%A1tica/Muisca_gu%C3%ADa_r%C3%A1pida Quick guide ''muysccubun'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Important [[List of Muisca scholars|scholars]] who have attributed to the knowledge of the Chibcha language were [[Juan de Castellanos]], [[Bernardo de Lugo]], [[José Domingo Duquesne]] and [[Ezequiel Uricoechea]].

== History ==
[[File:Chibchan languages distribution.png|thumb|right|500px|Distribution of Chibchan languages across southern Central and northwestern South America]]
In prehistorical times, in the [[Andean civilization]]s called [[Andean preceramic|preceramic]], the population of northwestern [[South America]] happened through the [[Darien Gap]] between the [[isthmus]] of [[Panama]] and Colombia. Other [[Chibchan languages]] are spoken in southern [[Central America]] and the Muisca and related indigenous groups took their language with them into the heart of Colombia where they settled in their [[Muisca Confederation]].

=== Spanish colonization ===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca}}
{{see also|Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations}}
As early as 1580 the authorities in Charcas, [[Quito]], and [[Bogotá|Santa Fe de Bogotá]] mandated the establishment of schools in native languages and required that priests study these languages before ordination. In 1606 the entire clergy was ordered to provide religious instruction in Chibcha. The Chibcha language declined in the 18th century.&lt;ref name = "wdl"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chibcha Dictionary and Grammar | work = [[World Digital Library]] | accessdate = 2013-05-23 | url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8988/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1770, [[King]] [[Charles III of Spain]] officially banned use of the language in the region &lt;ref name="wdl"/&gt; as part of a de-indigenization project. The ban remained in law until Colombia passed its [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|constitution of 1991]].

=== Modern history ===
Modern [[List of Muisca scholars|Muisca scholars]] have investigated ''Muysccubun'' and concluded that the variety of languages was much larger than previously thought. The quick colonization of the Spanish and the improvised use of traveling translators has reduced the differences between the versions of Chibcha over time.&lt;ref&gt;Gamboa Mendoza, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 an online Spanish-Muysccubun dictionary containing more than 2000 words is online. The project was partly financed by the [[University of Bergen]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref name=MuisDic&gt;{{es}} Diccionario muysca - español. Gómez, Diego F. 2009 - 2017 [http://muysca.cubun.org/Categor%C3%ADa:Diccionario More than 2000 words in the Chibcha language]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Numeracion Muisca.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Numbers 1-10 and 20 in Chibcha]]
The ''muysccubun'' alphabet consists of around 20 letters. The Muisca didn't have an "L" in their language. The letters are pronounded more or less as follows:&lt;ref name=sara_p10&gt;Saravia, 2015, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sara_p11&gt;Saravia, 2015, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''a''' - as in Spanish "casa"; '''ka''' - "enclosure" or "fence"&lt;br&gt;
'''e''' - as in "'''''a'''''ction"; '''izhe''' - "street"&lt;br&gt;
'''i''' - open "i" as in "''''''i'''''nca" - '''sié''' - "water" or "river"&lt;br&gt;
'''o''' - short "o" as in "b'''''o'''''x" - '''to''' - "dog"&lt;br&gt;
'''u''' - "ou" as in "y'''''ou'''''" - '''uba''' - "face"&lt;br&gt;
'''y''' - between "i" and "e"; "a" in action - '''ty''' - "singing"&lt;br&gt;
'''b''' - as in "'''''b'''''ed" - '''bohozhá''' - "with"&lt;br&gt;
:between the vocals "y" it's pronounced [βw] - '''kyby''' - "to sleep"
'''ch''' - "sh" as in "'''''sh'''''ine", but with the tongue pushed backwards - '''chuta''' - "son" or "daughter"&lt;br&gt;
'''f''' - between a "b" and "w" using both lips without producing sound, a short whistle - '''foï''' - "mantle"&lt;br&gt;
:before a "y" it's pronounced [ɸw] - '''fyzha''' - "everything"
'''g''' - "gh" as in "'''''g'''''ood" - '''gata''' - "fire"&lt;br&gt;
'''h''' - as in "'''''h'''''ello" - '''huïá''' - "inwards"&lt;br&gt;
'''ï''' - "i-e" as in Beelzebub - '''ïe''' - "road" or "prayer"&lt;br&gt;
'''k''' - "c" as in "'''''c'''''old" - '''kony''' - "wheel"&lt;br&gt;
'''m''' - "m" as in "'''''m'''''an" - '''mika''' - "three"&lt;br&gt;
:before "y" it's pronounced [mw], as in "Muisca" - '''myska''' - "person" or "people"
:in first position before a consonant it's pronounced [im] - '''mpkwaká''' - "thanks to"
'''n''' - "n" as in "'''''n'''''ice" - '''nyky''' - "brother of sister"&lt;br&gt;
:in first position followed by a consonant it's pronounced [in] - '''ngá''' - "and"
'''p''' - "p" as in "'''''p'''''eople" - '''paba''' - "father"&lt;br&gt;
:before "y" it's pronounced [pw] as in Spanish "'''''pue'''''nte" - '''pyky''' - "heart"

'''zh''' - as in "'''''ch'''''orizo", but with the tongue to the back - '''zhysky''' - "head"

The accentation of the words is like in Spanish on the second-last syllable except when an accent is shown: '''''Bacata''''' is Ba-CA-ta and '''''Bacatá''''' is Ba-ca-TA.

In case of repetition of the same vocal, the word can be shortened: '''fuhuchá''' ~ '''fuchá''' - "woman".&lt;ref name=sara_p11/&gt;

In Chibcha, words are made of combinations where sometimes vocals are in front of the word. When this happens in front of another vowel, the vowel changes as follows:&lt;ref name=sara_p12&gt;Saravia, 2015, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
'''a'''-'''uba''' becomes '''oba''' - "his (or her, its) face"&lt;br&gt;
'''a'''-'''ita''' becomes '''eta''' - "his base"&lt;br&gt;
'''a'''-'''yta''' becomes '''ata''' - "his hand" (note: '''ata''' also means "one")

Sometimes this combination is not performed and the words are written with the prefix plus the new vowel:
'''a-ita''' would become '''eta''' but can be written as '''aeta''', '''a-uba''' as '''aoba''' and '''a-yta''' as '''ayta'''

=== Numbers ===
{{main article|Muisca numerals}}
Counting 1 to 10 in Chibcha is ''ata, bozha, mika, myhyká, hyzhká, ta, kuhupkwá, suhuzhá, aka, hubchihiká''.&lt;ref name=sara_p12/&gt; The Muisca only had numbers one to ten and the 'perfect' number 20; ''gueta'', used extensively in their complex [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] [[Muisca calendar]]. For numbers higher than 10 they used additions; ''hubchikiká asaqui ata'' ("ten plus one") for eleven. Higher numbers were multiplications of twenty; ''gue-hisca'' would be "twenty times five"; 100.

== Structure and grammar ==

=== Subject ===
The subjects in Chibcha do not have genders nor plurals. '''to''' thus can mean "male dog", "male dogs", "female dog" or "female dogs". To solve this, the Muisca used the numbers and the word for "man"; '''cha''' and "woman"; '''fuhuchá''' to specify gender and plural:&lt;ref name=sara_p14&gt;Saravia, 2015, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''to cha ata'' - "one male dog" (literally: "dog" "male" "one")
* ''to cha mika'' - "three male dogs" ("dog male three")
* ''to fuhuchá myhyká'' - "four female dogs"

=== Verbs ===
The Muisca used two types of verbs, ending on '''-skua''' and '''-suka'''; '''bkyskua''' ("to do") and '''guitysuka''' ("to whip") which have different forms in their [[grammatical conjugation]]s.&lt;ref name=QuickGuide/&gt; '''bkyskua''' is shown below, for verbs ending on '''-suka''', see [[:es:Conjugación de verbos muiscas#Segunda conjugación|here]].

== Surviving words and education ==
Words of ''Muysccubun'' origin are still used in the departments of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] of which [[Bogotá]] is the capital, and the department of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], with capital [[Tunja]]. These include ''curuba'' (Colombian fruit [[banana passionfruit]]), ''toche'' ([[yellow oriole]]), ''guadua'' (a large bamboo used in construction) and ''tatacoa'' ("snake"). The Muisca descendants continue many traditional ways, such as the use of certain foods, use of ''[[coca]]'' for teas and healing rituals, and other aspects of natural ways, which are a deep part of culture in Colombia.

As the Muisca did not have words for specific things in early colonial times, they borrowed them from Spanish, such as "shoe"; ''çapato'',&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} Diccionario muysca - español. Gómez, Diego F. 2009 - 2017 [http://muysca.cubun.org/zapato "Shoe" in ''muysccubun'']&lt;/ref&gt; "sword"; ''espada'',&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://muysca.cubun.org/espada "Sword" in ''muysccubun'']&lt;/ref&gt; "knife"; ''cuchillo''&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} Diccionario muysca - español. Gómez, Diego F. 2009 - 2017[http://muysca.cubun.org/cuchillo "Knife" in ''muysccubun'']&lt;/ref&gt; and other words.

The only public school in [[Colombia]] currently teaching Chibcha (to about 150 children) is in the town of [[Cota, Cundinamarca|Cota]], about {{convert|30|km|mi}} by road from Bogotá. The school is named ''Jizcamox'' (healing with the hands) in Chibcha.

=== Toponyms ===
{{main article|List of Muisca toponyms}}
Most of the original Muisca names of the villages, rivers and national parks and some of the provinces in the central highlands of the Colombian [[Andes]] are kept or slightly altered. Usually the names refer to farmfields (''ta''), the Moon goddess [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]], her husband [[Sué]], names of ''[[cacique]]s'', the [[topography]] of the region, built enclosures (''ca'') and animals of the region.&lt;ref name=excelsio&gt;{{es}} [http://www.excelsio.net/2011/11/sabe-el-origen-del-nombre-de-su.html Etymology Municipalities Boyacá] - Excelsio.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chileans in the Falkland Islands''' are people of [[Chile]]an ancestry or nationality who live in the [[Falkland Islands]]. The Chilean community on the Falklands are the biggest population from mainland [[South America]] and also the biggest non-British group{{efn-ua|According to the 2012 census, the bigger groups were Falkland Islanders, from the UK or other [[British Overseas Territories]], such as [[Gibraltar]] and [[St. Helena]].&lt;ref name = census2012/&gt;}} representing over 6% of the total population according to the 2012 census,&lt;ref name = census2012/&gt; although the true number may be higher as many islanders of Chilean origin listed their national identity as '[[Falkland Islander]]' and Chileans working on the islands temporarily were not counted in the census.&lt;ref name="MercoPress"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=13 February 2012 |title=Chilean community in Falklands plan to write a letter to President Piñera |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/02/13/chilean-community-in-falklands-plan-to-write-a-letter-to-president-pinera |newspaper=[[MercoPress]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A Chilean [[consulate]] was established on the Falklands in the 1870s and remained well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="MercoPress2"/&gt; The first Chileans to arrive on the Falklands in large numbers came in the late 1970s, mainly from [[Punta Arenas]] and other parts of the [[Magallanes Region]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diario.latercera.com/2012/02/05/01/contenido/pais/31-99583-9-jon-benjamin-por-que-puede-reabrirse-este-asunto-territorial-y-no-otro.shtml |title=Jon Benjamin: "¿Por qué puede reabrirse este asunto territorial y no otro?"|author=[[Waldo Diaz]] |date=1 May 2012 |website=[[La Tercera]] |language = Spanish|publisher= |accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 28 permanent Chilean residents listed in the 1980 census. Following the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, Argentine nationals were banned from visiting the Falklands until the 1990s, which led to many Chileans (whose government had supported the UK during the war) moving to the Falklands to take up jobs previously held by Argentines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1983/jan/31/falkland-islands |house=House of Commons |date=31 January 1983 |speaker=[[Cranley Onslow]] |position=vol 36 cc29-30W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permanent Chilean population remained fairly stable until the start of the 21st century when Chileans remaining on the islands for longer than 6 years rose to over 100.&lt;ref name="2006 census"/&gt; According to the 2012 census, there were 161 Chilean residents (82 women and 79 men) in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] and [[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp]], representing more than 10% of the civilian population, with an addition 20 Chileans listed as working at [[RAF Mount Pleasant]], bringing the total number to 181 (6.2% of the total population).&lt;ref name = census2012/&gt;

The 2006 census indicated that about 157 Islanders had Chilean ancestry, nine were [[British Chilean]], ten were of Falkland Islands-Chilean ancestry, there was one of [[Brazilian Chilean]] ancestry and another was [[Spanish Chilean]].&lt;ref name="2006 census"/&gt;

==Population==
The population speaks [[Chilean Spanish]] and [[Falkland Islands English]] and are prominently [[Roman Catholic]]. Most reside in Stanley, with a small number living in Camp and RAF Mount Pleasant. The influence of the Chileans can be felt in the local food with some bars serving typical Chilean cuisine and the islands receive most [[Television in Chile|Chilean TV]] channels. [[Chilean Independence]] Day is also celebrated on the Falklands and since 2010 festivities have taken place with the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Governor]] at [[Government House, Falkland Islands|Government House]].&lt;ref name="MercoPress2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://en.mercopress.com/2013/10/02/falklands-chilean-residents-celebrate-national-day-and-strong-links-with-chile | title=Falklands Chilean residents celebrate National Day and strong links with Chile | work=[[MercoPress]] | date=2 October 2013| accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main link between the Falklands and Chile is the weekly [[LAN Airlines]] between [[RAF Mount Pleasant]], [[Punta Arenas]] and [[Santiago de Chile]]. The flights have been stopped for periods, most notably in 1999 when the Chilean Government banned the flight in protest to the UK's [[indictment and arrest of Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://falklandstimeline.wordpress.com/1983-1999/ |title=The Falkland Islands – History &amp; Timeline |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=wordpress.com |publisher= |accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekly flight is also the only link between the islands and mainland South America and has become increasingly important since 2011 when the members of [[Mercosur]] banned Falklands flagged vessels from entering their ports in support of [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|Argentine's claim to the islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mercosur supports Argentina: bans access to all Falklands/Malvinas flagged vessels |author= |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2011/12/21/mercosur-supports-argentina-bans-access-to-all-falklands-malvinas-flagged-vessels |newspaper=[[MercoPress]] |date=21 December 2011 |accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[Argentine President]] [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]] threatened to ban flights to the Falklands from flying over Argentine [[airspace]], which led to protests by Chileans in the islands and Chile itself against Kirchner's proposals.&lt;ref name="MercoPress"/&gt;

Chileans who have lived on the islands for more than seven years are entitled to apply for [[Falkland Islands status]], considered to be the closest thing to citizenship that the Falkland Islands can grant, giving them full residency rights - although in order to vote they need to hold British, Irish or Commonwealth citizenship. Although the current Chilean government supports Argentine's sovereignty claim to the Falklands, the majority of the Chilean population on the islands and Mainland Chile support the [[Falkland Islanders]]' right to [[self-determination]]&lt;ref name="MercoPress"/&gt; and in 2017 the Chilean-born [[Leona Vidal Roberts]] was [[Falkland Islands general election, 2017|elected]] to the [[Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Niebieskikwiat |first= Natasha |date=2017-11-09 |title=Una chilena será legisladora de las Islas Malvinas |trans-title=A Chilean will be a legislator from the Falkland Islands |url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/nacio-chile-llego-nina-malvinas-hoy-compite-legisladora-islas_0_ryK0aC-kf.html |language=Spanish |work=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] |location= |access-date= 2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partially at the behest of the [[international community]], [[Nauru]]’s government no longer sanctions certain activities that, while technically legal, could serve to facilitate criminal activity. In 2003, it ended the controversial practice of selling its [[passports]]. It also banned [[offshore bank]]s. In 2005, Nauru was still placed on the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering's (FATF)]] List of Non-Cooperative Countries (NCCTs). A division of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the FATF was created in 1989 to address global concerns over the proliferation of [[money laundering]]. A generally low rate of [[petty crime]] in Nauru has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.countrywatch.com/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&amp;vcountry=122&amp;topic=PONAS{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''culture of Kashmir''' refers to the [[culture]] and [[traditions]] of [[Kashmir]], a region in northern [[India]] (consisting of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]), northeast [[Pakistan]] (consisting of [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit–Baltistan]]) and the Chinese Occupied territory of [[Aksai Chin]].

The culture of Kashmir is a diverse blend and highly influenced by northern South Asian, Persian as well as Central Asian culture. Along with its scenic beauty, Kashmir is famous for its cultural heritage; it amalgamates Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist philosophies and has involved composite culture based on the values of humanism and tolerance which is collectively known as ''[[Kashmiriyat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lisindia.net/Kashmiri/Kash_cult.html Kashmiri Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh each have their own distinct culture.

==Background==

===Kashmir===
[[File:Kashmiri man.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gujjar]] man from Kashmir]]
One of the most important parts of the cultural identity of the [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri people]] is the [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri (Koshur)]] language. This language is spoken only in the [[Kashmir Valley|Valley of Kashmir]] by the [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s and [[Kashmiri Muslims]]. Besides language, [[Kashmiri cuisine|Wazwan]] and culture has been greatly influenced by Central Asian and Persian culture. Kashmiri is an Indo-Aryan ([[Dardic languages|Dardic]] subgroup) language close to Central Asian Avestan-Persian. Cultural music and dance like ''Wanvun'', ''Roaff'', carpet/shawl weaving |Kaleenbafi and ''Koshur Sufiana'' forms a very important part of Kashmiri identity. Kashmir has witnessed many spiritual gurus who migrated from their land to Kashmir. Kashmir has also even witnessed the birth of some of the great poets and suifs of all time like ''Lal Daed, Sheikh-ul-Alam'', Habba Khatoon and many more; and is regarded as Peer Vaer (a place or land of spiritual gurus). It is important to note that Kashmiri culture is predominantly followed only in the Kashmir valley and Doda of the Chenab region. Jammu and Ladakh have their own distinct cultures that are very different from that of Kashmir.

The ''Dumhal'' is a famous dance in the Kashmir valley, performed by men of the Wattal region. The women perform the Roaff, another traditional folk dance. Kashmir has been noted for its fine arts for centuries, including poetry and [[Kashmiri handicrafts|handicrafts]]. ''[[Shikaras]]'', traditional small wooden boats, and [[houseboat]]s are a common feature in various lakes and rivers across the Valley. Kashmiri culture is defined in terms of religious values, [[Kashmiri language]], literature, cuisine and traditional values of mutual respect. The overwhelming majority of Kashmiris are Muslims and Islamic identity plays a very important role in the daily lives of people. Kashmiris across the religious divide have for centuries shared cordial and friendly ties. Kashmiri poets and writers like Mehjoor, Abdul Ahad Azad, etc. enriched the literature with their poetry. Kashmiri cuisine holds a unique place among different world cuisines. Salted tea or [[Noon Chai]] also called [[Sheer Chai]] is the traditional drink and is cooked in a Samavar, a Kashmiri tea-pot.  Kashmir has been noted for its fine arts for centuries, including poetry and handicrafts. ''[[Shikaras]]'', traditional small wooden boats, and [[houseboat]]s are a common feature in various lakes and rivers across the Valley. ''Kehwa'', traditional green tea with spices like cardamom, Saffron and almond, is served on special occasions and festivals. Kashmiri weddings are regarded incomplete without the Kashmiri traditional food known as [[Wazwan]], which is typically spicy food cooked by the traditional cooks (Waz). Wazwan is a multi-course meal in which almost all the dishes are meat-based.

===Ladakh===

Culture of Ladakh is famous for its unique [[Culture of India|Indo]]-[[Tibetan culture]]. Chanting in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan language]] forms an integral part of Ladakh's Buddhist lifestyle. Annual masked dance festivals, [[weaving]] and [[archery]] are an important part of traditional life in Ladakh. Ladakhi food has much in common with [[Cuisine of Tibet|Tibetan food]], the most prominent foods being [[thukpa]], noodle soup; and [[tsampa]], known in Ladakhi as ''Ngampe'', roasted barley flour. Typical garb includes gonchas of velvet, elaborately embroidered waistcoats and boots, and gonads or hats. People, adorned with gold and silver ornaments and turquoise headgears throng the streets during various Ladakhi festivals.

===Jammu===

Jammu's Dogra culture and tradition is very different from the Kashmiri culture. The Dogra culture is instead much similar to that of neighbouring [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Traditional Punjabi festivals such as [[Lohri]] and [[Baisakhi]] are celebrated with great zeal and enthusiasm throughout the region, along with [[Accession Day (Jammu and Kashmir)|Accession Day]], an annual holiday which commemorates the accession of Jammu &amp; Kashmir to the Dominion of India.&lt;ref name = "Vijay Kumar"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/jk-accession-day-to-be-celebrated-as-diwali-bjp/702249/|title=J-K Accession Day to be celebrated as Diwali: BJP|publisher=[[Rediff]]|accessdate =2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dogras, ''[[Gujjar]]s'' form the second-largest ethnic group in Jammu. Known for their semi-nomadic lifestyle, Gujjars are also found in large numbers in the Kashmir valley. Similar to Gujjars, ''Gaddis'' are primarily herdsmen who hail from the Chamba region in Himachal Pradesh. Gaddis are generally associated with emotive music played on the [[flute]]. The ''Bakkarwala''s found both in Jammu and the outskirts of the Vale of Kashmir are wholly nomadic pastoral people who move along the Himalayan slopes in search for pastures for their huge flocks of goats and sheep.

==Cuisine==
{{Main article|Kashmiri cuisine}}
Kashmir has a variety of meat based dishes like Rogan Josh, a lamb dish. Wazwan is a multi-course dish which is served on occasions like weddings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11027">'''The [[demographics]] of [[Togo]]''' include [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[population density]], age, education level, health, economic status and religious affiliation.

==Language and ethnicity==
[[Togo]]'s population of {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Togo}}|,||}}/1e6 round 2}} million people ({{UN_Population|Year}} est.) is composed of about 21 ethnic groups, the two biggest being the [[Ewe (people)|Ewe]] in the South (about 21% of the population) and the [[Kabye people|Kabye]] in the North (12% of the population). [[Dagomba language|Dagomba]] is the second most common language in the north, where other [[Gur languages]] such as [[Mossi language|Mossi]] and [[Gourma]] are also found.

The ethnic groups of the coastal region, particularly Ewe and [[Gen language]] (or Mina) (the two major African languages in the south), constitute the bulk of the civil servants, professionals, and merchants, due in part to the former colonial administrations which provided greater infrastructure development in the south. Most of the southern peoples use these two closely related languages, which are spoken in commercial sectors throughout Togo. 

The Kabye live on marginal land and traditionally have emigrated south from their home area in the Kara region to seek employment. Their historical means of social advancement has been through the military and law enforcement forces, and they continue to dominate these services.

Other groups include the [[Akposso]] on the Central Plateau, the [[Ana people]] who are related to the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and live in the center of the country, in the strip between [[Atakpame]] and [[Tchamba]], the [[Bassar]] in the Centre-West, the [[Cotocoli]], the [[Tchamba]] and the [[Komkombas]] around [[Sokodé]], the [[Lambas]] in the [[Kandé]] region, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], the [[Tamberma]], the [[Losso]] and the [[Ouachi]]. 

[[White Africans of European ancestry|White African settlers]] descended from the original French and German colonials make up less than 1% of the total population along with Togo's minute [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] community. The remaining 99% are indigenous: most people in this category hail from one of thirty-seven different tribes.

==Population==
Population distribution is very uneven due to soil and terrain variations. The population is generally concentrated in the south and along the major north-south highway connecting the coast to the Sahel. Age distribution is also uneven; nearly one-half of Togolese are less than fifteen years old. 

French, the official language, is used in administration and documentation. The public primary schools combine [[French language|French]] with Ewe or Kabye as languages of instruction, depending on the region. [[English language|English]] is spoken in neighboring [[Ghana]] and is taught in Togolese secondary schools. As a result, many Togolese, especially in the south and along the Ghana border, speak some English.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Omaha]], Nebraska,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msbusiness.com/2004/07/physician-j-edward-hill-readies-for-role-as-president-of-ama/|title=Physician J. Edward Hill readies for role as president of AMA|author=Lynne W. Jeter|work=[[Mississippi Business Journal]]|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill was educated in the public schools of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] and received both his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] and [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degrees from the [[University of Mississippi]]. 

==Career==
A [[board certified]] family physician, Hill began his professional career in the rural [[Mississippi Delta]] where he practiced for 27 years. In addition to his full-service family practice, Hill developed and directed a local maternal child health program that resulted in lowering the fetal mortality rate from one of the highest in the United States to below the national average, where it remained. Hill was asked in January 1995 to become the director of the Family Practice Residency Program at [[North Mississippi Medical Center]], which is the nation's largest rural hospital. 

===AMA president===
In a speech entitled "Understanding, Advocacy, Leadership: The AMA Perspective on LGBT Health," Hill became the first president of the [[American Medical Association|AMA]] to address the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]].  
{{quotation|I know that [[Gay and lesbian medical association|GLMA]] members and [[:Category:LGBT physicians|LGBT physicians]] have been treated unfairly by the AMA in the past. There is simply no excuse for discriminatory actions or exclusions based on sexual orientation or gender identity -- none. First, [[Gay and lesbian medical association|GLMA]] has opened [the AMA's] eyes to the diverse needs of LGBT patients, and second -- and just as important -- GLMA has told patients that they have the right to expect a health care system filled with openness, fairness and equality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/15741.html AMA (GLBT) News release from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;|Dr. Edward Hill, M.D., president [[American Medical Association]]}}
His speech is considered by some as an historic turning point in the policy of the AMA's towards LGBT physicians after the events at [[New York Medical College]] during the tenure of the previous AMA president [[John Nelson (physician)|Dr. John Nelson]].

[[Image:Elopement-A Hasty Descent.jpg|thumb|A humorous, staged photograph (circa 1904) depicting an attempted elopement with [[cliché]]d ladder to the prospective bride's upstairs bedroom. The bride has fallen down the ladder, knocking over her beau and waking her father.]]

To '''elope''', most literally, means to run away and to not come back to the point of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/elope elope].&lt;/ref&gt; More colloquially, '''elopement''' is often used to refer to a [[marriage]] conducted in sudden and secretive fashion, usually involving a hurried flight away from one's place of residence together with one's beloved with the intention of getting married.

Today the term "elopement" is colloquially used for any marriage performed in haste, with a limited public engagement period or without a public engagement period. Some couples elope because they wish to avoid objections from parents, or religious obligations. In addition, the term elopement is used in psychiatric hospitals to refer to a patient leaving the psychiatric unit without authorization.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Examples==

===United Kingdom===
In [[England]], a legal prerequisite of marriage is the "reading of the [[banns]]"—for the three Sundays prior to the intended date of the ceremony, the names of every couple intending marriage has to be read aloud by the priest(s) of their parish(es) of residence, or the posting of a 'Notice of Intent to Marry' in the registry office for [[Civil ceremony|civil ceremonies]]. The intention of this is to prevent [[bigamy]] or other unlawful marriages by giving fair warning to anybody who might have a legal right to object.{{Citation needed|date= December 2011}} In practice, however, it also gives warning to the couples' parents, who sometimes objected on purely personal grounds. To work around this law, it is necessary to get a special licence from the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]—or to flee somewhere the law did not apply, across the border to [[Gretna Green]], [[Scotland]], for instance.

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], elopement is called "tanan". Tanan is a long-standing practice in Filipino culture when a woman leaves her home without her parents' permission to live a life with her partner. Usually she will elope during the nighttime hours and is awaited by her lover nearby, who then takes her away to a location not of her origin. The next morning, the distraught parents are clueless to the whereabouts of their daughter. Tanan often occurs as a result of an impending arranged marriage or in defiance to parents' dislike of a preferred suitor.

There are various '''ethnic groups in [[Senegal]]''', none of which forms the ethnic majority in the country. Many subgroups of those can be further distinguished, based on religion, location and language. According to one 2005 estimate, there are at least twenty distinguishable groups of largely varying size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atlas du Sénégal|publisher=Éditions J. A.|location=Paris|year=2007|pages=72–73|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:OuolofCayor.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wolof people|Wolof]] of [[Cayor]] (1890 engraving)]]

*The largest group is the [[Wolof people|Wolof]], representing 43.3% of the population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook:Senegal|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live predominantly in the west, having descended from the kingdoms of [[Cayor]], [[Waalo]] and [[Kingdom of Jolof|Jolof]] that once existed in that area. Their population is focused in large urban centres. Most are [[Muslim]], being either [[Mouride]] or [[Tijaniyyah|Tijānī]]. The [[Lebou people]] of [[Cap-Vert]] and [[Petite Côte]] are considered a subgroup of the Wolof{{Dubious|date=March 2012}}, however they represent less than 1% of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peuples du Sénégal|publisher=Éditions Sépia|year=1996|page=182|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of the Wolof both linguistically and politically has continued to increase throughout the years; this tendency has been called the "wolofisation" of Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Donal Cruise O'Brien|title=Langues et nationalité au Sénégal. L'enjeu politique de la wolofisation|journal=Année Africaine|year=1979|pages=319–335|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Fula people|Fula]], those who speak the [[Fula language]], are the second most populous group, representing 23.8% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook:Senegal|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This figure includes the [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleurs]], but according to surveys, this subgroup is sometimes considered separate from the Fula. They were Islamized very early.  The territory inhabited by the Fula is larger than that of the Wolof, however many areas are sparsely populated, such as [[Ferlo]], [[Kolda Region|Kolda]], the [[Senegal River Valley]], and [[Badiar]]. Traditionally [[nomad]]ic, the vast majority has [[Sedentism|become sedentary]], although there is a current [[rural exodus]]. Since [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] became president of [[Guinea]], many Guinean Fula have immigrated to Senegal, particularly from [[Fouta Djallon]].
*The third group is the [[Serer people|Serer]], who represent 14.7% of the national population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook:Senegal|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serer pre-colonial kingdoms included : the [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Biffeche]] and previously the [[Kingdom of Baol]] (ruled by the [[Joof family]]). [[Serer history (medieval era to present)|Serer medieval history]] is characterized by resisting [[Islamization]] from the 11th century (during the [[Almoravids]]' advance) to the 19th century (the [[Marabout]] wars of Senegambia), resulting in [[the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune]], commonly known as the Battle of Somb. The Serer anti-French movement during the colonial era resulted in [[the Battle of Logandème]]. The [[Serer people]] includes, but not limited to : the [[Saafi people|Saafi]], [[Serer-Ndut people|Ndut]], [[Serer-Laalaa|Laalaa]], [[Niominka people|Niominka]], [[Palor people|Palor]], etc. Many of these speak the [[Cangin languages]].

[[Image:BailaBoukout2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|On the way to a [[boukout]] in [[Baïla]] in [[Jola people|Jola]] country]]
*The [[Jola people|Jola]] represent 5% of the country's population, and mostly live in [[Ziguinchor Region|Ziguinchor]] where they primarily make their living from rice cultivation and fishing. Traditionally [[Animism|animist]], they have historically resisted the spread of both [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Christian Roche|title=Histoire de la Casamance : Conquête et résistance 1850-1920|publisher=Karthala|year=2000|pages=408|isbn=978-2-86537-125-9|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the Jola population now adheres to either Islam or Christianity, many mix these religions with animist beliefs. The Jola hold their ethnic distinctiveness as of great importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jean-Claude Marut|title=Le problème casamançais est-il soluble dans l'Etat-nation?|journal=Le Sénégal Contemporain|publisher=Karthala|location=Paris|year=2002|pages=425–458|isbn=978-2-84586-236-4|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Other groups also live in the Ziguinchor Region. While these groups lead lifestyles that are very similar to the Jola, they speak different languages and are much less populous. This is the case of the [[Bainuk people|Bainuk]], the [[Balanta people|Balanta]], the [[Manjack people|Manjack]], the [[Mankanya people|Mankanya]], the [[Karoninka people|Karoninka]], and the [[Bandial people|Bandial]].
*Several small ethnic groups in Senegal are related to the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]], together constituting 4% of the population of the country. These include the [[Malinké]], the [[Sossé people|Sossé]], the [[Bambara people|Bambara]], the [[Dyula people|Dyula]], the [[Yalunka people|Yalunka]], and the [[Jakhanke people|Jakhanke]].
*The [[Soninke people|Soninke]] represent 0.5% of the population of Senegal. While most of the Soninke live in [[Mali]], some live on the other side of the border, along the [[Falémé River|Falémé]] and [[Sénégal River]]s. This group has been experiencing a significant [[diaspora]]. The Soninke were Islamized earlier than most other groups in the country.

A few [[Bassari people|Bassari]] and [[Bedick]] live in the hills in eastern Senegal around [[Kédougou]]. These are subgroups of the [[Tenda people|Tenda]], same as the [[Coniagui people|Coniagui]] and the [[Badiaranké people|Badiaranké]].

*Senegal has among its population many Africans from other countries. There are small [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian]] communities in [[Dakar]], as well as many [[Nigeria]]ns, most of which being [[Hausa people|Hausa]]. Malians go almost unnoticed in Senegal because their culture is so similar to that of the Senegalese. There is a large [[Cape Verdeans in Senegal|Cape Verdean community in Dakar]]. [[Moors]], constituting 0.5% of the population of Senegal, have long invested in business in the country, residing mainly in cities in the north. The subgroup of the [[Darmankour people|Darmankour]], who have lived in Senegal for centuries, are present throughout the country.

[[Europe]]ans and [[Lebanese people in Senegal|descendants of Lebanese migrants]] are fairly numerous in urban centres in Senegal, about 50,000.

==Minor groups==
There are also many other smaller representations of other ethnic groups in Senegal, including the [[Khassonké]], the [[Lawbe people|Lawbe]] and the [[Papel people|Papel]].

There are also small [[Chinese people in Senegal|Chinese]] and [[Vietnamese community in Senegal|Vietnamese migrant]] communities.

==Commonality==
The predominant ethnic groups in Senegal share a common cultural background so that, apart from their languages that also have many similarities, there are no effective cultural barriers between them. {{dubious|date=November 2011}} This is why [[marriage]] between ethnic groups in Senegal is so common.{{or|date=November 2011}}

'''''Glamorous Night''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book and music by [[Ivor Novello]] and lyrics by [[Christopher Hassall]], Novello's collaborator in six of the eight Novello musicals staged between 1935 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Novello wrote the lyrics for ''Perchance to Dream'' himself, when Hassall was in the army, and Alan Melville wrote the lyrics for ''Gay's the Word''&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Glamorous Night'' was the first of several Novello musicals in the 1930s given an expensive, spectacular production, with several scene changes and a large cast, including many extras and dancers.  Scenes included villas on a suburban street where a horse-drawn carriage was driven, the set of an operetta performed in the fictional country of Krasnia, shipboard skating and assassination scenes, the sinking of the ship, a bustling gypsy wedding and a Royal ballroom.&lt;ref&gt;"Concerts &amp; c.", ''The Times'', 30 May 1936, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical was first performed in London in 1935. In 1937 it was adapted as a [[Glamorous Night (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Mary Ellis]] and [[Otto Kruger]].

== Productions ==
''Glamorous Night'' was produced by Ivor Novello.  The musical opened at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London on 2 May 1935 to robust ticket sales, but had a limited run due to the pre-booking of a [[pantomime]] at the theatre. It then toured in the British provinces before re-opening at the [[London Coliseum]] in May 1936 for another short run, for a total of 234 London performances.  The role of Anthony Allen was played by Novello, and that of the gypsy (Militza Hajos) was played by [[Mary Ellis]].  It was directed by [[Leontine Sagan]], with choreography by [[Ralph Reader]].  The plot echoed current events in Rumania, where the king was willing to give up his reign to marry a [[Romani people|Romany]] actress, Mme. Lupesco.&lt;ref&gt;Ellacott, Vivyan. [http://www.overthefootlights.co.uk/London%20Musicals%201935-1939.pub.pdf "London Musicals 1935-1939"], ''Over the Footlights'', accessed 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A movie was made of ''[[Glamorous Night (film)|Glamorous Night]]'' in 1937, with [[Barry MacKay (actor)|Barry MacKay]] taking the role of Anthony Allen, [[Otto Kruger]] as King Stephen and Mary Ellis reprising her stage role of Militza.

The show was briefly revived in November 1975 at the [[New London Theatre]], and was part of a UK tour.  It was directed by Alexander Bridge and starred [[John Hanson (singer)|John Hanson]] and Pamela Field.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Ian. [http://issuu.com/ianparsons/docs/1975musicals "''Glamorous Night'' (Revival)"], Overthefootlights.com, London musicals:1975, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16726">A '''grievance''' is a formal [[complaint]] that is raised by an employee towards an employer within the workplace. There are many reasons as to why a grievance can be raised, and also many ways to go about dealing with such a scenario. Reasons for filing a grievance in the workplace can be as a result of, but not limited to, a breach of the terms and conditions of an [[employment contract]], raises and promotions, or lack thereof, as well as [[harassment]] and [[employment discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/problems-at-work/dealing-with-grievances-at-work/#h-what-is-a-grievance|title=Dealing with grievances at work - Citizens Advice|website=www.citizensadvice.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sean C. Doyle, in his work titled, ''The Grievance Procedure: The Heart of the Collective Agreement'', the grievance process takes on certain secondary roles in countries such as Canada, United States and the United Kingdom that can include, but are not limited to, "a mechanism for the extension of the relationship between the parties, a union tactic to pressure management for strategic purposes, a diagnostic device to uncover underlying problems in the workplace, a mechanism for individual employees or union officials to challenge management over a range of working conditions, or even a forum for the communication of information".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grievance Procedure: The Heart of the Collective Agreement|last=Doyle|first=Sean|publisher=Industrial Relations Centre|year=1999|isbn=0-88886-521-X|location=Kingston, Ontario|pages=|quote=|url=http://irc.queensu.ca/sites/default/files/articles/the-grievance-procedure-the-heart-of-collcetive-agreement.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A grievance between an employee and employer can be dealt with either informally or formally, and sometimes both approaches are taken in search of a resolution. In the informal approach, an employee can informally bring forth a concern promptly to his or her employer. Here a discussion or similar between the two parties can result in a mutually agreed upon resolution. In the case that this step fails or is skipped altogether, a grievance can be raised formally, where formal meetings and options for appeals become available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-02-14|title=Raising a grievance at work {{!}} Acas advice and guidance|url=http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplaces that have [[trade union]] representation often file a grievance with an employer on behalf of an individual employees request. According to the ''Union of Northern Workers'', "Grievances are filed by the union on behalf of its members. Most of the grievances filed by unions are filed on behalf of individual employees (individual grievances) or on behalf of a group of employees (group grievances). A third type of grievance is the policy grievance which deals with issues that affect all employees".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unw.ca/grievances-and-arbitrations|title=Grievances and Arbitrations {{!}} UNW|website=www.unw.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to Labour Law==
In the majority of cases, a grievance in a workplace is filed due to a breach of labour law. Though labour law can be different from country to country, there is a general understanding of this particular laws meaning and relationship to employees and employers. According to Peter Ackers and Adrian Wilkinson in their work titled, Understanding Work and Employment: Industrial Relations in Transition, labour law involved items can include, "the contract of employment, regulatory legislation (such as health and safety measures), the conduct of industrial disputes, and questions of trade union government".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Work and Employment: Industrial Relations in Transition|last=Ackers|first=Peter|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Adrian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=138|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going further, these authors also note the concern of labour law with three relationships in particular, that include, "the relationship between the employer and the worker (a relationship rooted in contract - the contract of employment); the relationship between the employer and the trade union (a relationship rooted in tort - interference with trade, business or employment by unlawful means); and the relationship between the trade union and the worker (a relationship rooted in contract - the contract of membership)".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Though all three relationships are very different, they are all highly connected, especially in a situation where a grievance is filed by an employee or a union.

==Benefits of a Grievance==
Above all else, a grievance is a procedure that allows for peace of mind, since knowing that there is a procedure in place to challenge questionable decisions that are made by others in the workplace is available. A grievance allows for an opportunity at conflict management with ideals such as fairness and equity at its forefront.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Employees are able to have their say at all levels of management, with the opportunity to escalate to an independent arbitrator if necessary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While there are benefits for employees, management benefits from the presence of a grievance process as well. As Sean C. Doyle states in his work titled, ''The Grievance Procedure: The Heart of the Collective Agreement'', this is due to the fact that, "the process represents an excellent means for achieving consistency in policy formulation and application and can ensure compliance with corporate policy by middle management and supervisors since their decisions are subject to the grievance procedure and will be reviewed by their superiors".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To be more specific, the grievance process often encourages the workplace contract to be quite specific, therefore it will encompass several events that can occur on a day-to-day basis. This creates clear expectations on both the part of an employee and employer, with the hope of a quick, but fair resolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As for the union, a grievance procedure can act as a way to nurture trust and loyalty between employee and the union. Since a grievance is usually a process that is supported by both employee and employer, there is always an understanding that this will be the route taken for conflict resolution within the workplace. When action must be taken, the union can play a significant role in the grievance process, and for this reason, it is important that they achieve a fair settlement for their clients, who are the employees, in order to gain further support and in some cases, re-election for company union representation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Disadvantages of a Grievance==
Though the grievance process does provide for a structured and often fair procedure to dealing with conflicts within the workplace, there are also certain disadvantages present. In some cases, employees and employers alike can see the inclusion of a third-party arbitrator as a way in which they lose specific rights or control over the situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another more obvious disadvantage is the use of time and money, which are both valuable resources to an organization. Often, a grievance does take a substantial amount of time to be completed, and therefore there is plenty of time used, while costs incurred during the investigation, and in particular through the inclusion of a third-party arbitrator can quickly add up. Another common disadvantage amongst employee and employer has to do with the notion of expectation. For instance, one party may prefer a quick resolution, while another may prefer to take their time and conduct a thorough investigation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ultimately a grievance process takes the attention of both the employee and employer away from their main roles in a workplace and shifts them elsewhere, while tensions between both parties can also form, resulting in future toxic environments or feelings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==International Approaches==
===Grievance Process in Canada and the United States===
Grievance procedures can differ slightly from province to province, or state to state, though the process itself is quite similar whether it occurs in [[Canada]] or the [[United States]].

Most grievance cases feature a three to four step process. In a workplace that features a union structure, grievances begin with an employee bringing forth a particular issue or issues to their direct management source (usually in writing) within a specified period following the particular infraction. The issue is then in the hands of management who now has a specific period to respond personally or escalate the issue further to a higher authority. At this point, and sometimes even prior, a union representative enters the situation (if such structure exists) on behalf of the employee. If the situation cannot be resolved in an informal manner, or the preliminary stages of a formal grievance, the case is usually brought to an independent arbitrator. Since this is in many cases a last step in the process, the decision of an arbitrator is usually seen as final. A step that must be mutually agreed upon and one that is not always usual in the process is presenting the grievance to a mediator, who can assist the two or more sides solve their disagreement without having to go to arbitration. Mediation tends to cost both sides far less in terms of finances and time as opposed to the arbitration process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/g/grievance-procedures/|title=Grievance Procedures Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=definitions.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important piece of the grievance process in Canada and the United States revolves around timelines that must be met to ensure that a grievance remains active. Time limits are not always set, but they are in most cases, and this is why this is an important factor to highlight. In Canada for instance, a grievance must be filed within twenty five days of the occurrence being reported to a secondary party.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ceiu-seic.ca/en/support/stewards-guides/standard-procedure-individual-grievances/|title=Standard procedure, individual grievances » CEIU - Canada Employment and Immigration Union|newspaper=CEIU - Canada Employment and Immigration Union|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time limit excludes weekends and holidays that would usually be paid. An employer is required to respond to a grievance within ten days of its initial receipt. In many cases, if these set time limits are not adhered to, a grievance can be nullified. It is acceptable for an employee and employer to mutually agree upon extending certain deadlines past the above noted days allowable, though it is recommended to do so in writing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Grievance Process in the United Kingdom===
The process of a grievance in the United Kingdom is not significantly different than the process used in Canada and the United States, however, the process will be outlined below.

A grievance filed by an employer or employee should be submitted in writing. The next step involves a meeting between employee and employer. It is a statutory right for an employee to be able to bring a companion, but not just anyone, there are stipulations here; the companion must be a member of the union representing the employee, fellow co-worker or similar. If an employer or employee is unsatisfied following the meeting, there will be an opportunity to appeal the decision. In some cases, an appeal is held in-house by an impartial individual who may be employed by the same organization but had no previous involvement or bias in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures|last=|first=|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=2009|isbn=978 0 11 706728 8|location=Norwich, England|pages=|quote=|via=http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/k/b/Acas_Code_of_Practice_1_on_disciplinary_and_grievance_procedures-accessible-version-Jul-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Grievance Cases in Canada==
===Pate Estate v. Harvey (Township)===
If not done correctly, workplace dismissal and the way in which it is handled can result in a grievance being filed. This specific case highlights a case of dismissal gone wrong. In 2009, the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] rewarded a wrongfully dismissed employee named John Gordon Pate $550,000 in damages for his March 1999 dismissal.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2013/2013onca669/2013onca669.html|title=Pate Estate v. Galway-Cavendish and Harvey (Township), 2013 ONCA 669 (CanLII)|last=|first=|date=|website=CanLII|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Pate was Chief Building Official of the Corporation of the Township of [[Galway-Cavendish-Harvey, Ontario|Galway-Cavendish]] from 1989 until December 31, 1998.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Township of Galway-Cavendish had dismissed Mr. Pate based on an issue with his handling of building permit fees. The Township went one step further and asked the [[Ontario Provincial Police|OPP]] to look into the matter and potentially lay criminal charges. This request by the township to the provincial police was well-received and led to a four-day long criminal trial. This trial ended in the dismissal of the former employees original charges.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casselsbrock.com/CBNewsletter/Top_10_Employment_and_Labour_Law_Cases_in_2013|title=Cassels Brock : Top 10 Employment and Labour Law Cases in 2013|website=www.casselsbrock.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this particular ordeal, Mr. Pate in turn sued the Township for wrongful dismissal as well as [[malicious prosecution]]. He won on both charges. In November 2013, the [[Ontario court of appeal|Ontario Court of Appeal]] lowered the amount of damages awarded to Mr. Pate to $450,000.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Wilson v. Solis Mexican Foods Inc.===
This specific case involves an employee named Patricia Wilson and her employer Solis Mexican Foods. According to the specific case subsection on the ''Cassels Brock Lawyers'' website, "This was the first Ontario court decision to award damages under the Human Rights Code." &lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casselsbrock.com/CBNewsletter/Top_10_Employment_and_Labour_Law_Cases_in_2013|title=4. Wilson v. Solis Mexican Foods Inc., 2013 ONSC 5799|last=|first=|date=|website=Cassels Brock Lawyers|publisher=|access-date=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an assistant controller with the company as of January 2010, until the date of termination. A letter dated May 19, 2011 advised Ms. Wilson that she would be terminated due to the sale of a sector of the business that made several existing positions within the company superfluous.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2013/2013onsc5799/2013onsc5799.html|title=Wilson v. Solis Mexican Foods Inc., 2013 ONSC 5799 (CanLII)|website=CanLII|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to termination, Ms. Wilson, through her doctor had requested time off of work, dated March 7, 2011, in order to heal a recurring back issue. On March 28, 2011, once again through her doctor, Ms. Wilson informed her employer that she would be able to return to work on modified duties that included 4 hour work days beginning the week of April 4, with the promise of full 8 hour days commencing by April 18. The employer found this to be unacceptable and requested further information, which was promptly provided. One final twist in the lead up to the dismissal includes an unexpected letter from Ms. Wilson's doctor, which was dated April 28, 2011, simply stating that her client would need to be off of work until June 15, 2011. The case transcripts do not provide any further communication between this last request and the time of termination.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The specific case subsection on the ''Cassels Brock Lawyers'' website outlines the decision of this case when it states that, "The Ontario Superior Court awarded $20,000 to the employee after finding that her ongoing back problems and related requests for accommodation were a factor in the employer’s decision to terminate, despite the employer’s argument that her termination was part of a corporate reorganization."&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

The '''Harari people''' ({{lang-ar|هراري}}, [[Harari language|Harari]]: ሐረሪ), also called '''Geyusu''' (Harari: ጌይኡሱእ) ("People of the City"), are an ethnic group inhabiting the [[Horn of Africa]]. Members traditionally reside in the city of [[Harar]], situated in the [[Harari Region]] of eastern [[Ethiopia]]. They speak [[Harari language|Harari]], a member of the [[Ethiopian Semitic|Ethiosemitic]] language group within the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]].

Due to severe violation of Harari rights during Abyssinian rule, Hararis made several attempts to cut ties with Ethiopia and unify [[Hararghe]] with [[Somalia]].

Some of the Hararis themselves assert descent from [[Abadir Umar ar-Rida]], also known as ''Fiqi Umar'', who traced his lineage to the [[Rashidun Caliphate|first caliph]], [[Abu Bakr]]. According to the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]], "Fiqi Umar" crossed over from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the [[Horn of Africa]] ten generations prior to 1854, with his six sons: Umar the Greater, Umar the Lesser, the two Abdillahs, Ahmad and Siddik.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Burton, ''First Footsteps in East Africa'', 1856; edited with an introduction and additional chapters by Gordon Waterfield (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hararis, they also consist of seven Harla subclans: Abogn, Adish, Awari, Gidaya, Gaturi, Hargaya, and Wargar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wehib|first1=Ahmed|title=History of Harar and the Hararis|date=October 2015|publisher=Harari People Regional State Culture, Heritage And Tourism Bureau|page=29|url=http://www.everythingharar.com/files/History_of_Harar_and_Harari-HNL.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harari were previously known as ''"Adere"'', although this term is now considered derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yimam|first1=Baye|title=Ethiopian studies at the end of the second millennium|date=2002|publisher=Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa University|page=930|url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=-91yAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=adere|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harari people speak the [[Harari language]], an [[Ethiosemitic]] language referred to as ''Gey Ritma'' or ''Gey Sinan'' ("Language of the City"). It is closely related to the eastern [[Gurage languages]] and similar to [[Zay language|Zay]] and [[Silt'e language|Silt'e]].

After the Egyptian conquest of Harar, numerous [[loanword]]s were additionally borrowed from [[Egyptian Arabic]]. The Harari language was historically written using the [[Arabic script]]. More recently, it has been transcribed with the [[Ge'ez script]].

The 1994 Ethiopian census indicates that there were 21,757 Harari speakers. About 20,000 of these individuals were concentrated outside Harar, in Ethiopia's capital [[Addis Ababa]].&lt;ref name="Ethnhar"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=har Ethnologue - Harari language]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Harari people are bilingual in [[Amharic]] and [[Oromo language|Oromo]], both of which are also Afro-Asiatic languages. According to the 1994 Ethiopian census, about 2,351 are monolingual, speaking only Harari.&lt;ref name="Ethnhar"/&gt;

==Religion==
Virtually all Harari are [[Muslim]]. The earliest ''kabir'' or Islamic teacher in the community was Aw Sofi Yahya. He arrived in Harar in 1216 as part of Abadir's retinue. Yahya subsequently established the area's first ''[[Quran|Qur'an]] gey'' or [[madrasa]] around {{convert|10|km}} to the south of the city center.&lt;ref&gt;Siegbert Uhlig, Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N, Volume 3, (Otto Harrassowitz Verlag: 2007), pp.111 &amp; 319&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diaspora==
Hararis comprise under 10% within their own city, due to [[ethnic cleansing]] by the [[Haile Selassie]] regime. Thousands of Hararis were forced to leave Harar in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wehib|first1=Ahmed|title=History of Harar and Harari|date=October 2015|publisher=Harari people regional state, culture, heritage and tourism bureau|page=141|url=https://www.everythingharar.com/files/History_of_Harar_and_Harari-HNL.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harari people moved throughout Ethiopia, mainly to Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, establishing families and businesses. The Harari people have also spread throughout North America, mainly to [[Washington D.C.]], [[Atlanta]], [[Toronto]], [[Dallas]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. Furthermore, a minority of the Harari people live in Europe in countries such as [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Great Britain]]. In [[Melbourne]] [[Australia]], Harari communities such as Sây Harari Afocha are active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Say Harari|url=http://saayharari.com/pages/home.asp|website=Australia Say Harari|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancestor figure with skull, Papua New Guinea, Middle Sepik, Iatmul people, wood, skull, shells and human hair, HAA.jpg|thumb|Ancestor Iatmul figure with skull]]
The '''Iatmul''' are a large ethnic group of about 10,000 people inhabiting some two-dozen politically autonomous villages along the middle [[Sepik River]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. The communities are roughly grouped according to dialect of the [[Iatmül language]] as well as sociocultural affinities. The Iatmul are best known for their art, men's houses, male initiation, elaborate totemic systems, and a famous ritual called ''naven'', first studied by [[Gregory Bateson]] in the 1930s. More recently, the Iatmul are known as a location for tourists and adventure travelers, and a prominent role in the 1988 documentary film ''[[Cannibal Tours]]''.

== History ==
In Iatmul legend, the original condition of the world was a primal sea.  A wind stirred waves, and land surfaced.  A large pit opened, and out emerged the first generation of ancestral spirits and culture-heroes.  The ancestors then embarked on a series of mythic-historic migrations.  Where they trod, land appeared.  Along these routes, the ancestors created the world through naming.  Literally, they named all the features of the world into existence—trees, mountains, stars, winds, rains, tributaries, villages, actions, virtually everything in the world.  These names are called totemic names.  They are claimed by specific patrilineal groups (clans, lineages, and branches).  Totemic names are magical, and form the basis for the religious system.

According to the Iatmul, the primal pit is located near the Sawos-speaking village of Gaikarobi.  After emerging from the pit, most ancestors travelled to the village of Shotmeri.  From there, they dispersed throughout the region, eventually arriving in each village inhabited today.

Each Iatmul community consists of clans, lineages, and "branches." Membership into a group is conferred at birth through the father, what anthropologists call patrilineal descent.  Every village has its own cluster of groups; no two villages consists of the exact same clans and lineages.  Each group tells its own ancestral history of migrations through the region.  These tales are encoded in long chains of complex polysyllabic names called ''tsagi'' that are known only to ritual specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, Gregory, 1958, ''Naven: A Survey of the Problems Suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe Drawn From Three Points of View'', Revised edition, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (Orig. 1936); Stanek, Milan, 1983. ''Sozialordnung und Mythik in Palimbei'', Basel: Museum of Ethnology; Wassmann, Jurg, 1991, ''Song to the Flying Fox: The Public and Esoteric Knowledge of the Important Men of Kandingei about Totemic Songs, Names, and Knotted Chords (Middle Sepik, Papua New Guinea)'', Boroko, Papua New Guinea: National Research Institute; Silverman, Eric K., 2001, ''Masculinity, Motherhood, and Mockery: Psychoanalyzing Culture and the Iatmul Naven Rite in New Guinea'', Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press&lt;/ref&gt;  When ''tsagi'' are chanted during rituals, the names evokes ancestral migrations and different places and features of the landscape created by the group's mythic ancestors during their long-ago travels.

== The name "Iatmul"==
The word "Iatmul" was coined by Gregory Bateson during his initial period of anthropological research among the language group in the late 1920s.  In his 1932 article in the journal ''Oceania'', Bateson wrote that he "adopted the name Iatmul as a general term for the people.  But I doubt whether I am right in so doing."&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, Gregory. Social Structure of the Iatmul People of the Sepik River.  ''Oceania'' 2 (3) 1932:245-91. The reference is to fn 2, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mindimbit village, he reported, local people referred to the entire linguistic group with the compound phrase ''Iatmul-Iambonai''.  The word ''Iambon'' (pronounced Yambon) referred then, and still does, to the upper-most Iatmul-speaking village along the river.  ''Iatmul'' referred only to a single, small clan.  The use of the word Iatmul, then, to signify the entire group, was Bateson's convention, and it thereafter gained anthropological and wider currency.  However, the term is rarely used by Iatmul speakers.  In fact, Iatmul speakers rarely have reason to refer to the entire language group.  The Iatmul are not a centralized tribe.  They never act politically, socially, or economically as a single unit.  Villages are autonomous.  People tend to self-identify not as Iatmul or, as they sometimes say, Iatmoi, but in terms of their clan, lineage, village, or sometimes just the colonial-era regional term, [[Sepik]].

'''Jim Denevan''' (born 1961) is an American [[chef]] and [[artist]] who creates temporary [[land art]]. He is also the founder of ''Outstanding in the Field'', a traveling farm dinner series.

== Biography ==

The passion for sand drawing (and land art) came to Jim Denevan when surfing. He realized how the beaches were empty canvas, and felt the appeal the fill the void.&lt;ref name="kqed 4472"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814112829/http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=4472|title=Jim Denevan|website=Kqed.org|date=May 2005|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 2010, Denevan was commissioned by ''[[The Anthropologist]]'' to create a large scale drawing on [[Lake Baikal]]. The drawing is the world's largest single artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6824326/Sand-drawing-the-worlds-largest-single-artwork.html|title=Sand drawing the world's largest single artwork|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2009-12-16|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/35392/anthropologie-sponsors-the-worlds-largest-artwork/ Artinfo Sept. 4 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary of the journey and artwork called ''Art Hard'' was released in 2011. The short version of the film premiered at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]] and was also accepted at the Carmel Art and Film Festival, DocNYC Film Festival, Milwaukee Short Film Festival and ION International Film Festival.

== Work ==
=== Land art ===
Jim Denevan works with natural materials to create massive scale [[drawings]] in sand, ice, and soil. His sculptures are not placed in the landscape, rather, the landscape is the means of their creation. His process goes beyond drawing and implies a spiritual land-finding process.&lt;ref name="kqed 4472"/&gt;

Jim Denevan uses a stick and a rake to draw on sand. His creations usually last a few hours before being washed away by the tides. Aerial [[photography]] or [[video]] is needed to comprehend the final work.&lt;ref name="kqed 4472"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">'''Khamis El Sakara''' is a Lebanese holiday. The name is from [[Lebanese Arabic]]. It is celebrated on the last Thursday before the first day of [[Lent]], when Lebanese Catholics gather and indulge in [[alcoholic beverage]]s.

This is an old tradition where Christians gather to finish all their meat and dairy before the 40 days of fasting.

Wine was the traditional alcoholic beverage and people were happy to gather and drink a lot of wine.

It is not a religious holiday, is rooted in the customs and traditions of the old Christians who gathered from Thursday to finish all their meat and meat for 4 days. The word was not found in the Arabic lexicon; some try to link it to the remembrance of the dead, but the church dedicated a full week to remember the dead before the fast began. There is no heavenly religion Rather, they are habits that are inherited. [EMH]

انه خميس السكارى وليس خميس الذكارى ؛ نعم خميس السكارى وهو ليس بعيد ديني انما هو منبثق من عادات وتقاليد لدى المسيحين القدامى الذين كانوا يجتمعون من نهار الخميس لينهوا كل ما لديهم من مونة من البان واجبان ولحوم طوال ٤ ايام لعدم وجود برادات لحفظ اللحوم والاكل حينها ؛ وكان النبيذ هو المشروب الروحي الاول وكان البعض من فرط فرحتهم بلقاء العائلة وبساطة العيش يفرطون بشرب النبيذ من هنا اتت التسمية؛ كلمة الذكارى غير موجودة في المعجم العربي ؛ويحاول البعض ربطها بعيد تذكار الموتى الا ان الكنيسة خصصت اسبوع كامل لتذكار الموتى قبل بدء الصوم.ولا توجد اي ديانة سماوية تحبذ السكر بل هي عادات متوارثة فلا داعي من الخجل في التسمية الصحيحة،.

A {{nihongo||キャリアウーマン|'''kyariaūman'''}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for a [[career woman]]. The term refers to the type of [[Japanese woman]], married or not, that pursues a career to make a living and for personal advancement rather than being a [[housewife]] without occupation outside the home. The term came into use when women were [[gender role|expected]] to marry and become housewives after a short period working as an "[[office lady]]."

The term is used in [[Japan]] to describe the counterpart to the Japanese [[salaryman]] (サラリーマン); a career woman in Japan also works for a salary, and seeks to supplement their family's income through work or to remain independent by seeking an independent career.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Early history ===

In the early history of Japan, the status of women were higher as they were thought to have the special ability to communicate with spiritual or divine beings known as ''kami''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The Japanese sun deity, [[Amaterasu]], was female and reflects the sacred role of women in traditional Japanese [[matriarchal]] society. The social status of women began to decline in the beginning of the [[Muromachi period]] (1336).  Following the Muromachi age and well into the late 1800s, women still received equal treatment compared to men in many areas.  They were granted freedom of marriage, love, and equal treatment in regards to work, as they worked under much the same conditions as men.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of the elite classes were bound by a newly reformed version of [[Shinto]], with heavy influences of [[Confucianism]].  Under the Confucian ethic of "[[Three Obediences and Four Virtues|three obediences]]" women were expected to show subservience to their fathers as girls, to their husbands as wives, and to their children in old age.  This began the traditional Japanese image of the "[[Good Wife, Wise Mother]]" in which women were supposed to remain as housewives after marriage, caring for the household, cooking, sewing, and being subservient to their husbands. This, however, only proved a problem for women in the working world during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era (1868–1912).  Despite class distinctions being abolished, Confucian ethics had penetrated into the culture, robbing women of most of their equal status.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Women on farmlands still maintained some level of freedom with work, tending the fields with their husbands and children. Throughout the modernization of Japan, women were denied many of their rights, including the right to work in jobs filled primarily by men, to be paid comparably, and to work in a system that rewarded talent over seniority and sex.

=== Feminism in Japan ===

[[File:Hiratsuka Raicho, 1886-1971.jpg|right|thumb|[[Raicho Hiratsuka]], the founder of the ''[[Bluestocking (magazine)|Seitō]]'' (Bluestocking) publication.]]

During the Meiji era, Haru Hiratsuka took up the pen name [[Raicho Hiratsuka]] and founded the first all-women literary magazine called ''[[Bluestocking (journal)|Seitō]]'', with a number of other like minded contributors.  Seitō was published in 1911 with 134 pages at the start and only 1,000 copies were printed, but the launch of the magazine began the feminist movement in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hiratsuka herself stated in her first essay, "In the beginning, woman was truly the sun.  An authentic person.  Now she is the moon, a wan and sickly moon, dependent on another, reflecting another's brilliance."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Indicating that women had fallen from their position of power as representations of the divine and were made subservient, reflecting the grandeur of others, becoming practically invisible on their own.

In the era of Westernization, more women were becoming educated and began to demand for their legal rights. Female leaders began to emerge in various positions in limit scale. The declining workforce in the aftermath of the First World War encouraged women to march for their equal rights. Though ''Seitō'' remained active only through 1915, Hiratsuka became a powerful figure to women everywhere in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

One of her most important reforms, in 1919, was the petition to revise Article 5 of the police security regulations put into law in the year 1900.  This severely limited the ability for women to attend political meetings or gather political information, which, as Hiratsuka noted, put working women at a disadvantage, because being politically knowledgeable was a partial necessity to have any hope of employment in the male dominated work force (men).&lt;ref&gt;

=== Second World War ===

During the [[Second World War]], there were major shortage of domestic workforce as majority of the men were drafted to join the military. Women, who had been primarily relegated to office work or more likely, bound to the home, began to seek employment to supplement their husband's military incomes.  This led to a small expansion of their capabilities.  The influx of working women into the manufacturing industry to aid the war effort proved invaluable to the [[Japanese economy]].&lt;ref&gt;

Following [[World War II]], men returned home to start work again, but women were reluctant to return to being housewives.  During this postwar state, Japan was in a hurry to gain economic strength to match the west and women were a vital part of the labor force.  Though their roles were still limited, many favoring secretarial work as office ladies, women could work in retail, typically if their family owned stores, they could work as teachers, or in the manufacturing industry.  Japanese women did manage to make a small stride forward in 1947, with the passing of the Japanese Labor Standards Law.  With this in place, working women were given special treatment, restricting their ability to work overtime, on dangerous jobs, on night jobs, and allowing leave during menstruation periods.  Though harmful for women seeking equal footing with men in the job world, it protected the majority of early career women who intended to marry.&lt;ref name="Iwao 1993 176"&gt;{{Cite book

When the recession hit in the mid-70's, the government began to support women workers as a way to bolster the economy.  This began the famous {{Anchor|M-Curve}}'''M-Curve''', which was a graph of the working age of women.  Before marriage and after their children were raised proved to be the times women sought out employment, with a dip in between the two for child rearing.  This roughly formed an '''M''' when charted graphically and the M-curve became the primary reference for working ages of Japanese women to this day.  Despite the apparent support of Japanese women's new found independence, part-time pay for Japanese women was only 61% of a man's wages, gradually worsening as the 70's drew on.&lt;ref&gt;

By the early 80's 45.8% of women aged fifteen and above were in the labor force, the women population of Japan comprising roughly 37.4% of the entire work force.  During this time, unmarried women did not make up the majority of the Japanese work force.  Women age 36 and above accounted for a much larger percentage.  Women who were home bound during this period also used [[piecework]] at home as a way of supplementing the family's income.  Though the pay for this was incredibly poor, accounting for only a bare bones 25,000 yen per month.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent times==
By the year 2000, 40.7% of the total Japanese work force were female workers, with 56.9% of those women being married, indicating the path of career woman was not just open to the single women of Japan. By the end of the 1990s, women were concentrated in light manufacturing work, such as food production, as well as tertiary industries, like retail business, restaurants, and financing companies. In Japan, the idea of a part-time worker is someone who works for a set period, with no bonuses or fringe benefits. Many employers used part-time women workers as supplementary labor with no chance of advancement and unstable [[job security]].

Despite some legislation passed in 1985 to ensure equality, both [[Equal Employment Opportunity Law (Japan)|the Equal Opportunity Law]], which prohibits discrimination, and the Child-Care Leave Law, which gives parents unpaid leave to tend to children, then return to their old position or a similar one, lacked any real power to drive change. No penalties were issued for companies that ignored this, meaning, only women who take on the same burden as male employees, of working full-time, with no breaks for pregnancy or child rearing, are able to have any hope of advancement. Boards of directors, public servants, and judiciary branches of work are typically closed to any career woman not willing to work full-time and overtime regularly. The largest part of the labor force are not the full-time career women, but housewives who work part-time, supplementing the household budget. In fact, the government discourages housewives from making too much money, because if housewives make a certain amount, they lose their husband's dependent allowance.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

This limits the jobs women can do while married. In many instances of the Japanese work force, women who wish to receive equal pay and chances at promotion are expected to act like their salaryman counterparts. This is indicative of one of the problems women face when seeking employment in Japan. While equal in part, they still face discrimination. Many businesses lack the flexibility to offer work which fits the irregular schedules of housewives. There have been some strides forward however. The equal employment legislation of the 1980s did prohibit discrimination in the training, benefits, retirement, and dismissal, however, not in recruitment, hiring, or promotion.&lt;ref&gt;

===Lost Decades===
Since 1991, Japan has undergone a protracted recession known popularly as the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decades]]. After the real estate boom from 1986 to 1991, also known as the [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble economy]], where a strong economy resulted in strong demand for and low unemployment, the Lost Decades resulted in drastic cutbacks among Japanese employers, causing a large increase in unemployment. Despite signs of recovery in the mid-2000s, the [[Great Recession|2008 global economic recession]] has protracted these issues. Among this macroeconomic situation, large changes have been occurring within the Japanese economy that has changed the role of the working woman in Japan. Radical changes in government policies and focus has resulted in increased social care and the creation of dual-sector employment, which have affected female employment and the working housewife.&lt;ref name="Fukuda gen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fukuda|first=Setsuya|title=The Changing Role of Women's Earnings in Marriage Formation in Japan|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=March 2013|volume=646|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0002716212464472}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peng gen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peng|first=Ito|title=Social and political economy of care in Japan and South Korea|journal=International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy|year=2012|volume=32|issue=11|doi=10.1108/01443331211280683}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 February 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Challenges to the dominant male breadwinner model has led to changing social perspectives on the traditional role of the wife in providing familial care, although discrimination and stereotypes remain rampant.&lt;ref name="Yuasa Gen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuasa|first=Masae|title=Japanese Women in Management: Getting Closer to ‘Realities’ in Japan|journal=Asia Pacific Business Review|date=June 2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=195–211|doi=10.1080/1360238042000291180}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of the double-track personnel management strategy in response to government affirmative action policies has contributed to the lack of women in management and gendered roles in the office.&lt;ref name="Yuasa Gen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuasa|first=Masae|title=Japanese Women in Management: Getting Closer to ‘Realities’ in Japan|journal=Asia Pacific Business Review|date=June 2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=195–211|doi=10.1080/1360238042000291180}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wakisaka Gen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wakisaka|first=Akira|title=Women at Work|year=1997|location=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-35574-9|pages=131–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osawa gen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osawa|first=Machiko|title=Japan’s Changing Economy and Women Workers|journal=The Japanese Economy|year=2005|volume=32|issue=4|pages=96–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government policies===
The Lost Decades forced a radical change in legislation as the government was now dealing with major declines in the economy and the competitiveness of Japan in the world markets. Neoliberal trade liberalization policies resulted in increasing competitive pressures on Japanese companies, forcing many to reduce labor costs. The 1998 and 2003 revision of the Labor Standard Law and the 1999 Worker Dispatching Law allowed for easier dismissal of workers and relaxed regulations regarding hiring practices, along with the aforementioned Equal Opportunity Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peng|first=Ito|title=Social and political economy of care in Japan and South Korea|journal=International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy|year=2012|volume=32|issue=11|page=641|doi=10.1108/01443331211280683}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 February 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

As part-time workers, commonly known as [[freeters]], are far less expensive than the traditional full-time lifelong worker whose wages traditionally increased with age, Japanese companies drastically increased the proportion of part-time workers to full-time workers.&lt;ref name="Osawa gen 105"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osawa|first=Machiko|title=Japan’s Changing Economy and Women Workers|journal=The Japanese Economy|year=2005|volume=32|issue=4|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wakisaka|first=Akira|title=Women at Work|year=1997|location=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-35574-9|pages=131–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among young adult workers, the percentage of full-time employees dropped from 90% in 1988 to 54% for a single, high-school educated female. Females are more significantly affected by development, as males are still able to maintain a higher ratio of full-time employment. The full-time employment rate of high-school educated males was at 78% in 2008 as compared to 75% for university educated females. As part-time workers receive lower wages, less employment protection and little benefits, female workers experience marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fukuda|first=Setsuya|title=The Changing Role of Women's Earnings in Marriage Formation in Japan|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=March 2013|volume=646|issue=1|page=111|doi=10.1177/0002716212464472}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing social perspectives===
{{See|Marriage in Japan}}

As decreases in job security and wages for males have negatively impacted the ability of the sole male-breadwinner family model, there is now increasing pressure for women to work outside the home in a dual-earner family model. The percentage of young women who believed that a man should work outside a home and that women should work inside dropped from 41.6% in 1997 to 27.8% in 2008, while for men the rate went from 40.7% to 34.3% respectively.&lt;ref name="Fukuda 2013 112"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fukuda|first=Setsuya|title=The Changing Role of Women's Earnings in Marriage Formation in Japan|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=March 2013|volume=646|issue=1|page=112|doi=10.1177/0002716212464472}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the proportion of young women who expected to work until retirement rose from 15.3% in 1987 to 24.7% in 2010, while the proportion of men who expected their wives to do so rose from 10.5% to 32.7% in the same time period. The increasing acceptance of young Japanese adults of the dual-earner model has resulted in an increase of dual-earner young households from 32.4% in 2000 to 42.8% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fukuda|first=Setsuya|title=The Changing Role of Women's Earnings in Marriage Formation in Japan|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=March 2013|volume=646|issue=1|page=113|doi=10.1177/0002716212464472}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Women are also delaying or avoiding marriage altogether. The mean age of first marriage rose from 24.2 in 1970 to 28.8 in 2010, while the proportion of women aged 25–29 who have not married increased from 18.1% in 1970 to 60.3% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fukuda|first=Setsuya|title=The Changing Role of Women's Earnings in Marriage Formation in Japan|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=March 2013|volume=646|issue=1|page=109|doi=10.1177/0002716212464472}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The education levels of young women are also drastically increasing, at a rate higher than their male counterparts. 45.2% of women in 2010 progressed to university from high school, a dramatic increase from 15.2% in 1990. These changes in Japanese society have narrowed the wage gap between men and women, as wages of female 25–29 years old have reached 88% of their male counterparts in 2007, as opposed to 76% in 1981. However, a large part of this reduction in the wage gap is due to the stagnation of male wages, which was at the same levels in 2007 as in 1991.&lt;ref name="Fukuda 2013 112"/&gt;

===Employment Patterns===
A key issue that remains is the lack of female representation in management. Of all legislators, senior officials and management, females are found in only 9% of the positions. This disparity has contributed to the larger overall gender wage gap of females earning only 66.5% of male earnings in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuasa|first=Masae|title=Japanese Women in Management: Getting Closer to ‘Realities’ in Japan|journal=Asia Pacific Business Review|date=June 2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=195|doi=10.1080/1360238042000291180}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prevalent social opinions suggest that this disparity is due to the lack of commit of Japanese women to their jobs due to their perspectives regarding marriage, family, and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuasa|first=Masae|title=Japanese Women in Management: Getting Closer to ‘Realities’ in Japan|journal=Asia Pacific Business Review|date=June 2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=196|doi=10.1080/1360238042000291180}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the government had [[Equal Employment Opportunity Law (Japan)|imposed the Equal Opportunity Law]] in 1986, companies responded by creating a ‘double-track management system’ (DPM), where a career track allows for promotions but requires transfers, and a non-career track that does not require transfers but has low chances of promotion. Previously, employers often maintained a core workforce mainly consisting of male employees which was expected to work at head office and be transferred around the world, and a peripheral workforce of female employees working at local branches with restricted career advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wakisaka|first=Akira|title=Women at Work|year=1997|location=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-35574-9|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Uptake by females of the career track is extremely low at less than 4% in all industries. Given the strong internal labor market of Japanese companies which stipulates that senior positions are only given to those in the career track and not from sources external to the company, this has contributed to the low proportion of female managers. This DPM system is also prevalent, especially among larger firms, with 51.2% of firms with more than 5,000 employees using the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuasa|first=Masae|title=Japanese Women in Management: Getting Closer to ‘Realities’ in Japan|journal=Asia Pacific Business Review|date=June 2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=198|doi=10.1080/1360238042000291180}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gendered divisions exist in the workplace and are replicated by both male and female workers. Although both genders may be allocated to the same section, males were often trained and allocated towards management jobs. As a result, female workers often were not in or chose not to be in management jobs due to lack of training, experience, and opportunity. In addition, more than half of surveyed companies indicated that they were attempting to eradicate instances of sexual harassment and discriminatory practices by males towards female workers, indicating an existing environment of a male-dominated workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuasa|first=Masae|title=Japanese Women in Management: Getting Closer to ‘Realities’ in Japan|journal=Asia Pacific Business Review|date=June 2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=203|doi=10.1080/1360238042000291180}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Women friendly"==
In the 21st century, though women still face some degrees of discrimination in the Japanese job market, there have been a number of companies that both foster women's equality and reward them on a talent based system.  New fields, such as banking, [[journalism]], insurance sales, and advertising; companies in the information industry, are very appealing to women, because they reward them based on individual ability.  These companies are also keen to rotate workers out every two or three years, giving women the opportunity to explore a number of different departments without job hopping, fostering trust in the company and versatility in the women workers.&lt;ref name="Iwao 1993 176"/&gt;

Aside from the information industry, several foreign companies have taken an interest in Japan.  The companies provide Japanese women, who have some foreign language proficiency, work in challenging fields with pay comparable to their male counterparts.  Women also have a better chance of promotion to managerial positions in foreign companies and are hired based on their skills, rather than potential abilities that can be mastered through on the job training, as is popular with Japanese firms.&lt;ref name="Iwao 1993 176"/&gt;  These alternatives may often lack the job security that can be found at large Japanese companies, but they reward women based on talent rather than seniority, provide better chances for promotion, and offer a greater challenge to working women.

==Stereotypes==
''Women have a mysterious power, despite not being used to their full capacity, due to their desire of marriage over lifetime employment.  They do, however, often work as message carriers, or in secretarial positions that allow them to act as emotional propagandists for the company, hearing secrets of workers and internal affairs.''&lt;ref&gt;

This stereotype was still prevalent, even in the 1980s.  To many, women were only ephemeral creatures, working briefly before settling down for [[marriage in Japan|marriage]], where their only real use was as window dressings or as a company's emotional propagandists.  In a predominantly patriarchal society, women largely went unnoticed in the workforce, due to unfair stereotypes of their positions.  Ethnographers also noticed this, stating that women have a great well of power, equal or greater to that of Japanese men, in terms of will, bravery, and psychological strength, despite being undervalued as members of the work force.&lt;ref&gt;

===Tea girls===
Sometimes called ''ochakumi'' or tea fetchers, this job revolves around women who are specifically hired or requested to serve tea or coffee to their co-workers and executives, sometimes expected to arrive at the office early to tidy up, similarly to a housewife.  This type of work was rooted in the early 1900s, when the office was a different place to work and women were expected to be supporters of men. This position is not only limited to women, however.  Women in managerial positions can be served by lower ranked men in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;

===Hostess===
While comparable to [[geisha]], these women make livings entertaining business men, often spending large amounts of their work time with them.  Hostesses, however, can choose this path, rather than being sold into it, like a brothel girl from the Meiji era.  This type of work borders on the sex industry, with women being paid to amuse men who eat and drink at night clubs, salons, taverns, etc.  Though the hours are irregular, the pay is very good for women willing to work in this sector, some of whom even aspire to own their own private establishments.  Due to the odd nature of this work, though, this type of employment is usually only sought by divorcees, young unmarried Japanese women, or married women in need of quick cash.&lt;ref&gt;

Hostesses will often play the part of a mother or housewife for male customers, caring for them, inflating their ego, and flirting with them, offering bits of flattery for tips.  Depending on the size of the bar, night club, etc., there may be a large show to relax the customers; or in smaller establishments, the hostess will spend one-on-one time with her clients, gaining social ties while charging her clients for their attention.  Though it can be a good source of quick money for women willing to work odd hours, normally single women with a low education, usually around the high school level, are the primary hostess candidates.  They work late into the nights and sleep during the days, so these women are close to opposites of the salarymen they entertain.&lt;ref&gt;

===Office lady===
{{main|Office lady}}
Often nicknamed ''shokuba no hana'' or "office flower," these women suffered discrimination due to the [[#World War II|M-Curve]].  Office ladies were usually hired right after high school or junior high, with university graduates discouraged from pursuing this type of career.  They were kept around the office for the youth they brought to it, hence the "flower" nickname.  They were charged with routine, menial tasks meant to support the male workers.  This type of career offered very little chance of advancement and was specifically designed so that women would leave for marriage before their thirties.  Women between the ages of twenty-four and twenty-eight would often be advised to settle down as a subtle message to quit, as those years were considered the most suitable for marriage.&lt;ref&gt;

==Hindrances to career women==

===Domestic entrapment===
Japanese women will sometimes be forced to take jobs after marriage to supplement their husband's income, however, some women are unable to work, because of the lack of domestic support at home.  Husbands seldom help with the housework, forcing women to stay home rearing children and taking care of domestic tasks. many believe a good housewife's job is to stay at home and look after the house.  Housewives may allow their husband to help in some small tasks, however, they are worried if they see their husband taking too much time to do domestic chores.  Housewives believe the house is their charge and do not want their husbands accusing them of neglecting their responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

Japanese women overall completed 95% of unpaid housework, while among full-time workers women still completed 60% of the housework, an unparalleled proportion among [[OECD]] countries. In 2000, 84.6% of women and 88.5% of men agreed that women should still be responsible for household jobs although it is good to have employment. In 2004, 67.4% of new mothers left their previous job for their first birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuasa|first=Masae|title=Japanese Women in Management: Getting Closer to ‘Realities’ in Japan|journal=Asia Pacific Business Review|date=June 2005|volume=11|issue=2|pages=201|doi=10.1080/1360238042000291180}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment===
With a rise in feminism, more cases of [[sexual harassment]] are being reported from Japanese women in the workplace and [[Chikan (body contact)|on commutes to work]].  Two types of sexual harassment have gain widespread fame in the workplace and are being addressed.  The first revolves around a woman being fired, or demoted due to a refusal to offer sexual favors to her superior.  This is called retaliatory.  The second revolves around an environment that is denigrating to female workers, including sexual comments, lewd pictures, or inappropriate actions by male co-workers in the workplace.  This is called environmental.  Despite these being addressed, due to ambiguities in the legal framework, these types of harassment can be hard to enforce.  Women are bringing it to the public's attention through attempts to speak out against the injustice, however, many remain silent, fearing they will be fired if they speak out.  This hurts their performance, undermining the idea of equality in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sexual harassment can be a double edged sword in the workplace.  Some women reported that men who are caught sexually harassing female co-workers are laughing stocks.  Based on the Japanese idea of shame, some men, especially in large corporations, avoid sexual harassment at all costs to preserve their position.  Also, the opinions of men can vary greatly from department to department.  Women harassed in one department can meet with no resistance after being transferred.  Men's opinions of women in Japan vary greatly, primarily due to their experiences with women.  Apart from their wives, mothers, and hostesses that salarymen spend time with, men live in separate spheres than women, so many are uneducated in the best ways to act.&lt;ref&gt;

===Financial inequality===
Despite improvements to health, education, and overall employment in  21st century postwar Japan, career women suffer from a large bit of [[gender inequality]].  Japan has the largest wage gap between men and women and the smallest proportion of female managers, females enrolled in [[higher education]], and women who hold parliamentary seats among the other [[industrialized nations]] of the world.  In terms of equal wages, Japan offers women even less than their male counterparts compared to its less developed neighbors.  [[Women in China]], Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam all make a higher percentage of wages than Japanese women.  Japan lags far behind in terms of financial equality, despite other improvements over the years.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce===
Divorce rates have risen in Japan since the 1980s, the spread of [[feminism]] weakening the stigma that is often associated with divorce.  Women in the workplace are now more capable of leading an independent life from their husbands and see divorce as an act of autonomy.  Despite this, some women cannot financially afford divorce and there have been several attempts to suppress divorce rates over the years.  Women without a steady income are unlikely to gain joint ownership of property and cannot acquire loans for a new home.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are also more likely to gain custody of the children, but have a difficult time getting the father to share in the costs of rearing them.  Due to the [[Koseki|family registration system]], it is much harder for divorced women or men to remarry.  In these cases, women may choose to avoid divorce for the sakes of their children, despite it being the better option.  If a woman does not already have a steady income, divorce is seldom a viable option, despite younger women seeing it as the better option.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seniority system===
Following World War II, Japan was left with a shortage of skilled workers and a surplus of unskilled workers.  To try to make the best of this situation, the seniority system was instituted in the Japanese workplace, which still persists today.  The idea of a salaryman comes from this system.  With the seniority system, workers were valued for lifetime contributions to their employers, who offered wage increases and promises of promotion depending on the number of years worked.  Women were not seen as wise investments in this system, due largely in part to the M-curve which showed they primarily worked before marriage, then after their children were grown, taking a large span of time in between for child rearing.  Women were relegated to part-time workers, or temporary workers who could be laid off during economic down turns.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  

Even with the seniority system, women were still vital to the work of many companies.  In Tokyo, to attract more women, a semi-managerial track was adopted to work hand in hand with the seniority system.  This track offered women a chance for advancement based on performance, rather than lifetime employment.  Tests for promotion in this track could be grueling and the positions were limited due to the economic burden of paying a managerial salary.  Many Japanese women had to come to terms with taking on heavier responsibilities as well, working late into the night, sometimes alone.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ichiko Ishihara===
{{main|Ichiko Ishihara}}
Ishihara Ichiko was the first Japanese woman to be appointed to an executive post; holding the position of executive director of [[Takashimaya]] department store.  She was famous for her slogan, "Think like a man, act like a lady, and work like a dog."  Ichiko managed to rise to the top of the department store industry by working extensive overtime hours, while reporting she'd left at the designated quitting time, so the company would not have to pay her overtime.  In this manner, she was able to prove her worth to the company without being an economic drain on them.  She used her female perspective to boost sales in kitchenware departments; while initiating bold new ideas and change along the way.&lt;ref&gt;

Ichiko is one of the most prominent career women, working as hard, or harder, than the typical salaryman, while using her skills over seniority to advance.  She was able to go far in the department store business because in the 1980s, it was realized that even if housewives didn't work, they were largely in charge of the family budget and marketing to them would be wiser than the "For men only" idea of business.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Using a feminine perspective to appeal to female clients, while putting in the effort of working massive hours of unpaid overtime, Ichiko was able to prosper from her skill in a system based on seniority that frequently discriminated against women.  While this path of career woman is much more arduous than the part-time or temp work that many women seek and offers little real promise of reward, it is a testament to the power of a career woman, to beat the system.

===Toyoko Nakanishi===
{{main|Toyoko Nakanishi}}
Owner and manager of the Shokado women's bookstore in [[Osaka]], Toyoko has been a very outspoken feminist.  Toyoko is the sole owner and only worker in the bookstore, but her store has become a hub of feminist activity.  In the 1980s, Toyoko and another group of feminists took the time to translate the text "[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]" into Japanese.  She is a different breed of career woman, who is both active in the world of women's rights, but also manages to run a private business on her own, though she attributes much of her success to the feminists who frequent her store.  She keeps Japanese feminist texts perpetually in stock for their convenience.  To her knowledge, Toyoko's store is the only "women's" book store in Japan.  Instead of working up the corporate ladder, Toyoko managed to strike a chord with the women of Japan and succeed as an entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;

===Rumiko Takahashi===

Rumiko Takahashi is among the wealthiest celebrity Japanese [[Mangaka|manga artists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/article.php?id=6753 | title=Japanese Top Tax Payers | accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She began creating [[manga]] in 1978, her greatest works finding their home in the ''[[Shōnen Sunday]]'' magazine, which remains one of the most popular distributors of manga in the country.  Takahashi worked with clockwork regularity in getting her manga out, garnering numerous fans, several deals for overseas publications, and contracts for many of her most popular works to be made into [[anime]], including ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'', ''[[Ranma 1/2]]'', and ''[[Inuyasha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/main.html | title=Profile on Rumiko Takahashi | accessdate = 2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She worked as hard as many career women, however, instead of choosing to embark in the difficult and often discriminatory corporate world, Takahashi chose a different kind of work and to this day remains one of the wealthiest women in Japan.

'''Lehar''' or '''Laalaa''' (in their language) is one of the [[Cangin languages]] spoken in [[Senegal]] in the Laa (or Lehar) region, north of [[Thies]] as well as the [[Tambacounda]] area. The speakers (the [[Serer-Laalaa]]) are ethnically [[Serer people|Serers]], however just like the [[Ndut language|Ndut]], [[Palor language|Palor]], [[Saafi language|Saafi]] and [[Noon language|Noon]] languages, they are closely related to each other than to the [[Serer language|Serer-Sine language]].  The Lehar language which is closer to Noon, is part of the [[Niger–Congo]] family. The number of speakers based on 2002 figures were 10,925.

'''Latvian Wikipedia Marathon''' ({{lang-lv|Latvijas Vikipēdijas maratons}}) was a project that brought together the Latvian Wikipedia community with several private partners in joint effort with the aim of expanding the [[Latvian Wikipedia]] to activate the usability of the [[Latvian language]] in the learning process, cognition and research work. The marathon opened on 11 March 2015. The project aimed to expand the Latvian Wikipedia to 100&amp;nbsp;thousand articles by the centenary of Latvian independence (18 November 2018).

The marathon was an initiative of [[Norvik Banka]], and partners - the [[University of Latvia]], the [[Latvian State Language Center|State Language Centre]], [[Latvian Wikipedia]] editors, [[Latvijas Radio 5|Radio 5]], the digital language services company [[Tilde (company)|Tilde]], information campaign supported by [[Delfi (web portal)|Delfi.lv]], the best prize for writers provided by [[Samsung]]. In March 2015 Latvian Wikipedia contained around 59&amp;nbsp;thousand articles. For comparison, the [[Lithuanian Wikipedia]] has about 170&amp;nbsp;thousand and the [[Estonian Wikipedia]] 131&amp;nbsp;thousand.

== Campaign ==
Within the period from March to August 2015 an organized campaign took place calling on broader Latvian society to engage in the expansion of Wikipedia. The campaign explained the importance of Wikipedia, as well as providing information on Wikipedia article creation. The Marathon campaign was promoted on social networks, as well as through physical advertising. A series of YouTube videos were distributed which featured the following people: biathlete [[Andrejs Rastorgujevs]]; University of Latvia Rector [[Mārcis Auziņš]]; writer [[Inga Žolude]]; [[draugiem.lv]] spokesman [[Jānis Palkavnieks]]; musician [[Jānis Stībelis]]; Wikipedia activist Edgars Lecis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piedalies Latvijas Vikipēdijas maratonā 2015!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DmtJAilkrw|website=YouTube|author=Norvik Banka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
A jury jointly formed by the marathon partners will evaluate the articles according to several criteria, and the end of the campaign, four authors will receive prizes. Articles are judged in the following categories:
* Best Quality article with the greatest intellectual contribution (one or a few especially designed articles)
* Most valuable contribution (a combination of quantity and quality)
* Most-Read article (author, whose articles or one article is particularly read)
* Internet sympathies prize

=== Thematic partner weeks ===
The campaign also had thematic partner weeks, within which the best article on each topic would receive a prize from the partner.

'''Lois Elsa Hole''', [[Order of Canada|CM]], [[Alberta Order of Excellence|AOE]]&lt;ref name="legislature"&gt;[https://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/lt-gov/hole.htm Legislature of Alberta website]&lt;/ref&gt; (née '''Veregin'''; 30 January 1929 – 6 January 2005) was a Canadian politician, [[businesswoman]], [[academician]], professional gardener and best-selling author. She was the [[List of lieutenant governors of Alberta|15th]] [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta]] from 10 February 2000 until her death. She was known as the "Queen of Hugs"&lt;ref name="RAUSI"&gt;[http://www.rausi.ca/Newsletters/RAUSI%20NL%2005%20Mar_Apr.pdf RAUSI (Royal Alberta United Services Institute)]&lt;/ref&gt; for breaking with protocol and hugging almost everyone she met, including journalists, diplomats and other politicians.&lt;ref name="forposterityssake.ca"&gt;[http://www.forposterityssake.ca/Obituary/CC/2005/CC12Jan2005.htm Obituary at the For Posterity's Sake website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208060125/http://www.forposterityssake.ca/Obituary/CC/2005/CC12Jan2005.htm |date=8 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Lois Elsa Veregin was born in [[Buchanan, Saskatchewan]], to Michael M. Veregin and Elsa Viktoria Norsten in 1929, not 1933, as was later misreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Perry|Powell|2006|p=653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family moved to [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]] in 1948, where she completed her education at [[Strathcona Composite High School]].&lt;ref name="forposterityssake.ca"/&gt;

==Family==
In 1950, she met Ted Hole, a young University of Alberta agriculture student. Several years later they married and moved to a {{convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm near [[St. Albert, Alberta]]. Lois and Ted Hole ran a successful market garden business from their farm which they, along with their sons Bill and Jim, incorporated as '''Hole's Greenhouses &amp; Gardens Ltd.''' in 1979.
&lt;ref name="legislature"/&gt; It remained one of Western Canada's largest retail greenhouse stores until it closed in early 2011 when the Hole family moved the operation to their new site on the edge of Lois Hole Centennial Provincial Park, and opened the Enjoy Centre. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Writings==
In 1993 Lois Hole wrote her first book, ''Vegetable Favourites'', and went on to write five more in the "Favourites" series. There are currently more than 1,000,000 copies of the various books in this series in print. The series won the Educational Media Award from the Professional Plant Growers Association in 1996. In 1998, Hole's Greenhouse began publishing their own books starting with Hole's autobiographical ''I'll Never Marry a Farmer''. She also wrote several books with her son, Jim. Hole's Greenhouse has continued to publish gardening books along with a successful annual magazine, ''Lois' Spring Gardening''.

==Affiliations/Awards==
She was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1999 and a Dame of Justice of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem]] in 2000. In 1995, she was named Edmonton Business and Professional Woman of the Year and St. Albert's Citizen of the Year. In 2003 she was awarded the [[Gandhi, King, Ikeda Award|Gandhi, King, Ikeda Humanitarian Award]]. She was made an "Honorary Patricia" by the 1st Battalion [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].

==Ted and Lois Hole's deaths==
During his wife's term in office, Ted Hole died of cancer in April 2003. Lois Hole had been diagnosed with abdominal cancer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/edmonton/edmontonjournal/features/agreport2005/story.html?id=46240706-01c1-442d-ac2e-62de274f98a3 ''Edmonton Journal'' coverage of Lois Hole's cancer diagnosis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121055735/http://www.canada.com/edmonton/edmontonjournal/features/agreport2005/story.html?id=46240706-01c1-442d-ac2e-62de274f98a3 |date=21 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002, making a public announcement the following year when she began treatment in early 2003. Her health improved, temporarily, but by late 2004, her case was terminal. Her illness prevented her from making several scheduled public appearances. She died in office at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton on 6 January 2005, aged 75.

==Age==
Most sources cited 1933 as Lois Hole's year of birth based on her reported age at death. However, the [[Edmonton Journal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.canada.com/edmonton/edmontonjournal/features/agreport2005/story.html?id=46240706-01c1-442d-ac2e-62de274f98a3 ''Edmonton Journal'' archive]&lt;/ref&gt; the Royal Alberta United Services Institute's newsletter&lt;ref name="RAUSI"/&gt; and the Legislature of [[Alberta]]&lt;ref name="legislature"/&gt; all indicate that she was born in 1929. The Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta confirmed that Hole was born on 30 January 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Date of birth confirmed as 30 January 1929 via email from Mary Hunt, Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, Room 212 Legislature Building, Edmonton, Alberta T5K 2B6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Alberta Library Trustees Association (ALTA) established the Lois Hole Award in 2001. In November 2004, two months before Lois Hole's death, the Capital Health Authority in Edmonton announced that a new wing of the [[Royal Alexandra Hospital (Edmonton)|Royal Alexandra Hospital]] would be named the Lois Hole Hospital for Women. It opened 13 April 2010 and consolidated the women's health programs and services based at the Royal Alexandra Hospital into one building.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

On 19 April 2005 the Lois Hole Centennial Provincial Park was established, becoming the 69th provincial park in Alberta. The park contains the former Big Lake Natural Area and an additional 302 hectares of Crown land, for a total of 1421 hectares. The lake makes up around 59 per cent of the park's total area.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In 2008 the [[Edmonton Public Library]] opened the Lois Hole Library in [[Callingwood North, Edmonton|Callingwood North]]. It features a sculpture of Lois Hole by [[Danek Mozdzenski]] and a reading garden. In 2009, the City of St. Albert declared 14 May to be Lois Hole Day. A bronze statue designed by [[Barbara Paterson]] called ''A Legacy of Love and Learning'' was unveiled at city hall on this day.

The two wild roses refer to Their Honours' two sons, and the book represents Her Honour's love of learning and long involvement with education. The shield surmounts the Badge of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, and is surrounded by the motto ribbon of the Order of Canada.

The lion refers to Alberta and Saskatchewan, where it appears in the provincial coats of arms; to England, His Honour's ancestral homeland; and to the lion of the arms of the Scottish family of Buchanan, and being a reference to Her Honour's birthplace in Saskatchewan. The maple leaf coronet symbolizes her service to Canada and as the Queen's representative in Alberta, while the roses, repeating the reference to Her Honour's favourite flower, are shown in Canada's national colours. The book represents both Her Honour's long involvement with education as a school trustee and as Chancellor of the University of Alberta, and the importance she attaches to education. The wheat field represents both Saskatchewan and the central part played by this grain in the making of bread, a staple with a great symbolic significance to the Doukhoubors, and hence a strong reference to Her Honour's father. The green grass represents an important element of landscaping and gardening. The German Shepherds were chosen by Her Honour as they are a strong intelligent breed for which Her Honour indicated a preference. Their collars combine the official provincial flowers of Alberta and Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=47&amp;ProjectElementID=149| last=Canadian Heraldic Authority| title=The Public Register of Arms, Flags, and Badges of Canada&gt; Lois Elsa Hole|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lord’s waste''' was common land where all members of the community had right of passage.

:Part of the [[Demesne|demesne land]] of the manor which being uncultivated was termed the Lord’s Waste and served for public roads and for common pasture to the lord and his tenants.&lt;ref&gt;''Black’s Law Dictionary'', 6th ed., 1990, quoted at http://www.henleynews.co.uk/history/LordsWaste.pdf. See also TheFreeDictionary definition of Manor: http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Manor&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lord’s waste settlements==
In many settlements during the [[Early modern Europe|early modern]] period, illegal building was carried out on lord’s waste land by squatters who would then plead their case to remain with local support. An example of a lord’s waste settlement, where the main centres grew up in this way, is the village of [[Bredfield]] in [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;See Bredfield Parish Plan 2006, p.9: {{cite web |url=http://www.bredfield.org.uk/material/Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209130638/http://www.bredfield.org.uk/material/Report.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord’s waste continues to be a source of rights and responsibilities issues in places such as [[Henley-in-Arden]], [[Warwickshire]].&lt;ref&gt;See article at Henley News On-Line: http://www.henleynews.co.uk/history/LordsWaste.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lughnasadh''' or '''Lughnasa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|n|@|s|@}} {{respell|LOO|nə-sə}}) is a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] festival marking the beginning of the [[harvest]] season. Historically, it was widely observed throughout [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. In Modern Irish it is called {{lang|ga|Lúnasa}}, in {{lang-gd|Lùnastal}}, and in {{lang-gv|Luanistyn}}. Traditionally it is held on 1 August, or about halfway between the [[summer solstice]] and [[september equinox|autumn equinox]]. However, in recent centuries some of the celebrations shifted to the Sundays nearest this date. Lughnasadh is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals, along with [[Samhain]], [[Imbolc]] and [[Beltane]]. It corresponds to other European [[harvest festival]]s such as the Welsh {{lang|cy|Gŵyl Awst}} and the English [[Lammas]].

Lughnasadh is mentioned in some of the [[Early Irish literature|earliest Irish literature]] and has [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] origins. The festival itself is named after the god [[Lugh]]. It involved great gatherings that included religious ceremonies, ritual athletic contests (most notably the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]]), feasting, [[matchmaking]] and trading. There were also visits to [[holy well]]s. According to folklorist [[Máire MacNeill]], evidence shows that the religious rites included an offering of the '[[First Fruits|first fruits]]', a feast of the new food and of [[bilberry|bilberries]], the [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] of [[sacred bull|a bull]] and a ritual dance-play in which Lugh seizes the harvest for mankind and defeats the powers of blight. Much of the activities would have taken place on top of hills and mountains.

Lughnasadh customs persisted widely until the 20th century, with the event being variously named 'Garland Sunday', 'Bilberry Sunday', 'Mountain Sunday' and '[[Crom Dubh]] Sunday'. The custom of climbing hills and mountains at Lughnasadh has survived in some areas, although it has been re-cast as a Christian pilgrimage. The best known is the '[[Reek Sunday]]' pilgrimage to the top of [[Croagh Patrick]] on the last Sunday in July. A number of [[fair]]s are also believed to be survivals of Lughnasadh, for example the [[Puck Fair]]. Since the late 20th century, [[Celtic Neopaganism|Celtic neopagans]] have observed Lughnasadh, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. In some places, elements of the festival have been revived as a cultural event.

==Name==
In [[Old Irish]] (or Old Gaelic), the name was {{lang|sga|Lugnasad}} (&lt;small&gt;IPA:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-ga|ˈ|l|u|gh|n|@|s|@|d}}). This is a combination of {{lang|sga|Lug}} (the god [[Lugh]]) and {{lang|sga|násad}} (an assembly), which is unstressed when used as a suffix.&lt;ref name="Foclóir_Dineen" /&gt; Later spellings include {{lang|sga|Luᵹ̇nasaḋ}}, {{lang|sga|Lughnasadh}} and {{lang|sga|Lughnasa}}.

In [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] ({{lang|ga|Gaeilge}}), the spelling is {{lang|ga|Lúnasa}} {{IPAc-ga|ˈ|ll|uː|nn|@|s|@}}, which is also the name for the month of August.

[[File:Autel tricephale MuseeStRemi Reims 1131a.jpg|thumb|125px|left|An altar depicting a three-faced god identified as Lugh/Lugus]]
In [[Irish mythology]], the Lughnasadh festival is said to have begun by the god [[Lugh]] (modern spelling: {{lang|ga|Lú}}) as a funeral feast and athletic competition (see [[funeral games]]) in commemoration of his mother or foster-mother [[Tailtiu]].&lt;ref name="monaghan297"&gt;Monaghan, pp.297–299&lt;/ref&gt; She was said to have died of exhaustion after clearing the plains of Ireland for agriculture.&lt;ref name="monaghan297"/&gt; Tailtiu may have been an earth goddess who represented the dying vegetation that fed mankind.&lt;ref name="monaghan436"&gt;Monaghan, pp.436–437&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral games in her honour were called the {{lang|ga|[[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Óenach Tailten]]}} or {{lang|ga|Áenach Tailten}} (modern spelling: {{lang|ga|Aonach Tailteann}}) and were held each Lughnasadh at [[Telltown|Tailtin]] in what is now [[County Meath]]. According to medieval writings, kings attended this ''[[óenach]]'' and a truce was declared for its duration. It was similar to the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] and included ritual athletic and sporting contests, [[horse racing]], music and storytelling, trading, proclaiming laws and settling legal disputes, drawing-up contracts, and [[matchmaking]].&lt;ref name="monaghan297"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kelly459"&gt;Kelly, Fergus.

A 15th century version of the Irish legend ''[[Tochmarc Emire]]'' ("the Wooing of Emer") is one of the earliest documents to record these festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/8-facts-to-know-about-lughnasadh-pagan-harvest-festival_us_579a832ee4b08a8e8b5d6134|title=8 Facts To Know About Lughnasadh, Pagan Harvest Festival|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|date=2016-07-29|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 18th century to the mid 20th century, many accounts of Lughnasadh customs and folklore were recorded. In 1962 ''The Festival of Lughnasa'', a study of Lughnasadh by [[folkloristics|folklorist]] [[Máire MacNeill]], was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/books/new-year-folder-3/the-festival-of-lughnasa/|title=Four Courts Press {{!}} The Festival of Lughnasa|last=http://www.fuel.ie|first=Created by Fuel.ie in Dublin:|website=www.fourcourtspress.ie|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacNeill studied surviving Lughnasadh customs and folklore as well as the earlier accounts and medieval writings about the festival. She concluded that the evidence testified to the existence of an ancient festival around 1 August that involved the following:
[[File:Croagh Patrick - geograph.org.uk - 1773456.jpg|thumb|300px|Pilgrims climbing Croagh Patrick on "Reek Sunday". It is believed that climbing hills and mountains was a big part of the festival since ancient times, and the "Reek Sunday" pilgrimage is likely a continuation of this.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;A solemn [[First Fruits|cutting of the first of the corn]] of which an offering would be made to the deity by bringing it up to a high place and burying it; a meal of the new food and of [[bilberry|bilberries]] of which everyone must partake; a sacrifice of a [[sacred bull]], a feast of its flesh, with some ceremony involving its hide, and its replacement by a young bull; a ritual dance-play perhaps telling of a struggle for a goddess and a ritual fight; an installation of a [carved stone] head on top of the hill and a triumphing over it by an actor impersonating Lugh; another play representing the confinement by Lugh of the monster blight or famine; a three-day celebration presided over by the brilliant young god [Lugh] or his human representative. Finally, a ceremony indicating that the interregnum was over, and the chief god in his right place again.&lt;ref name="macneill426"&gt;MacNeill, Máire. ''The Festival of Lughnasa: A Study of the Survival of the Celtic Festival of the Beginning of Harvest''. Oxford University Press, 1962. p.426&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to MacNeill, the main theme that emerges from the folklore and rituals of Lughnasadh is a struggle for the harvest between two gods. One god – usually called [[Crom Dubh]] – guards the [[grain]] as his treasure. The other god – Lugh – must seize it for mankind.&lt;ref name="macneill416"&gt;MacNeill, Máire. ''The Festival of Lughnasa''. p.416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Gabhann, Seamus. [http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/770/1/Landsmarks.pdf "Landmarks of the people: Meath and Cavan places prominent in Lughnasa mythology and folklore"]. ''Ríocht na Midhe'', 11. Meath Archaeological &amp; Historical Society, 2000. pp.236–237&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, this was portrayed as a struggle over a woman called [[Eithne]], who represents the grain. Lugh also fights and defeats a figure representing blight.&lt;ref name="macneill416"/&gt; MacNeill says that these themes can be seen in earlier Irish mythology, particularly in the tale of Lugh defeating [[Balor]],&lt;ref name="macneill416"/&gt; which seems to represent the overcoming of blight, drought and the scorching summer sun.&lt;ref&gt;Ó hÓgáin, Dáithí. ''Fionn Mac Cumhaill: Images of the Gaelic Hero''. Gill &amp; MacMillan, 1988. p.11&lt;/ref&gt; In surviving folklore, Lugh is usually replaced by [[Saint Patrick]], while Crom Dubh is a pagan chief who owns a [[granary]] or a bull and who opposes Patrick, but is overcome and converted. Crom Dubh is likely the same figure as [[Crom Cruach]] and shares some traits with [[the Dagda]] and [[Donn]].&lt;ref name="macneill416"/&gt; He may be based on an underworld god like [[Hades]] and [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], who kidnaps the grain goddess [[Persephone]] but is forced to let her return to the world above before harvest time.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Franklin &amp; Paul Mason. ''Lammas: Celebrating Fruits of the First Harvest''. Llewellyn Worldwide, 2001. p.238&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the customs described by MacNeill and by medieval writers were being practised into the modern era, though they were either Christianized or shorn of any pagan religious meaning. Many of Ireland's prominent mountains and hills were climbed at Lughnasadh. Some of the treks were eventually re-cast as Christian pilgrimages, the most well-known being [[Reek Sunday]]—the yearly pilgrimage to the top of [[Croagh Patrick]] in late July.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Other hilltop gatherings were secular and attended mostly by the youth. In Ireland, bilberries were gathered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monaghan |first=Patricia |title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2004 |page=45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was eating, drinking, dancing, folk music, games and matchmaking, as well as athletic and sporting contests such as [[Weight throw|weight-throwing]], [[hurling]] and horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, ''The Festival of Lughnasa'', pp.142–143, 150, 180, 182&lt;/ref&gt; At some gatherings, everyone wore flowers while climbing the hill and then buried them at the summit as a sign that summer was ending.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, ''The Festival of Lughnasa'', p.143&lt;/ref&gt;  In other places, the first sheaf of the harvest was buried.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, ''The Festival of Lughnasa'', p.421&lt;/ref&gt; There were also faction fights, whereby two groups of young men [[Bataireacht|fought with sticks]].&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, ''The Festival of Lughnasa'', p.424&lt;/ref&gt; In 18th-century [[Lothian]], rival groups of young men built towers of sods topped with a flag. For days, each group tried to sabotage the other's tower, and at Lughnasadh they met each other in 'battle'.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, ''The Festival of Lughnasa'', pp.369–372&lt;/ref&gt; Bull sacrifices around Lughnasadh time were recorded as late as the 18th century at [[Gaeltacht Cois Fharraige|Cois Fharraige]] in Ireland (where they were offered to Crom Dubh) and at [[Loch Maree]] in Scotland (where they were offered to Saint [[Máel Ruba]]).&lt;ref&gt;MacNeill, ''The Festival of Lughnasa'', pp.407, 410&lt;/ref&gt; Special meals were made with the first produce of the harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Scottish Highlands]], people made a special cake called the {{lang|gd|lunastain}}, which may have originated as an offering to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p.299&lt;/ref&gt;

Another custom that Lughnasadh shared with Imbolc and Beltane was visiting [[holy well]]s. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking [[sunwise]] around the well. They would then leave offerings; typically coins or [[clootie]]s (see [[clootie well]]).&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[bonfire]]s were lit at some of the open-air gatherings in Ireland, they were rare and incidental to the celebrations.&lt;ref name="hutton"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |title=Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |pages=327–330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Lughnasadh has always been reckoned as the first day of August. In recent centuries, however, much of the gatherings and festivities associated with it shifted to the nearest Sundays – either the last Sunday in July or first Sunday in August. It is believed this is because the coming of the harvest was a busy time and the weather could be unpredictable, which meant work days were too important to give up. As Sunday would have been a day of rest anyway, it made sense to hold celebrations then. The festival may also have been affected by the [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|shift to the Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Danaher |first=Kevin |year=1972 |title=The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs |location=Dublin |publisher=Mercier |isbn=1-85635-093-2 |pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Lughnasadh customs==
In Ireland, some of the mountain pilgrimages have survived. By far the most popular is the Reek Sunday pilgrimage at Croagh Patrick, which attracts tens of thousands of pilgrims each year. The Catholic Church in Ireland established the custom of blessing fields at Lughnasadh.

[[File:Puck Fair, Killorglin, Co. Kerry.jpg|thumb|300px|The Puck Fair ''circa'' 1900, showing the wild goat (King Puck) atop his 'throne']]

The [[Puck Fair]] is held each year in early August in the town of [[Killorglin]], [[County Kerry]]. It has been traced as far back as the 16th century but is believed to be a survival of a Lughnasadh festival. At the beginning of the three-day festival, a wild goat is brought into the town and crowned 'king', while a local girl is crowned 'queen'. The festival includes traditional music and dancing, a parade, [[handicraft|arts and crafts]] workshops, a horse and cattle fair, and a market. It draws a great number of tourists each year.

In recent years, other towns in Ireland have begun holding yearly Lughnasa Festivals and Lughnasa Fairs. Like the Puck Fair, these often include traditional music and dancing, arts and crafts workshops, traditional storytelling, and markets. Such festivals have been held in [[Gweedore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://loinneoglunasa.com/ |title=Loinneog Lúnasa |accessdate=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sligo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sligotourism.ie/event/sligo-lunasa-festival/ |title=Sligo Lúnasa Festival |publisher=Sligo Tourism |accessdate=1 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515151101/http://www.sligotourism.ie/event/sligo-lunasa-festival/ |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brandon, County Kerry|Brandon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.irelandview.com/festivals/kerry-feilenalughnasa.php |title=Festival of Lughnasa – Cloghane &amp; Brandon |accessdate=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rathangan, County Kildare|Rathangan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kildare.tv/rathangan-lughnasa-festival/ |title=Rathangan Lughnasa Festival |publisher=Kildare.tv |accessdate=1 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029213454/http://kildare.tv/rathangan-lughnasa-festival/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other places. [[Craggaunowen]], an [[open-air museum]] in [[County Clare]], hosts a yearly Lughnasa Festival at which [[historical reenactment|historical re-enactors]] demonstrate elements of daily life in [[Gaelic Ireland]]. It includes displays of replica clothing, artefacts, weapons and jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shannonheritage.com/Events/AnnualEvents/LughnasaFestival/ |title=Lughnasa Festival at Craggaunowen| publisher=Shannon Heritage |accessdate=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event has been held each year at [[Carrickfergus Castle]] in [[County Antrim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.carrickadvertiser.co.uk/articles/news/34999/lughnasa-fair-returns-to-carrickfergus-castle/ |title=Lughnasa Fair returns to Carrickfergus Castle |work=[[Carrickfergus Advertiser]] |date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907161821/http://www.carrickadvertiser.co.uk/articles/news/34999/lughnasa-fair-returns-to-carrickfergus-castle/ |archivedate=7 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] aired a live television program from Craggaunowen at Lughnasa, called ''Lughnasa Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/programmes/lughnasa.html |title=Lughnasa Live |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] |accessdate=1 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809050409/http://www.rte.ie/tv/programmes/lughnasa.html |archivedate=9 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Irish diaspora]], survivals of the Lughnasadh festivities are often seen by some families still choosing August as the traditional time for family reunions and parties, though due to modern work schedules these events have sometimes been moved to adjacent secular holidays, such as the [[Fourth of July]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danaher"/&gt;

The festival is referenced in [[Brian Friel]]'s play ''[[Dancing at Lughnasa]]'' (1990), which was made into [[Dancing at Lughnasa (film)|a film of the same name]].

===Neopaganism===
Lughnasadh and Lughnasadh-based festivals are held by some [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]], especially [[Celtic Neopaganism|Celtic Neopagans]]. However, their Lughnasadh celebrations can be very different despite the shared name. Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible,&lt;ref name="Gallagher"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Gallagher |first1=Eugene V. |last2=Ashcraft |first2=W. Michael |title=Introduction to new and alternative religions in America |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=[[Westport, Connecticut]] |isbn=0-275-98713-2 |page=178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others base their celebrations on many sources, the Gaelic festival being only one of them.&lt;ref name="Adler1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Adler |first=Margot |year=1979 |title=Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today |location=[[Boston]] |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=0-8070-3237-9 |page=397 }} – Excerpts from Manhattan Pagan Way Beltane ritual script, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McColman1"&gt;{{cite book |last=McColman |first=Carl |year=2003 |title=Complete Idiot's Guide to Celtic Wisdom |publisher=Alpha Press |isbn=0-02-864417-4 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopagans usually celebrate Lughnasadh on 1 August in the Northern Hemisphere and 1 February in the Southern Hemisphere, often beginning their festivities at sunset the evening before.&lt;ref name="SpiralDance"&gt;{{cite book |author=Starhawk |origyear=1979 |year=1989 |title=The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess |publisher=Harper and Row |isbn=0-06-250814-8 |pages=191–2 |edition=Revised }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nevill |last=Drury |editor1-first=Murphy |editor1-last=Pizza |editor2-first=James R |editor2-last=Lewis |title=Handbook of Contemporary Paganism |year=2009 |chapter=The Modern Magical Revival: Esbats and Sabbats |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwzttsI9-NwC&amp;pg=PA63 |pages=63–67 |location=[[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]] |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=9789004163737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia |last=Hume |first=Lynne |year=1997 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |location=Melbourne |isbn=9780522847826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vos |first=Donna |title=Dancing Under an African Moon: Paganism and Wicca in South Africa |year=2002 |pages=79–86 |publisher=Zebra Press |location=[[Cape Town]] |isbn=9781868726530 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bodsworth |first=Roxanne T. |title=Sunwyse: Celebrating the Sacred Wheel of the Year in Australia |year=2003 |publisher=Hihorse Publishing |location=Victoria, Australia |isbn=9780909223038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Neopagans celebrate it at the astronomical midpoint between the summer solstice and autumn equinox (or the full moon nearest this point).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeoastronomy.com/seasons.html |title=Equinoxes, Solstice, Cross Quarters shown as seasonal cusps, worshipped by pagans and later religious holidays |publisher=Archaeoastronomy.com |date= |accessdate=5 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, this is on 7 August in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeoastronomy.com/2017.html |title=2017 Equinox, Solstice &amp; Cross-Quarter Moments |publisher=archaeoastronomy.com |date= |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic Reconstructionist====
[[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionists]] strive to reconstruct the pre-Christian religions of the Celts. Their religious practises are based on research and historical accounts,&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McColman2"&gt;McColman (2003) pp.12, 51&lt;/ref&gt; but may be modified slightly to suit modern life. They avoid [[syncretism]] (i.e. combining practises from different cultures).

Celtic Reconstructionists who follow Gaelic traditions tend to celebrate Lughnasadh at the time of "first fruits", or on the full moon nearest this time. In the [[Northeastern United States]], this is often the time of the [[blueberry]] harvest, while in the [[Pacific Northwest]] the [[blackberries]] are often the festival fruit.&lt;ref name="Danaher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McColman2"/&gt; In Celtic Reconstructionism, Lughnasadh is seen as a time to give thanks to the spirits and deities for the beginning of the harvest season, and to propitiate them with offerings and prayers not to harm the still-ripening crops. The god [[Lugh]] is honoured by many at this time, and gentle rain on the day of the festival is seen as his presence and his bestowing of blessings. Many Celtic Reconstructionists also honour the goddess [[Tailtiu]] at Lughnasadh, and may seek to keep the ''[[Cailleach]]an'' from damaging the crops, much in the way appeals are made to Lugh.&lt;ref name="Danaher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McColman2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonewits"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bonewits |first=Isaac |year=2006 |title=Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism |location=New York |publisher=Kensington Publishing Group |isbn=0-8065-2710-2 |pages=186–7, 128–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2"&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=F. Marian |year=1957 |title=The Silver Bough |volume=Volume 1 |publisher=William MacLellan |location=[[Glasgow]] |isbn=0-85335-161-9 |page=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wicca====
[[Wicca]]ns use the names "Lughnasadh" or "Lammas" for the first of their autumn harvest festivals. It is one of the eight yearly "Sabbats" of their [[Wheel of the Year]], following Midsummer and preceding Mabon. It is seen as one of the two most auspicious times for [[handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]], the other being at Beltane.&lt;ref name="Farrar"&gt;{{cite book |last=Farrar |first=Janet &amp; Stewart |year=198 |title=Eight Sabbats for Witches |publisher=Phoenix Publishing |isbn=0-919345-26-3 |pages=102–3, 106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Wiccans mark the holiday by baking a figure of the "corn god" in bread, and then symbolically sacrificing and eating it.&lt;ref name="SpiralDance"/&gt;

[[File:Photos NewYork1 032.jpg|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] on [[Wall Street]], the world's largest [[stock exchange]] in terms of total market capitalization of its listed companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-exchanges.org/files/file/stats%20and%20charts/July%202010%20WFE%20Market%20Highlights.pdf|title=Market highlights for first half-year 2010|publisher=World Federation of Exchanges|accessdate=May 29, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722235155/http://www.world-exchanges.org/files/file/stats%20and%20charts/July%202010%20WFE%20Market%20Highlights.pdf|archivedate=July 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Market capitalization''' ('''market cap''') is the market value of a [[publicly traded company]]'s [[shares outstanding|outstanding shares]]. Market capitalization is equal to the [[share price]] multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.&lt;ref name="investmcd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Capitalization Definition|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Times Lexicon|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=market-capitalisation|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outstanding [[Share (finance)|stock]] is bought and sold in public markets, capitalization could be used as an [[Proxy (statistics)|indicator]] of public opinion of a company's [[net worth]] and is a determining factor in some forms of [[stock valuation]].

Market capitalization is used by the investment community in ranking the size of companies, as opposed to sales or total asset figures. It is also used in ranking the relative size of [[stock exchange]]s, being a measure of the sum of the market capitalizations of all companies listed on each stock exchange. (See [[List of stock exchanges]].) In performing such rankings, the market capitalizations are calculated at some significant date, such as June 30 or December 31.

The total capitalization of [[stock market]]s or [[macroeconomics|economic regions]] may be compared with other [[economic indicator]]s. The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world was US$51.2 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] in January 2007&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2144839620070321 Global stock values top $50 trln: industry data] ([[Reuters]])&lt;/ref&gt; and rose as high as US$57.5 trillion in May 2008&lt;ref name="world-exchanges.org"&gt;[http://www.world-exchanges.org/WFE/home.asp?menu=395 WFE Report Generator including report for Domestic Market Capitalization 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008033914/http://www.world-exchanges.org/WFE/home.asp?menu=395 |date=October 8, 2008 }} ([[World Federation of Exchanges]])&lt;/ref&gt; before dropping below US$50 trillion in August 2008 and slightly above US$40 trillion in September 2008.&lt;ref name="world-exchanges.org" /&gt; In 2014 and 2015, global market capitalization was US$68 trillion and US$67 trillion, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-exchanges.org/home/index.php/news/world-exchange-news/wfe-full-year-statistics-show-2015-global-equity-trading-volumes-rise-55-as-volatility-boosts-activity WFE Full Year Statistics 2015] ([[World Federation of Exchanges]])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation ==
Market cap is given by the formula &lt;math display="inline"&gt; MC = N \times P &lt;/math&gt;, where ''MC'' is the market capitalization, ''N'' is the number of shares outstanding, and ''P'' is the closing price per share.

For example, if some company has 4 million shares outstanding and the closing price per share is $20, its market cap is then $80 million. If the closing price per share rises to $21, the market cap becomes $84 million. If it drops to $19 per share, the market cap falls to $76 million. This is in contrast to mercantile pricing where purchase price, average price and sale price may differ due to transaction costs.

== Market cap terms ==
&lt;!-- "FTSE KLD 400 Social Index" links here --&gt;
Traditionally, companies were divided into '''large-cap''', '''mid-cap''', and '''small-cap'''.&lt;ref name="investmcd" /&gt; The terms '''mega-cap''' and '''[[microcap stock|micro-cap]]''' have also since come into common use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mega Cap Definition|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/megacap.asp|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro Cap Definition|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microcapstock.asp|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''nano-cap''' is sometimes heard. Different numbers are used by different indexes;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investorwords.com/2969/market_capitalization.html Definition of Market Capitalization]&lt;/ref&gt; there is no official definition of, or full consensus agreement about, the exact cutoff values. The cutoffs may be defined as percentiles rather than in [[real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal dollars]]. The definitions expressed in nominal dollars need to be adjusted over decades due to inflation, population change, and overall market valuation (for example, $1 billion was a large market cap in 1950, but it is not very large now), and market caps are likely to be different country to country.

== Related measures ==
Market cap reflects only the ''equity'' value of a [[company]]. It is important to note that a firm's choice of capital structure has a significant impact on how the total value of a company is allocated between equity and debt. A more comprehensive measure is [[enterprise value]] (EV), which gives effect to outstanding debt, preferred stock, and other factors. For insurance firms, a value called the [[embedded value]] (EV) has been used.

'''National Women's Organization (NOK)''' (Polish: Narodowa Organizacja Kobiet) was a Polish women's organisation. It was founded in 1918 as a branch of the [[National Democracy]] party. It was a Catholic Conservative women's association who encouraged conservative women to participate in society.

There has historically been, and continues to be, several rival '''nationalisms in Canada'''. Canadians have differing cultural and political identifications which often overlap. Loyalty towards Canada is tempered by strong regional and ethnic identities, and an affinity toward a common North American culture shared with the United States.

The largest and most-apparent differences are between [[English Canada|English]] and [[French Canada]], with the federal government recognizing the Québécois as "a nation within a united Canada".&lt;ref name=record&gt;[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2544166&amp;File=0#Int-1798655 Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the provinces, Newfoundlanders also have a strong sense of national identity, having had a period of [[Dominion of Newfoundland|separate nationhood]] before joining the Canadian Confederation. Additionally, there has been a revival of Aboriginal nationalism, identifying with a specific band or tribe or with [[First Nations]] in general.

Also common are [[diaspora nationalism]]s, with nearly every such community represented in Canada. Most Canadians see no conflict in being loyal to Canada while retaining a sense of ethnic identity and connection to the homeland. With an increasingly diverse cultural landscape in the country, some have advocated for [[civic nationalism]] based on shared citizenship and common rights.

== Identifying nationalism ==
There has long been a recognition by scholars that [[English Canada|English]] and [[French Canada]] have divergent views of the nation, often referred to as the [[Two Solitudes (Canadian society)|Two Solitudes]], from the title of a 1945 novel.

The existence of multiple strains of [[nationalism]] within nineteenth century English-speaking Canada was first explored by historian [[Carl Berger (historian)|Carl Berger]] in his 1971 book ''[[The Sense of Power]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=8yPql7tv9ukC }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his article in ''[[The Journal of British Studies]]''.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Problem of "Nationalism" and "Imperialism" in British Settlement Colonies |first=Douglas|last=Cole |journal=Journal of British Studies |volume=10 |issue=2 |date=May 1971 |pages=160–182 |jstor=175353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== First Nations, first nationalism? ===
In the [[historiography of nationalism]] there is significant dispute over whether true nationalism existed in pre-modern societies.  [[Canada's aboriginal peoples]] were generally organized into small societies which anthropologists call [[band societies|bands]], which were sometimes part of a larger grouping called a [[tribe]].  Occasionally several tribes would form a larger group called a [[confederation|confederacy]] (the [[Iroquois]], [[Seven Nations of Canada]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Blackfoot]], and [[Iron Confederacy|Plains Cree-Assiniboine]] were or are confederacies).  None of these resembled nations as understood in Europe in terms of scale or permanence.  Today these groupings are referred to as "[[First Nations]]", representing their historical and modern role as sources of identity for many native people.

=== Settler and refugee nationalism arrive ===
The first Europeans to exhibit nationalism in Canada may have been the [[French diaspora|French settlers]] who inhabited [[New France]].  They showed a great deal of loyalty and community in the face of repeated attacks by British and Iroquois rivals during the [[French and Indian Wars]].  However, by the end of the French regime in North America, ''[[acadiens]]'' and ''[[canadiens]]'' may have already been showing signs of developing identities distinct from France.

The interrelated British ideologies of [[British nationalism|nationalism]], [[British Unionism|unionism]], [[loyalism]], and [[imperialism]] arrived first in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] then [[the Maritimes]], and finally in [[Central Canada]] with British traders who followed the [[British Army]] into these regions as each was successively won from France, ending with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]].  They were reinforced from the 1770s to 1810s by the [[United Empire Loyalists]]: pro-British [[refugees]] fleeing the [[American Revolution]].

=== Rival nationalisms under British rule ===
{{further|Canada under British Imperial rule}}
Reactions to British and American encroachments produced movements for solidarity between native tribes across much of eastern North America during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] of 1759 and [[Tecumseh's Rebellion]] of 1811.  By the end of the [[War of 1812]], however, natives had lost their national [[sovereignty]] across most of [[Eastern Canada]].

The influx of British settlers into Canada helped to prompt the development of [[French-Canadian nationalism]] which was quite evident during the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|1837 rebellion against British rule in Lower Canada]].  At the same time a few English-speakers in Upper Canada were switching from a British to a Canadian form of identity, as evidenced in the contemporaneous [[Upper Canada Rebellion]], although this was a minority position.

Not long afterwards, many English-speakers in Canada became attracted to [[American nationalism]], in the form of [[annexation movements of Canada|annexationism]], highlighted by the [[Montreal Annexation Manifesto]] of 1850.

[[Irish nationalism]] in its strong form of [[physical force Irish republicanism]] was evident in Canada during the [[Fenian Raids]] of the 1860s and assassination of [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] in 1868.

=== Nationalism and Confederation ===
When the [[Canadian Confederation]] was established in 1867, British and Canadian forms of identity and political allegiance continued to coexist.  In 1891 election, Prime Minister [[Sir John A. Macdonald]], himself a Scotsman, wrapped himself in the [[Union Jack]], swore to keep Canada British, and called proposals for [[Reciprocity (Canada)|freer trade with the United States]] "veiled treason".

In [[Western Canada]], native tribes retained their autonomy from Canadian society far longer than in the east.  The interaction of European and Canadian traders with Indians in the interior led to the [[ethnogenesis|creation of an entirely new nation]], the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]. Along with Indian allies, the Métis asserted their national rights during the two Riel Rebellions ([[Red River Rebellion|1870]] and [[North-West Rebellion|1885]]).

=== The turn of the 20th century to the Great Wars ===
The project of [[Imperial Federation]] (creating a federal government for the entire British Empire), had important advocates in English Canada (the "imperialists") around the turn of the 20th century, but it ultimately floundered due opposition from ("anti-imperialist" or "nationalist") French-Canadian leaders such as [[Henri Bourassa]] and [[Wilfrid Laurier]], and to indifference in Britain.

"British feeling" in Canada was in decline following the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] in 1903, in which Britain sided with the United States' border claims over Canada's.  Imperialists in Canada tried to correct this with the creation of the [[Empire Club of Canada]] that same year.

Newfoundland had persistently resisted offer to join the Canadian Confederation since 1867, and so was elevated to the status of a [[dominion]] in 1907, co-equal to Canada within the British Empire. This further solidified Newfoundlander identity and added a period of separate nationhood to the later mythos of Newfoundland.

By the 1910 Canadian federal election&amp;nbsp;– which again centred on trade with the United States and also the creation of a [[Canadian Navy]] separate from the British Royal Navy&amp;nbsp;– Prime Minister [[Laurier]] complained that in Quebec he was called an imperialist, in Ontario a separatist, but, he protested, he was simply a Canadian.

Canadian participation in the [[World Wars]] was both divisive and unifying in different ways.  French Canadians resisted the implementation of [[conscription]] during the crises of [[conscription crisis of 1917|1917]] and [[conscription crisis of 1944|1944]], leading to an erosion of [[francophone]] identification with the Canadian federation.  In contrast English Canadians, especially recent immigrants from England, rallied to join the military in large numbers out of a sense of British loyalism. They saw their experience of the war, fighting in the [[Canadian Corps]], as "the birth of a nation", when Canada replaced Britain as their primary focus of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nersessian|first=Mary|date=April 9, 2007|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070402/vimy_90years_070402 |title=Vimy battle marks birth of Canadian nationalism|work=CTV News|publisher=Bell Media|location=Toronto}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215182932/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070402/vimy_90years_070402 |date=February 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Tim|year=2008|title=Shock troops: Canadians fighting the Great War, 1917–1918|location=Toronto|publisher=Viking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the wars ===
Canadian ties with Britain were loosened when Canada became fully legislatively independent of the United Kingdom by the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], created its own [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|citizenship law in 1946]], and [[Great Canadian Flag Debate|its own flag in 1965]].  [[Newfoundland Act|Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949]], though Newfoundlander identity did not disappear.

In Quebec traditional religion- and culture-focused French-Canadian nationalism was being replaced with a new [[statism|state-centred]] [[Quebecois nationalism]] during the [[Quiet Revolution]], leading many to adopt the goal of [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec's secession from the Canadian confederation]].  This has for the most part been a peaceful movement, aside from a string of terrorist attacks by the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) in 1969 and 1970, leading to a [[October Crisis|government crackdown in 1970]].

Since the 1970s, there have also been movements that have sought to turn the habitual feelings of [[Western alienation in Canada|Western alienation]] into a movement for [[Western separatism]] or [[Alberta separatism]], although these movements often overlap with annexationist movements.

Also since the 1960s and 1970s there has been a revival of Aboriginal nationalism in Canada.  This can take the form of identification with a specific band or tribe or with First Nations in general.  Cree and Inuit nationalism in northern Quebec (which is generally mutually exclusive with Quebecois nationalism) lead to the [[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]] (1975) which was concerned with [[native title]] over northern Quebec's [[crown lands]].  However the potential fate of northern Quebec if Quebec were to secede from Canada remains a point of controversy.  Inuit activism (perhaps nationalism) has led to the creation of the federal territory of [[Nunavut]] (1994) and intra-provincial territories of [[Nunavik]] (in Quebec), [[Nunatsiavut]] (in Newfoundland and Labrador), and the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]] (in the Northwest Territories and Yukon).

== Present day ==
[[Diaspora nationalism]]s are quite common in Canada, with nearly every diaspora community in the world represented.  Prior to the liberalization of Canadian immigration laws in the 1960s, the largest diaspora populations were groups with European or Near Eastern origins like [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian]], [[Irish nationalism|Irish]], [[Azerbaijani nationalism|Azerbaijani]]  or [[Armenian nationalism|Armenian]] nationalists, and [[Zionists]] (people who support the existence of [[Israel]]).  These have since been joined by groups from other continents, especially Asia, such as [[Khalistan movement|Punjabi Sikhs]], [[Tamil nationalism|Sri Lankan Tamils]], etc.

{{As of|2012}} the two largest strains of nationalism in Canada are [[Canadian nationalism]] and [[Quebec nationalism]].  Most citizens of Canada have a strong sense of loyalty towards Canada and other Canadians, however this is tempered with strong [[regions of Canada|regional]] and [[ethnic groups in Canada|ethnic]] identities and an affinity towards a common [[North American culture]] shared with the United States.  Most non-Aboriginal English-speakers in Canada consider Canada to be their "nation" and are hostile towards any proposals to divide the Canadian Confederation into smaller states, or join it to the United States.  French-speakers in Quebec generally refer to Quebec, and not Canada, as their "nation"&amp;nbsp;– although they may also have a strong sense of Canadian-ness and many "[[soft nationalists]]" are [[Quebec federalism|federalists]] (wanting to remain in Canada) rather than sovereigntists (seeking separation).  Linguistic minorities ([[French-speakers outside of Quebec]] and [[Quebec Anglophones|English-speakers in Quebec]]) tend to be passionately pro-Canadian, seeing the continuation of Confederation as their only guarantee of continued cultural survival.  A minority of the public in provinces other than Quebec also think of their province as their main source of loyalty, instead of Canada.  Aboriginal peoples may (or may not) think of their band or tribe as their primary sources of identification, and may at the same time reject Canada as a colonial state or feel no animosity towards Canada (although resentment of perceived instances of racism is high).  Recent immigrant groups are often accused in the populist media of being insufficiently loyal to Canada (e.g. being called "[[Canadians of convenience]]") but generally most Canadians find no conflict in being loyal to Canada and retaining a sense of ethnic identity and connection to the homeland.

According to the political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], Canada should be seen as a multinational country. All Canadians are members of Canada as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, and this is a community that contains many other kinds within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, and civic (the provincial and municipal governments) sorts, but also national communities, which often include or overlap with many of the other kinds. He thus recognizes the following nations within Canada: those formed by the various aboriginal First Nations, that of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians.&lt;ref name="Blattberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blattberg|first=Charles|title=Shall We Dance?

==Origins of the term==
Commentators disagree about the precise origin of the use of the term ''penumbra'' in American legal scholarship, but most believe it was first used in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [https://lawreview.richmond.edu/files/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 478–81 (2011) and Henry T. Greely, ''A Footnote to "Penumbra" in Griswold v. Connecticut'', 6 {{smallcaps|Const.

Q.}} 81 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Burr Henly, for example, traces the first use of the word to an 1873 law review article written by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], in which he argued that it is better for new law to grow "in the penumbra between darkness and light, than to remain in uncertainty".&lt;ref&gt;Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 Hastings Const. L. Q. 81, 83–84 (1987) (quoting Holmes, ''The Theory of Torts'', 7 {{smallcaps|Am. L. Rev.}} 652, 654 (1873), ''reprinted in'' 44 {{smallcaps|Harv. L. Rev.}} 773, 775 (1931)).&lt;/ref&gt; Luis Sirico and Henry T. Greely, on the other hand, trace the term to Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field]]'s 1871 circuit court opinion in ''Montgomery v. Bevans'', where Justice Field used the term to describe a period of time in which it was uncertain whether an individual could legally be considered deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L.

Connecticut'', 6 {{smallcaps|Const. Comment.}} 251, 252-53 (1989) (noting "its first use in 1871").&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators, including Glenn H. Reynolds and Brannon P. Denning, note that elements of penumbral reasoning can be found in much older cases that precede the first use of the term ''penumbra''; they trace the origins of penumbral reasoning to United States Supreme Court cases from the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn H. Reynolds, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3696&amp;context=penn_law_review ''Penumbral Reasoning on the Right''], 140 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L.

Maryland]]'', 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819)).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Reynolds and Denning describe [[Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]]'s opinion in ''[[McCulloch v.

Although the meaning of the term has varied over time,&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 481 (2011) (discussing evolution in the term's definition prior to ''Griswold v.

Denning &amp; Glenn Harlan Reynolds, ''Comfortably Penumbral'', 77 {{smallcaps|B.U. L. Rev.}} 1089, 1092 (1997) (discussing contemporary understanding of the term).&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the term was originally derived from its primary scientific meaning, which is "a space of partial illumination (as in an eclipse) between the perfect shadow on all sides and the full light".&lt;ref name = Henly83/&gt; By analogy, rights that exist in the constitution's penumbra can be found in the "shadows" of other portions constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Alex Kozinski &amp; Eugene Volokh, ''A Penumbra Too Far'', 106 {{smallcaps|Harv. L.

J.L. Gender &amp; Soc'y}} 145 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Brannon P. Denning and Glenn H.

Denning &amp; Glenn Harlan Reynolds, ''Comfortably Penumbral'', 77 {{smallcaps|B.U. L. Rev.}} 1089, 1092 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn H. Reynolds has also characterized penumbral reasoning as a process of "reasoning-by-interpolation" where judges identify the full scope and extent of constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn H. Reynolds, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3696&amp;context=penn_law_review ''Penumbral Reasoning on the Right''], 140 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L. Rev.}} 1333, 1334–36 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions prior to ''Griswold v. Connecticut''===
The term ''penumbra'' first appeared in an opinion published by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;Sirico identifies ''Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf'', 240 U.S. 403, 426 (1916) (Holmes, J., concurring), as the first appearance of the term in an opinion published by the Supreme Court of the United States. See Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 479 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and the term appeared ten more times in published opinions between 1916 and 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480–81 (2011) (providing statistics between 1916 and 1941).&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1941 and the date of publication of ''Griswold v. Connecticut'', the term was used eight times by Justice William O. Douglas and four times by other Justices.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480–81 (2011) (providing statistics between 1941 and 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] Judge [[Learned Hand]] also used the term eleven times between 1915 and 1950, usually to place emphasis on words or concepts that were ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480 (2011). In these eleven opinions, Sirico also includes opinions written by Judge Hand in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Commissioner v. Ickelheimer'', Judge Hand wrote, "[t]he colloquial words of a statute have not the fixed and artificial content of scientific symbols; they have a penumbra, a dim fringe, a connotation, for they express an attitude of will, into which it is our duty to penetrate and which we must enforce ungrudgingly when we can ascertain it, regardless of imprecision in its expression".&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480 (2011) (citing ''Comm'r v. Ickelheimer'', 132 F.2d 660, 662 (2d Cir. 1943) (Hand, J., dissenting)).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before ''Griswold'', different Supreme Court Justices would often utilize different definitions of the term in different contexts, possibly because the Justices did not understand the meaning of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 482 (2011) (discussing hypotheses for why different definitions emerged).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Schlesinger v. Wisconsin'', for example, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] used the term to describe rights derived by implication.&lt;ref&gt;Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 87 (1987) (describing Justice Holmes' references to "a protective penumbra created by certain provisions of the Bill of Rights").&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "the law allows a penumbra to be embraced that goes beyond the outline of its object in order that the object may be secured".&lt;ref&gt;''Schlesinger v. Wisconsin'', {{ussc|volume=270 |page=230|pin=241|year=1926}} (Holmes, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'', Justice Holmes argued that evidence obtained through [[wire-tapping]] should not be admitted at trial, and that "the penumbra of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments covers the defendant".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'', {{ussc|volume=277|page=438|pin=469|year=1928}} (Holmes, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States|A.L.A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'', Justice [[Benjamin Cardozo]] used the term to describe an area of uncertainty in the law.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 480 (2011) (noting that Justice Cardozo "used 'penumbra' to refer to an area of indeterminacy in the law"); see also Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 88 (1987) (describing Justice Cardozo's use of the term to refer to "an area of uncertainty").&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "[t]here is no penumbra of uncertainty obscuring judgment here. To find immediacy or directness here is to find it almost everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States|A.L.A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|volume=295|page=495|pin=554|year=1935}} (Cardozo, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'', Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] used the term in a manner that was more closely related to its traditional definition.&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 481 (2011) (discussing Justice Frankfurter's use of the term).&lt;/ref&gt; When arguing that a group of legislators lacked [[Standing (law)|standing]], he wrote, "[n]o doubt the bounds of such legal interest have a penumbra which gives some freedom in judging fulfillment of our jurisdictional requirements".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'', {{ussc|volume=307|page=433|pin=465|year=1939}} (Frankfurter, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition after ''Griswold v. Connecticut''===
[[File:Justice William O Douglas.jpg|thumb|220px|right|upright|In ''Griswold'', Justice [[William O. Douglas]] (pictured) explained that "specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance".&lt;ref name = Griswold484&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 484.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
J. Christopher Rideout and Burr Henly note that the term achieved prominence after Justice Douglas' majority opinion in ''Griswold v. Connecticut'' held that a right to privacy existed in the penumbra of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;J. Christopher Rideout, [http://www.alwd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pdf/jalwd-fall-2010-rideout.pdf ''Penumbral Thinking Revisited: Metaphor in Legal Argumentation''], 7 J. ALWD 155, 156 (2010); see also Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 83 (1987) ("Commentators sometimes discuss Douglas' ''Griswold'' penumbra as if the metaphor had never before appeared in American jurisprudence.").&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Griswold'', the Supreme Court ultimately held that a [[Connecticut]] law that criminalized the use of [[contraception]] was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name = Griswold482-83&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 482–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Douglas held that the Connecticut law violated a fundamental right to privacy.&lt;ref name = Griswold482-83/&gt; After reviewing a line of cases in which the Supreme Court identified rights not explicitly enumerated in the constitution, Justice Douglas declared that "[t]he foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance".&lt;ref name = Griswold484/&gt; Justice Douglas argued that the Court could infer a right to privacy by looking at "zones of privacy" protected by [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First]], [[Third Amendment of the United States Constitution|Third]], [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourth]], [[Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fifth]], and [[Ninth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Ninth]] Amendments:

{{quote|Various guarantees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers "in any house" in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."&lt;ref name = Griswold484/&gt;}}

Consequently, Justice Douglas argued that the constitution included "penumbral rights of privacy and repose."&lt;ref&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 485 (internal quotations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Douglas also remarked that without "peripheral rights," the "specific rights" enumerated in the constitution would be "less secure".&lt;ref&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 479, 482, 484.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Burr Henly, Justice Douglas' majority opinion did not use the term to identify the articulable boundaries of language and the law, as Justice Holmes had done, but rather to connect the text of the constitution to [[unenumerated rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 96 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly analysis of penumbral reasoning==
Helen Hershkoff has described penumbral reasoning as "an important feature of American constitutional practice in cases involving individual rights and government power",&lt;ref&gt;Helen Hershkoff, [http://www.buffalolawreview.org/past_issues/59_2/Hershkoff.pdf ''Horizontality and the "Spooky" Doctrines of American Law''], 59 {{smallcaps|Buffalo L. Rev.}} 455, 486–487 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and J. Christopher Rideout notes that many scholars have defended the "conceptual integrity" of penumbral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;J. Christopher Rideout, [http://www.alwd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pdf/jalwd-fall-2010-rideout.pdf ''Penumbral Thinking Revisited: Metaphor in Legal Argumentation''], 7 J. ALWD 155, 184 (2010); see also David Luban, ''The Warren Court and the Concept of a Right'', 34 {{smallcaps|Harv. Civ. Rights-Civ. Liberties L. Rev.}} 7 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Burr Henly has described the penumbra as "the most important" metaphor in American constitutional jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Burr Henly, [http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V15/I1/Henly.pdf ''"Penumbra": The Roots of a Legal Metaphor''], 15 {{smallcaps|Hastings Const. L. Q.}} 81, 83 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, including Judge [[A. Raymond Randolph]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] and historian [[David J. Garrow]], also note that Justice Douglas' identification of the right to privacy in ''Griswold'' ultimately served as a doctrinal stepping-stone to ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', where the United States Supreme Court ruled that the right to privacy protects the right to [[abortion|terminate a pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Raymond Randolph, [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol29_No3_Randolph.pdf ''Before'' Roe v. Wade: ''Judge Friendly's Draft Abortion Opinion''], 29 {{smallcaps|Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y}} 1035, 1045 (2006); {{smallcaps|David J. Garrow, Liberty and Sexuality: The Right to Privacy and the Making of ''Roe v. Wade''}} 519, 525 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Glenn H. Reynolds has also observed that courts routinely engage in penumbral reasoning, regardless of their location on the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Harlan Reynolds, ''Guns, Privacy, and Revolution'', 68 {{smallcaps|Tenn. L. Rev.}} 635, 643 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] and [[UCLA School of Law]] professor [[Eugene Volokh]] note that the use of penumbral reasoning by courts "cuts both ways" because it can be used to both expand individual liberties and to expand the powers of the government at the expense of individual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Kozinski &amp; Eugene Volokh, ''A Penumbra Too Far'', 106 {{smallcaps|Harv. L. Rev.}} 1639, 1657 (1993) (citing Justice Black's dissenting opinion in ''Griswold'').&lt;/ref&gt; Richard E. Levy also argued that penumbral reasoning, [[fundamental rights]] analyses, and [[political process theory|political-process theory]] can justify judicial intervention on behalf of individual liberty as well as judicial intervention to advance economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Levy, ''Escaping Lochner's Shadow: Toward a Coherent Jurisprudence of economic Rights'', 73 {{smallcaps|N.C. L. Rev.}} 329, 364 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the "pivotal" role that penumbral reasoning has played in American constitutional jurisprudence, the Supreme Court's use of penumbral reasoning has also generated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;J. Christopher Rideout, [http://www.alwd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pdf/jalwd-fall-2010-rideout.pdf ''Penumbral Thinking Revisited: Metaphor in Legal Argumentation''], 7 J. ALWD 155, 156–57 (2010) (discussing controversy associated with penumbral reasoning).&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|District of Columbia Circuit]] Judge [[Robert Bork]], for example, was a particularly vocal critic of Supreme Court rulings that identified rights that are not explicitly enumerated in the text of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn H. Reynolds, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3696&amp;context=penn_law_review ''Penumbral Reasoning on the Right''], 140 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L. Rev.}} 1333, 1333 (1992) (discussing Judge Bork's criticisms of penumbral reasoning).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in his dissenting opinion in ''Griswold'', Justice [[Hugo Black]] stated his concerns with finding a right to privacy in the penumbra of the constitution and that he disagreed with the majority's attempts to "stretch" the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Griswold'', 381 U.S. at 508 (Black, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Louis J. Sirico Jr. has described the term as "intellectually confusing",&lt;ref&gt;Louis J. Sirico, Jr., [http://lawreview.richmond.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Sirico-4523.pdf ''Failed Constitutional Metaphors: The Wall of Separation and the Penumbra''], 45 {{smallcaps|U. Rich. L. Rev.}} 459, 488 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and William J. Watkins, Jr. wrote that the penumbra of the constitution is "a seemingly strange place to discover constitutional guarantees".&lt;ref&gt;William J. Watkins, Jr., ''The Driver's Privacy Protection Act: Congress Makes A Wrong Turn'', 49 {{smallcaps|S.C. L. Rev.}} 983, 996 n.124 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Pushaw Jr. also described penumbral reasoning as a "transparently fictional" process,&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Pushaw Jr., ''Partial-Birth Abortion and the Perils of Constitutional Common Law'', 31 {{smallcaps|Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y}} 519, 531 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and Jennifer Fahnestock has cautioned that "implicit constitutional rights" are vulnerable to being lost "due to their lack of permanency".&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Fahnestock, [http://lawreview.law.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/lawreview/article/view/165/165 ''Renegotiating the Social Contract: Healthcare as a natural Right''], 72 {{smallcaps|U.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">The '''Perestroika Movement''' is a loose-knit intellectual tendency in academic [[political science]] which seeks to expand [[methodological pluralism]] in order to make the discipline more accessible and relevant to laypeople and non-specialist academics. Established in 2000, the movement was organized in response to the perceived hegemony of quantitative and mathematical methodology in the field. Such dominance breeds academic isolation and poor scholarship, the movement's leaders contend.

==Origins==

The Perestroika Movement began in 2000 with an anonymous e-mail message sent by one “Mr. [[Perestroika]]” to the editors of the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' calling for "a dismantling of the [[Orwellian system]] that we have in [[American Political Science Association|APSA]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/OnTheIrrelevanceOfApsaAndApsrToTheStudyOfPoliticalScience E-mail from Mr. Perestroika, October 17, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; The message went to seventeen recipients who quickly forwarded it to others, and within weeks the Perestroika Movement became a force calling for change in the American political science community (Monroe 2005).

==Migration history==
[[File:Niños polacos de Santa Rosa, Guanajuato.jpg|thumb|left|Polish children that arrived as refugees in Santa Rosa, [[Guanajuato]].]]
The first Poles arrived in Mexico during the [[French intervention in Mexico]]. In May 1942, Mexico declared war on Germany. To show solidarity with the Polish people, Mexico accepted in 1943 over 2,000 Polish refugees including 1,400 Polish orphans to settle in the state of [[Guanajuato]] in central Mexico. After the war, many of the refugees remained to live in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosmopolitanreview.com/hacienda-santa-rosa/ Hacienda Santa Rosa: a Polish Refuge in Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the best known Polish-Mexicans are the journalist [[Jacobo Zabludovsky]], and his brother, the architect [[Abraham Zabludovsky (architect)|Abraham Zabludovsky]].

{{Korean caste system}}
The '''sangmin''' ({{korean|hanja=常民|hangul=상민|context=old}}) were the common people of [[Joseon]]-era Korea. About 75% of all Koreans at that time were sangmin.

==Etymology==
A more polite but less accurate name for the sangmin is '''yangmin''' ({{korean|hanja=良民|hangul=양민|context=old}}).
==History==
The sangmin consisted of peasants, laborers, fishermen, some craftsmen and merchants. The sangmin were considered "clean workers" but had little social status.  Generally they were poor. They paid most of Korea's taxes and were subject to the military draft. Their lives were hard, but they were the foundation of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], just like the [[chungin]] were the backbone of the government. Some of the sangmin owned land which they farmed. Others rented land from the [[yangban]] as tenant farmers. Those that did not farm had the lowest status. In everyday life, the sangmin were the working people who struggled to survive. The [[yangban]] and [[chungin]] controlled and ruled over them. The sangmin did the heavy work.  During the late Joseon period, particularly in the 19th century the sangmin rebelled many times because of the [[yangban]]s' oppression and corruption.

According to the 2011 census, '''Slovaks''' ({{lang-sr|Словаци/Slovaci}}) in Serbia number 52,750, constituting 0.7% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;http://popis2011.stat.rs/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; They mainly live in [[Vojvodina]] (50,321), where they constitute the third largest ethnic group after [[Serbs]] and [[Hungarians in Serbia|Hungarians]]. Like other ethnic Slovaks, they speak the [[Slovak language]], but most of them are [[Protestant]] ([[Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovakia|Evangelical-Augsburg Church]], a [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] denomination) by faith and not [[Roman Catholic]] like most Slovaks in Slovakia.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Vojvodina-Ethnic-2011-op.GIF|thumb|250px|Slovaks in Vojvodina according to the 2011 census (municipality data)]]
[[Image:Vojvodina west east slavs.png|thumb|250px|Slovak settlements in Vojvodina (2002 census)]]
Most Slovaks live in [[Kovačica (town)|Kovačica]] (8,497 Slovaks) and [[Bački Petrovac]] (5,773 Slovaks). There are two municipalities in Vojvodina with absolute or relative Slovak majorities: [[Bački Petrovac]] (with 66.4% Slovaks) and [[Kovačica (town)|Kovačica]] (with 41% Slovaks). The towns of [[Kovačica (town)|Kovačica]] and [[Bački Petrovac]] are the cultural centres of Slovaks in Vojvodina. Slovak is one of the six official languages of the provincial administration in Vojvodina.

The settlements in Vojvodina with absolute or relative Slovak majority are:
* [[Bački Petrovac]] ([[Bački Petrovac]] municipality)
* [[Kulpin, Serbia|Kulpin]] ([[Bački Petrovac]] municipality)
* [[Gložan]] ([[Bački Petrovac]] municipality)
* [[Kisač]] ([[Novi Sad]] municipality)

[[File:Slovački dom u Šidu (Srbija) Slováci v Шиду.jpg|thumb|Slovak center in Šid.]]
The modern Slovaks in Vojvodina are descendants of 18th- and 19th-century settlers, who migrated from the territory of present-day [[Slovakia]]. First Slovak settlers from area around [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra]] migrated to [[Bačka]] during the time of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Karlo I]]; in 1720 Slovaks settled in [[Bajša]], in 1740 in [[Bački Petrovac|Petrovac]] and [[Futog]], and in 1742 (during the time of [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]) in [[Bezdan]]. Some of them also later moved to [[Syrmia|Srem]]. In 1760, 120 Slovak families were settled in [[Selenča]], but they later moved to [[Stara Pazova]] in Srem.

In 1783, Slovaks settled in [[Kisač]], [[Kruščić|Veprovac]], [[Gložan]], and [[Bačka Topola|Topola]]. Part of them also settled in [[Bajša]]. In 1790-1791, Slovaks settled in [[Pivnice]], in 1792 in [[Stara Palanka]], and in 1793 in [[Novi Slankamen]]. In 1784-1787, Slovaks settled in [[Međa (Žitište)|Slovanski Bardan]]. In 1792 Slovaks settled in [[Bačka Palanka]]. Some of them moved in 1788 to [[Aradac]] and [[Ečka]], and some of them later also moved to [[Lalić]].

In 1800, Slovaks settled in [[Kovačica (town)|Kovačica]], and in 1806 and 1809 in [[Padina (Kovačica)|Padina]]. In 1806, one group of Slovaks settled in [[Čoka]], and in 1809 in [[Krajišnik, Serbia|Šupljaja]]. In 1825, Slovaks settled in [[Dušanovac, Banat|Dušanovac]], and in 1830 in [[Stari Lec]]. In 1850, 20 Slovak families were settled in [[Grk, Serbia|Grk]]. In 1868, Slovaks settled in [[Vojlovica, Pančevo|Marienfeld]], from where they later moved to [[Vojlovica, Pančevo|Vojlovica]]. In the same time, some Slovaks also settled in [[Ivanovo (Serbia)|Ivanovo]]. In 1887, Slovaks were settled in [[Belo Blato|Elizenhajm]], and in 1899 in [[Silađi]] colony near [[Apatin]]. 

According to the 1880 census, Slovaks were the sixth largest ethnic group within present-day Vojvodina, and their number was 43,318. Until the end of the [[First World War]], many of the Slovaks were [[Magyarization|Hungarized]]. According to the 2011 census, numbering 52,570, Slovaks are the sixth largest ethnic group in Serbia.

}}{{italic title|all=yes|noerror}}'''''Trociuk v British Columbia (AG)''''', 2003 SCC 34 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15(1)]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' where a father successfully challenged a provision in the British Columbia ''Vital Statistics Act'' which gave a mother complete control over the identity of the father on a child's birth certificate on the basis it violated his equality rights.

==Background==
Darrell Trociuk and Reni Ernst were an estranged unmarried couple who became parents to triplets in January 1996. When filling out the birth registration, Ernst had indicated the father was "unacknowledged by the mother" and that they were not together at the time. Consequently, she put "Ernst" as their surnames. However, Trociuk claimed they had agreed on registering the children's surnames as "Ernst-Trociuk" and tried to get the records changed to include his particulars.

Section 3(1)(b) and 4(1)(a) of the ''Vital Statistics Act'' prevented a father from amending registrations. Trociuk applied for a declaration to have the provision struck out as unconstitutional for violating his section 15 right to equality.

The Director of Vital Statistics denied the changing of the children's surnames to include their biological father's name. Trociuk then took his case to the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]], where it was upheld.

==Opinion of the court==
Deschamps J, writing for a Supreme Court, allowed the appeal in favour of Trociuk. It was found that section 3 of the Act violated section 15(1) of the ''Charter'' by allowing differential treatment based on sex. The provision had the effect of excluding the father's particulars from birth registration, excluding him from choosing his child's surname, and precluding any recourse. These effects were found to be arbitrary and created significant impact on the perception of the father's dignity, and consequently violated section 15(1).

On the [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] analysis, Deschamps J held the violation could not be saved because the law did not impair Trociuk's rights as little as reasonably possible.

'''Work-to-rule''' is an [[industrial action]] in which [[employee]]s do no more than the minimum required by the rules of their contract, and precisely follow all safety or other regulations, which may cause a [[slowdown]] or decrease in productivity, as they are no longer working during breaks or during unpaid extended hours and weekends (checking email, for instance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | title = Images of Organization| author= Gareth Morgan |publisher = Sage Publications | location= Thousand Oaks, California |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a_W8jXt4_eMC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=work-to-rule&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sz3iT_bPOIXK2AXVho3jCw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=work-to-rule&amp;f=false | date = 1998  | page =  165 | isbn = 0-7619-1752-7  | accessdate = 20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Air Canada Hit By Work-to-Rule | newspaper = The Sun | location = Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada | pages = 1–2  | date = 9 December 1968 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uJZlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yooNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6026,3158040&amp;dq=work-to-rule&amp;hl=en | accessdate = 20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an action is considered less disruptive than a [[Strike action|strike]] or [[lockout (industry)|lockout]], and obeying the rules is less susceptible to disciplinary action. Notable examples have included nurses refusing to answer telephones, teachers refusing to work for free at night and during weekends and holidays, and police officers refusing to issue citations. Refusal to work overtime, travel on duty, or sign up to other tasks requiring employee assent are other manifestations of using work-to-rule as [[industrial action]].

It was described by [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Sir John Donaldson]] as a decision to "Give the rules a meaning which no reasonable man could give them and work to that."&lt;ref&gt;Secretary of State v. ASLEF (No. 2) [1972] 2 All E.R. 949 at 959 (N.I.R.C.) per Sir John Donaldson.  Cited in {{cite book   | title = How to Do Things with Rules| author= William Twining and David Miers |publisher = Cambridge University Press|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NHUv-wpDSRkC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22Give+the+rules+a+meaning+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C-raUMaGBueH0AXj7oCYBw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Give%20the%20rules%20a%20meaning%20%22&amp;f=false | date = 2010  | page =  41 | isbn = 978-0-521-19549-2  | accessdate = 26 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term "rule-book [[slowdown]]" is used in a slightly different sense than "work-to-rule": the former involves applying to-the-letter rules that are normally set aside or interpreted less literally to increase efficiency; the latter, refraining from activities which are customary but not required by rule or [[job description]], but the terms may be used synonymously.

Work-to-rules can be misconstrued as malicious even when it is only a removal of good-will, such as employees insisting on taking all legally entitled breaks, or refusing a request to work unpaid overtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Campbell|first=Dennis|date=October 13, 2014|title=NHS unions tell Hunt: talk to us or face further strikes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/13/nhs-unions-jeremy-hunt-talk-further-strikes-pay-rise|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location= |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes work-to-rule can be considered by employers as [[malicious compliance]] as they pursue legal action against workers.  While not legally enforceable under minimum statutory law, employers may enforce customized employment contract terms that the employee agreed to:
* Overtime is waived in part, in whole, or converted to time-in-lieu
* Breaks are set by management
* Job description includes "ad-hoc task" or "as assigned"
* Termination for any reason
They may also take standard forms of action especially where custom terms were not negotiated during the offer:
* Warning and noting employee file for professional misconduct or insubordination
* Reassigning employee to insignificant, routine, or mundane tasks
