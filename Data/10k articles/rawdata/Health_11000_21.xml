'''''A Country Practice''''' is a multi-[[Logie award]]-winning Australian [[television]] [[soap opera]]/[[serial (radio and television)|serial]] [[drama]]. It ran on the [[Seven Network]] for 1,058 episodes at 7.30 pm Monday and Tuesday nights, from 18 November 1981 to 22 November 1993. It was produced at both [[ATN-7]]'s production facility at [[Epping, New South Wales]] with exterior locations filmed in [[Pitt Town]] and [[Oakville, New South Wales|Oakville]] in the outskirts of Northwest Sydney. Several of the regular cast members became highly popular celebrities through their roles in the series. It also featured a number of native Australian animals adding to its enduring appeal both domestically and internationally. After the series was cancelled by the Seven Network in 1993 a reworked version of the series ran briefly on [[Network Ten]] in 1994. ''A Country Practice'' was the longest running Australian drama upon its demise,  At its height the show attracted 8–10 million viewers weekly, when the population of the time was a mere 15 million, and was eventually sold to 48 countries.

==Founding==
''A Country Practice'' creator [[James Davern]] of JNP Productions, had worked on a previous similar type rural series, as producer and director of the long-running [[Bellbird (TV series)|Bellbird]] and had written the pilot episode for ACP and entered a script contest for the [[Ten Network]] in 1979.  He came third and won a merit award.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086689/|title=A Country Practice (TV Series 1981–1993)|author=baybee|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; although TEN turned the series down, the [[Seven Network]] picked up the series stating it liked the characters and setting. Davern would be inducted into the [[Logie Hall of Fame]] in 1991 and be honoured as an [[Order of Australia]] recipient in 2014.

==Logie Awards==
''A Country Practice'' is the third most successful television program in the history of the [[Logie Awards]], after ''[[Home and Away]]'' (1st) and ''[[Neighbours]]'' (2nd), having won 29 awards during its twelve years of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/the-logie-awards/winners/|title=TV Week Logie Awards – Past Winners|publisher=Yahoo!7 TV}}&lt;!-- Almost dead link: The URL provided currently shows links to summaries for Logies awarded in years 1989 to 2008, and links to pages 2 and 3, but these pages show the same links again.

==Format==
Though sometimes considered a [[soap opera]], the storylines of the show's two one-hour episodes screened over any one week formed a self-contained narrative block. The storylines were meant to have a primary appeal to adult and older youthful audiences, and in particular they had greater appeal to children from middle-class backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Jacinta Burke; Helen Wilson; Susanna Agardy (1983), ''"A Country Practice" and the child audience: a case study,'' Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Melbourne. {{ISBN|0-642-87073-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it did not have the open ended narrative of a traditional soap opera, it was technically a ''series''.&lt;ref name="Bowles, Kate 2000. p 127"&gt;Bowles, Kate. ''Soap opera: 'No end of story, ever' '' in ''The Australian TV Book'', (Eds. Graeme Turner and Stuart Cunningham), Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards, NSW, 2000. {{ISBN|1-86508-014-4}} p 127&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many storylines were developed as sub-plots for several episodes before becoming the focus of a particular week's narrative block. Overall, the program "so emphasized the ongoing storylines of its major characters as to make the distinction between series and serial more or less meaningless".&lt;ref name="Bowles, Kate 2000. p 127"/&gt;

==Setting and stories==
The series followed the workings of a small hospital in the fictional [[New South Wales]] rural country town of Wandin Valley as well as its connected medical clinic, the town's veterinary surgery, RSL club/pub and local police station. The show's storylines focused on the staff, and regular patients of the hospital and general practice, their families, and other residents of the town. Through its weekly guest actors, who appeared in the series portrayed differing characters, it explored various social and medical problems. The series examined such topical issues as youth [[unemployment]], [[suicide]], [[drug addiction]], [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[terminal illness]], as well as [[Australian Aborigine|Aborigines]] and their importance in modern Australian society. Apart from its regular rotating cast, mainly among the younger personnel, ''A Country Practice'' also had a cast of semi-regulars who would make appearances as the storylines permitted. One of the more popular and frequent characters from its inception included the valley's corrupt town councillor Alfred Muldoon ([[Brian Moll]]). The program as well would also showcase a number of animal stars and Australian native wildlife, most famously Fatso the wombat. Fatso was played throughout the series by three separate wombats, Fatso (1981–1986) replaced due to temperament issues with the cast, George (1986–1990) replaced due to early signs of wombat mange (a marsupial viral disease), and Garth (1990 through series end).

Iconic storylines over its lengthy 12-year run included the wedding of Dr. Simon Bowen, to local vet Vicki Dean, in 1983, and the later wedding of Dr. Terence Elliot to Matron Rosemary Prior amidst the series' bushfire scenes that marked the final episodes. The death of nurse Donna Manning in a car crash, the off-screen death of longtime resident Shirley Gilroy in a plane crash, as well as the final undoing of town councillor Alf Muldoon, which were highly watched.  The highest rating episode however featured the death of beloved farmer Molly Jones from [[leukemia]] in 1985. After being diagnosed, receiving treatment and battling the terminal illness, Molly retires to her garden, watching her husband nurse Brenden and young daughter Chloe flying a kite and passes away peacefully as the screen fades to black. Molly's death storyline was originally written for an 11-week script, but producers realized that her death was proposed in a week the ratings were not being monitored, hence the storyline lasted 13 weeks and an extra two episodes.

==Network Ten continuation==
After its lengthy run on the Seven Network, just months after its demise it was announced that the serial would be picked up by [[Network Ten]] with a mainly new cast and a few key cast members continuing from the Seven series. 
Unlike the Seven series which was produced in Sydney, the Network Ten series was produced in [[Melbourne]] with location shooting in [[Emerald, Victoria]]. The new series debuted in April 1994, but it was not as successful as its predecessor and was abruptly cancelled in November.

==Celebrity guest stars==
''A Country Practice'' became renowned for its long list of guest cameos, totalling over 1000 stars, with well known mainly Australian actors (predominately of the period) who would appear in each week's two part episode arc, similar to other such series like ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', including for example: [[Ray Meagher]], [[Amanda Muggleton]] and [[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]] regulars [[Tom Richards (actor)|Tom Richards]] and [[Leila Hayes]]. Some actors became more prominent during the series runs, and were classified as semi-regulars, appearing as the storyline permitted, Famous international stars included: [[Baz Luhrmann]], [[Smokey Dawson]], [[John Meillon]] (the program would also feature Meillon's one time wife [[June Salter]]), Sir [[Robert Helpmann]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Peter Phelps]] and [[Simon Baker]]. At the program's height even the then [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Bob Hawke]], appeared as himself.

==DVD release==
In late 2005, MRA Entertainment announced they had obtained the rights to release the entire series on DVD. In 2008, Magna Pacific Pty Ltd bought out MRA Entertainment, with plans to release Series 6, however the rights were then acquired by Beyond Home Entertainment which then re-released the first 5 seasons in 2007-2008, followed by Season 6 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acountrypractice.com/Stuff/DVDs/full-season-sets.html|title=A Country Practice - Full Episode DVD Box Sets|website=www.acountrypractice.com|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2018 Beyond Home Entertainment haven't received the rights to release further seasons.

==Broadcast History==
Aired on the [[Seven Network]] Monday and Thursday nights at 19:30.

Seven aired repeats at 09:30 weekday mornings from 1996–2002.

Foxtel's Hallmark Channel broadcast the complete series twice (including the short lived [[Network TEN]] series) from 2002 to 30 June 2010. Also Replayed a few episodes in 2014 on channel 7two at 2pm Monday to Friday.

==International Broadcasts==
===United Kingdom===
In addition to being broadcast in Australia, the series also had a successful run on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network in the United Kingdom. Shown regionally from October 1982 to March 1999 (HTV), episodes were initially shown in their original format as a one-hour episode per week (Wednesdays), however, from 1984, Yorkshire Television screened it as two half-hour editions over two days (Mondays and Tuesdays). This format eventually led to the series being stripped Monday to Friday as five continuous daily episodes, and by 1990, the half-hour format was adopted across most of the ITV network.

Considered a daytime soap and notably several years behind Australian broadcasts, ''A Country Practice'' was very popular in the UK and achieved consolidated viewing figures of between 2–3 million which is good for daytime television. To that end, some regions (HTV and Granada) moved the later episodes of the series to an early evening slot of 17.10–17.40.

'''ITV Broadcasts'''
* ''A Country Practice'' was broadcast on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network and was screened at different times, on different days, by all 14 regional companies. Originally, the series was partly networked by [[Thames Television]] to a cluster of regions and began 27 October 1982 airing on Wednesdays at 14:45 in the original hour-long format. In October 1984, Yorkshire Television broke away from the network transmissions and began editing each episode into two half-hour episodes. TVS and Thames followed in 1988, and by 1990, all regions (except Scottish) adopted this method which allowed the series to be stripped Monday to Friday in a daytime slot, usually before or after the lunchtime edition of ''Home and Away''. This also resulted in curtailment of the full closing credits in certain regions. Due to the content of some episodes, a substantial amount were withdrawn from transmission by some regions as the content was considered unsuitable for daytime viewing and this inevitably led to considerable chunks of the story being skipped.
* [[Yorkshire Television]] started ''A Country Practice'' in October 1982 but broke away from the main Network transmission in October 1984 and was the first television station in the world to break the programme into two half-hour episodes, screening on Mondays and Tuesdays at 15:30. This led to continuity problems as whenever a public holiday occurred (usually on Monday), the 15:30 slot would be unavailable. The series was moved to back to an early afternoon hour-long format in 1988 when ''Sons and Daughters'' was stripped five afternoons a week at 15:30. ''A Country Practice'' then replaced ''Sons and Daughters'' when that series ended in March 1989, being again split into half-hour episodes and now being shown five afternoons a week for the first time. It was then moved to an early afternoon slot, and eventually hour-long episodes were reinstated. The series concluded in March 1998 and the Network Ten series was not shown.  When [[Tyne Tees Television]] merged with Yorkshire, a number of episodes were skipped. This was to allow an alignment of schedules for the two regions.
* [[ITV Central|Central Television]] first broadcast ''A Country Practice'' on Tuesdays, 11:10, during summer 1983, but by September, the series had been shelved. Five years later on 16 September 1988, the series returned in the original hourly format, on Fridays at 14:00. From 2 January 1990, the series was stripped in half-hour episodes Monday to Friday at lunchtime. Central concluded the original series in August 1998 and immediately commenced the short-lived Network 10 series of ''A Country Practice''. The network had shown the entire 12 year series in 10 years, considerably less than the rest of the ITV network, even though it was the last region to start showing it.
* [[Scottish Television]] started broadcasting the series in 1983 and always aired ''A Country Practice'' as hour-long episodes. Throughout the 1980s the programme moved about in time and day but was generally broadcast once a week in an afternoon slot. In January 1994, after (episode #486), it was dropped from the schedules for about 4 months until June. From episode 491 screened every weekday morning at 10:55 for the duration of the summer school holidays (around 6 weeks) until 2 September. It reverted to its old weekly Tuesday slot the following week. It was the dropped completely after episode #588, during 1996. Although the company took over [[Grampian Television]], the series continued until the end, doing so by airing daily episodes during the summer of 1998.
* [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]] started the series on Wednesday, 26 October 1983, broadcasting 1 hour episodes until 1990, when the series moved to 15:25 Wed-Fri as replacement for Sons and Daughters in half-hour format. From September 1993, moved to earlier time slot, but from March 1994, began airing in the 17:10–17:40 slot. By the end of 1998, the series had been reduced to being shown on Thursdays and Fridays only. From January to March 1999, the series was shown on Tuesday through to Friday until Friday 5 March 1999 when the final Channel Seven episode was reached. HTV were the last ITV region to complete the series(although they did not air the short lived Channel 10 series).
* [[Carlton Television]], who superseded Thames Television, became the first region to conclude the series, followed closely by [[Anglia Television]] in the daily 13:50 half-hour slot in April 1996. Anglia Television then commenced a short repeat of the first 40 episodes shortly after reaching the end. [[Granada Television]], from 1994 until they aired the last episode during the autumn of 1996, moved the series to the later 17.10 slot.

'''Satellite and Cable Broadcasts'''
* In the mid-1980s, ''A Country Practice'' was a prime-time series on [[Sky Channel (Australia)|Sky Channel]], airing twice a week at 20:00 from at least 1985. During August 1985, the series was screened at 19:20 and 20:10 on Tuesday and Thursday evenings in hour-long episodes and by 1986, it was screened at 20:00. The channel also screened ''[[The Sullivans]]'' and ''[[The Young Doctors]]''. When the Sky Channel was launched on the new [[Astra 1A]] satellite in January 1989, it became [[Sky1]] and ''A Country Practice'' was dropped from the schedule.  For a brief period, later episodes were shown in 1997 on the cable channel [[Carlton Select]].

A Country Practice only screened in England once unlike other soap opera/serials such as ''[[Prisoner]]'' that was broadcast multiple times and also ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]''

''A Country Practice'' also aired in Ireland, [[New Zealand]], Germany, France, Italy, [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Kenya]], and was carried on several United States and Canada stations, both during the show's lifetime and after.

It was estimated that at its height, the show received a worldwide audience of five to six million each week.

===Ireland===
aired on [[RTÉ Two]] weekdays at 18:00 or 18.30. In Autumn 1988, to make way for ''[[Home and Away]]'', it moved to main channel [[RTÉ One]] airing weekdays at 17:30. The final episode (1088) aired in 1996.&lt;ref name="RTÉ One and Two TV listings"&gt;{{cite web|title=RTÉ TV Listings 1981 – 1996|url=http://tvlistings.thetvroomplus.com/?id=6:ca|accessdate=23 April 2010|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730024510/http://tvlistings.thetvroomplus.com/?id=6:ca|archive-date=30 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] stripped episodes into a 30-minute timeslot. [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] commenced a repeat in 1998 beginning with season 8 (1988) in a morning slot.

===France===
A Country Practice was named "À Coeur Ouvert".

===Germany===
A Country Practice was named "Das Buschkrankenhaus".

===Italy===
A Country Practice was named "Wandin Valley".

===Norway===
A Country Practice (called "Hverdagsliv") was broadcast on TV2 during the 1990s

===Kenya===
was also transmitted on Kenyan Television (VoK now KBC) during the 1980s.

===Zimbabwe===
broadcast on ZBC state television in the 1980s

===New Zealand===
was transmitted on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] on Sunday afternoons in the late 1980s and early 1990s

===Canada===
The entire series was broadcast, from start to finish, by [[CBC Television]] outlet [[CBET-DT|CBET]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Two episodes were broadcast daily, Monday through Friday, starting in the late 1980s, until they were caught up to contemporary episodes in the early 1990s. Its inclusion on CBET's schedule was out of necessity to fill a television schedule: because Windsor was part of the same advertising market as [[Detroit]], Michigan in the [[United States]], they are subject to the North American Border Protection Rule, under which Detroit television stations cannot carry programming licensed for broadcast in Windsor, and Windsor stations cannot carry programming licensed for broadcast in Detroit. Most American programming that was part of the CBC schedule throughout Canada could not be broadcast by CBET and, thus, was replaced by programming imported from Britain and Australia. Many Australian soap operas, ''A Country Practice'' among them, have thus found loyal audiences in the Metro Detroit area, while they otherwise remain unknown in North America.

From 1991 to 1994, the show also aired on [[CTV Two Atlantic|ASN]], a cable network that served Canada's [[The Maritimes|Maritimes]]. Four hour-long episodes aired each week, from Monday to Thursday with Monday's and Tuesday's episodes repeated on Saturday and Wednesday's and Thursday's episodes on Sunday. The station aired the show from episode 1 to somewhere in the early 700s.

ASN ceased carrying the show when specialty cable channel [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] was launched on 1 January 1995, as they picked up ''A Country Practice'' for broadcast throughout Canada. It broadcast one episode daily, from Monday to Friday, and completed the entire series run (including the 30-episode Network Ten series) in June 1999. It began rebroadcasting the entire series on 28 June 1999, with promises that the entire series would be broadcast for those who missed the first airing. However, a single line of text scrolling across the bottom of the screen during the 21 August 2000, episode announced that the show would be removed from the Showcase lineup as of Monday, 28 August 2000. According to the station's email autoresponse at the time, the decision was based on "declining viewership and a demand by viewers for more current programming". Sometime after that, Showcase changed their format to favour a less family-oriented and more adult-oriented viewership.

==Novel==
Series writer Judith Colquhoun, who also wrote episodes for other Australian serials, ''[[Blue Heelers]]'', ''[[Neighbours]]'' and ''[[Home and Away]]'' released a novel in 2015.  Called ''New Beginnings'', it is based on the early episodes of the series from 1981.

The current status of abortion in [[Venezuela]] is exacerbated by the economic crisis fueled by a lack of access to healthcare. Despite limited financial means due to the crisis, some groups are advocating for abortion rights.

==Terminology==
Any surgical or medicinal method of termination of a pregnancy can be classified as an induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Induced-Abortion#what |website=Women's Health Care Physicians |publisher=The American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A clandestine abortion is one that is not performed under proper medical care or safe conditions. Since abortion is illegal in Venezuela, a clandestine procedure is often the only choice that a woman has in terminating an unwanted pregnancy, unless she is faced with certain conditions. 

Venezuela's policy on abortion follows the "indications model," meaning that it is permissible only when the pregnancy is a threat to the health of the pregnant woman, it is a result of rape, or the fetus cannot live outside of the womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drovetta |first1=Raquel Irene |title=Safe abortion information hotlines: An effective strategy for increasing women’s access to safe abortions in Latin America |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |date=27 July 2015 |volume=23 |issue=45 |pages=47-57 |doi=10.1016/j.rhm.2015.06.004 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.rhm.2015.06.004?needAccess=true |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venezuelan Penal Code==
The Venezuelan Penal code outlines regulations for having/administering an abortion procedure.

Article 340 of the Penal Code states that "a women who intentionally aborts, using means employed by herself or by a third party with their consent, shall be punished with prison for six months to two years.

Article 433 offers an exception: "a person carrying out an abortion will not incur any penalty if it is an indispensable measure to save the life of the mother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=VTActual |title=Abortion in Venezuela: An Urgent Debate |url=https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14051 |website=Venezuelanalysis |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Attitudes toward abortion policies have changed as different political leaders have assumed power in Venezuela. The economic [[crisis in Venezuela]] has served as another influence on policy Some groups are combating policies to fight for abortion rights.

===Hugo Chavez===
Hugo Chavez intended to minimize the gap between the rich and poor and give Venezuelans a better life. This, along with his intent to reform the Constitution, implies that he was in favor of abortion rights, though it was not explicitly said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCoy |first1=Jennifer |last2=Newman |first2=Laura |title=Defining the "Bolivarian revolution": Hugo Chavez's Venezuela |journal=Current History |date=February 2001 |volume=100 |issue=643 |pages=80-85 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/64ed16cf10e730f720e2a8feb97ec899/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=41559 |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Venezuela, the discovery of oil provided an economic boom lasting a period from World War 1 to the 1980s. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Corrales |first1=Javier |title=The House that Chavez Built |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/07/the-house-that-chavez-built/ |website=Foreign Policy |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period of prosperity was ended by an oil crisis in 1973, which led to a great amount of debt that continued into Chavez's presidency and topped 120 billion in 2011. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stambouli |first1=Andres |title=La Politica Extraviada |date=2009 |publisher=Fundación para la Cultura Urbana |pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Trienio Adeco period (1945-1948), Venezuela was under democratic rule by several presidents, until [[Hugo Chavez]] won Venezuela's presidential election in 1998. Chavez ruled Venezuela as a Bolivarian government starting in 1999, one that followed a left-wing socialist movement that advocated mainly for financial equity, democracy, and anti-corrupt government. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vasquez |first1=Ian |title=The Chavez Record |url=https://www.cato.org/blog/chavez-record |website=Cato @ Liberty |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] in 2007, as well as many other programs that catered to the poor, such as the “Bolivarian Missions” to provide universal healthcare coverage under 'Chavezcare' and increase educational opportunities for the poor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Peter |title=The Collapse of Chavezcare |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/27/chavez-maduro-healthcare-venezuela-cuba/ |website=Foreign Policy |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hugo Chávez and the Future of Venezuela |url=http://www.coha.org/hugo-chavez-and-the-future-of-venezuela/ |publisher=Council on Hemispheric Affairs |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his policies were plans to amend the Venezuelan constitution to decriminalize abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Ian |title=World Briefing: Americas: Venezuela: Pope Takes on Chavez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/12/world/world-briefing-americas-venezuela-pope-takes-on-chavez.html |accessdate=3 October 2018 |publisher=The New York Times |date=12 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was relatively well-liked by the poor in Venezuela, he also received some opposition. The Venezuelan National Strike of 2002-2003 started as an attempt to remove Chavez from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hugo Chávez and the Future of Venezuela |url=http://www.coha.org/hugo-chavez-and-the-future-of-venezuela/ |publisher=Council on Hemispheric Affairs |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Bart |title=Hugo! The Hugo Chávez Story From Mud Hut to Perpetual Revolution |date=2008 |publisher=The Bodley Head |location=London | pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the country's oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. ([[PDVSA]]) lost money, and since the economy largely depends on the oil industry, the nation's GDP fell significantly. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hugo Chávez and the Future of Venezuela |url=http://www.coha.org/hugo-chavez-and-the-future-of-venezuela/ |publisher=Council on Hemispheric Affairs |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Bart |title=Hugo! The Hugo Chávez Story From Mud Hut to Perpetual Revolution |date=2008 |publisher=The Bodley Head |location=London | pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this and other strikes against him, Chavez remained in office until he was too ill to run as president. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Corrales |first1=Javier |title=The House that Chavez Built |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/07/the-house-that-chavez-built/ |website=Foreign Policy |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicolas Maduro===
[[File:Nicolas Maduro, President of Venezuela.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Maduro with the President of Colombia]]

As of yet, Maduro has not mentioned plans to amend to Constitution in favor of abortion rights. After Chavez's presidency, [[Nicolas Maduro]] took over after what some call a rigged election, as Chavez appointed him. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Venezuela's Maduro says will win in 'economic war' post-election |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-election/venezuelas-maduro-says-will-win-in-economic-war-post-election-idUSKBN1IA3KM |website=Reuters |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to implement the socialist policies that Chavez started, though some argue he rules as a dictator. In 2013, Venezuela's currency lost value due to shortages in essentials such as staple foods and toiletries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Robert |title=The Venezuelan Crisis Is Due to Economic Ignorance |url=http://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=9070 |website=The Independent Institute |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Venezuela has been in an economic crisis, where inflation has reached an all-time high. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Venezuela annual inflation 180 percent: opposition newspaper |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/venezuela-annual-inflation-180-percent-opposition-newspaper-idUSKCN0RV4WN20151001 |website=Reuters |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Venezuela 2014 inflation hits 68.5 pct -central bank |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-inflation/venezuela-2014-inflation-hits-68-5-pct-central-bank-idUSL1N0VN2H720150214 |website=Reuters |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maduro issued a state of emergency in 2016, allowing Venezuelans to cross Colombian borders for greater access to necessities, though for those in compromising situations this is not a possibility. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Thousands Of Venezuelans Cross Into Colombia In Search Of Food And Medicine |accessdate=7 October 2018 |publisher=Huffington Post |date=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maduro was re-elected to office in 2018, though some continue to deem it an illegitimate election. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bahar |first1=Dany |title=US sanctions must be precise in order to spare innocent Venezuelans |url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/us-sanctions-must-be-precise-in-order-to-spare-innocent-venezuelans/ |website=Brookings |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been U.S. sanctions placed on oil export, preventing foreign entities from purchasing oil stock; this hurt Venezuela's economy because oil makes up so much of its GDP, which only aggravated the crisis. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bahar |first1=Dany |title=US sanctions must be precise in order to spare innocent Venezuelans |url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/us-sanctions-must-be-precise-in-order-to-spare-innocent-venezuelans/ |website=Brookings |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic Crisis===
The Economic Crisis In Venezuela has led to a decrease in access to contraceptives, and has caused many women to resort to sterilization and abortion as a family planning method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marillier |first1=Lou |last2=Squires |first2=Daisy |title=LACKING BIRTH CONTROL OPTIONS, DESPERATE VENEZUELAN WOMEN TURN TO STERILIZATION AND ILLEGAL ABORTION |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/06/10/venezuela-crisis-sterilization-women-abortion/ |website=The Intercept |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zuniga |first1=Mariana |title=Even sex is in crisis in Venezuela, where contraceptives are growing scarce |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/even-sex-is-in-crisis-in-venezuela-where-contraceptives-are-growing-scarce/2017/11/27/5d970d86-b452-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.859c2e114649 |accessdate=21 October 2018 |publisher=The Washington Post |date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, the crisis has left Venezuelans with a grim outlook on healthcare, as 90 percent of all citizens live in poverty. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sequera |first1=Vivian |title=Venezuelans report big weight losses in 2017 as hunger hits |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-food/venezuelans-report-big-weight-losses-in-2017-as-hunger-hits-idUSKCN1G52HA |website=Reuters |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Medicine is at a massive shortage, with over 80% of medicinal access restricted by the crisis. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zuniga |first1=Mariana |title=Even sex is in crisis in Venezuela, where contraceptives are growing scarce |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/even-sex-is-in-crisis-in-venezuela-where-contraceptives-are-growing-scarce/2017/11/27/5d970d86-b452-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.859c2e114649 |accessdate=21 October 2018 |publisher=The Washington Post |date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to Contraceptives==
Along with healthcare, particularly affected are Venezuelans’ access to [[contraceptives]].

==Sterilization &amp; Abortion==
For most, the high prices of contraceptives force them to resort to abstinence or sterilization. Though the sterilization procedure is expensive, some would rather pay over caring for children they cannot afford. This is done in lieu of later clandestine abortions. The Intercept reports that some of the women who opt for sterilization are as young as 14 years old. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marillier |first1=Lou |last2=Squires |first2=Daisy |title=LACKING BIRTH CONTROL OPTIONS, DESPERATE VENEZUELAN WOMEN TURN TO STERILIZATION AND ILLEGAL ABORTION |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/06/10/venezuela-crisis-sterilization-women-abortion/ |website=The Intercept |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Activism==
[[File:Pro-choice street art in Argentina.jpg|thumb|"Fetuses go to paradise, legalize abortion."

During his presidency, Hugo Chavez operated Venezuela under a socialist economy, which was meant to promote equality. Some groups, such as the Feminists in Free and Direct Action for Safe Abortions in Revolution, were formed during his presidency. This group, along with many others, advocates for ending dangerous clandestine abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drovetta |first1=Raquel Irene |title=Safe abortion information hotlines: An effective strategy for increasing women’s access to safe abortions in Latin America |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |date=27 July 2015 |volume=23 |issue=45 |pages=47-57 |doi=10.1016/j.rhm.2015.06.004 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.rhm.2015.06.004?needAccess=true |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly (ANC), formed in July 2017, advocates for the reformation of Venezuela's constitution to include women's right to abort beyond those outlined by the “indications model.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fuentes |first1=Federico |title=Venezuela: Activists demand new constitution enshrine abortion, sexual rights |url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/venezuela-activists-demand-new-constitution-enshrine-abortion-sexual-right |accessdate=11 September 2018 |agency=Green Left Weekly |issue=1185 |date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other efforts to support the movement include the efforts of one group to use a telephone hotline to inform women on how to safely have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drovetta |first1=Raquel Irene |title=Safe abortion information hotlines: An effective strategy for increasing women’s access to safe abortions in Latin America |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |date=27 July 2015 |volume=23 |issue=45 |pages=47-57 |doi=10.1016/j.rhm.2015.06.004 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.rhm.2015.06.004?needAccess=true |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Misoprostol]] is a drug that can be used to induce labor and cause a medical abortion, which is any abortion done via drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Rebecca |last2=O'Brien |first2=Barbara |title=Uses of Misoprostol in Obstetrics and Gynecology |journal=Reviews in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |date=Summer 2009 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=159-168 |pmid=19826573 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760893/ |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Medical Abortion |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/medical-abortion/about/pac-20394687 |website=Mayo Clinic |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hotline provides women with the ability to make an informed decision about proceeding with an abortion. It does not, however, change the legal status of abortion in Venezuela, nor does it provide women access to medical care.

The '''African clawed frog''' (''Xenopus laevis'', also known as the '''xenopus''', '''African clawed toad''', '''African claw-toed frog''' or the '''''platanna''''') is a species of African [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[frog]] of the family [[Pipidae]]. Its name is derived from the three short [[claw]]s on each hind foot, which it uses to tear apart its food. The word ''Xenopus'' means "strange foot" and ''laevis'' means "smooth".

The species is found throughout much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] ([[Nigeria]] and [[Sudan]] to [[South Africa]]),&lt;ref name=Chytrid&gt;Weldon; du Preez; Hyatt; Muller; and Speare (2004). ''[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/12/03-0804_article.htm Origin of the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus.]'' Emerging Infectious Diseases 10(12).&lt;/ref&gt; and in isolated, [[Introduced species|introduced]] populations in North America, South America, and Europe.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; All species of the family Pipidae are tongueless, [[tooth]]less and completely aquatic. They use their hands to shove food in their mouths and down their throats and a hyobranchial pump to draw or suck things in their mouth. Pipidae have powerful legs for swimming and lunging after food. They also use the claws on their feet to tear pieces of large food. They lack true ears{{Citation needed|reason=they have inner and middle ears|date=January 2016}}, but have lateral lines running down the length of the body and underside, which is how they can sense movements and vibrations in the water. They use their sensitive fingers, sense of smell, and lateral line system to find food. Pipidae are scavengers and will eat almost anything living, dying, or dead and any type of organic waste.

== Description ==
These frogs are plentiful in ponds and rivers within the south-eastern portion of Sub-Saharan Africa.  They are aquatic and are often greenish-grey in color.  [[Albino]] varieties are commonly sold as pets. "Wild type" African clawed frogs are also frequently sold as pets, and often incorrectly labeled as a Congo frog or [[African dwarf frog]] because of similar colorings.  They are easily distinguished from African dwarf frogs because African clawed frogs have webbing only on their hind feet while African dwarf frogs have webbing on all four feet.

They reproduce by fertilizing eggs outside of the female's body (see [[Frog#Reproduction of frogs|frog reproduction]]). Of the seven amplexus modes (positions in which frogs mate), these frogs are found breeding in inguinal amplexus, where the male clasps the female in front of the female's back legs and squeezes until eggs come out. The eggs are then fertilized.

The clawed frogs are the only amphibians to have actual claws used to climb and shred foods like fish or [[tadpoles]]. They lay their eggs from winter until spring. During wet rainy seasons they will travel to other ponds or puddles of water to search for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maddin HC, Eckhart L, Jaeger K, Russell AP, Ghannadan M |title=The anatomy and development of the claws of Xenopus laevis (Lissamphibia: Anura) reveal alternate pathways of structural evolution in the integument of tetrapods |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=214 |issue=4 |pages=607–19 |date=April 2009  |pmid=19422431 |pmc=2736125 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01052.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''X. laevis'' have been known to survive 15 or more years in the wild and 25–30 years in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laboratoryxenopus.com/frogfacts.html&lt;/ref&gt; They shed their skin every season, and eat their own shed skin.

Although lacking a [[vocal sac]], the males make a [[mating call]] of alternating long and short trills, by contracting the intrinsic [[Larynx|laryngeal muscles]].  Females also answer vocally, signaling either acceptance (a rapping sound) or rejection (slow ticking) of the male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garvey |first=Nathan |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Xenopus_laevis.html |title=ADW: Xenopus Laevis: Information |publisher=Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Talk of the Nation |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123651128 |title=ADW: NPR: Listening To Love Songs of African Clawed Frogs |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This frog has smooth slippery skin which is multicolored on its back with blotches of olive gray or brown. The underside is creamy white with a yellow tinge.

Male and female frogs can be easily distinguished through the following differences. Male frogs are usually about 20% smaller than females, with slim bodies and legs. Males make mating calls to attract females, sounding very much like a cricket calling underwater. Females are larger than the males, appearing far more plump with hip-like bulges above their rear legs (where their eggs are internally located).

Both males and females have a [[cloaca]], which is a chamber through which digestive and urinary wastes pass and through which the [[reproductive system]]s also empty. The cloaca empties by way of the vent which in [[reptile]]s and amphibians is a single opening for all three systems.&lt;ref&gt;Reference: National Audubon Society.

''Xenopus'' has long been an important tool for in vivo studies in molecular, cell, and developmental biology of vertebrate animals.  However, the wide breadth of ''Xenopus'' research stems from the additional fact that cell-free extracts made from ''Xenopus'' are a premier in vitro system for studies of fundamental aspects of cell and molecular biology.  Thus, ''Xenopus'' is the only vertebrate model system that allows for high-throughput in vivo analyses of gene function and high-throughput biochemistry.  Finally, ''Xenopus'' oocytes are a leading system for studies of ion transport and channel physiology.&lt;ref name="wallingford"/&gt;

Although ''X. laevis'' does not have the short generation time and genetic simplicity generally desired in genetic [[model organism]]s, it is an important model organism in [[developmental biology]], [[cell biology]], [[toxicology]] and [[neurobiology]]. ''X. laevis'' takes 1 to 2 years to reach [[sexual maturity]] and, like most of its genus, it is [[tetraploid]].   It does have a large and easily manipulated [[embryo]], however. The ease of manipulation in [[amphibia]]n embryos has given them an important place in historical and modern developmental biology.  A related species, ''[[Xenopus tropicalis]]'', is now being promoted as a more viable model for genetics.

[[Roger Wolcott Sperry]] used ''X. laevis'' for his famous experiments describing the development of the visual system. These experiments led to the formulation of the [[Chemoaffinity hypothesis]].

''Xenopus'' [[oocyte]]s provide an important expression system for [[molecular biology]]. By injecting [[DNA]] or [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] into the oocyte or developing embryo, scientists can study the protein products in a controlled system. This allows rapid functional expression of manipulated [[DNA]]s (or [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]). This is particularly useful in [[electrophysiology]], where the ease of recording from the oocyte makes expression of membrane channels attractive. One challenge of oocyte work is eliminating native proteins that might confound results, such as membrane channels native to the [[oocyte]]. Translation of proteins can be blocked or splicing of pre-mRNA can be modified by injection of [[Morpholino]] antisense oligos into the oocyte (for distribution throughout the embryo) or early embryo (for distribution only into daughter cells of the injected cell).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/gene.1042 |pmid=11477685 |title=Comparison of morpholino based translational inhibition during the development of ''Xenopus laevis'' and ''Xenopus tropicalis'' |journal=Genesis |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=110–3 |year=2001 |last1=Nutt |first1=Stephen L |last2=Bronchain |first2=Odile J |last3=Hartley |first3=Katharine O |last4=Amaya |first4=Enrique }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extracts from the eggs of ''X. laevis'' frogs are also commonly used for biochemical studies of DNA replication and repair, as these extracts fully support DNA replication and other related processes in a cell-free environment which allows easier manipulation.&lt;ref name="pmid3779837"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blow JJ, Laskey RA |title=Initiation of DNA replication in nuclei and purified DNA by a cell-free extract of Xenopus eggs |journal=Cell |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=577–87 |date=November 1986  |pmid=3779837 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(86)90622-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first vertebrate ever to be cloned was an African clawed frog, an experiment for which Sir John Gurdon was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2012 "for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2012|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, several African clawed frogs were present on the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] (which was launched into space on September 12, 1992) so that scientists could test whether reproduction and development could occur normally in zero gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&amp;dat=19920914&amp;id=TMMLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2VUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6899,5891647 |title=Ludington Daily News - Sep 14, 1992, p. 7 |publisher=News.google.com |date=1992-09-14 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19920911&amp;id=84U0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=x6MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1106,4192511 |title=Reading Eagle - Sep 11, 1992, p.

''X. laevis'' is also notable for its use in the first widely used method of [[pregnancy test]]ing, after [[Lancelot Hogben]] discovered that the [[urine]] from pregnant women induced ''X. laevis'' oocyte production. [[Human chorionic gonadotropin]] (HCG) is a [[hormone]] found in substantial quantities in the urine of pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kean |first1=Sam  |title=The Birds, the Bees, and the Froggies |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=2 |page=5 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-birds-the-bees-and-the-froggies|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, commercially available HCG is injected into ''Xenopus'' males and females to induce mating behavior and to breed these frogs in captivity at any time of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Green, SL.

Amphibian frog ''Xenopus laevis'' also serves as an ideal model system for the study of the mechanisms of apoptosis. In fact, [[iodine]] and [[thyroxine]] stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins in amphibians [[metamorphosis]], and stimulate the evolution of their nervous system transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Jewhurst K, Levin M, McLaughlin KA |title=Optogenetic Control of Apoptosis in Targeted Tissues of Xenopus laevis Embryos. |journal=J Cell Death |volume=7 |pages=25–31 |year=2014 |PMID= 25374461 |doi=10.4137/JCD.S18368 |pmc=4213186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author =Venturi, Sebastiano |title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine |journal=Current Chemical Biology- |volume=5 |pages=155–162 |year=2011 |issn=1872-3136 |doi=10.2174/187231311796765012 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author =Venturi, Sebastiano |title=Iodine, PUFAs and Iodolipids in Health and Disease: An Evolutionary Perspective |journal=Human Evolution- |volume= 29 |issue= 1-3 |pages=185–205 |year=2014 |issn=0393-9375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Tamura K, Takayama S, Ishii T, Mawaribuchi S, Takamatsu N, Ito M |title=Apoptosis and differentiation of Xenopus tail-derived myoblasts by thyroid hormone. |journal=J Mol Endocrinol. |volume=54 |number=3 |pages=185–92 |year=2015 |doi= 10.1530/JME-14-0327 |pmid=25791374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genome sequencing ===
Early work on sequencing of the ''X. laevis'' genome was started when the [http://www.bio.utexas.edu/faculty/wallingford/ Wallingford] and Marcotte labs obtained funding from the [http://www.ti3d.utexas.edu/ Texas Institute for Drug and Diagnostic Development] (TI3D), in conjunction with projects funded by the National Institutes of Health. The work rapidly expanded to include ''de novo'' reconstruction of ''X. laevis'' transcripts, in collaboration with groups around the world donating Illumina Hi-Seq RNA sequencing datasets. Genome sequencing by the Rokhsar and Harland groups (UC Berkeley) and by Taira and collaborators (University of Tokyo, Japan) gave a major boost to the project, which, with additional contributions from investigators in the Netherlands, Korea, Canada and Australia, led to publication of the genome sequence and its characterization in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Session et al.|first1=Adam|title=Genome evolution in the allotetraploid frog Xenopus laevis.|journal=Nature|date=October 19, 2016|volume=538|issue=7625|pages=336–343|doi=10.1038/nature19840|pmid=27762356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xenbase]] is the Model Organism Database (MOD) with the full details and release information regarding the current ''Xenopus laevis'' genome ([http://www.xenbase.org/other/static/ftpDatafiles.jsp 9.1]).

== As pets ==
''Xenopus laevis'' have been kept as pets and research subjects since as early as the 1950s. They are extremely hardy and long lived, having been known to live up to 20 or even 30 years in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17547979&amp;ps=rs |title=NPR December 22, 2007 |publisher=Npr.org |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African clawed frogs are frequently mislabeled as [[African dwarf frog]]s in pet stores. The astute pet owner will recognize the difference, however, because of the following characteristics:
* Dwarf frogs have four webbed feet. African clawed frogs have webbed hind feet while their front feet have autonomous digits.
* African dwarf frogs have eyes positioned on the side of their head, while African clawed frogs have eyes on the top of their heads.
* African clawed frogs have curved, flat snouts. The snout of an African dwarf frog is pointed.

== As a pest ==

African clawed frogs are voracious predators and easily adapt to many habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = James A. Danoff-Burg |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/cerc/danoff-burg/invasion_bio/inv_spp_summ/xenopus_laevis.htm |title=ADW: Columbia: Introduced Species Summary Project |publisher=Columbia.edu |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, they can easily become a harmful invasive species. They can travel short distances to other bodies of water, and some have even been documented to survive mild freezes. They have been shown to devastate native populations of frogs and other creatures by eating their young.

In 2003, ''Xenopus laevis'' frogs were discovered in a pond at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]]. Much debate now exists in the area on how to exterminate these creatures and keep them from spreading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,258519,00.html | publisher = FoxNews | title = Killer Meat-Eating Frogs Terrorize San Francisco | date=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/THE-KILLER-FROGS-OF-LILY-POND-San-Francisco-2610411.php |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |title=The Killer Frogs of Lily Pond:San Francisco poised to checkmate amphibious African predators of Golden Gate Park |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606100110/http://sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/THE-KILLER-FROGS-OF-LILY-POND-San-Francisco-2610411.php |archivedate=2013-06-06 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown if these frogs entered the San Francisco ecosystem through intentional release or escape into the wild. San Francisco officials drained Lily Pond and fenced off the area to prevent the frogs from escaping to other ponds in the hopes they starve to death.

Due to incidents in which these frogs were released and allowed to escape into the wild, African clawed frogs are illegal to own, transport or sell without a permit in the following US states: Arizona, California, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2002/07/03/news/story14.html |title=ADW: Honolulu Star-Bulletin Wednesday, July 3, 2002 |publisher=Archives.starbulletin.com |date=2002-07-03 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevada, and Washington state. However, it is legal to own ''Xenopus laevis'' in New Brunswick (Canada) and Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnb.ca/0062/regs/92-74.htm ADW: New Brunswick Regulation 92-74] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819075642/http://www.gnb.ca/0062/regs/92-74.htm |date=August 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0062/acts/ |title=ADW: New Brunswick Acts and regulations |publisher=Gnb.ca |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African clawed frog may be an important [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] and the initial source of ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'', a [[chytrid fungus]] that has been implicated in the drastic [[decline in amphibian populations]] in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Chytrid/&gt; Unlike in many other amphibian species (including the closely related [[western clawed frog]]) where this chytrid fungus causes the disease [[Chytridiomycosis]], it does not appear to affect the African clawed frog, making it an effective carrier.&lt;ref name=Chytrid/&gt;

The '''Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model - ''' is a [[conceptual model]] aimed at demonstrating the factors that lead to the use of health services. According to the model, usage of health services (including inpatient care, physician visits, dental care etc.) is determined by three dynamics: predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need. Predisposing factors can be characteristics such as race, age, and health beliefs.  For instance, an individual who believes health services are an effective treatment for an ailment is more likely to seek care. Examples of enabling factors could be family support, access to health insurance, one's community etc. Need represents both perceived and actual need for health care services. The original model was developed by Ronald M. Andersen, a health services professor at [[UCLA]], in 1968. The original model was expanded through numerous iterations and its most recent form models past the use of services to end at health outcomes and includes feedback loops.&lt;ref name="revisiting"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Ronald|title=Revisiting the behavioral model and access to medical care: does it matter?|journal=J Health Soc Behav|year=1995|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–10|pmid=7738325|doi=10.2307/2137284}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access and Mutability==
A major motivation for the development of the model was to offer measures of access. Andersen discusses four concepts within access that can be viewed through the conceptual framework. Potential access is the presence of enabling resources, allowing the individual to seek care if needed. Realized access is the actual use of care, shown as the outcome of interest in the earlier models. The Andersen framework also makes a distinction between equitable and inequitable access.  Equitable access is driven by demographic characteristics and need whereas inequitable access is a result of social structure, health beliefs, and enabling resources.

Andersen also introduces the concept of mutability of his factors. The idea here being that if a concept has a high degree of mutability (can be easily changed) perhaps policy would be justified in using its resources to do rather than a factor with low mutability. Characteristics that fall under demographics are quite difficult to change, however, enabling resources is assigned a high degree of mutability as the individual, community, or national policy can take steps to alter the level of enabling resources for an individual. For example, if the government decides to expand the [[Medicaid]] program an individual may experience an increase in enabling resources, which in turn may beget an increase in health services usage. The [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]] (HIE) changed a highly mutable factor, out-of-pocket costs, which greatly changed individual rates of health services usage.&lt;ref name="rand hie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=J|title=Free for All? Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment|year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-31846-3|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB199.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Models==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lifecycle andersen.png|thumb|right|alt=Earlier versions of the Andersen model.|Lifecycle of the Andersen Model.&lt;ref name="revisiting" /&gt;]] --&gt;
The initial behavior model was an attempt to study of why a family uses health services.  However, due to the heterogeneity of family members the model focused on the individual rather than the family as the unit of analysis. Andersen also states that the model functions both to predict and explain use of health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R|author2=Newman JF|title=Societal and individual determinants of medical care utilization in the United States|journal=Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc|year=1973|volume=51|issue=1|pages=95–124|pmid=4198894|doi=10.2307/3349613|pmc=2690261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second model was developed in the 1970s in conjunction with Aday and colleagues at the [[University of Chicago]]. This iteration includes systematic concepts of health care such as current policy, resources, and organization. The second generation model also extends the outcome of interest beyond utilization to consumer satisfaction.&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aday|first=Lu Ann|author2=Andersen R|title=A framework for the study of access to medical care|journal=Health Serv Res|year=1974|volume=9|issue=3|pmid=4436074|pmc=1071804|pages=208–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of the model builds upon this idea by including health status (both perceived and evaluated) as outcomes alongside consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, this model include personal health practices as an antecedent to outcomes, acknowledging that it not solely use of health services that drives health and satisfaction. This model emphasizes a more public health approach of prevention, as advocated by Evans and Stoddart&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=RG|author2=Stoddart GL|title=Producing health, consuming health care|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=1990|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1347–63|pmid=2126895|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(90)90074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein personal health practices (i.e. smoking, diet, exercise) are included as a driving force towards health outcomes.

== Current Model ==
The 6th iteration of Andersen’s conceptual framework &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the individual as the unit of analysis and goes beyond health care utilization, adopting health outcomes as the endpoint of interest.  This model is further differentiated from its predecessors by using a feedback loop to illustrate that health outcomes may affect aspects such as health beliefs, and need.  It added genetic susceptibility as a predisposing determinant and quality of life as an outcome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using the framework’s relationships we can determine the directionality of the effect following a change in an individual’s characteristics or environment. For example, if one experiences an increase in need as a result of an infection, the Andersen model predicts this will lead to an increased use of services (all else equal). One potential change for a future iteration of this model is to add genetic information under predisposing characteristics.&lt;ref name=true&gt;{{cite journal|last=True|first=WR|author2=et. al|title=Genetic and environmental contributions to healthcare need and utilization: a twin analysis|journal=Health Ser Res|year=1997|volume=32|issue=1|pages=37–53|pmid=9108803|pmc=1070168}}&lt;/ref&gt; As genetic information becomes more readily available it seems likely this could impact health services usage, as well as health outcomes, beyond what is already accounted for in the current model.&lt;ref name=rosenau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenau|first=PV|title=Reflections on the cost consequences of the new gene technology for health policy|journal=Int J Technol Assess Health Care|year=1994|volume=10|issue=4|pages=546–61|pmid=7843877|doi=10.1017/s0266462300008151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and Rebuttals==
The model has been criticized for not paying enough attention to culture and social interaction but Andersen argues this social structure is included in the ''predisposing characteristics'' component.&lt;ref name=guendelman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guendelman|first=S|title=Health care users residing on the Mexican border. What factors determine choice of the U.S. or Mexican health system?|journal=Med Care|year=1991|volume=29|issue=5|pages=419–29|pmid=2020207|doi=10.1097/00005650-199105000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Portes|first=A|author2=Kyle D |author3=Eaton WW |title=Mental illness and help-seeking behavior among Mariel Cuban and Haitian refugees in south Florida|journal=J Health Soc Behav|date=Dec 1992|volume=33|issue=4|pages=283–298|pmid=1464715|doi=10.2307/2137309}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-30--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Another criticism was the overemphasis of  need and at the expense of health beliefs and social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolinsky|first=FD|author2=Johnson RJ|title=The use of health services by older adults|journal=J Gerontol|date=Nov 1991|volume=46|issue=6|pages=S345-57|pmid=1940101|doi=10.1093/geronj/46.6.s345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Andersen argues need itself is a [[social construct]].  This is why need is split into perceived and evaluated. Where evaluated need represents a more measurable/objective need, perceived need is partly determined by health beliefs, such as whether or not people think their condition is serious enough to seek health services. Another limitation of the model is its emphasis on health care utilization or adopting health outcomes as a dichotomous factor, present or not present. Other help-seeking models also consider the type of help source, including informal sources.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, C. J., Deane, F. P., Ciarrochi, J., &amp; Rickwood, D. (2005). Measuring help-seeking intentions: Properties of the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. Canadian Journal of Counselling, 39(1), 15-28.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work has taken help-seeking behaviors further, and more real-world, by including online and other non-face-to-face sources.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, K. M., McLean, J. P., &amp; Sheffield, J. (2009). Examining suicide-risk individuals who go online for suicide-related purposes. Archives of Suicide Research, 13(3), 264-276. doi: 10.1080/13811110903044419. {{PMID|19591000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Hinterstoisser''' (3 October 1914 – 21 July 1936&lt;ref&gt;Harrer 1998, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a German mountain climber active in the 1930s. He [[1936 Eiger north face climbing disaster|died]] during an attempt to climb the [[Eiger]] north face with his partner [[Toni  Kurz]]. A section of the north face was later named the "Hinterstoisser Traverse" in his honor. The 2008 film ''[[North Face (film)|North Face]]'' was based on his experience climbing the Eiger.

==Biography==
Andreas Hinterstoisser was born on 3 October 1914 in [[Bad Reichenhall]], [[Bavaria]], Germany, where he was raised. He worked in a bank before joining the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' as a professional soldier in 1935. Together with his childhood friend [[Toni Kurz]], he made numerous first ascents of peaks in the [[Berchtesgaden Alps]], including some of the most difficult climbs of that time. The two young men climbed the southwest wall of the [[Berchtesgadener Hochthron]] in 1934, and the south wall of the straight pillar in 1936. They also made first ascents in the [[Reiter Alpe]] on the German–Austrian border, and of the direct southern route up the Watzmannkinder in the [[Watzmann]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Auffermann 2010, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 he formed part of a four-man team making the second attempt to scale the north face of the [[Eiger]]. He was renowned as one of the best [[rock climber]]s of his time and is held in high esteem to this day. He cleverly [[traverse (climbing)|traverse]]d a slab of icy rock, a feat which made the rest of the attempt on the Eiger possible, by climbing up on it and lowering himself to execute a pendulum to the other side, securing a rope and enabling his companions to cross the impassable section. This move became known as the ''Hinterstoisser Traverse''.&lt;ref name="bbcnews"/&gt;

[[File:REI Grab Hinterstoißer.jpg|thumb|upright|Hinterstoisser's grave at Friedhof Bad Reichenhall, Germany]]
During a retreat from the wall, due both to an injury suffered by one of his comrades and to the severe weather, Hinterstoisser could not recross the traverse to safety because the group had previously removed the rope that had helped them across. The group decided to [[abseil]] down the vertical face (the great rock barrier) to the base of the mountain.&lt;ref name="bbcnews"/&gt; Contact was made with a railway guard halfway down the descent during which the climbers called back that everything was all right (perhaps from pride and the knowledge that they were close to safety). However, as Hinterstoisser set up the last stage of the descent an [[avalanche]] came down the mountain, wiping out Hinterstoisser, who had unclipped from the group. He fell to his death and was found at the bottom of the mountain days later. The rest of the group suffered the same fate: [[Willy Angerer]] was killed by the impact; [[Edi Rainer]] was [[asphyxiated]] from the weight of the rope holding his comrades; and [[Toni Kurz]] died from exposure, despite having made contact with rescuers.&lt;ref name="mountainzone"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The tragic story became well known after publication of [[Heinrich Harrer]]'s classic 1960 book ''[[The White Spider]]'' and was more recently covered by [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]'s book (and [[International Emmy Awards|Emmy]]-winning TV documentary), ''[[The Beckoning Silence]]'', as well as the 2008 German dramatic movie ''[[North Face (film)|North Face]]''.&lt;ref name="uk-climbing"/&gt;

'''Brain abscess''' (or '''cerebral abscess''') is an [[abscess]] caused by inflammation and collection of infected material, coming from local (ear infection, [[dental abscess]], infection of [[paranasal sinus]]es, infection of the [[mastoid]] air cells of the temporal bone, [[epidural abscess]]) or remote ([[Human lung|lung]], [[Human heart|heart]], [[kidney]] etc.) infectious sources, within the [[human brain|brain]] tissue. The infection may also be introduced through a skull fracture following a [[head trauma]] or surgical procedures. Brain abscess is usually associated with [[congenital heart disease]] in young children. It may occur at any age but is most frequent in the third decade of life.

==Signs and symptoms==
Fever, headache, and neurological problems, while classic, only occur in 20% of people with brain abscess.&lt;ref name=Br2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brouwer|first1=MC|last2=Coutinho|first2=JM|last3=van de Beek|first3=D|title=Clinical characteristics and outcome of brain abscess: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Neurology|date=Mar 4, 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=806–13|pmid=24477107|doi=10.1212/WNL.0000000000000172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous triad of fever, headache and focal neurologic findings are highly suggestive of brain abscess. These symptoms are caused by a combination of increased [[intracranial pressure]] due to a space-occupying lesion (headache, vomiting, confusion, [[coma]]), infection (fever, fatigue etc.) and focal neurologic brain tissue damage ([[hemiparesis]], [[aphasia]] etc.). 

The most frequent presenting symptoms are headache, drowsiness, [[mental confusion|confusion]], [[seizure]]s, hemiparesis or speech difficulties together with fever with a rapidly progressive course. Headache is characteristically worse at night and in the morning, as the intracranial pressure naturally increases when in the [[supine]] position. This elevation similarly stimulates the medullary vomiting center and [[area postrema]], leading to morning vomiting. 

Other symptoms and findings depend largely on the specific location of the abscess in the brain. An abscess in the cerebellum, for instance, may cause additional complaints as a result of [[brain stem]] compression and [[hydrocephalus]]. [[Neurological examination]] may reveal a stiff neck in occasional cases (erroneously suggesting meningitis).

==Pathophysiology==

===Bacterial===
[[File:Brain MRI 131749 rgbca-.png|thumb|Brain abscess after metastasis treatment.]]
Anaerobic and microaerophilic cocci and gram-negative and gram-positive [[anaerobic infection|anaerobic]] bacilli are the predominate bacterial [[Isolation (microbiology)|isolate]]s. Many brain abscesses are polymicrobical. The predominant organisms include: ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', aerobic and anaerobic streptococci (especially ''[[Streptococcus intermedius]]''), ''[[Bacteroides]]'', ''[[Prevotella]]'', and ''[[Fusobacterium]]'' species, Enterobacteriaceae, ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' species, and other anaerobes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brook I |title=Microbiology and antimicrobial treatment of orbital and intracranial complications of sinusitis in children and their management |journal=Int. J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. |volume=73 |issue=9 |pages=1183–6 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19249108 |doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2009.01.020 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165-5876(09)00062-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less common organisms include: ''Haemophillus influenzae'', ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' and ''Neisseria meningitides''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brook I |title=Brain abscess in children: microbiology and management |journal=J. Child Neurol. |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=283–8 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7594262 |url=http://jcn.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7594262 |doi=10.1177/088307389501000405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacterial abscesses rarely (if ever) arise ''de novo'' within the brain, although establishing a cause can be difficult in many cases.  There is almost always a primary lesion elsewhere in the body that must be sought assiduously, because failure to treat the primary lesion will result in relapse.  In cases of trauma, for example in compound skull fractures where fragments of bone are pushed into the substance of the brain, the cause of the abscess is obvious.  Similarly, bullets and other foreign bodies may become sources of infection if left in place.  The location of the primary lesion may be suggested by the location of the abscess: infections of the middle ear result in lesions in the [[middle cranial fossa|middle]] and [[posterior cranial fossa|posterior]] cranial fossae;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Macewan W | year=1893 | title=Pyogenic Infective Diseases of the Brain and Spinal Cord | location=Glasgow | publisher=James Maclehose and Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt; congenital heart disease with right-to-left shunts often result in abscesses in the distribution of the [[middle cerebral artery]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ingraham FD, Matson DD | title=Neurosurgery of Infancy andChildhood | location=Springfield, Ill | publisher=Charles C Thomas | year=1954 | pages=377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raimondi AJ, Matsumoto S, Miller RA | title=Brain abscess in children with congenital heart disease | journal=J Neurosurg | volume=23 | pages=588–95 | year=1965 | doi=10.3171/jns.1965.23.6.0588 | pmid=5861142 | issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and infection of the [[frontal sinus|frontal]] and [[ethmoid sinus|ethmoid]] sinuses usually results in collection in the subdural sinuses.

=== Other organisms ===
[[fungus|Fungi]] and [[parasite]]s may also cause the disease. Fungi and parasites are especially associated with immunocompromised patients. Other causes include: ''[[Nocardia asteroides]]'', ''Mycobacterium'', Fungi (e.g. ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'', ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'', ''Mucorales'', ''Coccidioides'', ''[[Histoplasma capsulatum]]'', ''[[Blastomyces dermatitidis]]'', ''Bipolaris'', ''[[Exophiala dermatitidis]]'', ''[[Curvularia pallescens]]'', ''Ochroconis gallopava'', ''Ramichloridium mackenziei'', ''[[Pseudallescheria boydii]]''), Protozoa (e.g. ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', ''[[Schistosoma]]'', ''Paragonimus''), and Helminths (e.g. ''Taenia solium''). Organisms that are most frequently associated with brain abscess in patients with [[AIDS]] are [[poliovirus]], ''Toxoplasma gondii'', and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', though in infection with the latter organism, symptoms of [[meningitis]] generally predominate.

These organisms are associated with certain predisposing conditions: 
*Sinus and dental infections—Aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g. ''Prevotella'', ''Porphyromonas'', ''Bacteroides''), ''Fusobacterium'', ''S. aureus'', and Enterobacteriaceae
*Penetrating trauma—''S. aureus'', aerobic streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and ''Clostridium'' spp.
*Pulmonary infections—Aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (e.g. ''Prevotella'', ''Porphyromonas'', ''Bacteroides''), ''Fusobacterium'', ''Actinomyces'', and ''Nocardia''
*Congenital heart disease—Aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, and ''S. aureus''
*HIV infection—''T. gondii'', ''Mycobacterium'', ''Nocardia'', ''Cryptococcus'', and ''Listeria monocytogenes''
*Transplantation—''Aspergillus'', ''Candida'', ''Cryptococcus'', ''Mucorales'', ''Nocardia'', and ''T. gondii''
*Neutropenia—Aerobic gram-negative bacilli, ''Aspergillus'', ''Candida'', and ''Mucorales''

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Brain Abscess at MRI (T1 + contrast) -- showing a small ring-enhancing lesion with mild surrounding edema adjacent to the ventricular catheter and ventricular dilatation..jpg|thumb|MRI (T1 with contrast) showing the ring-enhancing lesion. From a rare case report of an abscess formed as a complication of the CSF shunt. Jamjoom et al., 2009.&lt;ref name="jamjoom09"/&gt;]]
The diagnosis is established by a [[computed tomography]] (CT) (with contrast) examination. At the initial phase of the inflammation (which is referred to as [[cerebrit]]is), the immature lesion does not have a capsule and it may be difficult to distinguish it from other space-occupying lesions or infarcts of the brain.  Within 4–5 days the inflammation and the concomitant dead brain tissue are surrounded with a capsule, which gives the lesion the famous [[ring-enhancing lesion]] appearance on CT examination with contrast (since intravenously applied contrast material can not pass through the capsule, it is collected around the lesion and looks as a ring surrounding the relatively dark lesion). [[Lumbar puncture]] procedure, which is performed in many infectious disorders of the central nervous system is contraindicated in this condition (as it is in all space-occupying lesions of the brain) because removing a certain portion of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] may alter the concrete intracranial pressure balances and causes the brain tissue to move across structures within the skull ([[brain herniation]]).

Ring enhancement may also be observed in cerebral hemorrhages (bleeding) and some brain [[tumor]]s. However, in the presence of the rapidly progressive course with fever, focal neurologic findings (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.) and signs of increased intracranial pressure, the most likely diagnosis should be the brain abscess.

==Treatment==
The treatment includes lowering the increased intracranial pressure and starting intravenous [[antibiotic]]s (and meanwhile identifying the causative organism mainly by blood culture studies).

[[Hyperbaric medicine|Hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBO2 or HBOT) is indicated as a primary and adjunct treatment which provides four primary functions.
Firstly, HBOT reduces intracranial pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://membership.uhms.org/?page=IA|title=Home - Undersea &amp; Hyperbaric Medical Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, high partial pressures of oxygen act as a bactericide and thus inhibits the anaerobic and functionally anaerobic flora common in brain abscess. Third, HBOT optimizes the immune function thus enhancing the host defense mechanisms and fourth, HBOT has been found to be of benefit when brain abscess is concomitant with cranial osteomyleitis.

Secondary functions of HBOT include increased stem cell production and up-regulation of VEGF which aid in the healing and recovery process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/content/ajpheart/290/4/H1378.full.pdf|title=Stem cell mobilization by hyperbaric oxygen|first1=Stephen R.|last1=Thom|first2=Veena M.|last2=Bhopale|first3=Omaida C.|last3=Velazquez|first4=Lee J.|last4=Goldstein|first5=Lynne H.|last5=Thom|first6=Donald G.|last6=Buerk|date=1 April 2006|publisher=|journal=Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol.|volume=290|issue=4|pages=H1378–1386|doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00888.2005|pmid=16299259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgical drainage of the abscess remains part of the standard management of bacterial brain abscesses.  The location and treatment of the primary lesion also crucial, as is the removal of any foreign material (bone, dirt, bullets, and so forth).

There are few exceptions to this rule: ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' meningitis is often associated with subdural effusions that are mistaken for subdural empyemas.  These effusions resolve with antibiotics and require no surgical treatment.  [[Tuberculosis]] can produce brain abscesses that look identical to conventional bacterial abscesses on CT imaging. Surgical drainage or aspiration is often necessary to identify ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', but once the diagnosis is made no further surgical intervention is necessary.

CT guided stereotactic aspiration is also indicated in the treatment of brain abscess. The use of pre-operative imaging, intervention with post-operative clinical and biochemical monitoring used to manage brain abscesses today dates back to the Pennybacker system pioneered by [[Somerset, Kentucky]]-born neurosurgeon Joseph Buford Pennybacker, director of the neurosurgery department of the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]], [[Oxford]] from 1952 to 1971. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28185969  ''Joseph Buford Pennybacker, C.B.E., M.D., F.R.C.S. (1907-1983): Continuing Sir Hugh Cairns' Oxford Legacy and Pioneer of the Modern Management of Cerebral Abscesses'', August 2017, Ravindran Visagan, Harold Ellis, World Neurosurgery, Amsterdam].Retrieved 6 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Prognosis==
While death occurs in about 10% of cases, people do well about 70% of the time.&lt;ref name=Br2014/&gt; This is a large improvement from the 1960s due to improved ability to image the head, better neurosurgery and better antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Br2014/&gt;

The plate is then placed into a non-CO2 [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]] and heated at thirty-five degrees [[Celsius]] for sixteen to twenty hours. Following the allotted time, the plate is removed and checked for bacterial growth. If the broth became cloudy or a layer of cells formed at the bottom, then bacterial growth has occurred. The results of the broth microdilution method are reported in Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), or the lowest concentration of antibiotics that stopped bacterial expansion.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

==Advantages==
The broth microdilution method can be used to test the susceptibility of bacteria to multiple antibiotics at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Mary|title=Basic Skills in Interpreting Laboratory Data|date=2013|publisher=ASHP|page=723|edition=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WW1AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT723&amp;dq=broth-microdilution+method&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2yZoVKmsK8uCsQSTroGQDw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=broth-microdilution%20method&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broth microdilution is also highly accurate. The accuracy of its results are comparable to [[agar dilution]], the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of susceptibility testing. Other advantages include the commercial availability of plates, the ease of testing and storing the plates, and the ability for the results of some tests to be read by machines.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

The '''Cystic Fibrosis Foundation''' ('''CFF''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] in the [[United States]] established to provide the means to cure and control [[cystic fibrosis]] (CF). The Foundation provides information about cystic fibrosis and finances CF research that aims to improve the quality of life for people with the disease. The Foundation also engages in legislative lobbying for cystic fibrosis.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.cff.org/aboutCFFoundation/| title =About the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation| publisher =Cystic Fibrosis Foundation| accessdate =2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Foundation was established in 1955 by a group of volunteers in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

In addition to providing [[Grant (money)|grants]] for research into cystic fibrosis and supporting clinical trials, the foundation promotes and accredits 115 specialized centers for treatment of individuals with cystic fibrosis. The Foundation has over 80 chapters and offices across the United States.

Before it began using the current name, the organization was known as the "National Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation".&lt;ref name= formername&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_6023020 Dorothy H. Andersen papers, 1930-1965], Columbia University Libraries, no date.  Retrieved January 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, scientists working for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation discovered the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, considered the key to developing a cure for cystic fibrosis.

From 1982 until 1999, sports journalist [[Frank Deford]] served as [[chairman]] of the Foundation.

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has been a pioneer of cystic fibrosis treatment, having played a major role in the development and use of five FDA-approved therapies, including [[ivacaftor]] (Kalydeco).&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

In 2014, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation sold the rights to the royalties of the drugs for $3.3 billion, twenty times the Foundation’s 2013 budget.&lt;ref name="NYT_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=Deal by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Raises Cash and Some Concern |author=Andrew Pollack |date=November 19, 2014 |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |publisher=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/business/for-cystic-fibrosis-foundation-venture-yields-windfall-in-hope-and-cash.html?_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{citation |title=Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Sells Drug’s Rights for $3.3 Billion: The Biggest Royalty Purchase Ever Reflects Group’s Share of Kalydeco Sales |author1=Joseph Walker |author2=Jonathan D.

==Present day==

Currently the Foundation operates out of Bethesda, Maryland.  Preston Campbell, M.D. is the active president and CEO of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cff.org/aboutCFFoundation/PresidentMessage/ |title=Message from the President |deadurl=no |publisher=Cystic Fibrosis Foundation |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
The Foundation hosts several philanthropic events both locally around the chapters and nationwide. One of the biggest signature events is the Great Strides walk, established in 1989.It is a sponsored walk akin to [[Race for the Cure]], where participants walk {{convert|10|km|mi|sp=us}} to raise money to support research for cystic fibrosis. There are Great Strides walks in over 560 locations throughout the country.Great Strides has succeeded in raising over $180,000,000 for cystic fibrosis research. 

Some other signature events include the CF Cycle for Life, CF Climb, Xtreme Hike, and Team CF. The list of national events includes Ultimate Golf Experience, [[American Airlines]] Celebrity Ski, and Volunteer Leadership Conference. Individual chapters may host their own events which may include, but are not limited to, fishing events, dinner dance events, golf tournaments, and finest events. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cff.org/Take-Action/Events/|title=Participate in an Event {{!}} CF Foundation|website=www.cff.org|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the tissue-weighted sum of the [[equivalent dose]]s in all specified tissues and organs of the human body and represents the [[stochastic]] health risk to the whole body, which is the ''probability'' of [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer induction]] and genetic effects, of low levels of [[ionising radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt; It takes into account the type of radiation and the nature of each organ or tissue being irradiated, and enables summation of organ doses due to varying levels and types of radiation, both internal and external, to produce an overall calculated effective dose.

The SI unit for effective dose is the [[sievert]] (Sv) which represents a 5.5% chance of developing cancer.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103&lt;/ref&gt; The effective dose is not intended as a measure of ''deterministic'' health effects, which is the ''severity'' of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, that is measured by the quantity [[absorbed dose]].&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of effective dose was developed by Wolfgang Jacobi and published in 1975, and was so convincing that the ICRP incorporated it into their 1977 general recommendations (publication 26) as "effective dose equivalent".&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; The name "effective dose" replaced the name "effective dose equivalent" in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 executive summary para 101&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1977 it has been the central quantity for dose limitation in the ICRP international system of [[radiation protection|radiological protection]].&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication, 103 para 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry]]
According to the ICRP, the main uses of effective dose are the prospective dose assessment for planning and optimisation in radiological protection, and demonstration of compliance with dose limits for regulatory purposes. The effective dose is thus a central dose quantity for regulatory purposes.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 executive summary para j&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRP also says that effective dose has made a significant contribution to radiological protection as it has enabled doses to be summed from whole and partial body exposure from external radiation of various types and from intakes of radionuclides.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 para 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage for external dose===
The calculation of effective dose is required for partial or non-uniform irradiation of the human body because [[equivalent dose]] does not consider the tissue irradiated, but only the radiation type. Various body tissues react to ionising radiation in different ways, so the ICRP has assigned sensitivity factors to specified tissues and organs so that the effect of partial irradiation can be calculated if the irradiated regions are known.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, para 22 &amp; glossary&lt;/ref&gt;  A radiation field irradiating only a portion of the body will carry lower risk than if the same field irradiated the whole body. To take this into account, the effective doses to the component parts of the body which have been irradiated are calculated and summed. This becomes the effective dose for the whole body, dose quantity ''E''. It is a "protection" dose quantity which can be calculated, but cannot be measured in practice.

An effective dose will carry the same effective risk to the whole body regardless of where it was applied, and it will carry the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body.

===Usage for internal dose===
Effective dose can be calculated for [[committed dose]] which is the internal dose resulting from inhaling, ingesting, or injecting radioactive materials. 

The dose quantity used is:

'''Committed effective dose,''' E(''t'') is the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''t'' is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Glossary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of effective dose==
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationships of protection dose quantities in [[SI]] units]]
Ionizing radiation deposits energy in the matter being irradiated. The quantity used to express this is the [[absorbed dose]], a physical dose quantity that is dependent on the level of incident radiation and the absorption properties of the irradiated object. Absorbed dose is a physical quantity, and is not a satisfactory indicator of biological effect, so to allow consideration of the stochastic radiological risk, the dose quantities equivalent dose and effective dose were devised by the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) and the ICRP to calculate the biological effect of an absorbed dose.

To obtain an effective dose, the calculated absorbed organ dose ''D''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is first corrected for the radiation type using factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; to give a weighted average of the equivalent dose quantity ''H''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; received in irradiated body tissues, and the result is further corrected for the tissues or organs being irradiated using factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, to produce the effective dose quantity ''E''.

The sum of effective doses to all organs and tissues of the body represents the effective dose for the whole body. If only part of the body is irradiated, then only those regions are used to calculate the effective dose. The tissue weighting factors summate to 1.0, so that if an entire body is radiated with uniformly penetrating external radiation, the effective dose for the entire body is equal to the equivalent dose for the entire body.

===Use of tissue weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;===
The ICRP tissue weighting factors are given in the accompanying table, and the equations used to calculate from either absorbed dose or equivalent dose are also given.

Some tissues like bone marrow are particularly sensitive to radiation, so they are given a weighting factor that is disproportionally large relative to the fraction of body mass they represent. Other tissues like the hard bone surface are particularly insensitive to radiation and are assigned a disproportionally low weighting factor.

Calculating from the equivalent dose:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_T W_T \cdot H_T = \sum_T W_T \sum_R W_R \cdot \bar{D}_{T,R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Calculating from the absorbed dose:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_T W_T \sum_R W_R \cdot \frac{\int_{T}D_R (x,y,z)\rho(x,y,z)dV}{\int_{T}\rho(x,y,z)dV}&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;  is the effective dose to the entire organism
:&lt;math&gt;H_T&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent dose absorbed by tissue T
:&lt;math&gt;W_T&lt;/math&gt; is the tissue weighting factor defined by regulation
:&lt;math&gt;W_R&lt;/math&gt; is the radiation weighting factor defined by regulation
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{D}_{T,R}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass-averaged absorbed dose in tissue T by radiation type R
:&lt;math&gt;D_R (x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the absorbed dose from radiation type R as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the density as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;  is volume
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;  is the tissue or organ of interest

The ICRP tissue weighting factors are chosen to represent the fraction of health risk, or biological effect, which is attributable to the specific tissue named. These weighting factors have been revised twice, as shown in the chart above.

The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] still endorses the ICRP's 1977 tissue weighting factors in their regulations, in spite of the ICRP's later revised recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1003|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1003.html|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By medical imaging type==
{{Effective dose by medical imaging type}}

==Health effects==
{{Main|Radiobiology}}
Ionizing radiation is generally harmful and potentially lethal to living things but can have health benefits in [[radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer and [[thyrotoxicosis]]. Its most common impact is the [[radiation-induced cancer|induction of cancer]] with a [[Incubation period|latent period]] of years or decades after exposure. High doses can cause visually dramatic [[radiation burns]], and/or rapid fatality through [[acute radiation syndrome]]. Controlled doses are used for [[medical imaging]] and [[radiotherapy]]. 

==Regulatory nomenclature==
===UK regulations===
The UK [[Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999]] defines its usage of the term effective dose; "Any reference to an effective dose means the sum of the effective dose to the whole body from external radiation and the committed effective dose from internal radiation."&lt;ref&gt;The UK Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 &lt;/ref&gt;

===US effective dose equivalent===
The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has retained in the US regulation system the older term '''effective dose equivalent''' to refer to a similar quantity to the ICRP effective dose. The NRC's [[total effective dose equivalent]] (TEDE) is the sum of external effective dose with internal committed dose; in other words all sources of dose.

In the US, cumulative equivalent dose due to external whole-body exposure is normally reported to nuclear energy workers in regular dosimetry reports.

* [[deep-dose equivalent]], (DDE) which is properly a whole-body equivalent dose
* '''shallow dose equivalent''', (SDE) which is actually the effective dose to the skin

==History==
The concept of effective dose was introduced in 1975 by Wolfgang Jacobi (1928–2015) in his publication "The concept of an effective dose: a proposal for the combination of organ doses".&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;Journal of Radiological protection Vol.35 No.3 2015. "Obituary - Wolfgang Jacobi 1928 - 2015."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacobi W|title=The concept of effective dose - A proposal for the combination of organ doses|journal=Radiat. Environ. Biophys|year=1975|issue=12|pages=101–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly included in 1977 as “effective dose equivalent” into Publication 26 by the ICRP. In 1991, ICRP publication 60 shortened the name to "effective dose."&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 paragraph 101&lt;/ref&gt; This quantity is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "dose equivalent" because of the earlier name, and that misnomer in turn causes confusion with [[equivalent dose]]. The tissue weighting factors were revised in 1990 and 2007 due to new data.

==Future use of Effective Dose==
At the ICRP 3rd International Symposium on the System of Radiological Protection in October 2015, ICRP Task Group 79 reported on the "Use of Effective Dose as a Risk-related Radiological Protection Quantity".

This included a proposal to discontinue use of equivalent dose as a separate protection quantity. This would avoid confusion between equivalent dose, effective dose and dose equivalent, and to use absorbed dose in Gy as a more appropriate quantity for limiting deterministic effects to the eye lens, skin, hands &amp; feet.&lt;ref&gt;"Use of Effective Dose", John Harrison. 3rd International Symposium on the System of Radiological Protection, October 2015, Seoul.  &lt;/ref&gt;

It was also proposed that effective dose could be used as a rough indicator of possible risk from medical examinations. These proposals will need to go through the following stages:

* Discussion within ICRP Committees
* Revision of report by Task Group
* Reconsideration by Committees and Main Commission
* Public Consultation

'''Emerson Colon Angell''' (1822-1903) was an American Dentist who is known as the father of the rapid maxillary expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timms|first=D.

==Life==
He was born and grew up in [[Scituate, Rhode Island]]. He was the 7th generation of his family from Rhode Island. He was descendant of [[Thomas Angell]]. Emerson learned agriculture and mechanics from his father. He began studying dentistry in 1846 under mentorship of people in the community due to the lack of any formal education available at that time. He eventually practiced in Rhode Island, New York City and San Francisco.

==Dentistry==
Emerson first published a paper on expansion of palate in [[San Francisco Medical Press]] (SFMP) in January 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirsch|first=G. P.|date=1977-06-01|title=Palatal expansion - adjunct to dentofacial orthopedics|journal=International Journal of Orthodontics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=23–29, 46|issn=0020-7500|pmid=328420}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initial paper described the expansion of palate with deciduous teeth which was later followed by another paper on the permanent teeth dentition in SFMP. His first paper was a case report which focused on a 14-year-old patient with a posterior [[Crossbite]]. Emerson fitted this patient with an appliance in his maxillary arch and gave patients instructions to turn screw everyday. Emerson claimed that expansion was achieved in 2 weeks by separation of maxilla along the [[Midpalatal suture]] . Dr. Angell faced much criticism from people in the field of dentistry at that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philippe|first=Julien|date=2007-04-01|title=The origin of treatment expansion|journal=American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics|volume=131|issue=4|pages=446; author reply 446|doi=10.1016/j.ajodo.2007.02.044|issn=1097-6752|pmid=17418705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''European Forum of Medical Associations''' ('''EFMA''') is an international organisation with an aim to establish dialogue and cooperation between National Medical Associations (NMAs) and [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] in the European Region to improve the quality of health and health care in Europe; promote the exchange of information and ideas between NMAs and WHO; integrate appropriate aspects of policies for health for all into basic, postgraduate and [[continuing medical education]]; and as appropriate formulate consensus policy statements on health issues.

==History and development==
The dialogue between national medical associations and the WHO began in December 1984 with a meeting of western European national medical associations and WHO in [[Copenhagen]]. At this time, it was recognized that clearly the medical profession had an important role to play if the philosophy of the [[Health For All|Health For All (HFA)]] movement in general and the European regional HFA targets in particular were to be achieved. Further meetings involving national medical associations, both from the West and East, took place in 1986, 1987 and 1988. At a meeting in [[Rome]] in 1990, the national medical associations recognised that they had created a permanent forum permitting a fruitful dialogue with WHO. This was formalized at [[Helsinki]] in 1991 when the aims of the Forum were finalized as follows:

"The aims of the Forum shall be, by establishing a dialogue and cooperation between National Medical Associations and the WHO Regional Office for the European Region, to:

a) improve the quality of health and health care in Europe;
b) promote the exchange of information and ideas between national medical associations, and between the associations and the World Health Organization;
c) integrate appropriate aspects of policies of Health for All into basic, postgraduate and continuing medical education; and
d) formulate consensus policy statements on health issues."

For the purposes of membership, a national medical association is defined as a free independent nongovernmental association of physicians constituted in an organization, which elect its own officers, appoints its own staff and determines its own constitution, except for any statutory duties that it undertakes, and whose activities cover all the various aspects of professional practice.

With the changes in the eastern part of the region during the 1990s, there was a need for special dialogue between the countries of the east of the region and those in the west. In [[Budapest]] (1994), [[London]] (1995) and [[Stockholm]] (1996) post-Forum meetings were held for the benefit of the newly emerging and re-establishing national medical associations from this part of the region. In 1997, this was merged with the main meeting and devoted to a discussion on health care reform, based on the 1996 WHO Ljubljana Charter on Reforming Health Care.

In the annual meetings of the Forum,  representatives from medical associations in around 40 countries are represented. Observers have included the Canadian Medical Association, which has attended regularly, and a number of Pan-European medical associations.

Each year, national medical associations report not only on their general activities but also on any action they have taken in areas which the Forum has considered. A handbook is updated annually containing information about the constitution, activities and officers of participating national medical associations.

From the beginning, the problems of tobacco and smoking and the subject of continuing medical education have been subjects of continuing report and action and, starting in [[Sofia]] in 1988, the quality of care. The meetings have considered a spectrum of subjects including [[AIDS]], new patterns of [[infectious diseases]], health care in the elderly, health promotion, the rights of patients, the physician’s role in [[environmental health]], financing of health care, development of new health care systems, [[suicide|suicide in the young]], quality of care development, use/misuse/abuse of drugs, [[medical education]], health care in prisons, and [[eHealth]].

Over the years, the Forum has adopted a number of declarations, statements and recommendations. Some of these statements have been followed up by establishing action groups, notably in relation to tobacco and to the quality of care, in order to assist national medical associations in carrying forward appropriate action in their own countries.

==Annual meetings==
A meeting of the Forum is organized once a year (normally March or April), to review developments relevant to the medical profession and to exchange experience.

In 2006, the meeting was held in [[Budapest]], hosted by the [[Hungarian Medical Association]], and in 2007 in [[Lisbon]], hosted by the [[Portuguese Medical Association]]. On 7 September 2007, EFMA Liaison Committee took place in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]], hosted by the [[Armenian Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;http://moked.it/ame/files/2009/11/ima_news_gennaio08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The annual meeting in 2008 took place in [[Israel]] on 10–11 April 2008 and was hosted by the [[Israel Medical Association]]. In 2012, EFMA meeting was hosted by the [[Armenian Medical Association]] and took place on 19–20 April 2012 in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. In addition to Health 2020, the financial crisis, social determinants of health and policies on alcohol were on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/en/who-we-are/regional-director/news/news/2012/02/whoeurope-and-the-european-forum-of-medical-associations-efma-prepare-for-next-meeting&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants at the annual meetings comprise representatives from the various medical associations, as well as observers from other associations and organizations in Europe e.g. the World Medical Association (WMA), the [[Standing Committee of European Doctors, Comité permanent des médecins européens]] (CPME), [[Permanent Working Group of European Junior Doctors]] (PWG), [[European Union of General Practitioners]] (UEMO), [[European Medical Students' Association]] (EMSA), [[European Working Group of Practitioners and Specialists in Free Practice]] (E.A.N.A.), [[European Federation of Salaried Doctors]] (FEMS), [[European Association of Senior Hospital Physicians]] (A.E.M.H.).

In the occupation years as the French dealt with their humiliating defeat and surrender, the morality of sex in the Vichy occupation changed.  In his book ''1940–1945, The Erotic Years: Vichy, or, the Misfortunes of Virtue'' Patrick Buisson talks about “erotic shock ... or exploring new territories of pleasure."&lt;ref name="frenchpubagency.com"/&gt; After the occupation he writes about French prisoners bedding local German girls, while back in their homeland French women had intimate relations with their German occupiers.  Local cinemas and even subway stations became anonymous locations for physical trysts during Allied bombings.&lt;ref name="frenchpubagency.com"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= 2012 |url = http://frenchpubagency.com/Title-199753-History/1940%E2%80%931945-Annees-erotiques-Vichy-ou-les-infortunes-de-la-vertu.html|title = 1940–1945, The Erotic Years: Vichy, or, the Misfortunes of Virtue|format = |publisher = frenchpubagency.com| accessdate = December 11, 2012 | last=frenchpubagency.com| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Allied liberation any woman who had a reputation for associating with the Germans were targeted as collaborators and [[Pursuit_of_Nazi_collaborators#France|faced hazing or worse]].

==Germany==

The German birth rate, like that in most industrial nations, had been falling for decades.  When [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] took power in 1933 they implemented several revolutionary policies in order to change the sexual practices of the German people and reverse this slide in birth rates.  At the same time that it forbade the mixing of Jewish and German through the [[Nuremberg Laws]], the Nazi government tried a number of policies designed to increase new births.  One action was to change the marriage laws via the 1938 divorce-reform law by the Minister of Justice, [[Franz Gürtner]].&lt;ref name= "Grunberger p. 10"&gt;{{harvnb|Grunberger|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within two years 30,000 divorces were filed, 80% of which were husbands casting off women over 45 years old.&lt;ref name= "Grunberger p. 11"&gt;{{harvnb|Grunberger|2005|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the divorce law increased new marriages and children from these marriages, the Nazis looked to illegitimate births in Germany as a way to increase Germany's birthrate.&lt;ref name= "Grunberger p. 11"/&gt;

In the 1920s there were about 150,000 illegitimate births in Germany, before halving during the depression and bouncing up to 100,000 in 1935.&lt;ref name= "Grunberger p. 11"/&gt;  The Nazis wanted to increase the illegitimate births by encouraging out of wedlock births, especially those of Aryan heritage.  Part official policy, part propaganda, the Nazi policy manifested itself in the [[Lebensborn|Lebensborn program]].  The Lebensborn program provided a place where pregnant mothers could have their babies out of wedlock in secret.&lt;ref name= "Crossland p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Crossland|2006|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-062A-58, "Verein Lebensborn", Taufe.jpg|thumb|alt=SS soldiers standing while a crowd is seated with one woman holding a child|Christening of a Lebensborn child]]
Only the most "pure" of its applicants were chosen to join its programs.  Of all the women who applied, only 40 percent passed the racial purity test (they had to show their family tree three generations back) and were granted admission to the Lebensborn program. The majority of mothers were unmarried, 57.6 percent until 1939, and about 70 percent by 1940.&lt;ref name= "Jewish Virtual Library p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Jewish Virtual Library|2010|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lebensborn program was given a further push when [[Himmler]] issued a proclamation that every SS soldier should father a child before he left for war.  The child could then be born and raised at the Lebensborn facilities.&lt;ref name= "Grunberger p. 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Grunberger|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through these policies the birth rate increased and Himmler told his doctor Kerstern how proud he was to have a role in the change, "Only a few years ago illegitimate children were considered a shameful matter ... [now] my men tell me with shining eyes that a son has been born to them.  Their girls consider it an honour, not a source of shame."  

Once [[World War II]] broke out and men were sent to the front, the Nazis changed their promise of "every woman will have a man" to "every woman will have a child".  A report to the Ministry of Justice in 1944 stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Leaders of the [League of German Girls have] intimated to their girls that they should bear illegitimate children; these leaders have pointed out that in view of the prevailing shortage of men, not every girl could expect to get a husband in future, and that the girls should at least fulfil their task as German women and donate a child to the [[Führer]].&lt;ref name= "Grunberger p. 14"&gt;{{harvnb|Grunberger|2005|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a mark of how much sexual attitudes had changed by the end of the war, 23% of all young Germans were infected with a venereal disease, and prostitution had quadrupled, including male and female prostitution, as the allies were many times more willing to have sexual relations with a male who could not get pregnant.  A number of scandals including males caught naked/sexually involved caused some of the male prostitutes to be shipped to smaller towns or islands, where they were the majority of men there and they caused many families to breakup, given their peculiar proclivity to maintain a strong sexual identity with males they had found in smaller towns.&lt;ref name= "Grunberger p. 15"&gt;{{harvnb|Grunberger|2005|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, this was the consequence of rape by Allied soldiers or the harsh living conditions which drove huge numbers of starving Germans into prostitution just to survive.{{cite needed|date=April 2018}}

Had the Germans triumphed, Himmler and Bormann were considering a post-war institution of double marriage for Nazi party officials and war heroes.&lt;ref name= "Grunberger p. 15"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18547">'''Experiential avoidance''' ('''EA''') has been broadly defined as attempts to avoid thoughts, feelings, memories, physical sensations, and other internal experiences—even when doing so creates harm in the long-run.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hayes |first1=S. C. |last2=Strosahl |first2=K. D. |last3=Wilson |first3=K. G. |year=1999 |title=Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: An Experiential Approach to Behavior Change |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of EA is thought to be maintained through [[Negative reinforcement#Positive and negative reinforcement|negative reinforcement]]—that is, short-term relief of discomfort is achieved through avoidance, thereby increasing the likelihood that the behavior will persist.  Importantly, the current conceptualization of EA suggests that it is not negative thoughts, emotions, and sensations that are problematic, but how one responds to them that can cause difficulties.  In particular, a habitual and persistent unwillingness to experience uncomfortable thoughts and feelings (and the associated avoidance and inhibition of these experiences) is thought to be linked to a wide range of problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.64.6.1152 |title=Experiential avoidance and behavioral disorders: A functional dimensional approach to diagnosis and treatment |year=1996 |last1=Hayes |first1=Steven C. |last2=Wilson |first2=Kelly G. |last3=Gifford |first3=Elizabeth V. |last4=Follette |first4=Victoria M. |last5=Strosahl |first5=Kirk |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=1152–68 |pmid=8991302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

EA has been popularized by recent [[Behavior therapy#Third generation|third-wave cognitive-behavioral]] theories such as [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT). However, the general concept has roots in many other theories of psychopathology and intervention.

=== Psychodynamic ===
[[Defense mechanisms]] were originally conceptualized as ways to avoid unpleasant affect and discomfort that resulted from conflicting motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freud |first1=A.  |year=1966 |title=The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense |location=New York |publisher=International Universities Press}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These processes were thought to contribute to the expression of various types of psychopathology.  Gradual removal of these defensive processes are thought to be a key aspect of treatment and eventually return to psychological health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karon |first1=B. P. |last2=Widener |first2=A. J. |year=1995 |editor1-first=B. |editor1-last=Bongar |editor2-first=L. E. |editor2-last=Beutler |title=Comprehensive Textbook of Psychotherapy |pages=24–47 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process-experiential ===
[[Process-experiential therapy]] merges [[Person-centered therapy|client-centered]], [[Existential therapy|existential]], and [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt]] approaches.&lt;ref name="GreenbergWatson1998"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Leslie S. |last1=Greenberg |first2=Jeanne C. |last2=Watson |first3=Germain |last3=Lietaer |title=Handbook of Experiential Psychotherapy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b1i3QJYjj_kC&amp;pg=PA6 |accessdate=15 September 2013 |year=1998 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-374-4 |pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gestalt theory outlines the benefits of being fully aware of and open to one's entire experience.  One job of the psychotherapist is to "explore and become fully aware of [the patient's] grounds for avoidance" and to "[lead] the patient back to that which he wishes to avoid" (p.&amp;nbsp;142).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perls |first1=F. S. |last2=Hefferline |first2=R. F. |last3=Goodman |first3=P. |year=1951 |title=Gestalt Therapy: Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality |location=New York |publisher=Julian Press}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar ideas are expressed by early [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] theory: "Whether the stimulus was the impact of a configuration of form, color, or sound in the environment on the sensory nerves, or a memory trace from the past, or a visceral sensation of fear or pleasure or disgust, the person would be 'living' it, would have it completely available to awareness…he is more open to his feelings of fear and discouragement and pain...he is more able fully to live the experiences of his organism rather than shutting them out of awareness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=C. R. |year=1961 |title=On Becoming a Person: A Therapist's View of Psychotherapy |location=Houghton Boston |publisher=Mifflin Company |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral ===
Traditional [[Behavior therapy#Third generation|behavior therapy]] utilizes exposure to habituate the patient to various types of fears and anxieties,&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barlow |first1=D. H. |year=1988 |title=Anxiety and its Disorders |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craighead |first1=W. E. |last2=Craighead |first2=L. W. |last3=Ilardi |first3=S. S. |year=1995 |chapter=Behavior therapies in historical  perspective |editor1-first=B. |editor1-last=Bongar |editor2-first=L. E. |editor2-last=Beutler |title=Comprehensive Textbook of Psychotherapy |pages=64–83 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually resulting in a marked reduction in psychopathology.  In this way, exposure can be thought of as "counter-acting" avoidance, in that it involves individuals repeatedly encountering and remaining in contact with that which causes distress and discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0029789 |title=Extinction of avoidance responding through response prevention (flooding) |year=1970 |last1=Baum |first1=Morrie |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=276–84 |pmid=5479591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive ===
In [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive theory]], avoidance interferes with reappraisals of negative thought patterns and schema, thereby perpetuating distorted beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=D. M. |year=1988 |chapter=A cognitive model of panic |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=Rachman |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Maser |title=Panic: Psychological Perspectives |location=Hillsdale |publisher=Erlbaum}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These distorted beliefs are thought to contribute and maintain many types of psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beck |first1=A. T. |year=1976 |title=Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders |location=Madison, CT |publisher=International Universities Press}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-wave cognitive-behavioral ===
The concept of EA is explicitly described and targeted in more recent [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]] modalities including acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[functional analytic psychotherapy]] (FAP), and [[behavioral activation]] (BA).

== Associated problems ==

* Distress is an inextricable part of life; therefore, avoidance is often only a temporary solution.
* Avoidance reinforces the notion that discomfort, distress and anxiety are bad, or dangerous.
* Sustaining avoidance often requires effort and energy.
* Avoidance limits one's focus at the expense of fully experiencing what is going on in the present.
* Avoidance may get in the way of other important, valued aspects of life.

== Empirical evidence ==

* Laboratory-based [[thought suppression]] studies suggest avoidance is paradoxical, in that concerted attempts at suppression of a particular thought often leads to an increase of that thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.1.5 |title=Paradoxical effects of thought suppression |year=1987 |last1=Wegner |first1=Daniel M. |last2=Schneider |first2=David J. |last3=Carter |first3=Samuel R. |last4=White |first4=Teri L. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=53 |pages=5–13 |pmid=3612492 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Studies examining [[Regulation of emotion#Emotion suppression|emotional suppression]] and pain suppression suggest that avoidance is ineffective in the long-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.106.1.95 |title=Hiding feelings: The acute effects of inhibiting negative and positive emotion |year=1997 |last1=Gross |first1=James J. |last2=Levenson |first2=Robert W. |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=106 |pages=95–103 |pmid=9103721 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.2.274 |title=Delayed costs of suppressed pain |year=1993 |last1=Cioffi |first1=Delia |last2=Holloway |first2=James |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=274–82 |pmid=8433273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, expressing unpleasant emotion results in short-term increases in arousal, but long-term decreases in arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00309.x |title=The Body's Response to Processing Emotional Trauma: Linking Verbal Text with Autonomic Activity |year=1994 |last1=Hughes |first1=Cheryl F. |last2=Uhlmann |first2=Carmen |last3=Pennebaker |first3=James W. |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=565–85 |pmid=7861305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Exposure therapy|Exposure-based therapy]] techniques have been shown to be effective in treating a wide range of psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;
* Numerous self-report studies have linked EA and related constructs ([[avoidance coping]], [[thought suppression]]) to psychopathology and other forms of dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2008.06.003 |title=Obsessive–compulsive symptoms: The contribution of obsessional beliefs and experiential avoidance |year=2009 |last1=Abramowitz |first1=Jonathan S. |last2=Lackey |first2=Gerald R. |last3=Wheaton |first3=Michael G. |journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=160–6 |pmid=18657382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0306-4603(02)00216-2 |title=Anxiety sensitivity, controllability, and experiential avoidance and their relation to drug of choice and addiction severity in a residential sample of substance-abusing veterans |year=2003 |last1=Forsyth |first1=John P. |last2=Parker |first2=Jefferson D. |last3=Finlay |first3=Carlos G. |journal=Addictive Behaviors |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=851–70 |pmid=12788261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2004.04.004 |title=Peritraumatic dissociation and experiential avoidance as predictors of posttraumatic stress symptomatology |year=2005 |last1=Marx |first1=Brian P. |last2=Sloan |first2=Denise M. |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=569–83 |pmid=15865913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.115.4.850 |title=An experimental investigation of emotion dysregulation in borderline personality disorder |year=2006 |last1=Gratz |first1=Kim L. |last2=Rosenthal |first2=M.

== Relevance to psychopathology ==

Seemingly disparate forms of pathological behavior can be understood by their common function (i.e., attempts to avoid distress).  Some examples include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Diagnosis !! Example Behaviors !! Target of Avoidance
|-
| [[Major depression|Major depressive disorder]] || Isolation/suicide || Feelings of sadness, guilt, low self-worth
|-
| [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] || Avoiding trauma reminders, hypervigilance || Memories, anxiety, concerns of safety
|-
| [[Social anxiety disorder|Social phobia]] || Avoiding social situations || Anxiety, concerns of judgment from others
|-
| [[Panic disorder]] || Avoiding situations that might induce panic || Fear, physiological sensations
|-
| [[Agoraphobia]] || Restricting travel outside of home or other "safe areas" || Anxiety, fear of having symptoms of panic
|-
| [[Ocd|Obsessive-compulsive disorder]] || Checking/rituals || Worry of consequences (e.g., "contamination")
|-
| [[Substance use disorder]]s || Abusing alcohol/drugs || Emotions, memories, withdrawal symptoms
|-
| [[Eating disorder]]s || Restricting food intake, purging || Worry about becoming "overweight", fear of losing control
|-
| [[Borderline personality disorder]] || Self-harm (e.g., cutting) || High emotional arousal
|}

== Relevance to quality of life ==

Perhaps the most significant impact of EA is its potential to disrupt and interfere with important, valued aspects of an individual's life.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;  That is, EA is seen as particularly problematic when it occurs at the expense of a person's deeply held values.  Some examples include:

* Putting off an important task because of the discomfort it evokes.
* Not taking advantage of an important opportunity due to attempts to avoid worries of failure or disappointment.
* Not engaging in physical activity/exercise, meaningful hobbies, or other recreational activities due to the effort they demand.
* Avoiding social gatherings or interactions with others because of the anxiety and negative thoughts they evoke.
* Not being a full participant in social gatherings due to attempts to regulate anxiety relating to how others are perceiving you.
* Being unable to fully engage in meaningful conversations with others because one is scanning for signs of danger in the environment (attempting to avoid feeling "unsafe").
* Inability to "connect" and sustain a close relationship because of attempts to avoid feelings of vulnerability.
* Staying in a "bad" relationship to try to avoid discomfort, guilt,  and potential feelings of loneliness a break-up might entail.
* Losing a marriage or contact with children due to an unwillingness to experience uncomfortable feelings (e.g., achieved through drug or alcohol abuse) or symptoms of withdrawal.
* Not attending an important graduation, wedding, funeral, or other family event to try to avoid anxiety or symptoms of panic.
* Engaging in self-destructive behaviors in an attempt to avoid feelings of boredom, emptiness, worthlessness.
* Not functioning or taking care of basic responsibilities (e.g., personal hygiene, waking up, showing up to work, shopping for food) because of the effort they demand and/or distress they evoke.
* Spending so much time attempting to avoid discomfort that one has little time for anyone or anything else in life.

== Measurement ==

=== Self-report ===

The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hayes |first1=Steven C. |last2=Strosahl |first2=Kirk |last3=Wilson |first3=Kelly G. |last4=Bissett |first4=Richard T. |last5=Pistorello |first5=Jacqueline |last6=Toarmino |first6=Dosheen |last7=Polusny |first7=Melissa A. |last8=Dykstra |first8=Thane A. |last9=Batten |first9=Sonja V. |year=2004 |title=Measuring Experiential Avoidance: A Preliminary Test of a Working Model |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=553–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first self-report measure explicitly designed to measure EA, but has since been re-conceptualized as a measure of "[[psychological flexibility]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hayes |first=Steven |date=December 27, 2009 |title=Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ) and Variations |url=http://contextualpsychology.org/acceptance_action_questionnaire_aaq_and_variations |publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science |accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (MEAQ)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0023242 |title=Development of a measure of experiential avoidance: The Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire |year=2011 |last1=Gámez |first1=Wakiza |last2=Chmielewski |first2=Michael |last3=Kotov |first3=Roman |last4=Ruggero |first4=Camilo |last5=Watson |first5=David |journal=Psychological Assessment |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=692–713 |pmid=21534697}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed to measure different aspects of EA.

'''Family-centered practices''' (FCPs) use a variety of different tools for child development,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/famcentered/&lt;/ref&gt; where the development, provision, and assessment of [[Health care|healthcare]] is equally constructive to both children and their families. FCP is valuable to clients of all children and can be applied in many different healthcare settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shields | first1 = L. | last2 = Pratt | first2 = J. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Family centred care: a review of qualitative studies | url = | journal = Journal of clinical nursing | volume = 15 | issue = 10| pages = 1317–1323 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01433.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

FCP uses different types of implementations such as intervention planning, providing learning opportunities and information, teaching interaction skills, delivering family therapy sessions, and teaching non-judgment and the positives of non-judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family-Centered Practice|url=http://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Autism/Family-Centered-Practice/|website=American Speech-hearing Association|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make FCPs successful, it is important to learn about the family system and to properly assess the intervention that respects the participating family.&lt;ref&gt;Hecimovic, A., Powell, T. H., &amp; Christensen, L. (1999) and that supports families in meeting their needs. In D. B. Zager (Ed.), Autism: Identification, education, and treatment (2nd ed., pp. 261–299). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

Family centered practices can be used for many different situations. They can be used for cases such as child abuse and/or neglect. Using the FCP approach may be difficult in the case of caregivers who do not see a need for change.&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;Kemp, S. P., Marcenko, M. O., Lyons, S. J., &amp; Kruzich, J. M. (2014). Strength-based practice and parental engagement in child welfare services: An empirical examination. Children and Youth Services Review, 47(P1), 27-35&lt;/ref&gt; When trials of family centered practices were used by the Washington State Social and Health Services, 6% of all participants were deemed to have success and see change.&lt;ref name ="Kemp" /&gt; In those trials, circumstances, where children had been removed from their home and placed into another home (i.e. foster care or group home), were taken into account.

== Background ==

The idea of FCP came from Dr John Sullivan, at the Institute for Family Centered Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.familycenteredtreatment.com/fct-foundation/board-of-directors.html|title=Board of Directors|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Family centred treatment|publisher=|access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's goal was to show families that they were important and influential in a child's life. Interventions were designed to assist families in degrading situations. Participants were taught positive peer culture, and the importance of each individual's dignity, respect, and skill.&lt;ref name="FamilyCentered"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Family Centered Treatment|url=http://www.familycenteredtreatment.com/fct-model.html|website=Family Centered Treatment|publisher=Polished Greek|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first participants were brought to the attention of John Sullivan from the Juvenile Justice system. After success was shown, the Family and Children's Social Services began to participate. By 1989, there were multiple organizations using FCP techniques.&lt;ref name="FamilyCentered" /&gt; By the 2000s, the practice had spread to nearly every U.S. state and the idea became a normal intervention in the lives of [[Child abuse|troubled, abused, neglected, and maltreated children]] and their families.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Applications ==

FCP focuses on the family as the primary unit of attention&lt;ref name="trainingmatters"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Family-Centered Approach|url=http://www.trainingmatters-nc.org/tm_vol4_no1/tm_vol4no1.htm|website=Training Matters|publisher=Jordan Institute for Families|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while encouraging strength, respect, and support within the family.&lt;ref name="trainingmatters" /&gt; Instructors are most often [[social work]]ers. They begin their work by evaluating the family with the child/children and the family without the child/children. The goal from the evaluation is to build consistent, ethical, and effective child welfare practice within the family.&lt;ref name="trainingmatters" /&gt; Once the evaluation step is complete, the instructor focuses on building a program in conjunction with the family, rather than simply dictating one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunst|first1=Carl J.|last2=Johanson|first2=Charlie|last3=Trivette|first3=Carol M.|last4=Hamby|first4=Debbie|title=Family-Oriented Early Intervention Policies and Practices: Family-Centered or Not?|journal=Exceptional Children|date=1 October 1991|volume=58|issue=2|pages=115–126|doi=10.1177/001440299105800203|url=http://ecx.sagepub.com/content/58/2/115.short|language=en|issn=0014-4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ensures that the caregivers maintain authority, and improves program results. The program concludes after a set period of time, that is usually set by the court or social worker, depending on the severity of the child's case.

In developed countries, such as Australia, most hospital settings claim to be family-centered. This means the hospitals have implemented an attitude where they believe that parents are essential to their child's well-being, and therefore crucial to the decision-making process regarding their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=November 2004|title=Implementing family-centred care|url=http://www.ajan.com.au/Vol23/Vol23.1-4.pdf|journal=An exploration of the beliefs and practices of paediatric nurses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==

After consultations with FCPs, the results in families differ, as no two families are the same. Each family has its own beliefs and values, which the social worker must take into account while helping create a program designed for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=Daniel S.|last2=Dishion|first2=Thomas J.|last3=Supplee|first3=Lauren|last4=Gardner|first4=Frances|last5=Arnds|first5=Karin|title=Randomized trial of a family-centered approach to the prevention of early conduct problems: 2-year effects of the family check-up in early childhood.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=2006|volume=74|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.74.1.1|pmid=16551138}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the evaluation step, if the social worker was able to find out the severity of the child's maltreatment, the goal has been met. Even if use of an FCP is not continued, other steps can be taken to provide for the safety and well-being of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCroskey|first1=Jacquelyn|last2=Meezan|first2=William|title=Family Centered Services: Approaches and Effectiveness|journal=The Future of Children|date=1998|volume=8|issue=1|url=https://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/docs/08_01_03.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florence Rush''' (January 23, 1918 – December 9, 2008) was an American certified [[social work]]er (M.S.W. from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name=Love&gt;Love, Barbara J. and [[Nancy F. Cott]]. ''Feminists Who Changed America, 1963&amp;mdash;1975.'' University of Illinois Press, 2008 p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;), [[feminism|feminist]] theorist and organizer best known for introducing [[The Freudian Coverup]] in her presentation "The Sexual Abuse of Children: A Feminist Point of View" about childhood sexual abuse and [[incest]] at the April 1971 [[New York Radical Feminists]] (NYRF) [[Rape]] Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noreen Connell|Connell, Noreen]] and Wilson, Casandra, eds. ''Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women by New York Radical Feminists'' New American Library, 1974 p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Rush's paper at the time was the first challenge to [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] theories of children as the seducers of adults rather than the victims of adults' sexual/power exploitation.&lt;ref name=Villager&gt;Obituary "Florence Rush, 90, feminist author who focused on child abuse", ''[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]]'', December 24&amp;ndash;30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Rush was born to Russian immigrants in [[Manhattan]] and grew up in the [[Bronx, NY]] before moving to [[New Rochelle, NY]]. She subsequently moved to Manhattan's [[Greenwich Village]] in the early 1970s. She was married to Bernard Rush and is survived by son, Thomas, his two children, and daughter, Eleanor.&lt;ref name=Villager/&gt; In 2005, she was honored with the New York City NOW's Chapter [[Susan B. Anthony]] Award to grassroots feminists.&lt;ref name="Connell"/&gt;

==Career==

Rush observed the problem of childhood sexual abuse as a psychiatric social worker at the [[New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]]&lt;ref&gt;Kamienski, Laura Ann ''Women's Self Defense'' Internet essay, accessed January 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and at a facility for delinquent female adolescents, although at the time&amp;mdash;during the 1950s and 1960s&amp;mdash;such therapists were instructed to avoid discussing incest with their young patients because of prevailing Freudian theories.&lt;ref&gt;Hallen-Pleck, Elizabeth, ''Domestic Tyranny, The Making of American Social Policy Against Family Violence from Colonial Times to the Present.'' University of Illinois Press, 2004 p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Rush's NYRF Rape Conference presentation about incest and childhood sexual abuse reviewed psychiatric and psychoanalytical literature from Freud to that time that attributed such problems to children's seduction of adults or erotic fantasies. She then linked these prevailing psychiatric theories about the child's instigation of or erotic fantasies about incest and sexual abuse to maintaining a climate for the political and psychological oppression of women. As Rush concluded in her presentation the "sexual abuse of children..is an unspoken but prominent factor in socializing and preparing the female to accept a subordinate role: to feel guilty, ashamed, and to tolerate through fear, the power exercised over her by men." &lt;ref name=Connell&gt;Connell, Noreen, February 24, 2005 New York National Organization for Women Susan B. Anthony Awards ceremony presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doane, Janice L. and Hodges, Devon L. ''Telling Incest.'' University of Michigan Press, 2001 p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Rush subsequently authored the 1977 ''Freud and the Sexual Abuse of Children'' in the first volume of a feminist theory journal, ''Chyrsalis'',&lt;ref&gt;Braude, Marjorie, ''Women, Power and Therapy.'' Hawthorne Press, 1987 p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1980 Prentice Hall ''The Best Kept Secret: The Sexual Abuse of Children'' that additionally traced the toleration of sexual abuse of children to the beginnings of history. Her continued work to counter sexual abuse of women and children and the media imagery feminists believe propagates such abuse encompassed key roles in many organizations. She served as 1979 co-founder and 1979-1987 lecturer for [[Women Against Pornography]], 1980&amp;ndash;1985 chair of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW)'s New York City Chapter's Media Reform Committee, Board of Directors Member of New York Women Against Rape where she produced and exhibited a slide presentation on the increasing media eroticism of children, and member of the [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]]'s Advisory Committee on the Treatment of Sexual Aggressors.&lt;ref name=Connell /&gt;

==Activism==

Rush was an early participant in the second wave of U.S. feminism when, in 1970, she became co-founder and steering committee member of [[Older Women's Liberation]] (OWL).&lt;ref name=Love /&gt; She was to conclude her  feminist work between 2002 and 2005 as chair of New York City NOW's Older Women's Committee where she organized against Republican presidential and congressional efforts to reduce budget deficits by reining in Social Security and Medicare benefit costs.&lt;ref name="Connell"/&gt;

Rush was also concerned about women's role definitions and expectations within families as author of ''Women in the Middle'', the first article about [[sandwich generation]] women taking care of both children and elderly relatives, published in ''Notes from the Third Year'' and ''Radical Feminism''&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Jane, ''Juggling.'' Feminist Press, 1997 p.154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Koedt|Koedt, Anne]], Ellen Levine, and Anita Rapone, eds. ''Radical Feminism''. Quadrangle/New York Times Book Company, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s she produced and exhibited a slide show presentation "From [[Mother Goddess]] to [[Father Knows Best]]" about the depreciation of mothers from ancient mythology to 20th century media representations.&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;Rich, Nicole, "From Suburban Housewife to Radical Feminist" in [[Phyllis Chesler|Chesler, Phyllis]], Rothblum, Esther, Cole, Ellen eds. ''Feminist Foremothers in Women's Studies.'' Hawthorne Press, 1996 pp.419-425&lt;/ref&gt; As a mother struggling with the role of caretaker to her son, Matthew, and his lover, Ron, when they became ill with [[AIDS]] in 1987, Rush's organizing around feminist issues extended to mothers of AIDS patients as an active participant in a mothers' support group of the People With AIDS Coalition of New York &lt;ref&gt;Dullea, Georgia, "AIDS Mothers' Undying Hope", ''[[New York Times]]'', April 20, 1994 accessed January 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After Matthew and Ron died in 1990, she founded and participated in the first Bereavement Group for such mothers.&lt;ref name=Rich /&gt;

In 1977, Rush became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

'''Foreskin Man''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] created by Matthew Hess to protest against [[circumcision]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Foreskin Man's alter ego is Miles Hastwick, a former corporate scientist now curator of the ''Museum of Genital Integrity''.&lt;ref name="Miles Hastwick"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foreskinman.com/mileshastwick.htm | title=Miles Hastwick | publisher=MGMbill Comics | accessdate=September 21, 2011 | author=Hess, Matthew | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808021543/http://www.foreskinman.com/mileshastwick.htm | archivedate=August 8, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is adamantly against the practice of circumcision. In the first issue, Hastwick comes up with the alter ego of Foreskin Man to fight against practitioners of circumcision and "the pro-circumcision lobby," whom he feels have gained too much power through "all of the well connected doctors and lawyers."&lt;ref name="Issue 1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Foreskin Man Issue # 1 | publisher=MGMbill Comics | author=Hess, Matthew | year=2010 | pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third issue of the comic, he teams up with a female heroine, dubbed "Vulva Girl," who fights to oppose [[female genital mutilation]]. Together, they travel to [[Kenya]] to stop tribal circumcisions. &lt;ref name="ep3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/bloggish/item/foreskin_man_meet_vulva_girl_20110629/|title=Foreskin Man, Meet Vulva Girl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ep32"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/foreskin-man-vulva-girl-team-battle-circumcision-africa-040607037.html|title=Foreskin Man and Vulva Girl Team Up to Battle Circumcision in Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth issue, he travels to [[Turkey]] to prevent the teenage son of a   belly dancer from receiving an Islamic circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lipman, [http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/104724/foreskin-man-back-battle-muslim-circumcision "Foreskin Man is back to battle Muslim circumcision"], ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', April 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Debra Saunders|Debra J. Saunders]], [http://blog.sfgate.com/djsaunders/2013/04/04/foreskin-man-goes-to-turkey/ "Foreskin Man goes to Turkey"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', April 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth issue shows him battling against the head of a company that collects foreskins for use in cosmetics and, in the sixth issue, he goes to the [[Philippines]] to disrupt [[Tuli (rite)|Operation Tuli]]. &lt;ref name="tuli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/161578/a-new-hero-rises-foreskin-man-saves-boys-from-circumcision|title=A new hero rises: ‘Foreskin Man’ saves boys from circumcision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of antisemitism==
The second issue of ''Foreskin Man'', in which the hero fights against a villain named Monster [[Mohel]] drew criticism from the [[Anti-Defamation League]]. Nancy Appel, the ADL's associate director, was quoted as saying,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Mail]], June 19, 2011, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2005515/Introducing-Foreskin-Man-Comic-hero-launched-battle-evil-circumcision.html "'Foreskin Man' accused of anti-semitism row as unlikely comic-book hero does battle with circumcision"], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', June 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The (Monster) mohel has a dark complexion, hook nose and is practically drooling at the thought of apparently doing harm to a child, he even has claws on his fingertips. He is blood thirsty just like the grotesque Jewish stereotypes that appeared in Nazi propaganda. It's absolutely a direct parallel."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Formicophilia''', a form of [[zoophilia]], is the sexual interest in being crawled upon or nibbled by insects, such as ants, or other small creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dewaraja | first = R | year = 1987 | title = Formicophilia, an unusual paraphilia, treated with counseling and behavior therapy | journal = American Journal of Psychotherapy | volume = 41 | pages = 593–597 | pmid = 3434651 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="money"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dewaraja | first = R |author2=Money J |authorlink2=John Money  | year = 1986 | title = Transcultural sexology: Formicophilia, a newly named paraphilia in a young Buddhist male | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 12 | pages = 139–145 | pmid = 3723604 | issue = 2 | doi=10.1080/00926238608415401}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[paraphilia]] often involves the application of insects to the genitals, but other areas of the body may also be the focus. The desired effect may be a tickling, stinging or in the case of [[slugs]], slimy sensation, or the infliction of psychological distress on another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Unusual Sex Practices |last=Love |first=Brenda |authorlink=Brenda Love |year=1992 |publisher=Barricade Books |location=Fort Lee, NJ |isbn=1-56980-011-1 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Ratnin Dewaraja and [[John Money]] in 1986 from the Latin ''formica'' (ant) + the Greek ''philia'' (love).&lt;ref name="money" /&gt;

==Case studies==
In the first reported [[case study]], the patient had started keeping ants in a cupboard of his room as a hobby when he was nine. At this age he enjoyed "the ticklish feeling" of the ants crawling on his legs and thighs. At age ten, he had a sexual relationship with another boy, and was beaten when his father discovered this. By the age of 13 or 14, he had added [[snail]]s and [[cockroach]]es to his collection, and was becoming increasingly preoccupied with it. He had begun masturbating while the ants crawled on his legs. At age 28, he was masturbating several times a week while cockroaches crawled on his thighs and testicles, and snails crawled over his nipples and penis. Sometimes he would hold a frog against his penis and enjoy the vibrations as it tried to escape. The patient was disgusted by his habit, but derived no pleasure from normal sexual activities. John Money suggested that the paraphilia developed as an alternative outlet after his normal sexual expression became associated with the trauma of his father's punishment.&lt;ref name="money" /&gt;

Another case was described in 2012. At the age of 14, the patient saw an ice-cream stick covered with ants, and wondered how it would feel if his penis was in place of the stick. He began letting ants crawl on his genitals, especially [[fire ant]]s, a practice he found sexually exciting and that continued into adulthood. The patient was socially and intellectually competent. He was also attracted to dogs and goats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spizzirri, G. |author2=Becher, G. |author3=Reis, J. |author4= Abdo, C. H.

In a system of '''free-market healthcare''', prices for [[healthcare]] [[goods and services]] are set freely by agreement between patients and health care providers, and the laws and forces of [[supply and demand]] are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority. A free market contrasts with a [[controlled market]], in which government intervenes in supply and demand through non-market methods such as laws creating barriers to market entry or directly setting prices.

Advocates of free-market healthcare contend that systems like [[single-payer healthcare]] and [[publicly funded healthcare]] result in higher costs, inefficiency, longer waiting times for care, denial of care to some, and overall mismanagement.&lt;ref name=stossel&gt;{{cite news|author=[[John Stossel]]|title= Health Insurance Isn't All It's Cracked Up to Be|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/PrescriptionForChange/story?id=2574980&amp;page=1|date=October 16, 2006|accessdate=September 27, 2009|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that health care as an unregulated commodity invokes market failures not present with government regulation and that selling health care as a commodity leads to both unfair and inefficient systems with poorer individuals being unable to afford preventive care.&lt;ref name=stossel/&gt;

==Supporters==

The [[health freedom movement]] supports free choice in healthcare. The libertarian [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] argues in favor of deregulation of the medical profession and healthcare sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mises.org/story/1749 How Medical Boards Nationalized Health Care - Henry Jones - Mises Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A leading supporter of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ronpaul2008.com/issues/health-freedom "Ron Paul 2008 Hope for America"] Accessed 28 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; former Republican congressman [[Ron Paul]] introduced the Health Freedom Protection Act in the U.S. Congress in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=33525 Health Freedom Protection Act Introduced in US Congress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051117180248/http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2005/cr111005.htm Free Speech and Dietary Supplements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman horse.png|thumb|Excavating a Roman horse burial in London in 2006]]
'''Horse burial''' is the practice of [[Burial|burying]] a [[horse]] as part of the ritual of human burial, and is found among many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] peoples and others, including [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Turkic peoples]].  The act indicates the high value placed on horses in the particular cultures and provides evidence of the migration of peoples with a horse culture.  Human burials that contain other [[livestock]] are rare; in Britain, for example, 31 horse burials have been discovered but only one cow burial, unique in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-18580332|title='Bizarre cow woman' found in Cambridgeshire Anglo-Saxon dig|date=25 June 2012|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of horse burial is part of a wider tradition of [[horse sacrifice]]. An associated ritual is that of [[chariot burial]], in which an entire chariot, with or without a horse, is buried with a dead person.

==Background and detail==
The horse carries great symbolic meaning in human cultures (see [[horse worship]]). In Celtic and Germanic cultures, for instance, the horse "could be associated with the journeying sun", and horses were deified and used in [[divination]], but Celtic horse sacrifice is rare whereas horses were regularly sacrificed and buried alongside dead humans in Germany and Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt; The Indo-European ubiquity and importance of horse sacrifice (which in many cases involves a symbolic coupling between king and mare){{fact|date=April 2017}} attests to this importance.&lt;ref name="MalloryAdams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallory|first1=J. P.|last2=Adams|first2=Douglas Q.|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC&amp;pg=PA279|accessdate=26 June 2012|year=1997|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781884964985|pages=273–79|chapter=Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable differences exist between different horse burials even within a single area and culture, so much so that it is perhaps impossible to generalize.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Hilda Roderick Ellis|title=Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-rIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=25 June 2012|year=1988|publisher=Manchester UP|isbn=9780719025792|page=53ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes horses were cremated, sometimes buried; sometimes they were placed in the same grave as humans,&lt;ref name="Carver1998"/&gt; sometimes in a different pit;&lt;ref name="envir"/&gt; some cultures appear to favor horse burial for male warriors, others did not seem to differentiate in gender.&lt;ref name="AndrénJennbert2006"/&gt;

==Geographical and historical distribution==
The practice of horse burial is bound to the historical territory covered by the [[domestication of the horse|domesticated horse]], which initially was the [[Eurasian Steppe]], ca. 4000–3500 BCE. Early cultures with a mythology that would support  horse burial are those in or bordering those areas—Turkic cultures,&lt;ref name="MalloryAdams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Róna-Tas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Róna-Tas|first=András|title=Hungarians and Europe in the Early Middle Ages: An Introduction to Early Hungarian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-RTt0Q6AcYC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=26 June 2012|year=1999|publisher=Central European UP|isbn=9789639116481|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese cultures,&lt;ref name="Johns2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johns|first=Catherine|title=Horses: History, Myth, Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBaiLESllNEC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=26 June 2012|year=2006|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=9780674023239|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Indo-European cultures.&lt;ref name="MalloryAdams"/&gt;

It is claimed that a form of horse burial is attested from the [[Paleolithic]], when the skin of a horse was hung over a pole; some of the animal's bones were left inside the skin to preserve its shape.&lt;ref name="Chamberlin2007"/&gt; This supposed "head and hooves" culture, however, is only one explanation for archeological finds from the third millennium BCE.&lt;ref name="MalloryAdams"/&gt; The earliest proven horse burial in the [[Old World]] dates back to the fifth or fourth millennium BC and is found in S{{'}}ezzhee, in a cemetery on the Volga from the [[Samara culture]].&lt;ref name="Kuzmina"/&gt; Thousands of years later, [[Herodotus]] described the practice among the [[Scythians]]. Typically, such burials involved the sacrifice and burial of one or more horses to accompany the remains of high-ranked members or warriors.&lt;ref name="Chamberlin2007"/&gt; In China, horse burials (including chariots) are found beginning in the Shang Dynasty (1600–1100 BCE).&lt;ref name="Johns2006"/&gt; Remains of the ritual are found in [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] culture, where a dead person's horse is slaughtered a year after its owner's death, in a ceremony accompanied by horse races.&lt;ref name="Chamberlin2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chamberlin|first=J. Edward|title=Horse How the Horse Has Changed Civilizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoSy_V5xDekC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=25 June 2012|year=2007|publisher=Olma Media Group|isbn=9781904955368|page=48ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse burial and related rituals survived among other peoples as well into recent times, for instance among the [[Nez Perce people]] (where skinned and stuffed horses were used as grave monuments) and the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]].&lt;ref name="Chamberlin2007"/&gt;

Sites featuring horse burials are found throughout the regions of the world occupied by Indo-Aryan, Turkic, and Chinese peoples.&lt;ref name="Kuzmina"/&gt; They include [[Tall al-Ajjul]] ([[Gaza strip]], dating back to 2100 BC),&lt;ref name="Gonen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gonen|first=Rivka|title=Burial Patterns and Cultural Diversity in Late Bronze Age Canaan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXGENpNx0wC&amp;pg=PA131|accessdate=25 June 2012|year=1992|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=9780931464683|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Iran, where horse burials are attested in the second millennium BC,&lt;ref name="Kuzmina"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuz'mina|first1=Elena E.|last2=Kuzʹmina|first2=Elena Efimovna|last3=Mallory|first3=J.

===Among Germanic cultures===

[[File:Sutton.Hoo.BucklePieces.JorViking.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of the horse burial in Mound 17, Sutton Hoo.]]
[[Germanic peoples]] attached great significance to the horse; a horse may have been an acquaintance of the god [[Wodan]], and they may have been (according to [[Tacitus]]) confidants of the gods. Scandinavian literature from the 8th to 11th centuries emphasizes the importance of horses in Viking society. Horses were closely associated with gods, especially [[Odin]] and [[Freyr]]. Horses played a central role in funerary practices as well as in other rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jennbert|first=Kristina|title=The Horse and its role in Icelandic burial practices, mythology, and society|year=2006|pages=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses were prominent symbols of fertility, and there were many horse fertility cults. The rituals associated with these include horse fights, burials, consumption of horse meat, and horse sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sikora|first=Maeve|title=Diversity in Viking Age Horse Burial: A Comparative Study of Norway, Iceland, Scotland and Ireland|journal=The Journal of Irish Archaeology|volume=13|issue=2004|pages=87–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse burials are relatively widespread in Iceland; as of 1999, 115 graves were found that contained the remains of horses. There were so many graves in which the remains of a human female was associated with those of a horse, that it was speculated that a horse burial in association with a male warrior did not occur in Iceland.&lt;ref name="AndrénJennbert2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loumand|first=Ulla|editor=Anders Andrén|others=Kristina Jennbert, Catharina Raudvere|title=Old Norse Religion in Long-term Perspectives: Origins, Changes, and Interactions: An International Conference in Lund, Sweden, June 3–7, 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gjq6rvoIRpAC&amp;pg=PA131|accessdate=25 June 2012|year=2006|publisher=Nordic Academic Press|isbn=9789189116818|pages=130–34|chapter=The Horse and its Role in Icelandic Burial Practices, Mythology, and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of the archaeological record in Norway has revealed some patterns that are comparable to horse burials in other areas. Of the six-hundred graves excavated forty of them are horse burials. Horse burials are found in both Norway and Iceland to occur more frequently with males, but are not exclusive to males. There are some female burials with horses, but a significantly lower number of them are found. Most graves are covered by circular or oval mounds. The grave goods found in Viking burials associated with horses in Norway and Iceland are also pretty similar. For male burials there are usually found weapons and tools, and women are usually found with tools, beads, brooches. Both genders are often found buried with riding equipment like horse bits and headstalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sikora|first=Maeve|title=Diversity in Viking Age Horse Burial: A Comparative Study of Norway, Iceland, Scotland and Ireland|journal=The Journal of Irish Archaeology|year=2004|volume=13|pages=87–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Viking burial rituals were complex and dramatic. One witness Ibn Fadlan Risala describes the ship burial ritual in detail. The burial consisted of days of mourning, sewing special burial clothes, dog sacrifice, running horses then cutting them into pieces and putting them in the ship with the deceased, and burning the whole thing. This shows that horse slaughter was dramatic and memorable; it was noted in this story. Also taking into consideration the economic value of horses, it was probably not a decision taken lightly. Given the public display of the sacrifice, it could not have solely been for personal religious reasons and could have had important social implications as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Jacqueline|title=Some Scandinavian Sacrifices|journal=Folklore|year=1967|volume=78|issue=3|pages=190–220|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1967.9717093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Chinese culture===
Horse burials are well-known from Ancient China as well, beginning with the [[Shang Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Johns2006"/&gt; Particularly notable is the tomb of [[Duke Jing of Qi]] (reigned 547–490 BCE), which contained a separate pit with the remains of possibly over 600 horses.&lt;ref name="envir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envir.gov.cn/info/np/file.asp?file=999-9-206.txt |author=张闻宇 |script-title=zh:殉马坑期待保护 |trans-title=Protection needed for sacrificial horse pit |language=Chinese |date=9 September 1999 |publisher=China Environment News |accessdate=27 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606212705/http://www.envir.gov.cn/info/np/file.asp?file=999-9-206.txt |archivedate=6 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xinhua"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/24/content_3396344.htm |title=Ancient site reveals stories of sacrificed horses |newspaper=Xinhua Net |date=24 August 2005 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107215855/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/24/content_3396344.htm |archivedate=7 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later burials, especially from the [[Tang dynasty]], featured the well-known pottery horses.

[[File:janzen32.jpg|thumb|John M. Janzen at Izirangabo refugee camp]]
'''John M. Janzen''' is a Professor [[Emeritus]] in the Department of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of Kansas]]. He has been a leading figure on issues of health, illness, and healing in Southern and [[Central Africa]] since the 1960s and has dedicated much of his career to providing a better understanding of African society. Janzen’s knowledge of the [[Kikongo]] language and his intermittent visits to the lower [[Zaire|Congo]] region between 1964 and 1982 have paved the way for a contextual understanding of the roots of Western [[Equatorial Africa]]n approaches to sickness and healing, combining African and Western derived biomedical therapies. Janzen’s research has expanded to include other African countries such as [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Senegal]], [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Sudan]]. He is the former director of the [[Kansas African Studies Center]] at the [[University of Kansas]], and is currently a professor of medical and [[socio-cultural anthropology]] at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name="BarnesSered2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Linda L.|last2=Sered|first2=Susan Starr|title=Religion and healing in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxQsBwvr0ZUC&amp;pg=PR13|accessdate=12 August 2010|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-516795-5|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

John M. Janzen was born to Hilda Gertrude Neufeldt and Louis Abraham Janzen on October 28, 1937, in the town of [[Newton, Kansas|Newton]] in Central Kansas. He is the second of four children, and one of three boys in his family. He is married to [[Reinhild Kauenhoven]] and has three children.

Upon graduation from Berean Academy in [[Butler County, Kansas]], he attended Bethel College in [[Harvey County, Kansas]] for four years. Here he met his future wife, Reinhild Kauenhoven, a then student-colleague from [[Göttingen]], Germany. After his second year in school, Janzen joined the PAX program of the [[Mennonite Central Committee]] that took him to Africa for two years of service in lieu of joining the U.S. military. During this time, Janzen worked on projects involving education, and helped in the construction of a hospital in the late colonial setting of the South Savannah of [[Belgian Congo]]. It was during this time that Janzen became interested in learning more about Africa. Returning home, Janzen pursued a [[graduate degree]] in [[anthropology]]. He graduated from Bethel College in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in [[Social Science]] and [[Philosophy]], and was accepted to the [[University of Chicago]] as a graduate student in anthropology.

Janzen spent his first year in an intensive study of [[Arabic]] and [[Islamic]] social and political thought with [[Mushin Madhi]], a [[political philosopher]] who specialized in medieval Islamic political thought, at the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] in Chicago. Madhi's work further motivated Janzen to pursue a career in [[ethnography]] and anthropology. The following year, Janzen received a grant from the French government to attend the [[University of Paris]] (Sorbonne), from which he received a certificate of [[African Studies]] in 1963. His stay in a predominantly [[Structuralism|Structuralist]] and [[Marxist]] France influenced Janzen’s ideology and led him to the belief that material existence shapes societies and ideas. Janzen rejected the notion of a solely [[symbolic anthropology]]. Janzen  received an M.A. in Anthropology from the University of Chicago in May 1964, and began his PhD at the University of Chicago soon after. John married Kauenhoven, the same year.

Between 1964 and 1966, John traveled to the lower Congo region, where he examined the social and political organization, economic development, religion, health, and patterns of health care seeking among the [[Kongo people]]s. Here, Janzen’s research took on a [[historical perspective]], as he used the [[pre-colonial]], [[Colonialism|colonial]], and [[post-colonial]] [[mercantile trade]] of the 16th to late 19th centuries to illustrate how the trade contributed to shaping Kongo perceptions of health, suffering, and healing from the 17th to the early 20th centuries. Janzen returned home in 1966 to complete his dissertation, titled "Elemental Categories, Symbols, and Ideas of Association in Kongo-Manianga Society." He received his PhD from the University of Chicago in June 1967.

== Professional life ==

Janzen returned to [[Newton, Kansas]] and began teaching as an assistant professor at Bethel College from 1967-1968. In 1969 he received the [[Social Science Research Council]] Post-Doctoral Fellowship and returned to the lower Congo/Zaire region to complete a study on [[Kongo therapeutics]]. He began teaching as an assistant professor at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] in 1969. It was here that Janzen was first exposed to [[semiotics]]. He looked for ways to connect materiality with ideas and symbols in a continuum, and looked into the work of [[Victor Turner]], who resolved the relation between materiality, consciousness, and ideas, without fixating on any one particular aspect. Janzen also began reading [[Roland Barthes]]' books on semiotics and grew highly interested in the field.

In 1970, Janzen took a break from teaching and traveled to Europe, where he spent a month in Sweden working on Lower Congo archival materials. He returned to his teaching position at McGill and remained there until 1972, when he received an offer as associate professor in socio-cultural anthropology and African studies from the [[University of Kansas]]. In 1974, Janzen published his first book, ''Anthology of Kongo Religion: Primary Texts from Lower Zaire'' (KU Publications 1974).

During his time at the University of Kansas, Janzen published ''The Quest for Therapy in Lower Zaire'' (California, 1978), reissued in paperback as ''The Quest for Therapy: Medical Pluralism in Lower Zaire'' (1982) and in French translation as ''La quête de la thérapie au Bas-Zaïre'' (Karthala, 1995). This was based on Janzen’s Social Science Research Council Post-Doctoral Fellowship, as well as a two-year seminar taught at McGill. The book, which examined the foundations of [[Equatorial African]] approaches to sickness and healing from African and Western-derived [[biomedical]] therapies, received the [[Wellcome Medal]] and Award from the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]] for anthropological research pertaining to medical issues. Eventually the previous series editor, Professor Charles Leslie of the [[University of California Press]], asked him to become editor of the ''[[Comparative Studies of Health Systems and Medical Care]]'' journal, a position he accepted.

While still teaching at the University of Kansas, Janzen received the [[Alexander von Humboldt]] Fellowship for his study on the Western Equatorial African historic [[Lemba people|Lemba]] cult traces in Western European museums. Janzen’s research of the Lemba, which he described as a cult for elite men and women emphasizing alliance building through marriage, trade, and healing, led to the publication of his book ''Lemba (1650–1930): A Drum of Affliction in Africa and the new World'' (1982). In this book, Janzen identifies the sickness of the Lemba as resulting from subordinate's envy of the mercantile elite’s wealth. The drum of affliction, a translation of the proto and [[Bantu languages|pan-Bantu]] word ''ngoma'', typically includes a mode of affliction, a network of those commonly afflicted, visitation on them by an ancestor or [[spirit]] who has experienced the same affliction, and ritual event that brings together healers, the commonly afflicted, and their families in rhythmic, song-dance, therapeutic activity. The drum of affliction paradigm had been explored earlier by [[Victor Turner]]'s work in the [[Southern Savannah]].

Janzen's work on the Ngoma paradigm led to further exploration of the phenomenon by expanding his research into Central and Southern Africa. He traveled to much of the Eastern and Western Bantu areas of Africa. His position as a lecturer at the [[University of Cape Town]] facilitated his access to information and contacts. He published ''Ngoma: Discourses of Healing in Central and Southern Africa'' in 1992. Another aspect of Janzen’s work during this time was the tracing of Kongo culture to the New World.

Also dedicated to his research on the Mennonites, Janzen remained actively involved in Mennonite affairs. In 1991, Janzen and his wife, Reinhild, co-authored a book, which was the catalogue of a special exhibit at the museum, titled ''Mennonite Furniture: A Migrant Tradition 1766-1910''. Janzen became heavily involved in Mennonite history during a 1989 sabbatical, when he and his wife traced the regions from the Netherlands to the Baltic Seacoast.

Janzen’s work on African healing continued to expand when in 1994–1995, he was asked to travel to the post-genocide [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] Region of Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern Zaire/Congo. This led to another book; "Do I Still have a Life? Voices from the Aftermath of War in Rwanda and Burundi" (2001), a comparison of the actions of ordinary people and leaders in several communes in Rwanda and Burundi leading up to, and following, the war and genocide.

His work at the University of Kansas soon developed into a concentration on African [[Medical Anthropology]], involving work with war, [[Physical trauma|trauma]], healing, [[semiotics]], socio-cultural anthropology, and medical anthropology. During this time, Janzen published ''The Social Fabric of Health: An Introduction to Medical Anthropology'' (2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9475">'''The Kvikk case''' is about a variety of [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] in the children of the men who served on [[HNoMS Kvikk (P984)|HNoMS ''Kvikk'']]. AN investigation found that the ship's electronic systems were not to blame; no other cause has been established. 

Suspicion arose when two former [[officer (armed forces)|officers]] accidentally met in the [[orthopedy|orthopedic]] department at [[Haukeland University Hospital]] in [[Bergen]], and it was later revealed that in all eleven children already had been born with birth defects from 1987 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntnu.no/universitetsavisa/0598/kvikk.html NTNU universitetsavisa: Kvikk ble frikjent] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the case counted 17 injured children, and it was also discovered that the phenomenon of birth defects already had started in 1983. 

Among the claimed birth defects are [[clubfoot]], [[thumb hypoplasia]], [[Hip dysplasia (human)|hip dysplasia]], [[congenital heart defect]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/kvikk/Fikk-ingen-advarsler-1799462.html bt.no: Fikk ingen advarsler] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; structural [[brain damage]], [[cataract]]s, and other defects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1580073.ece Aftenposten.no: 17 millioner til «Kvikk»-barna]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the children have also had [[mental retardation|developmental delays]] and [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|behavioral problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2000/09/20/219913.html Dagbladet.no: «Kvikk»-barn får oftere klumpfot] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kvikk was the only vessel in the Norwegian navy that was used as an [[electronic warfare]] (EW) vessel, and one widely discussed theory was that the powerful [[electromagnetic radiation]] from the boat's radio communication masts and [[radar]] led to several of those who served aboard the ship having children with clubfoot, and in some cases [[stillbirth|stillborn]] children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.202842 NRK Hordaland: Lover erstatning til «Kvikk»-ofre] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was that the powerful radiation possibly damaged genetic material in the [[sperm]] of the men who worked aboard.&lt;ref&gt;Medical chief at Haakonsvern marine base Jan Helge Halleraker to Forsvarets Forum the 26 March 1997: «Om vi sitter igjen med bevis på at sædceller påvirkes og skades av elektromagnetisk stråling i visse frekvenser, da har vi tatt medisinen ett hakk videre» (Norwegian) (Translated: "If we can prove that sperm cells are affected and damaged by electromagnetic radiation at certain frequencies, then we have taken medicine a step further"&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 17 out of 85 children of officers who served at Kvikk have been born with birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.196109 NRK Hordaland: Nyttig "Kvikk"-granskning] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the other theories about the cause of the deformities is one that ''Kvikk'' was the only vessel that was used to experiment with different types of camouflage paint.

== 1987-94: Kvikk used for electronic warfare ==
In 1987 Kvikk was equipped for electronic warfare, partly by getting an extra radar sender [[stern]] rated to 750 watts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/kvikk/--Kvikk-burde-vart-stengt-1806810.html bt.no: - «Kvikk» burde vært stengt] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; which then was used very actively to create [[Radar jamming and deception|radar jamming]] during exercises and tests. Kvikk went out of service as an EW-vessel in December 1994.

=== Risk for radiation injuries ===
The [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] knew before the case came up that very powerful radiation had been measured on Kvikk. There had also been measured heavy radiation at other defense vessels as well as land installations that all exceeded [[NATO]]'s limits for radiation hazard,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/kvikk/--Kvikk-burde-vart-stengt-1806810.html bt.no: - «Kvikk» burde vært stengt] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.1544534 NRK Hordaland: -Ingen jubel] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[HNoMS Narvik (F 304)|HNoMS Narvik]] and [[HNoMS Tjeld (P 989)|HNoMS Tjeld]]. Kvikk, however, is a much smaller vessel than those, and the radiation distance to the crew was thus smaller. It was also not uncommon for the crew on Kvikk to reside around the mast during noise transmissions, and they were thus directly exposed to strong electromagnetic radiation from the mast that it has been speculated in whether may have affected their genetic material.

As an additional risk factor the radar on Kvikk had a stabilizer that were made to ensure that the radar beam was kept level with the horizon so that it also would work in choppy seas, but this mechanism had a weakness that made the radar tip over many times and thus sending radiation directly down on the deck. Therefore the crew in many cases have been directly exposed to radiation at a very close hold when they were on the deck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.413236 NRK Hordaland: Feil førte til radarstråling] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, four fathers who worked as [[electronic service technician]]s at the workshop of [[Haakonsvern]] got children with [[chromosome abnormality|chromosome abnormalities]]. They worked, among other things, to correct errors and deficiencies in telecommunications equipment on Kvikk and other marine vessels, and were therefore under testing exposed to high levels of electromagnetic radiation, mostly from radars&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.196764 NRK Hordaland: Stråling kan ha gitt misdannelser] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; and communications equipment.

It is shown in research from the 60's and 70's that non-ionizing radiation in the microwave range can provide genotoxic mechanisms in germ cells in animals which are then relayed to the offspring, as well as practical examples have shown that radiation have led to infertility in humans,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/kvikk/En-nysgjerrig-forsker-1799457.html bt.no: En nysgjerrig forsker] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; but little recent research supports this.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} 

The Norwegian Navy, the [[Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority]] (NRPA) and a research group at [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] have concluded that there is no demonstrable link between the non-ionizing radiation on board and that the children were born with birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.413236 NRK Hordaland: Feil førte til radarstråling] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; The parents in the case have stated that they don't trust the research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.415608 NRK Hordaland: Full gjennomgang av Kvikk-saken] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==1996: The case comes forward==
The case became known as the Haakonsvern Navy Base in 1996 issued a press release stating that an unusually high number of children of the employees at the naval base were damaged at birth. [[Verdens Gang]] (VG) was the first newspaper that took hold of the case, and the newspaper also found the relationship between the children who were born with birth defects and that their fathers had worked at Kvikk. VG immediately published a headline that read "Crown Prince [[Haakon Magnus of Norway]] is one of the many who is currently aboard the MTB vessels and may be exposed to radiation."

The navy quickly made a decision to investigate whether there was a correlation between the electromagnetic radiation aboard Kvikk and the genes of those who had served there, but then Kvikk was already broken up - only nine days after the original press release from Haakonsvern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1580073.ece Aftenposten.no: 17 millioner til «Kvikk»-barna] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==1998: Initial research by the navy==
After three officers in February 1996 had notified the navy [[inspectorate]] that they had got children with birth defects after serving on Kvikk, the navy the same year gave an internal message that they did not want to hear anymore about such abnormalities from the naval staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.204391 NRK Hordaland: Forventar full gransking] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The navy began to investigate whether the damages in this and similar cases could be due to radar and radio radiation. In 1998 they concluded that this was not the case and that there was no relationship between serving on the ship and having children with birth defects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/kvikk/Kvikk-ofre-far-erstatning-1828722.html bt.no: «Kvikk»-ofre får erstatning] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; so that there was no basis for [[Legal liability|liability]]. In the report, the Navy went far in rejecting any possible link whatsoever between birth defects to their children and that the fathers had served on Kvikk, and suggested statistical clustering as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tu.no/nyheter/forsvar/2000/09/21/ingen-fasit-for-kvikk Teknisk Ukeblad: Ingen fasit for Kvikk] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34667">'''Marcellus Empiricus''', also known as '''Marcellus Burdigalensis''' (“Marcellus of [[Bordeaux]]”), was a [[Latin]] medical writer from [[Gaul]] at the turn of the 4th and 5th centuries. His only extant work is the ''De medicamentis'', a [[compendium]] of [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] preparations drawing on the work of multiple medical and scientific writers as well as on [[traditional medicine|folk remedies]] and [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]. It is a significant if quirky text in the history of European medical writing, an infrequent subject of [[monograph]]s, but regularly mined as a source for magic charms, [[Celts|Celtic]] [[herbology]] and lore, and the linguistic study of [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Vulgar Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;Carmélia Opsomer and Robert Halleux, “Marcellus ou le mythe empirique,” in ''Les écoles médicales à Rome. Actes du 2ème Colloque international sur les textes médicaux latins antiques, Lausanne, septembre 1986'', edited by Philippe Mudry and [[Jackie Pigeaud]] (Geneva: Librairie Droz, 1991), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bonus auctor est'' (“he’s a good authority”) was the judgment of [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|J.J. Scaliger]],&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Prima Scaligerana'' of 1740, cited by George W. Robinson, “[[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Joseph Scaliger]]’s Estimates of Greek and Latin Authors,” ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 29 (1918) p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; while the science historian [[George Sarton]] called the ''De medicamentis'' an “extraordinary mixture of traditional knowledge, popular (Celtic) medicine, and rank [[superstition]].”&lt;ref&gt;[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927), vol. 1, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcellus is usually identified with the ''[[magister officiorum]]'' of that name who held office during the reign of [[Theodosius I]].

==Life and political career==
Little is known of the life of Marcellus. The primary sources are:
:*Marcellus’s own preface to the ''De medicamentis'';
:*the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' (probably referring to this Marcellus);
:*a letter written in 399 by [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]] to a Marcellus who is likely to have been the medical writer;
:*a letter written by the [[Antioch]]an scholar [[Libanius]] that mentions a Marcellus;
:*an [[epigraphy|inscription]] in [[Narbonne]] (his association with which would require that he not be from Bordeaux; see [[Marcellus Empiricus#Christian benefactor?|below]]);
:*an anecdote in [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] about an unnamed Gaul (also a highly conjectural link).

The Gallic origin of Marcellus is rarely disputed, and he is traditionally identified with the [[toponym]] Burdigalensis; that is, from Bordeaux (Latin Burdigala), within the [[Roman province]] of [[Aquitaine#History|Aquitania]]. In his prefatory [[epistle]], he refers to three [[Bordeaux|Bordelaise]] [[praetorian prefect]]s as his countrymen: [[Siburius]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], and Julius Ausonius, the father of the poet [[Ausonius|Decimus Magnus Ausonius]].&lt;ref&gt;Alf Önnerfors, “Marcellus, ''De medicamentis'': Latin de science, de superstition, d’humanité,” in ''Le latin médical: La constitution d’un langage scientifique: réalités et langage de la médecine dans le monde romain,'' edited by Guy Sabbah (Université de Saint-Étienne, 1991), p. 397; Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval [[Materia Medica]],” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p. 51, note 4, as reprinted in ''Pristina Medicamenta: Ancient and Medieval Medical Botany'', edited by Katherine E. Stannard and Richard Kay, Variorum Collected Studies Series (Aldershot 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes thought to have come from [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonne]] rather than Bordeaux.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Matthews, “Gallic Supporters of [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]],” ''Latomus'' 30 (1971), pp. 1084–1087.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been an attempt to make a Spanish [[Roman senate|senator]] of him on the basis of Symmachus's reference to property he owned in [[Hispania|Spain]]; but this inference ignores that Marcellus is said explicitly to have left Spain to return to living ''in avitis [[Di Penates|penatibus]]'', or among the [[Household deity|household spirits]] of his grandfathers — that is, at home as distinguished from Spain. He probably wrote the ''De medicamentis liber'' during his retirement there.&lt;ref&gt;Spanish origin argued by K.F. Stroheker, ''Spanische Senatoren der spätrömischen und westgotischen Zeit,'' in ''Madrider Mitteilungen'' (1963) p. 121, note 75, cited and contradicted by J.F. Matthews, “Gallic Supporters of Theodosius,” ''Latomus'' 30 (1971) p. 1085. The ''De medicamentis'' seems to refer to [[Theodosius II]], son of the emperor who had appointed Marcellus to office, suggesting that it was not circulated until his accession in January 408; see Alan Cameron, “A New Fragment of Eunapius,” ''Classical Review'' 17 (1967) 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Theodosius I. Roman Coin.jpg|left|thumb|Numismatic image of '''Theodosius I''']]
The author of the ''De medicamentis'' is most likely the Marcellus who was appointed ''[[magister officiorum]]'' by [[Theodosius I]]. The heading of the prefatory epistle identifies him as a ''[[Vir illustris|vir inlustris]]'', translatable as “a distinguished man,” but a more formal designation of rank that indicates he had held imperial office. Marcellus's 16th-century editor [[Janus Cornarius]] gives the unhelpful phrase ''ex magno officio'' (something like “from high office”); coupled with two references in the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] to a Marcellus as ''magister officiorum'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' [http://ancientrome.ru/ius/library/codex/theod/liber16.htm vi.29.8] (May 395) and [http://ancientrome.ru/ius/library/codex/theod/liber16.htm xvi.5.29] (November 395).&lt;/ref&gt; Cornarius's phrase has been taken as a mistaken expansion of the standard abbreviation ''mag. off.'' The ''magister officiorum'' was a sort of [[Minister of the Interior]]&lt;ref&gt;Alf Önnerfors, “Marcellus, ''De medicamentis'',” in ''Le latin médical'' (Université de Saint-Étienne, 1991), p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; and the identification is consistent with what is known of the author's life and with the politics of the time.&lt;ref&gt;For careful and thoroughly documented conjecture about the political career of Marcellus, see J.F. Matthews, “Gallic Supporters of Theodosius,” ''Latomus'' 30 (1971) 1073–1099.&lt;/ref&gt; His stated connection to the [[Ausonius|Ausonii]] makes it likely that he was among the several aristocratic Gauls who benefitted politically when the emperor [[Gratian]] appointed his Bordelaise tutor Ausonius to high office and from Theodosius's extended residence in the western empire during the latter years of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Matthews. “Gallic Supporters of Theodosius,” ''Latomus'' 30 (1971), p. 1086, who points out that earlier (in the period 379–88) Spaniards had predominated in Theodosius’s court.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcellus would have entered his office sometime after April 394 A.D., when his predecessor is last attested,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' [http://ancientrome.ru/ius/library/codex/theod/liber07.htm vii.1.14].&lt;/ref&gt; and before the emperor's death on January 17, 395. He was replaced in late November or December of 395, as determined by the last reference to a Marcellus holding office that is dated November 24 and by the dating of a successor.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' [http://ancientrome.ru/ius/library/codex/theod/liber16.htm xvi.5.29].&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of his departure suggests that he had been a supporter of [[Rufinus (Byzantine official)|Rufinus]], the calculating politician of Gallic origin who was assassinated November 27 of that year, having failed to resist if not facilitating the advance of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] and the [[Visigoths]]. Marcellus's support may have been pragmatic or superficial; a source that condemns Rufinus heartily praises Marcellus as “the very soul of excellence.”&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, “A New Fragment of [[Eunapius]],” ''Classical Review'' 17 (1967) 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given Rufinus's dealings with the Visigoths, however, it is conceivable that Marcellus should be identified with “a certain former high-ranking official from Narbonne” mentioned by Orosius&lt;ref&gt;Orosius 7.43.4: ''virum quendam Narbonensem inlustris sub Theodosio militiae, etiam religiosum prudentemque et gravem''.&lt;/ref&gt; as present in [[Bethlehem#Roman and Byzantine periods|Bethlehem]] in 415 A.D. While visiting [[Jerome]], Orosius says he heard this Gaul relate the declaration made by [[Ataulf|Athaulf]], king of the Visigoths, at Narbonne regarding his intentions toward the Roman empire.&lt;ref&gt;For the text of that declaration in English translation, see article on [[Ataulf]].&lt;/ref&gt; John Matthews argued that Marcellus, who would have been about 60 at the time, is “clearly the most eligible candidate.”&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Matthews, “Gallic Supporters of Theodosius,” ''Latomus'' 30 (1971), pp. 1085–1086.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Orosius identifies the Gaul only as having served under Theodosius, and as a “devout, cautious, and serious” person, other figures have been put forth as the likely bearer of the Athaulf declaration.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, David Frye, “A Mutual Friend of Athaulf and Jerome,” ''Historia'' 40 (1991) 507–508, argues for the Gaul named Rusticus who is mentioned in Jerome’s epistles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical background==
It is not unreasonable but also not necessary to conclude that Marcellus was a practicing physician. In his [[dissertation]], the [[Intellectual history|intellectual historian]] of magic and medicine [[Lynn Thorndike]] pronounced him the “court physician” of Theodosius I,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Thorndike]], ''The Place of Magic in the Intellectual History of Europe'' (New York 1905), p. 99,&lt;/ref&gt; but the evidence is thin: Libanius, if referring to this Marcellus, praises his ability to cure a headache.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Thorndike, ''History of Magic and Experimental Science'' (Columbia University Press 1923), p. 584, without citing the specific letter.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing view is that Marcellus should be categorized as a medical writer and not a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p. 48; Alf Önnerfors, “Marcellus, ''De medicamentis'',” in ''Le latin médical'' (Université de Saint-Étienne, 1991), pp. 398–399; Carmélia Opsomer and Robert Halleux, “Marcellus ou le mythe empirique,” in ''Les écoles médicales à Rome'', (Geneva: Librairie Droz, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; A translator of the medical writings of [[Isidore of Seville]] characterizes Marcellus as a “medical amateur” and dismisses the ''De medicamentis'' as “nothing more than the usual ancient home remedies,”&lt;ref&gt;William D. Sharpe, introduction to “[[Isidore of Seville]]: The Medical Writings. An English Translation with an Introduction and Commentary,” ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' 54 (1964), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and the historian of botany [[Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer|Ernst Meyer]] seems to have considered him a dilettante.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer|E.H.F. Meyer]], ''Geschichte der Botanik'' (Königsberg 1854–57), vol. 2, p. 300, cited by Önnerfors, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Ausonius]] and later [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], Marcellus is among those aristocratic Gauls of the 4th and 5th centuries who were nominally or even devoutly [[Christianity|Christian]] but who fashioned themselves after the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] ideal of the [[nobiles|Roman noble]]: a career in politics balanced with country [[Roman villa|villas]] and informational or literary writing on a range of subjects, including philosophy, astronomy, agriculture, and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Habinek, ''The Politics of Latin Literature: Writing, Empire, and Identity in Ancient Rome'' (Princeton University Press, 1998); Roland Mayer, “Creating a Literature of Information in Rome,” in ''Wissensvermittlung in dichterischer Gestalt'' (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 2005), pp. 227–241.&lt;/ref&gt; Although medical writing might have been regarded as a lesser achievement, it was a resource for the ''[[pater familias]]'' who traditionally took personal responsibility for the health care of his household, both family members and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Rawson]], ''Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 170; Carmélia Opsomer and Robert Halleux, “Marcellus ou le mythe empirique,” in ''Les écoles médicales à Rome'' (Geneva: Librairie Droz, 1991), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptions for [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary treatments]] dispersed throughout the ''De medicamentis'' also suggest the interests and concerns of the author — the letter from Symmachus serves mainly to inquire whether Marcellus can provide thoroughbred horses for games to be sponsored by his son, who has been elected [[praetor]] — and of his intended audience, either the owners of estates or the literate workers who managed them.&lt;ref&gt;Literacy among farm workers at the managerial level was perhaps not meant to be surprising; according to an interlocutor in [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]’s ''De re rustica'' (2.18), a master ought to require his cattleman to read veterinary excerpts from the work of [[Mago (agricultural writer)|Mago the Carthaginian]], available in Latin and Greek translations.&lt;/ref&gt; “[[Do it yourself|Do-it-yourself]]” manuals were popular among the landowning elite because they offered, as Marcellus promises, a form of self-sufficiency and mastery.&lt;ref&gt;''De medicamentis'' prefatory epistle 3, edition of Maximillian Niedermann, ''Marcelli de medicamentis liber,'' vol. 5 of the Teubner ''Corpus Medicorum Latinorum'' (Leipzig, 1916), p. 3; discussion of general topic in Brendon Reay, “Agriculture, Writing, and Cato’s Aristocratic Self-Fashioning,” ''Classical Antiquity'' 24 (2005) 331–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alf Önnerfors has argued that a personal element distinguishes the ''De medicamentis'' from similar medical manuals, which are in effect if not fact anonymous. In the letter to his sons, whom he addresses as ''dulcissimi'' (“my sweetest”), Marcellus expresses the hope that they and their families will, in case of sickness, find support and remedies in their father's manual, without intervention by doctors (''sine medicis intercessione''). This emphasis on self-reliance, however, is not meant to exclude others, but to empower oneself to help others; appealing to ''divina misericordia'' (“godlike compassion”), Marcellus urges his sons to extend ''caritas'' (“caring” or perhaps Christian “charity”) to strangers and the poor as well as to their loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;''De medicamentis'' prefatory epistle 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The tone, Önnerfors concludes, is “humane and full of gentle humor.”&lt;ref&gt;Alf Önnerfors, “Marcellus, ''De medicamentis'',” in ''Le latin médical'' (Université de Saint-Étienne, 1991), p. 404–405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious background==
Marcellus is usually regarded as a [[Christian]],&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, “A New Fragment of Eunapius,” p. 11; J.F. Matthews, “Gallic Supporters of Theodosius,” ''Latomus'' 30 (1971) p. 1086.&lt;/ref&gt; but he also embraces magico-medical practices that draw on the traditional  religions of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Historian of botanical pharmacology Jerry Stannard believed that evidence in the ''De medicamentis'' could neither prove nor disprove Marcellus's religious identity, noting that the few references to Christianity are “commonplace” and that, conversely, charms with references to [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|Hellenistic magic]] occur widely in medieval Christian texts.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p.  50.&lt;/ref&gt; In his classic study ''The Cult of the Saints'', [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] describes and sets out to explain what he sees as “the exclusively pagan tone of a book whose author was possibly a Christian writing for a largely [[Christianization|Christianized]] upper class.”&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, ''The Cult of the Saints: Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity'' (University of Chicago Press, 1981), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of ancient medicine Carmélia Opsomer and Robert Halleux note that in his preface, Marcellus infuses Christian concerns into the ancient tradition of “doctoring without doctors.”&lt;ref&gt;Carmélia Opsomer and Robert Halleux, “Marcellus ou le mythe empirique,” in ''Les écoles médicales à Rome'' (Geneva: Librairie Droz, 1991), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; That Marcellus was at least a nominal Christian is suggested by his appointment to high office by Theodosius I, who exerted his will to Christianize the empire by ordering the [[Roman senate]] to convert en masse.&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Barnes and R.W. Westall, “The Conversion of the Roman Aristocracy in Prudentius’ ''Contra Symmachus'',” ''Phoenix'' 45 (1991) 50–61; [[Prudentius]], ''Contra Symmachum'' 1.506–607.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Le Pilier des Nautes 01.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The Celtic god [[Esus]] (''Aisus'')]]
The internal evidence of religion in the text is meager. The phrase ''divina misericordia'' in the preface appears also in [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]’s ''[[City of God (book)|De civitate Dei]]'', where the reference to divine mercy follows immediately after a passage on barbarian incursions.&lt;ref&gt;''[[City of God (book)|De civitate Dei]]'' 1.8; barbarian incursions are a subject relevant to Marcellus, living in 4th century Gaul under threat of the Visigoths.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcellus and Augustine are contemporaries, and the use of the phrase is less a question of influence than of the currency of a shared Christian concept.&lt;ref&gt;On the interpenetration of Christianity and traditional religion and culture in the 4th century, see for instance [[Clifford Ando]], “Pagan Apologetics and Christian Intolerance in the Ages of Themistius and Augustine,” ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' 4 (1996) 171–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, passages sometimes cited as evidence of Christianity&lt;ref&gt;As by J.F. Matthews, “Gallic Supporters of Theodosius,” ''Latomus'' 30 (1971) p. 1086.&lt;/ref&gt; on closer inspection only display the [[syncretism]] of the Hellenistic magico-religious tradition, as Stannard noted. [[Christ]], for instance, is invoked in an herb-gathering incantation,&lt;ref&gt;''In nomine Christi'', ''De medicamentis 25.13.&lt;/ref&gt; but the ritual makes use of magico-medical practices of pre-Christian antiquity. A [[Judaeo-Christian]] reference — ''nomine domini Iacob, in nomine domini Sabaoth''&lt;ref&gt;''De medicamentis'' 21.2&lt;/ref&gt; — appears as part of a magic charm that the practitioner is instructed to inscribe on a ''lamella'', or metal leaf. Such [[Ephesia grammata|“magic words”]] often include nonsense syllables and more-or-less corrupt phrases from “exotic” languages such as [[Gaulish language|Celtic]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and are not indications of formal adherence to a religion.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Brashear, “The Greek Magical Papyri: ‘Voces Magicae’,” ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II, 18.5 (1995), p. 3435; see also David E. Aune, “Magic in Early Christianity: Glossolalia and ''Voces Magicae'',” reprinted in ''Apocalypticism, Prophecy and Magic in Early Christianity: Collected Essays'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reference to any religious figure in the text is [[Asclepius]], the premier god of healing among the Greeks. Marcellus alludes to a Roman version of the myth in which Asclepius restores the dismembered [[Virbius]] to wholeness; as a writer, Marcellus says, he follows a similar course of gathering the ''disiecta … membra'' ("scattered body parts") of his sources into one ''corpus'' (whole body).&lt;ref&gt;''De medicamentis'' prefatory epistle 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to gods from the [[Greek mythology|Greco-Roman pantheon]], one charm deciphered as a [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] passage has been translated to invoke the Celtic god Aisus, or [[Esus]] as it is more commonly spelled, for his aid in dispelling throat trouble.&lt;ref&gt;''De medicamentis'' 15.106, p. 121 in Niedermann; Gustav Must, “A Gaulish Incantation in Marcellus of Bordeaux,” ''Language'' 36 (1960) 193–197; Pierre-Yves Lambert, “Les formules de Marcellus de Bordeaux,” in ''La langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance 2003), p.179, citing Léon Fleuriot, “Sur quelques textes gaulois,” ''Études celtiques'' 14 (1974) 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian benefactor?===
An inscription&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' XII.5336.&lt;/ref&gt; dated 445 recognizes a Marcellus as the most important financial supporter in the rebuilding of the cathedral at Narbonne, carried out during the [[Diocese|bishopric]] of [[Rusticus of Narbonne|St. Rusticus]]. John Matthews has argued that this Marcellus is likely to have been a son or near descendant of the medical writer, since the family of an ''inlustris'' is most likely to have possessed the wealth for such a generous contribution.&lt;ref&gt;In the amount of 2,100 [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]].&lt;/ref&gt; The donor had served for two years as [[praetorian prefect]] of Gaul. Assuming that the man would have been a native, Matthews weighs this piece of evidence with the Athaulf anecdote from Orosius to situate the author of the ''De medicamentis'' in the Narbonensis,&lt;ref&gt;John Matthews, ''Western Aristocracies and Imperial Court, A.D. 364–425'' (Oxford University Press 1975), pp. 340–341, and “Gallic Supporters of Theodosius,” ''Latomus'' 30 (1971), p. 1087.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is a minority view.

==The Book of Medicaments==
Marcellus begins the ''De medicamentis liber'' by acknowledging his models. The texts he draws on include the so-called ''[[Medicina Plinii]]'' or “Medical Pliny,” the [[herbal]] (''Herbarius'') of [[Pseudo-Apuleius]], and the pharmacological treatise of [[Scribonius Largus]], as well as the most famous Latin encyclopedia from antiquity, the [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Historia naturalis]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;William D. Sharpe, “Isidore of Seville: The Medical Writings,” ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' 54 (1964), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is structured as follows:

*'''Epistolary dedication''', addressed to Marcellus's sons, a prose preface equivalent to seven paragraphs.
*'''Index medicalium scriptorum''', or [[table of contents]] for the medical topics, listing the 36 chapter headings.
*'''A short tract on [[metrology]]''',&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; with notes in Latin on [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|units of measure]] and a [[Ancient Greek units of measurement|conversion chart in Greek]].
*'''Epistulae diversorum de qualitate et observatione medicinae''' (“Letters by various authors on ‘quality’ and ‘observation’ in medicine”), a series of seven epistles, each attributed to a different medical writer. The epistles serve as a literary device for discussing methodology, diagnosis, and the importance of ethical and accurate treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p. 51, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not, or not wholly, fictional; just as Marcellus's work begins with a prefatory epistle addressed to his sons, the seven letters represent prefaces to other authors’ works, some now lost. Marcellus has detached them from the works they headed and presented them collectively, translating, sometimes taking liberties, those originally in Greek, as a kind of bonus for his sons.&lt;ref&gt;D.R. Langslow, “The ''Epistula'' in Ancient Scientific and Technical Literature, with Special Reference to Medicine,” in ''Ancient Letters: Classical and Late Antique Epistolography'', edited by Ruth Morello and A.D. Morrison (Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 218–219 and 230.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the “Letter from [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]]”, addressed to a Callistus, deals with the [[medical ethics|physician's ethical duty]] in relation to the [[Hippocratic Oath]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie André, “Du serment hippocratique à la déontologie de la médecine romaine,” ''Revue des études latines'' 83 (2005) 140–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ferula gummosa - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-205.jpg|thumb|''Ferula gummosa'', source of the ingredient galbanum]]
*'''Thirty-six chapters on treatments''', consisting mainly of recipes both pharmacological and magical, and arranged by convention anatomically ''a capite ad calcem'' (“from head to toe,” in the equivalent English expression) as were Marcellus's sources [[Scribonius Largus]] and the ''[[Medicina Plinii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment chapters run to 255 pages in Niedermann's edition. [[E.H.F. Meyer|Meyer]] lists 262 different plant names in Marcellus; allowing for synonyms, of which there are many, the number of plants mentioned would be around 131.&lt;ref&gt;[[E.H.F. Meyer]], “Geschichte der Botanik,” vol. 2 (1855) 305-315 [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10302512_00315.html (Digitalisat)], as cited by Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p. 52, note 23. Stannard finds about 350 plant names in all.&lt;/ref&gt; About 25 of the botanicals most frequently prescribed are “exotica”’ such as [[galbanum]], [[Ferula#Uses|sagapenum]], and [[ginger]]; these may have been available in Gaul as imports, but only to elite consumers. Other ingredients likely to have been rare for Marcellus’s intended audience include [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, candied [[tragacanth]], Alexandrian [[niter]], and African snails, perhaps the [[Giant African land snail]], which are prescribed live for pulping into a mélange. Availability is possibly a lesser criterion of selection for Marcellus than completeness and variety of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
*And last, the '''Carmen de speciebus''' (“Song of [[Species]]”), a 78-line Latin [[hexameter]] poem on [[pharmacolog]]y, which Marcellus contrasts to his prose assemblage of prescriptions by asserting his originality in writing it.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Formisano, “Veredelte Bäume und kultivierte Texte. Lehrgedichte in technischen Prosawerken der Spätantike,” in ''Wissensvermittlung in dichterischer Gestalt'' (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 2005), pp. 295–312, with English summary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance as medical writer==
Marcellus was a transitional figure between ancient and medieval ''[[materia medica]]''. Although the contents of the recipes — their names, uses, and methods of treatment — derive from the medical texts of [[ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greece]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Rome]], the book also points forward to doctrines and approaches characteristic of [[medieval medicine]]. Marcellus is seldom cited directly, but his influence, though perhaps not wide or pervasive, can be traced in several medieval medical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), pp. 47 and 50, also p. 53, notes 59 and 60, for extensive references.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major change in the approach to writing about botanical pharmacology is signalled in the ''De Medicamentis''. As texts associated with Mediterranean medicine traveled west and north with the expanding borders of the [[Roman empire]], the plants required by drug recipes were no longer familiar, and the descriptions or illustrations provided by earlier herbals failed to correspond to indigenous [[flora]]. Marcellus's practice of offering synonyms is one attempt to bridge this gap. He often provides a string of correspondences: the Greek plant name ''polygonos'' is first glossed as ''sanguinaria'' in Latin (1.2),&lt;ref&gt;Also ''De medicamentis'' 9.21, where ''herbae polygoni'' is equivalent to ''sanguinalis'', reiterated at 9.81.&lt;/ref&gt; then as "what we [in Gaul?] call rubia" (1.44); in the same chapter ''polygonos'' is given as another name for ''millefolium'' (1.28), and identified elsewhere as equivalent to ''verbena'' (10.5). Of the dozen or so Celtic plant names, ten are provided with or as synonyms for Greek or Latin names. A preoccupation with naming rather than description is a characteristic also of medieval herbals.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The problems of identifying plants may have been an intellectual attraction for Marcellus's [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance editor]] [[Janus Cornarius|Cornarius]], whose botanical work emphasized the value of words over illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Sachiko Kusukawa, “Leonhart Fuchs on the Importance of Pictures,” ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 58 (1997), pp. 423–426.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another medieval emphasis foreshadowed in Marcellus is a concern for locating ingredients in their native environment, replacing the exotic [[flora]] and [[fauna]] prescribed in texts from antiquity with [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous species]]. Recipes in both Marcellus and the medieval writers tend toward “polypharmacy,” or the use of a great number of ingredients in a single preparation. Many recipes in ''De medicamentis'' contain at least ten ingredients, and one, the ''antidotus Cosmiana'' (29.11), is compounded of 73.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Stannard, “Marcellus of Bordeaux and the Beginnings of the Medieval Materia Medica,” ''Pharmacy in History'' 15 (1973), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcellus is one of the likely sources for [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Bald's Leechbook|leechcraft]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid Bonser, ''The Medical Background of Anglo-Saxon England'' (1963) p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; or at least drew on the shared European magico-medical tradition that also produced [[Runic alphabet|runic]] healing: a 13th-century wooden [[amulet]] from [[Bergen]] is inscribed with a charm in [[runology|runes]] that resembles Marcellus's [[Esus|Aisus]] charm.&lt;ref&gt;Mindy LacLeod and Bernard Mees, ''Runic Amulets and Magic Objects'' (Boydell Press, 2006), pp. 117 [https://books.google.com/books?id=hx7UigqsTKoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Gaulish+writer+Marcellus%22+intitle:RUnic+intitle:amulets&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online], 139, and 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic system==

In ''The Cult of the Saints'', Peter Brown contrasts the “horizontal” or environmental healing prescribed by Marcellus to the “vertical,” authoritarian healing of his countryman and contemporary St. [[Martin of Tours]], known for [[miracle]] cures and especially [[exorcism]]. Since magic for medical purposes can be considered a form of [[faith healing]], that is also not a distinction between the two; “rich layers of folklore and superstition,” writes Brown, “lie beneath the thin veneer of Hippocratic empiricism” in Marcellus.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, ''The Cult of the Saints'' (University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does the difference lie in the social class of the intended beneficiaries, for both therapeutic systems encompassed “country folk and the common people”&lt;ref&gt;''De medicamentis,'' prefatory epistle 2, ''ab agrestibus et plebeis''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as senatorial landowners. At the Christian shrines, however, healing required submission to “socially chartered” authority;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, ''The Cult of the Saints'' (University of Chicago Press, 1981), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; in Marcellus, the patient or practitioner, often addressed directly as “you,” becomes the agent of his own cure.&lt;ref&gt;Aline Rousselle, “Du sanctuaire au thaumaturge,” ''Annales'' 31 (1976) p. 1095, as cited by Brown, ''The Cult of the Saints'', p. 116: “Il devient sujet actif de sa guérison. … L’homme est engagé, corps et esprit, dans sa propre guérison.”&lt;/ref&gt;

While the power of a saint to offer a cure resided within a particular shrine which the patient must visit, health for Marcellus lay in the interconnectivity of the patient with his environment, the use he actively made of herbs, animals, minerals, dung, language, and transformative processes such as [[emulsification]], [[calcination]] and [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. In the prefatory epistle, Marcellus insists on the efficacy of ''remedia fortuita atque simplicia'' (remedies that are readily available and act directly), despite the many recipes involving more than a dozen ingredients; in the concluding ''Carmen'', he celebrates ingredients from the far reaches of the empire and the known world (lines 41–67), emphasizing that the Roman practitioner has access to a “global” marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, ''The Cult of the Saints'' (University of Chicago Press, 1981) p. 118; Aline Rousselle, “Du sanctuaire au thaumaturge,” ''Annales'' 31 (1976) p. 1095, quoted by Brown, p. 116, refers to “une thérapie globale.”&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23911">[[Mathematical models]] can project how [[infectious diseases]] progress to show the likely outcome of an [[epidemic]] and help inform [[public health]] interventions. Models use some basic assumptions and mathematics to find [[parameter]]s for various [[infectious disease]]s and use those parameters to calculate the effects of different interventions, like mass [[vaccination]] programmes. The modelling can help in deciding which intervention/s to avoid and which to trial.

==History==

The modeling of infectious diseases is a tool which has been used to study the mechanisms by which diseases spread, to predict the future course of an outbreak and to evaluate strategies to control an epidemic.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Daley, D. J. &amp; Gani, J. (2005). ''Epidemic Modeling: An Introduction.''  NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scientist who systematically tried to quantify [[causes of death]] was [[John Graunt]] in his book ''Natural and Political Observations made upon the Bills of Mortality'', in 1662. The bills he studied were listings of numbers and causes of deaths published weekly. Graunt’s analysis of causes of death is considered the beginning of the “theory of competing risks” which according to Daley and Gani &lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; is “a theory that is now well established among modern epidemiologists”.

The earliest account of mathematical modelling of spread of disease was carried out in 1766 by [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. Trained as a physician, Bernoulli created a mathematical model to defend the practice of inoculating against [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;Hethcote, H. W. (2000). "The mathematics of infectious diseases." ''Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,'' 42, 599 – 653.&lt;/ref&gt; The calculations from this model showed that universal inoculation against smallpox would increase the [[life expectancy]] from 26 years 7 months to 29 years 9 months.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, D. &amp; Blower, S. (2004). "An attempt at a new analysis of the mortality caused by smallpox and of the advantages of inoculation to prevent it."  ''Reviews in Medical Virology'', 14, 275 – 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Bernoulli's work preceded the modern understanding of [[germ theory]].

In the early 20th century,  [[William Hamer]]&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, W. (1928). Epidemiology Old and New. London: Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ronald Ross]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Ronald|title=The Prevention of Malaria|date=1910|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001587831}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied the [[law of mass action]] to explain epidemic behaviour.

The 1920s saw the emergence of compartmental models. The [[Kermack–McKendrick theory|Kermack–McKendrick epidemic model]] (1927) and the [[Reed–Frost model|Reed–Frost epidemic model]] (1928) both describe the relationship between [[susceptible]], infected and [[immunity (medical)|immune]] individuals in a population. The Kermack–McKendrick epidemic model model was successful in predicting the behavior of outbreaks very similar to that observed in many recorded epidemics.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brauer, F. &amp; Castillo-Chávez, C. (2001).  ''Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology.''  NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
Models are only as good as the assumptions on which they are based. If a model makes predictions which are out of line with observed results and the mathematics is correct, the initial assumptions must change to make the model useful.
* Rectangular and stationary [[Population pyramid|age distribution]], i.e., everybody in the population lives to age ''L'' and then dies, and for each age (up to ''L'') there is the same number of people in the population. This is often well-justified for developed countries where there is a low infant mortality and much of the population lives to the life expectancy.
* Homogeneous mixing of the population, i.e., individuals of the population under scrutiny assort and [[transmission risks and rates|make contact]] at random and do not mix mostly in a smaller subgroup. This assumption is rarely justified because [[social structure]] is widespread. For example, most people in London only make contact with other Londoners. Further, within London then there are smaller subgroups, such as the Turkish community or teenagers (just to give two examples), who mix with each other more than people outside their group. However, homogeneous mixing is a standard assumption to make the mathematics tractable.

==Types of epidemic models==
===Stochastic===
"Stochastic" means being or having a random variable. A stochastic model is a tool for estimating probability distributions of potential outcomes by allowing for random variation in one or more inputs over time. Stochastic models depend on the chance variations in risk of exposure, disease and other illness dynamics.

===Deterministic===
When dealing with large populations, as in the case of tuberculosis, deterministic or compartmental mathematical models are often used.  In a deterministic model, individuals in the population are assigned to different subgroups or compartments, each representing a specific stage of the epidemic.  Letters such as M, S, E, I, and R are often used to represent different stages.  
 
The transition rates from one class to another are mathematically expressed as derivatives, hence the model is formulated using differential equations.  While building such models, it must be assumed that the population size in a compartment is differentiable with respect to time and that the epidemic process is deterministic. In other words, the changes in population of a compartment can be calculated using only the history that was used to develop the model.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Reproduction number ==
{{main|Basic reproduction number}}The ''basic reproduction number (''denoted by ''R&lt;sub href="Next-generation matrix"&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)'' is a measure of how transferrable a disease is. It is the average number of people that a single infectious person will infect over the course of their infection. This quantity determines whether the infection will spread exponentially, die out, or remain constant: if ''R&lt;sub href="Next-generation matrix"&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 1, then each person on average infects more than one other person so the disease will spread; if ''R&lt;sub href="Next-generation matrix"&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; 1, then each person infects less than one person on average so the disease will die out; and if ''R&lt;sub href="Next-generation matrix"&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1, then each person will infect exactly one other person, so the disease will become ''endemic:'' it will move throughout the population but not increase or decrease.

The basic reproduction number can be computed as a ratio of known rates over time: if an infectious individual contacts β other people per unit time, if all of those people are assumed to contract the disease, and if the disease has a mean infectious period of 1/γ, then the basic reproduction number is just ''R''&lt;sub href="Transmission risks and rates"&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''&amp;#x3B2;''/''&amp;#x3B3;''.  Some diseases have multiple possible latency periods, in which case the reproduction number for the disease overall is the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease.  For example, Blower et al.&lt;ref&gt;Blower, S. M., Mclean, A. R., Porco, T. C., Small, P. M., Hopewell, P. C., Sanchez, M. A., et al. (1995). "The intrinsic transmission dynamics of tuberculosis epidemics."  ''Nature Medicine'', 1, 815–821.&lt;/ref&gt; model two forms of tuberculosis infection: in the fast case, the symptoms show up immediately after exposure; in the slow case, the symptoms develop years after the initial exposure (endogenous reactivation). The overall reproduction number is the sum of the two forms of contraction: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;FAST&lt;/sup&gt; + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;SLOW&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Endemic steady state==
An infectious disease is said to be [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] when it can be sustained in a population without the need for external inputs. This means that, on average, each infected person is infecting ''exactly'' one other person (any more and the number of people infected will [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]] and there will be an [[epidemic]], any less and the disease will die out). In mathematical terms, that is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\ R_0 \ = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[basic reproduction number]] (''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of the disease, assuming everyone is susceptible, multiplied by the proportion of the population that is actually susceptible (''S'') must be one (since those who are not susceptible do not feature in our calculations as they cannot contract the disease). Notice that this relation means that for a disease to be in the [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] [[steady state]], the higher the basic reproduction number, the lower the proportion of the population susceptible must be, and vice versa.

Assume the rectangular stationary age distribution and let also the ages of infection have the same distribution for each birth year. Let the average age of infection be ''A'', for instance when individuals younger than ''A'' are susceptible and those older than ''A'' are immune (or infectious). Then it can be shown by an easy argument that the proportion of the population that is susceptible is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;
S = \frac{A}{L}.
&lt;/math&gt;

But the mathematical definition of the endemic steady state can be rearranged to give:

: &lt;math&gt;
S = \frac {1} {R_0}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, due to the [[transitive property]]:

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac {1} {R_0} = \frac {A} {L} \Rightarrow R_0 = \frac {L} {A}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This provides a simple way to estimate the parameter ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; using easily available data.

For a population with an [[population pyramid|exponential age distribution]],

: &lt;math&gt;
R_0 = 1 + \frac {L} {A}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This allows for the basic reproduction number of a disease given ''A'' and ''L'' in either type of population distribution.

== Modelling epidemics ==
{{Main|Compartmental models in epidemiology}}The SIR model is one of the more basic models used for modelling epidemics. There are a large number of modifications to the model.

=== The SIR model ===
In 1927, W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick created a model in which they considered a fixed population with only three compartments: susceptible, &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt;; infected, &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt;; and removed, &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The compartments used for this model consist of three classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=McKendrick|first2=A. G.|year=1927|title=A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=115|issue=772|pages=700|bibcode=1927RSPSA.115..700K|doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0118|jstor=94815|pmc=|pmid=|last1=Kermack|first1=W. O.|authorlink2=Anderson Gray McKendrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; is used to represent the number of individuals not yet infected with the disease at time t, or those susceptible to the disease.
* &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of individuals who have been infected with the disease and are capable of spreading the disease to those in the susceptible category.
* &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the compartment used for those individuals who have been infected and then removed from the disease, either due to immunization or due to death. Those in this category are not able to be infected again or to transmit the infection to others.
The flow of this model may be considered as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Using a fixed population, &lt;math&gt;N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t)&lt;/math&gt;, Kermack and McKendrick derived the following equations:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta S I}{N} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta S I}{N} - \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;

Several assumptions were made in the formulation of these equations: First, an individual in the population must be considered as having an equal probability as every other individual of contracting the disease with a rate of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, which is considered the contact or infection rate of the disease.  Therefore, an infected individual makes contact and is able to transmit the disease with &lt;math&gt;\beta N&lt;/math&gt; others per unit time and the fraction of contacts by an infected with a susceptible is &lt;math&gt;S/N&lt;/math&gt;. The number of new infections in unit time per infective then is &lt;math&gt;\beta N (S/N)&lt;/math&gt;, giving the rate of new infections (or those leaving the susceptible category) as &lt;math&gt;\beta N (S/N)I = \beta SI&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For the second and third equations, consider the population leaving the susceptible class as equal to the number entering the infected class. However, a number equal to the fraction (&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; which represents the mean recovery/death rate, or &lt;math&gt;1/\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the mean infective period) of infectives are leaving this class per unit time to enter the removed class. These processes which occur simultaneously are referred to as the Law of Mass Action, a widely accepted idea that the rate of contact between two groups in a population is proportional to the size of each of the groups concerned.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Finally, it is assumed that the rate of infection and recovery is much faster than the time scale of births and deaths and therefore, these factors are ignored in this model.

=== Steady state solutions ===
The expected duration of susceptibility will be&lt;math display="inline"&gt;E[min(T_L|T_S)] &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T_L &lt;/math&gt;reflects the time alive (life expectancy) and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T_S &lt;/math&gt;reflects the time in the susceptible state before becoming infected, which can be simplified&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Infectious-Diseases-Humans-Dynamics-Control/dp/019854040X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532296195&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=anderson+and+may+infectious+diseases+of+humans|title=Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control|last=results|first=search|last2=May|first2=Robert M.|last3=Anderson|first3=B.|date=1992-09-24|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198540403|edition= Revised|location=Oxford|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; to:

&lt;math&gt;E[min(T_L|T_S)]=\int_0^\inf[exp^{-(\mu+\delta)} = \frac{1}{\mu+\delta} &lt;/math&gt;,

such that the number of susceptible persons is the number entering the susceptible compartment &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mu N &lt;/math&gt;times the duration of susceptibility:

&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{\mu N}{\mu + \lambda} &lt;/math&gt;.

Analogously, the steady-state number of infected persons is the number entering the infected state from the susceptible state (number susceptible, times rate of infection &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lambda = \frac{\beta I}{N} &lt;/math&gt;, times the duration of infectiousness &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{1}{\mu+v} &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\mu N}{\mu + \lambda} \lambda \frac{1}{\mu + v} &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Other compartmental models ===
There are a large number of modifications of the SIR model, including those that include births and deaths, where upon recovery there is no immunity (SIS model), where immunity lasts only for a short period of time (SIRS), where there is a latent period of the disease where the person is not infectious (SEIS and SEIR), and where infants can be born with immunity (MSIR).

==Infectious disease dynamics==

Mathematical models need to integrate the increasing volume of [[Numerical data|data]] being generated on [[Host (biology)|host]]-[[pathogen]] interactions. Many theoretical studies of the [[population dynamics]], structure and evolution of [[infectious disease]]s of [[plants]] and animals, including humans, are concerned with this problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Research topics include:

* [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]], spread and control of infection
* [[epidemiological]] networks
* [[spatial epidemiology]]
* persistence of pathogens within hosts
* intra-host dynamics
* [[immune system|immuno]]-epidemiology
* [[virulence]]
* [[Strain (biology)]] structure and interactions
* [[antigenic shift]]
* [[phylodynamics]]
* pathogen [[population genetics]]
* [[evolution]] and spread of [[drug resistance|resistance]]
* role of host genetic factors
* statistical and mathematical tools and innovations
* role and identification of [[infection reservoir]]s

==Mathematics of mass vaccination==
If the proportion of the population that is immune exceeds the [[herd immunity]] level for the disease, then the disease can no longer persist in the population. Thus, if this level can be exceeded by vaccination, the disease can be eliminated. An example of this being successfully achieved worldwide is the global [[smallpox eradication]], with the last wild case in 1977. The [[WHO]] is carrying out a similar [[poliomyelitis eradication|vaccination campaign to eradicate polio]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The herd immunity level will be denoted ''q''. Recall that, for a stable state:

: &lt;math&gt;
\ R_0 \cdot S = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;
:In turn,
:&lt;math&gt;
R_0=\frac{N}{S} = \frac{\mu N E(T_L)}{\mu N E[min(T_L,T_S)} = \frac{E(T_L)}{E[min(T_L, T_S)]}
&lt;/math&gt;, which is approximately:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{E(T_L)}{E(T_S)} = 1+\frac{\lambda}{\mu} = \frac{\beta N }{v}
&lt;/math&gt;.

''S'' will be (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''q''), since ''q'' is the proportion of the population that is immune and ''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''S'' must equal one  (since in this simplified model, everyone is either susceptible or immune). Then:

: &lt;math&gt; \ R_0 \cdot (1-q) = 1, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; 1-q = \frac {1} {R_0}, &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; q = 1 - \frac {1} {R_0}. &lt;/math&gt;

Remember that this is the threshold level. If the proportion of immune individuals ''exceeds'' this level due to a mass vaccination programme, the disease will die out.

We have just calculated the '''critical immunisation threshold''' (denoted ''q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''). It is the minimum proportion of the population that must be immunised at birth (or close to birth) in order for the infection to die out in the population.

: &lt;math&gt; q_c = 1 - \frac {1} {R_0} &lt;/math&gt;.
:Because the fraction of the final size of the population ''p'' that is never infected can be defined as:
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{t-&gt;\inf} S(t) = \exp^{-\int_{0}^{\inf} {\lambda(t) dt}} = 1-p &lt;/math&gt;.
:Hence,
:&lt;math&gt; p = 1- \exp^{-\int_{0}^{\inf} {\beta I(t) dt}} = 1-\exp^{-R_0 p} &lt;/math&gt;.
:Solving for &lt;math&gt;
\ R_0 
&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain:
:&lt;math&gt; {R_0} = \frac{-ln(1-p)}{p} &lt;/math&gt;.
:

===When mass vaccination cannot exceed the herd immunity===
If the vaccine used is insufficiently effective or the required coverage cannot be reached (for example due to [[MMR vaccine controversy|popular resistance]]), the programme may fail to exceed ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;. Such a programme can, however, disturb the balance of the infection without eliminating it, often causing unforeseen problems.

Suppose that a proportion of the population ''q'' (where ''q'' &lt; ''q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'') is immunised at birth against an infection with ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;1. The [[vaccination]] programme changes ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; where

: &lt;math&gt;
\ R_q = R_0(1-q)
&lt;/math&gt;

This change occurs simply because there are now fewer susceptibles in the population who can be infected. R&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; is simply R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; minus those that would normally be infected but that cannot be now since they are immune.

As a consequence of this lower [[basic reproduction number]], the average age of infection ''A'' will also change to some new value ''A''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; in those who have been left unvaccinated.

Recall the relation that linked R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A'' and ''L''. Assuming that life expectancy has not changed, now:

: &lt;math&gt;\ R_q = \frac {L} {A_q},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\ A_q = \frac {L} {R_q} = \frac {L} {R_0(1-q)}.&lt;/math&gt;

But ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''/''A'' so:

: &lt;math&gt;\ {A_q} = \frac {L} {(L/A)(1-q)} = \frac {AL} {L(1-q)} = \frac {A} {1-q}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the vaccination programme will raise the average age of infection, another mathematical justification for a result that might have been intuitively obvious. Unvaccinated individuals now experience a reduced [[force of infection]] due to the presence of the vaccinated group.

However, it is important to consider this effect when vaccinating against diseases that are more severe in older people. A vaccination programme against such a disease that does not exceed ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; may cause more deaths and complications than there were before the programme was brought into force as individuals will be catching the disease later in life. These unforeseen outcomes of a vaccination programme are called '''perverse effects'''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===When mass vaccination exceeds the herd immunity===
If a vaccination programme causes the proportion of immune individuals in a population to exceed the critical threshold for a significant length of time, transmission of the infectious disease in that population will stop. This is known as elimination of the infection and is different from [[Disease eradication|eradication]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

; Elimination
: Interruption of endemic transmission of an infectious disease, which occurs if each infected individual infects less than one other, is achieved by maintaining vaccination coverage to keep the proportion of immune individuals above the critical immunisation threshold.
; Eradication
: Reduction of infective organisms in the wild worldwide to zero. So far, this has only been achieved for [[smallpox]] and [[rinderpest]]. To get to eradication, elimination in all world regions must be achieved.

[[The Venerable]] '''Matt Talbot''', [[Secular Franciscan Order|OFS]] (2 May 1856 – 7 June 1925) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Asceticism|ascetic]] revered by many [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] for his [[piety]], [[charity (virtue)|charity]] and [[mortification of the flesh]].

Talbot was an [[Manual labour|unskilled labourer]]. Though he lived alone for most of his life, Talbot did live with his mother for a time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/Mountjoy/Rutland_Street__Upper/23750/ 1911 Census of Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;  His life would have gone unnoticed were it not for the cords and chains discovered on his body when he died suddenly on a Dublin street in 1925.

Though he has not been formally recognized as a saint, Talbot may be considered a patron of those struggling with alcoholism.&lt;ref name=foley&gt;Leonard Foley OFM, "Venerable Matt Talbot", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qzIPgAACAAJ Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast]'', (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media, {{ISBN|978-0-86716-887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Miller OFM, [https://www.franciscanmedia.org/venerable-matt-talbot/ "Venerable Matt Talbot"], Franciscan Media&lt;/ref&gt; He is commemorated on 19 June.&lt;ref name=lapointe&gt;[http://www.conncoll.edu/images/content/Matt_Talbot.pdf LaPointe, Fr. Larry, "Matt Talbot", Connecticut College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901090504/http://www.conncoll.edu/images/content/Matt_Talbot.pdf |date=1 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life – alcoholism==
Talbot was born on 2 May 1856 at 13 Aldborough Court, [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]],&lt;ref name=diocese&gt;[http://www.matttalbot.ie/index.htm "Matt Talbot", Diocese of Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt; the second eldest of twelve children of Charles and Elizabeth Talbot,  a poor family in the [[North Strand]] area. He was baptised in St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral on 5 May.&lt;ref name=pro&gt;[http://www.procathedral.ie/matt-talbot "Venerable Matt Talbot, 1856 – 1925", [[St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral]], Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt; His father and all but the oldest of his brothers were heavy drinkers. In 1868 Matt left school at the age of twelve and went to work in a wine merchant's store. He very soon began "sampling their wares", and was considered a hopeless alcoholic by age thirteen.&lt;ref name=atlanta&gt;[http://www.archatl.com/ministries/disabilities/saints/saint_info.php?0=June+19&amp;feast_date=June+19&amp;1=Venerable+Matt+Talbot&amp;full_name=Venerable+Matt+Talbot&amp;2=Alcoholics&amp;patronage=Alcoholics "Venerable Matt Talbot (Patron of Struggling and Recovering Addicts and Alcoholics)", Archdiocese of Atlanta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095740/http://www.archatl.com/ministries/disabilities/saints/saint_info.php?0=June+19&amp;feast_date=June+19&amp;1=Venerable+Matt+Talbot&amp;full_name=Venerable+Matt+Talbot&amp;2=Alcoholics&amp;patronage=Alcoholics |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to the Port &amp; Docks Board where he worked in the whiskey stores. He frequented pubs in the city with his brothers and friends, spending most or all of his wages and running up debts.&lt;ref name=mattt&gt;{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillan|isbn= 0-7171-2945-4|page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his wages were spent, he borrowed and scrounged for money. He pawned his clothes and boots to get money for alcohol. On one occasion, he stole a [[fiddle]] from a [[busking|street entertainer]] and sold it to buy drink.&lt;ref name=atlanta/&gt;

=="Taking the pledge"==
One evening in 1884 28-year old Talbot, who was penniless and out of credit, waited outside  a pub in the hope that somebody would invite him in for a drink.  After several friends had passed him without offering to treat him, he went home in disgust and announced to his mother that he was going to "take [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)#Total Abstinence Society|the pledge]]" (renounce drink). He went to [[Holy Cross College (Dublin)|Holy Cross College]], [[Clonliffe]] where he took the pledge for three months. At the end of the three months, he took the pledge for six months, then for life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pioneertotal.ie/pioneer/images/matt.jpg Talbot's pledge certificate from the "Total Abstinence League of Sacred Heart", 4 May 1890]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having drunk excessively for 16 years, Talbot maintained sobriety for the following forty years of his life. There is evidence that Matt’s first seven years after taking the pledge were especially difficult.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt; He found strength in prayer, began to attend daily Mass, and read religious books and pamphlets. He repaid all his debts scrupulously. Having searched for the fiddler whose instrument he had stolen, and failed to find him, he gave the money to the church to have [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] said for him.

==Working life==
Even when his drinking was at its worst, Talbot was a hard worker. When he joined Pembertons, the building contractors, as a [[Brick hod|hod]]-carrier, his work-rate was such that he was put first on the line of hodmen to set the pace.  Later, in Martin's  timber yard, he took on the meanest and hardest jobs. He was respectful to his bosses but not obsequious, and on occasion stood up for a fellow-worker.  On 22 September 1911 Talbot joined the builder's labourers branch of the [[Irish Transport and General Workers Union]].  When the [[Dublin Lockout]] of 1913 led to [[sympathy strike]]s throughout the city, the men of Martin's, including Talbot, came out.&lt;ref name="mattt"/&gt;   At first Talbot refused his strike pay, saying that he had not earned it. Later he accepted it but asked that it be shared out among the other strikers.  After his death a rumour was put about that he was a strike-breaker in 1913, but all the evidence contradicts this.

==Spirituality==
[[File:Matt Talbot.JPG|thumb|200px|Statue of Talbot near Dublin's [[Talbot Memorial Bridge]].]]
From being an indifferent Catholic in his drinking days, Talbot became increasingly devout.  He lived a life of prayer, fasting, and service, trying to model himself on the sixth century Irish monks.&lt;ref name=atlanta/&gt; He was guided for most of his life by Dr. Michael Hickey, Professor of Philosophy in [[Clonliffe College]].  Under Dr. Hickey's guidance Talbot's reading became wider. He read laboriously Scripture, lives of saints, ''The Confessions of St. Augustine'', and writings of St. Francis de Sales and others. When he found a part difficult to understand, he asked a priest to clarify it.&lt;ref name=atlanta/&gt;

Dr. Hickey also gave him a light chain, (much like a clock chain), to wear as a form of [[penance]].&lt;ref name=atlanta/&gt; He became a [[Third Order]] [[Franciscan]] in  1890 and was a member of several other associations and [[Sodality|sodalities]].&lt;ref name="mattt"/&gt; Talbot was a generous man. Although poor himself, he gave unstintingly to neighbours and fellow workers, to charitable institutions and the church. He ate very little. After his mother's death in 1915 he lived in a small flat with very little furniture. He slept on a plank bed with a piece of timber for a pillow. He rose at 5 a.m. every day so as to attend Mass before work. At work, whenever he had spare time, he found a quiet place to pray. He spent most of every evening on his knees. On Sundays he attended several Masses. He walked quickly, with his head down, so that he appeared to be hurrying from one Mass to another.

==Death and veneration==
Talbot was on his way to Mass on Trinity Sunday, 7 June 1925, when he collapsed and died of [[congestive heart failure|heart failure]] on Granby Lane in Dublin. Nobody at the scene was able to identify him. His body was taken to Jervis Street Hospital, where he was undressed, revealing the extent of his austerities. A chain had been wound around his waist, with more chains around an arm and a leg, and cords around the other arm and leg.&lt;ref name="mattt"/&gt; The chains found on his body at death were not some extreme penitential regime but a symbol of his devotion to Mary, Mother of God that he wished to give himself to her totally as a slave.&lt;ref name=bishops&gt;[http://irishbishopsdrugsinitiative.com/?page_id=235 "Matt Talbot", Irish Bishop's Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot's story quickly filtered through the community and there were many spectators when his funeral took place at [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] on 11 June 1925. In 1972 his remains were removed to a tomb in Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Sean McDermott Street, Dublin, in the area where Matt spent his life.&lt;ref name=bishops/&gt;

On 6 November 1931, Archbishop Byrne of Dublin opened a sworn inquiry into the alleged claims of holiness of the former dock worker. The Apostolic Process, the official sworn inquiry at the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]], began in 1947. On 3 October 1975 [[Pope Paul VI]] declared him to be [[Venerable]] Matt Talbot, which is a step on the road to his [[canonisation]], a process which needs evidence of a physical miracle in order to be successful.&lt;ref name="mattt"/&gt; There is a particular devotion to Matt Talbot among some North American Roman Catholics&lt;ref name=bishops/&gt; among those involved in a ministry to achieve or maintain sobriety.

A possible miracle in Kansas, where a healthy child was delivered despite tests showing abnormalities—[[Down syndrome]] or [[cystic fibrosis]]—after his aunt organized a prayer chain asking the intercession of Matt Talbot, is currently under investigation. If shown to be "medically inexplicable", the case may bring Talbot a step closer to sainthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gargan|first1=Mags|title=New 'miracle' may put Matt Talbot on road to sainthood|url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/new-miracle-may-put-matt-talbot-road-sainthood|accessdate=27 February 2015|work=The Irish Catholic|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:The Custom House and Matt Talbot Memorial Bridge from City Quay - geograph.org.uk - 1733696.jpg|thumb|left|The Custom House and Matt Talbot Memorial Bridge from City Quay]]

''“Never be too hard on the man who can’t give up drink. It’s as hard to give up the drink as it is to raise the dead to life again. But both are possible and even easy for Our Lord. We have only to depend on him.” – Matt Talbot''&lt;ref name=lapointe/&gt;

As word of Matt Talbot spread he rapidly became an icon for Ireland's temperance movement, the [[Pioneer Total Abstinence Association]]. His story soon became known to the large Irish emigrant communities. Many addiction clinics, youth hostels and statues have been named after him throughout the world from [[Nebraska]] to [[Warsaw]] to [[Sydney]]. One of Dublin's main bridges is also [[Talbot Memorial Bridge|named after him]]. A statue of Talbot was erected at [[Sir John Rogerson's Quay]] in 1988. [[Pope John Paul II]], as a young man, wrote a paper on him.

[[Graham Linehan]] has stated that the character of [[Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading|Matty Hislop]] in his comedy series ''[[Father Ted]]'' was based on Talbot.&lt;ref&gt;Writer's commentary to 'Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading', ''Father Ted – The Definitive Collection'', 2 Entertain Video, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Talbot's remains were removed from Glasnevin Cemetery to Our Lady of Lourdes Church on Seán McDermott Street, Dublin, in 1972. The tomb has a glass panel through which the coffin may be seen.

There is a small plaque in Granby Lane at the site of Matt Talbot's death.

'''Measure B''', also known as the '''''County of Los Angeles Safer Sex In the Adult Film Industry Act''','' is the law that requires the use of [[condom]]s in all [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]] and [[Anal sex|anal]] sex scenes in [[pornography]] productions filmed in [[Los Angeles County]], California. The measure also requires porn production companies to obtain a health permit prior to production and to post the permit and a notice to performers regarding condom use during production. All individuals involved will also be required to pay $1,600 every 2 years.&lt;ref name=LWVCA121217&gt;{{cite web |title=Measure B: Safer Sex In the Adult Film Industry Act - County of Los Angeles |url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2012/11/06/ca/la/meas/B/ |publisher=League of Women Voters of California Education Fund |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2009 similar legislation was introduced at the [[California|State]] level. Citing an HIV positive test for a performer in May of that year, the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]] sought to find a sponsor for a bill to mandate condom use in adult films. They had originally approved a resolution to seek legislation in October 2008, and made it part of their official state legislative agenda in December.&lt;ref name=StateCondom&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=L.A. pushes for condoms in porn legislation, but state lawmakers balk|url=http://capitolweekly.net/l-a-pushes-for-condoms-in-porn-legislation-but-state-lawmakers-balk/|publisher=Capitol Weekly|accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary testing center at the time was the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]] (AIM). Prior to this, in 2004, there were several related cases of HIV positive tests reported. Of the twenty-two reported cases roughly half were among men who work in gay films, while the rest were both men and women working in heterosexual productions.&lt;ref name=StateCondom/&gt;

Measure B was voted on November 6, 2012 and passed with 55.9% of the vote.&lt;ref name=LAT121107-1&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 7, 2012 |title=Condom requirement for porn filming approved by voters |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/condom-requirement-for-porn-filming-approved-by-voters.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location= |accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT121107-2&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 7, 2012 |title=Porn industry trade group vows to fight condom requirement |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/porn-industry-trade-group-plans-to-fight-condom-decision.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==

===Support===
In 2012 proponents gathered 372,000 voter signatures through a citizens' initiative in Los Angeles County to put Measure B on the 2012 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = https://apha.confex.com/apha/141am/webprogram/Paper282652.html | title = Successful advocacy for condoms in adult films: from idea to ballot, how did we do it? | first = Mark | last = McGrath | date = November 5, 2013 | conference = 141st Annual Meeting and Expo November 2–6, 2013, Boston, Massachusetts | conference-url = https://apha.confex.com/apha/141am/webprogram/start.html | publisher = [[American Public Health Association]] | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = Paper no. 282652 | access-date = 9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Measure B said it would stop the spread of [[STDs in the porn industry]] and protect tax dollars.&lt;ref name=YesOnB&gt;{{cite web |title=Vote Yes On B |url=http://www.yesonb.info/ |publisher= [[Los Angeles County Medical Association]] |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029100926/http://www.yesonb.info/ |archivedate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She said they cause friction burns vaginally and anally, that they slip off and rip, and that they get stuck inside. "They aren't built to withstand our shoots," she said. [[Stoya]], another female performer in adult films, said, "If you condense the amount of time we were actually having sex, it probably added up to almost four to five hours."&lt;ref name=HuffCondom&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Mitchell |title=How a straight adult performer convinced me that condoms are useless in porn |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mitchell-williams/how-a-straight-adult-performer-convinced-me-that-condoms-are-useless-in-porn_b_2165066.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | publisher= [[AOL]] |accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical opposition===
In January 2014, [[Falcon Entertainment]] countered the ban after its passing by using [[post-production]] editing to remove the condoms from footage in its film ''California Dreamin' 1''; the edits were intentional, as the film was intended to reflect the "carefree and spontaneous" style of the 1970s and 80s.&lt;ref name=Opam140120&gt;{{cite web |last=Opam |first=Kwame |date=January 20, 2014 |title=Porn studio digitally removes condoms from release to provide 'pre-condom fantasy' |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/20/5327506/porn-studio-digitally-removes-condoms-from-releases-to-provide-pre |work=The Verge |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary===
In her first column for the [[OC Weekly]], performer [[Tasha Reign]] reiterated Hartley and Stoya's comments regarding the impracticality of imposing condoms on the industry. Reign said, "Want to know a dirty secret that Measure B proponents, who say what they did was in the interest of us supposedly helpless performers, never brought up? After hours of sex with no breaks, attempting to endure the friction of the condom in your vagina or anus is...impossible. And to do this daily amounts to an occupational work hazard. Of course, due to the lack of respect towards the adult business and blatant disregard from society regarding the sexual comfort or even opinions of female performers, none of this mattered. No one asked us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reign|first=Tasha|authorlink=Tasha Reign|title=Tasha Tells All...On LA County's Measure B Condom Law|url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/navelgazing/2013/04/tasha_tells_measure_b.php|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=[[OC Weekly]]|date=April 8, 2013 &lt;!-- at 7:30 AM --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, [[Vivid Entertainment]] CEO [[Steven Hirsch]] and pornographic actors Dahlia Sky, [[Penny Pax]], Veruca James, [[Steven St. Croix]] and Michael Vegas appeared in a video titled "Thank You From the Porn Industry" for [[Funny or Die]].

===Industry exodus from Los Angeles County===
;2013
Industry and agency officials say there has been a shift in where porn is made, and estimated the potential economic impact at US$6 billion.&lt;ref name=2014LVSun/&gt; In November 2013, [[Diane Duke]], executive director of industry trade group [[Free Speech Coalition]], said, "Fewer people are shooting (adult film) in L.A. County, and some have moved to other areas around California or other states...".&lt;ref name=1YR&gt;{{cite news |last=Abram |first=Susan |date=November 4, 2013 |title=One year later, condoms-in-porn law reshapes industry in L.A.

But what it also gives to Las Vegas is that it's building technical capacity that undergirds non-pornographic production and media. It adds some competitive advantage in scale to Los Angeles."&lt;ref name=2014LVSun/&gt;

In the months after the measure passed, production companies began seeking shooting locations outside of Los Angeles County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press|last=|title=Camarillo, Calif. Porn Film Moratorium Passed After Deluge Of Film Permit Requests|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/28/camarillo-porn-film-moratorium_n_2973642.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ventura County]] city of [[Camarillo, CA]], the [[city council]] passed a forty-five-day [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on the issuance of [[film permits]], including special-event and conditional-use permits, for porn productions due to the increased number of applications.&lt;ref name=VCSPornPermit&gt;{{cite news|last=Letzer|first=Jennifer|title=Camarillo council places moratorium on porn movie production|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2013/mar/28/council-places-moratorium-on-pornographic-film/|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=March 28, 2013 &lt;!--9:14 p.m.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the passing of the measure, it was reported that prior to Measure B typically up to 500 permits would be applied for in Los Angeles County with [[FilmL.A.]], the nonprofit that processes permits for motion picture, television and commercial productions. In 2013, applications were received for twenty-four permits.&lt;ref name=LADN1YR&gt;{{cite news|last=Abram|first=Susan|title=Porn industry to gather in Los Angeles for annual conference|url=http://www.dailynews.com/arts-and-entertainment/20140120/porn-industry-to-gather-in-los-angeles-for-annual-conference|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|date=January 20, 2014 &lt;!--9:27 PM PST--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman with the county's Department of Public Health said that eleven health permits were requested by adult-film studios.

;2014
One of the industry's largest producers, [[Vivid Entertainment]], has gone outside Los Angeles County since the law took effect. Co-founder [[Steven Hirsch]] said, "We will not be shooting in L.A. under the current situation, which is too bad," "There's a uniqueness to L.A. you can't find anywhere such as backdrops. It's also impacted us financially because shooting outside the county can become more expensive." Some production moved to [[Las Vegas]] citing a more favorable environment.&lt;ref name=Aftermath&gt;{{cite news|last=Dreier|first=Hanna|title=Condom law aftermath: Porn production booms in Las Vegas after move from San Fernando Valley|url=http://www.dailynews.com/arts-and-entertainment/20140117/condom-law-aftermath-porn-production-booms-in-las-vegas-after-move-from-san-fernando-valley|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|date=January 17, 2014 &lt;!--9:25 AM PST--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], where Las Vegas is located, does not require health permits and gives out location licenses for a nominal fee; filming permits in Los Angeles County can cost hundreds of dollars.&lt;ref name=Aftermath/&gt;

In September 2014, the ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' featured an article about the adult industry's possible relocation from Southern California to Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=2014LVSun&gt;{{cite news|last1=Domanick|first1=Andrea|title=Porn Wars: Is Las Vegas the new Silicone Valley?|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/sep/21/porn-las-vegas-condom-kink-illegal-film-aids-healt/|accessdate=September 24, 2014|publisher=Las Vegas Sun newspaper|date=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to commentary by ''AVN'' magazine's political analyst Mark Kernes, the author of the ''Sun'' article, Andrea Domanick, "manages to make a few good points—and snags some quotes from [[Kink.com]] CEO Peter Acworth".&lt;ref name=2014AVN-LVSun&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kernes|first1=Mark|title=New Article in Las Vegas Sun Catches Up With Porn's Reality|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/New-Article-in-Las-Vegas-Sun-Catches-Up-With-Porn-s-Reality-573647.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article Acworth is quoted as saying, "Vegas is looking more and more attractive as time goes by... I think that a lot of companies are doing what we're doing. They're setting up satellite offices and getting their feet wet with Vegas as a potential place to shoot. The move is happening, but quietly. They don't want a target on their back."&lt;ref name=2014LVSun/&gt; Acworth had announced several weeks earlier that he was shopping for office/production space in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=2014AVN-LVSun/&gt; The article also mentions the ease of production relative to California by stating that Nevada requires film permits only for specific locations and conditions. It states, "Shooting on private property, frequently the choice of porn producers, requires no permit or notification, and the state has no explicit regulations about condom use."&lt;ref name=2014LVSun/&gt; The article also quotes a technician with knowledge of the mainstream film industry in Southern California and Nevada. Jim Reid of JR Lighting, one of Nevada's largest production rental companies stated, "A lot of people I know in the mainstream industry started out in the adult industry in California. It's a very good training ground."&lt;ref name=2014LVSun/&gt;

In December, after the ruling of the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] regarding the measure, it was announced that applications for permits for pornographic productions has reduced by 95%.&lt;ref name=20149thNo/&gt;

===State legislation - AB1576===
On January 30, 2014 California Assemblyperson [[Isadore Hall]] ([[California Democratic Party|D]] – [[Compton, California|Compton]], 64th District) introduced Assembly Bill 1576.&lt;ref name=AB1576Text&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=AB1576|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_1551-1600/ab_1576_bill_20140130_introduced.html|website=legalinfo.ca.gov|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like its failed predecessor, AB640 in 2013 (also introduced by Hall),&lt;ref name=AB640-2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Aseembly Bill 640 (2013)|url=http://openstates.org/ca/bills/20132014/AB640/|website=openstates.org|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bill is a statewide version of Measure B that affects Los Angeles County only and makes it a criminal offense to violate its provisions.&lt;ref name=2014AB1576Tracking&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=AB1576|url=http://www.legtrack.com/bill.html?bill=201320140AB1576|website=www.legtrack.com|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also imposes a controversial government mandate on testing, forcing producers to disclose performers' [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]] test details to the [[California Department of Industrial Relations|Department of Industrial Relations]].&lt;ref name=Stop1576&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Stop1576|url=http://www.ab1576.org/|website=www.ab1576.org|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2014 the bill has passed through the Labor and Employment (04/01/14), ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS, TOURISM, AND INTERNET MEDIA (04/28/14), APPROPRIATIONS (05/20/14), and ASSEMBLY FLOOR ANALYSIS (5/22/14) committees.&lt;ref name=2014AB1576Tracking/&gt;

In June five adult actresses met with Hall's district director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his "condoms in porn" bill. At the meeting with Hutt were adult film actresses [[Nina Hartley]], Alex Chance and [[Anikka Albrite]], along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist who has been working with [[Free Speech Coalition]] (FSC) and [[Kink.com]] on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill and the fact that it had been created with no input from adult industry representatives.&lt;ref name=2014AVN1576Petition&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kernes|first1=Mark|title=Adult Actresses Deliver Petitions to Isadore Hall Office-UPDATED|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/Adult-Actresses-Deliver-Petitions-to-Isadore-Hall-Office-UPDATED-564968.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[AVN magazine]], Chance stated the following,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We told [Hutt] we have our own self-regulation..." "We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea." "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," Chance added. "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, and she had no idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea.&lt;ref name=2014AVN1576Petition/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the thirty-five minute meeting Director Hutt mentioned that in the 2012 election the most votes cast in any district in favor of passage of Measure B came from Hall's district. Actress Nina Hartley countered that although Measure B and AB 1576 were written by policy makers at AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the AHF had yet to open a clinic in Compton which has one of the highest HIV infection rates in [[Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name=2014AVN1576Petition/&gt;

===Proposition 60===

In 2016, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation backed [[California Proposition 60 (2016)|Proposition 60]], which would have enacted a condom mandate similar to Measure B statewide. Proposition 60 was defeated at the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Chappell|first=Bill|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/09/501405749/condom-mandate-for-porn-industry-falls-short-in-california|title=Condom Mandate For Porn Industry Falls Short In California|newspaper=NPR.org|date=November 9, 2016|access-date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal appeal==

===2013===
In January 2013, Universal City-based [[Vivid Entertainment]] filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles County health department saying that the measure violated actors' rights to free speech and expression. In August 2013, [[U.S. District Judge]] [[Dean Pregerson]] delivered a mixed ruling to the adult film industry saying that while making actors wear condoms during porn shoots does not violate the [[First Amendment]], enforcing such a law raises constitutional questions, and denied the adult film industry's motion for a preliminary injunction.&lt;ref name=Lawsuit1&gt;{{cite news|last=Abram|first=Susan|title=LA's condoms in porn law gets a mixed legal ruling|url=http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20130817/las-condoms-in-porn-law-gets-a-mixed-legal-ruling|accessdate=February 11, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|date=August 17, 2013 &lt;!--11:11 AM PDT--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Pregerson agreed that some of the provisions and language of measure were too vague and did not sufficiently explain condom use when other sex acts were being filmed. He also questioned the manner of inspections to be conducted and agreed with the industry that their rights could be violated. Pregerson wrote, "Given that adult filming could occur almost anywhere, Measure B would seem to authorize a health officer to enter and search any part of a private home in the middle of the night, because he suspects violations are occurring. This is unconstitutional because it is akin to a general warrant...".&lt;ref name=Lawsuit1/&gt;

Both sides considered the judgment a victory. Vivid Entertainment founder and co-chairman [[Steven Hirsch]] said in a statement that he is pleased with the decision regarding the enforcement questions, but plans to appeal the part of the ruling that upholds the measure. He stated, "We won most everything we sought to be determined unconstitutional with Measure B. We are, however, disappointed the Court found it necessary to rewrite a portion of the measure in order to salvage a small portion of the measure and refused, at this time, to accept the adult industry's own regulations by imposing an unfunded mandate upon the county by AHF." AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein stated, "Today's ruling that requiring condoms in porn is constitutional is just a tremendous, tremendous victory, one that will go a long way to safeguard the health and safety of those adult performers working in the industry." Vivid filed an appeal.&lt;ref name=1YR/&gt;

===2014===
In March 2014, the appeal of Judge Pregerson's ruling was argued before the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], with a three-judge panel asking questions to both the appellants and the appellee, which was the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) rather than the lawsuit's official defendant, Los Angeles County.&lt;ref name=March2014Appeal&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Ninth Circuit Hears Measure B Appeal|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/Ninth-Circuit-Hears-Measure-B-Appeal-551133.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel was headed by Ninth Circuit Chief Justice [[Alex Kozinski]], Circuit judge [[Susan P. Graber]], a Clinton appointee, and Judge [[Jack Zouhary]] of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, a George W. Bush appointee.&lt;ref name=March2014Appeal/&gt;

On December 15, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's order denying a motion to overturn the Measure.&lt;ref&gt;Vivid Entertainment v. Fielding, No. 13-56445 (9th Cir., Dec. 15, 2014), available at http://legalmasters.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/9th-Circuit-Affirm-Denial-of-Injunction-of-LA-Safer-Sex-Initiative-13-56445.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the ruling, it was stated "that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the invalid portions of Measure B (allowing for modification, suspension, and revocation of permits; authorizing administrative searches; and allowing discretion in setting fees) were severable".&lt;ref name=20149thNo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pardon|first1=Rhett|title=Vivid Loses Appeal Over Measure B|url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/188984|website=XBIZ.com|publisher=XBIZ|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of which is that court upheld the portions of the Measure which were not struck down by U.S. District Court Judge Pregerson. The court also took the position that "the condom mandate ... has only a [[de minimis]] (negligible) effect on expression." According to [[AVN (magazine)|AVN]] magazine legal analyst [[Mark Kernes]] this position ignores "the fact that historically, every company that has adopted a mandatory condom policy has experienced a drop in sales, which translates to a decreased ability to have its message seen by the public."&lt;ref name=2014AVNanalysis&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kernes|first1=Mark|title=Ninth Circuit Panel Upholds Measure B—At Least Until Trial Three-judge panel claims it has jurisdiction to review the case despite AHF's lack of standing|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/Ninth-Circuit-Panel-Upholds-Measure-B-At-Least-Until-Trial-582719.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the ruling, [[Diane Duke]], CEO of the [[Free Speech Coalition]], stated,&lt;ref name=2014FSC&gt;{{cite web|title=FSC: 'Measure B Decision will Hurt Performers'|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/FSC-Measure-B-Decision-will-Hurt-Performers-582729.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While this intermediate decision allows that condoms may be mandated, it doesn't mean they should be. We have spent the last two years fighting for the rights of adult performers to make their own decisions about their bodies, and against the stigma against adult film performers embodied in the statute. Rather than protect adult performers, a condom mandate pushes a legal industry underground where workers are less safe. This is terrible policy that has been defeated in other legislative venues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

AHF president Michael Weinstein stated,&lt;ref name=2014AHF&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kenslea|first1=Ged|title=U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Condoms In Porn Mandate|url=http://www.aidshealth.org/#/u-s-appeals-court-upholds-condoms-in-porn-mandate/|website=AIDS Health|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today's ruling is a total vindication of AHF's position. We call on Los Angeles County for full enforcement of this law now. As the lower court said, they need to set fees based on actual cost. The porn industry has considered every option but following the law. Now it's time to do what fifty-seven percent of Los Angeles County voters have asked of the industry—and what the courts have upheld as constitutional.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He further stated that he hoped the adult entertainment industry will continue to appeal, taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, for a final and definitive ruling.&lt;ref name=20149thNo/&gt;

'''Medical education in Iraq''' is based on the 6-year [[United Kingdom|British]] [[curriculum]] and is carried out in [[English language|English]]. Medical education is free, and  all required textbooks are provided free to students. [[Postgraduate education|Postgraduate]] residency training is required for both [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] and [[Arab]] board certification in each specialty. Before the [[Gulf War]], the [[Politics of Iraq|government]] funded subspecialty training abroad.

Academic [[physician]]s in [[Iraq]], most of whom are specialists, are expected to publish their research in [[peer review]]ed journals to be eligible for promotion to the highest levels. After [[United Nations]] sanctions were imposed in 1990, the delivery of [[Europe]]an and [[United Nations|American]] [[medical journal]]s to Iraq abruptly stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are 20 colleges of [[medicine]] in Iraq, seven colleges of [[nursing]], 10 colleges of [[dentistry]] and 8 colleges of [[pharmacy]] in addition to 6 technical colleges and 20 colleges of sciences which take the responsibility for supporting [[health care]] services and delivery.&lt;ref&gt;June 2007 - Volume 5, Issue 4, Middle east Journal of Family Medicine, Quality and Accreditation in Health Professions Education in Iraq - Accreditation in Health Professions Education, Dr. Thamer Kadum Yousif Al Hilfy, http://www.mejfm.com/volume-5_issue-4/towards_quality.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraqi doctors==
US officials report that an estimated 8,000 Iraqi [[Physician|doctor]]s stopped practicing medicine from 2003 to 2008 because doctors became targets for [[murder]] and [[kidnapping]]. US health officials say Iraq probably needs about 100,000 doctors to meet the needs of its population, but has only 15,000 now.&lt;ref&gt;"Iraqi doctors training in US", By KEVIN FREKING, Associated Press Writer Sunday, November 30, 2008, http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/11/30/national/w052924S16.DTL&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, hoping to prevent doctors from [[emigration|emigrating]], the [[Iraqi government]] encouraged private medical practices. Four years later it allowed [[hospital]]s to charge some fees. The government also encouraged organizations including the [[Red Cross]] and the [[Red Crescent]] to build PHCs and help support hospitals.&lt;ref name=corpwatch&gt;health care system in Iraq, High-Tech Healthcare in Iraq, Minus the Healthcare by Pratap Chatterjee, Special to CorpWatch January 8th, 2007, http://warprofiteers.com/article.php?id=14290 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328132837/http://www.warprofiteers.com/article.php?id=14290 |date=2009-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lower Kama Reservoir''' or '''Nizhnekamsk Reservoir''' ({{lang-ru|Нижнекамское водоранилище}}, {{lang-tt|Түбән Кама сусаклагычы}}) is the lowest reservoir from the [[Kama River]] hydroelectric cascade. It is situated in [[Tatarstan]], [[Udmurtia]], [[Bashkortostan]] and [[Perm Krai]], [[Russian Federation]]. The reservoir was filled in 1978-81 up to 62 m above sea level after the construction of dam of the [[Lower Kama Hydroelectric Station]]. The water level in reservoir depends on the upper reservoirs regime ([[Kama Reservoir]] and [[Votkinsk Reservoir]]). The Lower Kama Reservoir has a surface area of 1,084&amp;nbsp;km² and a volume of 2.8&amp;nbsp;billion cubic meters. Its length along Kama is 185&amp;nbsp;km and 157&amp;nbsp;km along [[Belaya River (Kama)|Belaya]]. The reservoir also used for water supply, irrigation and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{TES|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planned level of the reservoir is 68 m above sea level. Tatarstan government announced plans to reach the full planned power of the electric station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.rferl.org/reports/tb-daily-report/ Parliament Gives Up On Reviving Kama Alany Nuclear Power Station Project]&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological movement inside of Tatarstan opposes these plans, as the reservoir will flood [[Kulyagash]] wetland and other lands in that case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.rferl.org/reports/tb-daily-report/2005/10/0-031005.asp Nuclear Project Sparks Criticism]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nutrition Education''' is any combination of educational strategies, accompanied by environmental supports, designed to facilitate voluntary adoption of food choices and other food- and nutrition-related behaviors conducive to health and well-being. Nutrition education is delivered through multiple venues and involves activities at the individual, community, and policy levels.&lt;ref&gt;Nutrition education: Linking research, theory and practice. Jones &amp; Bartlett, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{page number needed|date=July 2017}}

The work of nutrition educators takes place in colleges, universities and schools, government agencies, [[Cooperative extension service|cooperative extension]], communications and public relations firms, the food industry, voluntary and service organizations and with other reliable places of nutrition and health education information. Nutrition education is a mechanism to enhance awareness,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} as a means to self-efficacy, surrounding the trigger of healthy behaviors&lt;ref&gt;Ronda G, Van Assema P, Brug J. Stages of change, psychological factors and awareness of physical activity levels in The Netherlands. Health Promot Int. 2001;16(4):305-314&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of government agencies that incorporate nutrition education into their programs, include:
* [[Let's Move]], launched by First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] in February 2010, through the [http://www.letsmove.gov/healthierschoolfood.php Healthier US School Challenge];
* USDA [[Food and Nutrition Service]], which provides nutrition education materials to children and adults of all ages and nutrition education to [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP) participants and applicants;

The '''Platt Report''', formerly called the '''Welfare of Sick Children in Hospital (Ministry of Health,  1959)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Platt|first1=Sir Harry|last2=Ministry of Health|title=The Welfare of Children in Hospital|url=https://archive.org/details/op1266065-1001|website=Internet Archive|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=26 April 2018|archiveurl=https://ia800201.us.archive.org/8/items/op1266065-1001/op1266065-1001.pdf|archive-date=1959 |location=University of Southampton|format=pdf|date=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a report, that was the result of research into the welfare of children who were undergoing medical treatment within the UK, and to make suggestions that could be passed on to the hospital authorities that would improve their welfare during hospital visits. The report was named after Sir [[Harry Platt]]. Platt who was the President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]], produced the report at the behest of the [[Department of Health and Social Care|Ministry of Health]] in the UK government. The recommendations in the Platt Report, provided the means by which a child trauma ward of a hospital should be planned for children.&lt;ref name="LittleFrayn1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rod A.

:''To make a special study of the arrangements made in hospitals for the welfare of ill children – as distinct from the medical and nursing treatment – and to make suggestions which could be passed on to hospital authorities.''

The findings of the report by the committee, was that hospitals were miserable places for children, and while in hospital, they had to follow strict ward routine, and were not allowed to play. Moreover, the most grievous of the findings, was that parents were, under no circumstances, allowed to visit their children outside visiting hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=L |last2=Nixon |first2=J.|title=I want my mummy". Changes in the care of children in hospital|journal=Collegian|date=5 April 1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=16–23|pmid=9644334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Reports==
The Platt Report was one of several reports in the United Kingdom that have been produced which clearly state the  psychosocial and emotional needs of children in hospital and the community.&lt;ref name="TaylorMuller1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jayne Taylor|author2=Dave Muller|author3=Pam Harris|title=Nursing Children: Psychology, Research and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0y3Ikn9EXIC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=8 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-3327-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Court Report]] was produced in 1976, by [[Donald Court]], which proposed the most radical change in the medical care of children this century. Newer reports included the [[Welfare of Children and Young People]] in 1991, [[Children First]] in 1993, [[Child Health in the Community]] that was produced in 1996, [[Specific needs of Children and Young People]] in 1997 along with [[Health Services for Children and Young People:Home and School]] in 1997 and finally the [[Children Act 1989]].&lt;ref name="TaylorMuller1999"/&gt;

==Function==
Membership of the report committee included two surgeons, two physicians, one nurse and one Registered Sick Children [[Nursing|Nurse]]. Over its lifetime from 1956 to 1958, the committee met 20 times to consider both written and oral evidence, taken from a number of organisations including the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]], [[Royal College of Physicians]], [[Royal College of Nursing]], the [[Tavistock Institute]] and the [[National association for Maternal and child welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shuttleworth|first1=Ann|title=00   A health website for children|journal=Nursing Times|date=2003|volume=99|issue=44|pages=18–19|url=https://www.nursingtimes.net/Journals/2012/11/16/d/f/u/031104A-health-website-for-children.pdf|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  ''[[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' confirmed in an article on November 18, 1961, that on the previous 9 November, that in reply to a question, in the [[House of Commons]], the Minister of Health, [[Enoch Powell]], accepted the report:

:''The government, with the agreement of the medical profession, accept the main principles of the report.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Platt Report|journal=British Medical Journal|date=15 July 1961|volume=2|issue=5245|pages=159|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5245.159|pmid=20789190|pmc=1969166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The Platt Report recommended that children should have unfettered access to their parents while ill. The [[Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare]] (NAWCH) had consistently campaigned over many years for the same position, and conducted ongoing monitoring of the effects of the report.  In 1982, the NAWCH conducted a survey throughout England. The survey found that progress was slowly being made and 49% of wards studied allowed unrestricted access for parents. The survey also looked at where children were being nursed and found that despite the recommendations of the Platt Report being broadly accepted by the government in 1959, 28% of children were still being nursed on adult wards. Whilst it may have been anticipated that the parents denied open access to children were those whose children were being nursed on adult wards, the survey show that 48% of children's wards still did not have open access. The children who fared worse were children on [[Otorhinolaryngology|ear, nose and throat]] wards with 24% being denied visits on the day of operation and with many spending up to 36 hours away from their parents.&lt;ref name="jim"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jayne Taylor|author2=Dave Muller|author3=Pam Harris|title=Nursing Children: Psychology, Research and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0y3Ikn9EXIC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=8 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-3327-9|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes occurred rapidly from the 1980s onwards, due to a new generation of doctors and nurses who were sympathetic to the recommendations of the report. A follow up study by NAWCH during 1986 showed great improvement, although a detailed look at changes in the interim year showed a few instance where small children's units had closed and children transferred to adult wards. The second survey was, however, on the whole very encouraging with 85% of parents having open access and another 4% of parents on open access except on operating day.&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;

With the introduction of the ''Leiden charter'' in 1988 from the [[European Association for Children in Hospital]]&lt;ref name="jsa"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of EACH |url=https://www.each-for-sick-children.org/home/history |website=European Association for Children in Hospital |publisher=EACH |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that became a working framework for national paediatric organisations in Europe and the creation of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] formalised the Platt report recommendations at the international level.

By 1993, a report by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]], called ''Children First'' showed further improvements had been made, but highlighted the needs of adolescents, indicating that the Platt report recommendations had not been fully implemented.&lt;ref name="jim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MoulesRamsay1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tina Moules|author2=Joan Ramsay|title=The Textbook of Children's Nursing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLaXcDojIe0C&amp;pg=PA583|accessdate=25 September 2018|year=1998|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-3340-8|page=583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first two decades of [[21st century]], the re-framing of the idea of family centred care to a child-centred care approach was taking place. This approach was directly influenced by the UN convention, which in turn was driven by the Platt Report recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Imelda |last2=Hallström |first2=Inger |last3=Söderbäck |first3=Maja |title=Reframing the focus from a family-centred to a child-centred care approach for children’s healthcare |journal=Journal of Child Health Care |date=25 July 2016 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=494–502 |doi=10.1177/1367493516642744 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the Platt Report directing policy at the national level within the United Kingdom from the 1950s onwards, it would have been unlikely these changes would have taken place. Even now, the Platt report is still considered relevant to the forming of policy that aims to improve childcare and associated services.&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt;

==Hospital visiting of sick children==
===1850–1910===
To understand why the Platt Report was produced, and put into effect, an examination of the hospitalization of children, leading up to the mid 1950s must be made.&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt; From the 1850s to around 1910, most of the cities in the UK had built their own children's hospitals, which included a large number of prestigious hospitals, e.g. [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow]], [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] and the [[Royal Manchester Children's Hospital]]. These were independent institutions funded by voluntary donations, and from research, were shown to be designed for the ''deserving poor'' largely reflecting Victorian values. Children could only be admitted, if they were sponsored by a letter of recommendation, from a hospital affiliate. The ''undeserving poor'' were sent to workhouse infirmaries, whilst middle class children were generally cared for, and indeed operated on, at home.&lt;ref name="Stacey2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Professor Margaret Stacey|title=The Sociology of Health and Healing: A Textbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4jqIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=25 September 2018|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-89793-3|pages=63–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hospitals set their own rules and had their own way of working, including regulating admissions, that often excluded infants and children under the age of two on humanitarian and pragmatic grounds.&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt;

The Scottish paediatrician [[George Armstrong (physician)|George Armstrong]], who established the first British [[dispensary]], in 1769, was against in-patient care, i.e. hospitals for sick children. Armstrong stated:

:''But a very little reflection will clearly convince any thinking person that such a Scheme as this can never be executed. If you take away a sick child for its Parents or Nurse, you break its heart immediately.&lt;ref name="BeukersMoll1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=H. Beukers|author2=John Michael Henderson Moll|title=Clinical Teaching, Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1sZWKMtAD8C&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=21 May 2018|year=1989|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-5183-082-3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to admission were sometimes based on pragmatic reasons, e.g. reducing the threat of cross infection from children with diseases such as [[typhus]], [[diphtheria]] and [[measles]], that were a major cause of infant mortality. The voluntary nature of hospitals meant that such outbreaks were very costly. Babies and small children required more nursing care. However, by the 1880s more and more hospitals were accepting children. By the 1870s, the prevalent view among doctors and nurses that that children were better off by being removed to hospital, away from the often poor, unsanitary conditions at home.&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt;

There were enlightened people like surgeon [[James Henderson Nicholl]] of the Glasgow Hospital for Sick Children, who pioneered day surgery procedures such as [[Hernia]] and [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]] and who stated in 1909 that:

:''in children under 2 years of age, there a few operations indeed that cannot be as advantageously carried out in the out patient departments as in the wards.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicoll|first1=James  H.|title=The Surgery of Infancy|journal=British Medical Journal|date=18 September 1909|pages=753–754|url=http://drcesarramirez.com/files/te_interesa/Nicoll_THE_SURGERY_OF_INFANCY.pdf|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholl's believed that hospitalization wasn't necessary, and children were better cared from in their own home, both by their parents and by nurses who made daily visits to the children. Nicholl's recognised that ''separation from mother is often harmful''. However, Nicholl's views were in the exception. For almost 50 years, whether children were in a workhouse infirmary, sanatorium or a hospital, they separated from the mothers and families and only visited, on a very strict visit schedule. By the end of the [[20th century]], children's hospitals had become

:''depersonalised scientific institutions dominations by both male and female professionals''.&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt;

===1910-1950===
With the rising of [[behaviourism]] from the 1900s to the 1950s, children were rarely see as individuals, and they became more of a collective problem to be solved. Behaviourism had many advocates, and amongst the strongest proponents of the philosophy were [[John B. Watson]] and [[Truby King]]. Watson stated the following advice regarding children:

King, who promulgated a specific kind of child rearing, advocated that the child had to be breastfed, based on a strict schedule every 4 fours, not to cuddle them, and not to feed babies or children at night, lest they cried and became spoiled. King had became well known, as a child rearing expert during the interwar period, and his advice was widely accepted by the medical community.&lt;ref name="Hendrick2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Hendrick|title=Narcissistic Parenting in an Insecure World: A History of Parenting Culture 1920s to Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09mfDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=25 September 2018|date=6 July 2016|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=978-1-4473-2256-6|pages=42–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, hospitals were grim places for children, and only addressed the physical needs of the child, never noticing the emotional and [[Psychology|psychological]] needs.

However, there were dissenting voices, both for those who had started to question the tenets of behaviourism, and those who already recognized the unique link between the child and their mother, who would nurse them in times of ill health and who always felt responsible for the child's recovery. [[James Calvert Spence|Sir James Calvert Spence]] began the practice, then unique in Britain, of admitting mothers to hospital with their sick children,&lt;ref name="hospital"&gt;{{vcite journal | author=Spence JC | title=The care of children in hospitals | journal=British Medical Journal | date=1947 | volume=1 | issue=4490 | pages=125–30 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2052901/pdf/brmedj03765-0003.pdf | doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.4490.125 | pmid= 20244686| pmc=2052901}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they might nurse them and feel responsible for the child's recovery. However, as a visionary, Spence was unique in this position, during that period in the 1920s, when he established his resident mother and baby unit in 1926.&lt;ref name="hospital"/&gt; By the 1930s there was physicians who recognised the need, including [[Agnes Hunt]], who introduced open visiting.

During the interwar period, leading up to the [[World War II]], research conduced by people like [[Harry Edelston]] and [[John Bowlby]] further eroded the importance and veracity of behaviourism. Edelston, a [[Psychiatrist]] in Leeds, detailed that children were emotionally damaged by their stay in hospital.&lt;ref name="Karen1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Karen|title=Becoming Attached: First Relationships and how They Shape Our Capacity to Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrxIW0ITbgkC&amp;pg=PA68|accessdate=1 May 2018|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-511501-7|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, [[John Bowlby]] wrote an open letter to the [[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]] which criticized government plans to [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuate]] a million children from towns and cities to the safety of  the countryside. Controversially, Bowlby and his co-signatories pointed out in a letter that the psychological danger of removing children under the age of five years, from their mothers far outweighed the dangers of leaving them in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winnicott |first1=Donald W. |editor1-last=Caldwell |editor1-first=Lesley |editor2-last=Robinson |editor2-first=Helen Taylor |title=The collected works of D.W.

Despite [[L.A. Perry]]'s 1947 [[The Lancet|Lancet]] article, that vigorously protested the restrictions of parental visits on hospitalized children, Edelston wrote in 1948, that many of this colleagues still refused to believe in ''hospitalisation trauma''&lt;ref name="Karen1994"/&gt; Bowlby would later study 44 juvenile thieves and found that a significantly high number had experienced early and traumatic separation from their mother. Bowlby would use the data in 1949 on the delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospitalised and institutionalised care in the commission to write a report for the [[World Health Organization]]'s on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe.&lt;ref name="Karen1994"/&gt;

In the late 1930s, work by [[René Spitz]], an Austrian-American [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], confirmed the findings by Edelston, Bowlby and Perry, specifically deleterious effects of hospitalization, based on his research with institutionalized children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spitz |first1=Rene A. |title=Hospitalism An Inquiry into the Genesis of Psychiatric Conditions in Early Childhood |journal=The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child |date=13 February 2017 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=53–74 |doi=10.1080/00797308.1945.11823126 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical research from both America and the United Kingdom now evidenced the premise that maternal deprivation was damaging to the child and this simple fact further challenged the tenets of Behaviourism.  During interwar period, there was a growing realization, that the adhoc system of municipal hospitals, many that were former work house infirmaries and voluntary hospitals that provided 25% of care services, no longer provided the level of services that were needed and were no longer considered a ''good fit'' with the needs of the medical community. Indeed, by the 1930s many voluntary hospitals had already become fee-charging institutions.&lt;ref name="WalshStephens2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Walsh|author2=Paul Stephens|author3=Stephen Moore|title=Social Policy and Welfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9HeJFoUhxYC&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=25 September 2018|year=2000|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-4591-3|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Emergency Hospital Service|Emergency Medical Service]] that was established to care for civilian casualties during war, acted as a blueprint for what a future integrated medical care service, in the UK, could look like. With the publication of the [[Beveridge Report]] in November 1942, that posited the foundation of a [[Welfare state]] as well as an integrated medical care service in the form of a [[National Health Service]], that was subsequently established in 1948, it enabled national policy directives to be applied to the whole service. The Platt Report was one of those directives, designed in a manner, to improve the delivery of care.

===1950-1959===
With the introduction of [[Penicillin]] into the majority of the medical community by the 1940s, the major objection by doctors and nurses, that visits by parents into hospital wards introduced cross infections had been removed. A major review in 1949, over an 11-month periods showed that children admitted to 26 wards in 14 hospitals showed no correlation between visits and cross infection from parents to children. Indeed, by that time, the working practices of doctors and nurses, still posed the main objection to visiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watkins |first1=A.

:''The hospitalised child was considered essentially a biological unit, far better off without his parents who, on weekly or bi-weekly visiting hours, were fundamentally toxic in their effect, causing noise, generally disorderly conduct, and rejection by hospital personnel''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=A.D.|title=On the Hospitalisation of Children: An Historical Approach|journal=Pediatrics|date=November 1974|volume=54|issue=5|pages=542–546|pmid=4616215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the prevailing view was starting to change. [[John Bowlby]], the British British [[psychologist]], [[psychiatrist]], and [[psychoanalyst]] along with his research assistant at the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust|Tavistock Clinic]], [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]], the Scottish social worker, and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], started researching the separation of young children by their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jools|first1=Page|title=The Routledge International Handbook of Philosophies and Theories of Early Childhood Education and Care|date=October  2015|publisher=Routledge|location=University of Brighton Repository|isbn=9781138022812|pages=80–90|url=http://eprints.brighton.ac.uk/18244/1/Chapter%209%20Jools%20Page%20-%20Bowlby%20%26%20Attachment%20theory%20%28%20Authors%20final%29.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2018|format=pdf|chapter=Chapter 9 - The Legacy of John Bowlby’s Attachment Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby was the scientist who developed classic theories about maternal separation. Robertson focused his research on separation of mother and child due to hospital admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alsop‐Shields|first1=Linda|last2=Mohay|first2=Heather|title=John Bowlby and James Robertson: theorists, scientists and crusaders for improvements in the care of children in hospital|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|date=20 December 2001|volume=35|issue=1|pages=50–58|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2001.01821.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Robertson first started to make observations of young children in hospital wards, he was shocked by the unhappiness he saw among the youngest children, in particular those aged under 3. The competent, efficient doctors and nurses gave good medical care but seemed unaware of the suffering around them. They saw that children initially protested at separation from the parents, but then settled, becoming quiet and compliant. However, Robertson saw this as a danger signal.

Based on several years of observations in long and short stay wards, Bowlby and Robertson formed a theory of phases of response of the under 3's to a stay in hospital without the mother: Protest, Despair and Denial/Detachment. In the protest phase, the child is visibly distressed, cries and calls for their mother. In the despair phase, the child gives up hope of his mother returning and becomes withdrawn and quiet, and may appear to be 'settling'. In the denial/detachment phase, the child shows more interest in his surroundings and interacts with others - but seems hardly to know the mother when she visits or care when she leaves. Finally, the child seems not to need any mothering at all. His relationships with others are shallow and untrusting.&lt;ref name="Horst2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank C. P. van der Horst|title=John Bowlby - From Psychoanalysis to Ethology: Unravelling the Roots of Attachment Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Nb_9lVkH8MC&amp;pg=PA1904|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=21 March 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-99626-2|page=1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby's and Robertson's research was met with hostility by the medical profession. Even their colleagues at the Tavistock Clinic, although accepting, did not feel the same sense of urgency.

In 1951, Bowlby and Robertson attempted to get their views across, by presenting to the [[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health|British Paediatric Association]] but these views were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Horst|first1=Frank C.P|last2=Van der Veer|first2=René|title=Changing attitudes towards the care of children in hospital: a new assessment of the influence of the work of Bowlby and Robertson in the UK, 1940-1970|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|date=5 Mar 2009|volume=11|issue=2|pages=119–142 |doi=10.1080/14616730802503655 |pmid=19266362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Robertson decided to take a different tack, by making a short, silent, black and white, documentary film in November 1952, called [[A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowlby |first1=John |last2=Robertson |first2=James|title=A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=June 1953|volume=46 |issue=16|pages=425–427|pmid=13074181|pmc=1918555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Two Year Old goes to Hospital (Robertson Films)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s14Q-_Bxc_U|website=Youtube|publisher=Google|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a hand-held camera, Robertson working with his wife [[Joyce Robertson]], a researcher, selected a little girl, called Laura, aged 2 years and 5 months, who was admitted to hospital, for the removal of tonsils, a common operation in those days. Laura was initially composed, until she realised her mother had actually left her there, and the film shows how she developed acute and continuous distress... Laura pleaded to be taken home, but as her protests and pleadings were useless, they were gradually followed by despair. She became listless, unsmiling and her traumatised emotional state was heart-rendingly clear, and on those occasions when her mother did visit during the eight days she was in hospital, Laura would turn away from her.&lt;ref name="Cook2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Cook|title=Mothering Denied: The Sources of Love, and How Our Culture Harms Infants, Women, and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq_lRov-oxMC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=21 May 2018|year=2008|publisher=Peter Cook|isbn=978-0-646-50366-0|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson's film was show to the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] on 28 November 1952, before a large audience of doctors and nurses.&lt;ref name="Horst"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank C. P. van der Horst|title=John Bowlby - From Psychoanalysis to Ethology: Unravelling the Roots of Attachment Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Nb_9lVkH8MC&amp;pg=PA1957|accessdate=31 May 2018|date=21 March 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-99626-2|page=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Winnicott]] on seeing the film spoke of ''highly successful film'' that dealt with a ''real problem'' and evidenced the fact that he himself had seen irreversible change as a result of the separation of small children from their mothers. Both the editors of [[The Lancet]] and [[The BMJ]] discussed the meeting. The BMJ agreed that the 2-year-old girl was unhappy, and that this was in line with the findings of [[John Bowlby]]. The Lancet stated that the audience frankly refused to admit that the child was distressed and were reluctant to believe that it might cause long term damage.&lt;ref name="Horst"/&gt;  Robertson's memory of the meeting, was that ''it was if we had dropped a bomb in the hall'' and that ''the film encountered much resistance and rejection''. The speakers also supposedly also said that Robertson ''had slandered paediatrics and the film should be withdrawn''.&lt;ref name="Horst"/&gt; Two people who were at the meeting were [[Donald Winnicott]] and Sister [[Ivy Morris]] from [[Amersham Hospital]] and they agreed to a second filming on their ward. Robertson later took film and viewed it to American paediatricians in 1953, but curiously American audiences confirmed that the film findings were applicable to British children, but they did not apply to American children, and were perhaps less cared for and protected in an overindulgent way, and were therefore less upset at being separated from their parent. However, Robertson's subsequent research in the United States merely confirmed his findings, and showed that on both sides of the Atlantic, there were those who were in favour of unrestricted visiting, and those who were not. Robertson eventually viewed the film to paediatricians and other healthcare professionals in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. Robertson noticed that younger professionals were more accepting of the evidence, while senior professionals tended to reject the film.&lt;ref name="Horst"/&gt;
Robertson's successor film was called, [[Going to Hospital with Mother]].&lt;ref name="nch1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=James|title=Going to Hospital with Mother|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=10 December 1958|volume=52|issue=381 |page=15 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/003591575905200518|accessdate=21 May 2018|format=pdf|doi=10.1177/003591575905200518|doi-broken-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson chose Amersham Hospital specifically, as every mother of a child under 5 years was invited to come into residence in the hospital, without discriminating between good mothers and over-anxious mothers.&lt;ref name="nch1"/&gt; Bowlby and Robertson created a film, which was more about the study of human relationship, and showed how children responded differently to treatment when mother was present and how the staff of one hospital had created a way of admitting the mother with the child without making structural changes to the ward.&lt;ref name="nch1"/&gt; The second film was based on Sally, who is 20 months old, and is lively and funny. When attending hospital for a minor operation, she arrives with her mother. When the surgeon calls, Sally protests, but with her mother there, her protest is brief. The film follows Sally throughout the hospital visit with her mother present throughout. When Sally returns home, she has none of the attendant disturbed behaviour of those who have been in hospital without their mother.&lt;ref name="nch1"/&gt; Even though the film was shown widely, the pace of progress was still glacial. Indeed, [[The Lancet]] reported in 1956, that only 10% of hospital now restricted visiting, even though the Minister of Health [[Robin Turton]] was repeatedly asking for changes.&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt;

====Platt report====
The glacial process resulted in pressure being bought to bear by both James and Joyce Robertson with other doctors and parents against the medical establishment,&lt;ref name="Smith2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

:''To make a special study of the arrangements made in hospital for the welfare of children - as distinct from their medical and nursing treatment - and to make suggestions which could be passed on to the hospital authorities''.&lt;ref name="RichardsonGlasper2010"/&gt;

The report was commissioned on 12 June 1956.&lt;ref name="RichardsonGlasper2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Jim Richardson|author2=Edward Alan Glasper|title=A Textbook of Children's and Young People's Nursing E-Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca_SetY3yE8C&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=16 June 2018|date=19 May 2010|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-7020-4440-7|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Harry Platt]], who was a former president of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] was chosen to be [[Chairman]] of the committee. The committee met 20 times to take evidence from both sides of the debate in a manner that was scrupulously fair. Both parents and health professionals as well as children's organisations including charities gave evidence. The [[Association of British Paediatric Nurses]] provided evidence to the contrary, arguing for the status quo, that frequent visitors bought infection into the ward. Both James Robertson and John Bowlby also provided evidence. James Robertson appeared in front of the committee with [[Dermod MacCarthy]] to show his film ''A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital'', but upon requesting the [[BBC]] to show the film nationally, were refused, as the BBC had consulted medical opinion, which agreed that the film would cause anxiety to parents. However, the evidence provided by James and Joyce Robertson was extremely influential to the final recommendations of the report.&lt;ref name="ButterworthFaugier2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tony Butterworth|author2=Jean Faugier|title=Clinical Supervision and Mentorship in Nursing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1H2BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=16 June 2018|date=14 December 2013|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4899-7228-6 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report was sent to Lord Cohen of Birkenhead, Chair of the Central Health Services Council on 28 October 1958.&lt;ref name="RichardsonGlasper2010"/&gt;

The Platt Report was made up of four sections, dealing with preparation for admission, admission procedure, in-patient care and patient discharge, respectively.&lt;ref name="BillsonHumphreys2000"/&gt; The Report had profound and lasting effects on the welfare of children, not only with the United Kingdom, but in other countries like [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="RichardsonGlasper2010"/&gt; The main recommendations of the report were:

* Hospitals should have a separate children's outpatients department or a separate waiting room in an adult department or casualty department. Children and adolescents should not be nursed on an adult ward. There should be facilities for inside and outside play. Each nursing team should include a sick children's nurse and the child should have access to other staff such as social worker, occupational therapist and nursery nurses.&lt;ref name="BillsonHumphreys2000"/&gt;
* Prior to admission there should be hospital open days allowing families to have preparatory talks with hospital staff. Hospital leaflets and letters should be available. GP's and health visitors should give explanations and reassurances to children and families.&lt;ref name="BillsonHumphreys2000"/&gt;
* Whilst in hospital, children should be allowed to keep their personal possessions and wear their own clothes. Children should have access to education. Admission of mothers should be considered in the first few days for children under 5 years of age. There should be unrestricted visiting from parents, at reasonable hours of the day and there should be facilities for visitors such as playrooms for siblings and a canteen. Parents should be kept informed of their child's progress by both nursing and medical staff.&lt;ref name="BillsonHumphreys2000"/&gt;
* Unpleasant medical techniques should be kept to the minimum. There should be separate treatment and recovery rooms so other children do not witness distressing procedures. Parents should be present at recovery of anaesthesia. Discussions between medical staff should be kept to the minimum in front of children.&lt;ref name="BillsonHumphreys2000"/&gt;
* Children with special needs may need more in the way of pre-admission preparation. There should have access to any special equipment that is necessary. They should be taught by children who have specialist skills or can access such expertise.&lt;ref name="BillsonHumphreys2000"/&gt;
* On discharge from hospital, parents should be warned about behavioural problems that may arise at home, and how to get advice on how to deal with them.  General practitioners should be informed in advance and sent as full a report as possible.&lt;ref name="BillsonHumphreys2000"/&gt;
* Doctors, nurses and other staff who care for children should be given training about the emotional needs of children in hospital, and how to adjust their procedures to suit children.&lt;ref name="BillsonHumphreys2000"/&gt;

===1959-1980 Post Platt===
During the twenty years after the Platt Report, parents wanting to visit their sick child who were formerly excluded, moved to parents being tolerated by the medical community when they wanted to visit their sick child and this was a break from what could be considered tradition and a move towards a more humanitarian viewpoint. James Robertson continued to research the problem and to share his findings. He wrote four influential articles for [[The Observer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sydney |first1=Brandon |last2=Mary |first2=Lindsay |last3=Jean |first3=Lovell-Davis |last4=Sebastian |first4=Kraemer |title=What is wrong with emotional upset?" – 50 years on from the Platt Report |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=2009 |volume=94 |issue=3 |doi=10.1136/adc.2008.152512 |url=https://adc.bmj.com/content/94/3/173 |accessdate=5 July 2018 |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd |format=pdf |issn=0003-9888}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Guardian]] newspapers to disseminate his ideas,&lt;ref name="DaviesDavies2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ruth Davies|author2=Alyson Davies|title=Children and Young People's Nursing: Principles for Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iW3NBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=5 July 2018|date=29 April 2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4441-4964-7|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the issue started to gain traction. In 1961, the [[BBC]] agreed to show excerpts of ''A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital'' and his other films &lt;ref name="Mold2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Mold|title=Making the Patient-Consumer: Patient Organisations and Health Consumerism in Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbwSDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=5 July 2018|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-9531-3|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robertson gave an live introduction to the films and asked parents to submit their experiences of hospital care to him.&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt; The stories Robertson received from the parents were published in 1962 in a book called ''Hospitals and Children:A Parent's-Eye View''.&lt;ref name="Robertson1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Robertson|title=Hospitals and Children: a Parent's Eye View: A Review of Letters from Parents to the Observer and the BBC.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxYVAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=5 July 2018|year=1963|publisher=International Universities Press, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Platt himself wrote the foreword to book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Robertson|title=Hospitals and Children: a Parent's Eye View: A Review of Letters from Parents to the Observer and the BBC.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxYVAAAAIAAJ|year=1963|publisher=International Universities Press, Incorporated|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Thomas, a young mother living in [[Battersea]], contacted Robertson, to ask what she would do if her own child was hospitalised, and Robertson suggested forming an organisation, which Thomas and a group of women did. The organisation was called the [[Mother Care for Children in Hospital]] and was founded in 1961.&lt;ref name="Mold2015"/&gt; Thomas sent a letter to The Guardian detailing her experiences, and the responses allowed the organisation to grow and campaign for the full implementation of the report. Soon regional groups appeared all over the UK and these amalgamated in 1963, and became the [[National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital]] (NAWCH) in 1965.&lt;ref name="Glasper2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Jim Richardson|author2=Edward Alan Glasper|title=A Textbook of Children's and Young People's Nursing E-Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca_SetY3yE8C&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=5 July 2018|date=19 May 2010|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-7020-4440-7|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Platt Report was accepted by the Ministry of Health and government, they were under no legal obligation to implement the report. In this manner, the NAWCH became a pressure and advocate group, applying pressure both on the government and the nursing profession, which throughout the 1960s and 1970s continued to resist the new recommendations, and advocating for sick children and their families.&lt;ref name="Glasper2010"/&gt;  The NAWCH developed a series of techniques to get hospitals to relax their strict rules. One of these techniques was carrying out surveys of all hospitals, which found that although the hospital said they allowed unrestricted visiting, the reality would be different. One hospital reported they allowed unrestricted visiting, ''but not in the mornings''. Another stated, that ''It was the aim of the board of Governors to have unrestricted visiting, as long as the parents understand that they can't be in the wards all the time.'' [[Otorhinolaryngology]] wards were particularly bad, often getting parents to sign a consent form, that made them agree not to visit the child on the day of operation.&lt;ref name="Mold2015"/&gt; Another technique was to recruit sympathetic doctors and nurses who could advocate for change.&lt;ref name="Mold2015"/&gt; The NAWCH drew attention to these practices by issuing press releases detailing their findings and providing leaflets to parents when visiting hospitals that allowed unrestricted visits, telling them of this fact.&lt;ref name="Mold2015"/&gt; By 1969, a NAWCH survey of 67 hospitals showed that only 57% allowed unrestricted visiting. The same picture emerged regarding the results of survey of 636 hospitals in the United States, reporting only 62% allowed unrestricted visiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fagin |first1=Claire M |last2=Nusbaum, |first2=Jill Glatter |title=Parental Visiting Privileges in Pediatric Units: A Survey |journal=The Journal of Nursing Administration |date=March 1978 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a desire to seek a more benevolent approach to the care of children in hospital, changes occurred that led to a broader trend within the development work. In [[Toronto]], the [[Hospital for Sick Children]] was at the forefront of this approach, when it introduced a blueprint to enable parents to care for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=E.M. |title=Parents Participate in Care of Hospitalized Child |journal=The Canadian Nurse |date=December 1969 |volume=65 |issue=12 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The kind of approach  developed in Toronto was called ''Rooming-in'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barbara |first1=Coome |title=Rooming-in brings family together |journal=The Canadian Nurse |date=June 1969 |volume=65 |issue=6 |page=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and described a hospital unit at  [[St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto)|St. Michael's Hospital]] in Toronto, where both the mother and father look after their new born baby in a room where both mother and baby are cared for together. The ''[[Rooming-in]]'' concept as a philosophy of family centred care was later adopted in Canada. A good example of this was developed at [[McMaster University]] in 1969, in building a new Health Science Centre. Nursing staff arranged visits to specialised facilities for the architects of the centre, enabling the nursing unit and nursery design to be changed to incorporate the ''Rooming-in'' concept to be adopted at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wylie |first1=Norma A. |title=Hospital design is a nursing affair |journal=The Canadian Nurse |date=October 1959 |volume=65 |issue=10 |page=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, the ''Care-by-parents'' model was being developed with the first unit developed and established in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. In these ''[[Care-by-parents]]'' units, parents would live with their sick child. This model was developed to both safe money and quality of care, under the supervision of a nurse. The ''Care-by-parents'' room was designed with en-suite facilities. Coffee and tea making machines were provided with [[Washing machine|laundry]] facilities.&lt;ref name="Shields2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Shields|title=Perioperative Care of the Child: A Nursing Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7NBgodB6oQC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=29 July 2018|date=23 October 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-1463-2|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these units, parents were taught to care for their child and were particularly beneficial for babies who were being breast fed.&lt;ref name="BirchenallAdams2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Birchenall|author2=Nicola Adams|title=The Nursing Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYYdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=29 July 2018|date=7 January 2011|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-0-230-36693-0|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that model, the role and expectations of the parents were outlined on admission.&lt;ref name="BirchenallAdams2011"/&gt; In findings by Clearly et all in a structured observational study, found that children in these units  spent less time alone, slept less and cried less.

The study noted that where a care by parent option could be introduced into a paediatric unit, it had a distinct social and psychological advantages for the children in hospital as well as longer term benefits.&lt;ref name="cleary"/&gt; In a 1968 study by Brain and Maclay's in the [[University Hospital of Wales]] in the [[United Kingdom]], 197 children who underwent [[tonsillectomy]] and [[adenoidectomy]] were split into three control groups. The study found that children without a resident parent did sleep more than the others, children who in the scheme cried less in total than the others outside it, and that nursing staff spent less time with the care by parent group that with the others despite the demands of teaching and support. It also found that children who were accompanied by their mother had significantly lower rates of post-operative complications, including infection and emotional distress, than those who were unaccompanied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brain |first1=D.

Research also showed, that 4% of mothers were difficult to handle by the nursing staff&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt;

The seminal report by [[Pamela Hawthorn]], published in 1974 and called ''[[Nurse, I want my mummy!]]''&lt;ref name="mum"&gt;{{cite report| last1 = Hawthorn | first1= Pamela J. | date= 1974 |title= Nurse-I want my Mummy!, Series 1, Number 3| url= https://www.rcn.org.uk/-/media/royal-college-of-nursing/documents/library/rcn-research-series/nurse-i-want-my-mummy.pdf| publisher   = The Study of Nursing Care Research Project, Royal College of Nursing and National Council of Nurses in the United Kingdom| format= pdf| pages= 120–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; changed the face of patient care in the UK.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jane |first1=Elliot |title=Nurse!

:''Pamela's study was done against the background of a lively debate in paediatrics and psychology as to the degree women should spend with children in the outside world and the degree to which they should be allowed to visit children in hospital... Of course we know now that they had almost given up hope that mum was ever coming back....But children were alone and depressed so Hawthorn said parents should be allowed to visit.''&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

Hawthorn investigated nursing care in 11 hospitals, used qualified nurses who asked questions from standardised questionnaires to gather the research, and found that unrestricted nursing times ranged from the full days access to just a few hours a day. In wards that recognised and implemented Platt's recommendations, it was found that children were less likely to be lonely or miserable.&lt;ref name="mum"/&gt; The most important finding from the study and what prevented the widespread uptake of Platt's recommendations was the lack of Registered Sick Children's Nurses (RSCN) on the wards.&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt; Hawthorn's report found that only 575 RSCN nurses were being trained annually in the 1960s and 1970s, which was insufficient to ensure that every children's emotional and psychological needs were being addressed properly while in ward.&lt;ref name="mum"/&gt;

===1980-2009 Shift to parental participation===

By the 1980s it was obvious to observers that the situation was changing in respect of the ability of parents to visit their sick children in hospital and care for them. Pressure groups like the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital worked tirelessly to push back the boundaries of care, and influenced the development of advocacy in the wider social contract.&lt;ref name="Williamson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlotte Williamson|title=Towards the Emancipation of Patients: Patients' Experiences and the Patient Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4EatyXu7osC&amp;pg=PA102 |accessdate=30 August 2018|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=978-1-84742-744-1|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, an NAWCH survey was conducted that looked at access on children's wards throughout England by [[Rosemary Thornes]].&lt;ref name="tito"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jayne Taylor|author2=Dave Muller|author3=Pam Harris|author4=Lesley A. Wattley|title=Nursing Children: Psychology, Research and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0y3Ikn9EXIC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=22 August 2018|year=1999|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-3327-9|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that 49% of wards studied allowed unrestricted access for parents. The report looked at where children were being nursed and found that despite what the Platt Report recommended, 28% of children were still being nursed on adult wards, and that 48% of children's wards still did not have open access. The children who fared worse were those on the [[otorhinolaryngology]] wards, with 24% being denied visits on the day of the visit, with many children spending up to 36 hours  away from their parents.&lt;ref name="tito"/&gt; It was clear that attitudes were changing as a new generation of doctors and nursings arrived, that naturally accepted the findings of the Platt report, but were stymied by outdated processes, infrastructure and traditional attitudes.

In 1984, the National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital decided to issue a charter to reflect their values and in order to raise the quality of services for children. Jenny Davison of the NAWCH wrote that it was ''formulated by procedures which have become a model for later standard setting''.&lt;ref name="Veerman1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Veerman|first=Philip E. |title=The Rights of the Child and the Changing Image of Childhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zvayKFKkgoC&amp;pg=PA654|date=26 May 1992|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers  |isbn=0-7923-1250-3 |page=654}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter was constructed of 10 principles, with e.g. principle 2 stating that ''Children in hospital shall have the right to have their parents with them at all times. (with caveats)''. Principle 3 stated that it was the child had the ''right to information appropriate to age and understanding''.&lt;ref name="Veerman1992"/&gt; The charter was approved by the [[Royal College of Nursing]] (RCN) and the [[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health|British Paediatric Association]] (RCPCH). The Sainsbury report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sainsbury |first1=C P |last2=Gray |first2=O P |last3=Cleary |first3=J |last4=Davies |first4=M M |last5=Rowlandson |first5=P H |title=Care by parents of their children in hospital. |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=1 June 1986 |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=612–615 |doi=10.1136/adc.61.6.612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the NAWCH in 1986 showed huge improvements in the proportion of wards with entirely unrestricted access for parents with 85% of wards allowing open access to parents,&lt;ref name="rob"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Devlin |first1=R |title=Robertson's Revolution |journal=Nursing times |date=1989 |volume=85 |issue=5 |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but estimated that only 67% of parents were welcomed, and 24% only accepted and 9% only tolerated.&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt; The study report also stated that where small children's units had been closed, the children had been transferred into adult wards.&lt;ref name="rob"/&gt; The 1988 study by Rosemary Thornes, for the NAWCH, supported by the RCN and the RCPCH recommended that all parents under the age of five years should be offered overnight accommodation.

During the 1980s, the medical community continued to research the problem domain, identifying the benefits of parents caring for their children both with the UK and internationally. The Keane report, 1986, found that that a number of resident parents in hospital perceived their children as temperamentally vulnerable, and needed special reassurance and explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keane |first1=S. |last2=Garralda |first2=M.E. |last3=Keen |first3=J.H. |title=Resident parents during paediatric admissions |journal=International Journal of Nursing Studies |date=January 1986 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=247–253 |doi=10.1016/0020-7489(86)90022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sainsbury report, 1986, found that nurses believed that their work role was enhanced, and that most parents coped with caring duties, and were grateful for being considered important  in the process of healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sainsbury |first1=C P |last2=Gray |first2=O P |last3=Cleary |first3=J |last4=Davies |first4=M M |last5=Rowlandson |first5=P H |title=Care by parents of their children in hospital. |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=1 June 1986 |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=612–615 |doi=10.1136/adc.61.6.612}}&lt;/ref&gt; International research focused on different aspects of parent-child care. A Canadian report of 1983, by Evans and Robinson focused on the economic aspects of [[care-by-parent units]] by a parent's stay on the ward can reduce costs by resuming nursing tasks, limiting unnecessary procedures, and encouraging early discharge &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=RG |last2=Robinson |first2=GC |title=An economic study of cost savings on a care-by-parent ward. |journal=Medical care |date=August 1983 |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=768–82 |pmid=6888029}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American report by Stull and Deatrick in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stull |first1=Maryk. |last2=Deatrick |first2=Janet A. |title=Measuring Parental Participatiun: Part I |journal=Issues in Comprehensive Pediatric Nursing |date=10 July 2009 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=157–165 |doi=10.3109/01460868609029852}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to find a methodology for measuring the effectiveness of parental participation in the care of the hospitalized child. The process used was for 24 parents to be tested with 11 parental involvement activities and the research submitted to 19 experts for analysis.  The 11 categories were then to subject to metrics to identify their effectiveness of focus on the activity. An Irish report in 1989, by Taylor and Connor also looked at the reduction in costs associated with parents caring for their child in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=M R |last2=O'Connor |first2=P |title=Resident parents and shorter hospital stay. |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=1 February 1989 |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=274–276 |doi=10.1136/adc.64.2.274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that hospital visits were 31% shorter than those whose parents were not resident, representing a shorter stay in hospital, and a saving as well as meeting the needs of the child, including less emotionally disturbing time spent in hospital visits.

Although research was being conducted in the 1980s to explore the different benefits of parents caring for their children both within hospital, within the community and at home, and were wholly accepting of the Platt report, the British government had a restored focus on the needs of both young and adolescent children, due to a number of [[sentinel event]]s,&lt;ref name="jch"/&gt; that occurred during the late 1980s and early 1990s with the Platt Report being referred to during proceedings. This resulted in the UK government allocating additional funding to train more Registered Sick Children's Nurse's (RSCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davies |first1=Ruth |title=Children’s nursing and future directions: Learning from ‘memorable events’ |journal=Nurse Education Today |date=October 2008 |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=814–821 |doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2008.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This one action sped up efforts to achieve the full implementation of the Platt Report in the UK.

In the international stage, events were occurring that was progressing both the implementation and acceptance of the Platt report recommendations.  The [[European Association for Children in Hospital]] (EACH), was an umbrella association representing a number of member associations involved in the welfare of all children in Europe. In 1988, twelve of the member associations of EACH, met in [[Leiden]] and created a charter, based on the recommendations of the Platt report and the charter created in 1984 by the Action for Sick Children charity, the new name of the NAWCH. The NAWCH changed names in 1990.&lt;ref name="BrookerWaugh2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Brooker|author2=Anne Waugh|title=Foundations of Nursing Practice E-Book: Fundamentals of Holistic Care|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vajQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84|accessdate=19 September 2018|date=15 February 2007|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-7234-3534-0|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; The ''Leiden Charter'', as it was colloquially named,  became a working framework for the national associations that were part of the EACH. The Leiden charter consisted of 10 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Text of the Charter |url=https://www.each-for-sick-children.org/each-charter/the-10-articles-of-the-each-charter |website=European Association for Children in Hospital |publisher=EACH |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually ratified by 16 European countries and [[Japan]].

Other events were taking place at the same frame as Leiden charter. The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] was ratified by the UK 16 December 1991, and most of the rest of the world as well, except the [[United States]]. [[Somalia]] was the last state to finally ratified it on January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint statement on Somalia's ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child |url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_85718.html|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention not only dealt with the specific needs and rights of children, but also decided that states must act under the principle of [[best interests]] of the child, specifically in this context of not being separated from their parents. Signers are bound under international law. That is defined under Article 3 of the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |url= http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx |publisher=Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010-2018===
During the first two decades of the [[21st century]], the re-framing of the idea of family centred care to a child-centred care (CCC) approach was taking place.&lt;ref name="CarterBray2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Bernie |last2=Bray|first2=Lucy |last3=Dickinson|first3=Annette |first4=Maria|last4=Edwards|first5=Karen |last5= Ford|title=Child-Centred Nursing: Promoting Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Qg6AwAAQBAJ|accessdate=21 October 2018|date=14 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-9731-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The child centred approach is an evolution of family centred care, &lt;ref name="CarterBray2014"/&gt; but neither approach can exclude the other, with CCC recognising the critical importance of parents.&lt;ref name="ff"/&gt; The recognition of the idea of the child as active member and equal, meant the child was to be included in the care partnership, defining a conceptual relationship as ''child in family'' rather than ''child and family''. The relationship was not ''either/or'' but ''either/and''.&lt;ref name="ff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Lorraine M |last2=Leahey |first2=Maureen |title=Trends in nursing of families |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |date=February 1990 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=148–154 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.1990.tb01795.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The child-centred approach is cognizant of the fact that the child has their own ideas and can make choices, that are in the best interest of the themselves, i.e. being an active member in the partnership.&lt;ref name="CarterBray2014"/&gt; Recent research has show that children are capable of learning skills as healthcare members, the ability to effectively communicate with both health professionals and parents, defining goals, and using decisions to get the best possible outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pritchard Kennedy |first1=A. |title=Systematic ethnography of school-age children with bleeding disorders and other chronic illnesses: exploring children's perceptions of partnership roles in family-centred care of their chronic illness |journal=Child: Care, Health and Development |date=November 2012 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=863–869 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2011.01310.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although agreement on the definition of child centred care has proven elusive, some principles of child of the approach have been defined&lt;ref&gt;Principles underpinning child-centred health services, Department of Health, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

* Consider the ''whole child'', not simply the illness or condition.
* Treat children as children and young people as young people.
* Be concerned with the overall experience of the child and the family
* Treat children, young people and parents as partners in care.
* Integrate and coordinate services around the child's and families particular needs. 
* Graduate smoothly into adult service at the right time
* Work in partnership with children, young people and parents to plan and shape service and develop the workforce.

For much of the 20th century, healthcare has been one of the many contexts in which the child has disenfranchised, and denied their right to participation in their own care. With the release of the Platt report, this slowly changed, until family centred and later child centred care became well understood. However, even now the full recommendations of the Platt report have not been implemented. For example, where similar standards are in place, the co-location of children within adult wards is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Bernie |last2=Bray|first2=Lucy|last3=Dickinson|first3=Annette|last4=Edwards |first4=Maria| |last5=Ford|first5=Karen |title=Child-Centred Nursing: Promoting Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Qg6AwAAQBAJ|accessdate=21 October 2018|date=14 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-9731-5|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pollution]]''' is an [[Environmental issues in Canada|environmental issue '''in Canada''']]. It has posed [[Health effect|health risks]] to the [[Canada|Canadian]] population and is an area of concern for Canadian lawmakers. Air, water and soil pollution as well as the health effects associated with these three types of pollution, are prominent points of contention in modern Canadian society.

== Air pollution ==
{{main|Air Pollution in Canada}}
Air pollution in Canada is contributed by industrial and vehicular emissions, agriculture, construction, wood burning and energy production.&lt;ref name=World_Weather-Travellers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-weather-travellers-guide.com/air-pollution-in-canada.html|title=Air Pollution In Canada – Is It Possible?|publisher=World Weather Travelers Guide.com|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent report found that Canadian companies contributed 73% more to air pollution than companies in the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Canada Pollutes More Than Its Share|journal=Enviromation|year=2006|issue=37|pages=258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the 73% more emissions it was found that Canadian companies contributed 29% more respiratory toxins into the air than the U.S."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While Canadian businesses may release more emissions than those in the U.S, overall emissions have decreased in the past few years. This can be evidenced with Environment Canada's 2010 document named Air Pollutant Emission Summaries and Historical Emission Trends.&lt;ref name="Government of Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Air Pollutant Emission Summaries and Historical Emission Trends|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/inrp-npri/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=F98AFAE7-1#Highlights|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report found that 2010 emissions, when compared to 2009 emissions, saw an overall decrease.&lt;ref name="Government of Canada"/&gt; Additionally, it was found that heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (smog precursors) were at lower levels in 2010 than in 1990.

===Oil sands pollution===
{{further|Athabasca oil sands#Environmental impacts}}
While overall pollution levels have dropped, it was found that [[oil sands]] pollution has increased by 20% since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada leaves out rise in oil sands pollution from UN report|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/05/30/canada-leaves-out-rise-in-oilsands-pollution-from-un-report/|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=The National Post|date=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 study, Alberta’s oil sands are one of the major causes of air pollution in Canada.&lt;ref name="Timoney 2009 65–81"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timoney|first=Kevin|author2=Peter Lee|title=Does the Alberta Tar Sands Industry Pollute? The Scientific Evidence|journal=The Open Conservation Biology Journal|year=2009|volume=3|pages=65–81|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228662176_Does_the_Alberta_tar_sands_industry_pollute_The_scientific_evidence|doi=10.2174/1874839200903010065}} [http://cahr.uvic.ca/nearbc/documents/2009/Alberta-Tar-Sands-Industry-Pollute.pdf mirror]&lt;/ref&gt; Tar sands facilities were found to be among the top four highest polluters of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs)- a major air contaminant.&lt;ref name="Timoney 2009 65–81"/&gt; VOCs and other air contaminants are set to increase in the future as a result of continued output from the oil sands.&lt;ref name="Timoney 2009 65–81"/&gt; Oil sands pollution is not only set to increase VOCs, but also, [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oilsands to exceed Alberta's new pollution limits, say documents|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2012/09/11/edmonton-oilsands-pollution-acid-rain-limits.html|work=CBC|publisher=The Canadian Press|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid rain is rain that has been contaminated by airborne chemicals, making it [[acidic]].&lt;ref name=ECGCCA_AcidRain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/eau-water/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=FDF30C16-1|title=Acid Rain|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major causes of acid rain are [[sulphur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]].&lt;ref name="Briney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Briney|first=Amanda|title=Causes, History and Effects of Acid Rain|url=http://geography.about.com/od/globalproblemsandissues/a/acidrain.htm|publisher=About|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid rain can cause damage to soil, water, wildlife, plants and buildings. Additionally, the airborne particles that cause acid rain can also contribute to smog.&lt;ref name="Briney"/&gt; In recent years progress has been made in reducing acid rain, however, Alberta's oil sands may soon set back this progress.

===Pollution from oil wells===
In southeastern [[Saskatchewan]], air pollution from oil production has breached provincial air quality standards hundreds of times since 2014.&lt;ref name="Cribb"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cribb |first1=Robert |last2=Sonntag |first2=Patti |last3=Wrobel |first3=Michael |last4=Elliot |first4=P.W. |title=‘Off the chart’ air quality readings in Saskatchewan’s southeast raise new concerns — but little public warning |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2018/10/16/air-quality-readings-in-saskatchewans-oil-producing-southeast-raise-new-concerns-but-little-public-warning.html |accessdate=17 October 2018 |work=The Star |date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada/United States transboundary pollution===
In recent years, the Canada-United States [[Air Quality Agreement]], signed on 13 March 1991, has improved [[air quality]] by reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions in both countries.&lt;ref name=AGA_StateDepartment&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/oes/env/83011.htm|title=U.S. Canada Air Quality Agreement (AQA)|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was meant to address the issue of transnational air pollution between the two countries. The agreement was expanded in 2000 to also include goals of reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds and levels of [[ground-level ozone]].&lt;ref name=AGA_StateDepartment /&gt; Ground-level ozone is caused by reactions between nitrogen oxides and VOCs in the presence of sunlight. Ozone is a contributor to smog and is known to cause numerous [[respiratory diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/glo/basic.html|title=Ground-level Ozone Basic Information|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement Progress Report found that "Canada's total emissions of sulfur dioxide have decreased by 57% from 1990 levels while the U.S. has reduced total sulfur dioxide emissions from covered sources by 67% from their 1990 emission levels. Between 2000 and 2010, Canada reduced total emissions of nitrogen oxides by 40% in the transboundary ozone region while U.S. total nitrogen oxide emissions decreased by 42% in the region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement Progress Report 2012|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Publications/default.asp?lang=En&amp;xml=D9D6380B-4834-41C4-9D36-B6E3348F1A39|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While transnational pollution between the United States and Canada has decreased many Canadians still say they contend with polluted air as a result of drifting pollution from the U.S. In 2006 the government of [[Ontario]] announced that "5,000 premature deaths caused by smog in the province every year can be attributed to air pollution that crosses the Canada-U.S. border."&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|title=Canadian cities petition U.S. to curb air pollution|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2006/11/01/environmental-petition.html|accessdate=6 November 2012|newspaper=CBC|date=1 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the then (2006) mayor of Halifax, Peter Kelley, also proclaimed "over 50 per cent of air pollutants over New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are from the U.S. For us, we're trying to deal with what's coming our way, but also what we generate here as well."&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; In an attempt to combat the pollution a petition was created. In 2006 the petition was filed by thirteen Canadian municipalities to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calling for a reduction in coal-fired plants.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

===Climate Change Accountability Act===
The [[Climate Change Accountability Act (Bill C-311)|Climate Change Accountability Act]] called for [[greenhouse gas]] emissions to be 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. Although the bill was passed by the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], the bill was defeated by the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]]. Environment Minister [[Jim Prentice]] stated in early 2010 that the new goal for greenhouse gas emissions would be 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, the equivalent of a 3% increase from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadians.org/campaignblog/?p=2793|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100203170118/http://www.canadians.org/campaignblog/?p=2793|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2010|title=Prentice pledges emissions cuts 2.5% above 1990 levels|date=1 February 2010|publisher=The Council of Canadians|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water pollution==
{{see also|Water supply and sanitation in Canada}}
[[Water pollution]] is not a major problem nationally, although it can be a source of concern in some localities. Major causes of water pollution in Canada include acid rain, [[groundwater contamination]] and unclean [[wastewater]].&lt;ref name="EnvironmentCanada_Water"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.gc.ca/eau-water/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=E86BC86A-1|title=Water Pollution|date=30 November 2010|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil sands pollution===
As previously stated, Alberta's oil sands are set to cause growing levels of acid rain consequentially leading to an increase in water contamination in the area. Acid rain will cause Canada's lakes and rivers to become further acidified. This is a problem as it decreases levels of surface water calcium. This lower concentration of calcium is already having particularly adverse effects on plant life, as can be seen with the [[Daphnia]] species-an important food source for aquatic species and marine life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5906/1374.full|title=The Widespread Threat of Calcium Decline in Fresh Waters|date=28 November 2008|publisher=''Science''|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study at the University of Alberta found levels of metals like [[arsenic]], [[lead]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] to be considerably higher than national guidelines in water downstream from Albertan oil sites.&lt;ref name="The Ecologist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada tar sands industry ignoring toxic river pollution|url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/581400/canada_tar_sands_industry_ignoring_toxic_river_pollution.html|publisher=The Ecologist|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pollution could potentially result in harmful health implications for fish and other wildlife.&lt;ref name="The Ecologist"/&gt; The study further discerned that their findings were "contrary to claims made by industry and government" who purported that "pollutants are from natural sources and not from the expanding production of oil from tar sands."&lt;ref name="The Ecologist"/&gt;

Other than contributing to acid rain and high levels of metals in water, sites of oil production can also cause significant damage by human error and runoff. A prominent example is the 2007 case involving the [[Athabasca River]]. Due to human error, energy magnate [[Suncor]] spilled 9.8 million liters of oil sands waste water into the river causing adverse effects for people and wildlife in the area.&lt;ref name="Timoney 2009 65–81"/&gt; The Athabasca River can also be used as an example of oil sands runoff. It was found that the Athabasca's waters, which are downstream from the oil sands, had higher concentrations of pollutants as a result of runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prebble|first=Peter|title=Elevated Levels of Toxins Found Downstream of Oil Sands Operations|url=http://www.environmentalsociety.ca/main/blog-posts/elevated-levels-of-toxins-found-downstream-of-oil-sands-operations/|publisher=Saskatchewan Environmental Society|accessdate=8 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113085257/http://www.environmentalsociety.ca/main/blog-posts/elevated-levels-of-toxins-found-downstream-of-oil-sands-operations/|archivedate=13 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; High concentrations of pollutants can have serious consequences for wildlife and humans. Recently, it was reported that there were significant increases in fish deformities as well as an increase in cancer rates in a Native community downstream from the Athabasca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hume|first=Mark|title=Fearing water pollution, NWT towns call for oil sands slowdown|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/fearing-water-pollution-nwt-towns-call-for-oil-sands-slowdown/article1154313/?service=mobile|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Lakes pollution===
Pollution of the [[Great Lakes]], the world’s biggest bodies of fresh water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario's Natural Resources-Water and}}&lt;/ref&gt; continue to be a significant problem for both Canada and the United States. According to Derek Stack, executive director of Great Lakes United, "High pollution levels in the Great Lakes basin continue to take an apparent toll on the air and water quality of the ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Canada Pollutes More Than Its Share|journal=Enviromation|year=2006|volume=37|pages=258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2002, it was reported that the Great Lakes basin was home to 45% of all toxic air pollution in Canada, in turn affecting the Great Lakes' water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=NEW REPORT SHOWS GREAT LAKES BASIN GENERATES MORE THAN 1 BILLION KILOGRAMS OF AIR POLLUTION|journal=Enviromation|date=June 2005|volume=33|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; An even more recent report suggests that the Alberta oil sands' impact could reach as far as the Great Lakes.&lt;ref name="Mittelstaedt 2008 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mittelstaedt|first=M|title=Oil Sands Will Pollute Great Lakes, Report Warns|journal=Rachel's Democracy and Health News|year=2008|issue=980|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report warns that "[oil] refineries will be using the Great Lakes ‘as a cheap supply’ source for their copious water needs and the area’s air ‘as a pollution dump'."&lt;ref name="Mittelstaedt 2008 1"/&gt;

In September 2012, the United States and Canada signed  amended version of the [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]].&lt;ref name="Environment Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States and Canada Sign Amended Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=714D9AAE-1&amp;news=5A95C196-43F9-450D-97F1-7364665DDD3F|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching purpose of the Agreement is to "restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the waters".&lt;ref name="Environment Canada"/&gt; Significant amendments made to the Agreement include "address[ing] aquatic invasive species, habitat degradation and the effects of climate change, and support continued work on existing threats to people's health and the environment in the Great Lakes Basin such as harmful algae, toxic chemicals, and discharges from other vessels".&lt;ref name="Environment Canada"/&gt; However, some people contend that the changes made to the Agreement while good in principle, lack the "hard number goals, and actions to reach them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruce|first=James P|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/1257210--canada-u-s-great-lakes-water-quality-one-step-forward-two-steps-back|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=The Star|author2=Chris Wood|title=Canada-U.S. Great Lakes water quality: One step forward, two steps back|date=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arctic waters pollution===
Under the 1970 [[Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act]], the Canadian government established a document to [[Pollution prevention|prevent pollution]] of Canadian Arctic waters. However, in recent years Arctic waters have become increasingly polluted. It was recently found that due to pollution some waters have levels of lead that are higher than the Canadian guidelines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Land-Based Pollution in the Arctic Ocean: Canadian Actions in a Regional and Global Context|journal=Arctic|year=2008|volume=61|pages=111–121|doi=10.14430/arctic106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coastal communities that emit waste also contribute to arctic pollution. Arctic coastal communities do not presently have the infrastructure necessary to properly deal with their waste, this could lead to greater pollution in the future as these communities continue to grow in size.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Other than coastal communities, waste and litter from the rest of the world continues to be a significant issue in the Arctic, with waste levels doubling in the past ten years.&lt;ref name="upi.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arctic Ocean Pollution Doubled in 10 Years|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2012/10/23/Arctic-Ocean-pollution-doubled-in-10-years/UPI-70701351013668/|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=UPI|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant types of litter found are plastic items and plastic bags.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt;

===Pollution from sewage===
The Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality are guidelines for [[drinking water]] [[water quality|quality]] standards in Canada developed by Health Canada. These guidelines set forth recommendations for the maximum concentrations of various substances in drinking water. Provinces and territories are responsible for enforcing these guidelines, as there is no national regulatory body for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safewater.org/PDFS/PurposeofDrinkingWaterQualityGuidelinesRegulations.pdf|title=What is the Purpose of Drinking Water Quality Guidelines/Regulations?|publisher=Safe Drinking Water Foundation|accessdate=11 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006230543/http://www.safewater.org/PDFS/PurposeofDrinkingWaterQualityGuidelinesRegulations.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water pollution by sewage is one of the main culprits involved in polluting drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nakate|first=Shashank|title=Sewage Water Pollution|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/sewage-water-pollution.html|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy group [[Ecojustice]] estimates overall raw sewage dumping in Canada to be around 200 billion litres a year.&lt;ref name="MacQueen"&gt;{{cite news|last=MacQueen|first=Ken|title=Many cities still dump raw sewage|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/04/30/many-cities-still-dump-raw-sewage/|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=Macleans|date=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian government recently announced waste water regulations that would allow for sewage to be dumped into Canadian waters until 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harper Government Moves to Protect Canada's Water Quality|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=56D4043B-1&amp;news=A4B71B09-7A14-4546-BD48-5041D81B8DA8|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper measures for waste water disposal will not immediately be put in place, rather, they will be implemented gradually from 2020 to 2040. However, in the meantime, Canadian municipalities may continue to pollute their waters by dumping sewage. This can prominently be viewed with [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. In Halifax, human waste is dumped directly into the Halifax harbour.&lt;ref name="MacQueen"/&gt; This dumping can mainly be attributed to a failure in their sewage treatment infrastructure.&lt;ref name="MacQueen"/&gt; Victoria, British Columbia also follows a similar practice by getting rid of their untreated waste into the ocean.&lt;ref name="MacQueen"/&gt; However, the government has plans to open operational treatment facilities for 2016.&lt;ref name="MacQueen"/&gt;

Water pollution resulting from sewage can also be attributed to error in sewage facilities. A recent example can be evidenced with Ottawa. In 2004 Ottawa experienced a 190 million liter raw sewage spill into the [[Ottawa River]].&lt;ref name="Rennie"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rennie|first=Steve|title=Millions of litres of pollutants dumped in cities: analysis|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/823043--millions-of-litres-of-pollutants-dumped-in-cities-analysis|accessdate=27 October 2012|newspaper=The Star|date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Winnipeg, released "partially treated sewage water into the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] for seven weeks" in 2011.&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Bruce|title=City charged for putting partially treated sewage into Red River in 2011|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/City-charged-for-putting-partially-treated-sewage-into-Red-River-in-2011--175843071.html|accessdate=27 October 2012|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|date=25 October 2012|author2=Bartley Kives}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in this case, the city was actually charged for their pollution.&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt; Numerous other places like Richmond B.C and Calgary A.B, have experienced significant sewage spills in their native waters.&lt;ref name="Rennie"/&gt;

==Soil pollution==
{{see also|Soil contamination}}

While soil pollution is present in Canada, it is not yet an area of great national concern. Some of the main causes of soil pollution include chemical/oil spills into the ground, road salt, excessive pesticide use by farmers, acid rain, and polluted water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gresham|first=Tom|title=Brief Introduction to Water and Soil Pollution|url=http://greenliving.nationalgeographic.com/brief-introduction-water-soil-pollution-2137.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=29 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622120553/http://greenliving.nationalgeographic.com/brief-introduction-water-soil-pollution-2137.html|archivedate=22 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil degradation/pollution===
As Environment Canada mentions "soil degradation degrades the land and places significant stress on ecologically sensitive biota and flora".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protecting Canada's Boreal Forests and Northern Ecosystems:Developing Biological Methods to Assess and Preserve Canada's Soil Environments of the North|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/scitech/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=4B40916E-1&amp;xsl=privateArticles2,viewfull&amp;po=3AB28EB3|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil degradation in Canada's biologically sensitive forests as a result of pollution, is one of the most significant cases of degradation in the country. One study found that 12% of Alberta's forests’ soils are over their acid carrying capacity.&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Bob|title=Oilsands pollution exceeds official estimates:study|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/735399--oilsands-pollution-exceeds-official-estimates-study|accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=The Star|date=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rise in acidity is attributed to the continual extraction of fossil fuel from the Alberta oil sands.&lt;ref name="thestar" /&gt; Oil refinery sites, like those found in Alberta, have become some of the most dominant contributors to Canadian soil pollution. A further example can be witnessed in Calgary, where a neighbourhood built on an old [[Imperial Oil]] refinery needed their soil replaced due to contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alberta Demands Imperial Oil Replace Soil|journal=Daily Commercial News and Construction Record|year=2002|volume=75|issue=147|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road salt pollution===
As a result of Canada's icy winters, salt is needed in order to deice slippery roads. The primary ingredient of road salt is [[sodium chloride]].&lt;ref name="Swan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swan|first=David|title=Does Road Salt Pollute The Soil|url=http://greenliving.nationalgeographic.com/road-salt-pollute-soil-20074.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303013645/http://greenliving.nationalgeographic.com/road-salt-pollute-soil-20074.html|archivedate=3 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Road salt, while helping cars and people to gain traction in the winter, can have serious consequences for soil. As National Geographic found, "Road salt can pollute soil at every stage in the deicing process."&lt;ref name="Swan"/&gt; This pollution is a result of numerous factors such as runoff, application and spray from vehicles.&lt;ref name="Swan"/&gt; In Canada, there has been research that shows that "salt run-off from roads can increase local chloride levels to between 100 and 4,000 times normal levels."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite news|title=When the Ice Clears, Where Does All the Road Salt Go?|newspaper=The Times [London]|date=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt can have adverse effects on soil and soil composition. Significant levels of [[chloride]] (one of the main components in salt) can "alter the soil ‘s pH chemistry and elevate levels of heavy metal pollutants, while at the same time causing a loss of soil structure and killing off micro-organisms".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; These effects can have dire consequences for plants rendering them unable to grow or stunting their growth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===PCB pollution===
Salt and oil refineries are not the only contaminants of soil. [[Polychlorinated biphenyls]] or PCBs also pollute the soil. PCBs are released into the environment through "spills, leaks from electrical and other equipment, and improper disposal and storage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinn|first=Pat|title=Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)|url=http://www.idph.state.il.us/cancer/factsheets/polychlorinatedbiphenyls.htm|publisher=Illinois Department of Public Health|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently it was found that household weeds were able to remove PCBs from contaminated soil. A study found that "the weeds stored PCBs in their shoots and could be harvested for disposal cutting the need to expensively remove and incinerate contaminated soil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weeds Remediate Contaminated Soil|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T15916081734&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T15916081740&amp;cisb=22_T15916081739&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;selRCNodeID=141&amp;nodeStateId=29243001en_US56E8257609904D94976F126743B5E1E9,1&amp;docsInCategory=768&amp;csi=235906&amp;docNo=13|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects of pollution==
Pollution is associated with numerous negative health effects in humans.

===Air pollution===

Air pollution has been shown to negatively effect humans' cardiovascular and respiratory systems.&lt;ref name="Health Effects of Air Pollution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Effects of Air Pollution|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/air/out-ext/effe/health_effects-effets_sante-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=14 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227094216/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/air/out-ext/effe/health_effects-effets_sante-eng.php|archivedate=27 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lung tissue can be damaged with direct exposure to air pollutants such as ozone, potentially causing lung inflammation and impairment of lung function.&lt;ref name="Health Effects of Air Pollution"/&gt; As Environment Canada mentions "impacts from exposure can range from "minor breathing problems to premature death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of Air Pollution|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=D189C09D-1|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the main respiratory diseases caused by air pollution include [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], and [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Martin|title=Diseases Caused by Air Pollution|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/176670-diseases-caused-by-air-pollution/|publisher=Livestrong|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific cardiovascular disease and problems caused by air pollution include [[heart attack]], [[hypertension]], inflammation around the heart, [[stroke]] and [[arrhythmias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Pollution and Heart Disease, Stroke|url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/MyHeartandStrokeNews/Air-Pollution-and-Heart-Disease-Stroke_UCM_442923_Article.jsp|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health Canada]] estimates that 5,900 Canadians die every year from air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2005/05/02/air-pollution050502.html|title=Air pollution kills thousands each year: Health Canada|date=2 May 2005|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study by the [[Canadian Medical Association]] estimated that almost 3,000 Canadians die annually from short-term exposure to air pollution, while another 18,000 die annually due to long-term effects of polluted air. The study estimated the economic impact of air pollution to be at $8 billion, including lost productivity, health care costs, deaths and a decrease in quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/CMA/Content_Images/Inside_cma/Office_Public_Health/ICAP/CMA_ICAP_sum_e.pdf|title=No Breathing Room: National Illness Costs of Air Pollution|date=August 2008|publisher=Canadian Medical Association|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water pollution ===
Contaminated water can result in a myriad of serious consequences for human health.

Additives used to clean drinking water may cause themselves harm. [[Chlorine]], widely used in Canadian drinking water, is a prominent example. Through drinking water treated by chlorine over a long period of time, the risk of certain cancers, such as bladder and colon, increase.&lt;ref name="Drinking Water Chlorination"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking Water Chlorination|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/environ/chlor-eng.php#ho|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, pregnant women who drink significant amounts of tap water have an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="Drinking Water Chlorination"/&gt;

Drinking polluted water can also result in [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] (as found in the 2000 outbreak in [[Walkerton Tragedy|Walkerton]]), [[Giardia]], or [[Cryptosporidium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giardia and Cyrptosporidium in Drinking Water|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/water-eau/giardia_cryptosporidium-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Walkerton: Canada's Worst Ever E. coli Contamination|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2010/05/10/f-walkerton-water-ecoli.html|publisher=CBC|date=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soil pollution ===
Soil pollution also causes numerous diseases. Some of the most prominent are cancer, kidney disease, liver disease, [[dysentery]], skin infections, and stomach infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bichu|first=Divya|title=Diseases Caused by Soil Pollution|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/diseases-caused-by-soil-pollution.html|date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}
A '''preventive war''' is a [[war]] or military action initiated to prevent another party from acquiring a [[Offensive (military)|capability for attacking]]. The party being attacked has either a latent threat capability or has shown through its posturing that it intends to follow through with a future attack. Preventive war aims to forestall a shift in the balance of power&lt;ref name="S.M._Walt"&gt;Taming American Power, Stephen M. Walt, pp 224&lt;/ref&gt; by strategically attacking before the balance of power has had a chance to shift in the favour of the adversary. Preventive war is distinct from [[preemptive strike]], which is first strike when an attack is imminent.&lt;ref name="S.M._Walt" /&gt;  

Some commentators argue that a preventive strike undertaken without the approval of the [[United Nations]] is illegal under the modern framework of [[international law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQajT7Bqf-MC&amp;pg=PT97&amp;lpg=PT97&amp;dq=The+False+Promise+of+Preventive+War&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=26B_2EEmPQ&amp;sig=sZ8CyanswIdkYCQ5qshe-KT66mQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cX1qS83oGcW0tgeFydj-BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=un%20charter&amp;f=false |publisher = Oxford UP |editor1 = Henry Shue |editor2 = David Rodin |title=Preemption: military action and moral justification |chapter=The False Promise of Preventive War |author=Suzanne Uniacke |year=2007 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Robert Delahunty]] and [[John Yoo]] from the [[George W. Bush administration]] maintained in their discussion of the [[Bush Doctrine]] that these standards are unrealistic.&lt;ref name ="Delahunty-Yoo Bush Doctrine"&gt;The "Bush Doctrine": Can Preventive War be Justified, Robert J. Delahunty &amp; John Yoo [http://www.harvard-jlpp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/YooFinal.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocates==

Advocates of preventive war have ranged from [[J. Posadas#Nuclear war|Posadist Communists]], who argued for war to destroy capitalism, to western [[neo-conservatives]] such as George W. Bush and [[Donald Rumsfeld]], who argued that preventive war is necessary in today's [[Post-9/11|post September 11th world]].&lt;ref&gt;National Security Strategy of the United States of America - September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim it has been used throughout [[History of the United States|American history]] and is especially relevant in the present as it relates to unconventional war tactics and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The National Security Strategy advocates a policy of proactive counterproliferation efforts, and preventive measures.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Criticism==
There is a consensus that preventive war "goes beyond what is acceptable in international law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Law (6th edn)|last=Shaw|first=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Shaw|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Camrbidge|isbn=978-0-521-72814-0|page=1140}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lacks legal basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Public International Law|last=Brownlie|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Brownlie|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-921176-0|page=734}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the UN High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change stopped short of rejecting the concept outright, it suggested that there is no right to preventive war. If there are good grounds for initiating preventive war, the matter should be put to the Security Council, which can authorize such action.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/secureworld/report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The Axis in [[World War II]] routinely invaded neutral countries on grounds of prevention, and [[Invasion of Poland|began their invasion of Poland]] in 1939 by claiming the Poles had attacked a border outpost first. In 1940, [[Operation Weserübung|Germany invaded Denmark and Norway]], arguing that Britain might have used them as launching points for an attack, or prevented supply of [[strategic material]]s to Germany. Then in the summer of 1941, [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded the Soviet Union]], inaugurating this bloody and brutal land war by claiming a Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy threatened the Reich. In late 1941, [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|the British and Soviets invaded Iran]] to secure a supply corridor of petrol to the USSR. The [[Rezā Shāh|Shah of Iran]] appealed to U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for help, but was rebuffed on the grounds that "movements of conquest by Germany will continue and will extend beyond Europe to Asia, Africa, and even to the Americas, unless they are stopped by military force."&lt;ref&gt;''Sunrise at Abadan'', Stewart Richard pp 94–108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pearl Harbor===
Perhaps the most famous example of preventive war is the war in the Pacific, launched when Japan attacked military targets in [[Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org"&gt;J. Barnes, R. Stoll, "PREEMPTIVE AND PREVENTIVE WAR: A PRELIMINARY TAXONOMY", p.15, THE JAMES A. BAKER III INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RICE UNIVERSITY, [http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/Preemptive%20and%20Preventive%20War-1.pdf URL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123064942/http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/Preemptive%20and%20Preventive%20War-1.pdf |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many in the U.S. and Japan believed war was inevitable, this belief coupled to the crippling U.S. economic embargo that was rapidly degrading Japanese military capability led the Japanese leadership to believe it was better to have the war as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="bakerinstitute.org"/&gt;

The [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941 was partly motivated by a desire to cripple U.S. naval power in the Pacific in order to allow the [[Empire of Japan]] to advance with reduced opposition from the US when it, in order to secure Japanese oil supplies, fought the [[British Empire]] and the [[Dutch Empire]] for control over the rich East Indian ([[Dutch East Indies]], [[Malay Peninsula]]) oil-fields.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Crane, ''Imported oil and US national security'', p. 26, Rand Environment, Energy, and Economic Development (Program), International Security and Defense Policy Center&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, American policies and tension toward [[Military history of Japan#Showa Period - World War II|Japanese military actions]] and [[Japanese expansionism]] in the Far East increased. For example, in May 1940, the base of the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] that was stationed on the [[west coast of the United States]] was forwarded to an "advanced" position at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]].

The move was opposed by some Navy officials, including their commander, Admiral [[James Otto Richardson]], who was relieved by President Roosevelt.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} Even so, the [[Far East Fleet]] was not significantly reinforced. Another ineffective plan to reinforce the Pacific was a rather late relocation of fighter planes to bases located on the [[Pacific islands]] (like [[Wake Island]], [[Guam]], and the [[Philippines]]). For a long time, Japanese leaders, especially leaders of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], had known that the large military strength and production capacity of the United States posed a long-term threat to [[Japanese expansionism|Japan's imperialist desires]], especially if hostilities broke out in the Pacific.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} War games on both sides had long reflected these expectations.

===Iraq War (2003 – 2011)===
{{Main|Criticism of the Iraq War}}
The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] was claimed as a [[preemptive war]] by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. Supporters of the war have argued that it was justified, as Iraq harbored [[Islamic terrorist]] groups that share a common hatred of Western countries and was suspected to be developing [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD).

In support of an attack on Iraq, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] stated in an address to the [[United Nations]] on September 12, 2002, that the Iraqi "... regime is a grave and gathering danger."&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020912-1.html President's Remarks at the United Nations General Assembly, September 12, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite several years of occupation, the weapons of mass destruction he alleged were not found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7634313/|title=CIA’s final report: No WMD found in Iraq|accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="988">'''Salt equivalent''' is usually quoted on food [[nutrition]] information tables on food labels, and is a different way of defining sodium intake, noting that salt is chemically [[sodium chloride]].

To convert from sodium to the approximate salt equivalent, multiply sodium content by 2.5:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_\mathrm{NaCl}}{m_\mathrm{Na}} = \frac{m_\mathrm{Na}+m_\mathrm{Cl}}{m_\mathrm{Na}} \approx \frac{23\mathrm{u} + 35.5\mathrm{u}}{23\mathrm{u}} = \frac{58.5}{23} \approx 2.5&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38809">'''Senior dog food diets''' are [[pet food]]s that are catered toward the senior or mature pet population. The senior [[dog]] population consists of dogs that are over the age of seven for most dog breeds,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though in general large and giant breed dogs tend to reach this life stage earlier when compared to smaller breed dogs who are considered senior at a much later age. Senior dog foods contain nutrients and characteristics that are used to improve the health of the aging dog. [[Aging in dogs]] causes many changes to occur physiologically that will require a change in nutrient composition of their diet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laflamme|first=Dorthy|date=May 2005|title=Nutrition for Aging Cats and Dogs and the Importance of Body Condition|url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/S0195561604001871/1-s2.0-S0195561604001871-main.pdf?_tid=d0e74ada-ba60-11e7-9d4f-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1509031244_1d1d81a201707fe80bac30e75e283d30|journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice|volume=35|pages=713–742|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major change that occurs is the decrease in energy requirements&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is addressed by lowered caloric content of senior pet foods. Although energy requirements decrease, protein requirements increase as the dog ages. Senior dog foods include a higher [[protein]] content as well as highly digestible protein sources to deal with this. Nutrients included for joint and bone health include [[glucosamine]], [[chondroitin]], [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] fatty acids as well as two main minerals; [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]]. Sources of [[fiber]] included in senior dog foods include [[beet pulp]] and [[flax seed]] as well as [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS). These act to increase gastrointestinal health. Brain and cognitive health decline as the dog ages which leads to the inclusion of [[vitamin E]] and [[L-carnitine]] in senior dog diets to combat this decline. Skin and coat health can also decline in older dogs due to various reasons.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; The inclusion of [[linoleic acid]] as well as [[vitamin A]] into senior dog diets helps to improve or maintain the skin and coat of senior dogs. Immune system health is important to maintain in older dogs to prevent the development of various diseases. By including omega-3 and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids, vitamin E, [[Beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] as well as [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|pre]]- and [[Probiotic|pro-biotics]], the immune system can be boosted and maintained to help improve overall health. &lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Energy demand ==
The maintenance energy requirement (MER), or the energy that is required to maintain normal activity, decreases significantly as a result of [[lean body mass]] loss in aging dogs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The MER can decrease by up to 25% as dogs age due to this loss.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cliniciansbrief.com/sites/default/files/attachments/Nutrition%20for%20Senior%20Dogs.pdf|title=Nutrition for senior dogs: New tricks for feeding old dogs|last=Churchill|first=Julia A.|date=2015|website=Clinician's Brief|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basal metabolic rate is maintained by lean mass energy expenditure, which accounts for 96% of the function of lean mass.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The [[metabolizable energy]], or the amount of available energy which is left after the losses in urine, feces and combustible gas is subtracted, can be found on the food bag or calculated using the modified Atwater equation:

ME (kcal/kg) = 10[(3.5 x Crude Protein) + (8.5 x Crude Fiber) + (3.5 x Nitrogen Free Extract)]

This equation takes into consideration the amount of energy availability from [[crude protein]], crude [[fiber]], and the nitrogen free extract from pet foods in order to calculate the amount of energy the animal is receiving from the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall J.A., Melendez L.D. and Jewell D.E.|first=|date=2013|title=Using gross energy improves metabolizable energy predictive equations for pet foods whereas undigested protein and fiber content predict stool quality|url=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to consider the metabolizable energy content of senior or mature pet foods using this equation, as energy requirements will vary with age.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2244&amp;aid=2842|title=Metabolizable energy and caloric density|last=|first=|date=|website=Pet education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protein ==
{{Main|Protein (nutrient)}}
A dog's requirements for protein increases as a result of a reduced ability to synthesize proteins as it ages.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  As a result, it is extremely important to not restrict protein consumption to a senior dog as it can be as just as harmful as protein deficiency in young dogs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; To ensure good health, it is important to provide dogs with the 22 amino acids which they require. Of these 22 amino acids, 12 can be synthesized. The rest must be provided by good sources of dietary protein in adequate quantities. Good sources of protein include eggs and fish, which have a high biological value. This value describes the percentage of usable amino acids within the protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://happydogfood.com/blogs/news/dietary-protein-for-dogs-and-cats-the-importance-of-digestible-proteins|title=Dietary protein for dogs and cats - the importance of digestible proteins|last=|first=|date=November 8, 2016|website=Happy Dog Food|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recommended that a minimum of 2.55 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should be fed daily to ensure that protein requirements are met.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; It is important to understand that protein requirements based on weight are variable and that many factors influence the protein requirements of each senior dog.

== Bone and joint health ==

Joint deterioration occurs as dogs age. As their joints become less lubricated there is increased friction between the [[bone]] and the [[cartilage]]. With this increased friction, the cartilage deteriorates and wears away. The reduction of this cushion in the joints causes bone-on-bone contact to occur, causing the animal great discomfort. This can cause various related issues such as altered gaits and changes in activity levels resulting in a greater possibility of obesity and other conditions related to mobility and activity levels.

There has been research done in human medicine that indicates the positive effect that a combination of chondroitin sulphate and glucosamine can have on moderate-to-severe knee pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clegg|first=Daniel O.|last2=Reda|first2=Domenic J.|last3=Harris|first3=Crystal L.|last4=Klein|first4=Marguerite A.|last5=O'Dell|first5=James R.|last6=Hooper|first6=Michele M.|last7=Bradley|first7=John D.|last8=Bingham|first8=Clifton O.

It is important to note the effects of these supplements is not instant and the aforementioned studies showed approximately a 3-month period between the beginning of supplementation and the reduction of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/treatments/natural/supplements-herbs/glucosamine-chondroitin-osteoarthritis.php|title=Glucosamine and Chrondroitin for Arthritis|website=www.arthritis.org|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glucosamine ===
{{Main|Glucosamine}}
Glucosamine is a building block for the synthesis of cartilage tissue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-articles/understanding-dog-food/what-is-chicken-meal-in-dog-food|title=What is Chicken Meal in Dog Food? - Purina® {{!}} Purina|website=www.purina.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found naturally in the body, mainly in the [[Synovial fluid|fluid which surrounds the joints]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can help aging joints by maintaining the cartilage, thus reducing the pain caused by bone-on-bone contact within the joint (this is the primary source of joint pain in aging animals). This will increase the mobility of the dog which is vital for the maintenance of a healthy weight and general body function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vet-organics.com/blogs/news/pet-joint-care-part-two|title=What You Need To Know About Pet Joint Care: Part Two|work=Vet Organics|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been some studies which have showed [[anti-inflammatory]] properties of glucosamine which would also help joint function in aging dogs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Glucosamine is usually provided in supplements in the form of glucosamine sulfate, or by the inclusion of chicken meal in the diet, as it contains glucosamine as well as chondroitin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nutro.ca/en/natural-dog-food/nutro/dry/large-breed-senior-chicken-whole-brown-rice-oatmeal-recipe.aspx|title=NUTRO™ WHOLESOME ESSENTIALS™  Large Breed Senior Farm-Raised Chicken, Brown Rice &amp; Sweet Potato Recipe|last=Nutro|website=www.nutro.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Chondroitin ===
{{Main|Chondroitin sulfate}}
Chondroitin is a major component in the composition of [[cartilage]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It helps the cartilage retain moisture, lubricating the joint and allowing ease of movement of the bone across the cartilage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This reduces the damage to the cartilage over time. Chondroitin is produced naturally in the body but older dogs can often benefit from a supplemental dose of chondroitin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Chondroitin is commonly supplied as a supplement in the form of [[chondroitin sulfate]].

=== Omega-3 fatty acids ===
{{Main|Omega-3 fatty acid}}
Omega-3 fatty acids include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These two fatty acids have been shown to improve gait score and lameness in dogs with [[osteoarthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roush|first=James K.|last2=Cross|first2=Alan R.|last3=Renberg|first3=Walter C.|last4=Dodd|first4=Chadwick E.|last5=Sixby|first5=Kristin A.|last6=Fritsch|first6=Dale A.|last7=Allen|first7=Timothy A.|last8=Jewell|first8=Dennis E.|last9=Richardson|first9=Daniel C.|title=Evaluation of the effects of dietary supplementation with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids on weight bearing in dogs with osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|language=en|volume=236|issue=1|pages=67–73|doi=10.2460/javma.236.1.67|pmid=20043801|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Omega-3 fatty acid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have also been shown to have noticeable anti-inflammatory properties.

=== Calcium and phosphorus ===
{{Main|Calcium in biology}}	
{{Main|Phosphorus#Biological role}}
One of the most basic requirements of the aging dog’s body is the requirement for maintenance of their bones. In order for the bones to be able to heal from any injury or erosion, as well as maintain their strength to avoid these problem, they need a ready supply of calcium and phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/calcium-supplements|title=Calcium Supplements|website=vca_corporate|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are essential nutrients according to AAFCO guidelines, and should be included in a senior dog diet.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafco.org/|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials &gt; Home|website=www.aafco.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calcium]] and [[Phosphorus]] are also very valuable in the maintenance tooth health of dogs. In order for calcium to be properly absorbed into the body dogs will require another nutrient, [[vitamin D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parfitt|first=A. M.|last2=Gallagher|first2=J.

== Gastrointestinal health ==

=== Sources of Fiber ===

[[File:Sugar beet cossettes.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bowl of sugar beet cossettes.|Beet pulp is a good source of insoluble fiber.]]

==== Flax seed ====
{{Main|Flax#Nutrition}}
Flax seed is the whole seed of the flax plant which contains both soluble and insoluble fiber.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skaervet.com/documents/Common%20Pet%20Food%20Ingredients.pdf|title=Common Pet Food Ingredients|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insoluble fraction includes [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[lignin]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These components have a very good water binding capacity which aids in adding bulk into the diet of the dog.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This has varying benefits for dogs depending on their lifestyle.

===  Fructooligosaccharides and mannanoligosaccharides ===
{{Main|Fructooligosaccharide}}
{{Main|Mannan oligosaccharide-based nutritional supplements}}
[[Fructooligosaccharide]]s, commonly known as FOS, consist of many different types of indigestible [[oligosaccharide]]s.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanson, K.S., Grieshop, C.M., Flickinger, E.A., Bauer, L.L., Healy, HP., Dawson K.A., Merchen N.R. and Fahey G.G.

Constipation prevention and treatment can be carried out by the supplementation of FOS by its subsequent effect on gut bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS works in a different manner by effecting the attachment of bad bacteria in the gut of the dog.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These bad bacteria attach to the [[epithelial lining]] of the gastrointestinal tract and can cause the beginnings of [[pathogenic disease]]s.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS works to counteract these by preventing the binding of these deleterious bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

A study carried out in dogs determined that these two compounds when supplemented together can help with overall immune function.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is due to the decrease in overall bad bacteria and an increase in good bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. These two compounds also were not found to have any detrimental effects on food consumption, stool quality or stool output.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Brain and cognitive health ==
A dogs brain undergoes many pathological changes during the aging process. Some of these changes can include damage to the [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid), a decrease in the amount of [[myelin]] overlay on nerve cells as well as a buildup of [[protein]] in the brain which can potentially have toxic effects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Due to these physiological changes senior and aging dog can have possible impairment of proper cognition.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roudebush|first=Philip|last2=Zicker|first2=Steven C.|last3=Cotman|first3=Carl W.|last4=Milgram|first4=Norton W.|last5=Muggenburg|first5=Bruce A.|last6=Head|first6=Elizabeth|date=2005-09-01|title=Nutritional management of brain aging in dogs|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=227|issue=5|pages=722–728|doi=10.2460/javma.2005.227.722|issn=0003-1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impairment can include complex learning tasks as well as memory issues.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Vitamin E ===
{{Main|Vitamin E}}
The addition of Vitamin E as an [[antioxidant]] in senior dog food can have a positive effect on brain and cognitive health. Vitamin E is a [[Fat-soluble vitamin|fat soluble vitamin]] which works to prevent [[oxidative damage]] from occurring.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Reactive oxygen species]] can develop in the brain and can have a harmful effect by causing oxidative stress on the tissues if they are not subdued by antioxidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxidative Stress and Free Radical Damage in Neurology|last=Gadoth and Gobel|first=Nathan and Hans|publisher=Humana Press|year=2011|isbn=9781603275149|location=Totowa, New Jersey|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is thought to be the largest source of reactive oxidative species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] age their function declines which causes an increase in the production of oxidative species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Studies carried out in aging dogs looking at the effects of antioxidant supplemented diets have shown that older dogs supplemented with antioxidants including Vitamin E were able to correctly perform tasks more often than senior dogs whose diets were not supplemented.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It has also been shown that in senior dogs consuming these antioxidant enriched diets there was an increase in positive behavioural actions during the feeding period compared to senior dogs consuming diets that were not supplemented.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== L-carnitine ===
{{Main|Carnitine}}
L-carnitine is an [[amino acid]] and precursor of [[Acetylcarnitine|acetyl-L-carnitine]] which is a mitochondrial cofactor.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It acts to help with overall mitochondrial function as well as [[lipid metabolism]] which is an important function of mitochondria.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This is important as an increase in mitochondrial function will help to reduce the rates of oxidative reactions in the brain which overall decrease damage to DNA  and stimulates better cognitive function.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Skin and coat health ==
Several physiological changes in the senior pet can lead to a decline in skin and coat health.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bellows|first=Jan|last2=Colitz|first2=Carmen M.

Skin and coat health are important to upkeep as dogs age and there are many components in senior dog foods that can benefit this important area of health.

[[File:Soybean Oil, Meal and Beans (10059732523).jpg|thumb|alt= soybean oil, meal and beans.|Soybean oil is a good source of linoleic acid.]]

{{Main|Vitamin E}} Vitamin E is a key component found in dog foods for the skin to maintain elasticity and to replace old skin cells.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plevnin Kapun|first=A|last2=Salobir|first2=J|last3=Levart|first3=A|last4=Tavčar Kalcher|first4=G|last5=Nemec Svete|first5=A|last6=Kotnik|first6=T|year=2014|title=Vitamin E supplementation in canine atopic dermatitis: improvement of clinical signs and effects on oxidative stress markers|url=|journal=Veterinary Record|volume=175|issue=22|pages=560|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the anti-oxidant mechanisms of vitamin E it can prevent the formation of free radicals and in turn may prevent cancer cells from proliferating in senior dogs.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Vitamin E is found in both plant and animal products such as vegetable oil, dark red vegetables and liver.

=== Zinc ===
{{Main|Zinc}}Zinc is among one of many trace minerals recommended for dogs of all ages.&lt;ref name=":1122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marsh|first=K.|last2=Coe|first2=S.|last3=Ruedisueli|first3=F.|last4=Watson|first4=T.|date=2000|title=Effects of zinc and linoleic acid supplementation on the skin and coat quality of dogs receiving a complete and balanced diet|journal=Veterinary Dermatology|volume=11|issue=4|pages=277–284|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3164.2000.00202.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs experience loss of elasticity and dryness of the skin as they age.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; The addition of zinc in the diet aids in the development of collagen and wound healing, and also will prevent the skin from becoming dry and flaky.&lt;ref name=":1122" /&gt; Senior dogs can obtain zinc in their diet through the addition of various ingredients, including; red meats, whole grains, poultry by-product meals, and fish meals.

=== Copper ===
{{Main|Copper}}Loss of hair pigmentation is a common concern for senior dogs.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; Copper has been shown to improve coat conditions by reducing dry skin and improving the overall pigmentation of the coat.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewari, D.; Singh, V.K.; Gautam, S.; Dwivedi, V.|first=|date=December 2013|title=Nutritional dermatosis - a review|url=|journal=Intas Polivet|volume=14|pages=199–202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, copper may able to delay the natural aging process of the whitening of a dog's coat.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===&amp;nbsp;Riboflavin ===
{{Main|Riboflavin}}
Senior dogs require a larger amount of riboflavin for maintenance compared to adult dogs. Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, plays an important role as a cofactor for the [[Carbohydrate metabolism|metabolism of carbohydrates]]. Riboflavin is required in the diet to prevent cracking and dry skin, as well as a darkening of the pigmentation of skin.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spies|first=Tom D.|date=1943|title=The Natural Occurrence of Riboflavin Deficiency in the Eyes of Dogs|jstor=1671149|journal=Science|volume=98|issue=2547|pages=369–370|doi=10.2307/1671149|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riboflavin is also important for the vision of the senior dog as deficiencies can cause alterations in blood supply to the [[cornea]] which may lead to impaired vision and potential blindness.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; A source of riboflavin in senior dog diets is important to help prevent changes that aging can cause on skin.

== Immune system health ==
[[Immune system|Immune functions]] start to decline due to compromised ability to efficiently produce various [[protein]]s and cells that are important for the body's defense system as dogs age. [[Free radicals]] can cause [[oxidative stress]], killing the cells or impairing the functional capability of the cells, which leads to weakening of the [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puertollano|first1=Maria A.|last2=Puertollano|first2=Elena|last3=Alvarez de Cienfuegos|first3=Gerardo|last4=de Pablo|first4=Manuel A.|title=Dietary Antioxidants: Immunity and Host Defense|journal=Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry|date=1 July 2011|volume=11|issue=14|pages=1752–1766|doi=10.2174/156802611796235107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, providing dietary [[antioxidants]] can be an effective method to prevent the oxidative stress and support the immune system.

=== Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids ===
{{Main|Omega-3 fatty acid#Omega−6 to omega−3 ratio}}
[[Omega-6]] and [[omega-3]] fatty acids are very important for a strong healthy immune system and for preventing [[chronic disease]] in dogs. It is crucial in pet diets that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is properly balanced in order to achieve optimal health.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=R. C.|last2=Hall|first2=J. A.|last3=Gradin|first3=J. L.|last4=Du|first4=S. H.|last5=Jewell|first5=D. E.|date=June 1997|title=The ratio of dietary (n-6) to (n-3) fatty acids influences immune system function, eicosanoid metabolism, lipid peroxidation and vitamin E status in aged dogs|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=127|issue=6|pages=1198–1205|issn=0022-3166|pmid=9187636|doi=10.1093/jn/127.6.1198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recommended to have a ratio of 5:1 to 10:1, with there being more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3's. AAFCO has a maximum ratio listed of 30:1.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; For ideal health and decreased risk of low-grade chronic inflammation, it is more beneficial to have a lower ratio versus a higher one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein and Amino ACids (Macronutrients).|last=|first=|publisher=National Academy Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids have [[anti-inflammatory]] properties and therefore need to be supplemented in a closer ratio to omega-6's which are more [[Inflammation|inflammatory]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simopoulos|first=Artemis P.|date=2002-12-01|title=Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Inflammation and Autoimmune Diseases|journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition|volume=21|issue=6|pages=495–505|doi=10.1080/07315724.2002.10719248|issn=0731-5724|pmid=12480795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all of the omega-3 fatty acids that could be used, the most potent are found in [[fish oil]] in the forms of [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]], these have the highest immunomodulatory activities.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids tend to increase [[antioxidant]] requirements because they oxidize so rapidly, therefore when they are in a closer ratio to omega-6 fatty acids, as recommended, antioxidants must also be supplemented in the diet.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Vitamin E ===
{{Main|Vitamin E}}
Vitamin E is an antioxidant that can be supplemented in the diet in order to strengthen the effect of [[fatty acid]] supplementations.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; This vitamin works to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory markers that are found in [[synovial fluid]] of the [[joints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhouma|first=Mohamed|last2=de Oliveira El Warrak|first2=Alexander|last3=Troncy|first3=Eric|last4=Beaudry|first4=Francis|last5=Chorfi|first5=Younès|date=2013|title=Anti-inflammatory response of dietary vitamin E and its effects on pain and joint structures during early stages of surgically induced osteoarthritis in dogs|journal=Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=77|issue=3|pages=191–198|issn=0830-9000|pmc=3700444|pmid=24101795}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of this antioxidant, chronic inflammation can be avoided which aids senior dogs in maintaining a healthier immune system as well as helping to ease the symptoms of [[osteoarthritis]]. Also, formation of [[Hydrogen peroxide|{{chem|H|2|O|2}}]], which is a [[reactive oxygen species]] that suppress [[lymphocyte]] proliferation, can be decreased by vitamin E.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Jean A.|last2=Tooley|first2=Katie A.|last3=Gradin|first3=Joseph L.|last4=Jewell|first4=Dennis E.|last5=Wander|first5=Rosemary C.|title=Effects of dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids and vitamin E on the immune response of healthy geriatric dogs|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|date=June 2003|volume=64|issue=6|pages=762–772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===β-Carotene===
{{Main|beta-Carotene}}
[[Beta-carotene]] can be found in certain vegetables and it is a highly potent [[antioxidants]]. The number of [[T-cells]] is naturally decreased with age, leading to compromised immune function. However, in old dogs supplemented with dietary beta-carotene had no statistical difference in the amount of [[CD4+ T cells]] when compared to younger dogs.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Massimino|first1=Stefan|last2=Kearns|first2=Robert J.|last3=Loos|first3=Kathleen M.|last4=Burr|first4=John|last5=Park|first5=Jean Soon|last6=Chew|first6=Boon|last7=Adams|first7=Scott|last8=Hayek|first8=Michael G.|title=Effects of Age and Dietary β-Carotene on Immunological Variables in Dogs|journal=Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine|date=November 2003|volume=17|issue=6|pages=835–842|doi=10.1111/j.1939-1676.2003.tb02523.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also enhance cell-mediated immune responses and help prevent cancer.&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=David A.|title=Effects carotenoids on human immune function|journal=Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|volume=58|pages=713–718}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs supplemented with high dose of dietary beta-carotene may show red discolouration of feces and staining of hair.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HEYWOOD|first1=R|last2=PALMER|first2=A|last3=GREGSON|first3=R|last4=HUMMLER|first4=H|title=The toxicity of beta-carotene|journal=Toxicology|date=August 1985|volume=36|issue=2–3|pages=91–100|doi=10.1016/0300-483X(85)90043-5|pmid=4049434}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, toxicity level of beta-carotene in dogs is not clearly understood as dogs can also cleave beta-carotene into [[vitamin A]] in their intestines.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Head|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Rofina|first2=Jaime|last3=Zicker|first3=Steven|title=Oxidative Stress, Aging, and Central Nervous System Disease in the Canine Model of Human Brain Aging|journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice|date=January 2008|volume=38|issue=1|pages=167–178|doi=10.1016/j.cvsm.2007.10.002|pmid=18249248|pmc=2390776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prebiotic and probiotic===
{{Main|Prebiotic (nutrition)|Probiotic}}
Since the gastrointestinal tract is exposed to foreign materials from ingested food, a healthy [[microbiota]] in gut is very important component of the immune system.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kau|first1=Andrew L.|last2=Ahern|first2=Philip P.|last3=Griffin|first3=Nicholas W.|last4=Goodman|first4=Andrew L.|last5=Gordon|first5=Jeffrey I.|title=Human nutrition, the gut microbiome and the immune system|journal=Nature|date=15 June 2011|volume=474|issue=7351|pages=327–336|doi=10.1038/nature10213|pmid=21677749|pmc=3298082}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|Prebiotic]] and [[probiotic]] supplements can help maintain healthy gut flora.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Ping|last2=Swanson|first2=Kelly S.|title=Gut microbiota of humans, dogs and cats: current knowledge and future opportunities and challenges|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|date=21 November 2014|volume=113|issue=S1|pages=S6–S17|doi=10.1017/S0007114514002943|pmid=25414978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common prebiotic ingredients in dog foods are [[Fructooligosaccharides]](FOS), Mannanoligosaccharides (MOS), and [[beta-glucan]].

The temple of Maa Sheetla Chaukiya Devi is quite old. The worship of [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]] has been going on since times immemorial. History states that, during the era of [[Hindu kings]], the governance of [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]] was in the hands of Ahir rulers. Heerchand Yadav is considered the first Aheer ruler of Jaunpur. The descendants of this clan used to surname 'Ahir'. These people built forts at Chandvak and Gopalpur. It is believed that the temple of Chaukiya Devi was built in the glory of their clan-deity either by the Yadavs or the Bhars- but in view of the predilections of the Bhars, it seems more logical to conclude that this temple was built by the Bhars. The Bhars were non-Aryans. The worship of Shiv and Shakti was prevalent in the non-Armyans. The Bhars held power in [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]]. At first, the Devi must have been installed on a praised platform or 'chaukiya' and probably because of this she was referred to as Chaukia Devi. Devu Sheetla is the representative blissful aspect of the Divine Mother: hence she was called Sheetla. On Mondays and Fridays, worshippers come here in quite large numbers. Huge crowds gather here during the Navratris.

==Story About Devi ==
One story says [[Goddess Durga]] has incarnated as little Katyayani, the daughter of sage Katyayan to destroy all arrogant evil demonic forces of the world, in her real form as Durga, she killed many demons that were sent by Kaalkeya.

A demon named [[Jvarasura]], the demon of fever, started spreading incurable diseases to Katyayani's childhood friends, such as cholera, dysentery, measles, smallpox etc. [[Katyayani]] cured the diseases of some of her friends. To relieve the world from all fevers and diseases, Katyayani assumed the form of [[Shitala Devi]]. Each of her four hands held a short broom, winnowing fan, jar of cooling water and a drinking cup. With her power, she cured all the children's diseases. Katyayani then requests her friend, Batuk to go out and confront the demon Jwarasur. A battle ensued between the young Batuk and demon Jwarasur. Jwarasur succeeds in defeating Batuk. Then, Batuk, lying dead, magically faded into dust. Jwarasur was shocked that Batuk disappeared and wondered where he went. Then, what he doesn't know that Batuk has assumed the form of an awful male figure. This person was three-eyed and had four arms. He held a battle-axe, sword, trident and demon head. He was pitch-black in color. His hair was flowing. Eyes blazed with fury. This figure wore a tiger-skin and a [[Mundamala|garland of skulls]]. Batuk assumed the form of Lord Shiva's ferocious form, the terrible Bhairav. Bhairav reprimands Jwarasur and tells him that he is the servant of Goddess Durga (incarnate as Katyayani). A long discussion ensued but then converted into battle. Jwarasur created many demons from his powers but Bhairav managed to destroy all of them. Finally, Bhairav wrestled with Jwarasur and killed him with his trident.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7972">The '''Trim and Fit''' ('''TAF''') programme was a [[weight loss]] programme that targeted [[child obesity]] in [[Education in Singapore|Singapore schools]] between 1992 and 2007. Introduced by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore|Ministry of Education]], [[schoolchildren]] under the programme were educated on [[nutrition]], [[calorie]] control, and participated in intense [[physical exercise]] and activities.

==Overview==
Overall, the programme was successful in reducing the obesity rate amongst schoolchildren from 14% to 9.8% by 2002. However, it came at a psychological cost of participants being [[Shunning|stigmatised]] and in some cases, reportedly diagnosed with [[eating disorders]].&lt;ref name="afp-nus"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmafp/is_200505/ai_n14750552 Singapore schools' weight-loss programme linked to eating disorders: study], [[Agence France-Presse]], 24 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="st-nus"&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.sg/forum/2005/forum_letters/20050520.pdf School link to eating disorders possible]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Sandra Davie, [[The Straits Times]], 16 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theworld"&gt;[http://www.theworld.org/?q=node/14022 Obesity series part III: Singapore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725161240/http://www.theworld.org/?q=node%2F14022 |date=25 July 2011 }}, [[The World (radio program)]], 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The TAF programme has since been replaced by the Holistic Health Framework (HHF) which includes all schoolchildren.

==The programme==
The TAF programme was introduced into schools in 1992 as part of the National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign. It was a result of a 1991 review of the nation's health plan by a national committee. Students aged 9 to pre-tertiary education were required to undergo annual [[body mass index|BMI measurements]] and [[National Physical Fitness Award]] test (a precursor fitness test similar to [[Individual Physical Proficiency Test]] for [[National Service in Singapore|National Servicemen]]). The country's population at that time was showing an increase in obesity that became associated with health problems and loss of manpower for male conscripts in National Service, which caused many conscripts to be deemed unfit for deployment into combat service.&lt;ref name="timeasia"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/covers/501041108/obesity_singapore.html Singapore Shapes Up], Bryan Walsh, [[TIME|Time Asia]], 1 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was deemed by observers as an interventionist measure, requiring students who were deemed overweight to be subject to additional intense exercises or physical activities for at least one and a half hours per week. These activities were organised during recess or at times set aside before or after lessons at schools' discretion. They were also issued with "calorie cash" &amp;ndash; food ration coupons from which no more than a certain number of calories may be purchased and consumed in a recess break. The amount of calorie cash was inversely proportional to the child's obesity rate.&lt;ref name="theworld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp-taf"&gt;[http://www.singapore-window.org/sw05/050222a4.htm Schools making fat students thin, but emotional burden is heavy], [[Agence France Presse]], 22 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Children which exceeded the 160% of the ideal BMI were referred to the [[Health Promotion Board]] for follow-up action.

A direct impact of the TAF programme was a reduction of the obesity rate of schoolchildren from 14% to 9.8% by 2002.&lt;ref name="diab"&gt;[http://www.idf.org/sites/default/files/attachments/article_82_en.pdf Fighting fat: with TAF in Singapore] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124011620/http://www.idf.org/sites/default/files/attachments/article_82_en.pdf |date=24 January 2013 }}, Warren Lee, Diabetes Voice ([[International Diabetes Federation]]), May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide public health experts have evaluated the TAF model for possible replication around the world.

A carrot-and-stick approach was adopted in putting pressure on schools to meet the targets of fitness and obesity set by the ministry. Cash incentives were awarded by the ministry to schools that exceeded fitness targets and created new strategies to maintain students' obesity levels. Schools that failed had to face "consultation" sessions with ministry officials.  Schools were also ranked annually based on how well targets were met at national level.&lt;ref name="afp-taf" /&gt; Schools were given a wide discretion in determining how TAF was to be implemented, which resulted in some schools going so far as to implement [[apartheid]]-like segregation &amp;ndash; for instance, where children were grouped to sit at normal and overweight tables during recess.&lt;ref name="theworld" /&gt;

==Psychological factors==
Psychological motivation and [[peer pressure]] was emphasised in implementation of the programme, which formed the bulk of criticism of the programme as being insensitive and heavy-handed. Several TAF participants reported experiences of [[Shunning|stigmatization]], [[teasing]], [[physiological stress]] and lower self-esteem as they found themselves being singled out for being obese.&lt;ref name="afp-taf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap-scrap"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/20/AR2007032001145.html Singapore to Scrap Anti-Obesity Program], [[The Associated Press]], 20 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="st-huhf"&gt;"HuHF, it's not TAF to get fit", Samantha Eng, [[The Straits Times|The Sunday Times]], 24 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was also quickly pointed out that the name of the programme contained a negative connotation, as its reverse acronym was 'FAT'.&lt;ref name="afp-nus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="st-huhf" /&gt; Despite such criticism, education officials continually insisted that the programme was not out to stigmatise overweight children.&lt;ref name="afp-taf" /&gt;

In 2005, a [[National University of Singapore]] study of 4,400 schoolgirls linked TAF to an increase in [[eating disorders]]. It found that girls were more likely to have poorer relationship with their parents and their female friends. The findings correlated to a [[Singapore General Hospital]] study released a week earlier which found that instances of [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia]] increased six-fold from 1994 to 2002.&lt;ref name="afp-nus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="st-nus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/6/24/focus/20070624074044&amp;sec=focus Hell-bent on looking thin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521100012/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F6%2F24%2Ffocus%2F20070624074044&amp;sec=focus |date=21 May 2011 }}, Ng Cheng Yee, [[The Star (Malaysia)]], 24 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education quickly rejected these findings; claiming TAF was not a factor in the increase in anorexia.&lt;ref name="moe-nus"&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.sg/forum/2005/20050520.htm TAF students not at higher risk of anorexia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218064919/http://www.moe.gov.sg/forum/2005/20050520.htm |date=18 February 2008 }}, Ho Peng, [[Ministry of Education, Singapore]], 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, in 2007, the Ministry of Education decided to replace TAF with the Holistic Health Framework (HHF). The HHF intended to ensure the fitness and health of all schoolchildren.&lt;ref name="ap-scrap" /&gt;&lt;ref name="st-huhf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/spare-the-rod-and-correct-the-policies-that-cause-childhood-obesity/2007/04/11/1175971177269.html Childhood obesity's about good choices], [[Melinda Tankard Reist]], [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], 12 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Etymology===
[[File:Diwali sweets India 2009.jpg|250px|thumb|A tray of [[South Asian sweets]], with some pieces covered with shiny ''vark''.]]
Varaka means cloth, cloak or a thing that covers something else. Vark is sometimes spelled ''Varaq'', ''varq'', ''vark'', ''varkh'', ''varakh'', ''varkha'', or ''waraq'' ({{Lang-hi|वरक़}}, {{lang-ur|ورق}} {{IPA-hi|ʋəɾəq}}).

===Origin===
The tradition of using silver and gold foils to decorate food originated from the ancient [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] practice of using precious metals and pieces of pearl and conch shell in ''[[bhasma]]'' (medicinal ash).&lt;ref name=varq5/&gt; Varaka is mentioned in several ancient Sanskrit documents, particularly in Ayurvedic and medical literature. The word ''varaka'' is mentioned with ''swarna'' (gold), ''tara'' (silver) or ''rupera'' (silver) in these documents; the discussion is in three forms of these precious metals: ''patra'' (leaf), ''varaka'' (thin foil) and ''bhasma'' (ash). Ayurvedic documents consider silver as an antimicrobial astringent, while gold is claimed to be an aphrodisiac. This is not unique to Indian subcontinent; in Europe, edible gold (''Aureum potabile'') and silver were also claimed to have medicinal properties; later studies found that they can indeed be antibacterial owing to the [[oligodynamic effect]].{{Citation needed |date=October 2016}}

==The Verk product==
[[File:Silver Coated Spices By Shree Aditya Silver Leaves.jpg|250px|thumb|Silver Coated Spices]]

===Manufacturing===
Varak is made by placing the pure metal dust between [[Parchment paper|parchment sheets]], then pounding the sheets until the metal dust [[Molding (process)|mold]] into a [[Foil (metal)|foil]],&lt;ref name=varq5/&gt; usually a few [[micrometre]]s (µm) thick, typically 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm-0.8&amp;nbsp;µm. The sheets are typically packed with paper for support; this paper is peeled away before use.&lt;ref name="dlf"/&gt; it generally takes 2 hours to pound the silver particles into foils.&lt;ref name=varq1&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/62412082.cms ‘Chandi ka Warq’ business may become history soon], [[The Economic Times]], 8 Jan 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is fragile and breaks into smaller pieces if handled with direct skin contact. Those leaves in the 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm thickness tend to adhere to skin if handled directly. Vark sheets are laid or rolled over some [[South Asian sweets]].&lt;ref name="dlf"/&gt;

Particles were traditionally manually pounded between the layers of ox gut or cow hide.&lt;ref name=varq1/&gt; It is easier to separate the silver leaf from the animal tissue than to separate it from the paper. Due to the concerns of vegetarians population of India, manufacturers have switched to the modern technologies.&lt;ref name="dlf"/&gt; that have evolved for the production of silver leaves in India, Germany, Russia and China. Modern technologies include beating over sheets of black special treated paper or polyester sheets coated with food grade calcium powder (nicknamed "german plastic") are used instead of ox-guts or cow hide.&lt;ref name=varq1/&gt; [[Old City (Hyderabad, India)|Old City]] in [[Hydrabad]] use to be the hub of traditional manual manufacturing, where it is a dying trade.&lt;ref name=varq1/&gt; Modern machine based manufacturing hubs are based in [[Delhi]] and [[Noida]].&lt;ref name=varq1/&gt;

===Usage as food===
The silver is edible, though flavorless. It is also commonly used in [[Pakistan]] and India as coating on sweets, dry fruits (such as almonds, cashews, and dates), and in sugar balls, betel nuts, cardamom, and other spices.&lt;ref name=varq4/&gt; Estimated consumption of Vark is 275 tons (according to BWC-[[Beauty Without Cruelty|Beauty without cruelty]] data) annually (c. 2016).&lt;ref name=varq8/&gt;

Edible silver and gold foils on sweets, confectionery and desserts is not unique to the Indian subcontinent; other regions such as Japan and Europe have long used precious metal foils as food cover and also decoration, including specialty drinks such as [[Danziger Goldwasser]].&lt;ref name="dlf"&gt;[http://www.delafee.com/Edible+Gold+Creations_Information+on+edible+gold/ Gold in Gastronomy] deLafee, Switzerland (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetarian ethical issues===
Concerns have been raised about the ethical acceptability&lt;ref name=varq1/&gt; and food safety of Vark, as not all of it is pure silver (sometimes aluminium is used, which is toxic), nor hygienically prepared, and the foil nowadays commonly is beaten between layers of ox-gut because it is easier to separate the silver leaf from animal tissue than to separate it from paper.&lt;ref name=varq8/&gt; Due to the grinding effect of the hammering the animal intestine become part of the silver foil, which is sold in bulk.&lt;ref name=varq7&gt;Thanwardas Lilaram Vaswani, 1992, [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=ydJPAAAAYAAJ East and West Series], Issues 412-423, Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hindu]]{{fact|date=November 2018}} and [[Jain]] religions are mostly{{fact|date=November 2018}} vegetarian, this led to the decline in the usage of varq in sweets or [[supari]]s.&lt;ref name=varq7/&gt; [[Indian Airlines]] asked its caterers to not apply put varaq on the food supplied to ensure the animal intestine is left out of varaq.&lt;ref name=varq7/&gt; In 2016, [[Government of India]] banned the usage of animal guts or skins in the making of verk.&lt;ref name=varq8&gt;[http://www.dailypioneer.com/todays-newspaper/govt-slogs-its-guts-out-for-vegetarian-chandi-ka-vark.html Govt slogs its guts out for ‘vegetarian’ chandi ka vark], Daily Pioneer, 8 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Indian market for Vark has mostly converted to using the machine-based vegetarian process in the making of the silver foils. This directive was halted in 2017 as a result of job loss concerns.&lt;ref name="vark16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/delhi-high-court-stays-order-banning-use-of-silver-leaf-made-using-animal-material/story-91LxLGhwvJuMFabICzU74N.html|title=Delhi High Court stays order banning use of silver leaf made using animal material|date=2017-09-23|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Food Safety and Standards Authority of India]] has issued guidelines for the silver leaf manufactures to adhere to regarding thickness, weight, purity, labeling and hygiene of the silver leaf.&lt;ref name=varq8/&gt;

===Safety===
Gold and silver are approved food foils in the European Union, as E175 and E174 additives respectively. The independent European food-safety certification agency, TÜV Rheinland, has deemed gold leaf safe for consumption. Gold and silver leaf are also certified as [[kosher]]. These inert precious metal foils are not considered toxic to human beings nor to broader ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2012/07/the_666_gold_wrapped_douche_burger_is_it_safe_to_eat_gold_.html Conspicuous Consumption] L.V.

One study has found that about 10% of 178 foils studied from the [[Lucknow]] (India) market were made of [[aluminium]]. Of the tested foils, 46% of the samples were found to have the desired purity requirement of 99.9% silver, whereas the rest had less than 99.9% silver. All the tested Indian foils contained on average trace levels of nickel (487 [[Parts per million|ppm]]), lead (301 ppm), copper (324 ppm), chromium (83 ppm), cadmium (97 ppm) and manganese (43 ppm). All of these are lower than natural anthropogenic exposures of these metals; the authors suggest there is a need to address a lack of purity standards in European Union and Indian food additive grade silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Mukul|last2=Dixit|first2=S.|last3=Khanna|first3=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7605">'''WhizzKids United''' is a youth [[HIV]] / [[AIDS]] prevention, care, treatment and support programme that uses [[association football|football]] as an educational medium to facilitate healthy [[Behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]]. The programme is based in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]] and is run by Africaid, a registered charity in the [[United Kingdom]] (Reg. No. 1045461) and South Africa (Reg. No. 051-379-NPO).

==Background==

WhizzKids United was created&lt;ref name="Mirror" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McGilvray" /&gt; by Marcus McGilvray, a [[Wales|Welsh]] HIV nurse specialist who worked with the [[KwaZulu-Natal]] Department of Health on the [[HIV/AIDS_in_South_Africa#2003|ARV roll-out]]. The programme is rooted in the [[Social Cognitive Theory]] of behaviour and was developed over several years of practical experience working with adolescents in KwaZulu-Natal. Studies have consistently found that KwaZulu-Natal has the highest HIV [[prevalence]] of any province in South Africa, with approximately 25% of the population infected in the 15-49 age group.&lt;ref name="HSRCSurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoHSurvey"/&gt;

The programme was piloted in [[Edendale, South Africa|Edendale]]&lt;ref name="EDH newsletter" /&gt; in 2006 and later expanded to [[Umlazi]] and Jozini in KwaZulu-Natal as well as [[Rustenburg]] in [[North West Province]] and areas of [[Western Cape]] province. The U.K. arm of the organisation also runs programmes in [[Ghana]], [[Uganda]] and [[Australia]], as well as in the [[United Kingdom]] itself at [[Premier League]] youth clubs in partnership with the [[Football Foundation]].&lt;ref name="FootballFoundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CharltonAth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Onside" /&gt;

==Programme Overview==

WhizzKids United is an HIV prevention programme focusing primarily on Grade 6 and 7 students and consisting of three components. On the Ball is an eight-session curriculum which uses football drills and games to teach [[life skills]] interactively by using the game as a [[metaphor]] for life. This course is followed by [[peer education]] workshops focusing on sexual health. The long-term component of the programme is the Health Academy,&lt;ref name="HA" /&gt; a holistic adolescent-friendly sexual health clinic which offers free [[HIV testing]], [[Antiretroviral treatment]], Orphans and Vulnerable support and other services, along with recreational and educational activities such as football leagues and computer resource centres.

The programme recognises the [[HIV/AIDS_in_South_Africa#By_gender|gendered nature of HIV/AIDS in South Africa]] and as such includes gender equality as a central theme.&lt;ref name="Genderpaper" /&gt;

==Association with Football for Hope==

Since 2007, WhizzKids United has been a member of [[Street_football#2010|streetfootballworld]],&lt;ref name="sfw" /&gt; a [[Germany]]-based worldwide network of [[youth development]] through football projects. streetfootballworld implements Football for Hope, the social responsibility movement of [[FIFA]]. In July 2010, WhizzKids United participated in the Football for Hope Festival 2010 in [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]], an official part of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="FFH2010" /&gt;

In August 2010, FIFA announced that as part of the [[20 Centres for 2010]] campaign, FIFA has selected the WhizzKids United Health Academy in Edendale, KwaZulu-Natal to be one of the 20 Football for Hope Centres across Africa.

'''Women’s reproductive health in the United States''' refers to the set of physical, mental, and social issues related to the health of [[women in the United States]]. It includes the rights of women in the United States to adequate sexual health, available contraception methods, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The prevalence of women’s health issues in American culture is inspired by [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Overview of Women's Health since 1960's"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosser|first1=Sue V.|title=Overview of Women's Health in the U.S. Since the Mid-1960's|journal=History and Technology|date=December 2002|volume=18|issue=4|pages=355–369|doi=10.1080/0734151022000023802|url=http://www.swetswise.com/link/access%5Fdb?issn=0734-1512|deadurl=y|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this movement, women of the United States began to question the largely male-dominated health care system and demanded a right to information on issues regarding their physiology and anatomy.&lt;ref name="Overview of Women's Health since 1960's"/&gt; The U.S. government has made significant strides to propose solutions, like creating the [[Women’s Health Initiative]] through the Office of Research on Women’s Health in 1991.&lt;ref name="Overview of Women's Health since 1960's"/&gt;

==Issues==

===Sexual health===
The Department of Health and Human Services has developed a definition for sexual health in the United States based on the [[World Health Organization]]’s definition of sexual health.&lt;ref name="WHO Defining sexual health"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=World Health Organization|title=Defining sexual health: report of a technical consultation on sexual health|date=January 2002|pages=28–31|accessdate=25 October 2014|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/sexual_health/defining_sexual_health.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
“Sexual health is a state of well-being in relation to sexuality across the life span that involves physical, emotional, mental, social and spiritual dimensions. Sexual health is an intrinsic element of human health and is based on positive, equitable, and respectful approach to sexuality, relationships, and reproduction, that is free of coercion, fear, discrimination, stigma, shame, and violence.&lt;ref name="Dept. of Health and Human Services"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Department of Health and Human Services|title=CDC/HRSA Advisory Committee on HIV, Viral Hepatitis, and STD Prevention and Treatment|date=May 2012|url=https://www.cdc.gov/maso/facm/pdfs/CHACHSPT/20120508_CHAC.pdf|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The United States government recognizes that gender is a factor which plays a significant role in sexual health.&lt;ref name="Dept. of Health and Human Services"/&gt;

===Contraception===
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has identified national reproductive health goals including reducing the level of unintended pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Inapprop Use of CHC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jingbo|author2=Henry Hu|title=Inappropriate Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives for Birth Control Among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=595–603|doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the pregnancies reported in the United States, half are unplanned.&lt;ref name="Dept. of Health and Human Services" /&gt; Of the 62 million women in the U.S. who are able to have children, seven out of ten of these women are sexually active but do not want to become pregnant.&lt;ref name="Inapprop Use of CHC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jingbo|author2=Henry Hu|title=Inappropriate Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives for Birth Control Among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=595–603|doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3955}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contraception]] is a major issue of women’s reproductive health. 86% of sexually active women practice some form of contraception and 30% of these women use a hormonal form of contraception.&lt;ref name="Inapprop Use of CHC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jingbo|author2=Henry Hu|title=Inappropriate Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives for Birth Control Among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=595–603|doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the U.S. have more freedoms in deciding their use of contraceptives among other global nations, comparatively.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have significant pull over the decision-making process women must make when choosing different types of contraception. Women of the U.S. still rely on their healthcare providers for the majority of information they receive about contraceptive use. In order to help healthcare providers provide appropriate family planning care, the CDC published the US Medical Elibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use,2010.&lt;ref name="Inapprop Use of CHC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jingbo|author2=Henry Hu|title=Inappropriate Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives for Birth Control Among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=595–603|doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC lists methods of [[birth control]] under two categories: reversible and permanent.

====Reversible methods of birth control&lt;ref name="CDC Contraception"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|title=Contraception|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/Contraception.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;====

*Female sterilization
*Transcervical sterilization

====Hormonal contraception====
[[Hormonal contraception]] is the most popular method of contraception among women in the United States. Women under the age of thirty more commonly use hormonal oral contraception as their preferred method. Hormonal contraceptives can be almost 100% effective when used perfectly,&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in most cases it is used imperfectly. Oral hormonal contraceptives have an 8% failure rate.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of oral hormonal contraceptives among women changes over the course of a year with 32% of women deciding to discontinue use of an oral hormonal contraceptive after one year of typical use.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intrauterine contraception====
A large stigma exists among women on the topic of using an [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) as a form of contraception. The two types of IUDs that exist for current contraceptive use are Copper T 380A and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or Mirena. IUDs are underutilized by women in the United States with only 2% of women using IUD as an effective contraception.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of a contraceptive is described in terms of perfect use and typical use. An IUD is different than most forms of contraception, as it is 100% effective in both cases of use.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not possible to use IUDs improperly or inconsistently because they must be inserted inside of the uterus. Women in the United States have many fears about the use of IUDs, making them the less popular form of contraception.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many women in the U.S., IUDs are only an option when other traditional contraception methods have been used (hormonal birth control, barrier methods, etc.) or when a women has already had children.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear surrounding use of an IUD stems from a lack of proper education on all available contraception options available to women in the U.S.. Women have cited being afraid of the quality of the device itself, placing the device inside their bodies voluntarily, and the time required to hold the device in place.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of knowledge about female anatomy and pregnancy prevention, even among women of the United States.

===Sexually Transmitted Diseases===
A health objective of the United States government through The United States Public Health Service is to reduce the number of cases of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] from the 1980s to today.&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosher|first1=William D.|author2=Sevgi O. Aral|title=Testing for sexually transmitted diseases among women of reproductive age: United States, 1988|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|date=October 1991|volume=23|issue=5|pages=216–221|doi=10.2307/2135756}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centers for Disease Control is responsible for many studies on the topic of STDs as well as the effect of STDs on women and girls.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; STDs are defined by the CDC as “infections you can get from having sex with someone who has an infection”.&lt;ref name="CDC Women's Reproductive Health" /&gt; There are more than twenty types of identifiable STDs caused by bacteria, parasites, or viruses.&lt;ref name="CDC Women's Reproductive Health"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|title=Women's Reproductive Health|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/WomensRH/index.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one year in the United States there are an estimated 12 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases that occur. Of those 12 million cases there are 1.5 million cases of gonorrhea, 500,000 cases of genital herpes, and 110,000 cases of syphilis.&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"/&gt; Both women and men in the United States are affected by the STD epidemic. However, women have a stronger negative health reaction to some STDs than men. The negative health effects of STDs for women can include [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PIV), ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, fetal and perinatal infections, complications to pregnancy, fetal loss, cervical cancer, and increased risk of tubal pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery.&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the U.S. are less likely to seek out treatment for STDs for a variety of reasons. Some STDs appear asymptomatic in women&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"/&gt; therefore women are less likely to seek out treatment for STDs than men. Like most health topics, there is a gap that exists in understanding the pathology of diseases in women versus men. Women receive less than adequate information about the prevalence of STDs as well as the symptoms of STDs.

As with contraception in the U.S., a stigma exists which prevents women from learning about all possible STDs and their treatment. A study by the Journal of Women’s Health identified STDs as a topic women would rather not talk about.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, with their partners, do not commonly discuss STDs as well.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma surrounding STDs in the U.S. prevents women from discussing the topic even among healthcare provides, close friends, partners, and family. Younger women do not understand the risk that STDs can pose to them. For example, [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]] is one of the most common STDs affecting women and men in the United States. Women do not follow the recommendation that people should be screened for Chlamydia at least once per year.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most women do not even know any information about Chlamydia as an STD besides the fact that it is curable.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STD screening is most effective for identifying STDs in women, but is commonly underutilized by women in the U.S. Healthcare access and access to family planning clinics increases the probability that women will seek out and utilize STD screening.&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"/&gt; Screening is a form of testing healthy versus symptomatic people against traditional symptoms of STDs to determine STD prevalence. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has available clinics across the United States for the purpose of screening for STDs as well as other family planning services.
