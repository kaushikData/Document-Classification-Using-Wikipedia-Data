      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1217">The '''Anti-Gold Futures Act of 1864''' ({{USStat|13|132}}) was the first instance of United States Federal regulation of [[Derivative (finance)| derivatives]].  More formally titled "An Act to Prohibit Certain Sales of Gold and Foreign Exchange," the Act was passed by Congress on June 17, 1864.

It was a response to Congressional perceptions that the low value the [[fiat currency]] [[United States Note| greenbacks]] were then trading at relative to gold was as a result of a failure of the private market.  The Act prohibited the trading of gold [[Futures contract|futures]], and also criminalized  the sale of foreign exchange more than ten days in the future.  Congress's action was followed by a further sharp drop in the value of the greenbacks. Two weeks later Congress repealed the act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/Boarddocs/speeches/1997/19970221.htm FRB: Speech, Greenspan - Government regulation and derivative contracts - February 21, 1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audio forensics''' is the field of [[forensic science]] relating to the acquisition, analysis, and evaluation of [[sound recording]]s that may ultimately be presented as admissible evidence in a court of law or some other official venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan10/articles/forensics.htm|title=An Introduction To Forensic Audio|author=Phil Manchester|date=January 2010|publisher=Sound on Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maherieee2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maher|first=Robert C.|title=Audio forensic examination: authenticity, enhancement, and interpretation|journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine|volume=26|pages=84–94|date=March 2009|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4806208|doi=10.1109/msp.2008.931080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gelfandwired2007&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/10/audio_forensics |title=Audio Forensics Experts Reveal (Some) Secrets |date=10 October 2007 |author=Alexander Gelfand |publisher=Wired Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408153708/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/10/audio_forensics |archivedate=2012-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio forensic evidence may come from a criminal investigation by law enforcement or as part of an official inquiry into an accident, fraud, accusation of slander, or some other civil incident.&lt;ref name=maherasa2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maher|first=Robert C.|title=Lending an ear in the courtroom:  forensic acoustics|journal=Acoustics Today|volume=11|pages=22–29|date=Summer 2015|url=http://acousticstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lending-an-Ear-in-the-Courtroom-Forensic-Acoustics-Forensic-acoustics-deals-with-acquisition-analysis-and-evaluation-of-audio-recordings-to-be-used-as-evidence-in-an-official-legal-inquiry..pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary aspects of audio forensics are establishing the ''authenticity'' of audio evidence, performing [[Forensic audio enhancement|''enhancement'' of audio recordings]] to improve speech intelligibility and the audibility of low-level sounds, and ''interpreting and documenting'' sonic evidence, such as identifying talkers, transcribing dialog, and reconstructing crime or accident scenes and timelines.&lt;ref name=maherieee2009/&gt;

Modern audio forensics makes extensive use of [[digital signal processing]], with the former use of analog filters now being obsolete. Techniques such as [[adaptive filtering]] and [[discrete Fourier transform]]s are used extensively.&lt;ref name="gelfandwired2007" /&gt;

Recent advances in audio forensics techniques include [[voice biometrics]] and [[electrical network frequency analysis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8005">The '''Bridge House Estates''' is a charitable trust, established in 1282&lt;ref&gt;Sharp T: The Origins of the Bridge House Estates and Bridge House Trust: Guildable Manor pubs 2009: Home G: London Bridge - independent.academia.edu/TonySharp&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[City of London Corporation]] in [[London]], England. It was originally established to maintain [[London Bridge]] and, subsequently, other bridges. Funded by bridge tolls and charitable donations, the trust acquired an extensive property portfolio which made it more than self-sufficient. As well as maintaining the bridges, the estates also makes other charitable grants through the  '''City Bridge Trust''', their grant-making arm.&lt;ref name=cbtabout&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.citybridgetrust.org.uk/CBT/ | title = City Bridge Trust - About Us | publisher = City Bridge Trust | accessdate = 2011-08-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927175523/http://www.citybridgetrust.org.uk/cbt/ | archivedate = 2011-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of three funds managed by the City of London, the other two being the [[City Fund]] and the [[City's Cash]].&lt;ref name="R&amp;Q"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Simon|last2=Quinn|first2=Ben|title=City of London spending and income: where does the money come from, and where does it go?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/nov/01/city-london-spending-income|website=the Guardian|publisher=the Guardian|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was established, the trust has maintained, and on several occasions replaced, London Bridge. The trust also built [[Blackfriars Bridge]] and [[Tower Bridge]], and purchased [[Southwark Bridge]] from the toll-exacting private company that built it. Most recently it took over ownership and maintenance of the new pedestrian-only [[London Millennium Bridge|Millennium Bridge]], having provided a large amount of the funding for its construction.&lt;ref name=cbthist&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.citybridgetrust.org.uk/CBT/AboutUs/History.htm | title = City Bridge Trust - History | publisher = City Bridge Trust | accessdate = 2011-08-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111006211026/http://www.citybridgetrust.org.uk/CBT/AboutUs/History.htm | archivedate = 2011-10-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1995, the trust was permitted to use its income only for expenditure on its bridges. However, with a surplus of income over expenditure, a [[cy-près]] scheme was adopted in that year to allow any surplus income to be used for other charitable purposes benefiting [[Greater London]]. These grants are made though the City Bridge Trust.&lt;ref name=cbthist/&gt;

==Bridge House==
The Trust took its name from ''Bridge House'', which was the administrative and maintenance centre of Old London Bridge located on the south bank of the [[River Thames]], near the site of [[St Olave's Church, Southwark|St Olave's Church]] (since replaced by ''[[Olaf II of Norway|St Olaf]] House'' in [[Tooley Street]]). The site, now covered by the London Bridge Hospital and the Cotton's Centre, was constituted of at least two properties in Southwark. The first was that of Peter de Colechurch, the warden of the bridge from 1163, and probably a monastic dwelling. The second property was the house left by will of Henry Fitz Ailwyn, first named Mayor of London, in 1215.

The bridge became part of the City's jurisdiction from 1282, and this led to the City attempting to extend control over [[Southwark]], succeeding in acquiring the 'vill of Southwark' alias the [[Guildable Manor]] in 1327.

[[File:Sword rest TQ3280 427.jpg|thumb|City sword rest, formerly in the church of St Olave Southwark, and now in [[Southwark Cathedral]], showing the Bridge Mark]]
Known as the ''Bridge Mark'', the [[logo]] of Bridge House Estates is one of the oldest logos in continuous use and can be found carved into stonework in many places along the riverfront. It has been the identifying emblem of the Bridge House Estates for many centuries, but the latter now uses the [[City of London]] arms as an emblem. The City Bridge Trust uses the mark as a logo.

It was thought likely that the mark as we know it today was designed by a famous 17th-century surveyor, [[William Leybourn]]. It appears drawn on a plan of 1680 which it is thought he adapted from a similar mark drawn against plots owned by Bridge House Estates on an earlier plan of [[St George's Fields]] in Southwark. The City sword rest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/cities/london/st-martin-ludgate-a-wren-church/ceremony-and-commemoration.html Description of sword rests]&lt;/ref&gt; from the church of [[St Olave's Church, Southwark|St Olave, Southwark]] (now in the north transept of [[Southwark Cathedral]]) has the Bridge Mark carved onto it to balance the City's shield, and shows a date of 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp T: The Origins and Development of the Bridge House Mark: Guildable Manor pubs 2007 independent.academia.edu/TonySharp
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
The trust was established by [[Royal Charter]] in 1282, and the sole [[trustee]] is the [[City of London Corporation]]. The trustee does not own the property of the trust — it may only be used for the legitimate purposes for which the fund was created.

The Bridge House Estates are run by a committee of the City of London Corporation ("The City Lands &amp; Bridge House Estates"), the chairman of which holds the title of [[Chief Commoner]] and therefore cannot be an Alderman. The chairmanship is held for only one year as the responsibilities are so onerous.

In addition to its Royal Charter of 1282, the Bridge House Estates operates with respect to various legislative powers e.g. the ''Blackfriars Bridge Act 1863'', the ''Blackfriars and Southwark Bridge Act 1867'', the ''Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Act 1885'' for its maintenance role and for its general charitable role under the ''Charities (The Bridge House Estates) Order 1995'' ([[Statutory Instrument]] 1047), and the ''Charities (The Bridge House Estates) Order 2001'' (Statutory Instrument 4017).

==Finances==
Originally funded by [[toll bridge|tolls]] on London Bridge, the rents and leases of the buildings that were on it and also by charitable donations, the Bridge House Estates acquired an extensive property portfolio which made it self-sufficient.&lt;ref name=cbthist/&gt;

The Fund administered by the Bridge House Estates is solely responsible for the five City Bridges. There is no financial support from the Government or any other fund. If one of the bridges happened to collapse, the Charity would have to rebuild it out of the endowment. The good stewardship of the property and investments of the Estates by the City has led to the accumulation of surplus funds over any such demand on its resources. Therefore, the City sought from the Charity Commission to implement a [[Cy-près doctrine in English law|Cy-près]] scheme to extend its objects (purposes) since September 1995 to make charitable grants within the [[Greater London]] area.&lt;ref name=cbthist/&gt;

In 2003, total income of the Bridge House Estates was nearly £35 million (£{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|35000000|2003|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}}, and total expenditure and reinvestment was under £29 million (£{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|29000000|2003|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}}. The total funds held by the Estates are in excess of £500 million.

'''Broad Group''' is a private manufacturer of central air conditioning non-electric [[Absorption refrigerator|absorption chillers]] that are powered by [[natural gas]] and [[waste heat]] based in [[Changsha]], China. It is also the parent company of [[Broad Sustainable Building]], a [[prefabricated building|prefab]] building company. The company was established in 1996 and exports products to over 60 countries.&lt;ref name = "kpmg" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "UNEP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Champions of the Earth Official Site|url=http://www.unep.org/champions/laureates/2011/yue.asp|publisher=UNEP|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Shanghai Expo 2010]]'s only global official partner that was a Chinese private enterprise and the exclusive supplier of [[central air conditioning]], [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and [[air purifier|air purification products]] for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATIONS: The sayings of Chairman Zhang, a clean-tech entrepreneur's life in China|url=http://www.eenews.net/public/climatewire/2010/07/12/1|publisher=E&amp;E Publishing LLC.|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broad is one of the few Chinese manufacturing companies that has been widely recognized for its green policies and commitment to countering [[climate change]]. It has expanded its business in recent years to include other energy saving products and [[sustainable building]]s through its subsidiary Broad Sustainable Building, and achieved the feat of building a 15-story tall hotel in 6 days, which received 2 million views in the first 10 days after being released on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name= "CNN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video: China builds 15-story hotel in six days |url=http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/build-hotel-six-days-china-it-can-and-has-been-done-673433|publisher=CNN|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the firm succeeded in erecting a 30-story hotel in 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/play/time-lapse-video-china-built-30-story-hotel-360-hours-458199&lt;/ref&gt; 
==History==

===1988&amp;ndash;1992: The early years===
Born in Changsha in 1960, Zhang Yue was unable to attend school until he was nine years old thanks to the [[Cultural_Revolution|Cultural Revolution]], which temporarily shut down most schools in the country. 
Zhang Yue worked as a librarian and teaching drawing at primary school. Zhang Yue founded Broad in 1988, registering the company in [[Chenzhou]], [[Hunan]] province. Using his saving of $3000, Broad developed industrial boilers based on Zhang's patented design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Summary|url=http://www.broad.com:8089/english/about/qyjsread.asp?id=31|publisher=Broad|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980's most domestically manufactured [[Boiler|boilers]] were of poor quality and had high risk of exploding, while Broad's did not.&lt;ref name ="carnegie"&gt;{{cite web|last=Haffner|first=John|title=Zhang Yue: A Call for Discipline in a World Out of Control|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/000188|publisher=Carnegie Council|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His current wealth is estimated at $1,5 billion.

===1992&amp;ndash;2005: Move to Changsha and rise===
In 1992, the company was moved to [[Changsha]] and began manufacturing [[absorption chiller]]s. At the time, government provided incentives for non-electric chillers to relieve strain on the national electricity grid, contributing to the company's rise as it became the global leader in absorption chiller by sales in 1996; it entered the international market in 1998 and today, its sales in domestic and international markets split evenly.&lt;ref name ="carnegie" /&gt;

===2005-Present: From manufacturing to sustainable construction===
While [[absorption chiller]]s remain Broad's largest source of revenue, it now offers other environmentally friendly products including air purifiers and air conditioner terminals, with the BSB ([[Broad Sustainable Building]]) its latest invention in [[sustainable building]] technology, receiving more attention.

BSB, the building construction subsidiary of Broad group, announced plans to build [[Sky City One]], the world's tallest tower with a height of 838m.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/sky-city-chinese-company-proposes-worlds-tallest-building-098182?hpt=hp_t3&lt;/ref&gt;  The announcement made headlines not only for the size of the tower, but also for an audacious construction plan that involved completion&lt;ref&gt;http://inhabitat.com/sky-city-chinese-company-bsb-to-build-the-worlds-tallest-building-in-just-90-days/&lt;/ref&gt; in just 90 days.&lt;ref name= "Sky City"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fx5AVyHuds 800 meters in 6 months]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, BSB built a 57-storey [[Mini Sky City]] that stands at a height of 204m.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-3cca82c0-af80-4c3a-8a79-84fda5015115&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the tower took just 19 days.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Tower was built using pre-manufactured steel modules which are also going to be used in construction of the Sky City One.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

== Innovations==
Invented in 2009, the BSB achieves high energy efficiency and carbon reduction primarily through [[Building insulation|thermal insulation]], preventing cool air from leaving indoors and hot air from coming in from outdoors when the weather is hot and vice versa when the weather is cold, and requires short construction time since parts are pre-fabricated in factories and assembled onsite.&lt;ref name= "UNEPbuild"&gt;{{cite web|title=Building China|url=http://postconflict.unep.ch/publications/UNEP_in_China.pdf|publisher=UNEP|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], President of Mexico, [[Felipe Calderón]], commented the BSB technology to be ''a practical, imaginative, creative &amp; bold endeavor'' and ''a new revolution of world's architectural and housing industry'', which is bound to be transferred to developing countries leading to reduction in carbon emissions.&lt;ref name = "Cop16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech Delivered by Mexican President Felipe Calderón at COP16 BROAD Pavilion (excerpt)|url=http://www.broad.com:8089/english/down/Cancun01.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSB has also been tested to be able to resist a [[Richter magnitude scale|9.0 magnitude]] [[earthquake]] and was recommended in a [[United Nations Environment Program]] report on the rebuilding of [[Sichuan]] after its [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|catastrophic earthquake]] in 2008&lt;ref name= "UNEPbuild" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "feng" &gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Pavilion Built under 24 hours|url=http://phtv.ifeng.com/program/zjsbh/detail_2010_07/28/1847021_0.shtml|publisher=Phoenix Television|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Broad Sustainable Building ===

So far, Broad has built 4 demos of BSB, including: the 6-story Broad Pavilion in [[Shanghai Expo 2010]] in 1 day,&lt;ref name="feng" /&gt; the 14-story New Ark's Hotel in Broad's headquarters in 6 days,&lt;ref name= "CNN" /&gt; the Broad Pavilion in [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in 8 days &lt;ref name = "Cop16" /&gt; and a 30-story hotel prototype near Dongting lake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/t30-hotel-30-story-building-built-in-15-days/|title = Location of T30 hotel|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 15 days.&lt;ref name= "30-story"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdpf-MQM9vY 30-story building built in 15 days]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental record==

===Notable recognitions===
In May, 2011, Broad's founder and chairman, Zhang Yue, was awarded the [[Champions of the Earth|Champions of the Earth Award]] (Entrepreneurial Vision Category) by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] for Broad's commitment to climate change.&lt;ref name=UNEP /&gt; It was one of the ten companies to be recognized by the [[BusinessWeek]] Greener China Business Awards in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Businessweek Greener China Award|url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/05/0514_green_china_awardees/1.htm|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also named one of the "20 Most Admired Companies in China" in 2001, ’02, ’04, and ’05 by China's [[The Economic Observer|Economic Observer]] and [[Peking University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fallow|first=James|title=Mr. Zhang Builds His Dream Town|url=http://www.nd.edu/~powers/ame.50531/fallows.pdf|publisher=Atlantic Online|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusing to invest in electric chiller market===
In 2000, amid temporary company sales drop, and huge demands for cooling equipment of all kinds in China, Zhang was urged to enter the much larger market for electric air conditioners. Zhang refused citing that after successfully challenging himself to create wealth when the company was started, his current only motive was to  "save energy and reduce greenhouse emissions."ref name= "UNEP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Champions of the Earth Official Site|url=http://www.unep.org/champions/laureates/2011/yue.asp|publisher=UNEP|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "carnegie" /&gt; A [[Carnegie Council]] article cited a 2004 [[Peking University]]–[[Richard Ivey School of Business]] case study on Zhang's decision and reports  "''the authors argue that Broad would likely have gained "a significant market share" and earned "10 times" its production cost in this product area—but in doing so it would not have been able to "stay true to the company's environmental protection principles.'''" &lt;ref name= "carnegie" /&gt;

===Global involvement ===
Broad has been a member of the [[United Nations Global Compact]] since 2001&lt;ref name = "UNEP" /&gt;  and in October 2008, Broad formally joined [[The Climate Group]], being among the first group of Chinese global members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Climate Group Official Website|url=http://www.theclimategroup.org/our-members/broad-air-conditioning/|publisher=The Climate Group|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5377">The '''Brussels Conference Act of 1890''' (full title: '''Convention Relative to the Slave Trade and Importation into Africa of Firearms, Ammunition, and Spiritous Liquors''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bassiouni |first=M. Cherif |authorlink=M. Cherif Bassiouni |title=A Draft International Criminal Code and Draft Statute for an International Criminal Tribunal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W2ZrOHp3ojMC&amp;pg=PA405 |edition=2nd |year=1987 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=978-0-89838-918-0 |page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a collection of [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] measures signed in [[Brussels]] on 2 July 1890 (and which entered into force on 31 August 1891) to, as the act itself puts it, "put an end to Negro Slave Trade by land as well as by sea, and to improve the moral and material conditions of existence of the native races". The negotiations for this act arose out of the [[Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889–90]]. The act was specifically applicable to those countries "who have possessions or Protectorates in the conventional basin of the [[Congo Basin|Congo]]", to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and other powers or parts who were involved in slave trade in East African coast, Indian Ocean and other areas.

For example, Article 21 describes the zone in which measures should be taken, referring to ''"the coasts of Indian Ocean (including the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea), the Belouchistan up to Tangalane (Quilimane)... "'' and Madagascar. The Act provided for the establishment of a relevant International Bureau in Zanzibar.

In Art. 68, "the Powers recognize the high value of the Law on the prohibition of Slave Trafficing of blacks, issued by His Majesty The Emperor of the Ottomans on 4–16 Dec. 1889, and are assured that a surveillance action will be taken by the Ottoman authorities, especially in the western part of Arabia and on the routes that keep that coast in communication with other possessions of His Imperial Majesty in Asia." Similar actions were called on to be taken by the Shah of Persia and the Sultan of Zanzibar (Art. 69, 70).&lt;ref&gt;George Young. Corps de Droit Ottoman. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1905, pp. 192-206.&lt;/ref&gt; The participants also agreed to stop sales of guns and other weapons to Africans.&lt;ref&gt;G. N. Uziogwe, ‘European Partition and Conquest of Africa: An Overview’, in A. A. Boahen (ed.), General History of Africa, vol. vii, (Oxford, 1990), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The parties to the agreement were the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], the [[Congo Free State]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]], [[Spain|The Kingdom of]] [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], the [[Russian Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden-Norway]], [[Denmark]], the [[United States]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar]], and [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]].

The Brussels Act was supplemented and revised by the Convention of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] signed by the Allied Powers of the [[First World War]] on 10 September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/LNTSer/1922/19.html United States of America - Convention revising the General Act of Berlin, February 26, 1885, and of the General Act and the Declaration of Brussels, July 2, 1890, signed at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, September 10, 1919 &amp;#91;1922&amp;#93; LNTSer 19; 8 LNTS 27]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3876">Authored by State Senator [[Hannah-Beth Jackson]], the '''California Fair Pay Act''' (also known as '''SB358''') is an amendment to the existing California labor laws that protects employees who want to discuss about their co-workers' wages as well as eliminating loopholes that allowed employers to justify inequalities in pay distribution between opposite sexes.The bill is an extension of the California Equal Pay Act of 1949, which was originally intended to enforce equal pay.

==Background==

The California Equal Pay Act of 1949 (EPA) stated that "No employer shall pay any individual in the employer's employ at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex in the same establishment for equal work on jobs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/california-equal-pay-act-california-labor-code-11975|title=California Equal Pay Act - California Labor Code § 1197.5 {{!}} findUSlaw|website=finduslaw.com|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the vagueness of this law, employers are able to find loopholes and pay women in California much lower than their male co-workers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/California_Equal_Pay_Act.htm|title=California Equal Pay Act|last=DIR|website=www.dir.ca.gov|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, female workers make only 80 cents for every dollar earned by male workers thus putting the gender wage gap of 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.org/initiatives/pay-equity-and-discrimination|title=Pay Equity &amp; Discrimination — IWPR|website=www.iwpr.org|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 38.8 billion dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-equal-pay-day-20160412-snap-htmlstory.html|title=The gender pay gap: In California, it adds up to $39 billion|last=Kitroeff|first=Natalie|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is lost due to the wage gap between men and women. On October 6, 2015, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed the bill into law and the amendment took effect on January 1, 2016.

==Features==

The new bill is set to fix many of the previous law's issues by fixing terms such as "bona fide factor other than sex",&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB358|title=Bill Text  - SB-358 Conditions of employment: gender wage differential.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "substantially similar work"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and "same establishment"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; that have allowed employers to justify the wage gap. Before employers would rely on irrelevant "factors other than sex" to justify the wage gap. SB358 is set to alter the term "bona fide factor other than sex" defense with actual legitimate factors. It ensures to employees who perform "substantially similar work" but are paid differently to have equal pay. It also adds onto the "same establishment" clause that stated that men and women must be paid equally in same workplace establishment but now it is that men and women must be paid equally underneath the same establishment of work but they don't have to be working under the "same establishment" as employers have been able to justify lower wages despite males doing the same job at another company getting paid more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The key feature of SB358 is that it prevents employers from discriminating against its employees who seek to discuss, disclose, or inquire about their co-workers' pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/california-passes-law-aimed-bridge-gender-wage-inequality-gap|title=California Passes Law Aimed to Bridge the Gender Wage Inequality Gap {{!}} Littler Mendelson P.C.|website=www.littler.com|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68633">[[File:okterritory.png|right|thumb|350px|Oklahoma and Indian Territories 1890]]
The '''Cherokee Commission''', was a three-person bi-partisan body created by President [[Benjamin Harrison]] to operate under the direction of the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], as empowered by Section 14 of the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] of March 2, 1889.  Section 15 of the same Act empowered the President to open land for settlement. The Commission's purpose was to legally acquire land occupied by the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] and other tribes in the Oklahoma Territory for non-indigenous homestead acreage.

Eleven agreements involving nineteen tribes were signed over the period of May 1890 through November 1892. The tribes resisted cession. Not all understood the terms of the agreements. The Commission tried to dissuade tribes from retaining the services of attorneys. Not all interpreters were literate. Agreement terms varied by tribe. As negotiations with the Cherokee Nation snagged, the [[United States House Committee on Territories]] recommended bypassing negotiations and annexing the [[Cherokee Outlet]].

The Commission continued to function until August 1893. Lawsuits, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings, investigations and mandated compensation for irregularities ensued through the end of the 20th Century. Congress failed to respond to a legal protest from the [[Tonkawa]], or to an [[Indian Rights Association]] investigation that condemned the Commission's actions with the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Cheyenne and Arapaho]]. Commission attempts to negotiate signed agreements produced no results with the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Kaw (tribe)|Kaw]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]] and [[Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma|Ponca]].

The [[Dawes Act|1887 Dawes Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, Pritzker (2007) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; empowered the President of the United States to survey commonly held tribal lands and allot the land to individual tribal members, with the individual land patents to be held in trust as non-taxable by the government for 25 years.

==Indian Appropriations Act==

On March 2, 1889, President [[Grover Cleveland]] signed the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] into law. Section 14 of the Act authorized the President to appoint a three-person bi-partisan commission to negotiate with the Cherokee and other tribes in Indian Territory for cession of their lands to the United States.  [[Benjamin Harrison]] became President on March 4.&lt;ref name="IAA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Appropriations Act 1889, Sec 14|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/Images/v1p0341.jpg  |work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties |publisher=Oklahoma State University Library |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Appropriations Act 1889, Sec 15 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/Images/v1p0342.jpg |work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties |publisher=Oklahoma State University Library |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was officially named the Cherokee Commission, and its existence ended in August 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiorazzi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiorazzi|first=Michael|title=Prestatehood Legal Materials: A Fifty-State Research Guide, Including New York City and the District of Columbia|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7890-2056-7|author2=Most, Marguerite|page=941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 15 of the same Act empowered the President to open land for settlement.&lt;ref name="IAA"/&gt; On May 2, 1890, President Harrison signed into law the [[Oklahoma Organic Act]] creating the [[Oklahoma Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shearer |first=Benjamin F |title=The Uniting States: Oklahoma to Wyoming |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-33107-7 |page=977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organic Act for the Territory of Oklahoma|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/HTML_files/SES0045.html#p46|work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties|publisher=University of Oklahoma Library|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oklahoma Territory|last=Brown|first=Kenny L|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OK085.html|work=Oklahoma Historical Society|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=27 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114122835/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OK085.html#|archive-date=2011-11-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 1889, the Commission received its initial funding. Food, transportation and lodging were all compensated, plus $5 per diem. The commissioners received an additional $10 per diem while they were actually in service.&lt;ref name="H20"/&gt; Congress appropriated an additional $20,000 for the Commission to continue its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Secretary of the Interior|year=1891|publisher=United States government|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, Congress appropriated another $15,000 for the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; March 1893, Commission got $15,000 additional appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission organization==

The Cherokee Commission was to operate under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, [[John Willock Noble]], and his successor, [[Michael Hoke Smith]]. Noble's directive to the Commission was to offer $1.25 per acre, but to adjust that amount if the situation favored it.&lt;ref name="H20"&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucius Fairchild]] of [[Wisconsin]] was appointed the first Chairman of the Commission.&lt;ref name="H19"&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Fairchild submitted his resignation to President Harrison after the committee's first endeavor failed in negotiations with the Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H37"&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angus Cameron (American politician)|Angus Cameron]] of Wisconsin was appointed to replace Fairchild as Chairman of the Commission, and resigned after three weeks.  [[David Jerome|David H. Jerome]] of [[Michigan]] was appointed to fill the chairman vacancy.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The lone [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] on the Commission was Judge Alfred M. Wilson of [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John F. Hartranft]], recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Owens|first=Ron|title=Medal of Honor: Historical Facts and Figures|year=2004|publisher=Turner Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-56311-995-8|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former Governor of [[Pennsylvania]],  became the initial third person on the committee.&lt;ref name="H19"/&gt; Hartranft died on October 17, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; President Harrison appointed his friend Warren G. Sayre of [[Indiana]] to replace Hartranft.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribal agreements with the Commission==

===Iowa  – May 20, 1890===
The Iowa tribe is believed to have originated in [[Wisconsin]]. To avoid white settlers on their lands, the tribe moved to Iowa and Missouri, but later ceded their land and relocated to the Kansas-Nebraska border. In 1878, the full-bloods of the tribe moved to Indian Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=May |first=Jon D|title=Iowa |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/I/IO001.html|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 1890 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,'' submitted by Indian Agent Col. S.L. Patrick, the total [[Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma|Iowa]] reservation population was counted at 102.&lt;ref name="Iowa199"&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1890) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Reservation acreage was reported as {{convert|225000|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}}, west of the Sac and Fox reservation with comparable land. The population had members who were conversant in the English language, and some wore what was termed "citizens' clothes".  Income was estimated at $50 per capita annually.&lt;ref name="Iowa200"&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1890) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucius Fairchild and the Commission approached the Iowa on October 18, 1889, and were rebuffed.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1890, the Commission under David H. Jerome returned for negotiations, notifying the tribe of an October cessation to cattle grazing leases. Jerome told them the President was offering individual homesteads, and offering to take the resulting surplus land off their hands. Chief William Tohee stood firm that the Iowa preferred to keep their entire reservation for future generations. Jerome warned that failure to acquiesce would force the government to employ the Dawes Act. The Iowa felt that allotment and money was not good for the tribe, and they were still awaiting past government monies owed them. Many Iowa expressed concern about their children's forced assimilation in white schools, and were distrusting of the government. The Commission reiterated the threat of forced Congressional allotments. Jefferson White Cloud announced that the Iowa would sign the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 44–48&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 1890, at the Iowa Village on their reservation, the tribe signed the [[Agreement with the Iowa (1890)]] to cede all their land, in return for $60,000 (less than 27 cents per acre) divided per capita and paid in five installments, spread out over a 25-year period. The allotment was {{convert|80|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} per person. Land patents to the individual land allotted were to be held in a tax-free trust for the benefit of the allottees, for a period of twenty-five years.  The allotments were to be selected by the individual tribal members within 60 days of government agents initiating the process. If any member failed to make the selection within that time frame, the selection would be made for them by the special agent. Article IX of the agreement addressed the frail situation with Chief William Tohee and his wife Maggie. Due to his blindness and advanced age, the childless couple were to be paid $350 for their care and well-being.  Tribal member Kirwan Murray acted as interpreter. Congress ratified the agreement on February 13, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 319–322&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929,  the [[United States Court of Claims]] rendered a judgment that the tribe had been underpaid, due to irregularities. The tribe was awarded  $254,632,59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Court of Claims to the Iowa Tribe of Indians, Oklahoma|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol5/html_files/v5p0143c.html#p143c|work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sac and Fox – June 12, 1890===
The [[Sac and Fox Nation]] in Oklahoma. also called Sauk and Fox,  were moved to Indian Territory as a result of Article 6, in the Treaty with the Sauk and Foxes (1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1867 Treaty with Sauk and Foxes|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/sau0951.htm|work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the August 1890 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,''  submitted by Indian Agent Col. S.L. Patrick, the total Sac and Fox reservation population was counted at 515. Reservation acreage was reported as {{convert|479667|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}},  juxtaposed between the [[Cimarron River (Arkansas River)|Cimarron]], North Fork and [[Canadian River|Canadian]] rivers. It was in use as grazing, farming and orchards.&lt;ref name="Iowa199"/&gt; Living conditions were reported as [[tipi]]s or bark houses, with their main clothing being blankets. The Fox and Sac National Council was credited with uplifting the morality of the tribe by prohibiting [[polygamy]], and requiring lawful marriages.&lt;ref name="Iowa200"/&gt;

The Commission under Lucius Fairchild first met Moses Keokuk and the Sac and Fox in October 1889. Fairchild offered the tribe its choice of land for the allotments, and $1.25 per acre for surplus land.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; When Jerome assumed the Chairmanship, the Commission returned for negotiations on May 28, 1890. Principal chief Maskosatoe was in attendance, but Keokuk, who spoke no English, led the tribal negotiations through an interpreter.  Keokuk inquired about the allotment acreage and how much land the Commission wanted them to cede. Jerome cited the Dawes Act allotment directive of {{convert|160|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} to heads of household, {{convert|80|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} for single persons over 18 years of age, and {{convert|40|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} for persons under 18 years of age. Keokuk countered with {{convert|200|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} per person and a cession at $2.00 per acre.  Jerome balked at the suggestion. Keokuk and the Sac and Fox National Council forced the Commission to agree to {{convert|160|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} per person, regardless of age or marital status. The twist was that the Commission required land patents for only half the per person acreage to be held in trust for 25 years, with the other half held in trust for only 5 years. The deal would allow tribal members to sell half their acreage after 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

At the seat of government of the Sac and Fox Nation, the tribe signed the [[Agreement with the Sauk and Fox (1890)]] on June 12, 1890 to cede their land in return for $485,000 (slightly over $1 per acre). $300,000 of the total payment was to be placed in the United States Treasury, $5,000 to be paid to the local Indian agent to be expended under the direction of the National Council of the Sac and Fox, and the remaining $180,000 to be paid per capita within three months of Congressional ratification of the agreement. The allotments were to be selected by the individual tribal members within four months of allotting agents arriving to begin the process. If any member failed to make the selection within that time frame, the selection would be made for them by the local agent. The number of allotments was limited to 528, and any allotment over that limit would result in $200 per excess allotment being deducted from the $485,000. Congress ratified the agreement on February 13, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 323–326&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, in response to an appeal of the tribal claim, the United States Court of Claims ruled the tribe had been underpaid, and awarded them $692, 564.14.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizen Band of Potawatomi – June 25, 1890===
The [[Potawatomi|Citizen Band of Potawatomi]] were so named because of the Treaty with the Potawatomi (1887), which promised the band full citizenship in exchange for their agreement to move to a reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Treaty with the Potawatomi 1867 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/pot0970.htm |work=Kappler's Indian Affairs:Laws and Treaties |publisher=Oklahoma State University Library |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the United States Congress authorized the Potawatomi reservation to be in Indian Territory.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 1890 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,''  submitted by Indian Agent Col. S.L. Patrick, the total Citizen Band of Potawatomi reservation population was counted at 480.&lt;ref name="Iowa199"/&gt;  The reservation was reported at {{convert|575000|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}}, most of it between Little River and the South Canadian.&lt;ref name="Iowa200"/&gt; The band were reported as having white blood, almost all conversant in both written and spoken knowledge of the English language. They were reported as a wealthy populace. Allotments assigned by N.S. Porter had been happening for two years.&lt;ref name="Pot"&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1890) pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 1890, at Shawneetown, the tribe signed the [[Agreement with the Citizen Band of Potawatomi (1890)]] and ceded their {{convert|575870.42|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} for $160,000 (slightly less than 28 cents per acre) . An attorney had been engaged for the tribe during the negotiations.&lt;ref name="H56"/&gt; Many Potawatomi allotments had already been done in accordance with the Dawes Act. Land patents to the individual land allotted were to be held in a tax-free trust for the benefit of the allottees, for a period of twenty-five years. Those allotments, added to additional allotments were limited to a total of 1,400. The agreement stated that if additional allotments were needed, that $1 for each acre of land needed was to be deducted from the $160,000 paid the tribe, and divided per capita, for its land cession. After February 8, 1891, right to allotment ceased. Tribal member Joseph Moose acted as interpreter.Congress ratified the agreement on March 3, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 326–329&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the [[Indian Claims Commission]] awarded the Potawatomi $797,508.99, as part of its ruling that the land sold in 1890 had actually been worth $3 an acre.&lt;ref name="H57"/&gt;

===Absentee Shawnee – June 26, 1890===
The Treaty with the Shawnee (1825) provided for a reservation in Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty with the Shawnee 1825|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/sha0262.htm|work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shawnee who were living on the Oklahoma Potawatomi reservation were given the name [[Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians|Absentee-Shawnee]], because they were absent from the Shawnee reservation in Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Pamela A. |title=Absentee Shawnee |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/S/SH016.html |work=Oklahoma Historical Society |publisher=Oklahoma State University Library |accessdate=27 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805111003/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/S/SH016.html |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 1890 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,''  submitted by Indian Agent Col. S.L. Patrick, the total Absentee-Shawnee population was counted at 640.&lt;ref name="Iowa199"/&gt;  Their acreage was reported as being part of the Potawatomi reservation, on fertile ground between the North Fork and Canadian rivers. They were reported as having advanced to what was considered civilized clothing, living in log houses, and owning livestock. Populace was split between two bands. The Lower Shawnee under Chief White Turkey and the Upper Shawnee under Big Jim. Allotments assigned by N.S. Porter had been happening for two years.&lt;ref name="Pot"/&gt;

On June 26, 1890, at Shawneetown, The Absentee-Shawnee signed the  [[Agreement with the Absentee Shawnee (1890)]] and ceded {{convert|578870.42|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} for $65,000 (less than 11 cents an acre).&lt;ref name="H56"&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Big Jim of the Upper Shawnee refused to sign the agreement.&lt;ref name="H57"&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The Shawnee allotments were done in accordance with the Dawes Act, and limited to 650 allotments, including the allotments made prior to the agreement. If additional allotments over 650 were made, $1 for each acre of land therein was to be deducted from the $65,000 paid the tribe. Tribal members had until January 1, 1891 to select their allotments. If any member failed to make the selection within that time frame, the selection would be made for them by the local agent by February 8, 1891. After that date, right to allotment ceased. Land patents to the individual land allotted were to be held in a tax-free trust for the benefit of the allottees, for a period of twenty-five years.Tribal member Thomas W. Alford acted as interpreter.Congress ratified the agreement on March 3, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 329–331&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that only the Potawatomi had proprietary rights to the reservation land ceded in 1890, so the Absentee-Shawnee were unable to share in the 1968 award for under payment.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheyenne and Arapaho – October 1890===
The 1851 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] set the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes|Cheyenne and Arapaho]] boundaries as between the North Platte and the Arkansas rivers in Colorado. The 1861 [[Treaty of Fort Wise]] ceded most of the tribal land from the 1851 treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Omer C|title=Peyote Religion: A History|year=1993|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2457-5|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1865 Treaty of Little Arkansas, the tribes were removed to the southern boundary of Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1861 Treaty of Little Arkansas|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/pgimages/com0893.jpg|work=Kappler's Indian Affairs:Laws and Treaties|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Medicine Lodge]], signed by the southern Arapaho and Cheyenne on October 28, 1867, assigned the two tribes to live on the same reservation within the Cherokee Outlet, and also stipulated that any land cession required the signature of three-fourths of all the adult males of the reservation population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brill|first=Charles J|title=Custer, Black Kettle, and the Fight on the Washita|year=1938|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3416-1|pages=277–288|chapter=Appendix C-Medicine Lodge Treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Luebering |first=JE |title=Native American History |year=2010 |publisher=Britannica Educational |isbn=978-1-61530-265-9 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 1890 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,''   submitted by Indian Agent Charles F. Ashley, the total reservation population was Cheyenne 2, 272 and Arapaho 1,100. There had been much trouble with the [[Dog Soldiers]] preventing rations being issued to those who allowed their children to be enrolled in school.&lt;ref name="Iowa178"&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1890) pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghost Dance religion, as practiced by a [[Northern Paiute]] named [[Wovoka]] made its influence felt among the Arapaho at this time. Wovoka was the son of a prophet named Tavibo, and according to historian James Mooney, was considered "The Messiah" of the Ghost Dance.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney (1991), p. 764&lt;/ref&gt; The Cheyenne first learned about this Messiah in 1889. He was alleged to live near the [[Shoshone people|Shoshone]] in [[Wyoming]] and would bring back the buffalo and remove the white people from tribal land. A delegation led by [[Porcupine (Cheyenne)|Porcupine]] was sent to observe the Ghost Dance. In his account upon their return, Porcupine had become a full believer in both the Messiah and the dance. When questioned by the military authority, Porcupine gave a total accounting, but Mooney notes that in his enthusiasm, Porcupine might have embellished a bit.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney (1991), pp. 817–819&lt;/ref&gt; Some abandoned their work in favor of the dancing. Agent Ashley tried to put a halt to it.&lt;ref&gt;Berthrong (1992) pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 1890, the Commission held a preliminary meeting with Old Crow, Whirlwind and Little Medicine, all opposed to cession. Jerome received instructions from Noble to follow the Treaty of Medicine Lodge directive in getting three-fourths of adult males to sign the agreement. On July 7, the Commission opened negotiations with the 1887 Dawes Act, which empowered the President to make allotments. The tribes refused to negotiate, citing their land as having been given to them by the Great Spirit and by the terms of the Treaty of Medicine Lodge. At the July 9 meeting, Sayre presented the Commission's proposal and told the tribes they, "...will be the richest people on earth." The crowd balked.&lt;ref&gt;Berthrong (1992) pp. 150–152&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, Jerome threatened the government's right to cut off rations. The Cheyenne began boycotting the sessions on July 15. Both Jerome and Sayre threatened them with the Dawes Act.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, the Arapaho Army scouts walked out of the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Berthrong (1992) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Howling Wolf Cheyenne.jpg|thumb|left|Howling Wolf]]
Jerome, Sayre and Noble met in New York to agree on requests for the President: 1) Amend the Dawes Act to implement a time limit for acceptance; 2) Forbid outside cattle on the land; and 3) Cancel the attorney contracts if the attorneys were influencing the tribal resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Noble learned that Cheyenne chiefs Whirlwind, Old Crow, Little Medicine, Howling Wolf and Little Big Jake were in disagreement with the Commission over the attorney contract. On October 7, the Cheyennes boycotted the negotiations, and the Arapaho refused to continue.&lt;ref name="B164165"&gt;Berthrong (1992) pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;

Collecting of signatures began in Darlington, on October 13. By November 12, Noble declared sufficient signatures for the [[Agreement with the Cheyenne and Arapaho (1890)]]. Tribal members complained of fraud, citing signatures of women and underage males counted. It was also alleged that rather than counting the number of signatures separately by tribe, the Commission had used the aggregate total halved.&lt;ref&gt;Berthrong (1992) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the terms of the agreement signed October 1890, the tribes were to receive $1,500,000. Two payments were to be $250,000 each, and the remaining $1,000,000 to be retained by the Treasury of the United States at five percent interest. Allotments of {{convert|160|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} per person were to be selected by the individual tribal members within 90 days of Congressional ratification of the agreement. Failed to make the selection within the time frame, would cede selection for them to the local agent. Land patents to the individual land allotted were to be held in a tax-free trust for the benefit of the allottees, for a period of twenty-five years. Congress ratified the agreement on March 3, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 331–334&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribal attorneys====
Former Indian agents John D. Miles and D.B. Dwyer,  Secretary Noble's law firm associate M.J. Reynolds, and former Kansas Governor [[Samuel J. Crawford]] were contracted by the tribes, and approved by Secretary Noble, to represent the Cheyenne and Arapho.&lt;ref&gt;Berthrong (1992) pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt;  Their original fees were 10% of the cession agreement, deducted from the second cash installment paid to the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome questioned the wisdom of having attorneys whom the tribes distrusted as acting solely in the government's interest. Noble and the attorneys revised their contracts to adjust the 10% commission to a sliding scale.&lt;ref name="B164165"/&gt; When the tribes refused to deal with contracted attorneys, the team of lawyers mainly assisted with the gathering of signatures to approve the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  The government deducted $67,000 for attorneys fees from the 1892 second installment payment to the Cheyenne and Arapaho.&lt;ref name="H80-82"&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 80–82&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribal claims====
The deduction for attorney fees, led the tribes to address the grievance to the government. Among their supporters were John H. Seger, former Indian agent Captain J.M. Lee, and Charles Painter of the [[Indian Rights Association]]. Painter's investigative findings were published by the Indian Rights Association in 1893 as ''Cheyennes and Araphos Revisited and a Statement of Their Contract with Attorneys''. Therein, Captain Lee accused the contractual arrangement as being  "...misrepresentation, fraud and bribery." Painter also accused the attorneys of bribery, and of causing the tribes to lose three-fourths of the value of their land. As a result of the investigation, Congress did nothing. In 1951, the tribes brought suit against the United States, through the [[Indian Claims Commission]]. The findings were that the {{convert|51210000|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} involved were worth $23,500,000 at the time of the agreement. The tribes reached a settlement with the government in the amount of $15,000,000.&lt;ref name="H80-82"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berthrong (1992) pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wichita and affiliated bands – June 4, 1891===
Article 9 of the Treaty with the [[Choctaw]] and Chickasaw (1855) provided for the United States to lease the area between the 98th and 100th Meridians and the South Canadian River and Red River, for the purpose of permanent settlement of the [[Wichita people|Wichita]] and other tribes, and became officially titled the Leased District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty with the Choctaw and Chickasaw 1855|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cho0706.htm#mn16|work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prucha|first=Francis Paul|title=American Indian Treaties: The History of a Political Anomaly|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20895-7|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Civil War, Article 3 of the Treaty with the [[Choctaw]] and Chickasaw (1866) ceded the Leased District to the United States for the sum of $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty with the Choctaw and Chickasaw 1866|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cho0918.htm#mn3|work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robert Goins|first=Charles Robert|title=The Historical Atlas of Oklahoma|year=2011|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3483-3|author2=Goble, Danney |author3=Anderson, James H |author4= Morris, John Wesley |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1867, the Kiowa and Comanche received reservations in the district.

The agreement was never ratified by Congress, and the Wichita claim to the acreage would become a point of legal dispute with the [[Choctaw]] and Chickasaw upon the signing of the Commission agreement with the Wichita.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pool|first=Carolyn Garrett|title=Wichita|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/W/WI001.html|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 1890 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,''   submitted by Indian Agent Charles E. Adams, the total Wichita reservation population of 991 was divided into six bands: 174 Wichitas, 538 [[Caddo]], 150 [[Tawakoni]],  66 [[Kichai people|Kichai]], 95 [[Delaware Nation|Delaware]] and 34 [[Waco tribe|Waco]].&lt;ref name="Wichita187"&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1890) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission opened negotiations with the Wichita on May 9, 1891, by presenting the dictates of the Dawes Act, and asking the Wichita to commit to cession. David Jerome was immediately challenged by Tawakoni Jim, who argued for an attorney to represent the tribes. Jerome tried to dissuade the idea as a waste of money and time.  Tawakoni Jim also challenged the acreage being offered under allotments. Caddo Jake stated that the priority should be educating the children before any negotiations could take place.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Comments from tribal members reflected on the distrust of the government's word, based on broken treaty promises of the past. Caddo Jake made reference to the indigenous people's experience with [[Christopher Columbus]], which provoked a retort from Jerome that Christopher Columbus had never been on the North American continent. Caddo Jake would also draw the parallel between the crucifixion of [[Jesus Christ]] and the American tribes. Sayre presented a Commission proposal that was the standard {{convert|160|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} allotment, and a payment of $286,000 for surplus land. The crowd pressed for the price per acre, and Sayre finally conceded they were offering the Wichita only 50 cents per acre. When it became evident that the Wichita would not negotiate without an attorney, the government produced Luther H. Pike to represent them.who had persuaded &lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 126–128&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Pike and the Wichita agreed to the Commission's terms, with the exception of the price per acre. Jerome agreed to allow Congress to set the price.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1891 at [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]], the [[Agreement with the Wichita and Affiliated Bands (1891)]] ceded their surplus land, with Congress setting the price per acre. Allotments were {{convert|160|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}}, and limited to a total 1,060 allotments. Each allotments in excess of that amount was to reduce the total amount Congress approved for payment of the surplus land. The allotments were to be selected by the individual tribal members within 90 days of Congressional ratification of the agreement. If any member failed to make the selection within that time frame, the selection would be made for them by the local agent. Land patents to the individual land allotted were to be held in a tax-free trust for the benefit of the allottees, for a period of twenty-five years. Interpreters Cora West and Robert M. Dunlap attested to having fully interpreted the terms of the agreement to the tribes before signing began. Congress ratified the agreement March 2, 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 340–342&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, the Court of Claims rendered a judgment, that only the Choctaw and Chicksaw were entitled to the payment for the surplus land. The Wichita appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], which overturned the ruling. The Court of Claims awarded the Wichitas $673.371.91 ($1.25 an acre) for their surplus land. When Congress finally appropriated the funding in 1902, it deducted 43,332.93 from the total payment for attorney fees.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kickapoo – September 9, 1891===
The nomadic [[Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma|Kickapoo]] were first known to inhabit [[Michigan]], and by the 19th Century were split between Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. The Texas band migrated to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nunley|first=M. Christopher|title=Kickapoo|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmk09|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, Colonel [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]], under orders from General [[Philip H. Sheridan]], raided the Kickapoo camps in Mexico. The captured Kickapoo were forcibly removed to Indian Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latorre|first=Dolores L. and Felipe A|title=Mexican Kickapoo Indians|year=1991|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-26742-5|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 1890 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,''  submitted by Indian Agent Col. S.L. Patrick, the total Kickapoo reservation population was counted at 325.&lt;ref name="Iowa199"/&gt; Reservation acreage was reported as approximately{{convert|200000|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}}, west of the Sac and Fox reservation. It was reported that $5,000 was appropriated annually for basic medical care, supplies and farming implements. The population was reported as good farmers.&lt;ref name="Iowa200"/&gt;

The Kickapoo were first approached by the Commission, with Lucius Fairchild as Chairman,  in October 1889. The tribe was not interested in allotments.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 1890, the Commission under Jerome returned to negotiate with the Kickpoo. The tribe had since been under advisement by Cherokee Chief Joel B. Mayes, and once again rebuffed the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1891, the Commission returned to negotiate with the tribe. The Kickapoo refused to anger the Great Spirit by ceding their land.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 134–136&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome moved the negotiations to [[Washington, D.C.]]. Okanokasie, Keshokame and five headmen were authorized to represent the tribe. A white man named John T. Hill acted as tribal advisor.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 1891 in Washington, D.C., the Kickapoo signed the [[Agreement with the Kickapoo (1891)]] to cede their lands for $64,650 (about 32 cents per acre). Their allotments were {{convert|80|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} per person. and not to exceed a total of 300 allotments.  Each allotment over the 300 limit would result in $50 being deducted from the $64,650 paid to the tribe. The allotments were to be selected by the individual tribal members within 90 days of Congressional ratification of the agreement. If any member failed to make the selection within that time frame, the selection would be made for them by the local agent. Land patents to the individual allotments land were to be held in a tax-free trust for the benefit of the allottees, for a period of twenty-five years. Joseph Whipple, testified that he was chosen by the Kickapoo as interpreter because of his fluency with the tribal language. He also attested that he was neither able to read nor write, and that what he conveyed to the Kickapoo was a translation of what had been read to him by Sayre. Congress ratified the agreement March 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 343–346&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quaker]] field matron Elizabeth Test reported in August 1894, that most Kickapoo did not understand that the agreement meant they were giving up their land.  With the assistance of advocate [[Charles C. Painter]] of the [[Indian Rights Association]], the Kickapoo presented their case to the House Committee on Indian Affairs  Painter alleged the Commission had used, "trickery, coercion, threats and cunning," and had also, "over-reached and defrauded" the Kickapoo. In 1908, Congress appropriated another $215,000 for the tribe, but deducted $26, 875 for payment of the services of a Martin J. Bentley.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tonkawa – October 21, 1891===
Originally a Texas tribe, the [[Tonkawa Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma|Tonkawa]] came close to extinction with the dwindling herds of buffalo. In 1859, the United States government moved them to the Leased District in Indian Territory. During the Civil War, the tribe aligned with the Confederacy. In 1862, the [[Tonkawa Massacre]] decimated the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stott|first=Kelly McMichael|title=Waxahachie: Where Cotton Reigned King|year=2002|publisher=Arcadia Publishing SC|isbn=978-0-7385-2389-7|pages=12, 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, the Tonkawa relocated to the Outlet in the area currently known as [[Kay County, Oklahoma|Kay County]] and served as scouts for the United States Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlisle|first=Jeffrey D|title=Tonkawa Indians|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bmt68|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land had been conveyed by the Cherokee Nation in 1883 to the United States, to be held in trust for the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]], and later abandoned by the Nez Perce when they returned to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=May|first=Jon D|title=Tonkawa|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/T/TO003.html|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 1890 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,''  submitted by Indian Agent D.J.M. Wood, the total Tonkawa reservation population was counted at 76. Of this number, 14 were school children. They were described as a group who dressed in the white society's attire and attempted to speak only English. Many in the populace were identified as retired Government scouts and their wives. The agent stipulated these people should be cared for, in recognition of their government service. The only problem reported was alcohol and mescal bean addiction. The report called the Tonkawa "ready and anxious" to accept allotments.&lt;ref name="Tonkawa194"&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1890) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 1891 at the Ponca Indian Agency, the Tonkawa signed the [[Agreement with the Tonkawa (1891)]] to cede  their entire {{convert|90710.89|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} to the United States government, in return for $30, 600 (approximately 34 cents an acre). $25 was to be paid in cash to each person within sixty days of ratification by Congress. An additional $50 was to be paid to each tribal member within six months of ratification.The remainder of the money was to be held in trust at the United States Treasury at 5% per annum, payable annually. Sixty-nine allotments of land were agreed to, plus a like allotment for any future tribal member born after the agreement was signed, but alive by the date of Congressional ratification. Land patents to the individual land allotted were to be held in a tax-free trust for the benefit of the allottees, for a period of twenty-five years. Peter Dupee, adopted member of the Tonkawa tribe, acted as interpreter. Congress ratified the agreement on February 3, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 346–348&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tonkawa hired legal counsel and claimed they had been pressured into signing the agreement, under the threat that all their allotments would be canceled if they failed to capitulate. They claimed they had demanded $1.25 per acre. Congress failed to act on their claim.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cherokee – December 1891===
During the 1836–1839  [[Cherokee removal]] from all tribal lands west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], the tribe signed the 1835 [[Treaty of New Echota]] that created their reservation in Oklahoma, "including the Outlet" specifically named as part of the Cherokee reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty of New Echota|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0439.htm#mn11|work=Kapper's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acreage west of the 96th [[Meridian (geography)|Meridian]] was known as the [[Cherokee Outlet]], or Cherokee Strip. When cattlemen began leasing grazing land on the Outlet, the Cherokees levied taxes on the cattlemen. Some of the cattlemen ignored the levies, and began building fences made of Outlet timber. In 1883, the Interior Department forced removal of the fences. The cattlemen formed the Cherokee Strip Livestock Association to work with the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United States Soil Service|title=Soil Survey|year=1938|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chiefjoelbmayes.png|thumb|150px|left|Cherokee Chief Joel B. Mayes]]
Tribal chief [[Joel B. Mayes]] was a graduate of [[Cherokee Male Seminary]], a former school teacher, and a veteran of the Confederate First Indian Regiment during the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]]. Before and after the war, Mayes ran a farm, oversaw his fruit orchards, and raised livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Five Civilized Tribes in Indian Territory: The Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole Nations|year=1894|publisher=United States Census Office|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, he was elevated to Chief Justice of the Cherokee Supreme Court, and became Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation in 1888. Mayes was responsible for renegotiation of the grazing lease on the Outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conley|first=Robert J|title=A Cherokee Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=University of New Mexico|isbn=978-0-8263-3951-5|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected as Chief in 1891, and died on December 14 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 148, 157&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death, Colonel Johnson Harris  was elected chief.&lt;ref name="JHarris"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Will|title=The Papers of Will Rogers: Wild West and Vaudeville, April 1904 – September 1908|year=1996|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2745-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Commission's organizational meeting on July 1, 1889, Interior Secretary Noble directed the Commission to begin negotiations with the Cherokees for cession of the Outlet.&lt;ref name="H20"/&gt; The majority of Cherokees did not want to sell the Outlet land, and Chief Mayes was focused on potential increase in tribal income by hiking taxes to cattlemen.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius Fairchild and the Commission first arrived in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] on July 29, and made an offer for the Outlet on August 2.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp.  24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Commission efforts did not bear fruition, and the Cherokees were notified on December 27, 1889, that the Commission's offer was to be withdrawn.&lt;ref name="H37"/&gt; At the urging of Noble and Fairchild, President Harrison issued a proclamation on February 17, 1890 banning all cattle and livestock from the Outlet, and ordering removal of any existing cattle and livestock no later than October 1, 1890, eliminating Cherokee income from the Outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitchett|first=Allen D|title=Early History of Noble County|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v017/v017p075.html|work=Chronicles of Oklahoma|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louis F. Burns|first=Louis F. Burns|title=A History of the Osage People|year=2004|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-5018-5|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1890, with Jerome as Chairman, the Commission returned to resume negotiations. Empowered by the Cherokee National Council, Mayes appointed a nine-member committee: Stan W. Gray as Chairman, [[William P. Ross]], Johnson Spade, Rabbit Bunch, L.B. Bell, Stephen Tehee, John Wickliffe, Arch Scrapper and George Downing. E. C. Boudinot acted as clerk, and Captain H. Benge acted as interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; By December 26, 1890, the negotiations once again aborted with no results.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 96–98&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States House Committee on Territories]] recommended in February 1891 bypassing negotiations and annexing the Outlet, paying the Cherokees $1.25 an acre as a settlement. In the Oklahoma Territory, judges ruled that the Cherokees had no legal ownership of the Outlet. Cherokee delegates submitted documentation as proof of Outlet ownership. The Commission re-opened negotiations with the Cherokees in November 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 144–149&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission presented its basic proposal to the tribe. The Cherokees requested the boundary of the Outlet be moved from the 96th to the 100th Meridian, and that the government estimate the acreage involved in the negotiations.  A main point of contention in the negotiations was the question of intruders, outside workers residing on Cherokee land, and the history of the United States failing to handle the problem. The Cherokee Nation presented a counter-proposal that called for $3 an acre. Both Jerome and Sayre ridiculed the Cherokee proposal. The Commission threatened that Congress could remove the tribe from Trade and Intercourse acts.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 150–154&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, the Commission and the tribe came close to terms, with the Cherokees asking for $2 an acre. E. C. Boudinot continued to debate with the Commission over details, and said the tribe had a copy of the 1889 Indian Office's instructions to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, a compromise was reached.&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 348–351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agreement with the Cherokee (1891)]] was ratified by the Cherokee National Council at [[Talequah, Oklahoma|Talequah]] on January 4, 1892. The Cherokees ceded {{convert|8144682.91|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}}, for $8,595,736.12.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Congress ratified the agreement on March 4, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the Indian Claims Commission awarded the Cherokee Nation $14,364,476.15 compensation for underpayment by the government. The commission ruled that the land had actually been worth $3.75 an acre in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comanche, Kiowa and Apache – October 6–21, 1892===
On October 21, 1867, the [[Kiowa people|Kiowa]] and [[Comanche]] tribes signed the Treaty of Medicine Lodge, which removed them to a shared reservation in Indian Territory, and also stipulated that any land cession required the signature of three-fourths of all the adult males of the reservation population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty-Kiowa, Comanche |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/kio0977.htm |work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties |publisher=Oklahoma State University Library |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126182821/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/kio0977.htm |archivedate=26 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne (2010) pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt; Not all tribal members immediately went to the reservation. Many continued to live on the plains, only brought to conformity by the [[Red River War]] campaign. [[Quanah Parker]] and his Quahada Comanche band surrendered near Fort Sill on June 2, 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne (2010) p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Parker was responsible for bringing a renegade band of Comanches to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne (2010) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Once on the reservation, Parker became wealthy through cattle leasing. He was paid $35 a month by cattlemen as their spokesperson, and sent to Washington D.C. to represent them.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne (2010) p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; The cattlemen also helped finance the building of Parker's eight-bedroom two-story reservation [[Quanah Parker Star House|Star House]].&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne (2010) p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chief Quanah Parker of the Kwahadi Comanche.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Quanah Parker]]
In the August 1892 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,''  submitted by Indian Agent George D. Day, the total reservation population was counted as Kiowa 1,014, Comanche 1,531 and Apache 241.&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1892) p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission opened negotiations with the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache at [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma|Fort Sill]] on September 26, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome made an opening presentation, and Quanah Parker asked specifically how much money per acre, and what were the terms offered. Jerome stalled on the details of money. Other tribal members preferred to defer the negotiations until the [[Treaty of Medicine Lodge]] expired.  At the next day's session, Parker continued to press Jerome for financial details, as Jerome avoided discussing the money. Sayre detailed the overall offer of $2,000,000 and per capita distribution. Parker once again asked how much per acre.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne (2010) pp. 308–309&lt;/ref&gt; Sayre didn't have an answer, and Parker asked him how he arrived at $2,000,000. To that, Sayre replied, "...we just guess at it." Parker stated that he had heard about price per acre differential between the various tribal agreements. [[Lone Wolf the Younger|Lone Wolf]] added that many wanted to defer until the expiration of the Medicine Lodge treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, Wilson cited the 1887 Dawes Act, reminding the tribes that the government could force allotment on them. Parker proposed one elected representative from each tribe meet with an attorney of his choosing, with two months to prepare a tribal proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;  Indian agent George D. Day spoke on October 5, telling the assemblage that the commissioners were their friends, and they could either accept the Commission's offer, or be forced into allotment by the Dawes Act.  Jerome pointed to Parker's wealth erroneously as an example of what allotment would bring to the average tribal member.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Parker had proposed that $500,000 be added to the $2,000,000 offer, and that Congress make the decision about it. Kiowa chief Tohauson spoke on October 6, saying that neither he nor many in his tribe would sign the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; At the final Fort Sill meeting on October 11, the Commission pressed for signatures from reluctant Kiowas.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]] was the location for the October 14, 15, 17 sessions, which were noted for the Kiowa reluctance to sign the document.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 198–202&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22 on [[Fort Sill]], the Commission notified the President they had the required number of signatures for the [[s:Agreement with the Comanche, Kiowa and Apache, 1892|Agreement with the Comanche, Kiowa and Apache (1892)]].&lt;ref name="Hagan 2003 p. 203"&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 355–358&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests began immediately that there had been irregularity in obtaining signatures, and that individuals had been misled about the terms of the agreement.&lt;ref name="Hagan 2003 p. 203"/&gt; Lone Wolf and Quanah Parker joined others many times in Washington D.C. meetings to air their viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne (2010) p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; From 1893 each succeeding Congress attempted to amend the agreement before its final ratification in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Commission laid claim to a sufficient number of signatures for passage, [[Lone Wolf the Younger|Lone Wolf]]  and other Kiowa alleged fraud. In October 1899, a petition of a majority of Kiowa males was presented to Congress questioning the validity of the agreement. Upon the onset of the allotment process, Lone Wolf filed a complaint with the Supreme Court in the District of Columbia, seeking an injunction against the Department of Interior. Former Congressman William Springer acted as the tribal attorney. The Indian Rights Association also became involved. The complaint alleged that the agreement was unconstitutional on the grounds that it conflicted with the Treaty of Medicine Lodge requirement of signatures of three-fourths of all tribal adult males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=John W|title=Historic US Court Cases|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93756-6|pages=689–702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1903 [[s:Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock|Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock]] decision, the Court ruled against Lone Wolf, stating that the Congress acted in good faith, and the judiciary branch of government should not question its motives. The Court ruled that Congress was within its plenary powers to abrogate treaties when it acts in the best interests of the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, Pritzker (2007) pp. 569–572&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pawnee – November 23, 1892===
The Pawnee had four bands:Chaui (Grand Pawnee), Kitkahahki (Republican Pawnee), Pitahawirata (Tapage Pawnee) and Skidi (Loups).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jensen|first=Richard E|title=The Pawnee Mission Letters, 1834–1851|year=2010|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-2987-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1876, the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] ceded their reservation in [[Nebraska]], sold by the United States government through a public sale. Proceeds of the sale of the Nebraska reservation were used to relocate the tribe to Indian Territory, on land purchased from the Cherokee. Surplus funds remaining after the purchase and relocation were to be credited to the Pawnee at the United States Treasury. The Pawnee owned {{convert|230014|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} in the Outlet, and {{convert|53006|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} south of there.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1876 Pawee relocation from Nebraska to Oklahoma|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/HTML_files/SES0159.html#ch51e|work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 1892 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,'' submitted by Indian Agent D.J.M. Wood, the total Pawnee reservation population was counted at 798, of which 382 were male and 416 were female. Of the total population, 400 were considered of mixed blood. The number under the age of 24 who were considered literate was reported at 160. And 225 of the Pawnee were reported as being able to use the English language. Of {{convert|283020|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}}, {{convert|1986|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} were under cultivation. The report contains a section on the Pawnee participation in the [[Ghost Dance]], which promised to bring a new messiah to force intruders off their land, and return the buffalo. The named prophet on the reservation was Frank White, whom the agent had arrested. The agent refers to having avoided a [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] disaster.&lt;ref name="CAPawnee"&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1892) p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ghost Dance religion took root among the Pawnee in 1891, after Frank White became a convert while participating in it with the Comanches and the Wichitas. By the date mentioned in the agent's report, two-thirds of the Pawnee had become participants. Many within the tribe had given up reservation labors in favor of serving the new messiah with the dancing. When the government objected, the Pawnee practiced their religion covertly. White's arrest was a government attempt to quash the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kerstetter|first=Todd M|title=God's Country, Uncle Sam's Land: Faith and Conflict in the American West|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03038-3|pages=119, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H217"/&gt;

In attendance at the first October 31, 1892 Commission session were Jerome, Wilson and [[Helen P. Clarke]], of the [[Piegan Blackfeet|Piegan]] tribe, to facilitate the allotments. Harry Coons acted as monitor on behalf of the Pawnee. Jerome began the sessions by referring to the dictates of the Dawes Act. Jerome told the Pawnee they had no option but to capitulate, and that leasing to cattlemen was forbidden. The Pawnee were concerned about being deprived of their livelihood, and about future generations of Pawnee not being beneficiaries of the agreement. Jerome threatened them with cutting off food rations, and told them their only protection from white intruders on their land was to cede the land to the government.&lt;ref name="H211"&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 209–211&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2,  Jerome presented the terms of the government's offer. Sticking points were the $1.25 per acre being proposed, and the stipulation that of the {{convert|160|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} person, only {{convert|80|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} could be used for agriculture.&lt;ref name="H211"/&gt; The Pawnee wanted the {{convert|160|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} with no restrictions, and $2.50 per acre for ceded land. Sun Chief had heard that Quanah Parker had negotiated $1.50 per acre, but Jerome said the Comanches only received 80 cents per acre. After five days, on November 9 and 10, the Pawnee decided to lower their price to $1.50 an acre. Jerome refused. Sun Chief offered to split the difference between the government's offer and the Pawnee demand. Jerome refused. When the tribal representatives expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of government clothing allotments, Warren Sayre offered to give the tribe half of the clothing allowance in cash. Brave Chief wanted assurances that the government would support the tribe's right to conduct the Ghost Dances. Sayre confirmed it vocally but refused to put it in writing.&lt;ref name="H217"&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 212–217&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun Chief announced that he had given his approval for the Commission agreement. On November 23,  [[Agreement with the Pawnee (1892)]] was voted upon and signed. From the {{convert|283020|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} that made up the Pawnee reservation, {{convert|111932|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} were converted to individual allotments. {{convert|171088|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} ceded as surplus ($1.25 per acre). $80,000 was to be paid in cash upon Congressional ratification of the agreement. The remainder would be held in the United States Treasury at 5% per annum, with annual per capita distributions. The allotments were to be selected by the individual tribal members within four months of Congressional ratification of the agreement. If any member failed to make the selection within that time frame, the selection would be made for them by the local agent. Land patents to the individual land allotted were to be held in a tax-free trust for the benefit of the allottees, for a period of twenty-five years.Pawnee Ralph C. Weeks served as interpreter.Congress ratified the document on March 3, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deloria, DeMaille (1999) pp. 361–363&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the Indian Claims Commission ruled the Pawnee had been underpaid for sale of its Nebraska reservation, and awarded the tribe more than $7,000.000.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure to negotiate treaties==

===Osage, Kaw and Otoe===
In the August 1892 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,'' the [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and  [[Kaw (tribe)|Kaw]] report was submitted by Indian Agent L.J. Miles. The population on the Osage the reservation numbered 1,644. The Osage were described as being a religious people who were honest and having pride in their heritage. The Kaw on the reservation were counted at 209. The Kaw populace was described as a generous people who gave away their own possessions to others.&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1892) pp. 390–391&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22, 1893, the Commission attempted negotiation with the Osage, and the Kaw. Neither tribe was interested in negotiating. Section 8 of the Dawes act excluded the Osage, so they could not be compelled to accept allotments. The Osage had their own government with a written constitution. The Kaw refused to entertain the idea of allotments unless the Commission was able to secure an agreement with the Ponca.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1892 Indian Affairs report, the [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]] report was submitted by Indian Agent D.J.M. Wood, and the population was counted as 362, living on {{convert|129113|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}}. Helen P. Clark had already made allotments to many Otoe. The Ghost Dance, which the agent refers to as "The Messiah Craze", was quashed by arresting one participant named Buffalo Black .&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1892) pp. 398–399&lt;/ref&gt; The Otoe refused to meet with the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ponca===
[[File:White Eagle Ponca chief by John K Hillers.jpg|thumb|150px|left|White Eagle, Ponca chief]]
[[Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma|Ponca]] [[Dakota Territory]] land was given to the [[Sioux]] in the [[Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868]]. In 1877, the Ponca were forcibly removed to Indian Territory. President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] denied the appeal to stop the removal, filed by Chiefs [[Standing Bear]], Standing Buffalo, White Eagle and Big Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Charles M|title=General Crook and the Western Frontier|year=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3358-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma|Ponca]] lived on {{convert|101894|acre|km2 sqmi|lk=on}} in the Outlet, purchased for $50,000 in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1878 Ponca Land Purchase-OK|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/Images/v1p0191.jpg|work=Kappler's Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties|publisher=Oklahoma State University Library|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the August 1892 ''Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior,''  submitted by Indian Agent D.J.M. Wood, the total Ponca reservation population was counted at 567. Two hundred of the Ponca were reported as being able to use the English language.Total tribal earnings during the previous year were reported as $325.71.&lt;ref name="CA1891"&gt;Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1892) p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

During October 1891 and spring 1892, the Commission met with the Ponca. The commissioners read the Dawes Act. White Eagle suggested the white homesteaders "..stay on their own reservation." The Ponca felt there was no evidence that allotments, or lack thereof, made any difference in a tribe's standard of living. On April 12, Sayre presented the government's proposal. The Commission threatened that Congress could cut off Ponca annual appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 169–180&lt;/ref&gt;  A Ponca delegation visited the Cherokee Nation for advice, but the Cherokee were unable to help.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1893, negotiations resumed, during which Jerome threatened that the government can do anything it wants. On April 10, Jerome told the Ponca that they would stay until the Ponca agreed to allotments. Sayre threatened with possible cancellation of grass lease money. The Ponca held firm that they owned the land, and reminded the Commission of what happened to the Ponca's land in Dakota Territory. Jerome responded that the government would force the allotment on the Ponca, and threatened one attendee with jail.  The Commission threatened to cut off all government services unless the Ponca capitulated. The Commission gave up on June 6, 1893, twenty months after they began.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan (2003) pp. 223–230&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Children's Regional Planning Committees''' were established in [[England and Wales]] by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Security]] in 1970 under Section 35 of the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1969]]. They comprised one elected representative from each [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] and [[county borough]] council in the area which they covered and were funded by those same councils. There were eleven committees throughout [[England]] (North, Yorkshire and Humberside, North Western, West Midlands, East Midlands, East Anglia, Home Counties, London Boroughs, South East, Wessex, and South West) and one for [[Wales]].

The task of these committees was to prepare development plans for a system of community [[children's home]]s in their area and to prepare schemes of "intermediate treatment" (i.e. an intermediate step to be taken before removing a child who was in trouble or at risk into care).

'''The Copyright and Related Rights Regulations 2003''' transpose [[Copyright Directive|Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society]],{{ref|2001-29}}
often known as the ''EU copyright directive'', into [[United Kingdom]] law. As such, its main effects are to modify the
[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] c.&amp;nbsp;48 ("the 1988 Act") with minor consequential modifications to other
[[Act of Parliament|Acts]] and [[statutory Instrument|secondary legislation]].

The regulations modify the concept of broadcast and broadcasting to take account of development in the [[internet]]; restrict
the acts which are permitted without infringing copyright (in particular acts which could be performed commercially); and
provide new measures for the protection and enforcement of copyright and performers' rights.

Only two EU Member States met the 22 December 2002 deadline for implement, the UK implemented the directive in 2003 but in November 2004 was convicted for non-implementation of the directive in the territory of [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Implementation of the directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the Information Society |publisher=Association of European Performers’ Organisations |url=http://www.aepo-artis.org/pages/59_1.html |accessdate=9 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broadcasts ==
Regulation&amp;nbsp;4 provides a new definition of "broadcast" in section&amp;nbsp;6 of the 1988 Act as
: ''an electronic transmission of visual images, sounds or other information which—''
:: ''(a) is transmitted for simultaneous reception by members of the public and is capable of being lawfully received by them, or''
:: ''(b) is transmitted at a time determined solely by the person making the transmission for presentation to members of the public,''
Internet transmissions are excepted from the definition of a broadcast unless they are transmitted simultaneously with a broadcast by other means, simultaneously with a live event or form part of a service in which programmes are transmitted at specific times determined solely by the person providing the service.

The new definition covers the old definitions of broadcast and of "cable programme" (s.&amp;nbsp;7 of the 1988 Act). However the
separate definition of cable programme is kept as there is a distinction in the dates at which copyright becomes available:
1995-01-01 for cable programmes as opposed to 1956-06-01 for broadcasts under the previous definition.

== Communication to the public ==
The previous "infringement by broadcasting or inclusion in a cable programme" (s.&amp;nbsp;20 of the 1988 Act) is replaced by a
new "infringement by communication to the public" (reg.&amp;nbsp;6). This includes both broadcasting (under the new definition)
and making a work available to the public by electronic transmission. A performer's rights are also infringed if his
performance is made available to the public without his consent (reg;&amp;nbsp;7; new s.&amp;nbsp;182CA of the 1988 Act).

== Permitted acts and copyright exceptions ==
Neither copyright (except in a computer program or a database) nor performer's rights are infringed by the
simple act of transmitting the work between third parties over a network, even if the process of transmission involves
making temporary copies (reg.&amp;nbsp;8)

The existing [[fair dealing]] for the purposes of research or private study (s.&amp;nbsp;29 of the 1988 Act) was limited so that it is only permitted for a non-commercial purpose (reg.&amp;nbsp;9).{{ref|PrivStud}} A similar restriction was imposed on permitted copying by librarians (ss.&amp;nbsp;38, 39, 43 of the 1988 Act; reg.&amp;nbsp;14) or archivists of folksongs (s.&amp;nbsp;61 of the 1988 Act; reg.&amp;nbsp;16) for third parties. The observation or study of the functioning of a computer program was removed from the remit of fair dealing (reg.&amp;nbsp;9) and replaced by a statutory permission to study the functioning of the program while legally performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program (reg.&amp;nbsp;15; new s.&amp;nbsp;50BA of the 1988 Act). It was clarified that fair dealing for the purposes of criticism, review or news reporting is only allowed for published works (reg.&amp;nbsp;10).

The permitted use without a licence of copyright material for educational use (ss.&amp;nbsp;32, 35, 36 of the 1988 Act) was restricted to non-commercial purposes (regs.&amp;nbsp;11–13). Regulation&amp;nbsp;18 removes the permission to use third parties (e.g. outside DJs) to play sound recordings for the purposes of a non-commercial club or society (s.&amp;nbsp;67 of the 1988 Act). The exception for public showing or playing of broadcasts of music (s.&amp;nbsp;72 of the 1988 Act) was also permitted, and the Secretary of State was enabled to propose a licensing scheme covering such public showing or playing, which may be compulsory (reg.&amp;nbsp;21).

== Technical measures ==
New s.&amp;nbsp;296 of the 1988 Act created new rights in respect of copyright works to which [[copy protection]] measures have been applied. This right is held concurrently by:
* any person issuing copies of the work to the public or communicating the work to the public; and
* the owner of the copyright in the work, or his exclusive licensee; and
* the owner of any intellectual property right in the technical device or measure, or his exclusive licensee.
* who have the same rights against an infringement of this right as the owner of copyright has against infringement of copyright, including [[seizure]].

The right is infringed:
* with respect to protected computer programs, by a person who "manufactures for sale or hire, imports, distributes, sells or lets for hire, offers or exposes for sale or hire, advertises for sale or hire or has in his possession for commercial purposes" any means "the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of the technical device" or who publishes information intended to enable or assist other in removing or circumventing the technical device (new s.&amp;nbsp;296 of the 1988 Act);
* with respect to other protected works, by a person who knowingly circumvents the technical measures (new s.&amp;nbsp;296ZA of the 1988 Act);
*by a person who manufactures, imports, distributes, sells or advertises any device or product which, or provides services which:
** are promoted or marketed for the purpose of circumventing such measures; or
** have only limited commercial significance beyond circumventing such measures; or
** are primarily designed, produced, adapted or performed for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of such measures (new s.&amp;nbsp;296ZD of the 1988 Act).

The new section&amp;nbsp;296ZB established the criminal offenses of:
* manufacturing for sale or hire, importation, sale or distribution of devices or products which are primarily designed or adapted for the purpose of the circumvention of technological measures;
* providing, promoting, advertising or marketing a service the purpose of which is to enable or facilitate the circumvention of technical measures.

The new section&amp;nbsp;296ZC allows the use of [[search warrant]]s and [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] with respect to these offenses. The new section&amp;nbsp;296ZE created a remedy via complaint to the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] if a technical device or measure prevents a person or group of people from carrying out a permitted act with relation to the work. The Secretary of State may issue a direction to the owner of the copyright to take such measures as are necessary to enable the permitted act to be carried out. The breach of such a direction is actionable as a [[breach of statutory duty]].

== Rights management information ==
New s.&amp;nbsp;296ZG of the 1988 Act created new rights in respect of electronic rights management information [[metadata]]. The right is infringed by:
* the person who knowingly removes electronic copyright management information which is associated with a copy of a copyright work, or appears in connection with the communication to the public of a copyright work;
* the person who knowingly distributes or communicates to the public copies of a work from which electronic rights management information has been removed.

== Enforcement of copyright and performer's rights ==
The infringement of copyright or performer's rights by making a work available to the public in the course of a business or to an extent which prejudicially affects the copyright owner becomes a criminal offense (reg.&amp;nbsp;26; new s.&amp;nbsp;107(2A) of the 1988 Act).

A copyright holder may obtain an [[injunction]] ([[Scots law]]: interdict) against an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) who has "actual knowledge" of another person using their service to infringe copyright or a performer's right. In determining whether the ISP has actual knowledge of the infringing use, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] (or [[Court of Session]] in Scotland) shall take into account all matters which appear to be relevant, in particular whether the ISP has received notification under regulation&amp;nbsp;6(1)(c) of the [[Electronic Commerce Regulations 2002|Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002]] No.&amp;nbsp;2013{{ref|SI2002-2013}} (reg.&amp;nbsp;27; new ss.&amp;nbsp;97A, 191JA of the 1988 Act).

Regulation&amp;nbsp;28 extended the right to bring action for infringement of copyright to non-exclusive licensees (it was previously limited to copyright owners and exclusive licensees) when the infringement is directly connected to a prior licensed act by the licensee and the licence expressly grants a right of action (new s.&amp;nbsp;101A of the 1998 Act).
The non-exclusive licensee shall have the same rights and remedies as the copyright owner would have in any action.
The right of the non-exclusive licensee to bring action is concomitant with that of the copyright owner.

== Duration of protection ==
Regulation&amp;nbsp;29 amends section&amp;nbsp;13A of the 1988 Act to take account of the new definition of "communication to the public" so that the copyright in sound recordings expires:
* at the end of the period of fifty years from the end of the calendar year in which the recording is made, or
* if during that period the recording is published, fifty years from the end of the calendar year in which it is first published, or
* if during that period the recording is not published but is made available to the public by being played in public or communicated to the public, fifty years from the end of the calendar year in which it is first so made available.

[[File:Dogo1.jpg|thumb|A [[Guatemalan Dogo]] with cropped ears]]
[[File:Pit bull with cropped ears.jpg|thumb|'''[[Pit bull]]''' with cropped ears]]
'''Cropping''' is the removal of part or all of the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]] or auricles, the external visible flap of the ear, of an animal; it sometimes involves taping to make the ears pointy.  Most commonly performed on dogs, it is an ancient practice that was once done for perceived health, practical or cosmetic reasons. In modern times, it is banned in many nations, but is still legal in a limited number of countries. Where permitted, it is seen only in certain breeds of dog such as the [[Pit bull]], [[Miniature Pinscher]], [[German Pinscher]], [[Doberman Pinscher]], [[Schnauzer]], [[Great Dane]], [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]], [[Caucasian Shepherd Dog]] and [[Beauceron]].

The veterinary procedure is known as cosmetic otoplasty. Current veterinary science provides no medical or physical advantage to the animal from the procedure,&lt;ref name=slatter&gt;Slatter, Douglas H. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=B_nh6zSr4wUC ''Textbook of small animal surgery''] 3rd edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders (imprint of Elsevier Health Sciences), 2896 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-7216-8607-3}}, p.1746&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=petmd&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Pet MD|url=http://www.petmd.com/dog/care/evr_dg_ear_cropping_is_it_right_for_your_dog|title=Ear Cropping: Is it right for your dog?}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to concerns over [[animal cruelty]] related to performing unnecessary surgery on the animals. In addition to the bans in place in countries around the world, it is described in some veterinary texts as "no longer considered ethical."&lt;ref name=slatter/&gt;

Cropping of large portions of the pinnae of other animals is rare, although the clipping of identifying shapes in the pinnae of [[livestock]], called [[Earmark (agriculture)|earmark]]s, was common prior to the introduction of compulsory [[ear tag]]s.&lt;ref name=manade&gt;[http://www.manade-en-camargue.fr/manade-en-camargue-lexique.html Lexique Camarguais] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015001430/http://www.manade-en-camargue.fr/manade-en-camargue-lexique.html# |date=2011-10-15 }} (in French) Manade Devaux. "Lexicon of Camargue terms" Accessed September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Removal of portions of the ear of [[laboratory mice]] for identification, i.e. ear-notching, is still used.  The practice of cropping for cosmetic purposes is rare in non-canines, although some selectively bred animals have naturally small ears which can be mistaken for cropping.

Ear cropping has been performed on dogs since [[Classical antiquity|ancient]] times.&lt;ref name=Broughton&gt;Broughton, Amy L.

Accessed September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional cropping ===
Historically, cropping was performed on working dogs in order to decrease the risk of health complications, such as ear infections or hematomas. Crops were also performed on dogs that might need to fight, either while hunting animals that might fight back or while defending [[livestock]] herds from predators, or because they were used for pit-fighting sports such as [[dogfighting]] or [[bear-baiting]].&lt;ref name=Briar/&gt;&lt;ref name=murgai&gt;Murgai, Major R.P. (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPPTZvzNNHMC ''Handbook on Dogs''] New Delhi: New Age International, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;  The ears were an easy target for an opposing animal to grab or tear.&lt;ref name=Briar&gt;[http://www.briarleabouvier.com/ear_cropping.htm Ear Cropping: Correct or Cruel?] Briarlea Bouvier Kennel. Accessed September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cropping the ears of [[livestock guardian dogs]] was, and may still be, traditional in some pastoral cultures. The ears of working flock-defense dogs such as the [[Caucasian Shepherd Dog]] (Kavkazskaïa Ovtcharka)&lt;ref name=kavk&gt;Samsonova, Anna [http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/328g02-en.doc Caucasian Shepherd Dog (Kavkazskaïa Ovtcharka)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426221530/http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/328g02-en.doc# |date=2012-04-26 }} Fédération Cynologique Internationale FCI-Standard N° 328, 2 February 2011. Accessed September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Maremma Sheepdog|Pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese]] were traditionally cropped to reduce the possibility of wolves or aggressor dogs getting a hold on them.&lt;ref name=breber&gt;Breber, Paolo (1983) ''Il Cane da Pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese'' (in Italian) 2nd edition. Firenze: Olimpia "The Maremmano-Abruzzese shepherd dog" pp.98–99&lt;/ref&gt; According to one description, cropping was carried out when puppies were weaned, at about six weeks. It was performed by an older or expert shepherd, using the ordinary blade shears used for [[Sheep shearing|shearing]], well sharpened. The ears were cut either to a point like those of a fox, or rounded like those of a bear. The removed auricles were given to the puppy to eat, in the belief that it would make him more "sour";&lt;ref name=breber/&gt; the ears were first grilled.&lt;ref name=anne&gt;MacDonell, Anne, Amy Atkinson (ill.) (1907) [https://archive.org/stream/inabruzzi00macdrich#page/n7/mode/2up ''In the Abruzzi''] New York: F.A. Stokes p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative method was to remove the ears from newborn puppies by twisting them off; however, this left almost no external ear on the dog.&lt;ref name=breber/&gt;  More than three hundred years ago, both ear-cropping and the use of [[Wolf collar|spiked collars]] were described as a defense against wolves by [[Jean de la Fontaine]] in Fable 9 of Book X of the ''Fables'', published in 1678.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;Wright, Elizur (trans.), Jean de la Fontaine (1862) [https://books.google.com/books?id=CDSEvJ41PpMC ''The fables of La Fontaine, translated [in verse&amp;#93; from the French''] London: Miller p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs may have their ears cropped, legally or not, for participation in dogfights, themselves illegal in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=curtis&gt;Curtis, Patricia (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ndd3eAnzpcC ''City dog: choosing and living well with a dog in town''] New York: Lantern Books {{ISBN|978-1-59056-000-6}} p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health benefits ===

Historically, ear cropping has been advocated as a health benefit for certain breeds with long, hanging ears. There is some evidence that dogs with standing ears may suffer from fewer ear infections than dogs with hanging ears.&lt;ref name=Briar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fossum TW. Surgery of the ear. In: Fossum TW, ed. Small Animal Surgery. 3rd ed. St.Louis; Mosby Elsevier, 2007;289-316.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been hypothesized that standing ears are less prone to damage and subsequent medical complications, especially in working dogs. Some claim that cropped ears enhance Boxers' hearing.&lt;ref name=Boxer&gt;{{cite web|author=Abraham, S.|year=1993|url=http://americanboxerclub.org/Gazette/gaz93-01.pdf|publisher=American Kennel Club Gazette, American Boxer Club|accessdate=January 18, 2016|title=Sad lesson learned}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Long, hanging ears can not function the same way as erect ears which can swivel toward a sound source.  The erect shape directs sound waves into the [[ear canal]] and additionally amplifies the sound slightly.  Long, hanging [[Auricle (anatomy)|pinnae]] also impose a physical barrier to sound waves entering the ear canal.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmetic cropping ===
[[File:Boxer (dog).jpg|thumb|[[Boxer (dog)|Boxers]] with natural and cropped ears and docked tails]]
In the last 100 years or so, ear cropping has been performed more often for cosmetic purposes.&lt;ref name=murgai/&gt;&lt;ref name=CFHS/&gt; In nations and states where it remains legal, it is usually practiced because it is required as part of a [[breed standard (dogs)|breed standard]] for exhibition at [[Conformation show|dog shows]].&lt;ref name=CFHS&gt;[http://cfhs.ca/athome/ear_cropping_and_tail_docking Ear cropping and tail docking] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909124714/http://cfhs.ca/athome/ear_cropping_and_tail_docking/# |date=2011-09-09 }} The Canadian Federation of Humane Societies/Fédération des sociétés canadiennes d'assistance aux animaux (CFHS/FSCAA).

The veterinary procedure is known as "cosmetic otoplasty".&lt;ref name="slatter"/&gt; It is usually performed on puppies at 7 to 12 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=doggies&gt;[http://www.doggiesparadise.com/earcropping-dogs.shtml Practice of Dogs Ear cropping] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925085332/http://www.doggiesparadise.com/earcropping-dogs.shtml |date=2011-09-25 }} [sic] Doggie's Paradise. Accessed September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  After 16 weeks, the procedure is more painful and the animal has greater pain memory.&lt;ref name=Briar/&gt; Up to 2/3 of the ear flap may be removed in a cropping operation, and the wound edges are closed with stitches. The ears are then bandaged and taped until they heal into the proper shape.&lt;ref name=doggies/&gt; The procedure is recommended to be undertaken under general anaesthesia; opponents' primary concerns revolve around post-operative pain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Documents/dogs_ear_cropping_bgnd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

American veterinary schools do not generally teach cropping and docking, and thus veterinarians who perform the practice have to learn on the job.&lt;ref name=Broughton/&gt; There are also problems with amateurs performing ear-cropping, particularly at [[puppy mill]]s.&lt;ref name=Broughton/&gt;  

In the USA, although [[docking (dog)|tail-docking]], [[dewclaw|dewclaw removal]], and [[neutering]] procedures remain common, ear-cropping is declining, save within the dog show industry.&lt;ref name=CFHS/&gt; However, many show ring competitors state they would discontinue the practice altogether if they could still "win in the ring."&lt;ref name=USAtoday&gt;Weise, Elizabeth [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-07-30-dog-tails_N.htm 'Banfield pet hospitals ban tail docking, ear cropping on dogs'] ''USA Today'', 30 July 2011. Accessed September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

While it has been suggested the cropping may interfere with a dog's ability to communicate using ear signals, some also argue that cropping increases a dog's ability to communicate with ear signals. There has been no scientific comparative study of ear communication in cropped and uncropped dogs.&lt;ref name=coren&gt;Coren, Stanley (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DeyzQI_a8EsC ''How to speak dog: mastering the art of dog-human communication''] New York: Simon &amp; Schuster {{ISBN|978-0-7432-0297-8}} chap. 9 [pages unnumbered]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naturally small ears==
Some animals, such as the [[American Lamancha goat|Lamancha goat]], have ears which are naturally small as the result of selective breeding, and some people mistakenly believe their ears to be cropped.&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;{{Citation|title=The American Lamancha, and its Ears.|last1=Woods|first1=Dale L.| last2=Hendrickson|first2= Pat |year=1978|publisher=Dairy Goat Journal|url=http://www.lamanchas.com/ears.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goats4h.com/none.html "What did we do to its ears?"Accessed September 19, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other animals, small ears may result from a genetic mutation or the emergence of a [[dominance (genetics)|genetically recessive trait]], such as in [[Highland cattle]], where the appearance of small ears, appearing to have their pinnae cropped, is viewed as a defect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cruachan.com.au/bairnsley.htm Crop Ear. what does it look like?] Cruachan Highland Cattle.

'''Denization''' is an obsolete or defunct process in [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] and the later [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[British Empire]], dating back to the 13th century, by which an [[alien (law)|alien]] (foreigner), through [[letters patent]], became a '''denizen''', thereby obtaining certain rights otherwise only normally enjoyed by the [[British subject|King's (or Queen's) subject]]s, including the right to [[land tenure|hold land]]. The denizen was neither a subject (with [[citizenship]] or [[nationality]]) nor an alien, but had a status akin to [[permanent residency]] today. While one could become a subject via [[naturalisation]], this required a [[private act]] of Parliament (or latterly of a [[Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865|colonial legislature]]); in contrast, denization was cheaper, quicker, and simpler. Denization fell into obsolescence when the [[British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914]] simplified the naturalisation process.

Denization occurred by a grant of letters patent,&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Denizen |volume=8 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exercise of the [[royal prerogative]]. Denizens paid a fee and took an [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oath of allegiance]] to the crown. For example, when Venetian mariner Gabriel Corbet was granted letters of denization in 1431 for service upon the seas to [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], he was required to pay 40 shillings into the [[hanaper]] for the privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rose, "Corbet, Gabriel (fl. 1427–1454)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of denizen allowed a foreigner to purchase property, although a denizen could not inherit property. [[Sir William Blackstone]] wrote "A denizen is a kind of middle state, between an alien and a natural-born subject, and partakes of both."&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone: Commentaries, Book 1, Chapter X, p374&lt;/ref&gt; The denizen had limited political rights: he could vote, but could not be a member of parliament or hold any civil or military office of trust.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Denizenship has also been compared to the Roman ''[[civitas sine suffragio]]'', although the rights of denizens were restricted by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], not by [[Common law|common]] or [[Time immemorial|immemorial]]  law.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, p.491; the restrictions originally applied to naturalised citizens also.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Denization was expressly preserved by the Naturalisation Act 1870{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and by s25 of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914. (See [[History of British nationality law#Early English and British nationality law|Early British Nationality Law]].) According to the British Home Office, the last denization was granted to the Dutch painter [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] in 1873;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/nationalityinstructions/nisec2gensec/denization?view=Binary|title=Nationality instructions: volume 2 - Publications - GOV.UK|publisher=ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Home Office considered it obsolete when the [[Prince of Pless]] applied for it in 1933, and instructed him to apply for naturalisation instead.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, p.490&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Nationality Act 1948]], a major reform of citizenship law in Britain, made no mention of denization and neither abolished nor preserved the practice.

Denization, as an exercise of royal power, was applicable throughout the British dominion to all British subjects. That is, it was exercisable in the colonies. For example, denization occurred in the colony of [[New South Wales]]. As in Britain, the practice became obsolete to naturalisation, with the last known denization in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/guides-and-finding-aids/short-guide-9/short-guide-9/?searchterm=denization|title=Naturalization / Citizenship Guide|first=|last=Anthea.Brown|date=16 December 2015|publisher=records.nesw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''denizen'' may also refer to any [[Nationality|national]] of a country, whether citizen or non-citizen, with a right to remain in and return to the country. In the United States, before they were made citizens by statute, unassimilated [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s, although born on U.S. soil, were not deemed to be citizens of the United States or any state, but of a [[domestic dependent nation]] contained within the United States but whose members are not even nationals of it, but denizens of it, with a right to remain in and return to their reserved territories.

'''Desert Hot Springs''', also known as '''DHS''', is a city in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], [[California]], United States. The city is located within the [[Coachella Valley]] geographic region, sometimes referred to as the ''Desert Empire''. The population was 25,938 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 16,582 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The city has undergone rapid development and high population growth since the 1970s, when there were 2,700 residents.

It is named for its many natural [[hot spring]]s.&lt;ref name="Howells, John 2015 Page 70"&gt;Howells, John (2015). ''Where to Retire: America’s Best &amp; Most Affordable Places''.

==History==
The only people residing in areas north of [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] prior to the 20th century was [[Cahuilla people|Cahuilla Indians]] in the village of [[Seven Palms, California|Seven Palms]].&lt;ref&gt;Desert Hot Springs Historical Society (2014). ''Desert Hot Springs (Images of America)''. Arcadia Publishing. Page 27. {{ISBN|9781467132176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cahuilla people never settled permanently in today’s Desert Hot Springs,&lt;ref name="Hot Springs Historical Society 2014 Page 11"&gt;Desert Hot Springs Historical Society (2014). ''Desert Hot Springs (Images of America)''. Arcadia Publishing. Page 11. {{ISBN|9781467132176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; they often camped here during winter times due to the warm climate.&lt;ref name="Hot Springs Historical Society 2014 Page 7"/&gt;

According to early homesteader and writer Cabot Yerxa in his newspaper columns published in The Desert Sentinel newspaper, the first [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] in the area of the city of Desert Hot Springs was Hilda Maude Gray, who staked her claim in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;The Life and Times of Pioneer Hilda M Gray, http://hildamgray.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desert Hot Springs Historical Society, http://www.dhshistoricalsociety.com/desert_hot_springs_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Cabot Yerxa arrived in 1913 and soon discovered the hot water aquifer on Miracle Hill. Due to the Mission Creek Branch of the [[San Andreas Fault#Southern|San Andreas Fault]] bisecting the area, one side is a cold water aquifer, the other has a hot water aquifer. His large [[Pueblo Revival Style architecture]] structure, [[Self-build|hand built]] over 20 years, is now one of the oldest adobe-style buildings in [[Riverside County]], and houses [[Cabot's Pueblo Museum]], designated a state historical site after his death in 1965. Cabot's Trading Post &amp; Gallery opened there in February 2008.

The town was founded by L. W. Coffee on July 12, 1941. The original town site was centered at the intersection of Palm Drive and Pierson Boulevard and was only one square mile. Coffee chose the name Desert Hot Springs because of the area's natural [[hot springs]].

[[File:This Natural Hot Mineral Water Pool is maintained at about 95 degrees with a constant flow of approximately 125 gallons a minute (80817).jpg|thumb|upright|1950s postcard promoting tourism]]

Desert Hot Springs became a [[tourist destination]] in the 1950s because of its small [[spa]] [[hotel]]s and [[boutique hotel]]s. The city is popular with "[[snowbird (people)|snowbirds]]."&lt;ref name="Hot Springs Historical Society 2014 Page 8"&gt;Desert Hot Springs Historical Society (2014). ''Desert Hot Springs (Images of America)''. Arcadia Publishing. Page 8. {{ISBN|9781467132176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Realtor]]s arrived to speculate, and thousands of lots and streets were laid out over a six square mile area. Some homes were bought by retirees and the area incorporated as a city in 1963, with 1,000 residents.

Desert Hot Springs experienced periods of significant growth in the 1980s and 1990s, when most of the vacant lots were filled with new houses and duplex apartments. The city's population doubled in the 1980s and increased by 5,000 in the 2000 census.

In 1993, a 3-star hotel, Mirage Springs Hotel Resort opened in DHS. Despite good reviews and providing much needed financial revenue to DHS, Mirage Springs closed its doors in 1998. The business reopened as the Miracle Springs Resort and Spa.

[[Desert Hot Springs High School]] opened in 1999.

Desert Hot Springs was the first city in Southern California to legalize medical marijuana cultivation, and has since been overwhelmed by marijuana developers and growers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-marijuana-cultivation-20160510-story.html|title=This California desert town is experiencing a marijuana boom|first=Paloma|last=Esquivel|date=May 10, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=July 14, 2017|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later featured in a CNBC special as California's first city to permit the commercial cultivation of marijuana in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/television/2017/08/07/desert-hot-springs-featured-cnbc-marijuana-special/547112001/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Desert_Hot_Springs_2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Landscape in western Desert Hot Springs.]]

Before development of the city began in the 1930s, Desert Hot Springs was a treeless place in the Colorado Desert.&lt;ref name="Hot Springs Historical Society 2014 Page 11"/&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|23.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which 99.89% is land and 0.11% is water. Desert Hot Springs is nestled between two mountain ranges: [[San Bernardino Mountains]] and [[San Jacinto Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Hot Springs Historical Society 2014 Page 8"/&gt; It is located just south of [[Big Morongo Canyon Preserve]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. It is located in the [[Colorado Desert]] region of the [[Sonoran Desert]].&lt;ref name="traveltips.usatoday.com"&gt;http://traveltips.usatoday.com/natural-vegetation-desert-hot-springs-california-110230.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Desert Hot Springs has a [[desert]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] BWh) similar to the rest of the Coachella Valley, with less than six inches of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] per year. Summers are very hot with days frequently exceeding {{convert|107|F|C|abbr=on}} in July and August while night-time lows tend to stay between {{convert|78|-|90|F|C|abbr=on}}. The winters are mild with days typically seeing temperatures between {{convert|68|-|82|F|C|abbr=on}} and corresponding night-time lows between {{convert|50|-|65|F|C|abbr=on}}. Heat waves during the summer months involving temperatures higher than {{convert|110|F|abbr=on}} are not unusual.

Summer winds and the higher elevation keep Desert Hot Springs on average 5-7 degrees cooler than other communities in Coachella Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Desert Hot Springs Historical Society (2014). ''Desert Hot Springs (Images of America)''. Arcadia Publishing. Page 22. {{ISBN|9781467132176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the winter season can be warmer due to the surrounding mountains blocking north winds.&lt;ref name="Howells, John 2015 Page 70"/&gt;

The city of Desert Hot Springs contracts for fire and paramedic services with the Riverside County Fire Department through a cooperative agreement with [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|CAL FIRE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rvcfire.org/ourDepartment/ServiceArea/Pages/default.aspx|title=Service Area|website=rvcfire.org|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two separate municipal ballot measures, Desert Hot Springs residents approved a utility users tax and a public safety tax by majorities of over 75 percent. Both measures provide added funding to the police department and other public safety services.

As of November 2013, the continued existence of a city police department is questionable as the city faces looming budget deficits and lack of financial reserves. Instead, the City is considering contracting with the Riverside County Sheriffs Department to manage its police department as a means to increase the number of officers on patrol and as a cost saving measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydesert.com/article/20131114/NEWS01/311140022/DHS-mull-votes-budget-crisis?nclick_check=1|title=The Desert Sun - Palm Springs and Coachella Valley news|website=Desert Sun|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Living_Waters_Spa.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Over 20 natural mineral spring lodgings can be found in town.&lt;ref name="Vokac 2017 Page 3"/&gt;]]
The city is home to windmill farms in the west and also by the [[San Gorgonio Pass]]. Growing use of solar power accompanied with many windmills make Desert Hot Springs a leading city in renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;Desert Hot Springs Historical Society (2014). ''Desert Hot Springs (Images of America)''. Arcadia Publishing. Page 23. {{ISBN|9781467132176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main economy is based on spas. Most of these are owner-operated. The mild climate and hot springs make it a popular tourist destination.&lt;ref name="Hot Springs Historical Society 2014 Page 8"/&gt;

===Municipal bankruptcy===
In 2001 the town filed for a Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-10/brown-signs-bill-to-limit-california-s-municipal-bankruptcies.html "Brown Signs Bill to Limit California's Municipal Bankruptcies", ''Business Week'', October 10, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012191723/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-10/brown-signs-bill-to-limit-california-s-municipal-bankruptcies.html |date=October 12, 2011 }} Accessed October 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The bankruptcy was resolved in 2004&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E3D61530F932A05750C0A9609C8B63 Caldwell, Dave.

===Boutique hotels and spas===
Desert Hot Springs is home to a number of hot [[mineral water]] [[spa]]s. During the 1950s and 1960s the town had over 80 spa hotels, often called "spa-tels." From the late 1990s to the present a number of these [[boutique hotel]]s have been renovated and revived. With their [[mid-century modern]] architecture they appeal to those wanting a unique hotel / spa experience.

One famous spa hotel property in Desert Hot Springs is the [[Two Bunch Palms Resort]]. In 1992 it was used as a filming location for the movie ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|id=18104|title=The Player}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twobunchpalms.com/about/our-history|title=Sustainable Resort in Palm Springs - Mineral Hot Springs - Two Bunch Palms|website=www.twobunchpalms.com|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 [[Huell Howser]] Productions, in association with [[KCET]]/Los Angeles, featured the Desert Hot Springs Hotel and Spa in ''[[California's Gold]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howser|first=Huell|title=Desert Hot Springs Hotel – Palm Springs (0016)|url=http://blogs.chapman.edu/huell-howser-archives/2002/09/25/desert-hot-springs-hotel-palm-springs-0016/|work=California's Gold|publisher=[[Chapman University]] Huell Howser Archives|authorlink=Huell Howser|date=September 25, 2002|oclc= 47724820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernist architecture==
At one time there were 43 small spas (6 to 10 guest rooms) in the city. Some were located atop the hot water aquifer on Miracle Hill, where Cabot Yerxa, one of the early settlers lived. His home is now Cabot's Pueblo Museum. Across the street is Miracle Manor Retreat, one of the first spas built (1949) in the town. It was built by the Martin Family who eventually sold it in 1981 to a local legend, Lois Blackhill. Upon her death in 1996, her family sold it in 1997, to two longtime regulars and close friends of Lois', trans-media designer [[April Greiman]] and architect-educator [[Michael Rotondi]]. It was restored to its original state, with improvements and renamed [[Miracle Manor Retreat]]. They are credited with pioneering the 'boutique spa' movement in the city. The Desert Hot Springs Motel, designed by architect [[John Lautner]] is located just outside the city limits. The motel was purchased and restored in 2000 by Steven Lowe.&lt;ref&gt;The John Lautner Foundation, https://web.archive.org/web/20030413175310/http://www.johnlautner.org/Deserthotsprings.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palmspringslife.com/Palm-Springs-Life/February-2012/Deja-New/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019041002/http://www.palmspringslife.com/Palm-Springs-Life/February-2012/Deja-New/ |archivedate=October 19, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the architectural firm of [[Marmol Radziner + Associates]] designed a [[sustainable]], [[modernist]] [[prefabricated building|prefab]] home featured in the November 2006 issue of ''[[Dwell (magazine)|Dwell]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderton|first=Frances|title=Desert Utopia|journal=[[Dwell (magazine)|Dwell]]|date=November 2006|url=http://www.dwell.com/articles/desert-utopia.html|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home served as a [[prototype (disambiguation)|prototype]] for the firm's efforts to develop a series of prefab homes.

==Wildlife==
Desert Hot Springs lies just south of large nature preserves such as [[Big Morongo Canyon Preserve]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]].&lt;ref name="traveltips.usatoday.com"/&gt; Surrounding areas are home to a number of species adapted for the desert climate and temperature extremes. Species include [[Pronghorns]], [[Desert Bighorn Sheep]], [[Desert Tortoise]], [[Kit Fox]], [[Desert Iguana]], [[Horned Lizard]], [[Chuckwalla]], [[Roadrunners]], [[Mountain lion]]s, [[Bird of prey|Raptors]] and [[Gila Monster]]s.

Although [[American black bear|Black bears]] are not common here, a bear was sighted on Palm Drive and Dillon Road in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2017/05/15/bear-sighting-indio-la-verne-rare/323126001/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">'''Environmental audit privilege''', or '''environmental privilege''', in [[United States environmental law]], is an [[evidence (law)|evidentiary]] privilege created under state [[statute]].  The privilege protects the results of companies' internal environmental [[compliance audit]]s from disclosure at trial, or in [[pretrial discovery]].

The environmental audit privilege is meant to incentivize companies to evaluate their own compliance with environmental regulations.&lt;ref name="alec"/&gt;  Proponents of such laws further argue that it is necessary to encourage such self-evaluations, because regulatory agencies lack the resources to police all the [[pollution|polluters]] in their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Battleground: Environment
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0313082405|isbn=0313082405|page=183
|author=Robin Morris Collin|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental audit privilege statutes have been promoted by the conservative [[American Legislative Exchange Council]], which circulates a [[model statute]] known as the "Uniform State Environmental Audit Privilege Act".&lt;ref name="alec"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alec.org/model-policy/uniform-state-environmental-audit-privilege-act/|title=Uniform State Environmental Audit Privilege Act|author=American Legislative Exchange Council|accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, most state environmental privilege laws are non-uniform, and vary greatly in their scope, exceptions and effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental aspects of real estate transactions: from brownfields to green buildings
|author=James B. Witkin
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5089AQAAIAAJ 
|publisher=American Bar Association|year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has been skeptical of state environmental audit privilege laws, and generally requires that states limit the privilege's effect so as not to interfere with federal investigations.&lt;ref name="matters"&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental and Toxic Tort Matters |page= 227
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1M9AQAAIAAJ
|author=American Law Institute-American Bar Association Committee on Continuing Professional Education
|year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns were heightened by the question of whether these laws would apply to state government agencies to which the EPA delegated its enforcement authority under federal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=State Environmental Audit Privilege Laws: Can EPA Still Access Environmental Audits in Federal Court?

|jstor=43267549
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in the past, the EPA has used its statutory powers in the [[delegation of EPA enforcement authority]] to discourage states from adopting excessively powerful environmental audit privilege laws.&lt;ref name="matters"/&gt;

Some states do not recognize environmental audit privilege, but do provide immunity from civil penalties for the results of internal compliance audits.  These states include [[Minnesota]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/compliance/state-audit-privilege-and-immunity-laws-self-disclosure-laws-and-policies|accessdate=2017-11-23|title=State Audit Privilege and Immunity Laws &amp; Self-Disclosure Laws and Policies|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Republicanism sidebar}}
'''Equality before the law''', also known as '''equality under the law''', '''equality in the eyes of the law''', '''legal equality''', or '''legal egalitarianism''', is the principle that each independent being must be treated equally by the law (principle of [[isonomy]]) and that all are subject to the same laws of justice ([[due process]]).&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the law must guarantee that no individual nor group of individuals should be privileged or discriminated against by the government. Equality before the law is one of the basic principles of [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name="kukathas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="evans" /&gt; This principle arises from various important and complex questions concerning equality, fairness, and [[justice]]. The principle of equality before the law is incompatible and ceases to exist with legal systems such as [[slavery]], [[Indentured servitude|servitude]], [[colonialism]], or [[monarchy]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

Article 7 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) states that "All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, everyone must be treated equally under the law regardless of [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], [[national origin]], [[human skin color|color]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[disability]], or other characteristics, without [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], [[discrimination]] or [[bias]]. The general guarantee of equality is provided by most of the world's national constitutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;q=Equality|title=Read about "Equality" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but specific implementations of this guarantee vary. For example, while many constitutions guarantee equality regardless of race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;key=equalgr4|title=Read about "Equality regardless of race" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; only a few mention the right to equality regardless of nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;key=equalgr2|title=Read about "Equality regardless of nationality" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalist]] [[Guan Zhong]] (720–645 BC) declared that all persons under the jurisdiction of the ruler are equal before the law.

The 431{{nbsp}}BCE [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|funeral oration]] of [[Pericles]], recorded in [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', includes a passage praising the equality among the [[slavery in ancient Greece|free]] male citizens of the [[Athenian democracy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if to social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/plpwr10.txt The History of the Peloponnesian War]'', Written 431 BCE, Translated by [[Richard Crawley]] (1874), retrieved via Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ancient times, violent repression of even basic equality was commonplace. Despite the [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|recent overthrow]] of the [[Roman Kingdom|Roman monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[sacrosanct]] [[Tribunes of the Plebs]], [[Cincinnatus]]'s son [[Caeso Quinctius|Caeso]] led a gang that chased plebs from the [[Roman Forum|forum]] to prevent the creation of equitable written laws. In Rome's case, the organization of the plebs and the patricians' dependence upon them as both laborers and soldiers meant the [[Conflict of the Orders]] was resolved by the establishment of the [[Twelve Tables]] and greater equality. Nominally, all [[Roman citizen|citizens]] except the [[Roman emperor|emperor]] were equal under [[Roman law]] in the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]]. However, this principle was not implemented in most of the world and, even in Europe, the rise of [[aristocracy|aristocracies]] and [[nobility]] created unequal legal systems that lasted into the modern era.

==Classical liberalism==
Classical liberalism calls for equality before the law for all persons.&lt;ref name=kukathas&gt;[[Chandran Kukathas]], "Ethical Pluralism from a Classical Liberal Perspective," in ''The Many Pacqiuo and the One: Religious and Secular Perspectives on Ethical Pluralism in the Modern World'', ed. Richard Madsen and Tracy B. Strong, Ethikon Series in Comparative Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003), p. 61 ({{ISBN|0-691-09993-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Classical liberalism, as embraced by libertarians and modern American conservatives, opposes pursuing [[group rights]] at the expense of [[individual rights]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Mark Evans, ed., ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'' (London: Routledge, 2001), p. 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Lockean liberalism (the foundation for classical liberalism) is interpreted by others, however, as including social rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Two Treatises of Government.'' Peter Laslett, ed., Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1960 (see "Introduction," pp. 114–26).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==
Equality before the law is a tenet of some branches of feminism. In the nineteenth century, gender equality before the law was a radical goal, but some later feminist views hold that formal legal equality is not enough to create actual and social equality between women and men. An ideal of formal equality may penalize women for failing to conform to a male norm, while an ideal of different treatment may reinforce sexist stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Jaggar, Alison. (1994) "Part One: Equality. Introduction." In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ph-2F94pR_0C Living with Contradictions: Controversies in Feminist Social Ethics]''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, prior to serving as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote: "Generalizations about the way women or men are – my life experience bears out – cannot guide me reliably in making decisions about particular individuals. At least in the law, I have found no natural superiority or deficiency in either sex. In class or in grading papers from 1963 to 1980, and now in reading briefs and listening to arguments in court for over seventeen years, I have detected no reliable indicator or distinctly male or surely female thinking – even penmanship.".&lt;ref name=rosen&gt;[[Jeffrey Rosen|Jeff Rosen]], "The Book of Ruth," New Republic, August 2, 1993, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[ACLU]]'s Women's Rights Project in the 1970s, Ginsburg challenged, in ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]]'', the laws that gave health service benefits to wives of servicemen but not to husbands of servicewomen.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dea, Suzanne. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Si6ZVqdOqIgC&amp;pg=PA282 From Suffrage to the Senate: An Encyclopedia of American Women in Politics]'', ABC-CLIO, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 150 national constitutions that currently mention equality regardless of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;key=equalgr1|title=Read about "Equality regardless of gender" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[radical feminists]], however, have opposed equality before the law, because they think that it maintains the weak position of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Chamallas, "Feminist Constructions of Objectivity: Multiple Perspectives in Sexual and Racial Harassment Litigation," Texas Journal of Women and the Law 1 (1992): pp. 95, 125, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal matters==
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}
Article 200 of the [[Criminal Code of Japan]], the penalty regarding [[parricide]], was declared unconstitutional for violating the equality under the law by the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] in 1973.  This was a result of the trial of the [[Tochigi patricide case]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Meryll (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OohyicuN-GIC&amp;pg=PA535#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Japanese legal system'']. [[Routledge]] via [[Google Books]]. p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''First Succession Act''' of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] reign was passed by the [[Parliament of England]] in March 1534. The Act was formally titled the '''Succession to the Crown Act 1533''' (citation [[25 Hen 8]] c 22), or the '''Act of Succession 1533'''; it is often dated as 1534, as it was passed in that calendar year. However, the legal calendar in use at that time dated the beginning of the year as March 25, and so considered the Act as being in 1533.

The Act made Princess [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], daughter of King Henry VIII by [[Anne Boleyn]], who had been born on 7 September 1533, the true successor to the Crown by declaring Princess [[Mary I of England|Mary]], daughter of the King by [[Catherine of Aragon]], a bastard. The Act also required all subjects, if commanded, to swear an [[Oath of Succession|oath]] to recognize this Act as well as the King's supremacy. Under the [[Treasons Act 1534]] anyone who refused to take the oath was subject to a charge of [[treason]].

The Act was later altered by the [[Second Succession Act]], which made Elizabeth illegitimate, and the [[Third Succession Act]], which returned both sisters to the line of succession.

The currently applicable legislation is the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].

The '''hat tax''', or '''hat duty''', was a tax levied by the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British Government]] from 1784 to 1811 on men's hats. The tax was introduced during the first ministry of [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]] and was designed to be a simple way of raising revenue for the government in a rough accordance with each person's relative wealth. It was supposed that the rich would have a large number of expensive hats, whereas the poor might have one cheap hat or none at all.

The hat tax required hat retailers to buy a licence and to display the sign ''Dealer in Hats by Retail''. The cost of the retail licence was two [[pound sterling|pounds]] for London and five [[shilling]]s elsewhere. Each man's hat was required to have a [[revenue stamp]] pasted inside on its lining. 

The cost of the duty depended on the cost of the hat. For hats costing under four shillings, a duty of [[British one penny coin (pre-decimal)|threepence]] was paid. For hats costing between four and seven shillings, sixpence was levied, and a shilling for those between seven and twelve shillings. For expensive hats over twelve shillings, the duty was two shillings. Heavy fines were given to anyone, [[Hatmaking|milliner]] or hat wearer, who failed to pay the hat tax. However, the [[death penalty]] was reserved for forgers of hat-tax revenue stamps.

The hat tax was not the only duty raised by the government on household items. The best known such tax was the [[window tax]], which was implemented in 1697, and was not repealed until 1851. Other similar taxes were the [[dice duty]] (1711–1862), [[almanac tax]] (1711–1834), [[wallpaper tax]] (1712–1836), [[brick tax]] (1784–1850), [[glove tax]] (1785–94), [[hair-powder tax]] (1786–1869) and [[perfume tax]] (1786–1800).

Although, these twenty-seven years saw rapid inflation, a shilling of that period had the purchasing power of about £3.40 today.

For Lafayette and Mother Teresa, the honor was proclaimed directly by an Act of Congress.  In the other cases, an Act of Congress was passed authorizing the President to grant honorary citizenship by proclamation.

==Legal issues==
What rights and privileges honorary citizenship bestows, if any, is unclear. According to State Department documents, it does not grant eligibility for United States passports.&lt;ref name="8fam806.1"&gt;{{cite web|title=8 FAM 306.1: Honorary Citizenship|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM030601.html|work=Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 8|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=18 July 2018|date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Public Law 88-6.png|thumb|400px|Public Law 88-6 (1963) granted honorary citizenship to [[Winston Churchill]].]]

Despite widespread belief that Lafayette received honorary citizenship of the United States before Churchill,&lt;ref name="upi19630311"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hBQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3IsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5629%2C1197058 | title=Sir Winston May Get U.S. Citizenship | work=Sarasota Journal | date=1963-03-11 | agency=UPI | accessdate=25 February 2016 | pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he did not receive honorary citizenship until 2002. Lafayette did become a [[natural-born citizen of the United States|natural-born citizen]] during his lifetime. On 28 December 1784, the [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed a resolution stating that Lafayette and his male heirs "forever shall be...natural born Citizens" of the state.&lt;ref name="otherstates"&gt;Lafayette again became an honorary citizen of Maryland in 1823, as well as of Connecticut the same year.&lt;/ref&gt; This made him a natural-born citizen of the United States under the [[Articles of Confederation]] and as defined in Section 1 of [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="speare"&gt;{{cite news|last=Speare|first=Morris Edmund|title=Lafayette, Citizen of America|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/09/07/98291852.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 September 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|bia1955}}{{r|upi19630311}}&lt;ref name="folliard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Folliard|first=Edward T.|title=JFK Slipped on Historical Data In Churchill Tribute|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19730525&amp;id=NvceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KI0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4641,2939790|accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=[[Sarasota Journal]]|date=25 May 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cornell|first=Douglas B.|title=Churchill Acceptance 'Honors Us Far More'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19630410&amp;id=QzAvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PKoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1037,766571|accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Sumter Daily Item]]|date=10 April 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plumpton1988summer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plumpton|first=John|title=A Son of America Though a Subject of Britain|journal=Finest Hour|date=Summer 1988|issue=60|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/biography/redux/churchill-honored-with-us-citizenship|publisher=[[The Churchill Centre]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lafayette boasted in 1792 that he had become an American citizen before the [[French Revolution]] created the concept of [[French citizenship]].&lt;ref name="twoworlds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lafayette: Citizen of Two Worlds |url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/lafayette/exhibition/english/twoworlds/index.html|work=Lafayette: Citizen of Two Worlds|publisher=[[Cornell University Library]]|accessdate=2012-09-29|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, [[Thomas Jefferson|President Jefferson]] wrote him he would have offered to make him [[Governor of Louisiana]], had he been "on the spot".&lt;ref name="louisiana"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lafayette’s Triumphal Tour: America, 1824-1825|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/lafayette/exhibition/english/tour/|work=Lafayette: Citizen of Two Worlds|publisher=[[Cornell University Library]]|accessdate=2 February 2011|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, descendant [[René de Chambrun]] established his American citizenship based on the Maryland resolution,&lt;ref name="time19401202"&gt;{{cite news|title=Letters|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772450-3,00.html|accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=2 December 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent20020817"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogister |first=John |title=Obituaries: René de Chambrun |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/reneacute-de-chambrun-640100.html |accessdate=2 February 2011 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=17 August 2002 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101151641/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/reneacute-de-chambrun-640100.html |archivedate=January 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was probably ineligible as the inherited citizenship was likely only intended for direct descendants who were heir to Lafayette's estate and title.&lt;ref name="gottschalk1950"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lafayette Between the American and the French Revolution (1783-1789) | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=Gottschalk, Louis Reichenthal | year=1950 | pages=435–436}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] ruled in 1955 that "it is possible to argue" that Lafayette and living male heirs became American citizens when the Constitution became effective on 4 March 1789, but that heirs born later were not U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="bia1955"&gt;{{cite court

|quote=We need not consider the precise effect of the Maryland act of 1784 upon the political status of Lafayette and such of his male heirs as had been born prior to the date when the Constitution of the United States became effective (March 4, 1789). It is possible to argue that they were citizens of Maryland and under Section 2 of Article IV of the United States Constitution should be considered citizens of the United States. However, we hold that when Congress by legislation set forth the requirements for citizenship, the descendents of Lafayette who were born thereafter could only acquire United States citizenship on the terms specified by Congress, and they were not in a position to acquire such citizenship by virtue of the Maryland act of 1784.

Honorary citizenship should not be confused with citizenship or permanent residency bestowed by a [[private bill]]. Private bills are, on rare occasions, used to provide relief to individuals, often in immigration cases, and are also passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.  One such statute, granting [[Elián González affair|Elián González]] U.S. citizenship, was suggested in 1999, but was never enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bash|first=Dana|title=Helms says he aims to offer U.S. citizenship to Elian Gonzalez|url=http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/23/helms.gonzalez/index.html|accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=23 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hostis humani generis''''' ([[Latin]] for "enemy of mankind") is a legal [[term of art]] that originates in [[admiralty law]]. Before the adoption of [[public international law]]{{when?|date=October 2018}}, [[piracy|pirates]] and [[slave trade|slavers]] were already held to be beyond legal protection and so could be dealt with by any nation, even one that had not been directly attacked.

A comparison can be made between this concept and the [[common law]] "writ of [[outlawry]]", which declared a person outside the King's law, a literal out-law, subject to the violence and execution by anyone. The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concept of [[proscription]], and the status of [[homo sacer]] conveyed by proscription may also be similar.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.pl/books?id=3tTfzsdmbl4C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=prescription+homo+sacer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3c-aTIegvb&amp;sig=v2CFrKQJ7oGUQfEZe_ysaSHyU80&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIhZiL8YTcAhUmLsAKHTvHByYQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=prescription%20homo%20sacer&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[International waters]] (also called "the high seas") have their own customs and usage,  rules and articles, and [[law]]s. Unlike the case with [[Earth|land]], above the high-tide mark, where title, ownership, and sovereignty are created by law based around use and possession, no nation may claim as its territory the high seas, for continuous use and possession of them is impossible; as such, no nation may thus forbid [[trespass]] through the high seas. The high seas, since they cannot be owned by anyone, are held [[commons|to belong to all humanity]], and every nation is held to have a separate and equal right to have its ships navigate over them; this is the concept of ''mare liberum'', or the [[freedom of the seas]]. As the sea is the common property of all, the perils of the sea and of navigation are shared by all mariners, and all nations. A law of amity and [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] holds among the seafaring powers, especially in regard to matters related to the protection of life and to a lesser extent, property; for instance, the law stipulates the obligation of every mariner to assist those who are shipwrecked, and the obligation of every harbormaster to provide [[wikt:safe harbor|safe harbor]] to any vessel in need during a storm, regardless of the flag it flies.

Perhaps the oldest of the laws of the sea is the prohibition of [[piracy]], as the peril of being set upon by pirates, who are not motivated by national [[allegiance]], is shared by the vessels and mariners of all nations, and thus represents a crime upon all nations. Since the time of the Ancient Romans, pirates have been held to be individuals waging private warfare, a private campaign of [[Looting|sack]] and [[pillage]], against not only their victims, but against all nations, and thus, pirates hold the peculiar status of being regarded as "hostis humani generis", the enemies of humanity. Since piracy anywhere is a peril to every mariner and ship everywhere, it is held to be the universal right and the universal duty of all nations, regardless of whether their ships have been beset by the particular band of pirates in question, to capture, try by a regularly constituted [[court-martial]] or [[admiralty court]] (in extreme circumstances, by means of a [[drumhead court-martial]] convened by the officers of the capturing ship), and, if found guilty, to [[capital punishment|execute]] the pirate via means of [[hanging]] from the [[yard-arm]] of the capturing ship, an authoritative [[Custom of the Sea]].&lt;ref name="PunishmentOfPirates"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward, ed|first=Graham|title=Under The Brave Black Flag: Pirates and Mutineers|editor=Submission to the [[HMAS Sydney (1934)|HMAS ''Sydney'' II]] Commission of Inquiry|publisher=Ministry of Defense|location=Australia|publication-date=2006-02-21|pages=6th pg. in excerpt|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/sydneyii/SUBM/SUBM.007.0057.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although summary battlefield punishment was conducted by certain nations at certain times with regard to pirates, it was regarded as irregular (but lawful if the attenuation of due process was dictated by urgent military necessity), as individuals captured with pirates could potentially have a defense to charges of piracy, such as coercion.&lt;ref name="SummaryPunishmentIrregular"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brantly, ed.|first=W.T.|date=1831-02-19|title=(The) Summary Method|journal=The Columbian Star &amp; Christian Index|publisher=Martin &amp; Bolden|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA|volume= IV|issue= 8|pages=125|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j7UqAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PRA1-PA125,M1|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in early 1831, the 250-strong crew captured off [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] was brought to Ascension and summarily hanged, as they were acting in a rebellious manner and threatening to overthrow the 30-man crew of HMS ''Falcon'', a British sloop-of-war, which took them captive. As the summary punishment in this case was due to military necessity, there was clear evidence of the offense, and it was done proximate in time and location to the battlefield, it can be classified as merely irregular, and not a violation of the custom of the sea.&lt;ref name="SummaryPunishmentIrregular" /&gt;

In more recent times, much of the customary law of the sea has been codified. Piracy is the broadest exception to the principle that a ship on the [[high seas]] is subject to the protection of, and jurisdiction of, its [[maritime flags|flag state]]. Piracy is considered an offense of [[universal jurisdiction]], such that any state may board and seize a ship engaged in piracy, and any state may try a pirate and impose punitive sanctions in accordance with that state's own laws. Piracy is defined in Article 101 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea]], and the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|1958 Convention on the High Seas]] also regulates this exercise of jurisdiction.

The tradition of classing the pirate as "hostis humani generis" has been expanded to one other particular class of seafaring criminal, that of the [[slave trade|slaver]], who, by trafficking in human flesh upon the high seas, is similarly held to be in a state of war against all humanity. These treaties, as well as the [[customary international law]], allow states to act similarly against slavers.

Although the tradition of [[privateering]] has been in decline over the past several centuries and international treaties are held to have abolished it, privateering, or the use of private ships as raiders of commerce of the enemies of the sovereign whose flag the privateer flies, is not considered piracy but warfare against a particular national enemy, and thus does not represent a crime against the customary international law, provided those involved adhere to the law of naval warfare.

==Theorized extended usages of the term==

The land and airborne analogues of [[maritime piracy|pirates]], [[banditry|bandits]] and [[aircraft hijacking|hijackers]] are not subject to universal jurisdiction in the same way as piracy; this is despite arguments that they should be.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Instead these crimes, along with terrorism, torture, crimes against internationally protected persons&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cppcipp/cppcipp.html The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents](also referred to as the “[[Protection of Diplomats Convention]]”) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 14 December 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; and the financing of terrorism are subject to the ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]'' principle (meaning prosecute or extradite). In the current global climate of international terrorism some commentators have called for terrorists of all sorts to be treated hostis humani generis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/miaicr13&amp;div=12&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals Hostis Humani Generi: Piracy, Terrorism and a New International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commentators, such as [[John Yoo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = John Yoo: Obama, Drones and Thomas Aquinas |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303665904577452271794312802|accessdate=2016-08-13 |date = 2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various U.S. Federal court, have called for the extension of this hypothetical connection of "hostis humani generis" from pirates to hijackers to terrorists all the way to that of "[[unlawful enemy combatants]]". Unlawful enemy combatants, or persons captured in war who do not fight on behalf of a recognized sovereign state, have become an increasingly common phenomenon in contemporary wars, such as [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|War in Afghanistan]], [[Iraq War]], [[Chechen Wars]]{{dn|date=July 2018}} and [[Syrian Civil War]].

==Actual extended usages of the term==

The only actual extension of "hostis humani generis" blessed by courts of law has been its extension to torturers. This has been done by decisions of U.S. and international courts; specifically, in a case tried in the United States in 1980, ''[[Filártiga v. Peña-Irala]]'', [[Case citation|630 F.2d 876]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|United States 2nd Circuit Court]] ruled that it could exercise jurisdiction over agents of the [[Government of Paraguay]] (in their [[individual capacity]]&lt;ref&gt;Under the legal principles of the United States, the government of a nation, as a [[juristic person|legal body]], cannot be held liable for willful or intentional acts against its [[constitution]], the [[law of nations]], or its internal laws. This is because a government is a creature created by action of positive law, and therefore, as a creature of law, cannot act in a matter inimical to the very thing that gives it meaning. However, this poses a problem: what if a government does act unlawfully? How can this conduct be punished? Over the years, the courts have created a [[legal fiction]] so as to give relief to victims of unlawful governmental acts. This fiction supposes that these unlawful acts are not engaged, conspired, or otherwise directed by the government in question, but by the individual officers of a government who carried out the unlawful acts. Therefore, even though a government may not be held liable for acts committed in its name, individual government agents who commit acts against the Constitution or the law of nations can be held personally liable. (Indeed, their liability is heightened, as they acted under [[color of law]], gravely aggravating the magnitude of the offense; see ''[[Ex parte Young]]'', [[Case citation|209 U.S. 123]] (1908), as well as ''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]'', [[Case citation|403 U.S. 388]] (1971).) This provides an incentive to government agents not to "[[Nuremberg Defense|just follow orders]]" when those "orders" are criminal.&lt;/ref&gt;)  who were found to have committed the crime of torture against a Paraguayan citizen, using its jurisdiction under the ''Offenses Clause''&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, Section 8, Clause 10 of the [[Constitution of the United States]], which provides that the [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] is granted the power to "[t]o define and punish Piracies and [[Felonies]] on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations"; this clause both expressly provides that the Congress may [[Codification (law)|codify]] [[customary international law]] into federal law, and implicitly recognizes this law, or, as it has been known, since time immemorial, as the [[Law of Nations]], as a source of law outside of the Constitution, like the [[common law]] is.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Constitution of the United States]], the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], and [[customary international law]]. In deciding this, the court famously stated that "Indeed, for purposes of civil liability, the torturer has become like the pirate and slave trader before him hostis humani generis, an enemy of all mankind." This usage of the term ''hostis humani generis''  has been reinforced by the ruling of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] in the conviction of a torturer in ''Prosecutor v. Furundžija'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Decision of ICTY in Prosecutor v. Furundžija|url=https://www.un.org/icty/furundzija/trialc2/judgement/index.htm|date=1998-12-10|accessdate=2008-09-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080313204736/http://www.un.org/icty/furundzija/trialc2/judgement/index.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janis, M. and Noyes, J. "International Law: Cases and Commentary (3rd ed.)", Page 148 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; marking its acceptance as a peremptory norm, part of the customary international law, held as [[jus cogens]], applying [[erga omnes]], upon any and every state and human individual without exception or reservation whatsoever.

The '''Immigration Act 1971''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/contents c 77]) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] concerning [[immigration]]. The Act, as with the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962]], and that of [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968|1968]], restricts immigration, especially [[primary immigration]] into the UK. It introduced the concept of ''patriality or [[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]]''. It was also partly passed to legally clarify the rights of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth citizens]] within the [[United Kingdom]] in preparation for future membership of the [[European Communities]] which the UK became a member state on 1 January 1973 which gave new automatic rights to EC member state citizens. It is connected in relation to deportation notices, at sections 11 and 23 of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]].
==Background==
Callum Williams argued that foreign-policy pressures led [[Edward Heath]]'s Conservative government to adopt discriminatory Commonwealth immigration policy, which broke from the non-discriminatory immigration policy that had preceded it. The government saw a need to appease Canada, New Zealand and Australia over the future negative impact on them when Britain would join the [[European Economic Community]] that would be hardest on people who had immigrated from Britain in the expectation of continued close ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Callum|title=Patriality, Work Permits and the European Economic Community: The Introduction of the 1971 Immigration Act|journal=Contemporary British History|date=2 October 2015|volume=29|issue=4|pages=508–538|doi=10.1080/13619462.2014.1002775|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13619462.2014.1002775|accessdate=14 November 2017|issn=1361-9462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
One result of the Act was to stop the permanent migration of workers from the Commonwealth. It further elaborated the definition of "patrial" migrants, first introduced in the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]], as persons born in the United Kingdom and persons who had resided there for the previous five years or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marmo |first1=Marinella|last2=Smith|first2=Evan|title=The Myth of Sovereignty: British Immigration Control Policy and Practice in the 1970s|journal=Historical Research |date=17 January 2014|volume=87|issue=236|pages=344–369|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2281.12047/abstract|accessdate=2 January 2017 |doi=10.1111/1468-2281.12047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Penal and Penitentiary Foundation''' ('''IPPF'''; {{lang-fr|Fondation internationale pénale et pénitentiaire}}, {{lang|fr|'''FIPP'''}})  is an international organisation with quasi-governmental status.  It promotes studies on crime-prevention and treatment of offenders, focussing on research, publications and teaching.  It has been approved by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] and holds consultative status at the [[United Nations]] and the [[Council of Europe]].

== History ==
The IPPF can trace its origin to 1872, when the '''International Prison Commission''' (according to some sources the International ''Penitentiary'' Commission) was set up to make recommendations for [[prison reform]]. This commission later became the '''International Penal and Penitentiary Commission''' (IPPC)&lt;ref name=Bolle&gt;Bolle, P.H. (1995) IPPF: activities of the international penal and penitentiary foundation, in: M.C. Bassiouni (Ed.), The Contributions of Specialized Institutes and Non-Governmental Organizations to the United Nations Criminal Justice Program, pp. 295-304&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered the oldest intergovernmental agency in the correctional field.&lt;ref&gt;Sellin, Thorsten. (1964) Lionel Fox and the International Penal and Penitentiary Commission. Studies in Penology. pp 194-207&lt;/ref&gt; The IPPC was affiliated with the [[League of Nations]] and organised conferences on crime control every five years. 

It produced the first set of minimum rules for the treatment of detainees (the [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]]), which were adopted by the League of Nations in 1934 and approved in 1955 at the first [[United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and the Treatment of Offenders]].&lt;ref name=Bolle /&gt;

After World War II, the IPPC was dissolved and its role transferred to the United Nations. The '''International Penal and Penitentiary Foundation''' in its current form was established in 1950 as a [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] officially based in Switzerland, and has been approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations.

== Current Role ==
The IPPF promotes studies on crime-prevention and treatment of offenders through research, publications, teaching and international meetings. The IPPF's members are experts in penal and penitentiary matters from around the world  such as judges, officials in the prison system, and academics.

The IPPF holds consultative status at the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]],  and the [[Council of Europe]]. It provides recommendations and advice on safeguarding [[human rights]] and improving treatment under the penal system.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (1991) The United Nations and Crime Prevention. pp 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its current priorities are a revision of minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners for Latin America and the Caribbean, and prison policy and prisoners' rights.

'''Irish Competition Law''' is the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] body of legal rules designed to ensure fairness and freedom in the [[marketplace]]. The main (but not the only) purpose of Irish competition law is to enhance consumer welfare. The key provisions of Irish competition law: (a) usually outlaw anti-competitive arrangements between businesses and economic operators (known as "undertakings"); (b) always outlaw the abuse of dominance by undertakings; (c) control certain mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures; and (d) control certain activities in the grocery sector.

Irish competition law is primarily statute-based with some judge-made rules (the so-called "common law").  The statute rules are embodied primarily in the Competition Act 2002 (which replaced the Competition Acts 1991-1996), the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006; the Competition (Amendment) Act 2012; and the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.

Irish competition law is comparable to, but quite different in certain key respects, from [[European Union competition law]].  There are some similarities to the [[anti-trust law]] of the [[United States of America]] but the differences (particularly in relation to [[merger]] control, abuse of dominance and the way in which breaches are punished) are substantial.  So it is best to see Irish competition law as sui generis.  For example, the Irish competition agency (the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (the "CCPC")) may not impose fines while many competition agencies worldwide may do so.

Irish competition law is enforced by the courts (which have the power to find breaches, permit unannounced visits by the CCPC) and impose penalties), the CCPC (which has the power to institute investigations and take court actions) and private action by "aggrieved persons" (the latter do not have to be undertakings).  Unlike many other competition agencies (such as the [European Commission]), the CCPC does not, and may not, have the power to impose fines; this is due to the Irish Constitution which limits the power to impose penalties and sanctions to the judicial system (i.e., the courts); some would argue that Irish competition law is a better system for having the filter of the CCPC having to make its case to the police (the Garda Siochana) and the Director of Public Prosecutions before cases are instituted with the extra protection of the judges and, in criminal cases, juries acting as a filter to ensure robust cases are taken.

==Relationship with EU Competition Law==

Irish competition law, Irish law must not contradict or inhibit the operation of EC law, but it may outlaw things which are legal under EU law, or punish breaches more severely. It also exercises a persuasive force over the jurisprudence of Irish competition law. Due to the requirement of compliance with EU law and the similar understanding and goals, Irish Courts will examine cases and precedents in the European Courts to see how it has been interpreted or to ensure that they are consistent. EU competition law has jurisdiction over cases which affect inter-state trade in the Union.

Regulation 1/2003 of the European Commission "decentralised" the enforcement of competition law with a number of reforms designed to increase the enforcement of EC rules in national courts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l26092.htm SCADPlus: Application of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
The law is primarily enforced by the [http://www.ccpc.ie] Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (which replaced the Irish Competition Authority on 31 October 2014), who review mergers, and investigate cartels and abuse of dominance by undertakings. They can fine offenders, when can be appealed to the High Court. Private enforcement is also possible. An aggrieved party may sue the offender for damages under the Competition Act. However this facility has not been exercised much, possibly due to the difficulty of gathering evidence to prove such a breach. Regulation 1/2003 of the European Commission sought to increase private and public enforcement of EC rules in national courts to allow the commission to concentrate on bigger cases.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The CCPC operates a Cartel Immunity Programme which allows for immunity or leniency in sentencing for offenders which supply information to them that allows the prosecution of other breaches of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.ie/EnforcingCompetitionLaw/CartelImmunityProgramme/CartelImmunityProgramme.aspx The Competition Authority - Enforcing Competition Law - Cartel Immunity Programme&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The rule mirrors the European Commission's Leniency policy.

Irish competition law also regulates certain mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures.  Part III of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Competition Authority must approve transactions which fall within the scope of Part III before they may be lawfully implemented.

Ireland has achieved considerable success in enforcing competition law by virtue of successful criminal prosecutions against various individuals and companies.  It has almost thirty convictions for competition law breaches including jury convictions for cartel-related activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">'''John Harriss Langbein''' (born 1941) is the [[Sterling Professor]] of Law and Legal History at [[Yale Law School]].  He is an expert in the fields of [[trusts and estates]], [[comparative law]], and [[Anglo-American law|Anglo-American]] [[legal history]].  

Professor Langbein earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in [[Economics]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1964; his [[LL.B.]] ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1968 from [[Harvard Law School]]; and a second LL.B. in 1969 and a [[Ph.D.]] in 1971 from [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. His Cambridge Ph.D. thesis, "The Criminal Process in the Renaissance," was awarded the [[Yorke Prize]].  He also received an honorary M.A. degree in 1990 from [[Yale University]]. His first appointment was at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], where he taught from 1971 to 1990.  After being named Max Pam Professor of American and Foreign Law, he moved to Yale, where he eventually became a Sterling Professor, the highest-ranking appointment at Yale University.

In the field of trusts and estates, Professor Langbein is known for his scholarship advocating greater flexibility in the application of the [[Wills Act 1837|Wills Act]] formalities, work which led to the adoption of the "harmless error" standard in the [[Uniform Probate Code]]. He has also called attention to the trend whereby human capital has replaced physical capital as the dominant form of wealth transmitted from parent to child.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. John H. Langbein, ''The Twentieth Century Revolution in Family Wealth Transmission'', 86 Mich L. Rev. 722 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fields of [[comparative law]] and [[legal history]], he is best known for his critique of the common-law [[jury]] and [[adversarial procedure]], which he considers inferior to the Continental alternatives, especially the [[Law of Germany|German system]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. John H. Langbein, ''The German Advantage in Civil Procedure'', 52 U. Chi. L. Rev. 823 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Langbein is the author of numerous books and articles.  He has focused in particular on the history of [[criminal procedure]], comparing the Anglo-American tradition to that of the European Continent.  His article, "The Prosecutorial Origins of Defence Counsel in the Eighteenth Century: The Appearance of Solicitors," was awarded the Sutherland Prize by the American Society for Legal History in 2000.  He is also a coauthor of the leading casebook on American pension law, ''Pension &amp; Employee Benefit Law'' (4th ed. 2006). 

Professor Langbein has long been active in law reform.  He has served as an Associate Reporter for the ''Restatement of Property (Third):  Wills and Other Donative Transfers'', and is an adviser to the ''Restatement (Third) of Trusts''.  He is also a Commissioner of the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]], and has served on the drafting committees for several [[List of Uniform Acts (United States)|uniform acts]], including the Uniform Prudent Investor Act (1994), for which he was the Reporter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18205">A '''legal expert system''' is a domain-specific [[expert system]] that uses [[artificial intelligence]] to emulate the decision-making abilities of a human expert in the field of law.&lt;ref name="Susskind, Expert Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susskind|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Susskind|title=Expert Systems in Law: A Jurisprudential Approach to Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning|journal=Modern Law Review|year=1986|volume=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172}} Legal expert systems employ a [[expert system#The rule base or knowledge base|rule base or knowledge base]] and an [[Expert system#The inference engine|inference engine]] to accumulate, reference and produce expert knowledge on specific subjects within the legal domain.

== Purpose ==

It has been suggested that legal expert systems could help to manage the rapid expansion of legal information and decisions that began to intensify in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Schweighofer, Legal Expert System"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schweighofer|first=Erich|first2=Werner|last2 =Winiwarter |title=Legal Expert System KONTERM - Automatic Representation of Document Structure and Contents|journal=DDEXA '93 Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications|year=1993|pages=486|citeseerx = 10.1.1.22.4751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many of the first legal expert systems were created in the 1970s&lt;ref name="Susskind, Expert Systems" /&gt;{{rp|179}}  and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Berman and Hafner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berman|first=Donald H.|first2=Carole D.|last2 =Hafner |title=The Potential of Artificial Intelligence to Help Solve the Crisis in Our Legal System|journal=Communications of the ACM|year=1989|volume=32|issue=8|doi=10.1145/65971.65972}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|928}}

Lawyers were originally identified as primary target users of legal expert systems.&lt;ref name="Thomasset and Paquin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomasset|first=Claude|first2=Louis-Claude|last2=Paquin |title=Expert Systems in Law and the Representation of Legal Knowledge: Can we isolate it from the Why and the Who?|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress on: Logica, Informatica, Diritto: Legal Experts Systems|year=1989|volume=1|url=http://multimedia.uqam.ca/profs/lcp/CV/publi_pdf/Florence_89.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}   Potential motivations for this work included:

* speedier delivery of legal advice;
* reduced time spent in repetitive, labour intensive legal tasks;
* development of knowledge management techniques that were not dependent on staff;
* reduced overhead and labour costs and higher profitability for law firms; and
* reduced fees for clients.&lt;ref name="Stevens and Barot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Charles|first2=Vishal|last2=Barot|first3=Jenny|last3=Carter|title=The Next Generation of Legal Expert Systems - New Dawn or False Dawn?|journal=SGAI Conference Proceedings|year=2010|url=https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2086/4600/NextGenLegalES_version10_FINAL%5B1%5D.pdf?sequence=2|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|439}}

Some early development work was oriented toward the creation of automated judges.&lt;ref name="Schafer ZombAI"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schafer|first=Burkhard|title=ZombAIs: Legal Expert Systems as Representatives "Beyond the Grave"|journal=SCRIPTed|year=2010|volume=7|issue=2|url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol7-2/schafer.asp|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|386}}

Later work on legal expert systems has identified potential benefits to non-lawyers as a means to increase access to legal knowledge.&lt;ref name="Thomasset and Paquin" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

Legal expert systems can also support administrative processes, facilitating decision making processes, [[Automation|automating]] rule-based analyses&lt;ref name="Lodder and Zeleznikow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lodder|first=Arno|first2=John|last2=Zeleznikow |title=Developing an Online Dispute Resolution Environment: Dialogue Tools and Negotiation Support Systems in a Three-Step Model|journal=Harvard Negotiation Law Review|year=2005|volume=10|pages=293|ssrn=1008802|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and exchanging information directly with citizen-users.&lt;ref name="Svensson, Legal"&gt;{{cite book|last=Svensson|first=Jörgen S.|title=Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology|year=2005|publisher=Irma International|pages=1|url=http://www.irma-international.org/viewtitle/14520/|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Architectural variations ===
[[Rule-based system|Rule-based]] expert systems rely on a model of [[deductive reasoning]] that utilizes "if A, then B" rules. In a rule-based legal expert system, information is represented in the form of deductive rules within the knowledge base.&lt;ref name=Aikenhead&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aikenhead|first=M.|title=Legal Knowledge-Based Systems: some observations on the future|journal=Web JCLI|year=1995|volume=2|url=http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles2/aiken2.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Case-based reasoning]] models, which store and manipulate examples or cases, hold the potential to emulate an [[analogical reasoning]] process thought to be well-suited for the legal domain.&lt;ref name=Aikenhead /&gt; This model effectively draws on known experiences our outcomes for similar problems.&lt;ref name="Pal and Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pal|first=Kamalendu|first2=John A.|last2=Campbell |title=An Application of Rule-Based and Case-Based Reasoning within a Single Legal Knowledge-Based System|journal=The DATA BASE for Advances in Information System|year=1997|volume=28|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

A [[neural net]] relies on a computer model that mimics that structure of a human brain, and operates in a very similar way to the case-based reasoning model.&lt;ref name=Aikenhead /&gt;  This expert system model is capable of recognizing and classifying patterns within the realm of legal knowledge and dealing with imprecise inputs.&lt;ref name="Main and Dillon"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Main|first=Julie|title=in Soft Computing in Case Based Reasoning|year=2001|publisher=(Ltd)|location=London|url=http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csckshiu/pdf/shiu01scbrb2.pdf|first2=Sankar K.|last2=Pal | edition=4th|chapter=A Tutorial on Case-Based Reasoning|first3=Tharam|last3=Dillon|first4=Simon|last4=Shiu|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

[[Fuzzy logic]] models attempt to create 'fuzzy' concepts or objects that can then be converted into quantitative terms or rules that are indexed and retrieved by the system.&lt;ref name="Main and Dillon" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}} In the legal domain, fuzzy logic can be used for rule-based and case-based reasoning models.

=== Theoretical variations ===
While some legal expert system architects have adopted a very practical approach, employing scientific modes of reasoning within a given set of rules or cases, others have opted for a broader philosophical approach inspired by jurisprudential reasoning modes emanating from established legal theoreticians.&lt;ref name="Susskind, Expert Systems" /&gt; {{rp|183}}

=== Functional variations ===
Some legal expert systems aim to arrive at a particular conclusion in law, while others are designed to predict a particular outcome. An example of a predictive system is one that predicts the outcome of judicial decisions, the value of a case, or the outcome of litigation.&lt;ref name="Berman and Hafner" /&gt;{{rp|932}}

== Reception ==
Many forms of legal expert systems have become widely used and accepted by both the legal community and the users of legal services.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrogi, Robert. "Latest legal victory has LegalZoom poised for growth." ABA Journal. American Bar Association, 1 Aug. 2014. Web. 17 June 2017. &lt;http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/latest_legal_victory_has_legalzoom_poised_for_growth&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

=== Domain-related problems ===
The inherent complexity of law as a discipline raises immediate challenges for legal expert system [[knowledge engineers]]. Legal matters often involve interrelated facts and issues, which further compound the complexity.&lt;ref name="Stevens and Barot" /&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Schafer ZombAI" /&gt;{{rp|386}}

Factual uncertainty may also arise when there are disputed versions of factual representations that must be input into an expert system to begin the reasoning process.&lt;ref name="Stevens and Barot" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

=== Computerized problem solving ===
The limitations of most computerized problem solving techniques inhibit the success of many expert systems in the legal domain. Expert systems typically rely on deductive reasoning models that have difficulty according degrees of weight to certain principles of law or importance to previously decided cases that may or may not influence a decision in an immediate case or context.&lt;ref name=Aikenhead /&gt;

=== Representation of legal knowledge ===
Expert legal knowledge can be difficult to represent or formalize within the structure of an expert system. For knowledge engineers, challenges include:
* [[Open texture]]: Law is rarely applied in an exact way to specific facts, and exact outcomes are rarely a certainty. Statutes may be interpreted according to different linguistic interpretations, reliance on precedent cases or other contextual factors including a particular judge's conception of fairness.&lt;ref name="Stevens and Barot" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* The balancing of reasons: Many arguments involve considerations or reasons that are not easily represented in a logical way. For instance, many constitutional legal issues are said to balance independently well-established considerations for state interests against individual rights.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=James|title='How much of commonsense and legal reasoning is formalizable? A review of conceptual obstacles|journal=Law, Probability and Risk|year=2012|volume=0|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such balancing may draw on extra-legal considerations that would be difficult to represent logically in an expert system.
* Indeterminacy of legal reasoning: In the adversarial arena of law, it is common to have two strong arguments on a single point. Determining the 'right' answer may depend on a majority vote among expert judges, as in the case of an appeal.&lt;ref name="Schafer ZombAI" /&gt;{{rp|386–387}}

=== Time and cost effectiveness ===
Creating a functioning expert system requires significant investments in [[software architecture]], [[Subject-matter expert|subject matter expertise]] and [[knowledge engineering]]. Faced with these challenges, many system architects restrict the domain in terms of subject matter and jurisdiction. The consequence of this approach is the creation of narrowly focused and geographically restricted legal expert systems that are difficult to justify on a cost-benefit basis.&lt;ref name="Stevens and Barot" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Lack of correctness in results  or decisions ===
Legal expert systems may lead non-expert users to incorrect or inaccurate results and decisions. This problem could be compounded by the fact that users may rely heavily on the correctness or trustworthiness of results or decisions generated by these systems.&lt;ref name="Groothuis and Svensson"&gt;{{cite conference

'''[[Split Up (expert system)|Split-Up]]''' is a rule-based legal expert system that assists in the division of marital assets according to the [[Family Law Act 1975|(Australia) ''Family Law Act (1975)'']].&lt;ref name="Zeleznikow and Stranieri"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeleznikow|first=John|first2=Andrew|last2=Stranieri|first3=Mark|last3=Gawler|title=Project Report: Split-Up - A Legal Expert System which Determines Property Division upon Divorce|journal=Artificial Intelligence and Law|year=1996|volume=3|pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Shyster (expert system)|SHYSTER]]''' is a case-based legal expert system that can also function as a hybrid through its ability to link with rule-based models. It was designed to accommodate multiple legal domains, including aspects of Australian copyright law, contract law, personal property and administrative law.&lt;ref name=Popple /&gt;

'''TAXMAN''' is a rule-based system that could perform a basic form of legal reasoning by classifying cases under a particular category of statutory rules in the area of law concerning corporate reorganization.&lt;ref name=McCarty&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarty|first=L. Thorne|title=Reflections on Taxman: An Experiment in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning|journal=Harvard Law Review|year=1997|volume=90|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|837}}

== Controversies ==
There may be a lack of consensus over what distinguishes a legal expert system from a [[knowledge-based system]] (also called an intelligent knowledge-based system). While legal expert systems are held to function at the level of a human legal expert, knowledge-based systems may depend on the ongoing assistance of a human expert.  True legal expert systems typically focus on a narrow domain of expertise as opposed to a wider and less specific domain as in the case of most knowledge-based systems.&lt;ref name="Stevens and Barot" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

Legal expert systems represent potentially disruptive technologies for the traditional, bespoke delivery of legal services. Accordingly, established legal practitioners may consider them a threat to historical business practices.&lt;ref name="Stevens and Barot" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

Arguments have been made that a failure to take into consideration various theoretical approaches to legal decision making will produce expert systems that fail to reflect the true nature of decision making.&lt;ref name="Susskind, Expert Systems" /&gt;{{rp|190}}  Meanwhile, some legal expert system architects contend that because many lawyers have proficient legal reasoning skills without a sound base in legal theory, the same should hold true for legal expert systems.&lt;ref name=Popple /&gt;{{rp|pp.6–7}}

Because legal expert systems apply precision and scientific rigor to the act of legal decision-making, they may be seen as a challenge to the more disorganized and less precise dynamics of traditional jurisprudential modes of legal reasoning.&lt;ref name=McCarty /&gt;{{rp|839}} Some commentators also contend that the true nature of legal practice does not necessarily depend on analyses of legal rules or principles; decisions are based instead on an expectation of what a human adjudicator would decide for a given case.&lt;ref name="Berman and Hafner" /&gt;{{rp|930}}

== Recent developments ==

Since 2013, there have been significant developments in legal expert systems. Professor Tanina Rostain of [[Georgetown Law Center]] teaches a course in designing legal expert systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/centers-institutes/legal-profession/legal-technologies/legal-expert-systems/&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies such as [[Neota Logic]] have begun to offer [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]]-based legal expert systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://bol.bna.com/automating-legal-advice-ai-and-expert-systems/|Ron Friedman, "Automating Legal Advice: AI and Expert Systems", Bloomberg Law Big Law Business, January 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The former '''Manchester Law Library''' is a [[Grade II* listed building]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Good Stuff IT Services |url=http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-388224-manchester-law-library-14-manchester |title=Manchester Law Library 14 - Manchester - Greater Manchester - England |publisher=British Listed Buildings |date=1974-10-03 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Venetian Gothic]]&lt;ref name="Pevsner"&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner ''The Buildings of England - Lancashire: Manchester and the South East''; p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; style at 14 Kennedy Street, [[Manchester]]. "The building is noteworthy by virtue of having been built for the purposes of a law library and, London and the old universities aside, it is believed to have performed this function for a period longer than any other provincial law library".&lt;ref name="Higginson"&gt;D. J. Higginson, ''The Manchester Law Library: a Short History 1820-1885''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Manchester Law Library 5.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Reading Room]]
Designed by Thomas Hartas,&lt;ref name="Pevsner" /&gt; the library was built by William Holt between 1884 and 1885&lt;ref name="Higginson" /&gt; to provide a meeting place, and reading room, for the Manchester Law Society. The building has a fine Venetian Gothic facade, "three bays, each divided into three again with richly traceried and strongly moulded frames to the openings".&lt;ref name="Pevsner" /&gt;  Internally, a lending library is located on the ground floor, "now with twentieth century furnishings.&lt;ref name="Pevsner" /&gt;  On the first floor, a reading room "with most of the (slightly rearranged) attractive, original fittings."&lt;ref&gt;Clare Hartwell, ''Pevsner Architectural Guides: Manchester''; p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;  These include the central oak table, three fireplaces, and tall bookcases, some set at right angles to the walls to maximise the available storage space. The "stained glass is a noteworthy feature (including) three roundels containing the images of bewigged judges".&lt;ref name="Higginson" /&gt; Offices are above this.

Thomas Hartas is an elusive architect. The Manchester Incorporated Law Library Society website describes him as "famous"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.manchester-law-library.co.uk/|title=The Manchester Incorporated Law Library Society - History|work=manchester-law-library.co.uk |accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is hard to determine whence his fame derives as the Library appears to be his only documented building. Hartas also appears not to have an entry in the [[RIBA]] ''Directory of British Architects 1834-1914'' which is an exhaustive survey of practising architects of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHii4haIULEC&amp;pg=PA840&amp;lpg=PA840&amp;dq=Pennington+and+Bridgen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kwb1GERni-&amp;sig=O2UK5_hRoEXZmMDaikH7R8Hpck4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M1w9T6rRFMmDhQeanOTdBQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Pennington%20and%20Bridgen&amp;f=false |title=Directory of British Architects 1834-1914: A-K - Antonia Brodie, British Architectural Library - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=1906-06-11 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the building was put up for sale.  The Law Library relocated to new premises on Deansgate where it remains a private library open only to subscribing members of the legal profession.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4328">'''Medical Communications for Combat Casualty Care''' (MC4) is a deployable health support [[information management]] system of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].  

MC4 integrates, fields and provides technical support for a comprehensive medical information system enabling lifelong electronic medical records, streamlined medical logistics and enhanced [[situation awareness|situational awareness]] for Army operational forces. By accomplishing this mission, the MC4 Product Management Office (PMO) provides the U.S. Army’s solution to the Presidential and Congressional objectives set-forth by U.S. Code [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]] in 1997, which called for a medical tracking system for all deployed Service members. For up-to-date information about MC4, visit [http://www.mc4.army.mil The Gateway].

== Software &amp; Hardware ==
MC4 is a (semi-) ruggedized system-of-systems containing medical software packages fielded to operational medical forces worldwide. The MC4 PMO provides Army-specific infrastructure (MC4 system) to support deployment of the Defense Health Information Management System (DHIMS), Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) products. The TMIP-J applications include software for electronic medical record (EMR) documentation, a web-based application that serves as a deployed EMR repository and a web-based application for conducting battlefield surveillance.

Although the MC4 program doesn't create the software, the MC4 program does provide the tools needed to digitally record and transfer critical medical data from the foxhole to medical treatment facilities around the world. 

MC4 is more than an EMR. The MC4 system is the Army's tactical medical information system including software from multiple sources, future systems and applications, package fielding and technical support. 

Deployable medical forces use the MC4 system to gain quick, accurate access to patient histories and forward casualty resuscitation information. The system also provides automated tools facilitating patient and item tracking, blood management, medical reporting and medical logistical support.

== Training, Fielding &amp; Support ==
MC4 provides new equipment training while Unit Commanders are responsible for sustainment training. MC4 is always looking at new ways to provide training that aligns with its charter and resources. 

First deployed in 2003, MC4 has fielded systems to tactical medical units throughout [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]] and [[Afghanistan]], making it the most comprehensive information management/information technology medical system deployed to date.

MC4 support personnel assure system sustainability. 

This commitment is supported by regional support centers in the U.S., South Korea, Europe, Kuwait, and currently Afghanistan as well as a 24-7, online helpdesk, providing a worldwide sustainment and technical support structure.

== Supporting the Future ==
The U.S. Army recognizes that the MC4 system is an evolving capability required to support current and emerging medical information technologies needed by deployed medical forces.  

As such, MC4 is strategically integrating with future Army systems, including PEO Soldier. MC4 will provide an interface to these systems that enables automated assessment and remote monitoring capabilities for deployed medical forces.

== Summary ==
*MC4 provides deployed medical forces (1) quick, accurate access to patient histories and forward, (2) casualty resuscitation information, and (3) automation tools facilitating (a) patient tracking, (b) medical reporting, and (c) medical logistics support.
*MC4 provides combatant commanders (1) medical surveillance information, (2) theater-wide trend analysis capabilities, and (3) enhanced medical situational awareness.
*MC4 provides Service members (1) secure, accessible, lifelong electronic medical records, (2) easier access to medical benefits, (3) peace of mind, and (4) better-informed healthcare providers.

{{about|legal jurisdiction over military personnel|military jurisdiction over civilians|martial law}}
{{war}}

'''Military justice''' (or '''military law''') is the [[legal system|body of laws]] and procedures governing members of the [[armed forces]]. Many [[country|nation-states]] have separate and distinct bodies of law that govern the conduct of members of their armed forces.  Some states use special judicial and other arrangements to enforce those laws, while others use [[civilian law|civilian judicial system]]s.  Legal issues unique to military justice include the preservation of good order and discipline, the [[legality of orders]], and [[appropriate conduct]] for members of the military. Some states enable their military justice systems to deal with [[civil offense]]s committed by their armed forces in some circumstances.

Military justice is distinct from [[martial law]], which is the imposition of military authority on a civilian population as a substitute for civil authority, and is often declared in [[times of emergency]], [[war]], or [[civil unrest]]. Most countries restrict when and in what manner martial law may be declared and enforced.

==Canada==
All Commands of the [[Canadian Forces]] (CF) (that is, Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Air Force, Canadian Joint Operations Command, and Canadian Special Operations Forces Command) are primarily governed by the [[National Defence Act]] (NDA).  Section 12 of the NDA§ authorizes the governor in council's creation of the [[Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces|Queen's Regulations and Orders]] (QR&amp;Os).  The QR&amp;Os are subordinate legislation having the force of law.  Since the principle of ''[[Delegata potestas non potest delegari|delegatus non-potest delegare]]'' has not achieved rigid standing in Canada, the QR&amp;Os authorize other military officials to generate orders having similar, but not equal, status.  These instruments can be found in the [[Canadian Forces Administrative Orders]] and Defence Administrative Orders and Directives; they are used as direction for authorities within the CF to administer the day-to-day considerations of the Forces.  For example, officer cadets attending military college are organized and subject to regulations more appropriate for their academic success than the enforcement of discipline, as might be expected of fully trained members.  Volume IV, Appendix 6.1 of The Queen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Military Colleges (QR Canmilcols) applies.

A [[Judge Advocate General (Canada)|judge advocate general]] (JAG) has headed the Canadian military legal branch since before the [[First World War]]. The branch interprets the [[Canadian Forces]]' own internal rules and code of discipline, and also international and humanitarian laws and codes of war, such as the [[Geneva Convention]]s. In Canadian practice, armed combat is a strictly regulated environment and legal officers are a crucial part of the planning that goes into operational decisions. The Military Law Centre on the grounds of [[Royal Military College of Canada]], staffed with military lawyers, oversees the education of officers and troops in legal matters, trains military lawyers and advises Ottawa on matters of policy and [[doctrine]]. Legal education is integrated into the regular training that CF members undergo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thewhig.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=799178&amp;auth=Ian+Elliot |title=The Whig Standard – Ontario, CA |access-date=22 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709065047/http://www.thewhig.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=799178&amp;auth=Ian+Elliot |archive-date=9 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==

===Jurisdiction===
The Finnish military law concerns the members of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] and the [[Finnish Border Guard]]. The military jurisdiction encompasses all military persons: conscripts, students training for a paid military position, females serving voluntarily and paid military personnel. However, military chaplains are outside the criminal military jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="vna rikoslaista" /&gt;{{rp|§ 4}}
Reservists belong to the military jurisdiction when activated voluntarily or involuntarily. The military jurisdiction starts from the moment when a person reports to duty or was liable to report to duty and lasts to the moment when the person has been discharged from service and, in case of conscripts and involuntarily activated reservists, has also left the military area. During wartime, also civilians serving in the Defence Forces or in civilian institutions that have been put under the direction of Defence Forces are under military jurisdiction.&lt;ref name ="vna rikoslaista"&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2000/20001153 Valtioneuvoston asetus sotilasrikoksia koskevien rangaistussäännösten soveltamisalasta  (1153/2000)]. (Government decree on the application of military criminal statutes) Retrieved 2015-08-30. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§§1–2}}&lt;ref name="rikoslaki"&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 Rikoslaki (39/1889)] (Penal code). Retrieved on 2015-08-30. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§§ 45:27–28}} Enemy [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] fall under Finnish military jurisdiction during their imprisonment.&lt;ref name="rikoslaki" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

===Military crimes===
Like in Germany, persons under military jurisdiction are under the usual civilian criminal law. The military criminal law, the 45th Chapter of the penal code, encompasses only the crimes which only military persons can commit. The most important of these are various types of "service crime" ({{lang-fi|palvelusrikos}}) which encompasses all voluntary and negligent disobedience of orders and regulations, "guard crime" ({{lang-fi|vartiorikos}}), encompassing any misdeed during guarding duty, absence without leave ({{lang-fi|luvaton poissaolo}}), desertion ({{lang-fi|sotilaskarkuruus}}), diverse forms of disobedience against superiors, misuses of a position as superior and behaviour unsuitable for military person ({{lang-fi|sotilaalle sopimaton käyttäytyminen}}). Other crimes are subject to usual civilian law.&lt;ref name="rikoslaki" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 45}}

The military has a jurisdiction to investigate all military crimes proper, and also a number of other crimes that have been specifically listed as belonging to the military jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="SKPL"&gt;[https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2014/20140255 Laki sotilaskurinpidosta ja rikostorjunnasta puolustusvoimissa (255/2014)]. (Act on maintenance of military discipline and crime fighting in the Defence Forces)]. Retrieved 2015-08-30. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§ 1}} These include e.g. various types of murder, assault, theft, fraud, forgery, computer hacking and illegal divulging of classified information. However, they are only under military jurisdiction if the crime has been committed against another military person or against the Defence Forces.&lt;ref name="rikoslaki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOKL"&gt;[https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1983/19830326 Sotilasoikeudenkäyntilaki (326/1983)]. Retrieved 2015-08-30. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§ 2}}

Unlike other crimes, the military crimes have separate sentence ranges for peace and wartime. During wartime, the crimes carry considerably larger sentence ranges and, if the crime causes the danger to the military unit, the sentence range is even harsher. For example, desertion carries, in the peacetime, a sentence of disciplinary punishment or up to one year in prison. During wartime, it carries a mandatory prison sentence of not more than four years, and, if the crime caused a particularly immediate danger to the unit, a mandatory minimum of one year, with a maximum sentence of ten years.&lt;ref name="rikoslaki" /&gt;{{rp|§§45:10,20,23}}

When the military has jurisdiction over an ordinary crime, and the crime carries fine as a punishment, a disciplinary punishment may be given instead of fine both in summary proceedings and in the courts of law.&lt;ref name="SKPL"/&gt;{{rp|§4}}

===Investigation and summary discipline===
When the crime falls under military jurisdiction, it is usually investigated by the serviceman's own unit. During such investigation, the serviceman's superior and the company commander have the power to detain the suspect. The battalion commander and military police officers have also the right to arrest the suspect and to conduct searches inside a military area.&lt;ref name="SKPL" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 4}}

When the company commander or his superior feels that the crime is non-trivial and requires professional investigation, they may submit the issue to the [[Defence Command (Finland)|Defence Command]] for investigation. The Defence Command has, in addition to the power of arrest, the power to use almost all other measures that are available to the [[Law enforcement in Finland|Finnish police]]. If the Defence Command requires the use of the most invasive investigative measures (e.g. wiretaps, use of deep cover agents or computer intrusion) they may either request the police to conduct the measure or hand over the case to the police, as agreed between the investigator and the competent policeman. If the police considers it necessary, they may always take the case over, however.&lt;ref name="SKPL" /&gt;{{rp|§§35–39}}

In the Border Guard, the Border Guard headquarters has the same internal law enforcement authority as the Defence Command in the Defence Forces, in addition to the regular law enforcement powers of the Border Guard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2005/20050577 Laki rajavartiolaitoksen hallinnosta (577/2007)] (Act on the administration of Border Guard), § 31. Retrieved 2015-08-30. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the investigation is ready, the case is brought to the company commander or sergeant major or for his superior for consideration. After hearing the suspect, the disposing superior either frees the suspect from suspicion or gives an appropriate punishment within the range allowed to him.&lt;ref name="SKPL" /&gt;{{rp|§§46, 51}} The range is&lt;ref name="SKPL" /&gt;{{rp|§§3,12}}
* Company sergeant major: a private warning, up to three shifts of extra duty (only to conscripts and involuntarily activated reservists)
* Company commander: a private warning, up to five shifts of extra duty, up to 10 days of confinement to the garrison, a public [[letter of reprimand]] ({{lang-fi|varoitus}})
* Battalion commander, all of above, and up to fifteen days of confinement to garrison
* Brigade commander and his superiors: all of above and up to 30 disciplinary fines, one disciplinary fine being one fifth of the individual's daily gross income, or for conscripts, at least conscript's daily allowance.

During peacetime, professional soldiers (with the exception of certain soldiers deployed to international missions) cannot be given other disciplinary punishment than a public letter of reprimand or a fine.&lt;ref name="SKPL" /&gt;{{rp|§9}}

If the superior does not feel that his powers allow him to give sufficient punishment, he will transfer the matter to the next higher superior. When the brigade commander determines that he cannot give sufficient punishment, he will transfer the matter to the public prosecutor who will commence prosecution in a civilian court.&lt;ref name="SKPL" /&gt;{{rp|§ 48}} If the serviceman feels that the punishment was unjust, he can appeal to the brigade commander. The brigade commander's decision can be appealed to the district court within seven days. However, the appeals will not prevent the execution of the punishment.&lt;ref name ="SKPL" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 6 and §69}}

===Trial and appeals===

The military crimes that go to court are handled by civilian courts that have military members. The district court has a learned civilian judge and two military members. One of them is an officer and the other a warrant officer, an NCO or a private. The court of appeals, that acts as the first instance for the prosecution of officers with at least major's rank, will have a military member who has at least a major's rank. The [[Supreme Court of Finland]] has two officers with at least colonel's rank as members when handling military crimes.&lt;ref name ="SOKL" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 3 and §3}} These members are not named for a specific case but serve for two-year terms. The military members of the district court are selected by the court of appeals on the motion of the Commander of the [[Finnish Army]]. The military members of the Courts of Appeals are selected by the Ministry of Justice on motion of the Ministry of Defence. The military members of the Supreme Court are selected by the [[President of Finland]].&lt;ref name="SOKL" /&gt;{{rp|§11}}

The sentences of the courts for military crimes are served in civilian prisons. An exception is formed by the disciplinary arrest, which may be sentenced for up to 30 days and is served in the detention facilities of the convict's garrison.

When the military person holds a permanent or temporary paid position as a state military servant ({{lang-fi|sotilasvirkamies}}), as all officers and NCOs in regular active service do, they will be sentenced to dismissal ({{lang-fi|viraltapano}}) in addition to other punishments, if they are convicted of a military or a civilian crime for more than two years in prison and there are no special grounds for leniency. If the sentence is a life sentence, dismissal is mandatory. The court may also sentence dismissal with a shorter prison sentence if the crime shows that the person is unsuitable for state employment.&lt;ref name="rikoslaki" /&gt;{{rp|§2:10}}

If the military person is no longer in service, the summary disciplinary procedure cannot be used and the military has no longer any law enforcement power over the issue. In such cases, the former service member is investigated by the civilian police but the case is handled by a court with military members. In sentencing, disciplinary punishments cannot be used. Instead if a disciplinary punishment, an ordinary [[day-fine]] is sentenced.&lt;ref name="rikoslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§6:1}} Typically, this is the case when a reservist is absent from an obligatory refresher exercise or a conscript is, after the commission of crime, declared unfit for duty for medical or security reasons.

===Administrative punishment===
In addition to judicial dismissal, the Defence Forces and the Border Guard have the option of administratively ending the military person's service if the person is in a paid position. This can happen even if no criminal charges are pressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1994/19940750 Valtion virkamieslaki (750/1994)]. (State civil servants Act). §25, 33. Retrieved 2015-08-30. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Defence Forces, the professional serviceman can also be administratively suspended for a period of one to six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2007/20070551 Laki puolustusvoimista (551/2007)] (Act on the Defence Forces), §49.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to state military servants, persons serving in a deployed force on an international mission may be administratively dismissed by the commander of the Finnish contingent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2006/20060211 Laki sotilaallisesta kriisinhallinnasta (211/2006)]. §10. Retrieved on 2015-08-30. {{Fi}}. N.b Members of a Finnish contingent in a crisis management mission are not considered state military servants unless they hold that position in a domestically serving unit. (Most members do not, but will return to civilian employment after the tour of duty.) Instead, they have a special service relationship to the state, thus necessitating differentiation between state military servants and crisis management personnel.&lt;/ref&gt; A conscript or a reservist cannot be dismissed but their service can be suspended by the brigade commander if they are suspected of having committed a crime which shows that they may endanger the safety of others. Following this, the person may be declared permanently unfit for duty by the Defence Forces regional office for safety and security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2007/20071438 Asevelvollisuuslaki (1438/2007)] (Conscription Act). §§ 10 and 60. Retrieved 2015-08-30. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an exception to the principle that the military jurisdiction concerns only military persons, the penal code provides for the loss of military rank. Any person who is sentenced to prison for at least two years or to prison for any length of time for a crime of treasonous nature (specifically, crimes in chapters 11 and 12 of the Penal Code, e.g. espionage, high treason and related crimes), shall be sentenced to lose their military rank also. Thus, not only active military persons but also retired personnel, reservists and persons who are too old to belong to reserve may lose their military ranks for crimes of civilian nature.&lt;ref name="rikoslaki" /&gt;{{rp|§2:14a}}

===Statistics===
Military crimes are relatively common in Finland. Partly this is due to the fact that the bar of criminality has been set consciously low. The crime of absence without leave is committed by a soldier who is even a minute late, and a slightest wilful or negligent disregard for a standing order or a regulation fulfils the indicia of the "service crime". The legislator has purposefully given the military superiors the legal tools by which to maintain discipline by punishing even the slight appearances of bad conduct if they feel it necessary. On the other hand, handing out unofficial punishments is discouraged in the extreme.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eduskunta.fi/valtiopaivaasiakirjat/HE+17/1999 Hallituksen esitys eduskunnalle laiksi rikoslain 2 luvun 14 a §:n ja 45 luvun muuttamisesta ja eräiksi siihen liittyviksi laeiksi] (HE 17/1999vp). Retrieved 2015-08-31.{{fi}}.&lt;br&gt;The claim may seem extraordinary. The exact quote from the Government's proposal for the amendment of Penal Code is ''Rangaistavan palvelusvelvollisuuden rikkomisen ala on ehdotetussa ja myös voimassa olevassa pykälässä laajempi kuin rangaistavan virkavelvollisuuden rikkomisen ala rikoslain 40 luvun 10 §:ssä, koska rangaistavuudelle ei ole asetettu vähäisyyskynnystä. Tämä on kuitenkin perusteltua, sillä käytäntö on osoittanut, että erityisesti sotilasyhteisössä mahdollisimman varhaisessa vaiheessa tapahtuva puuttuminen kuria ja järjestystä vaarantaviin suhteellisen lieviinkin ilmiöihin on tehokas keino vähentää vakavampien rikosten määrää.''&lt;br&gt;This translates as &lt;br&gt;''The extent of punishable disregard for duty is both in the proposed and existing legislation wider than that of punishable disregard for civil servant's duty as defined in the Section 10, Chapter 40 of the Penal Code, as there is no minimum threshold below which the disregard wpuld not be criminal. This is, nonetheless, well founded, for practical experience has demonstrated that especially in a military community, measures taken as early as possible to curtail phenomena endangering discipline and order, however slight they may seem, are an efficient way to minimize the number of more serious crimes.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/entisaikojen-armeijaperinne-tulkitaan-nykyaan-simputukseksi-ei-missaan-nimessa-sallittua/701500/ Entisaikojen armeijaperinne tulkitaan nykyään simputukseksi – ”Ei missään nimessä sallittua”] Kaleva 2015-07-06. Retrieved 2015-08-31. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of military crimes is yearly somewhat above 4,000. An absolute majority of these are handled by summary measures, i.e. by a punishments given by the military superiors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eduskunta.fi/valtiopaivaasiakirjat/HE+30/2013 Hallituksen esitys eduskunnalle laiksi sotilaskurinpidosta ja rikostorjunnasta puolustusvoimissa sekä eräiksi siihen liittyviksi laeiksi].

==Germany==
Members of any branch of the [[Bundeswehr]], the German armed forces, are subject to the ordinary civil jurisdiction and unless otherwise stated all civil laws apply to soldiers as well.

The German constitution allows the federal government in art. 96 II to create military courts under special circumstances: in times of war, outside Germany or on a German vessel, acting under a legal judge and only for members of the armed forces. In fact, no such laws have been enacted so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gg/art_96.html |title=Grundgesetz Artikel 96 II |publisher=Bundesrecht.juris.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, suspects of crimes committed abroad are subject to the district attorney of the city of [[Potsdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sta-potsdam.brandenburg.de/sixcms/list.php?template=content_list_stpdm_gesch&amp;query=allgemein_stpdm&amp;sv%5Brelation_stpdm.gsid%5D=lbm1.c.224182.de&amp;sort=lfdnr&amp;order=asc |title=Staatsanwaltschaft Potsdam |publisher=Sta-potsdam.brandenburg.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that the operational headquarters (''Einsatzführungskommando'') is located there.

Nonetheless, there exist numerous acts that only concern soldiers describing their special status, their rights and duties. The military penal code (''Wehrstrafgesetz'') applies to soldiers by extending the civil penal code (''Strafgesetzbuch'') to crimes that can be only committed on military duty: General offenses (such as desertion, illegal use of weapons and more) and offenses that interfere with the military hierarchy (such as mutiny or abuse).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wstrg/index.html |title=Wehrstrafgesetz |publisher=Gesetze-im-internet.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcing inside any branch is done by the [[military police]], the [[Feldjäger]]. When investigating, working for the attorney is equivalent to any [[Law enforcement in Germany|German police]] in civil issues. In cases of both groups involved (on German terrain), regular and military police cooperate. In emergencies, the regular police is authorized to maintain order until the military police has arrived.

Soldiers that violate military regulations may also receive penalties in form of [[Non-judicial punishment]] or in severe cases judicial punishments by a special type of court. These procedures are defined by the military discipline code (''Wehrdisziplinarordnung'', WDO). Note that the WDO describes how to proceed on offenses that are not (yet) covered by the military penal code but clearly against a military regulation. The head of the unit as [[Command and obedience in the Bundeswehr|immediate superior]] who acts as primary disciplinary master has the exclusive right to choose: non-judicial punishment (such as fines, curfews, arrests up to 7 days), forwarding the decision to the next superior officer of the unit (arrest then can be extended up to 21 days) or calling the military service court (''Truppendienstgericht'') which has the power for further punishment (like degradation and shortening the salary up to five years). The judge of such a court is a civil one, two military officers are attending every case and act as consultants to the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wdo_2002/index.html |title=Wehrdisziplinarordnung |publisher=Gesetze-im-internet.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, there are no federal or [[military prison]]s. If a soldier is sentenced to jail for up to six months, the punishment is executed by the soldier's [[barracks]] administration. He will remain in arrest for the same time but continue serving in his unit on duty times unless the court has imposed further limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wstrg/__12.html |title=Military penal code of Germany |publisher=Gesetze-im-internet.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise soldiers will be detained in civil state prisons. In the case of a soldier being sentenced to jail for one year or more (6 months or more in case of bribery) he will be discharged from the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sg/__48.html |title=Soldier's law of Germany |publisher=Gesetze-im-internet.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
India has its own [[Army Act]], Navy Act and Air Force Act.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
These laws define the statutory provisions as applicable to men and women in uniform. All these three Acts are available on search from the official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/ |title=indiacode.nic.in |publisher=indiacode.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are certain para military forces in India too who have laws akin to the ones applicable to defence services. This includes the [[Border Security Force]] Act, Coast Guard Act, [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] Force Act and the [[Assam Rifles]] Act. All such Acts draw their inspiration from the Army Act.

The military courts in India are coming under extreme stress with the establishment of [[Armed Forces Tribunal]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20111104/edit.htm#6%20 |title=AFT |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is increasing voice in the country for the reform on the lines other liberal democracies are seeing in their military justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/72103577/CorruptionMJS-SingleColumn |title=Corruption in Military Justice System |publisher=Scribd.com |date=22 January 1947 |accessdate=2012-07-10}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

{{further|AGAI 67}}
The United Kingdom's arrangements for justice in the armed forces dates back many centuries to the [[Articles of War]].  In the late 19th Century this was added to the annual Army Act and embodied in the [[Naval Discipline Act]].  The [[Air Force Act]] was added in 1918.  In 1966 a process of harmonisation started with the introduction of a [[quinquennial]] Armed Forces Act. The [[Armed Forces Act 2006]] replaces the three separate service discipline acts and earlier Armed Forces Acts as the system of law under which the Armed Forces operate. In the previous decade the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) had considerable impact on the administration of military justice, particularly the need for the independence of the courts martial system. Nevertheless, the underlying premise of the service justice system is that discipline is a matter for commanders.

The [[Armed Forces Act 2006]] completed the harmonisation of service law, and took full effect on 1 November 2009. Guidance about its application and related matters are provided in the Manual of Service Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/42A2F5FC-9FB9-42AB-A224-C25820AA23C6/0/vol1and2mslver1.pdf Manual of Service Law], Ministry of Defence, [[Joint Service Publication]] (JSP) 830, Volumes 1 – 3.  Vol 1 and 2 Edition 1.0 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104174306/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/42A2F5FC-9FB9-42AB-A224-C25820AA23C6/0/vol1and2mslver1.pdf |date=4 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One motivating factor behind the changes in the legislation combining discipline acts across the armed forces is the trend towards tri-service operations and defence organisations. It deals with [[Offences against military law in the United Kingdom|military offences]], civil offences committed in some circumstances, offences by [[Civilian subject to service discipline|civilians associated with the armed forces or with the armed forces overseas]] (including family members), authority of Commanding Officer to deal with offences [[Military Courts of the United Kingdom#Summary hearing by Commanding Officer|summarily]], the [[Military Courts of the United Kingdom#Court Martial|Court Martial]], the [[Service Civilian Court]], custody and appeals.  The Act also creates the post of the [[Director of Service Prosecutions]].

Summary dealing by a Commanding Officer (CO) is the central feature, this is acceptable within the ECHR because an accused always has the right to elect trial by the Court Martial.  Most cases are dealt with summarily. Typically a CO is a Lieutenant Colonel or equivalent (NATO grade OF-4), but a CO may delegate some powers of summary dealing to a subordinate.  The superior officer of a CO, a Higher Authority, may vary a CO's powers of summary dealing.  An implication is that every person subject to service law must have a CO, and a CO must have a Higher Authority.

The military judicial system is headed by the [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Judge Advocate General]] who is a civilian and part of the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Causes and Effects of a Military Court Martial|url=http://www.grayandcosolicitors.co.uk/the-causes-and-effects-of-a-military-court-martial/|publisher=www.grayandcosolicitors.co.uk|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative procedures enable a service man or women to be discharged for unsatisfactory behaviour in a process similar to that in the private sector.  They also allow a superior of any rank to award up to three extra duties or similar to a subordinate for minor infractions.  Since being introduced this has significantly reduced the number of cases dealt with summarily.

==United States==
{{see also|Judge Advocate General's Corps}}
The [[United States Constitution]] authorized the creation of a system of military justice.  Article I, Section 8 permits the U.S. Congress to "make rules for the government and regulation of the [[U.S. Armed Forces|land and naval forces]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 8]]&lt;/ref&gt; Congress issued these rules first in 1806 as the [[Articles of War#United States of America|Articles of War]]. Military justice during the [[American Civil War]] was governed by the 1863 [[Lieber Code]]. The Articles of War were superseded in 1951 by the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ).

The UCMJ is federal law, found in Title 10 [[United States Code]] Chapter 47, and implemented by the [[Manual for Courts-Martial]], an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] issued by the President of the United States in his capacity as [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. Court-martial convictions in the United States may be appealed through [[military court]]s of appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] (CAAF), a federal appellate court consisting of five civilian judges appointed by the President of the United States.  CAAF decisions are subject to direct review by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

The offenses covered by the UCMJ include those encompassed by "[[high crimes and misdemeanors]]" which covers officials generally, and includes perjury of oath, [[abuse of authority]], bribery, intimidation, misuse of assets, failure to supervise, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming, and refusal to obey a lawful order. It also includes ordinary crimes, but perhaps with different standards of proof and punishment than for civilians, on the grounds that more is expected of military personnel by their oaths of office. Many of the terms used date back to the era during which the code was written.

'''''Nunn v. State'',''' 1 Ga. (1 Kel.) 243 (1846) is a [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] ruling that a state law ban on handguns was an [[unconstitutional]] violation of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]. This was the first gun control measure to be overturned on Second Amendment grounds.&lt;ref name="Ph.D.Carter2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ph.D.|first1=Gregg Lee Carter|last2=Carter|first2=Gregg Lee|title=Guns in American Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD46JBOhMU0C&amp;pg=PA647|accessdate=9 March 2013|date=2012-05-31|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313386701|pages=647–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1837, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] passed a law banning the sale and carry of certain types of weapons included [[bowie knife|Bowie]] and other types of knives, and pistols.   Hawkins H. Nunn was charged and convicted for carrying a pistol in violation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1st enacts, "that it shall not be lawful for any merchant or vender of wares or merchandize in this State, or any other person or persons whatever, to sell, or to offer to sell, or to keep or to have about their persons, or elsewhere, any of the herein-after-described weapons, to wit: Bowie or any other kinds of knives, manufactured and sold for the purpose of wearing or carrying the same as arms of offence or defence; pistols, dirks, sword-canes, spears, &amp;c., shall also be contemplated in this act, save such pistols as are known and used as horseman's pistols," &amp;c. Nunn, 1 Ga. 243 at 246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Utter2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Utter|first=Glenn H.|title=Encyclopedia of gun control and gun rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYMYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=7 March 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oryx Press|isbn=9781573561723}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He appealed the ruling, claiming the state law was a violation of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  He did not make a claim under the Georgia constitution because Georgia, unlike many other states, did not have a similar protection of the [[right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] within its constitution.&lt;ref name="Cramer1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cramer|first=Clayton E.|title=For the defense of themselves and the state: the original intent and judicial interpretation of the right to keep and bear arms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LmRAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 March 2013|year=1994|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780275949136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halbrook1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halbrook|first=Stephen P.|title=A Right to Bear Arms: State and Federal Bills of Rights and Constitutional Guarantees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fyn9B9zwAjEC|accessdate=7 March 2013|year=1989|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313265396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling==
The ''Nunn'' court ruled that while the legislature could prohibit the concealed carry of weapons, it could not prohibit the open carry of weapons.  To do so would be a violation of the Second Amendment right to carry weapons for self-defense.  As there was no proof that Nunn had been carrying his pistol concealed, the conviction was overturned.

{{quote|We are of the opinion, then, that so far as the act of 1837 seeks to suppress the practice of carrying certain weapons secretly, that it is valid, inasmuch as it does not deprive the citizen of his natural right of self-defence, or of his constitutional right to keep and bear arms. But that so much of it, as contains a prohibition against bearing arms openly, is in conflict with the Constitution, and void; and that, as the defendant has been indicted and convicted for carrying a pistol, without charging that it was done in a concealed manner, under that portion of the statute which entirely forbids its use, the judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the proceeding quashed.&lt;ref name="Nunn, 1 Ga. 243 at 251"&gt;Nunn, 1 Ga. 243 at 251.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legal analysis==
The court relied on guidance from other state decisions and general theories of rights to explain its decision.

===Other state courts===
The ''Nunn'' court referenced ''Bliss v. Commonwealth'', 12 Ky. (2 Litt.) 90, 13 Am. Dec. 251 (1822) and State v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 35 Am. Dec. 44 (1840).  In ''Bliss'', the defendant was charged with carrying a weapon concealed, in violation of a Kentucky statute.  The ''Bliss'' court invalidated the law as a diminution of the Kentucky constitution which provided, "that the right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State, shall not be questioned."  The court reasoned that the right as defined has no limits and "in fact consists of nothing else but the liberty."  Any restriction on the right, including the prohibition of concealed carry was a violation of the right.&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, 1 Ga. 243 at 247-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast the court in ''Reid'' upheld a similar ban on concealed carry.  The Alabama constitution read, "that every citizen has a right to bear arms in defence of himself and the State."  The ''Reid'' court held that the law "to suppress the evil practice of carrying weapons secretly," did not violate the Alabama constitution.  While the legislature could not prevent the carrying of arms, it did retain the right "to enact laws in regard to the manner in which arms shall be borne."  Because the restriction on concealed carry was not a prohibition on the right, it was within the ambit of the legislature to restrict concealed carry.&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, 1 Ga. 243 at 248-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental rights===
The ''Nunn'' court recognized that ''Reid'' and ''Bliss'' were applying clauses in state constitutions.  But, their decisions were relevant to Georgia because the state constitutional protection of the right to keep and bear arms was not a newly given right, but was a recitation of an already existent right. 

{{quote|It is true, that these adjudications are all made on clauses in the State Constitutions; but these instruments confer no new rights on the people which did not belong to them before. When, I would ask, did any legislative body in the Union have the right to deny to its citizens the privilege of keeping and bearing arms in defence of themselves and their country?&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, 1 Ga. 243 at 249.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The court held that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protected the rights of Georgia citizens because free people have the right to self-defense.  The fact that Georgia did not have a constitutional amendment did not empower the Georgia legislature to infringe on the right.  The right is fundamental, and no free society could exist where the right was prohibited.&lt;ref name="Doherty2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Brian|title=Gun Control on Trial: Inside the Supreme Court Battle Over the Second Amendment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otH3onCr37IC|accessdate=7 March 2013|year=2008|publisher=Cato Institute|isbn=9781933995250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But admitting all this, does it follow that because the people refused to delegate to the general government the power to take from them the right to keep and bear arms, that they designed to rest it in the State governments? Is this a right reserved to the States or to themselves?  Is it not an unalienable right, which lies at the bottom of every free government? We do not believe that, because the people withheld this arbitrary power of disfranchisement from Congress, they ever intended to confer it on the local legislatures. This right is too dear to be confided to a republican legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, 1 Ga. 243 at 250.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
The court also held that the whole people, not just [[Militia#Nineteenth Century 2|militia]] were afforded the right to keep and bear arms.  And the type of arms was not restricted only to those borne by the militia but arms of every type and description.

{{quote|The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of the free State.&lt;ref name="Nunn, 1 Ga. 243 at 251"&gt;Nunn, 1 Ga. 243 at 251.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The court's concept of rights meant that other portions of the Bill of Rights would also apply to the States.  For example, the court explained that the right to peaceably assemble, protected under the First Amendment, was applicable to both the national and state governments.  The court also cited to the New York case of ''People vs. Goodwin'', 18 John. Rep. 200 (N.Y.Sup. 1820) which applied Fifth Amendment double jeopardy prohibitions to New York state court operations.  The court explained how to determine which constitutional provisions apply to the state and which applied only the federal government; the relevant question is whether the concepts in the constitution were confined only to the national government or if they could be extended to the states as well.  Citing ''Goodwin'':

{{quote|These general and comprehensive expressions extend the provisions of the constitution of the United States to every article which is not confined, by the subject matter, to the national government, and is equally applicable to the states.}}

==Modern significance==
The ''Nunn'' court's decision has continuing relevance to the ongoing debate over gun rights.  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in its ruling in ''[[Heller v. District of Columbia]]'' said ''Nunn'', "...perfectly captured the way in which the operative clause of the Second amendment furthered the purpose announced in the prefatory clause...."&lt;ref name="Ph.D.2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ph.D.|first=Gregg Lee Carter|title=Guns in American Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeGJH48PT0kC|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=2012-05-04|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313386718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heller"/&gt;  The ''Nunn'' court concept of fundamental rights was relevant to determine whether or not the Second Amendment is a restriction only on the federal government or whether the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right that cannot be infringed by the state governments

{{Behavioural influences}}
'''Obedience''', in human behavior, is a form of "[[social influence]] in which a person yields to explicit instructions or orders from an authority figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Colman | first = Andrew | title = A Dictionary of Psychology | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 0199534063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obedience is generally distinguished from [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]], which is behavior influenced by peers, and from [[conformity]], which is behavior intended to match that of the majority.  Depending on context, obedience can be seen as [[morality|moral]], [[immorality|immoral]], or [[amorality|amoral]].

Humans have been shown to be obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate [[authority]] figures, as shown by the [[Milgram experiment]] in the 1960s, which was carried out by Stanley Milgram to find out how the [[Nazis]] managed to get ordinary people to take part in the mass murders of the [[Holocaust]]. The experiment showed that obedience to authority was the norm, not the exception. Regarding obedience, Milgram said that "Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to. Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others."&lt;ref name=Milgram2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milgram|first=S.|title=Behavioral study of obedience|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1963|volume=67|pages=371–378|doi=10.1037/h0040525|pmid=14049516}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion was reached in the [[Stanford prison experiment]].

==Experimental studies==

=== Classical methods and results ===
Although other fields have studied obedience, social psychology has been primarily responsible for the advancement of research on obedience. It has been studied experimentally in several different ways.

====Milgram's experiment====
In one classical study, Stanley Milgram (as part of the [[Milgram experiment]]) created a highly controversial yet often replicated study. Like many other experiments in psychology, Milgram's setup involved [[deception]] of the participants. In the experiment, subjects were told they were going to take part in a study of the effects of punishment on learning.  In reality, the experiment focuses on people's willingness to obey malevolent authority. Each subject served as a teacher of associations between arbitrary pairs of words.  After meeting the "teacher" at the beginning of the experiment, the "learner" (an accomplice of the experimenter) sat in another room and could be heard, but not seen.  Teachers were told to give the "learner" electric shocks of increasing severity for each wrong answer. If subjects questioned the procedure, the "researcher" (again, an accomplice of Milgram) would encourage them to continue.  Subjects were told to ignore the agonized screams of the learner, his desire to be untied and stop the experiment, and his pleas that his life was at risk and that he suffered from a heart condition.  The experiment, the "researcher" insisted, had to go on. The [[dependent variable]] in this experiment was the voltage amount of shocks administered.&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt;

====Zimbardo's experiment====
The other classical study on obedience was conducted at [[Stanford University]] during the 1970s. [[Phillip Zimbardo]] was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment. In the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]], college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of "social forces" on participants behavior.&lt;ref name=Zimbardo1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haney|first=C|author2=Banks, C. |author3=Zimbardo, P. |title=Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison|journal=International Journal of Criminology and Penology|year=1973|volume=1|pages=69–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions, here using [[random assignment]] half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners. The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing "a psychological state of imprisonment".&lt;ref name=Zimbardo1/&gt;

====Results====
The Milgram study found that most participants would obey orders even when obedience posed severe harm to others.  With encouragement from a perceived authority figure, about two-thirds of the participants were willing to administer the highest level of shock to the learner. This result was surprising to Milgram because he thought that "subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will".&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt; Milgram attempted to explain how ordinary people were capable of performing potentially lethal acts against other human beings by suggesting that participants may have entered into an agentic state, where they allowed the authority figure to take responsibility for their own actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html|title=Milgram Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbardo obtained similar results as the guards in the study obeyed orders and turned aggressive. Prisoners likewise were hostile to and resented their guards. The cruelty of the "guards" and the consequent stress of the "prisoners," forced Zimbardo to terminate the experiment prematurely, after 6 days.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo1" /&gt;

=== Modern methods and results ===
The previous two studies greatly influenced how modern psychologists think about obedience. Milgram's study in particular generated a large response from the psychology community. In a modern study, Jerry Burger replicated Milgram's method with a few alterations. Burger's method was identical to Milgram's except when the shocks reached 150 volts, participants decided whether or not they wanted to continue and then the experiment ended (base condition). To ensure the safety of the participants, Burger added a two-step screening process; this was to rule out any participants that may react negatively to the experiment. In the modeled refusal condition, two confederates were used, where one confederate acted as the learner and the other was the teacher. The teacher stopped after going up to 90 volts, and the participant was asked to continue where the confederate left off.  This methodology was considered more ethical because many of the adverse psychological effects seen in previous studies' participants occurred after moving past 150 volts. Additionally, since Milgram's study only used men, Burger tried to determine if there were differences between genders in his study and randomly assigned equal numbers of men and women to the experimental conditions.&lt;ref name=Burger1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burger|first=Jerry|title=Replicating Milgram: Would people still obey today?|journal=American Psychologist|year=2009|volume=64|pages=1–11|doi=10.1037/a0010932|pmid=19209958|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using data from his previous study, Burger probed participant's thoughts about obedience. Participants' comments from the previous study were coded for the number of times they mentioned "personal responsibility and the learner's well being".&lt;ref name=Burger2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burger|first=Jerry |author2=Girgis, Z. |author3=Manning, C.|title=In their own words: Explaining obedience to authority through an examination of participants' comments|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|year=2011|volume=2|pages=460–466|doi=10.1177/1948550610397632|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of prods the participants used in the first experiment were also measured.

Another study that used a partial replication of Milgram's work changed the experimental setting. In one of the Utrecht University studies on obedience, participants were instructed to make a confederate who was taking an employment test feel uncomfortable. Participants were told to make all of the instructed stress remarks to the confederate that ultimately made him fail in the experimental condition, but in the control condition they were not told to make stressful remarks. The dependent measurements were whether or not the participant made all of the stress remarks (measuring absolute obedience) and the number of stress remarks (relative obedience).&lt;ref name=Utrecht&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meeus|first=Wim|author2=Quinten Raaijmakers |title=Administrative obedience: Carrying out orders to use psychological-administrative violence|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1986|volume=16|pages=311–324|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420160402|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Utrecht studies, another study used the stress remarks method to see how long participants would obey authority. The dependent measures for this experiment were the number of stress remarks made and a separate measure of personality designed to measure individual differences.&lt;ref name=Bocchiaro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bocchiaro|first=Piero|author2=Zimbardo, P. |title=Defying unjust authority: An exploratory study|journal=Current Psychology|year=2010|volume=29|pages=155–170|doi=10.1007/s12144-010-9080-z|pmid=20461226|issue=2|pmc=2866362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Results====
Burger's first study had results similar to the ones found in Milgram's previous study. The rates of obedience were very similar to those found in the Milgram study, showing that participants' tendency to obey has not declined over time. Additionally, Burger found that both genders exhibited similar behavior, suggesting that obedience will occur in participants independent of gender.
In Burger's follow-up study, he found that participants that worried about the well being of the learner were more hesitant to continue the study. He also found that the more the experimenter prodded the participant to continue, the more likely they were to stop the experiment.
The Utrecht University study also replicated Milgram's results. They found that although participants indicated they did not enjoy the task, over 90% of them completed the experiment.&lt;ref name=Utrecht /&gt;
The Bocchiaro and Zimbardo study had similar levels of obedience compared to the Milgram and Utrecht studies. They also found that participants would either stop the experiment at the first sign of the learner's pleas or would continue until the end of the experiment (called "the foot in the door scenario").&lt;ref name=Bocchiaro /&gt;
In addition to the above studies, additional research using participants from different cultures (including Spain,&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miranda|first=F.|author2=Caballero, B., Gomez, &amp; Zamorano M.|title=Obediencia a la autoridad [Obedience to Authority]|journal=Psiquis|year=1981|volume=2|pages=212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia,&lt;ref name=Kilham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kilham|first=W.|author2=Mann, L. |title=The level of destructive obedience as a function of transmitter and executant roles in the Milgram obedience paradigm|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|volume=29|pages=696–702|doi=10.1037/h0036636|pmid=4833430|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan)&lt;ref name=Shanab&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shanab|first=M.|author2=Yahka, K. |title=A cross-cultural study of obedience|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|year=1978|volume=11|pages=530–536}}&lt;/ref&gt; also found participants to be obedient.

===Implications===
One of the major assumptions of obedience research is that the effect is caused only by the experimental conditions, and [[Thomas Blass]]' research contests this point, as in some cases participant factors involving personality could potentially influence the results.&lt;ref name=Blass1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blass|first=T|title=Understanding behavior in the Milgram obedience experiment: The role of personality, situations and their interactions|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=60|pages=398–413|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.3.398|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In one of Blass' reviews on obedience, he found that participant's personalities can impact how they respond to authority,&lt;ref name="Blass1"/&gt; as people that were high in authoritarian submission were more likely to obey.&lt;ref name=Elms&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elms|first=A.|author2=Milgram, S. |title=Personality characteristics associated with obedience and defiance to authoritative command|journal=Journal of Experimental Research in Personality|year=1966|volume=1966|pages=282–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; He replicated this finding in his own research, as in one of his experiments, he found that when watching portions of the original Milgram studies on film, participants placed less responsibility on those punishing the learner when they scored high on measures of authoritarianism.&lt;ref name=Blass2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blass|first=T.|title=Right-wing authoritarianism and role as predictors of attributions about obedience to authority|journal=Journal of Personality and Individual Differences|year=1995|volume=1|pages=99–100|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(95)00004-P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to personality factors, participants who are resistant to obeying authority had high levels of [[social intelligence]].&lt;ref name=Burley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burley|first=P|author2=McGuinnes, J. |title=Effects of social intelligence on the Milgram paradigm|journal=Psychological Reports|year=1977|volume=40|pages=767–770|doi=10.2466/pr0.1977.40.3.767|pmid=866515|issue=3 Pt 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other research==
Obedience can also be studied outside of the Milgram paradigm in fields such as economics or political science. One economics study that compared obedience to a tax authority in the lab versus at home found that participants were much more likely to pay participation tax when confronted in the lab.&lt;ref name=Cadsby&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cadsby|first=B.|author2=Maynes, E. |author3=Trivedi, V. |title=Tax compliance and obedience to authority at home and in the lab: A new experimental approach|journal=Experimental Economics|year=2006|volume=9|pages=343–359|doi=10.1007/s10683-006-7053-8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding implies that even outside of experimental settings, people will forgo potential financial gain to obey authority.

Another study involving political science measured public opinion before and after a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case debating whether or not states can legalize physician assisted suicide. They found that participants' tendency to obey authorities was not as important to public opinion polling numbers as religious and moral beliefs.&lt;ref name=Skitka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.|author2=Bauman, C. |author3=Lytle, B. |title=Limits of legitimacy: Moral and religious convictions as constraints on deference to authority|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=97|pages=567–578|doi=10.1037/a0015998|pmid=19785478|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although prior research has demonstrated that the tendency to obey persists across settings, this finding suggests that at personal factors like religion and morality can limit how much people obey authority.

==Other experiments==

===The Hofling hospital experiment===
{{main|Hofling hospital experiment}}
Both the Milgram and Stanford experiments were conducted in research settings. In 1966, psychiatrist Charles K. Hofling published the results of a [[field experiment]] on obedience in the nurse–physician relationship in its natural hospital setting. Nurses, unaware they were taking part in an experiment, were ordered by unknown doctors to administer dangerous doses of a (fictional) drug to their patients. Although several hospital rules disallowed administering the drug under the circumstances, 21 out of the 22 nurses would have given the patient an overdose.&lt;ref name="hofling_hospital"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofling | first1 = C.K. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1966 | title = An Experimental Study of Nurse-Physician Relationships | doi = 10.1097/00005053-196608000-00008 | journal = Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 141 | issue = | pages = 171–80 | pmid = 5957275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural attitudes==
[[File:4242 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Capitello 28 - Obediencia Dno exireo - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 30-Jul-2008.jpg|thumb|[[Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]]: capital featuring '''Virtues and vices''' - ''Obediencia D&lt;omi&gt;no exireo'' (Obedience to God).]]

Many traditional cultures regard obedience as a [[virtue]]; historically, societies have expected children to obey their elders (compare [[patriarchy]], slaves their owners, serfs their lords in [[feudal society]], lords their king, and everyone God. Even long after [[slavery]] ended in the United States, the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black codes]] required black people to obey and submit to whites, on pain of [[lynching]]. Compare the religious ideal of [[Surrender (religion)|surrender]] and its importance in Islam (the word ''Islam'' can literally mean "surrender").&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Christian [[wedding]]s, obedience was formally included along with [[honor]] and [[love]] as part of a conventional bride's (but not the bridegroom's) [[wedding vow]]. This came under attack with [[women's suffrage]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the [[feminist]] movement. {{As of | 2014}} the inclusion of a promise to obey in [[marriage vows]] has become optional in some [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s.

==Obedience training of human beings==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
{{main|Socialization|Military training}}
Some animals can easily be trained to be obedient by employing [[operant conditioning]], for example [[obedience school]]s exist to condition [[dog]]s to obey the orders of human owners.

Learning to obey adult rules is a major part of the [[socialization]] process in childhood, and many techniques are used by adults to modify the behavior of children. Additionally, extensive training is given in armies to make soldiers capable of obeying orders in situations where an untrained person would not be willing to follow orders. Soldiers are initially ordered to do seemingly trivial things, such as picking up the sergeant's hat off the floor, marching in just the right position, or marching and standing in formation. The orders gradually become more demanding, until an order to the soldiers to place themselves into the midst of gunfire gets an instinctively obedient response.

==Factors affecting obedience==

===Embodiment of prestige or power===
[[Image:Russian paratroopers in Kazakhstan.jpg|thumb|right|Obedience occurs in several situations; most often referred to is the obedience of soldiers to a superior officer.]]
When the Milgram experimenters were interviewing potential volunteers, the participant selection process itself revealed several factors that affected obedience, outside of the actual experiment.

Interviews for eligibility were conducted in an abandoned complex in [[Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berstein 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berstein|first=D.A.|title=Psychology|year=1988|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the dilapidated state of the building, the researchers found that the presence of a Yale professor as stipulated in the advertisement affected the number of people who obeyed. This was not further researched to test obedience without a Yale professor because Milgram had not intentionally staged the interviews to discover factors that affected obedience.&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt;  A similar conclusion was reached in the [[Stanford prison experiment]].&lt;ref name="Berstein 1"/&gt;

In the actual experiment, [[Reputation|prestige]] or the appearance of power was a direct factor in obedience—particularly the presence of men dressed in gray [[white coat|laboratory coats]], which gave the impression of scholarship and achievement and was thought to be the main reason why people complied with administering what they thought was a painful or dangerous shock.&lt;ref name="Milgram2"/&gt;  A similar conclusion was reached in the [[Stanford prison experiment]].

Raj Persaud, in an article in the BMJ,&lt;ref name="persaud"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Persaud | first1 = Raj | year = 2005 | title = The Man Who Shocked the World: The Life and Legacy of Stanley Milgraml | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 331 | issue = | page = 356 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7512.356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; comments on Milgram's attention to detail in his experiment:
{{quote|The research was also conducted with amazing verve and subtlety—for example, Milgram ensured that the "experimenter" wear a grey lab coat rather than a white one, precisely because he did not want subjects to think that the "experimenter" was a medical doctor and thereby limit the implications of his findings to the power of physician authority.}}

Despite the fact that prestige is often thought of as a separate factor, it is, in fact, merely a subset of power as a factor. Thus, the prestige conveyed by a Yale professor in a laboratory coat is only a manifestation of the experience and status associated with it and/or the social status afforded by such an image.

=== Agentic state and other factors ===
According to Milgram, "the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person's wishes, and he therefore no longer sees himself as responsible for his actions. Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person, all of the essential features of obedience follow." Thus, "the major problem for the subject is to recapture control of his own regnant processes once he has committed them to the purposes of the experimenter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Obedience to Authority|last=Milgram|first=Stanley|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1974|isbn=|location=New York|pages=xii, xiii.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this hypothetical agentic state, Milgram proposed the existence of other factors accounting for the subject's obedience: politeness, awkwardness of withdrawal, absorption in the technical aspects of the task, the tendency to attribute impersonal quality to forces that are essentially human, a belief that the experiment served a desirable end, the sequential nature of the action, and anxiety.

=== Belief perseverance ===
Another explanation of Milgram's results invokes [[belief perseverance]] as the underlying cause. What "people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent, even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent. Hence, the underlying cause for the subjects' striking conduct could well be conceptual, and not the alleged 'capacity of man to abandon his humanity ... as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures."'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1990|title=A cognitive reinterpretation of Stanley Milgram's observations on obedience to authority|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232510613_A_Cognitive_Reinterpretation_of_Stanley_Milgram's_Observations_on_Obedience_to_Authority|journal=American Psychologist|volume=45|pages=1384–1385|via=|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.45.12.1384 | last1 = Nissani | first1 = Moti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Opinio juris sive necessitatis''''' ("an opinion of law or necessity") or simply '''''opinio juris''''' ("an opinion of law") is the belief that an [[Action (philosophy)|action]] was carried out as a legal [[obligation]]. This is in contrast to an action resulting from [[Cognition|cognitive]] reaction or behaviors habitual to an individual.  This term is frequently used in legal proceedings such as a defense for a case.

''Opinio juris'' is the subjective element of custom as a source of law, both [[custom (law)|domestic]] and [[customary international law|international]], as it refers to beliefs. The other element is state practice, which is more objective as it is readily discernible. To qualify as state practice, the acts must be consistent and general international practice.

== State applications ==
A situation where ''opinio juris'' would be feasible is a case concerning [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]].  A condition must be met where the usage of force is limited to the situation at hand. The act of striking an attacker may be done with legal justification; however, legal territory limits the acceptability of such a claim. Even in this case, the usage of force must be acceptable to the conditions of the environment, the attacker, and the physical conditions of the people involved, as well as any weapons or tools used.

== International applications ==
In [[international law]], ''opinio juris'' is the subjective element used to judge whether the practice of a state is due to a belief that it is legally obliged to do a particular act.&lt;ref name="Bederman"&gt;Bederman, David J., ''International Law Frameworks'' (New York, New York: Foundation Press, 2001) at 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; When opinio juris exists and is consistent with nearly all state practice, customary international law emerges.  Opinio juris essentially means that states must act in compliance with the norm not merely out of convenience, habit, coincidence, or political expediency, but rather out of a sense of legal obligation.&lt;ref&gt;The full phrase—opinio juris sive necessitatis—is Latin for “opinion (or belief) about whether law or necessity.”  In other words, the requirement of opinio juris means that the court should decide whether the state practice has arisen due to a belief that the practice was legally required, or whether it has merely acted out of necessity or convenience.  &lt;/ref&gt; [1]  Article 38(1)(b) of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]] accepts "international custom" as a source of law, but only where this custom is 1) “evidence of a general practice,” (the objective component)  (2) "accepted as law." (the opinio juris or subjective component)&lt;ref&gt;David Harris, Cases and Materials on International Law, Seventh Edition, Sweet and Maxwell Publishers, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for example, while it may be observed that heads of state virtually always shake hands when they first meet, it is highly unlikely that they do so because they believe that a rule of international law requires it.  On the other hand, a state would almost certainly expect some form of legal repercussions if it were to prosecute a foreign ambassador without the consent of his or her home state, and in this sense opinio juris does exist for the international law rule of [[diplomatic immunity]].

Because opinio juris refers to the psychological state of the state actor—asking why the state behaved as it did—it can be difficult to identify and to prove.  In practice, a variety of sources tend to be used to demonstrate the existence of opinio juris, including evidence such as diplomatic correspondence, press releases and other government statements of policy, opinions of legal advisers, official manuals on legal questions, legislation, national and international judicial decisions, legal briefs endorsed by the state, a pattern of treaties ratified by the state that all include the same obligation(s), resolutions and declarations by the United Nations, and other sources.  In [[the Paquete Habana]] case (decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1900 on the question of whether small coastal fishing boats are immune from capture during wartime under customary international law), evidence of opinio juris included medieval English royal ordinances, agreements between European nations, orders issued to the [[U.S. Navy]] in earlier conflicts, and the opinions of legal treatise writers.   Finally, the context, circumstances, and manner in which the state practice is carried out can also be used to infer the existence of opinio juris.  As the ICJ stated in the [[North Sea Continental Shelf cases]] of 1969, "Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it."&lt;ref&gt;North Sea Continental Shelf, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, pp. 3, 45, para. 77.  {{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/51/5535.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812032526/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/51/5535.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, a state's motives can change over time, and that it is not necessary that opinio juris be a significant impetus for each instance of action.  As Judge Lachs wrote in a dissenting opinion in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, "At successive stages in the development of the [customary] rule the motives which have prompted States to accept it have varied from case to case. It could not be otherwise. At all events, to postulate that all States, even those which initiate a given practice, believe themselves to be acting under a legal obligation is to resort to a fiction, and in fact to deny the possibility of developing such rules."&lt;ref&gt;North Sea Continental Shelf, 1969 I.C.J. 4, 232-33 (Feb. 20) (dissenting opinion of Judge Lachs). &lt;/ref&gt;

As difficult as it can be to prove why an actor did act in a certain way, it is exponentially more difficult to prove why it did not act.  For this reason, the necessity of demonstrating that a behavior was prompted by a sense of legal obligation makes it particularly difficult for customary international law to develop around the prohibition of a practice.  One important case in the development of modern customary international law theory is the [[Lotus case]], in which [[France]] attempted to protest [[Turkey]]'s assertion of criminal jurisdiction over a French citizen for acts committed on the high seas (outside of Turkey's territory).  France presented a number of historical examples to demonstrate that the state of nationality or the state whose flag the ship had flown had exclusive jurisdiction in cases such as this.  However, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] (a precursor to the ICJ) declared that the evidence showed merely that "States had often, in practice, abstained from instituting criminal proceedings, and not that they recognized themselves as being obliged to do so; for only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom."&lt;ref&gt;S.S. Lotus Case, 1927 P.C.I.J. (Ser. A) No. 10 (Fr. v. Tur.).&lt;/ref&gt;  This reasoning was cited approvingly in the [[North Sea Continental Shelf cases]], which similarly declined to find the existence of customary law regarding the proper method to delimit territorial claims to the continental shelf extending from the coastline of states bordering the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;North Sea Continental Shelf, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, pp. 3, 45, para. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ICJ also declined to find evidence of customary international law in an opinion on the legality of the use or threat of nuclear weapons, despite what some argued to be uniform state practice.  As in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, it found that the mere fact that no state had used nuclear weapons against another state since World War II did not reflect opinio juris.  Some states had pointed out that a series of U.N. resolutions had been issued "that deal with nuclear weapons and that affirm, with consistent regularity, the illegality of nuclear weapons," and argued that this signified “the existence of a rule of international customary law which prohibits recourse to those weapons.”&lt;ref&gt;"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons" - Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 - General List No. 95 (1995-1998), par. 68.  {{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/95/7494.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605000057/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/95/7494.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the ICJ wrote that states possessing nuclear weapons had almost always objected to these resolutions, which strongly suggests that those states did not believe that a customary law prohibiting their use existed.  Moreover, it wrote that the non-use of nuclear weapons could actually provide evidence of their "use" as a deterrent force.&lt;ref&gt;"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons" - Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 - General List No. 95 (1995-1998), par. 67.  {{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/95/7494.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605000057/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/95/7494.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

This logical framework makes sense for existing norms of customary international law, but it becomes problematic in the context of new or emerging customary rules.  If a practice is not currently governed by customary international law, then it is illogical to inquire into a state's beliefs about the legality of engaging in or abstaining from that practice, i.e., to ask whether it believed that its practice was in compliance with a law that does not yet exist.  This paradox may be resolved to some extent by the idea of "crystallization" of customary international law, in which practice and legal obligation evolve jointly and eventually ripen into law.  Under one model, this process occurs in three stages: first, some States engage in a given practice for reasons other than a sense of legal obligation (e.g. political expediency, economic gain, courtesy, etc.); next, States reinforce the practice by engaging in it or making claims based upon it, creating loops of reciprocity and reliance based on expectations that the practice will continue; finally, as these relationships expand in number and complexity, they eventually harden into a general rule.  In this final stage, as more States become aware of the conduct and actively participate or at least passively acquiesce to the practice, the States' actions begin to be undergirded by a belief that they are complying with an emerging customary rule.

'''Charles "Pete" Orr''' (July 29, 1956 – November 18, 2002) was an American [[stock car racing|stock car]] racing driver.

In 1995, having left local competition in an attempt to make it at the top levels of the sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orr races to DeSoto win|date=April 17, 1995|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|page=5C|accessdate=2012-06-15|location=Sarasota, FL|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19950417&amp;id=pLsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=H78EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5636,3168741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orr made his debut in NASCAR national touring competition, driving for [[David Ridling]] in the [[Xfinity Series|Busch Grand National Series]].&lt;ref name="road"&gt;{{cite news|title=Orr takes long road to Grand National|last=Zizzo|first=Mike|date=July 27, 1995|work=Orlando Sentinel|page=D10|accessdate=2012-06-15|location=Orlando, FL|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-07-27/sports/9507270443_1_pete-orr-ridling-hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orr was 39; he had promised his wife he would retire if he hadn't reached the Busch Series level by age 40.&lt;ref name="road"/&gt; Driving the No. 88 Chevrolet with sponsorship from [[Farmer's Choice Fertilizer]], he ran two races in the 1995 season, at [[Darlington Raceway]] and [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]], with a best finish of 29th; he failed to qualify for the two final races of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/drivdet/orrpe01/1995/B|title=Pete Orr – 1995 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series Results|work=Racing-Reference|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remaining with Ridling's team for the 1996 season, Orr planned full-time in the Busch Series, declaring his intention to compete for [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] honors; in the season-opening [[Goody's 300]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]], Orr qualified tenth for the series' biggest race of the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Purvis is making splash at Daytona|date=February 17, 1996|work=[[The Gadsden Times]]|page=B5|accessdate=2012-06-15|location=Gadsden, AL|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19960217&amp;id=JbgfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q9cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3677,1593772}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was involved in an accident, finishing 40th of 46 cars and completing only 50 laps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Busch rookie Orr banged up, finishes 40th|last=Williams|first=Charlean|date=February 18, 1996|work=Orlando Sentinel|page=S2|accessdate=2012-06-15|location=Orlando, FL|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-02-18/features/9602170406_1_busch-waltrip-wallace-will-start}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orr failed to qualify three times over the next six races, with his best finish in the three races which he qualified for being 34th, at [[Richmond International Raceway]] in the third race of the season, and [[Bristol International Raceway]] in the seventh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/drivdet/orrpe01/1996/B|title=Pete Orr – 1996 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series Results|work=Racing-Reference|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol's [[Goody's Headache Powder 250]] would be Orr's final race in NASCAR's higher levels; before the race the following week at [[Hickory Motor Speedway]], Ridling released him from the team, replacing him with [[Kevin Lepage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lepage gets a big break, deservedly so|last=Oakes|first=Kalle|work=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun-Journal]]|page=1C|accessdate=2012-06-15|location=Lewiston, ME|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&amp;dat=19960503&amp;id=2VIpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zmoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4151,424680}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would go on to win at the season's final race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-11-04/news/9611040060_1_randy-lajoie-david-hutto-kevin-lepage|title=Lepage Wins A Safe Jiffy Lube|last=Biebrich|first=Richard Jr.|date=November 4, 1996|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|accessdate=2012-06-15|location=Fort Lauderdale, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phulkari''' ({{lang-pa|ਫੁਲਕਾਰੀ}}) embroidery technique from the [[Punjab region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]], literally means ''flower work'', which was at one time used as the word for embroidery, but in time the word “Phulkari” became restricted to embroidered shawls and head scarfs.  Simple and sparsely embroidered ''odini'' (head scarfs), dupatta and shawls, made for everyday use, are called ''Phulkaris'', whereas garments that cover the entire body, made for special and [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] occasions like weddings and birth of a son, fully covered fabric is called  ''Baghs'' ("garden") and scattered work on the fabric is called "adha bagh" (half garden). This whole work is done with white or yellow silk floss on cotton khaddarh and starts from the center on the fabric called "chashm-e-bulbul" and spreads to the whole fabric.

==Etymology==
The word ''phul'' means flower and ''kari'' means craft, thus its name, literally means floral work or floral craft.

== Origin ==
[[File:Phulkari from Punjab, India, 20th century, khadi, silk, plain weave, embroidery, Honolulu Museum of Art.JPG|thumb|Phulkari from Punjab, India, 20th century]]
[[File:Head Cloth (Phulkari) LACMA M.64.24.1.jpg|thumb|left|Head Cloth (Phulkari) 19th century Punjab LACMA M.64.24.1]]

Punjab is known for its Phulkaris. The [[embroidery]] is done with floss silk thread on coarse hand woven cotton fabric. Geometrical patterns are usually embroidered on the Phulkaris.      
Phulkaris and Baghs were worn by women all over [[Punjab region|Punjab]] during marriage festivals and other joyous occasions.  They were embroidered by the women for their own use and use of other family members and were not for sale in the market.  Thus, it was purely a domestic [[art]] which not only satisfied their inner urge for creation but brought colour into day-to-day life.  In a way, it was true [[folk art]].  Custom had grown to give Phulkaris and Baghs to brides at the time of marriages.  The exquisite embroidery for Baghs are known to have been made in the districts of [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mr83SBGPTvEC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=til+patra+phulkari&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iIg8HNq2kb&amp;sig=Won2GHkQzLrsRTlu4ARe2ef_4zY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCGoVChMIpNX04L-4xwIVgdYaCh3R5geK#v=onepage&amp;q=til%20patra%20phulkari&amp;f=false Sukaadas (1992) Fabric Art: Heritage of India]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peshawar]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Sialkot]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Jhelum]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Rawalpindi]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Multan]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Amritsar]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Jalandhar]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Ambala]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Ludhiana]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Nabha]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Jind]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Faridkot, Punjab|Faridkot]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; [[Kapurthala]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  and [[Chakwal]] of the [[Punjab region]]. Bagh and phulkari embroidery has influenced the embroidery of [[Gujarat]] known as 'heer bharat' in its use of geometrical motifs and stitchery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=heer+bharat+gujarat+phulkari&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oAeVU2p7ms&amp;sig=d2AwI5X2kZMc3WX0UgT9luwHX9I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMIm6fsx8S4xwIVytOACh3_nQSC#v=onepage&amp;q=heer%20bharat%20gujarat%20phulkari&amp;f=false Naik, Shailaja D.  (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feel it came from [[Central Asia]] along with [[Jat]] tribes who migrated to [[India]] and settled in Punjab, [[Haryana]] and [[Gujarat]].  There is reference of Phulkari in [[Vedas]], [[Mahabharat]], [[Guru Granth Sahib]] and folk songs of Punjab. In its present form, phulkari embroidery has been popular since the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indian-embroidery.com/phulkari-embroidery.html Phulkari embroidery]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characteristics of Phulkari embroidery are use of darn stitch on the wrong side of coarse [[cotton]] cloth with coloured silken thread. Punjabi women created innumerable alluring and interesting designs and patterns by their skilful manipulation of the darn stitch.  The base [[khadi|khaddar cloth]] used in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Western Punjab]] is finer from those of [[Doaba|Central Punjab]].  Black/blue are not preferred in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Western Punjab]], whereas white is not used in [[East Punjab]]. In [[West Punjab]], 2 or 3 pieces of cloth are first folded and joined together.  In [[East Punjab]], they are joined together first and then embroidered.

In Phulkari embroidery ornaments the cloth, whereas in ''Bagh'', it entirely covers the garment so that the base cloth is not visible.&lt;ref name=tri&gt;{{cite news |title=SPIRIT OF ENTERPRISE: Crafting an artistic future |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20021201/herworld.htm#4 |publisher=The Tribune |date=December 1, 2002 |accessdate=Apr 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The end portion of [[pallav]] of Phulkari have separate panels of exquisite workmanship of striking design.

The most favoured colour is red and its shades, because Bagh and Phulkari are used during marriage and other festivals.  Red is also considered auspicious by Punjabi Hindus and Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Hitkari (1980) Phulkari: The Folk Art of Punjab.

White was used in Bagh by elderly ladies.  Silk thread in strands came from [[Kashmir]], [[Afghanistan]] and Bengal. The best quality [[silk]] came from [[China]].

No [[religion|religious]] subject or [[Durbar (court)|darbar]] scenes were embroidered. Phulkari encompassed life in the villages.  Creative ability of Punjabi women has produced innumerable and intricate [[geometrical]] patterns.  However, most [[Motif (art)|motif]]s were taken from everyday life. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] stalk with ears are a common motif.

==Types==

===Chope and subhar===
The two styles of chope and subhar are worn by brides. The chope is embroidered on both sides of the cloth. [[File:Antique Museum Quality Chope Phulkari courtesy the Wovensouls collection, Singapore.jpg|thumb|Antique Chope Phulkari created using the Holbein stitch that results in the same visual on the front and the back of the textile. Courtesy the Wovensouls collection]]

Only the borders and the four edges of the cloth are embroidered in fine embroidery.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Mohinder Singh Randhawa. (1960) Punjab: Itihas, Kala, Sahit, te Sabiachar aad.Bhasha Vibhag, Punjab, Patiala.&lt;/ref&gt; The subhar has a central motif and four motifs on the corners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=til+patra+phulkari&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oAeVU2o4ns&amp;sig=wuxKF0UKD0NIi4j13lZTb6LVE1M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwB2oVChMIpNX04L-4xwIVgdYaCh3R5geK#v=onepage&amp;q=til%20patra%20phulkari&amp;f=false Naik, Shailaja D.  (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Til patra===
The til (sesame) patra has decorative embroidery which is spread out as if spreading sesame seeds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The term til patra means 'the sprinkling of seeds'.&lt;ref&gt;Rajinder Kaur, Ila Gupta. American International Journal of Research in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. Phulkari and Bagh folk art of Punjab: a study of changing designs from traditional to contemporary time [http://iasir.net/AIJRHASSpapers/AIJRHASS14-118.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neelak===
The neelak phulkari is made of a black or red background with yellow or bright red embroidery. The colour of the phulkari is mixed with metals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Ghunghat bagh===
Originating in [[Rawalpindi]], the ghunghat bagh is heavily embroidered around the centre on the edge to be worn over the head. The embroidered centre is then pulled over the face so as to form an embroidered veil.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Chhamaas===
The chhaamas phulkari hails from [[Rohtak]], [[Gurgaon]], [[Hisar (city)|Hissar]] and Delhi. The chaamas phulkari incorporates mirrors which are sewn into the cloth with yellow, grey or blue thread.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Phulkari of south and southwestern Punjab region===
The phulkari of south and southwestern [[Punjab region]], has wide edges upon which designs of animals and birds are embroidered. As is the case of the chaup, the edges are embroidered on both sides of the cloth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; South and southwestern [[Punjab region]] includes the south [[Punjab, India]], south and south west of [[Punjab, Pakistan]].

===Senchi phulkari===
The senchi phulkari is popular in and around [[Ferozepur]]. The senchi phulkai incorporates designs of birds, jewellery such as bracelets, earrings, rings and necklaces.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Revival and modern applications==
Traditionally, phulkari garments were part of a girl's wedding [[dowry|trousseau]], its motifs expressive of her emotions and the number of phulkari pieces defined the status of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everyone's talking about: Phulkari|url=http://www.vogue.in/content/everyones-talking-about-phulkari |date=15 Apr 2013 |publisher=Vogue India |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, government has been working towards promotion of phulkari embroidery, by organizing special training programs, fairs, and exhibitions.&lt;ref name=tri/&gt; Since most of women artisan creating phulkari are in the unorganized sector or work through agents, they do not make much money compared to an actual market price of their product, to avoid this lacuna Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) has formed women self-help groups and cooperatives to sell directly and make more profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Phulkari workers get peanuts |url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/08/03/stories/2008080354400500.htm |publisher=The Hindu |date=Aug 3, 2008 |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts]] (IGNCA) acquired a collection of selected phulkari for its archives in 1994.&lt;ref name=exp&gt;{{cite news |title=Phulkari, Then and Now|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/phulkari-then-and-now/1104457/ |publisher=Indian Express |date=Apr 19, 2013  |accessdate=Apr 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern fashion designers are incorporating this embroidery into their garments, and its use has spread beyond ''[[salwar kameez]]'' and ''[[dupatta]]'' to objects and garments as varied, as jackets, bags, cushion covers, table-mats, shoes, slipper, ''[[jutti]]s'', and kids garments.&lt;ref name=tri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blooming tales of Phulkari|author=Poonam Bajaj |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130325/lifestyle-fashionbeauty/article/blooming-tales-phulkari |publisher=Deccan Chronicle |date=25 Mar 2013 |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, after a five-year-long legal case, Phulkari was awarded the [[geographical indication]] (GI) status in India, which means that after that only registered traders and manufacturers, from [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] [[Haryana]] and [[Rajasthan]] states would be able to use the term for the traditional craft, and the patent information centre (PIC) of Punjab State Council for Science and Technology would issue a logo or hologram  to distinguish the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GI status for Phulkari|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-19/chandigarh/28351582_1_gi-status-geographical-indication-haryana-and-rajasthan |publisher=The Times of India |date=Jan 19, 2011 |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piercing the corporate veil''' or '''lifting the corporate veil''' is a legal decision to treat the rights or duties of a [[corporation]] as the rights or liabilities of its [[shareholder]]s. Usually a corporation is treated as a [[Corporate personhood|separate legal person]], which is solely responsible for the debts it incurs and the sole beneficiary of the credit it is owed. [[Common law]] countries usually uphold this principle of separate [[personhood]], but in exceptional situations may "pierce" or "lift" the corporate veil.&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Piercing the Corporate Veil|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/corporate_veil.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example would be where a businessman has left his job as a director and has signed a [[contract]] to not compete with the company he has just left for a period of time. If he sets up a company which competed with his former company, technically it would be the company and not the person competing.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite book|last1=Henn|first1=Harry G.|last2=Alexander|first2=John R.|title=Law of Corporations|date=1983|publisher=West Group|isbn=0314092293|edition=3}}, ch 7, 344, n 2 for a list of terms the court uses. They are, mere adjunct, agent, alias, alter ego, alter idem, arm, blind, branch, buffer, cloak, coat, corporate double, cover, creature, curious reminiscence, delusion, department, dry shell, dummy, fiction, form, formality, fraud on the law, instrumentality, mouthpiece, name, [[nominal identity]], phrase, puppet, screen, sham, simulacrum, snare, stooge, subterfuge, tool.&lt;/ref&gt; But it is likely a court would say that the new company was just a "sham", a "cover" or some other phrase, and would still allow the old company to sue the man for breach of contract.

Despite the terminology used which makes it appear as though a shareholder's [[limited liability]] emanates from the view that a corporation is a separate legal entity, the reality is that the entity status of corporations has almost nothing to do with shareholder limited liability.&lt;ref name="MelvinAron"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Melvin A.|title=Corporations and Other Business Organizations, Cases and Materials|date=2005|publisher=Foundation Press|isbn=1587788799|edition=9}}, ch 4, 171&lt;/ref&gt; For example, English law conferred entity status on corporations long before shareholders were afforded limited liability. Similarly, the [[Revised Uniform Partnership Act]] confers entity status on partnerships, but also provides that partners are individually liable for all partnership obligations.  Therefore, this shareholder limited liability emanates mainly from statute.&lt;ref name="MelvinAron"/&gt;

==Basis for limited liability==
{{See also|Limited liability}}
Corporations exist in part to shield the personal assets of [[shareholders]] from personal liability for the debts or actions of a corporation. Unlike a [[general partnership]] or sole proprietorship in which the owner could be held responsible for all the debts of the company, a corporation traditionally limited the personal liability of the shareholders.

Piercing the corporate veil typically is most effective with smaller privately held business entities (close corporations) in which the corporation has a small number of shareholders, limited assets, and recognition of separateness of the corporation from its shareholders would promote fraud or an inequitable result.

There is no record of a successful piercing of the corporate veil for a publicly traded corporation because of the large number of shareholders and the extensive mandatory filings entailed in  qualifying for listing on an exchange.

==Germany==
{{See also|German company law}}
German corporate law developed a number of theories in the early 1920s for lifting the corporate veil on the basis of "domination" by a parent company over a subsidiary. Today, shareholders can be held liable in the case of an interference destroying the corporation. The corporation is entitled to a minimum of equitable funds. If these are taken away by the shareholder the corporation may claim compensation, even in an insolvency proceeding.

==United Kingdom==
{{Clist personality}}
{{See also|UK company law|Corporate veil in the United Kingdom}}
The corporate veil in UK company law is pierced very rarely. After a series of attempts by the Court of Appeal during the late 1960s and early 1970s to establish a theory of economic reality, and a doctrine of control for lifting the veil, the House of Lords reasserted an orthodox approach.  According to a 1990 case at the Court of Appeal, ''[[Adams v Cape Industries plc]]'', the only true "veil piercing" may take place when a company is set up for fraudulent purposes, or where it is established to avoid an existing obligation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Gilford Motor Ltd v Horne]]'' and ''[[Jones v Lipman]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The veil is also often ignored in the process of interpreting a statute,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Daimler v Continental Tyre]]'' and ''[[Re FG Films Ltd]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and as a matter of tort law it is open as a matter of authority that a direct duty of care may be owed by the managers of a parent company to accident victims of a subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Lubbe v Cape Plc]]''&lt;/ref&gt; There are also significant statements still among the judiciary in support of a broader veil lifting approach in the interests of "justice".

The issue is discussed at length in a 2013 UK Supreme Court case, ''[[Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd]]''.&lt;ref name="MacLeod"&gt;{{cite journal |last= MacLeod|first= Ceit-Anna |date= January 2014|title= Case Commentary: ''Prest v Petrodel''|url= |journal= Scottish Parliamentary Review|location= Edinburgh|publisher= Blacket Avenue Press|volume= I|issue= 2|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tort victims and employees===
Tort victims and employees, who did not contract with a company or have very [[unequal bargaining power]], have been held to be exempted from the rules of limited liability in ''[[Chandler v Cape plc]]''. In this case, the claimant was an employee of Cape plc's wholly owned subsidiary, which had gone insolvent. He successfully brought a claim in tort against Cape plc for causing him an asbestos disease, [[asbestosis]]. [[Arden LJ]] in the Court of Appeal held that if the parent had interfered in the operations of the subsidiary in any way, such as over trading issues, then it would be attached with responsibility for health and safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;See further, E McGaughey, 'Donoghue v Salomon in the High Court' (2011) 4 Journal of Personal Injury Law 249, on [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2237965 SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; Arden LJ emphasised that piercing the corporate veil was not necessary. There would be direct liability in tort for the parent company if it had interfered in the subsidiary's affairs. The High Court before it had held that liability would exist if the parent exercised control, all applying ordinary principles of tort law about liability of a third party for the actions of a tortfeasor. The restrictions on lifting the veil, found in contractual cases made no difference.

==="Single economic unit" theory===
It is an axiomatic principle of [[English law|English company law]] that a company is an entity separate and distinct from its members, who are liable only to the extent that they have contributed to the company's capital: ''[[Salomon v Salomon]]'' [1897]. The effect of this rule is that the individual subsidiaries within a conglomerate will be treated as separate entities and the parent cannot be made liable for the subsidiaries' debts on insolvency. Furthermore, it can create subsidiaries with inadequate capitalisation and secure loans to the subsidiaries with fixed charges over their assets, despite the fact that this is "not necessarily the most honest way of trading".&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[The Coral Rose (No 1)]]'' [1991], per [[Christopher Staughton|Staughton LJ]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule also applies in Scotland.&lt;ref name="MacLeod"/&gt;

While the secondary literature refers to different means of "lifting" or "piercing" the veil (see Ottolenghi (1959)), judicial dicta supporting the view that the rule in Salomon is subject to exceptions are thin on the ground. [[Lord Denning MR]] outlined the theory of the "single economic unit" - wherein the court examined the overall business operation as an economic unit, rather than strict legal form - in ''[[DHN Food Distributors v Tower Hamlets]]''.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;[1976]&lt;/ref&gt; However this has largely been repudiated and has been treated with caution in subsequent judgments.

In ''[[Woolfson v Strathclyde BC]]'',&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt; the [[House of Lords]] held that it was a decision to be confined to its facts (the question in DHN had been whether the subsidiary of the plaintiff, the former owning the premises on which the parent carried out its business, could receive compensation for loss of business under a [[compulsory purchase order]] notwithstanding that under the rule in Salomon, it was the parent and not the subsidiary that had lost the business). Likewise, in ''[[Bank of Tokyo v Karoon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1987] (PC)&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Goff, who had concurred in the result in ''DHN'', held that the legal conception of the corporate structure was entirely distinct from the economic realities.

The "single economic unit" theory was likewise rejected by the CA in ''[[Adams v Cape Industries]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1990]&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Christopher Slade|Slade LJ]] held that cases where the rule in Salomon had been circumvented were merely instances where they didn't know what to do. The view expressed at first instance by HHJ Southwell QC in ''[[Creasey v Breachwood]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992]&lt;/ref&gt; that English law "definitely" recognised the principle that the corporate veil could be lifted was described as a heresy by Hobhouse LJ in ''[[Ord v Bellhaven]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1998]&lt;/ref&gt; and these doubts were shared by Moritt V-C in ''[[Trustor v Smallbone (No 2)]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[2001]&lt;/ref&gt; the corporate veil cannot be lifted merely because justice requires it. Despite the rejection of the "justice of the case" test, it is observed from judicial reasoning in veil piercing cases that the courts employ "equitable discretion" guided by general principles such as mala fides to test whether the corporate structure has been used as a mere device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Capuano  | first = Angelo  | title = The Realist's Guide to Piercing the Corporate Veil   | ssrn = 1369110  | journal = Australian Journal of Corporate Law  | volume = 23  | pages = 56–94 | year = 2009 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfect obligation===
The cases of ''[[Tan v Lim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1962]&lt;/ref&gt; where a company was used as a [[Facade|"façade"]] (per Russell J.) to [[fraud|defraud]] the creditors of the defendant and ''[[Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1933]&lt;/ref&gt; where an injunction was granted against a trader setting up a business which was merely as a vehicle allowing him to circumvent a covenant in restraint of trade are often said to create a "[[fraud]]" exception to the separate corporate personality. Similarly, in ''[[Gencor v Dalby]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2000]&lt;/ref&gt; the tentative suggestion was made that the corporate veil was being lifted where the company was the "alter ego" of the defendant. In truth, as Lord Cooke (1997) has noted extrajudicially, it is because of the separate identity of the company concerned and not despite it that equity intervened in all of these cases. They are not instances of the corporate veil being pierced but instead involve the application of other rules of law.

===Reverse piercing===
There have been cases in which it is to the advantage of the shareholder to have the corporate structure ignored.  Courts have been reluctant to agree to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Lindgren  | first = Kevin E. |author2=R. B.

Mr Macaura was the sole owner of a company he had set up to grow timber. The trees were destroyed by fire but the insurer refused to pay since the policy was with Macaura (not the company) and he was not the owner of the trees. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] upheld that refusal based on the separate [[legal personality]] of the company.

===Criminal law===
In English criminal law there have been cases in which the courts have been prepared to pierce the veil of incorporation.  For example, in confiscation proceedings under the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]] monies received by a company can, depending upon the particular facts of the case as found by the court, be regarded as having been 'obtained' by an individual (who is usually, but not always, a director of the company).  In consequence those monies may become an element in the individual's 'benefit' obtained from criminal conduct (and hence subject to confiscation from him).&lt;ref&gt;David Winch, [http://www.accountingevidence.com/blog/2013/01/confiscation-lifting-the-veil-of-incorporation "Confiscation: lifting the veil of incorporation"] (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The position regarding 'piercing the veil' in English criminal law was given in the Court of Appeal judgment in the case of ''[[R v Seager]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2009] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/1303.html EWCA Crim 1303]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the court said (at para 76):

{{quote|There was no major disagreement between counsel on the legal principles by reference to which a court is entitled to "pierce" or "rend" or "remove" the "corporate veil". It is "hornbook" law that a duly formed and registered company is a separate legal entity from those who are its shareholders and it has rights and liabilities that are separate from its shareholders. A court can "pierce" the carapace of the corporate entity and look at what lies behind it only in certain circumstances. It cannot do so simply because it considers it might be just to do so. Each of these circumstances involves impropriety and dishonesty. The court will then be entitled to look for the legal substance, not the just the form. In the context of criminal cases the courts have identified at least three situations when the corporate veil can be pierced. First if an offender attempts to shelter behind a corporate façade, or veil to hide his crime and his benefits from it. Secondly, where an offender does acts in the name of a company which (with the necessary [[mens rea]]) constitute a criminal offence which leads to the offender's conviction, then "the veil of incorporation is not so much pierced as rudely torn away": per Lord Bingham in [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/29.html Jennings v CPS], paragraph 16. Thirdly, where the transaction or business structures constitute a "device", "cloak" or "sham", i.e. an attempt to disguise the true nature of the transaction or structure so as to deceive third parties or the courts.}}

In the United States, corporate veil piercing is the most litigated issue in corporate law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Thompson  | first =Robert B.  | title=Piercing the Corporate Veil: An Empirical Study | journal=Cornell Law Review  | volume=76  | pages=1036–1074 | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although courts are reluctant to hold an active shareholder liable for actions that are legally the responsibility of the corporation, even if the corporation has a single shareholder, they will often do so if the corporation was markedly noncompliant with corporate formalities, to prevent fraud, or to achieve equity in certain cases of undercapitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelb|first1=Harvey|title=Piercing the Corporate Veil - The Undercapitalization Factor|journal=Chicago Kent Law Review|date=December 1982|volume=59|issue=1|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2470&amp;context=cklawreview|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macey|first1=Jonathan|last2=Mitts|first2=Joshua|title=Finding Order in the Morass: The Three Real Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|journal=Cornell Law Review|date=2014|volume=100|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/clqv100&amp;div=6&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most jurisdictions, no [[bright-line rule]] exists and the ruling is based on common law precedents. In the United States, different theories, most important "alter ego" or "instrumentality rule", attempted to create a piercing standard. Mostly, they rest upon three basic prongs—namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rands|first1=William J.|title=Domination of a Subsidiary by a Parent|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=1998|volume=32|page=421|url=https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/ilr/pdf/vol32p421.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"unity of interest and ownership": the separate personalities of the shareholder and corporation cease to exist,
*"wrongful conduct": wrongful action taken by the corporation, and
*"proximate cause": as a reasonably foreseeable result of the wrongful action, harm was caused to the party that is seeking to pierce the corporate veil.
However, the theories failed to articulate a real-world approach which courts could directly apply to their cases. Thus, courts struggle with the proof of each prong and rather analyze all given factors. This is known as "totality of circumstances".&lt;ref name="DHB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barber|first1=David H.|title=Piercing the Corporate Veil|journal=Williamette Law Review|volume=17|page=371|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/willr17&amp;div=35&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the matter of what [[jurisdiction]] the corporation is incorporated in if the corporation is authorized to do business in more than one state. All corporations have one specific state (their "home" state) to which they are incorporated as a [[domestic corporation|"domestic" corporation]], and if they operate in other states, they would apply for authority to do business in those other states as a [[foreign corporation|"foreign" corporation]].  In determining whether or not the corporate veil may be pierced, the courts are required to use the laws of the corporation's home state.  This issue can be significant; for example, [[California]] law is more liberal in allowing a corporate veil to be pierced, while the laws of neighboring [[Nevada]] makes doing so more difficult. Thus, the owner(s) of a corporation operating in California would be subject to different potential for the corporation's veil to be pierced if the corporation was to be sued, depending on whether the corporation was a California domestic corporation or was a Nevada foreign corporation operating in California.

Generally, the plaintiff has to prove that the incorporation was merely a formality and that the corporation neglected corporate formalities and protocols, such as voting to approve major [[corporate action]]s in the context of a duly authorized corporate meeting. This is quite often the case when a corporation facing legal liability transfers its assets and business to another corporation with the same management and shareholders. It also happens with single person corporations that are managed in a haphazard manner. As such, the veil can be pierced in both civil cases and where regulatory proceedings are taken against a shell corporation.

===Factors for courts to consider===
Factors that a court may consider when determining whether or not to pierce the corporate veil include the following:&lt;ref name="DHB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="al"/&gt;

*Absence or inaccuracy of corporate records;
*Concealment or misrepresentation of members;
*Failure to maintain arm's length relationships with related entities;
*Failure to observe corporate formalities in terms of behavior and documentation;
*Intermingling of [[assets]] of the corporation and of the shareholder;
*Manipulation of assets or liabilities to concentrate the assets or liabilities;
*Non-functioning corporate officers and/or directors;
*Significant undercapitalization of the business entity (capitalization requirements vary based on industry, location, and specific company circumstances);
*Siphoning of corporate funds by the dominant shareholder(s);
*Treatment by an individual of the assets of corporation as his/her own;
*Was the corporation being used as a "façade" for dominant shareholder(s) personal dealings; alter ego theory;

It is important to note that not all of these factors need to be met in order for the court to pierce the corporate veil. Further, some courts might find that one factor is so compelling in a particular case that it will find the shareholders personally liable. For example, many large corporations do not pay dividends, without any suggestion of corporate impropriety, but particularly for a small or close corporation the failure to pay dividends may suggest financial impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macey|first1=Jonathan R.|title=The Three Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/03/27/the-three-justifications-for-piercing-the-corporate-veil/|website=Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====

Here a corporation was undercapitalized and was only used to shield a shareholder's other company from debts.

===Internal Revenue Service===
{{See also|United States Internal Revenue Service}}
In recent years, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) in the United States has made use of corporate veil piercing arguments and logic as a means of recapturing [[Income tax in the United States|income]], [[Estate tax (United States)|estate]], or [[gift tax]] revenue, particularly from business entities created primarily for [[estate planning]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice CC-2012-002|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-ccdm/cc-2012-002.pdf|website=Office of Chief Counsel|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[U.S. Tax Court]] cases involving [[Family Limited Partnership]]s (FLPs) illustrate the IRS's use of veil-piercing arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gans|first1=Mitchell M.|last2=Blattmachr|first2=Jonathan G.|title=Family Limited Partnership Formation: Dueling Dicta|journal=Capital University Law Review|date=2006|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/capulr35&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since owners of U.S. business entities created for asset protection and estate purposes often fail to maintain proper corporate compliance, the IRS has achieved multiple high-profile court victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higham|first1=Scott|title=For U.S. tax cheats, Panama Papers reveal a perilous new world|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/for-us-tax-cheats-panama-papers-reveals-a-perilous-new-world/2016/04/08/a3467e9a-fd9f-11e5-886f-a037dba38301_story.html|accessdate=9 September 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blank|first1=Joshua D.|last2=Staudt|first2=Nancy C.|title=Corporate Shams|url=http://gould.usc.edu/centers/class/class-workshops/cleo-working-papers/documents/C12_8_paper.pdf|website=NYU Center for Law, Economics and Organization|publisher=New York University School of Law|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverse piercing ===
Reverse veil piercing is when the debt of a shareholder is imputed onto the corporation. Throughout the United States, the general rule is that reverse veil piercing is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaertner|first1=M.J.|title=Reverse Piercing the Corporate Veil: Should Corporation Owners Have It Both Ways|journal=William and Mary Law Review|date=1988|volume=30|page=667|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wmlr30&amp;div=37&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the California Court of Appeals has allowed reverse veil piercing against a [[limited liability company]] (LLC) based largely on the difference in remedies available to creditors when it comes to attaching assets of a debtors' LLC as compared to attaching assets of a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curci Investments, LLC v.

'''The Piracy Act 1698''' (11 Will 3 c 7) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]] passed in the eleventh year of [[William III of England|William III]]. The [[long title]] of the Act is "An Act for the more effectual suppression of Piracy". &lt;ref&gt;'William III, 1698-9: An Act for the more effectual suppression of Piracy. [Chapter VII. Rot. Parl. 11 Gul. III. p. 2. n. 5.]', Statutes of the Realm: volume 7: 1695-1701 (1820), pp. 590-94. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=46966. Date accessed: 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose behind the statute was to make some corrections to the [[Offences at Sea Act 1536]] (28 Hen 8, c. 15). The 1700 statute states that “it hath been found by experience” that the courts met with “great trouble and charges in sending them into England” to be tried for their crimes or cannot easily “be questioned for such their piracies and robberies” because this was the necessary measure for enforcing the law under the statute of Henry the VIII.  The 1700 statute changed this law to allow for acts of piracy to be “examined, inquired of, tried, heard and determined, and adjudged in any place at sea, or upon the land, in any of his Majesty’s islands, plantations, colonies, dominions, forts, or factories”.  This enabled admirals to hold a court session to hear the trials of pirates in any place they deemed necessary, rather than requiring that the trial be held in England.

The statute then proceeds to explain what is required for these admiralty court sessions to function, how they will run, and what powers that statute grants to the commissioners. The commissioners can “call and assemble a court of admiralty when and as often as occasion shall require”.  In addition, these courts shall consist of at least seven people who “are known merchants, factors, or planters, or such as are captains, lieutenants, or warrant officers” and who are “fitting and voting in the said court”.  The statute also grants the commissioners of these vice-admiralty courts with “full power and authority” to issue warrants, summon the necessary witnesses, and “to do all thing necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy, robbery, or felony”.  The statute then moves to instruct the commissioners on the proceedings of the courts in a significant amount of detail ranging from the oath that the president of the court must take, what actions were to be taken upon pleas of guilty or not guilty, and how to examine witnesses and give sentence.

In addition, the statute adds additional instances, not listed in the Offences at Sea Act of 1536, which expanded the legal definition of piracy as a capital crime. The first of these includes any subject of the crown who commits any act of piracy “under colour of any commission from any foreign prince or state.”  Additionally, any commander who “piratically and feloniously run away with his or their ships", anyone who may “consult, combine, or confederate” with any pirates, or “shall lay violent hands upon his commander whereby to hinder him from fighting” pirates who may be attempting to capture their vessel. 

This statute also added the offence of being an accessory to piracy. Under the 1700 statute, any individual who may “knowingly or willingly … aid and assist, or maintain, procure, command, counsel, or advise” and persons to commit any act of piracy “shall be deemed and adjudged to be accessory to such piracy”.  This title of accessory was also extended to any persons who “receive, entertain, or conceal any such pirate or robber”.  These accessories “shall be enquired of, tried, heard, determined, and adjudged” following the statute of 1536 by Henry VIII and “shall suffer such pains of death” just as the pirates themselves would.
	
The majority of the cases tried under these admiralty courts followed the exact proceedings laid out in the 1700 statute. In addition, most pirates appeared to have been given a fair trial because, if the accused could not be confirmed to have taken part in the said piracy by witness testimony, they were often acquitted. However, in the admiralty court, murder was almost always considered the more serious charge. In fact, during a 1737 case in which Edward Johnson and Nicholas Williams were being tried, the Counsel proceeded with the murder charge after stating:  “I will not touch upon the Piracy, that will come under your consideration hereafter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Old Bailey|defendant=Edward Johnson, Nicholas Williams, Lawrence Senett, Nicholas Wolf, Pierce Butler, and John Bryan|trialdate=24 February 1737|id=t17370224-2|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the Counsel prosecuted the accused for piracy only after the trial for murder was finished. 

The death penalty under this Act was abolished by the [[Piracy Act 1837]]. 

In the United Kingdom, the whole Act was repealed by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/50/section/1 section 1(1)] of, and Group 2 of [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/50/schedule/1/part/I Part I] of Schedule 1 to, the [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1993]].

The Piracy Act 1698 was repealed for the [[Australian Capital Territory]] by section 6(1) of, and Part 4.11 of Schedule 4 to, the ''[[Statute Law Amendment Act 2002 (No 2)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2002-49/20030117-3526/pdf/2002-49.pdf PDF copy]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Professional ethics}}
{{Professional responsibility}}
'''Professional responsibility''' is the area of legal practice that encompasses the duties of [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to act in a professional manner, obey the law, avoid [[conflicts of interest]], and put the interests of clients ahead of their own interests.

==Violations in normal==
Common violations include
* Conflicts of interest. This occurs where the same lawyer or firm is representing both sides in a lawsuit, or previously represented one side. In countries with the [[adversarial system]] of justice, a conflict of interest violates the right of each client to the undivided, zealous loyalty of his lawyer. Conflicts may also occur if the lawyer's ability to represent a client is materially limited by the lawyer's loyalty to another client, a personal relationship, or other reasons.
* Incompetent representation. Attorneys have a duty to provide competent representation, and the failure to observe deadlines or conduct thorough research is considered a breach of ethics.
* Mishandling of client money. Clients often advance money to lawyers for a variety of reasons. The money must be kept in special client trust accounts until it is actually earned by the lawyer or spent on court fees or other expenses.
* Fee-splitting arrangements. Attorneys may not split fees with non-attorneys, or with other attorneys who have not worked on the matter for which the client is represented.
* Disclosure of confidential information. Lawyers are under a strict [[duty of confidentiality]] to keep information received in the course of their representations secret. Absent law to the contrary, lawyers may not reveal or use this information to the detriment of their clients.
* Communication with represented parties. An attorney may not communicate directly with a person who they know to be represented by counsel with respect to a matter for which the attorney is seeking to communicate. For example, in a civil suit, the plaintiff's attorney may not speak to the defendant directly if the attorney knows that the defendant is represented by counsel without their attorney's express consent.
* Proper solicitation and advertising. Attorneys generally may solicit business by personally offering their services to potential clients who are not already close friends or family members. Advertising by attorneys is also strictly regulated, to prevent puffery and other misleading assertions regarding potential results.

Following the [[Watergate scandal]], which involved questionable behavior by a number of lawyers, the [[American Bar Association]] ("ABA") mandated that all [[Law school in the United States|American law schools]] incorporate a required course on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=American Bar Association|title=ABA Standards and Rules of Procedure for Approval of Law Schools 2015-2016|date=2015|publisher=American Bar Association|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1-63425-352-9|page=16|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/misc/legal_education/Standards/2015_2016_aba_standards_for_approval_of_law_schools_final.authcheckdam.pdf|accessdate=15 December 2016|chapter=Standard 303, Curriculum}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically offered as an upper-level course, most often taken in the second year. Professional Responsibility courses include matters pertaining to basic [[legal ethics]], as well as [[Admission to the bar in the United States|bar admissions]], [[legal advertising]], [[disbarment]] proceedings, [[ineffective assistance of counsel]], and [[judicial misconduct]].

[[Maynard Pirsig]], published one of the first course books on legal ethics, ''Cases and Materials on Legal Ethics'', 1949, later ''Cases and Materials on the Standards of the Legal Profession'', 1957, and ''Cases and Materials on Professional Responsibility'', 1965.

[[Maynard Pirsig]] also published the definition of ''Legal Ethics,'' in ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', 1974.

===Examinations===
Every state in the [[United States]] tests prospective attorneys on their knowledge of professional responsibility. 47 states and the [[District of Columbia]] require bar applicants to pass an exam called the [[Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam]] ("MPRE"). The remaining three states test professional responsibility on their local [[bar examination]]s. Furthermore, the ABA promulgated the [[ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Schneyer, "Professionalism as Politics: The Making of a Modern Legal Ethics Code," in ''Lawyers' Ideals/Lawyers' Practices: Transformations in the American Legal Profession'', eds. Robert L. Nelson, David M. Trubek, &amp; Rayman L. Solomon, 95–143 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992), 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference| title = ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct | url = http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents.html | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1983; when Maine adopted the Model Rules in August 2009, California became the only remaining U.S. jurisdiction not to have adopted the Model Rules in whole or in part. Most states have only minor variations from the Model Rules, if any. Attorneys who violate professional responsibility rules may be subject to [[Sanctions (law)|sanction]]s ranging from reprimands to temporary suspension to permanent disbarment. The responsibility is defined as ''a charge assigned to a unique actor to signify its accountabilities concerning a unique business task''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference | author = Feltus C. | title = Aligning Access Rights to Governance Needs with the Responsibility MetaModel (ReMMo) in the Frame of Enterprise Architecture | date=March 11 | url = http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal:144013 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3438">The '''Rouanet Law''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[law]] named after [[Sérgio Paulo Rouanet]] whose role is providing monetary funds for use in art and culture, including the production of movies. It is intended to encourage cultural investments and its major highlight is the tax incentive policy that enables companies and citizens to deduct a portion of [[income tax]].

All projects must be approved by the Brazilian [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Ministry of Culture]] that examines technical feasibility of activities. 

== Controversies ==

Despite the pros, there is criticism against the law, which includes the possibility of funds being misappropriated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,fundacao-de-sarney-da-verba-da-petrobras-a-empresas-fantasmas,400045|title=Fundação de Sarney dá verba da Petrobrás a empresas fantasmas - Política - Estadão|work=Estadão|access-date=2018-11-22|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also argue that the Ministry, rather than directly investing in culture, began to let companies themselves decide which kind of culture deserved to be sponsored.

The [[Federal government of Brazil|government]]'s incentives to culture sums up to R$310 million (approximately US$82 million), in which R$30 million (U$8 million) goes to the {{ILL|National Arts Foundation|pt}} and R$280 million (U$74 million) to the Rouanet Law, while the tax incentive no longer collects R$1 billion (US$263 million) to the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2009/07/597440-nova-lei-rouanet-empaca-no-calendario.shtml|title=Nova Lei Rouanet empaca no calendário|work=Folha de S.Paulo|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, an attempt to revoke the Rouanet Law ruled the [[Federal Senate]]. The 2017 Legislative Suggestion Nº 49 requested the revocation of the law, but was rejected by the Human Rights Commission and Participatory Legislation of the Senate, following the report of Senator [[Marta Suplicy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/materias/2018/06/13/cdh-rejeita-sugestao-popular-para-o-fim-da-lei-rouanet|title=CDH rejeita sugestão popular para o fim da Lei Rouanet|date=2018-06-13|work=Senado Federal|access-date=2018-11-22|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://folhapolitica.jusbrasil.com.br/noticias/498807242/em-38-horas-extincao-da-lei-rouanet-alcanca-20-mil-apoios-e-virara-projeto-no-senado|title=Em 38 horas, extinção da Lei Rouanet alcança 20 mil apoios e virará projeto no Senado|work=Jusbrasil|access-date=2018-11-22|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culturaemercado.com.br/site/noticias/pedido-de-revogacao-da-lei-rouanet-e-elevado-sugestao-legislativa/|title=Pedido de revogação da Lei Rouanet é elevado à Sugestão Legislativa - Cultura e Mercado|website=www.culturaemercado.com.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2743">A '''select committee''' is a [[committee]] made up of a small number of [[member of parliament|parliamentary members]] appointed to deal with particular areas or issues originating in the [[Westminster system]] of [[parliamentary democracy]]. Select committees exist in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], as well as in other parliaments based on the Westminster model, such as those in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]].

It is a special [[subcommittee]] of a legislature or assembly governed under a [[committee|committee system]], like ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]''. They are often investigative in nature, collecting data or evidence for a law or problem, and will dissolve immediately&lt;ref&gt;In [[Italy]] the Constitutional Court, in its judgment no. 241 of 2007, stated that, at the ending of a Committee, its legal standing is absorbed by the House as a whole: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Caso Ilaria Alpi: quando la leale collaborazione tra poteri dello Stato è tradita (e non dai magistrati)|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2008| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89405520}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after they report their findings to their superiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.education2020.com/activities/vocab.aspx?keystr=12810&amp;order=03010405&amp;stbl=2196465] -  Education 2020, definition of "select committee"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Eliakim Weeks.jpg|thumb|200px|John E. Weeks, Governor from 1927 to 1931, Addison County Assistant Judge from 1884 to 1886.]]

'''Side judge''', or '''assistant judge''', is a judicial position apparently unique to the state of [[Vermont]].  There are two side judges in each of Vermont's 14 counties.

==Duties and responsibilities==
[[File:Jonas Galusha.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Jonas Galusha, Governor from 1809 to 1813 and 1815 to 1820, Bennington County Assistant Judge from 1795 to 1798.]]
[[File:Montpelier courthouse 6.JPG|thumb|125px|Courthouse in Montpelier, shire town of Washington County.]]
While Family, District and Superior Court judges are appointed by the Governor, probate and side judges are elected.  Side judges run [[at-large]] (not specifically for one of the two seats) and county-wide in November of even-numbered, non-presidential election years, and serve four-year terms.  The terms begin on the following February 1.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Superior Court, [http://info.libraries.vermont.gov/supct/current/eo2009-449.html In re Assistant Judge Calvin Colby] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112061345/http://info.libraries.vermont.gov/supct/current/eo2009-449.html |date=2015-01-12 }}, December 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of a vacancy, the [[Governor of Vermont|Governor]] is empowered to appoint a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Poli, Brattleboro Reformer, [http://www.reformer.com/localnews/ci_21288314/gov-appoints-barnett-windham-county-side-judge Gov. Appoints Barnett as Windham County Side Judge], August 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Side judges sit with the judge in [[Superior court#United States|Superior]] (civil cases and violations of traffic laws and municipal ordinances) and [[Family law|Family]] Court.  There are Superior and Family Courts located in each of Vermont's 14 counties at their "shire town" or county seat.&lt;ref&gt;State of Vermont Judiciary, [https://www.vermontjudiciary.org/GTC/civil/default.aspx Vermont Superior Court: Civil Division], retrieved January 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;State of Vermont Judiciary, [https://www.vermontjudiciary.org/GTC/Family/default.aspx State of Vermont Judiciary: family Court], retrieved January 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There are normally two side judges on the bench, but the court may proceed with only one side judge or none.  In theory the side judges, who are generally not attorneys, have input only on matters of fact, with matters of law left to the presiding judge, but the vote of a side judge has the same weight as that of the judge, so two side judges can outvote the judge. If there is only one side judge and the side judge and the judge disagree on a matter of fact, a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] is declared.&lt;ref&gt;Brattleboro Reformer, [http://www.reformer.com/ci_14849385?source=most_emailed Disorder in the Courts], April 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Side judges who undergo some training may also sit alone in small claims, uncontested divorces, traffic offenses, and violations of municipal ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Cesari, Randolph Herald, [http://www.ourherald.com/news/2007-12-06/Front_page/f03.html ‘Side Judges’ Wear Two Hats] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116183657/http://www.ourherald.com/news/2007-12-06/Front_page/f03.html |date=2014-01-16 }}, December 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Side judges have administrative duties in addition to court responsibilities. They appoint the County Clerk, Treasurer and Auditor, Road Commissioners, and Notaries Public, manage the county courthouse, sheriff's office and other property, and prepare the county budget.&lt;ref&gt;State of Vermont, [http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullchapter.cfm?Title=24&amp;Chapter=005  The Vermont Statutes Online], Title 24: Municipal and County Government, Chapter 5: County Officers; Powers and Duties, Sub-Chapter 1: Assistant Judges, retrieved January 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, side judges receive two types of compensation: a salary for their administrative duties, paid by the county, and a per diem for their judicial duties, paid by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Mitch Wertlieb, Vermont Public Radio, [http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/86832/assistant-judges-against-proposal-to-reduce-duties/ Assistant Judges Against Proposal To Reduce Duties], January 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the county budget has been determined, municipalities in the county are assessed a portion, based on their grand list (total evaluation of property in the municipality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Joseph | last=Gresser | title=Side judges see $50,000 bump in county budget | url=| work= | newspaper=The Chronicle | location=Barton, Vermont | pages= 16 | date=December 19, 2012 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermont's Assistant Judges also have a professional association and lobbying group, the Vermont Association of County Judges.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Association of County Judges, [http://www.vtassistantjudges.com/2013/ Home Page: Vermont Association of County Judges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117003501/http://www.vtassistantjudges.com/2013/ |date=2014-01-17 }}, retrieved January 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The position of side judge was part of Vermont's government during the mid to late 1700s period of the [[Vermont Republic]], and was continued in the [[Constitution of Vermont|Vermont Constitution]] when Vermont was admitted to the Union as the fourteenth state in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Archives and records Administration, [http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/constitut/con77.htm Vermont Constitution of 1777, Section XXVII] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725151010/http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/constitut/con77.htm |date=2012-07-25 }}, retrieved January 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Archives and records Administration, [http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/constitut/con93.htm Vermont Constitution of 1793, Section 9th] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220020826/http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/constitut/con93.htm |date=2014-02-20 }}, retrieved January 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of side judges appear to have been borrowed from the colony of [[Pennsylvania]], and they were also part of the judiciary in other states, including [[New Hampshire]] and [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;David W. Belisle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=azoVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22side+judge%22+pennsylvania&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iiDZUpjyPOmqsASa_YHAAQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22side%20judge%22%20pennsylvania&amp;f=false History of Independence Hall], 1859, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Ellis, Samuel Evans, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WsQxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22assistant+judge%22+pennsylvania+colony&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kiHZUpvxDqu-sQSK-oGoCA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22assistant%20judge%22%20pennsylvania%20colony&amp;f=false History of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania], 1883, page 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Pennsylvania, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWUUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=%22assistant+judge%22+pennsylvania+colony&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kiHZUpvxDqu-sQSK-oGoCA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22assistant%20judge%22%20pennsylvania%20colony&amp;f=false Register of Pennsylvania Society], 1907, page 227&lt;/ref&gt;  In Vermont, they were created in part because early Vermont residents were distrustful of lawyers, many of whom had received their training in [[England]] before the [[American Revolution]], making their loyalty suspect, or had supported [[Colony of New York|New York]] during the dispute between New York's colonial government and Vermont's original white settlers over control of Vermont's first towns.  The founders of Vermont had purchased their land grants from [[Benning Wentworth]], the [[Governor of New Hampshire]].  When the British government supported New York's attempts to assert control, those with New Hampshire land grants refused to re-purchase them from New York.  Adding lay judges to the courts was a means of ensuring that pro-British or pro-New York judges could not control the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Bar Association, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=IyPZUomXM4qwsQSn8ICIAw&amp;id=cqI4AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=vermont+distrustful+lawyers+new+york&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=resentment The Vermont Bar Journal &amp; Law Digest], Volume 16, 1990, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Alan Cohen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LzYXfcS08kkC&amp;pg=PA434&amp;dq=vermont+%22assistant+judge%22+distrust+lawyers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JSTZUryAJc2-sQT284HwBw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vermont%20%22assistant%20judge%22%20distrust%20lawyers&amp;f=false The Criminal Process in the People's Republic of China, 1949-1963], Volume 2, 1968, page 434&lt;/ref&gt;

Though reorganization of the judiciary in other states eliminated the side judge position, It has continued in Vermont.  Some updates and changes to Vermont's court system included elimination or a reduced role for the side judges, but most of those efforts have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Roman, Stowe Today, [http://www.stowetoday.com/stowe_reporter/news/local_news/article_e3309b9a-5503-5c03-b779-3bbde8c27f66.html?mode=jqm Side Judges Fight Against Extinction: Efficiency Study Favors Eliminating the Elected Posts], July 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caledonian Record, [http://caledonianrecord.com/Main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=47519 Judicial Plan Doesn't Cut Side Judges] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140117130342/http://caledonianrecord.com/Main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=47519 |date=2014-01-17 }}, November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Special Field Orders No. 120''' (series 1864) were military orders issued during the [[American Civil War]], on November 9, 1864, by [[Major General]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] of the [[Union Army]]. He issued these orders in preparation for his famous [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]], also known as the Savannah Campaign.

==Orders==
{{Quotation|Headquarters  Military Division of the Mississippi, 
In the Field, Kingston, Georgia, November 9, 1864

I.  For the purpose of military operations, this army is divided into two wings viz.: The right wing, Major-General O. O. Howard commanding, composed of the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps; the left wing, Major-General H. W. Slocum commanding, composed of the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps.

II. The habitual order of march will be, wherever practicable, by four roads, as nearly parallel as possible, and converging at points hereafter to be indicated in orders.  The cavalry, Brigadier - General Kilpatrick commanding, will receive special orders from the commander-in-chief.

III. There will be no general train of supplies, but each corps will have its ammunition-train and provision-train, distributed habitually as follows:  Behind each regiment should follow one wagon and one ambulance; behind each brigade should follow a due proportion of ammunition - wagons, provision-wagons, and ambulances.  In case of danger, each corps commander should change this order of march, by having his advance and rear brigades unencumbered by wheels.  The separate columns will start habitually at 7 a.m., and make about fifteen miles per day, unless otherwise fixed in orders.

IV. The army will forage liberally on the country during the march. To this end, each brigade commander will organize a good and sufficient foraging party, under the command of one or more discreet officers, who will gather, near the route traveled, corn or forage of any kind, meat of any kind, vegetables, corn-meal, or whatever is needed by the command, aiming at all times to keep in the wagons at least ten day's provisions for the command and three days' forage. Soldiers must not enter the dwellings of the inhabitants, or commit any trespass, but during a halt or a camp they may be permitted to gather turnips, potatoes, and other vegetables, and to drive in stock of their camp. To regular foraging parties must be instructed the gathering of provisions and forage at any distance from the road traveled.

V. To army corps commanders alone is intrusted the power to destroy mills, houses, cotton-gins, &amp;c., and for them this general principle is laid down: In districts and neighborhoods where the army is unmolested no destruction of such property should be permitted; but should guerrillas or bushwhackers molest our march, or should the inhabitants burn bridges, obstruct roads, or otherwise manifest local hostility, then army commanders should order and enforce a devastation more or less relentless according to the measure of such hostility.

VI. As for horses, mules, wagons, &amp;c., belonging to the inhabitants, the cavalry and artillery may appropriate freely and without limit, discriminating, however, between the rich, who are usually hostile, and the poor or industrious, usually neutral or friendly. Foraging parties may also take mules or horses to replace the jaded animals of their trains, or to serve as pack-mules for the regiments or bridges. In all foraging, of whatever kind, the parties engaged will refrain from abusive or threatening language, and may, where the officer in command thinks proper, give written certificates of the facts, but no receipts, and they will endeavor to leave with each family a reasonable portion for their maintenance.

VII. Negroes who are able-bodied and can be of service to the several columns may be taken along, but each army commander will bear in mind that the question of supplies is a very important one and that his first duty is to see to them who bear arms. |William T. Sherman|Military Division of the Mississippi Special Field Order 120, November 9, 1864&lt;ref&gt;http://history.ncsu.edu/projects/cwnc/items/show/145&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Transport Act of 1985''' was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]], it introduced privatized and deregulated [[Bus transport in the United Kingdom|bus services]] throughout [[Great Britain]] and came into effect in October of 1986.

The '''Transport Act of 1985''' was created as a response to growing concern about the [[Environmental issue|environmental effect]] the [[Private transport|private transportation]] was having and the public's objection to an increase in [[Construction|road construction]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poole|first=Fiona|date=|title=Buses|url=|journal=Research Paper 99/59|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Transport Act of 1985''' was introduced by [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the Act committed to reduce the amount the public paid for commercial objects. This was achieved by reducing the control governments had of bus systems and reducing the subsidies to bus companies. The Conservative government also believed the removal of [[Subsidy|subsidies]] and local government control would lead to an increase in competition between companies. The deregulation of Buses applied throughout the [[United Kingdom]], excluding bus services in Greater [[London]], and was lead by the [[Conservative government]].  &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balcombe|first=RJ.|date=|title=Effects of the Transport Acr 1985 Outside Conurbations: A comparative study|url=|journal=Research Report 247|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Infobox UK legislation

==Deregulation and Elimination of Barriers==

==== Proposal ====
In 1984 a proposal to deregulate local bus services was published in the white paper ''Buses'' and in more detailed consultation papers. The '''Transport Act of 1985 (part I)''' brought these proposals into effect. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deregulation, elimination of barriers, and the transfer to the private sector were some of the major changes the '''Transport Act of 1985''' established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=B.J|date=|title=Deregulation and privatization: The British local bus industry following the transport act 1985|url=|journal=Transport Reviews|volume=16|pages=213-233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Privatization and [[Bus deregulation in Great Britain|bus deregulation]] came into effect on 26 October 1986.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Local authorities were required to transfer their [[History of the PTE bus operations|municipally-owned bus services]] to separate companies. Although most of these companies have since been [[Privatization|privatized]], with the exception of [[Lothian Buses]] in Edinburgh; a few other [[Municipal bus company|municipal bus companies]] remain today. The '''Transport Act of 1985''' also mandated that [[Local government|local governments]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;publish statements of their own polices for bus services deemed socially vital that were not operated by commercial companies. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== London ====
London faced a different type of deregulation. The standard deregulation that applied to other cities in the United Kingdom was not applied to [[Buses in London|bus services in Greater London]]; instead, the Act brought about [[Privatisation of London bus services|a system of franchised routes]] operated by private companies but managed by [[London Buses]] Ltd. Meaning that although the bus companies in London were [[Privatization|privatized]] London's government still retained the ability to [[regulation|regulate]] the companies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savage|first=Ian|date=|title=Deregulation and Privatization of Britain's Local Bus Industry|url=|journal=Journal of Regulatory Economics|volume=|pages=143-158|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the '''Transport Act of 1985''' was put into place London Bus companies were governed by the [[London Regional Transport Act 1984|London Regional Transport Act of 1984]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Transport Act 1985: Deregulation (Part I) ====
Part I of the '''Transport Act of 1985''' [[wikt:eradicate|eradicate]]d, excluding London, the need for the required [[License|road service licence]] throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. Part I replaced service licensing with a system of registration. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This caused licensing authorities losing many of their powers and made it possible for operators to register new routes. For an operator to register a new route the licensed operator had to supply the traffic commissioner with information of the proposed route, the timeline for the trip, stopping arrangements, the [[Vehicle|vehicles]] to be used, and the terminal points. In accordance with the Act the traffic commissioner had to received the registration at least 42 days prior to when the route is to be run. It was mandatory for the notice to go through the [[traffic commissioner]] for a licence [[Bus|bus operator]] to operate. After approval the operator was required to run the route according to the specifications provided in the registration. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deregulation also lead to firms being able to charge any fares they wish, run routes, and freely enter and leave the market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was accomplished by reducing the amount of subsides local governments could provide for services. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Transport Act 1985: Privatization (Part II) ====
Privatization proposals were put forth to change the structure of the bus industry. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The bus industry was managed mainly by [[public sector]] companies in the years prior to 1985. [[Privatization]] was introduced by the [[Conservative government]] as a way to achieve better access to private capital and more committed management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to achieve this goal the Conservative government made it so local governments could only provide subsides for services and prohibited subsidies that would promote low fares. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The '''Transport Act of 1985''' changed how bus services were run in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Act introduced the largest change in the framework of bus services in over five decades and it replaced the prior [[Publicly owned company|publicly owned]] and highly regulated bus service with a largely competitive commercial system. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walmsley|first=D.A.|date=|title=THE EARLY EFFECTS OF THE 1985 TRANSPORT ACT IN TYNE AND WEAR|url=|journal=Research Report 226|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the removal of [[Subsidy|subsidies]] made it so different firms had to bid on the right to operate with subsidized services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An '''unlawful combatant''', '''illegal combatant''' or '''unprivileged combatant/belligerent''' is a person who directly engages in [[armed conflict]] in violation of the [[Law of war|laws of war]]. An unlawful combatant may be detained or prosecuted under the [[domestic law]] of the detaining state for such action, subject to [[international treaties]] on [[justice]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="ICRC-210705"&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] official statement: ''[https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/terrorism-ihl-210705.htm The relevance of IHL in the context of terrorism]'', 1 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlViolating ethics: unlawful combatants, national security and health professionals"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Violating ethics: unlawful combatants, national security and health professionals | pmc=2598252 | pmid=17329383 | doi=10.1136/jme.2006.016550 | volume=33 | issue=3 | year=2007 | journal=J Med Ethics | pages=143–5 | author=Holmes D, Perron A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlFreedom fighters and rebels: the rules of civil war"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Freedom fighters and rebels: the rules of civil war | pmc=1279138 | pmid=11773342 | volume=95 | issue=1 | year=2002 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=3–4 | author=Rowe P | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:100franctireur.jpg|thumb|Capture of a [[Franc-Tireur]], by [[Carl Johann Lasch]].]]

The [[Geneva Conventions]] apply in wars between two or more [[sovereign state]]s. [[s:Third Geneva Convention#Article 5|Article 5]] of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] states that the status of a detainee may be determined by a "[[competent tribunal]]". Until such time, he must be treated as a [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter03/unlawful.html "Unlawful Combatants" in the United States: Drawing the Fine Line Between Law and War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014053851/http://www.abanet.org/irr/hr/winter03/unlawful.html |date=14 October 2009 }} [[Human Rights Magazine]] Winter 2003, published by the [[American Bar Association]]&lt;/ref&gt; After a "competent tribunal" has determined that an individual detainee is an unlawful combatant, the "detaining power" may choose to accord the detained unlawful combatant the rights and privileges of a prisoner of war as described in the Third Geneva Convention, but is not required to do so. An unlawful combatant who is not a national of a [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral state]], and who is not a national of a [[Co-belligerence|co-belligerent state]], retains rights and privileges under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] so that he must be "treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the [[Right to a fair trial|rights of fair and regular trial]]".&lt;ref name="icrc_dorman"&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_849_dorman.pdf The legal situation of unlawful/unprivileged combatants] (IRRC March 2003 Vol.85 No 849)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of an unlawful combatant is included in the Third Geneva Convention, the phrase itself does not appear in the document.&lt;ref name=ICRC-210705/&gt; Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention does describe categories under which a person may be entitled to POW status, and there are other international treaties that deny lawful combatant status for [[#Mercenaries|mercenaries]] and [[#Child soldiers|children]]. In the United States, the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] codified the legal definition of this term and invested the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] with broad [[discretion]] to determine whether a person may be designated an unlawful enemy combatant under [[United States law]]. The assumption that such a category as unlawful combatant exists is not contradicted by the findings of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] in the Celebici Judgment. The judgment quoted the 1958 [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) commentary on the Fourth Geneva Convention: Every person in enemy hands must be either a prisoner of war and, as such, be covered by the Third Convention; or a [[civilian]] covered by the Fourth Convention. Furthermore, "''There is no'' intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law",&lt;ref&gt;The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] "Celebici Judgment: Prosecutor v. Delalic, Mucic, Delic, and Landzo, Case No". [https://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/index-e.htm IT-96-21-T] seems to return the Appeal Judgment instead of the Trial Judgment. However, the relevant section of the Judgment is available from the [[University of the West of England]] [http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/part3B.htm Delalic et al. (I.T-96-21) "Celebici" 16 November 1998 Part III B, Applicable law 2. Status of the Victims as "Protected Persons". See: Para. 271] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230123702/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/part3B.htm |date=30 December 2005 }}:
:In addition, the evidence provided to the Trial Chamber does not indicate that the Bosnian Serbs who were detained were, as a group, at all times carrying their arms openly and observing the laws and customs of war. Article 4(A)(6) undoubtedly places a somewhat high burden on local populations to behave as if they were professional soldiers and the Trial Chamber, therefore, considers it more appropriate to treat all such persons in the present case as civilians.
:It is important, however, to note that this finding is predicated on the view that there is no gap between the Third and the Fourth Geneva Conventions. If an individual is not entitled to the protections of the Third Convention as a prisoner of war (or of the First or Second Conventions) he or she necessarily falls within the ambit of Convention IV, provided that its article 4 requirements are satisfied. The Commentary to the Fourth Geneva Convention asserts that;
::[e]very person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. ''There is no'' intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution – not only satisfying to the mind, but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view". [[Jean Pictet]] (ed.) – [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1958)] – 1994 reprint edition.&lt;/ref&gt; because in the opinion of the ICRC, "If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action".&lt;ref name=ICRC-210705/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geneva Conventions Protocol I"&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079 Geneva Conventions Protocol I] Article 51.3 also covers this interpretation "Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camp x-ray detainees.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camp X-Ray]], Guantánamo.]]
The Geneva Conventions do not recognize any lawful status for combatants in conflicts not involving two or more nation states. A state in such a conflict is legally bound only to observe Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and may ignore all of the other Articles. But each one of them is completely free to apply all or part of the remaining Articles of the Convention.&lt;ref name="icrc_Art3commentary"&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590006?OpenDocument Commentary for Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions]&lt;/ref&gt;

== International law and practice ==
The term "unlawful combatant" has been used for the past century in legal literature, military manuals, and case law.&lt;ref&gt;Knut Dörmann: "[http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList553/88140B29D25A47EFC1256D0B0046F105 The legal situation of unlawful/unprivileged combatants]". Article in the International Review of the ICRC, March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the terms "combatant", "prisoner of war", and "civilian", the term "unlawful combatant" is not mentioned in either the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague]] or the Geneva Conventions. So while the former terms are well understood and clear under international law, the term "unlawful combatant" is not.&lt;ref name="icrc_dorman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpcr.org/pdfs/OccasionalPaper2.pdf Warriors without rights? combatants, unprivileged belligerents, and the struggle over legitimacy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209160509/http://www.hpcr.org/pdfs/OccasionalPaper2.pdf |date=9 February 2006 }} by [[Kenneth Watkin]] for [http://www.hpcr.org/ The Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[First Hague Conference]], which opened on 6 May 1899, there was a disagreement between the [[Great Powers]]—which considered ''[[francs-tireurs]]'' unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture—and a group of small countries headed by Belgium—which opposed the very principle of the rights and duties of armies of occupation and demanded an unlimited right of resistance for the population of occupied territories. As a compromise, the Russian delegate, [[F. F. Martens]], proposed the [[Martens Clause]], which is included in the preamble to the ''1899 Hague Convention II – Laws and Customs of War on Land''. Similar wording has been incorporated into many subsequent treaties that cover extensions to humanitarian law.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ''[http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNHY The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict]'' 30 April 1997, ''International Review of the Red Cross'', no. 317, p.125-134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Pustogarov, ''[http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN52 Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845-1909) - a humanist of modern times]'', 30 June 1996 ''International Review of the Red Cross'', no. 312, p.300-314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague02.htm Laws of War: Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague II)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430220534/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague02.htm |date=30 April 2007 }}; 29 July 1899. contained in the [[Avalon Project]] archive at [[Yale Law School]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prisoners of war ===
{{main|Prisoners of war}}

The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, 12 August 1949 (GCIII) of 1949 defines the requirements for a captive to be eligible for treatment as a POW. A lawful combatant is a person who commits belligerent acts, and, when captured, is treated as a POW. An ''unlawful combatant'' is someone who commits belligerent acts but does not qualify for POW status under GCIII Articles 4 and 5.

{{quotation|Article 4
&lt;br&gt;
A. Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:

:1. Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces.

:2. Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]], belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]], provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfill the following conditions:

::(a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
::(b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;
::(c) That of carrying arms openly;
::(d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.

:3. Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.

:4. Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany, who shall provide them for that purpose with an identity card similar to the annexed model.

:5. Members of crews [of civil ships and aircraft], who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.

:6. Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.

B. The following shall likewise be treated as prisoners of war under the present Convention:

:1. Persons belonging, or having belonged, to the armed forces of the occupied country...

:...

Article 5

:...

:Should any doubt arise as to whether persons, having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.
}}

These terms thus divide combatants in a war zone into two classes: those in armies and organised militias and the like ('''lawful combatants'''), and those who are not. The critical distinction is that a "lawful combatant" (defined above) cannot be held personally responsible for violations of civilian laws that are permissible under the laws and customs of war; and if captured, a lawful combatant must be treated as a prisoner of war by the enemy under the conditions laid down in the Third Geneva Convention.

If there is any doubt about whether a detained alleged combatant is a "lawful combatant" then the combatant must be held as a prisoner of war until his or her status has been determined by "a competent tribunal".&lt;ref&gt;The ICRC [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument Commentary on Article 5] says on the issue of ''competent tribunal'' that "At Geneva in 1949, it was first proposed that for the sake of precision the term 'responsible authority' should be replaced by 'military tribunal' (11). This amendment was based on the view that decisions which might have the gravest consequences should Hot {{sic}} be left to a single person, who might often be of subordinate rank. The matter should be taken to a court, as persons taking part in the fight without the right to do may be prosecuted for murder or attempted murder, and might even be sentenced to capital punishment (12). This suggestion was not unanimously accepted, however, as it was felt that to bring a person before a military tribunal might have more serious consequences than a decision to deprive him of the benefits afforded by the Convention (13). A further amendment was therefore made to the Stockholm text stipulating that a decision regarding persons whose status was in doubt would be taken by a 'competent tribunal', and not specifically a military tribunal.&lt;br&gt;
Another change was made in the text of the paragraph, as drafted at Stockholm, in order to specify that it applies to cases of doubt as to whether persons having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4 (14). The clarification contained in Article 4 should, of course, reduce the number of doubtful cases in any future conflict.&lt;br&gt;
It therefore seems to us that this provision should not be interpreted too restrictively; the reference in the Convention to 'a belligerent act' relates to the principle which motivated the person who committed it, and not merely the manner in which the act was committed".

&lt;/ref&gt; If that tribunal rules that a combatant is an "unlawful combatant" then the person's status changes to that of a civilian which may give them some rights under the Fourth Geneva Convention.&lt;ref name="bpg"&gt;[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/usa/pow-bck.htm#P56_11515 Background Paper on Geneva Conventions and Persons Held by U.S. Forces] by "[[Human Rights Watch]] Press" footnote 1: International Committee of the Red Cross, ''Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' (Geneva: 1958), p. 51 (emphasis in original). The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, charged with prosecuting war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the recent conflicts in the Balkans, has explicitly affirmed this principle in a 1998 judgment, stating that "there is no gap between the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions.  If an individual is not entitled to the protection of the Third Convention as a prisoner of war ... he or she necessarily falls within the ambit of [the Fourth Convention], provided that its article 4 requirements [defining a protected person] are satisfied". Celebici Judgment, para. 271 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Persons who are not prisoners of war in an international conflict ====
A civilian "in the hands" of the enemy often gains rights through the ''Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'', 12 August 1949 (GCIV), if they qualify as a "protected person".

{{quotation|Article 4. Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected by it. Nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are.
}}
If the individual fulfills the criteria as a protected person, they are entitled to all the protections mentioned in GCIV. It should be emphasised that, in a war zone, a national of a neutral state, with normal diplomatic representation, is not a protected person under GCIV.

If a combatant does not qualify as a POW, then, if they qualify as a protected person, they receive all the rights which a non-combatant civilian receives under GCIV, but the party to the conflict may invoke Articles of GCIV to curtail those rights. The relevant Articles are 5 and 42.

{{quotation|Part I. General Provisions
:...
Art. 5 Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention as would, if exercised in the favour of such individual person, be prejudicial to the security of such State.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Where in occupied territory an individual protected person is detained as a [[espionage|spy]] or [[saboteur]], or as a person under definite suspicion of activity hostile to the security of the Occupying Power, such person shall, in those cases where absolute military security so requires, be regarded as having forfeited rights of communication under the present Convention.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention. They shall also be granted the full rights and privileges of a protected person under the present Convention at the earliest date consistent with the security of the State or Occupying Power, as the case may be.
:...
Section II. Aliens in the territory of a party to the conflict
:...
Art. 42. The internment or placing in assigned residence of protected persons may be ordered only if the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary.
}}

It is likely that if a competent tribunal under GCIII Article 5 finds they are an ''unlawful combatant'', and if they are a protected person under GCIV, the Party to the conflict will invoke GCIV Article 5. In this case, the "unlawful combatant" does not have rights under the present Convention as granting them those rights would be prejudicial to the security of the concerned state. They do, however, retain the right "...to be treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention",&lt;ref&gt;GCIV, Art. 5, § 3&lt;/ref&gt;

If, after a ''fair and regular trial'', an individual is found guilty of a crime, they can be punished by whatever lawful methods are available to the party to the conflict.

If the party does not use Article 5 of GCIV, the party may invoke Article 42 of GCIV and use "internment" to detain the "unlawful combatant".

For those nations that have ratified [[Protocol I]] of the Geneva Conventions, are also bound by Article 45.3 of that protocol which curtails GCIV Article 5.&lt;ref name="icrc_dorman" /&gt;

{{quotation|Any person who has taken part in hostilities, who is not entitled to prisoner‑of‑war status and who does not benefit from more favourable treatment in accordance with the Fourth Convention shall have the right at all times to the protection of Article 75 of this Protocol. In occupied territory, any such person, unless he is held as a spy, shall also be entitled, notwithstanding Article 5 of the Fourth Convention, to his rights of communication under that Convention.}}

==== Persons who are not prisoners of war in an internal conflict ====
Civilians are covered by GCIV Article 3:
{{quotation|Article 3
:1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed ''[[hors de combat]]'' by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.
:...
:(d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.
:...
:The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention.
:...
}}

====Combatants who do not qualify for prisoner of war status====

If the combatant is engaged in "armed conflict not of an international character" then under the Article 3 of the general provisions of the Geneva Conventions they should be "treated humanely", and if tried "sentences must ... be pronounced by a regularly constituted court"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:First Geneva Convention#Article 3|Geneva Conventions Common Article 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last time that American and British unlawful combatants were executed, after "a regularly constituted court", was the [[Luanda Trial]] as mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/28/newsid_2520000/2520575.stm 1976 June 28: Death sentence for Angolan mercenaries] [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parole violation ===
A combatant who is a POW, and who is subsequently paroled on the condition that he will not take up arms against the belligerent power (or co-belligerent powers) that had held him as a prisoner, is considered a parole violator if he breaks said condition. He is regarded as guilty of a breach in the laws and customs of war, unless there are mitigating circumstances such as coercion by his state to break his parole. As with other combatants, he is still protected by the Third Geneva Convention (GCIII), until a competent tribunal finds him in violation of his parole.

The [[Geneva Convention (1929)]] made no mention of parole, but as it was supplemental to the Hague conventions, it relied on the wording of Hague to address this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/305?OpenDocument Commentary on the Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War]. Geneva, 27 July 1929&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of GCIII, 1949, decided to include a reference with some modification to parole, because during the Second World War, some belligerent countries did permit such release to some extent.&lt;ref name=ICRC-GCIII-21&gt;ICRC [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590027?OpenDocument Commentary on GCIII: Article 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 21 of GCIII (1949) reproduces the Articles 10 and 11 of the ''Hague IV: Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land'', 18 October 1907, but did not include Article 12, which provides: "Prisoners of war liberated on parole and recaptured bearing arms against the Government to whom they had pledged their honour, or against the allies of that Government, forfeit their right to be treated as prisoners of war, and can be brought before the courts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV)]; 18 October 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, contained in the commentary on GCIII: The only safeguard available to a parole violator—who has been coerced into fighting, and who has been recaptured by the Power that detained him previously—is contained in the procedural guarantees to which he is entitled, pursuant to Article 85 of GCIII.&lt;ref name=ICRC-GCIII-21/&gt;

In the opinion of Major Gary D. Brown, [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), this means that "[T]he Hague Convention specified that parole breakers would forfeit their right to be treated as prisoners of war if recaptured. The 1949 Geneva Convention is less direct on the issue. A recaptured parole violator under the Convention would be afforded the opportunity to defend himself against charges of parole breaking. In the interim, the accused violator would be entitled to P[o]W status".

Brown in June 1998 was Chief, International and Operational Law at Headquarters, United States Strategic Command, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercenaries===

Under Article 47 of Protocol I (Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts) it is stated in the first sentence "A [[mercenary]] shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war".

On 4 December 1989 the United Nations passed resolution 44/34 the ''International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries''. It entered into force on 20 October 2001 and is usually known as the [[UN Mercenary Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/44/a44r034.htm International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries] A/RES/44/34 72nd plenary meeting 4 December 1989 (UN Mercenary Convention) [http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/mercenaries.htm Entry into force: 20 October 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812182322/http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/44/a44r034.htm |date=12 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 2 makes it an offence to employ a mercenary and Article 3.1 states that "A mercenary, as defined in article 1 of the present Convention, who participates directly in hostilities or in a concerted act of violence, as the case may be, commits an offence for the purposes of the Convention".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/mercenaries.htm International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812182322/http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/44/a44r034.htm |date=12 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child soldiers===
{{main|Military use of children}}

The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], Article 38, (1989) proclaimed: "State parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons who have not attained the age of 15 years do not take a direct part in hostilities".

In a 2003 briefing&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2004/childsoldiers0104/  Child Soldier Use 2003: A Briefing for the 4th UN Security Council Open Debate on Children and Armed Conflict]  by Human Rights Watch.&lt;/ref&gt; for the 4th UN Security Council open debate on children and armed conflict by Human Rights Watch they state in their introduction that:
:In recent years progress has been made in developing a legal and policy framework for protecting children involved in armed conflict. The [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on children in armed conflict]], which came into force in February 2002, prohibits the direct use of any child under the age of 18 in armed conflict and prohibits all use of under-18s by non-state armed groups. By mid-December 2003, 67 states had ratified the Optional Protocol, including seven mentioned in this report (The seven are: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Philippines, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and Uganda). The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child had begun examining governments’ reports on steps taken to implement the Protocol. [Articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi), (e)(vii)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccnow.org/documents/FS-AMICC-ICCnChildRights.pdf?PHPSESSID=544c50d2523e5c46acc51db534ae7ccf The International Criminal Court and Children’s Rights] (PFD) by "The American Non Governmental Organizations Coalition for the International Criminal Court"  Page 1, Paragraph 3.&lt;/ref&gt; of] the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]] (1998) defines the recruitment of children under the age of 15 as a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2004/childsoldiers0104/1.htm Introduction] to A Briefing for the 4th UN Security Council Open Debate on Children and Armed Conflict by Human Rights Watch&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipal law==

===United States===
Two separate issues to be determined in evaluating the category "unlawful combatant" as applied by the government of the United States. One issue is whether such a category ''could'' exist without violating the Geneva Conventions, and if such a category does exist, what steps the United States executive branch needs to take to comply with [[municipal law]]s as interpreted by the judicial branch of the United States government.

====1942 Quirin case====
The term ''unlawful combatant'' has been used for the past century in legal literature, military manuals and case law.&lt;ref name="icrc_dorman" /&gt; The term "unlawful combatants" was first used in U.S. municipal law in a 1942 [[United States Supreme Court]] decision in the case ''[[Ex parte Quirin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0317_0001_ZS.html Ex Parte Quirin -n1- (Nos. 1-7CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA)] or [http://www.agh-attorneys.com/4_ex_parte_quirin.htm Ex Parte Quirin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223094221/http://www.agh-attorneys.com/4_ex_parte_quirin.htm |date=23 February 2006 }} or [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/quirin.html EX PARTE QUIRIN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219141121/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/quirin.html |date=19 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Supreme Court upheld the jurisdiction of a [[Military tribunals in the United States|U.S. military tribunal]] over the trial of eight German [[sabotage|saboteurs]] in the U.S. during [[World War II]]. This decision states:
{{quote|
By universal agreement and practice, the law of war draws a distinction between the armed forces and the peaceful populations of belligerent nations and also between those who are lawful and unlawful combatants. Lawful combatants are subject to capture and detention as prisoners of war by opposing military forces. '''Unlawful combatants''' are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful. The spy who secretly and without uniform passes the military lines of a belligerent in time of war, seeking to gather military information and communicate it to the enemy, or an [[enemy combatant]] who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war, but to be offenders against the law of war subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals.}}

The validity of this case, as basis for denying prisoners in the [[War on Terrorism]] protection by the Geneva Conventions, has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect.org/print/V13/1/fletcher-g.html War and the Constitution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212200408/http://www.prospect.org/print/V13/1/fletcher-g.html |date=12 February 2006 }} by George P.

Since the 1942 Quirin case, the U.S. signed and ratified the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which are, therefore, considered to be a part of U.S. federal law, in accordance with the [[Supremacy Clause]] in the Constitution of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State#II. Evaluation of the act of bombing according to municipal law]] Paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] invalidated this premise, in [[Hamdan v.

Congress addressed these issues in the Military Commissions Act of 2006, so that enemy combatants and unlawful enemy combatants might be tried under military commissions; however, on 12 June 2008, the Supreme Court ruled, in [[Boumediene v. Bush]], that Guantanamo Bay captives were entitled to access the U.S. justice system, and that the military commissions as constituted under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 fell short of what was required of a court under the United States constitution (see the section below for more details).

==== 2001 Presidential military order ====
In the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the United States Congress passed a resolution known as the ''[[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]]'' (AUMF) on 18 September 2001. In this, Congress invoked the [[War Powers Resolution]] and stated:
:That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.&lt;ref&gt;US Congress' joint resolution of 18 September 2001 [http://news.findlaw.com/wp/docs/terrorism/sjres23.es.html Authorization for Use of Military Force ("AUMF")]; public law 107-40, 115 Stat. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the authorization granted to him by Congress, on 13 November 2001, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] issued a Presidential Military Order: "[[Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism]]"&lt;ref&gt;President George W. Bush's Military Order of 13 November 2001: [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/11/print/20011113-27.html Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism]; 66 FR 57833 [http://www.law.uchicago.edu/tribunals/exec_order.html backup site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404073150/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/tribunals/exec_order.html |date=4 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed "individuals ... to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal|military tribunals]]", where such individuals are members of the organization known as al Qa'ida; or has conspired or committed acts of international terrorism, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security, foreign policy, or economy. The order also specifies that the detainees are to be treated humanely.

The length of time for which a detention of such individuals can continue before being tried by a military tribunal is not specified in the military order. The military order uses the term "detainees" to describe the individuals detained under the military order. The U.S. administration chooses to describe the detainees held under the military order as "'''illegal enemy combatants'''".

With the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], some lawyers in the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s Office of Legal Counsel and in the office of [[White House]] counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]] advised President Bush that he did not have to comply with the Geneva Conventions in handling detainees in the War on Terrorism. This applied not only to members of al Qa'ida but the entire [[Taliban]], because, they argued, Afghanistan was a "failed state".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/050214fa_fact6 Outsourcing torture: The secret history of America's "extraordinary rendition" program] by Jane Mayer [[The New Yorker]] Issue of 2005-02-14 Posted 2005-02-07 Paragraph 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite opposition from the U.S. [[State Department]], which warned against ignoring the Geneva Conventions, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] thenceforth began holding such individuals captured in Afghanistan under the military order and not under the usual conditions of Prisoners of War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/outsourcing-torture Outsourcing torture: The secret history of America's "extraordinary rendition" program] by Jane Mayer The New Yorker Issue of 2005-02-14 Posted 2005-02-07 Paragraph 34&lt;/ref&gt; For those U.S. citizens detained under the military order, U.S. officials, such as Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], argue that the urgency of the post-9/11 environment called for such tactics in administration's war against terrorism.

Most of the individuals detained by the U.S. military on the orders of the U.S. administration were initially captured in Afghanistan. The foreign detainees are held in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] established for the purpose at the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], [[Cuba]]. Guantanamo was chosen because, although it is under the ''de facto'' control of the United States administration, it is not a [[sovereignty|sovereign territory]] of the United States, and a previous Supreme Court ruling ''[[Johnson v. Eisentrager]]'' in 1950 had ruled that U.S. courts had no jurisdiction over enemy aliens held outside the USA.

In ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that "the U.S. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Naval Base, which the United States occupies under a lease and treaty recognizing Cuba's ultimate sovereignty, but giving this country complete jurisdiction and control for so long as it does not abandon the leased areas",&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=03-334 Rasul et al. v. Bush, President of the United States])&lt;/ref&gt; and that as the United States had complete jurisdiction, the federal courts have the authority under the federal ''habeas corpus'' statute to decide whether foreign nationals (non-U.S. citizens) held in Guantanamo Bay were rightfully imprisoned. This ruling largely overturned the judicial advantage for the U.S. administration of using the Naval Base that ''Johnson v. Eisentrager'' seemed to have conferred.

There have been a number of legal challenges made on behalf of the detainees held in Guantanamo Bay detention camp and in other places. These include:
* On 30 July 2002, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in Rasul v. Bush, that it did not have jurisdiction because Guantanamo Bay Naval Base is not a [[United States territory#Dependent areas of the United States|sovereign territory]] of the United States. This decision was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the decision, (along with a related case in March 2003 — see [[Al-Odah v. United States]]). ''Rasul v. Bush'' was appealed to the United States Supreme Court on 2 September 2003.
* On 10 November 2003, the United States Supreme Court announced that it would decide on appeals by Afghan war detainees who challenge their continued incarceration at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as being unlawful, (See [[Rasul v. Bush]]).
* On 10 January 2004, 175 members of both [[United Kingdom Parliament|houses of Parliament in the UK]] filed an ''[[amicus curiae|amici curiae]]'' brief to support the detainees' access to US jurisdiction.
* On 28 June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in ''Rasul v. Bush'' that detainees in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base could turn to U.S. courts to challenge their confinement, but can also be held without charges or trial.
* On 7 July 2004, In response to the Supreme Court ruling, the Pentagon announced that cases would be reviewed by military tribunals, in compliance with Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3867067.stm Q&amp;A: US Supreme Court Guantanamo ruling], BBC 8 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOD-News&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2005/01/sec-050119-dod01.htm DoD News: Combatant Status Review Tribunals Update] No. 057-05, 19 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 8 November 2004, a federal court halted the proceeding of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, 34, of Yemen. Hamdan was to be the first Guantanamo detainee tried before a military commission. Judge [[James Robertson (Judge)|James Robertson]] of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in ''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld''&lt;ref&gt;''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld'' [http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/gazette/2004/11/ruling-on-lawfulness-of-Guantanamo.php summary], [http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/04-1519.pdf full text (PDF File)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050401133200/http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/04-1519.pdf |date=1 April 2005 }} – U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, presiding Judge James Robertson&lt;/ref&gt; that no competent tribunal had found that Hamdan was not a prisoner of war under the Geneva Conventions.
* By 29 March 2005, all detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base had received hearings before Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The hearings resulted in the release of 38 detainees, and confirmed the ''enemy combatant'' status of 520 detainees.&lt;ref name=DOD-News/&gt; [[Reuters]] reported on 15 June 2005 only four detainees had been charged and that Joseph Margulies, one of the lawyers for the detainees said "The (reviews) are a sham ... They mock this nation's commitment to due process, and it is past time for this mockery to end".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=65514&amp;d=16&amp;m=6&amp;y=2005&amp;pix=world.jpg&amp;category=World Guantanamo inmates can be held 'in perpetuity'- US], Arab News, 16 June 2005. ([[Reuters]] report 15 June 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaser Hamdi]] was captured in [[Afghanistan]] in November 2001. He was taken to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, but was transferred to jails in Virginia and South Carolina after it became known that he was a U.S. citizen. On 23 September 2004, the United States Justice Department agreed to release Hamdi to [[Saudi Arabia]], where he is also a citizen, on the condition that he gave up his U.S. citizenship. The deal also bars Hamdi from visiting certain countries and to inform Saudi officials if he plans to leave the kingdom. He was a party to a Supreme Court decision ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'' which issued a decision on 28 June 2004, repudiating the U.S. government's unilateral assertion of executive authority to suspend the constitutional protections of individual liberty of a U.S. citizen. The Court recognized the power of the government to detain unlawful combatants, but ruled that detainees must have the ability to challenge their detention before an impartial judge. Though no single opinion of the Court commanded a majority, eight of the nine justices of the Court agreed that the [[Executive Branch]] does not have the power to hold indefinitely a U.S. citizen without basic due process protections enforceable through judicial review.

On 8 May 2002, [[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]], also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, was arrested by [[FBI]] agents at [[Chicago]]'s [[O'Hare International Airport]] and held as material witness on the warrant issued in [[New York State]] about the 2001 9/11 attacks. On 9 June 2002 President Bush issued an order to Secretary Rumsfeld to detain Padilla as an "enemy combatant". The order justified the detention by leaning on the AUMF which authorized the President to "use all necessary force against those nations, organizations, or ''persons''" and in the opinion of the administration a U.S. citizen can be an enemy combatant (this was decided by the United States Supreme Court in the case of ''Ex parte Quirin'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.syr.edu/academics/centers/insct/Military%20Force%20-%20Padilla.asp Authorization for Use of Military Force: Padilla v.

* The 13 November 2001, Military Order, mentioned above, exempts U.S. citizens from trial by military tribunals to determine if they are "unlawful combatants", which indicates that Padilla and ''Yaser Hamdi'' would end up in the civilian criminal justice system, as happened with [[John Walker Lindh]].
* On 18 December 2003, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals declared that the Bush Administration lacked the authority to detain a U.S. citizen arrested on U.S. soil as an "illegal enemy combatant" without clear congressional authorization (per {{usc|18|4001}}(a)); it consequently ordered the government to release Padilla from military custody within thirty days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1218-10.htm Appeals Court Says Bush Can't Hold U.S. Citizen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122053133/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1218-10.htm |date=22 January 2014 }} Published on Thursday, 18 December 2003 by [[Reuters]]&lt;/ref&gt; But agreed that he could be held until an appeal was heard.
* On 20 February 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the government's appeal.
* The Supreme Court heard the case, ''[[Rumsfeld v. Padilla]]'', in April 2004, but on 28 June it was thrown out on a technicality. The court declared that New York State, where the case was originally filed, was an improper venue and that the case should have been filed in South Carolina, where Padilla was being held.
* On 28 February 2005, in [[Spartanburg]], [[South Carolina]], U.S. District Judge [[Henry Floyd (judge)|Henry Floyd]] ordered the Bush administration to either charge Padilla or release him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/01/politics/01terror.html?ex=1111899600&amp;en=4bade73e4d6a651f&amp;ei=5070 Judge Says Terror Suspect Can't Be Held as an Enemy Combatant] The [[New York Times]] 1 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He relied on the Supreme Court's ruling in the parallel enemy combatant case of Yaser Hamdi (''Hamdi v. Rumsfeld''), in which the majority decision declared a "state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens".
* On 19 July 2005, in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals began hearing the government's appeal of the lower court (the District of South Carolina, at Charleston) ruling by Henry F. Floyd, District Judge, (CA-04-2221-26AJ). Their ruling, decided 9 September 2005, was that "the President does possess such authority pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution enacted by Congress in the wake of the attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed".&lt;ref&gt;José Padilla Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals 19 July, 9 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (29 June 2006) the U.S. Supreme Court did not rule on the subject of unlawful combatant status but did reaffirm that the U.S. is bound by the Geneva Conventions. Most notably it said that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, regarding the treatment of detainees, applies to all prisoners in the War on Terror.

====Combatant Status Review Tribunal====
{{wikisource|Combatant Status Review Tribunal (fact sheet of 17 October 2006)}}

Following the ''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld''-ruling (November 2004) the Bush administration has begun using Combatant Status Review Tribunals to determine the status of detainees. By doing so the obligation under Article 5 of the GCIII was to be addressed.

However, critics maintain these CSRTs are inadequate to warrant acceptance as "competent tribunal". Their principal arguments are:
* The CSRT conducted rudimentary proceedings
* The CSRT afforded detainees few basic protections
* Many detainees lacked counsel
* The CSRT also informed detainees only of general charges against them, while the details on which the CSRT premised enemy combatant status decisions were classified.
* Detainees had no right to present witnesses or to cross-examine government witnesses.
Notable cases pointed to by critics as demonstrating the flawed nature of the procedure include: [[Mustafa Ait Idir]], [[Moazzam Begg]], [[Murat Kurnaz]], [[Feroz Abbasi]], and [[Martin Mubanga]]. A comment by legal experts states:
:It appears ... that the procedures of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals do not qualify as status determination under the Third Geneva Convention. &lt;......&gt; The fact that no status determination had taken place according to the Third Geneva Convention was sufficient reason for a judge from the District Court of Columbia dealing with a habeas petition, to stay proceedings before a military commission. Judge Robertson in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld held that the Third Geneva Convention, which he considered selfexecuting, had not been complied with since a Combatant Status Review Tribunal could not be considered a ‘competent tribunal’ pursuant to article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/publish/articles/000003/article.pdf Guantánamo Bay: A Reflection On The Legal Status And Rights Of ‘Unlawful Enemy Combatants’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218001849/http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/publish/articles/000003/article.pdf |date=18 February 2006 }} [[PDF]] by Terry Gill and Elies van Sliedregt in the [http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/ Utrecht Law Review] or  &lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Crisfield]], the legal advisor to the Tribunals, offered his legal opinion, that CSRT "do not have the discretion to determine that a detainee should be classified as a prisoner of war — only whether the detainee satisfies the definition of 'enemy combatant'".&lt;ref name=ApCsrt&gt;[http://wid.ap.org/documents/detainees/moazzambegg.pdf Moazzam Begg's dossier (.pdf)] from his Combatant Status Review Tribunal, hosted by [[Associated Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Determining whether a captive should be classified as a prisoner of war is the sole purpose of a competent tribunal.

Analysis of these Tribunals by two lawyers for Guananamo detainees, Professor [[Mark P. Denbeaux]] of the [[Seton Hall University School of Law]], his son [[Joshua Denbeaux]], and some of his law students resulted in a report called ''[[No-hearing hearings]]''. In essence it supports the criticism voiced above.&lt;ref name="No-hearing_hearings"&gt;[http://law.shu.edu/news/final_no_hearing_hearings_report.pdf No-hearing hearings] by, Mark Denbeaux, Professor, Seton Hall University School of Law and Counsel to two Guantanamo detainees, Joshua Denbeaux, Esq. and David Gratz, John Gregorek, Matthew Darby, Shana Edwards, Shane Hartman, Daniel Mann, Megan Sassaman and Helen Skinner

====Military commissions====
{{Main|Military Commissions Act of 2006}}

As of 17 October 2006, when President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 into law, Title 10 of the United States Code was amended to include a definition of an "unlawful enemy combatant" as

{{quotation|a person who has engaged in hostilities or who has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the [[United States]] or its co-belligerents who is not a lawful enemy combatant (including a person who is part of the [[Taliban]], [[al-Qaida]], or associated forces); or a person who, before, on, or after the date of the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, has been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense.}}

The definition of a lawful enemy combatant is also given, and much of the rest of the law sets out the specific procedures for determining whether a given detainee of the U.S. armed forces is an unlawful enemy combatant and how such combatants may or may not be treated in general and tried for their crimes in particular. Among its more controversial provisions, the law stipulates that a non United States citizen held as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination may not seek [[habeas corpus]] relief. Such detainees must simply wait until the military convene a detainee status review tribunal (under the procedures described in the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]]).

Immediately after Bush signed the Act into law, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] notified the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] that the Court no longer had jurisdiction over a combined ''habeas'' case that it had been considering since 2004. A notice dated the following day listed 196 other pending habeas cases for which it made the same claim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/19/AR2006101901692.html?nav=rss_nation/special "Court Told It Lacks Power in Detainee Cases", ''Washington Post'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the first three war crimes cases brought against Guantanamo Bay detainees under the Military Commissions Act, one resulted in a [[plea bargain]] and the two others were dismissed on [[jurisdiction]]al grounds.

On 4 June 2007, in two separate cases, military tribunals dismissed charges against detainees who had been designated as "enemy combatants" but not as "unlawful enemy combatants". The first case was that of [[Omar Khadr]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] who had been designated as an "enemy combatant" in 2004. Khadr was accused of throwing a grenade during a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002. [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Peter Brownback]] ruled that the military tribunals, created to deal with "unlawful enemy combatants", had no jurisdiction over detainees who had been designated only as "enemy combatants". He dismissed without prejudice all charges against Khadr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Koring |first=Paul |title=U.S. case against Khadr collapses |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail|Toronto Globe and Mail]] |year=2007 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070604.wkhadr0604_1/BNStory/International/home |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606204940/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070604.wkhadr0604_1/BNStory/International/home |archivedate=6 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on 4 June, [[Captain (U.S. Navy)|Captain]] [[Keith J.

The [[United States Department of Defense]] responded by stating: "We believe that Congress intended to grant jurisdiction under the Military Commissions Act to individuals, like Mr. Khadr, who are being held as enemy combatants under existing C.S.R.T. procedures". That position was called "dead wrong" by Specter.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote in the majority opinion:
{{quotation|The laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times.}}

The Court also ruled that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were "inadequate".&lt;ref name=AssociatedPress20080612-a/&gt; [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Stephen Breyer]], [[David Souter]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] joined Kennedy in the majority.

[[Samuel Alito]], [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Antonin Scalia]] joined Roberts in the dissent.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMail20080612/&gt;

[[Vincent Warren]], the executive director of the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], the organization that initiated the action that triggered the Supreme Court ruling responded:&lt;ref name=BaltimoreSun20080612/&gt;
{{quotation|The Supreme Court has finally brought an end to one of our nation's most egregious injustices. It has finally given the men held at Guantanamo the justice that they have long deserved.

This six-year-long nightmare is a lesson in how fragile our constitutional protections truly are in the hands of an overzealous executive.}}

====2009====

In January and February 2009, President [[Barack Obama]]'s nominees for [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]], [[Eric Holder]] and [[Elena Kagan]], both testified they agreed the U.S. government may detain combatants in accordance with the laws of war until the end of the war, (this sidesteps the issue of deciding whether the combatant is a lawful or unlawful combatant and the need to try them). When asked by [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Lindsey Graham]] "If our intelligence agencies should capture someone in the Philippines that is suspected of financing Al Qaeda worldwide, would you consider that person part of the battlefield?" Both Holder and Kagan said that they would.&lt;ref name="LAT2009feb11sg"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-solicitor-general11-2009feb11,0,7158432.story Solicitor general nominee says 'enemy combatants' can be held without trial], [[Los Angeles Times]], 11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evan Perez.

The United Kingdom [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) makes the distinction. The CPS conducted a "through review of the evidence concerning the deaths of Sergeant Steven Roberts of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment and Mr Zaher Zaher, an Iraqi national, at Az Zubayr, Iraq on 24 March 2003":&lt;ref name=CPS-2006&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_releases/123_06/ CPS decision on Iraq deaths case : Press Release : Crown Prosecution Service] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926174926/http://cps.gov.uk/news/press_releases/123_06/ |date=26 September 2010 }}, 27 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/sgtroberts31_07_06.pdf British Army Board of Inquiry into death of Sgt Steven Roberts], 31 July 2007, website of the BBC.  See paragraph 61 for details of British Rules of Engagement in the [[Iraq War]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In reviewing the case, the CPS lawyer considered the possible view that, because of his behaviour, Mr Zaher had become an unlawful combatant and therefore under the Rules of Engagement, under which the [British] soldiers were required to operate, they would have been entitled to take offensive action against him. Under the Rules of Engagement and the Geneva Convention, unless a person is positively identified as being a combatant, they should be considered a civilian and treated accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As the alternative view would be that Mr Zaher was not an unlawful combatant but a civilian, the reviewing lawyer also considered whether the soldiers could rely on self defence. ...|Crown Prosecution Service.&lt;ref name=CPS-2006/&gt;}}

== International criticism of unlawful combatant status ==
The designation of some prisoners as "unlawful combatants", has been the subject of criticism by international human rights institutions; including [[Amnesty International]], Human Rights Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In response to the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, a legal advisor at the Legal Division of the ICRC, published a paper on the subject,&lt;ref name="icrc_dorman" /&gt; in which it states:
:Whereas the terms "combatant" "prisoner of war" and "civilian" are generally used and defined in the treaties of international humanitarian law, the terms "unlawful combatant", "unprivileged combatants/belligerents" do not appear in them. They have, however, been frequently used at least since the beginning of the last century in legal literature, military manuals and case law. The connotations given to these terms and their consequences for the applicable protection regime are not always very clear.

Human Rights Watch have pointed out that in a judgement, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia interpreted the International Committee of the Red Cross, ''Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' (Geneva: 1958) to mean that:
:there is no gap between the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions. If an individual is not entitled to the protection of the Third Convention as a prisoner of war ... he or she necessarily falls within the ambit of [the Fourth Convention], provided that its article 4 requirements [defining a protected person] are satisfied.&lt;ref name="bpg" /&gt;

This does not mean that the status of unlawful combatant does not exist because in the opinion of the ICRC "If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents ... [and] They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action".&lt;ref name=ICRC-210705/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geneva Conventions Protocol I"/&gt;

Critics of the U.S. internment at Guantanamo Bay worry that the introduction of the ''unlawful combatant'' status sets a dangerous precedent for other regimes to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv |last=Elsea |first=Jennifer |url=https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL31367.pdf |title=Treatment of "Battlefield Detainees" in the War on Terrorism |publisher=American Law Division CRS Report for Congress, Order Code RL31367|origyear=11 April 2002 |date=13 January 2005|page=41 (CRS–38)}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the government of [[Liberia]] detained American activist [[Hassan Bility]] in 2002, Liberian authorities dismissed the complaints&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2002/11718.htm Comments on the Arrest and Detention of Journalist Hassan Bility in Liberia] Press Statement by Richard Boucher, Spokesman in the U.S [[State Department]], 8 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; of the United States, responding that he had been detained as an unlawful combatant.

'''''Warth v. Seldin''''', 422 U.S. 490 (1975), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court reviewed the concept of judicial standing and affirmed that if the plaintiffs lacked [[standing (law)|standing]],  they could not maintain a case against the defendants.

== Background ==
The [[plaintiffs]] brought action against the town of [[Penfield, New York]], a suburb of  [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and against members of the Zoning, Planning, and Town Boards of Penfield, alleging that Penfield's zoning ordinances intentionally and wrongly excluded persons of low and moderate income from living there.  

The not-for-profit housing organization Metro-Act of Rochester joined with several Rochester taxpayers as well as low and moderate-income individuals of various racial and ethnic backgrounds were considered jointly as party-plaintiffs to this action. However, the  [[United States District Court]] dismissed the case, citing that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue. The [[United States Court of Appeals]] affirmed the dismissal.

The court was tasked to determine if the [[United States|American]] rules of standing should be considered part of the 'case or controversy' clause of [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] or, apart from that, if the court can hear cases on "generalized grievances" or in the interest of third parties where none of the complainants have standing.

== Opinion of the Court ==
The Court found that as none of the plaintiffs could demonstrate any injury actually done to them by the defendants,  the plaintiffs were third parties to the issue and had no standing to sue.   The plaintiff's descriptions of their own meager financial situations and subsequent inability to live in Penfield were found by the Court to be the consequence of the economics and housing market of the area rather than any wrongdoing by the defendants.
