'''''Aa Ab Laut Chalen''''' (translation: ''Come, Let's Go Back'') is a [[Bollywood films of 1999|1999]] Indian [[Bollywood|Hindi]] [[romantic drama film|romantic drama]] [[musical film|musical]] directed by [[Rishi Kapoor]], making his directorial debut and also remains the only film he had directed in his career. The film's script was written by [[Sachin Bhowmick]] and Rumi Jaffery. The film premiered in India and the United States on 22 January 1999. It starred [[Akshaye Khanna]], [[Rajesh Khanna]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]] and was the last production of [[R. K. Films]].

==Plot==
Rohan Khanna ([[Akshaye Khanna]]) is a jobless graduate living with his grandfather ([[Alok Nath]]) and his mother ([[Moushumi Chatterjee]]). Rohan has been tirelessly looking for a decent job without success. One day, Rohan's neighbour, Ranjit arrives from [[America]], where he co-owns and runs a motel and is married to a white woman of European descent. Ranjit suggests that Rohan should also move to America and find a white European woman to marry and settle with.  

Rohan is immediately persuaded and prepares his visa/paperwork with Ranjit as his sponsor. At this point, his mother reminds him of his late father, Balraj ([[Rajesh Khanna]]), who had similar dreams of settling in USA and left her and Rohan alone in India with nobody to look after them.

Rohan settles in his new life in USA and enjoys it immensely for many months, but he notices Ranjit is increasingly abusive towards his own parents and places them in a nursing home and the old aging parents always face verbal abuse from him and his European white wife. Also, Rohan notices that Ranjit becomes increasingly indifferent towards him and his needs, asking him to move out of his house and apartment with little notice.  

Later, Rohan luckily meets Sardar Khan ([[Kader Khan]]), a Pakistani man who earns his living as a taxi-cab driver, who is immensely impressed by Rohan's good manners and friendly personality.  Sardar offers Rohan a place to stay,sharing the room with '''Iqbal Singh''' ([[Jaspal Bhatti]]), a Punjabi man from India and also offers him a  temporary job as a taxi-cab driver. Rohan moves in and makes new friends easily. 

One fine day, Rohan in his job as a taxi driver, meets a young Indian woman named Pooja ([[Aishwarya Rai]]) at the airport and they become friends. Later on, Pooja confides in Rohan her sad story of how her brother disappointed her by calling her to visit him in USA and hooks her up to marry his European boss who is a womaniser, without her consent.

Taking pity on her sad plight, Rohan offers to share his room with her, with the permission of Sardar Khan and the Punjabi tenant who also shared the apartment. All of them welcome the couple, Pooja and Rohan, who are now deeply in love.

Sardar Khan helps the couple to find odd jobs in fast food joints, laundromats, restaurants and gas stations, etc. where they can earn some money, and Rohan is always protective of Pooja and seldom allows her to travel alone or too far. 

After a few years of doing these odd jobs, Rohan is tired of it all and wants to do something bigger to earn more money and he is advised by his friend Sardar Khan to approach Mr. Chaurasia (an influential Indian in the jurisdiction).  Chaurasia advises Rohan to get a [[Permanent residence (United States)|Green Card]] by marrying (on agreement) an [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]] girl and once he gets the '''Green Card''' he can file for divorce. Chaurasia agrees to be their referee and sponsor.

Rohan and Pooja start looking for women who are ready to do this legal paperwork - and after a long search they meet  seductive Loveleen ([[Suman Ranganathan]]) and after Rohan marries (files legal paperwork for civil marriage) her, he forgets Pooja completely, much to her dismay. Rohan becomes so hopelessly tempted by the beautiful Loveleem that he gets aggravated with his old friends and moves into a luxurious mansion provided by the wealthy Loveleen - and warns his friends to stay away from him. Sardar tries to warn  him not to be consumed by his greed for luxury and women. Rohan tells them that they are envious of his progress. 

In order to move on and to forget Rohan, Pooja finds a job as a caretaker/maid  for a rich Indian man Balraj, who is ill and aging, and also bed-ridden most of the time.  Pooja does not know that this is the Balraj - who had selfishly left India years ago, leaving his wife and his son Rohan alone to fend for themselves.

Pooja meets Balraj's son Karan, whose mother had deserted Balraj when Karan was a baby boy.  Therefore, Karan has grown to be a spoiled and arrogant young man, who is also friends with Loveleen (now Rohan's arranged  legal wife). Karan consistently asks his father for money to spend for his enjoyment. He even took a huge loan from Marko, a dangerous drug dealer and to re-pay  his debts, he is assigned to transport drugs around the country.

Balraj takes a liking to Pooja and considers her as a daughter. He wants to keep her in his home so he asks her to consider marrying Karan. 

Meanwhile, Rohan begins to realise that Loveleen's American culture deeply goes against his. He gets fed up with her ways and realises he is really in love with Pooja. He leaves Loveleen and goes back to Sardar and his friends and they tell him that Pooja now works as a caretaker for an old man called Balraj in Springfield meadow mansion.

Rohan sets out to ask Pooja for forgiveness where he finds her with the old sick man Balraj.  Rohan tries to convince her to return to India and this is where the title song comes in.

Pooja agrees to do this, and as they part Rohan gives her a locket with a picture of his mother inside, saying that it is a token of promise that he will marry her. Pooja tells all this to Balraj (as she considers him to be a father figure by now) that she has fallen in love with a man named Rohan, and he encourages her as Rohan seemed like a nice guy. 

Meanwhile, Karan, being arrogant and spoilt, wishes to marry Pooja. He is always violently man-handling her in the house and threatening her that he will continue to treat her like a servant until and unless she succumbs to his desires. After violently urging her to marry him, her locket falls on the ground and Balraj picks it up. 

Balraj opens the locket and he is surprised to see his wife's picture inside it! After Pooja explains about the locket to him, he realises that Rohan is his son but does not tell Pooja immediately as he fears that Rohan might not accept him as a father in his hostility (and Karan might get more envious). 

After hearing from Pooja that Rohan is struggling to make ends meet, Balraj asks Pooja to call Rohan for an interview to his company for a Manager position, for which Rohan passes and is offered a well-paying job and career at last! Rohan expresses his gratitude for the opportunity and then Balraj continues his generosity from afar by giving Rohan a $5000 bonus, and anything he wishes for. 

After a few years, Rohan goes to visit Ranjit's poor abused parents and offers some help because he knows Ranjit is ignoring them all the time. Rohan pays for the parents Nursing home rent charges as well as their ticket to return to India as the parents wished to return to their homeland. After this, Pooja and Rohan continue to live a happy life in USA and plan to return to India after some time.

Just before their departure, Balraj confesses to Rohan that  he is indeed his long-lost son and that he had kept this secret from him fearing a hostile unacceptance of help from his part!

Rohan is stunned to realise that Balraj is his father and reacts in anger. Balraj continues to explain that  after he arrived in America, he went back to India to find his family, but he could not, so he remarried. Balraj insists to speak to his wife to ask for forgiveness. She immediately forgives him and asks them all to come back to India. 

Finally, they are all united as one big happy family, including Karan, who is acquitted of his charges because he helps the Police find out and arrest Marko the drug dealer.

'''''Anatomy of Murder''''' is a 2015 Australian whodunnit video game as the debut work of Darren McNamara's company DM Financial Services. According to McNamara it is the first free-to-play online murder mystery game.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-first-online-murder-mystery-gives-players-the-opportunity-to-win-250000-dollars-300072173.html|title=World's First Online Murder Mystery Gives Players the Opportunity to Win 250,000 Dollars|last=Murder|first=DM Financial Services Pty Limited on behalf of Anatomy of|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

=== Conception ===
The game was developed by DM Financial Services, a company focusing on producing original and engaging online gaming content.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardgeek.com/article/Worlds-First-Online-Murder-Mystery-Gives-Players-the-Opportunity-to-Win-250000-Dollars-20150427|title=World's First Online Murder Mystery Gives Players the Opportunity to Win 250,000 Dollars|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by online gaming entrepreneur Darren McNamara, ''Anatomy of Murder'' was the result of over 13 years of extensive R&amp;D.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McNamara faced considerable resistance from the entertainment industry regarding the format, the production values, and for spending too much money.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2013/10/anatomy-of-murder-online-focus-group.html|title=Anatomy of Murder: online focus group|date=2013-10-13|work=TV Tonight|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he received feedback from a network that they wanted to be involved in comissioning a series from the ground up rather than being shown a finished pilot they didn't order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He chose to go ahead and create the game because he felt it showed how much he believed in the concept more than a "4 page glossy".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He originally received few knockbacks from TV executives In 2013, so he instead went outside the box and approached audiences directly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In October 2013, ''TV Tonight'' readers were asked to participate in an online focus group for the game, in order to provide McNamara with some feedback on his pitch.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was keen to see the concept being picked up in the Australian market before trying to sell it to the United States in addition he hoped to take the format to MIPTV in April 2014.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''Anatomy of Murder'' was released two years later in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Design ===
The game's narrative was conveyed through 2 produced episodes at 45 minutes each.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A third episode was also produced which revealed the killer and the clues in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502145719/http://www.anatomyofmurder.com:80/shop.html|title=Shop|date=2015-05-02|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNamara designed the format, produced the 3 episodes and built the website himself.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to the lack of budget, McNamara was not able to improve the script, the production and the trailer to his standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All of the information required to solve the murder was contained within those two episodes, as well as information at the game's website ([http://www.anatomyofmurder.com/ www.anatomyofmurder.com]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A cash prize of AU$250,000 was made available to the first player able to solve the crime.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The game could be played from phones, tablets or desktop computers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Players had to choose from nine possible killers and ten potential motives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to McNamara, it is notable for being the first free-to-play online murder mystery game&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;; he believes in the game's uniqueness as the format has been registered with FRAPA since 2007, and he has not come across any TV shows or DVD/Website/SMS games similar to ''Anatomy of Murder.''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The prize amount was changed to $100,000 some time during its development.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014173143/http://www.anatomyofmurder.com/|title=Index|date=2016-10-14|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was to be announced on Christmas Day 2016.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A series of 20 clues were released onto the website leading up to that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130030446/http://www.anatomyofmurder.com:80/clues.html|title=Clues|date=2015-11-30|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
As of April 2015, ''Anatomy of Murder 2'' is in the works.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of October 2016, the sequel was set to start production in April 2017, with website members offered an audition.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; McNamara hoped to up the budget for this series in order to improve the quality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His goal was to produce between 2 and 3 series a year, with the story arcing across the whole season or between seasons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While only one person would win the major prize, there would be smaller additional prizes along the way.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Andare''' ({{lang-si|අන්දරේ}}) from ''Udamalala'', [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]] was a [[court jester]] employed by the [[Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy|King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe]] (1742 - 1782) in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andare - the court jester of medieval Sri Lanka|url=http://www.island.lk/2010/03/09/opinion5.html|work=The Island, Sri Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used to be an accomplished poet who could instantly compose verses, to suit  any ongoing situation. Despite being a mere joker, the tales suggest Andare had a superior intellect that aided him in turning situations to his favour. After his death he was buried in the town of Udamalala, allegedly his hometown, where is tomb can be found on the banks of the ''Udamalala wewa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andare – Sri Lanka’s beloved jester|url=https://www.timeout.com/sri-lanka/sri-lanka-blog/andare-sri-lankas-beloved-jester-020116|work=timeout.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animecon''' is [[anime convention]] in [[Finland]], held annually over a weekend in varying Finnish cities.

Animecon was organized as a joint project between anime clubs throughout Finland, facilitated by the communications hub Suomen Animeunioni ''(The Finnish Anime Union)''.&lt;ref name="Anime-01"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Eturautti |first=Kyuu |year=2005 |title=Kotimaan katsaus ''(A domestic look)'' |magazine=Anime magazine |issue=01 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention was first established in 1999 as an outgrowth of the [[science fiction]] [[anime]] [[fandom]] of the [[sci-fi convention]] [[Finncon]],&lt;ref name="Anime-13"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Joukamaa |first=Mauno |year=2006 |title=Animecon: Kuinka kaikki alkoi ''(Animecon: How it all began)'' |magazine=Anime magazine |issue=13 |page=08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expanded into a separate event about anime in general. Animecon and Finncon have been held in conjunction, sharing premises but no events; they even often held separate opening ceremonies. In 2012 Animecon was held at Kuopio for a first time and the convention has remained there since then.

The two drew some 5200 visitors in 2004&lt;ref name="Turun2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kulttuuri/?ts=1,3:1005:0:0,4:5:0:1:2004-07-14,104:5:237431,1:0:0:0:0:0: |title=Jyväskylän Kesä veti väkeä |date=2004-07-14 |accessdate=2007-09-03 |work=[[Turun Sanomat]] |language=Finnish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204917/http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kulttuuri/?ts=1%2C3%3A1005%3A0%3A0%2C4%3A5%3A0%3A1%3A2004-07-14%2C104%3A5%3A237431%2C1%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A |archivedate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5500 in 2006{{fact|date=August 2008}}, peaking at 5000 on Saturday during the three-day event.&lt;ref name="Anime-14"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Eturautti |first=Kyuu |year=2006 |title=Tervetuloa coniin!

'''''Ankh''''' is a [[point-and-click]] 3D [[adventure game]] by [[Deck13 Interactive]] released in 2005 for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It features a three-dimensional environment with cinematic camera movement. It features voice acting. Humor is an important aspect of the game, and the influence of classic [[LucasArts]] adventure games is noticeable. ''Ankh'' is a remake of '''''Ankh: The Tales of Mystery''''', a 1998 adventure game developed by Artex Software for the [[Acorn Archimedes]]. ''Ankh'' was ported to [[Linux]] and [[macOS|OS X]] in 2006. A Special Edition of the game was released in the UK in February 2007.&lt;ref name="Ankh-SE"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013111236fw_/http://bhvftp.com:80/www/xider.com/english/news/ankhspecialedition.html |title=Xider launches a Special Edition of "Ankh" in the UK |author= |date=February 16, 2007 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nintendo DS]] port was released in 2008 under the title '''''Ankh: Curse of the Scarab King'''''.

==Plot==
The player takes the role of Assil, the son of a respected architect in Cairo. Assil is a party animal but at some point one of his party-nights turned out sour. When he tries to have some fun in the pyramids with two friends of his, he accidentally breaks some urns and thus disturbs the mummy resting in the pyramid. The mummy punishes Assil by placing a death curse on him, and now he has 24 hours to remove the curse and save himself. Later in the game Assil meets the Arabian ambassador's daughter Thara, who is also a playable character.

Jan Klose, Creative Director at Deck13 Interactive, also cited ''Monkey Island'' to be an influence for the ''Ankh'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barton |first=Matt |url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/334/ |title=Jan Klose - Deck 13 Interactive |publisher=[[Adventure Classic Gaming]] |date=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Antidosis''''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀντίδοσις}}), is the title of a speech treatise by the ancient Greek [[rhetoric]]ian, [[Isocrates]].  The ''Antidosis'' can be viewed as a defense, an [[autobiography]], or rhetorical treatise. However, since Isocrates wrote it when he was 82 years old, it is generally seen by some people as an autobiography.  The title literally translates as “an exchange,” and was applied in ancient [[Greece|Greek]] courts as a peculiar law pertaining to an exchange of estates between two parties.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_law_glossary?page=5&amp;greekEncoding= ''Antidosis'' as an Ancient Athenian legal term]&lt;/ref&gt;  If one of the 1200 wealthiest Athenians eligible was tasked with the performance of a public liturgy and financing one of the many public concerns of [[Athens]], then he could avoid the duty by nominating a richer man who was more qualified than himself to perform it.  If the supposedly richer man disagreed with the terms, then the entirety of their estates would be exchanged and the now more wealthy man would have to perform the [[liturgy]], as originally planned.  The law inspired Isocrates' ''Antidosis'', which was written in the form of a [[Legal case|court case]] where Isocrates had to defend himself from a charge of corrupting the youth by teaching them how to speak well in order for them to gain an unfair advantage over their peers.  Although this work is put forward by Isocrates as his imagined defense in a legal case, it is more a treatise on [[morality]] and teaching.

== As a Court Case ==
Although it is assumed that he is defending himself from a charge of corrupting the youth, nowhere in his Antidosis does Isocrates mention what [[crime]] he is charged with and from which he must defend, nor does it say what the penalty would be for being found guilty.  Isocrates also does not make any attempt to offer evidence in his favor, yet presents the defense that he is a good [[teacher]] to his students as the full defense for the crime that he has committed.  There is no specific mention of anything that would prove him innocent in this particular case.

Another idea by scholars is that early on in the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates reads aloud that he is being indicted for corrupting his students.  He is accused of educating his students to speak against the courts, question the laws, and think for themselves.  Isocrates says, “Here is the indictment my accuser endeavors to vilify me, charging that I corrupt young men by teaching them to speak and gain their won advantage in the courts contrary to justice…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Isocrates is being charged by Lysimachus who has accused Isocrates of receiving money from his students.  In return, Isocrates has been teaching them how to become better public speakers and leaders.  Isocrates proves his innocence by showing, that through teaching his students rhetoric, he is teaching them how to become better citizens and leaders of Athens.  Isocrates proved his rationale by citing the accomplishments and devotion to the state his students displayed after being educated by him.  Isocrates says in his defense, “But, I beg of you, consider well whether I appear to you to corrupt the young by my words, or, on the contrary, to inspire them to a life of valor and of dangers endured for their country…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  B. Keith Murphy says of Isocrates’s defense, “For Isocrates, it is through rhetoric that we can approximate truth, or at least a consensual truth. A man who is trained in rhetoric is trained in truth, and the creation of that truth through oratory.”&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, B. Keith. "Isocrates." Salem Press, 1998. Web. 29 Apr 2011. &lt;http://www.keithmurphy.info/399/Isoc.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the sense that he is defending himself from an onerous charge to perform a liturgy, Isocrates makes a claim that his value to the city was provided through his teaching.  He states that as a lifelong teacher, the value of the [[education]] that he has provided for students is worth far more than any monetary donation he can give to Athens.  His teaching has provided for civic-minded and properly educated [[Citizenship|citizen]]s that contribute to the orderly running of the city-state.  For Isocrates to be sentenced to death would be to ignore the public service that he has performed for the city, by which he has devoted his life to giving its citizens a proper rhetorical education.

== As an Autobiography ==
Isocrates was 82 years old at the time he wrote ''Antidosis'', the longest work of his life.  Antidosis is used by the author to depict himself as a model citizen and a contributor to the city-state of Athens.  Since he was nearing the end of his life, he presumably would have wanted to leave behind a legacy of a devoted and moderate citizen to his home town and to justify his life as a service to Athens and the citizens to whom he taught rhetoric.  Isocrates presents himself as a quiet citizen who avoids the public light, where [[Public speaking|oratory]] is used in a way to bring many different cases of [[Lawsuit|litigation]] against each other - which the elite believed to negatively affect the way in which the [[republic]] was run.  He tries to withdraw himself from the public interfering and intrusive efforts made into [[Democracy|democratic]] politics.

The ''Antidosis'' is not seen by some as an autobiography of Isocrates; it was written later in his life as a fictionalized story similar to his own court trial.  While there are similarities between Isocrates’s real court case and the one in the ''Antidosis'', many aspects of the case were fictionalized.  Examples are Lysimachus being the person who has brought Isocrates to trial for this crime, and the crime being different from the one with which he was actually accused.  According to George Norlin, “At any rate, in the ''Antidosis''-a title which he borrows from the actual suit to which he had just been subjected-he adopts the fiction of a capital charge brought against him by an informer named Lysimachus, and of a trial before a court with its accessories.”&lt;ref&gt;Norlin, George. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is known that in his own life Isocrates did in fact go to court in his own defense over an amount of money he was made to pay.  Isocrates argued this fine was based on the fact people thought he was wealthier than he actually was.  He claimed this distorted perception of his wealth was due to his popularity as a public figure.  This is similar to Isocrates’s defense in the ''Antidosis'' in which he claims he has been indicted due to the fact he is a very successful person, people are jealous of him, and people want to publicly embarrass him.  In the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates is charged with corrupting the youth by teaching them to become good public speakers.  With this ability, the students may trick people by convincing them of false truths which could ultimately allow the students to corrupt the government.  This is an obvious defense of his life’s work of teaching.

==As a Rhetorical Treatise==
Isocrates states that the teacher should be judged by his students, in that if they do good and moral works then the teacher has done a good job and should be [[praise]]d.  This directly opposes [[Gorgias]]’ view that it is not up to him how his students use what he teaches them.  

At the end of his Antidosis, Isocrates explains how he attempts to keep his students in high moral standing by discouraging some of the more debaucherous behaviors available in the city, such as “participating in drinking-bouts and [[Gambling|tossing dice]] in gambling dens.”  He posits the idea that as a teacher, he can be judged as successful by the moral ways in which his students live their lives when compared to other young men who are wasting their youth in revelry. Hence he agrees to submit to the punishment if any of his students can be shown to be bad influences on [[society]] and challenges his accuser to present even one student who could be said to belong to the group of degenerate youth.

Another important topic is natural talent. Isocrates argues that native ability is necessary for becoming a good orator, along with a proper education on the subject and practical experience.

==Commentary==
D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Johnson (2010) pointed out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.protrepticus.info/2011/06/antidosis-and-protrepticus.html|title=Antidosis and Protrepticus|year=2011|authors=D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Ransome Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Aristotle’s Protrepticus was written in the late 350s in polemical response to a work by the Athenian philosopher and teacher Isocrates called the Antidosis. In this work, Isocrates contested the application of the word philosophy to the kind of abstract and speculative mathematical preoccupations current in Plato’s Academy. For him, education and philosophy meant training men to become effective political leaders, and the means to this was training in rhetoric. Speculation about advanced mathematics, astronomy, and the “elements” or “principles” of nature were useful as “mental gymnastic” for the young but, according to the argument, in adulthood become distractions from the important business of military, political, and legal action. In the Protrepticus, Aristotle responded to Isocrates’ attack on Academic philosophy by defending the search for the elements and principles of nature as the best means not only for political science, but for every other goal in life as well.''

'''April Fools' Day''' (sometimes called '''All Fools' Day''') is an annual celebration in some European and [[Western world|Western]] countries commemorated on April 1 by playing [[practical joke]]s and spreading [[hoax]]es. The jokes and their victims are called '''April fools'''. People playing April Fool jokes often expose their prank by shouting "'''April fool(s)'''" at the unfortunate victim(s). Some newspapers, magazines and other published media report fake stories, which are usually explained the next day or below the news section in smaller letters. Although popular since the 19th century, the day is not a [[public holiday]] in any country.

Aside from April Fools' Day, the custom of setting aside a day for the playing of harmless pranks upon one's neighbour has historically been relatively common in the world.&lt;ref name=BonnerCurtis1908&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonner|first1=John|last2=Curtis|first2=George William|last3=Alden|first3=Henry Mills |author4=Samuel Stillman Conant |author5=John Foord |author6=Montgomery Schuyler |author7=John Kendrick Bangs |author8=Richard Harding Davis |author9=Carl Schurz |author10=George Brinton McClellan Harvey |author11=Henry Loomis Nelson |author12=Norman Hapgood|title=Harper's Weekly|year=1908|publisher=Harper's Magazine Company|page=6}} Retrieved on March 31, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:Washing of the Lions.jpg|thumb|An 1857 ticket to "Washing the Lions" at the [[Tower of London]] in London. No such event ever took place.]]

A disputed association between April 1 and foolishness is in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Geoffrey Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (1392).&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/4276140/april-fools-day-history/| title=No Kidding: We Have No Idea How April Fools' Day Started| date=March 31, 2016| work=[[Time Magazine]]| author=Ashley Ross| accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "[[Nun's Priest's Tale]]", a vain cock Chauntecleer is tricked by a fox on ''Syn March bigan thritty dayes and two''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canterbury Tales'', "[[s:The Canterbury Tales/The Nun's Priest's Tale|The Nun's Priest's Tale]]" - "[http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/chaucer/translation/ct/21npt.html Chaucer in the Twenty-First Century]", ''[[University of Maine at Machias]]'', September 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Readers apparently understood this line to mean "32 March", i.e. April 1.{{Citation needed|reason=What source suggests that non-modern-day readers interpreted it in this way?|date=April 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;Compare to [[Valentine's Day]], a holiday that originated with a similar misunderstanding of Chaucer.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not clear that Chaucer was referencing April 1. Modern scholars believe that there is a copying error in the extant manuscripts and that Chaucer actually wrote, ''Syn March was gon''.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Poster, Richard J. Utz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LaOwCaPBJk8C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Disputatio: an international transdisciplinary journal of the late  middle ages]'', Volume 2, pp. 16–17 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the passage would have originally meant 32 days after March, i.e. 2 May,&lt;ref name="Hoax"&gt;Boese, Alex (2008) "[http://hoaxes.org/af_database/permalink/origin_of_april_fools_day/ April Fools Day&amp;nbsp;– Origin]" ''[[Museum of Hoaxes]]''&lt;/ref&gt; the anniversary of the engagement of King [[Richard II of England]] to [[Anne of Bohemia]], which took place in 1381. 

In 1508, French poet [[Eloy d'Amerval]] referred to a ''[[April_Fools#April_fish|poisson d’avril]]'' (April fool, literally "Fish of April"), possibly the first reference to the celebration in France.&lt;ref name="Amerval"&gt;[[Eloy d'Amerval]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=53xTGw1T2P8C&amp;dq= Le Livre de la Deablerie]'', Librairie Droz, p. 70. (1991). "De maint homme et de mainte fame, poisson d'Apvril vien tost a moy."&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers suggest that April Fools' originated because in the Middle Ages, New Year's Day was celebrated on March 25 in most European towns,&lt;ref&gt;Groves, Marsha, ''Manners and Customs in the Middle Ages'', p. 27 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; through a holiday that in some areas of France, specifically, ended on April 1,&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30821/April-Fools-Day| title=April Fools' Day| work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Santino"&gt;{{cite book| title=All around the year: holidays and celebrations in American life| last=Santino| first=Jack| page=97| year=1972| publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]| isbn=978-0-252-06516-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those who celebrated New Year's Eve on January 1 made fun of those who celebrated on other dates by the invention of April Fools' Day.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; The use of January 1 as New Year's Day became common in France only by the mid-16th century,&lt;ref name="Hoax" /&gt; and the date was not adopted officially until 1564, thanks to the [[Edict of Roussillon]].

In 1539, Flemish poet Eduard de Dene wrote of a nobleman who sent his servants on foolish errands on April 1.&lt;ref name="Hoax" /&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], the origin of April Fools' Day is often attributed to the Dutch victory at [[Brielle]] in 1572, where the Spanish Duke Álvarez de Toledo was defeated. "Op 1 april verloor Alva zijn bril" is a Dutch proverb, which can be translated to: "On the first of April, Alva lost his glasses." In this case, the glasses ("bril" in Dutch) serve as a metaphor for Brielle. This theory, however, provides no explanation for the international celebration of April Fools' Day.

In 1686, [[John Aubrey]] referred to the celebration as "Fooles holy day", the first British reference.&lt;ref name="Hoax" /&gt; On April 1, 1698, several people were tricked into going to the [[Tower of London]] to "see the Lions washed".&lt;ref name="Hoax" /&gt;

Although no Biblical scholar or historian are known to have mentioned a relationship, some have expressed the belief that the origins of April Fool's Day may go back to the [[Genesis flood narrative]]. In a 1908 edition of the ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' cartoonist Bertha R. McDonald wrote:

{{quote|Authorities gravely back with it to the time of [[Noah]] and the [[Noah's Ark|ark]]. The London ''[[Public Advertiser]]'' of March 13, 1769, printed: "The mistake of Noah sending the dove out of the ark before the water had abated, on the first day of April, and to perpetuate the memory of this deliverance it was thought proper, whoever forgot so remarkable a circumstance, to punish them by sending them upon some sleeveless errand similar to that ineffectual message upon which the bird was sent by the patriarch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=McDonald |first=Bertha R. |title=The Oldest Custom in the World |magazine=[[Harper's Weekly]] |date=7 March 1908 |volume=52 |issue=2672 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLFCAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA6-PA26 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Longstanding customs ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, an April Fool joke is revealed by shouting "April fool!" at the recipient, who becomes the "April fool". A study in the 1950s, by folklorists [[Iona and Peter Opie]], found that in the UK, and in countries whose traditions derived from the UK, the joking ceased at midday.&lt;ref name="Opie 1967 245–246"&gt;{{cite book| last=Opie| first=Iona &amp; Peter| title=The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren| year=1960| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| pages=245–46| isbn=0-940322-69-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person playing a joke after midday is the "April fool" themselves.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-big-question-ow-did-the-april-fools-day-tradition-begin-and-what-are-the-best-tricks-1658944.html| title=The Big Question: How did the April Fool's Day tradition begin, and what are the best tricks?| date=April 1, 2009| work=[[The Independent]]| author=Archie Bland| accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, April Fools' Day was traditionally called 'Huntigowk Day',&lt;ref name="Opie 1967 245–246" /&gt; although this name has fallen into disuse.{{citation needed|reason=There's nothing about it falling into disuse in the Opie's book cited for this section|date=September 2014}} The name is a corruption of 'Hunt the Gowk', "gowk" being [[Scots (language)|Scots]] for a cuckoo or a foolish person; alternative terms in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] would be ''Là na Gocaireachd'', 'gowking day', or ''Là Ruith na Cuthaige'', 'the day of running the cuckoo'. The traditional prank is to ask someone to deliver a sealed message that supposedly requests help of some sort. In fact, the message reads "Dinna laugh, dinna smile. Hunt the gowk another mile." The recipient, upon reading it, will explain he can only help if he first contacts another person, and sends the victim to this next person with an identical message, with the same result.&lt;ref name="Opie 1967 245–246" /&gt;

In England a "fool" is known by different names around the country, including a "noodle", "gob", "gobby" or "noddy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=April Fool's Day | url=http://www.aprilfools-day.com| title=Different names in Different parts of England| date=April 1, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, it was traditional to entrust the victim with an "important letter" to be given to a named person. That person would then ask the victim to take it to someone else, and so on. The letter when finally opened contained the words "send the fool further".&lt;ref name=Haggerty&gt;{{cite web |last=Haggerty |first=Bridget |title=April Fool's Day |url= http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/ACalend/AprilFools.html |work=Irish Culture and Customs |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prima aprilis in Poland ===
In Poland, ''prima aprilis'' ("1 April" in [[Latin]]) as a day of jokes is a centuries-long tradition. It is a day in which many jokes are told; various hoaxes – sometimes very sophisticated – are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the "information" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1st can be a lie, or a joke. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of April Fools’ Day|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/359171/origin-of-april-fools-day/|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for some in Poland ''prima aprilis'' ends at noon of April 1st, and ''prima aprilis'' jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.

=== Nordic countries ===
Danes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians and Swedes celebrate April Fools' Day (''aprilsnar'' in Danish; ''aprillipäivä'' in Finnish). Most news media outlets will publish exactly one false story on April 1; for newspapers this will typically be a first-page article but not the top headline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=April Fool's Day: 8 Interesting Things And Hoaxes You Didn't Know|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/april-fool%E2%80%99s-day-8-interesting-things-and-hoaxes-you-didnt-know-432502|work=International Business Times|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== April fish ===
In Italy, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, and French-speaking areas of Switzerland and Canada, April 1 tradition is often known as "April fish" (''poissons d'avril'' in French, ''aprilvis'' in Dutch or ''pesce d'aprile'' in Italian). This includes attempting to attach a paper fish to the victim's back without being noticed. Such fish feature is prominently present on many late 19th- to early 20th-century French April Fools' Day [[postcard]]s. Many newspapers also spread a false story on April Fish Day, and a subtle reference to a fish is sometimes given as a clue to the fact that it is an April fool's joke.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== India ===
In India, there have been numerous references to April Fools' Day in both cinema and popular literature and people can enjoy references to the festivity on that day. However, April Fools' Day is not an intrinsic part of India's culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundootimes.com/festivals/india-april-fools-day.html|title=April Fools' Day in India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], an April Fool joke is revealed by shouting "''كذبة ابريل !''" (which means "Aprils fool!") at the recipient, who becomes the "April fool".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Spanish-speaking countries===
In many Spanish-speaking countries (and the Philippines), "Dia de los Santos Inocentes" ([[Massacre_of_the_Innocents#Feast_day|Holy Innocents Day]]) is a festivity which is very similar to the April Fools' Day, but it is celebrated in late December (27, 28 or 29 depending on the location, or January 10th for East Syrians).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Pranks ==
[[File:Make Way For Ducklings Prank.jpg|thumb|left|An April Fools' Day prank in [[Public Garden (Boston)|Boston's Public Garden]] warning people not to photograph sculptures.]]
{{Main article|List of April Fools' Day jokes}}
As well as people playing pranks on one another on April Fools' Day, elaborate practical jokes have appeared on radio and TV stations, newspapers, websites, and have been performed by large corporations. In one famous prank from 1957, the [[BBC]] broadcast a film in their ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' current affairs series purporting to show Swiss farmers picking freshly-grown spaghetti, in what they called the [[Spaghetti-tree hoax|Swiss Spaghetti Harvest]]. The BBC were later flooded with requests to purchase a spaghetti plant, forcing them to declare the film a hoax on the news the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swiss Spaghetti Harvest|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/the_swiss_spaghetti_harvest|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the advent of the Internet and readily available global news services, April Fools' pranks can catch and embarrass a wider audience than ever before.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;{{cite news|last=Moran|first=Rob|title=NPR's Brilliant April Fools’ Day Prank Was Sadly Lost On Much Of The Internet|url=http://junkee.com/nprs-brilliant-april-fools-day-prank-was-sadly-lost-on-much-of-the-internet/32077|accessdate=April 6, 2014|date=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparable prank days ==
December 28, the equivalent day in Spain, [[Hispanic America]] and the Philippines, is also the Christian day of celebration of the "[[Día de los Inocentes|Day of the Holy Innocents]]". The Christian celebration is a holiday in its own right, a religious one, but the tradition of pranks is not, though the latter is observed yearly. After somebody plays a joke or a prank on somebody else, the joker usually cries out, in some regions of Hispanic America: ''Inocente palomita que te dejaste engañar'' ("You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled"), not to be confused with the second translation of palomita, which is popcorn.

In Mexico, the phrase is ''¡Inocente para siempre!'' which means "Innocent forever!". In Argentina, the prankster says ''¡Que la inocencia te valga!'', which roughly translates as a piece of advice on not to be as gullible as the victim of the prank. In Spain, it is common to say just ''¡Inocente!'' (which in Spanish can mean "Innocent!", but also "Gullible!").&lt;ref name=Vilaweb&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/670807/20030401/noticia.html| title=Avui és el Dia d'Enganyar a Menorca|trans-title=Today is Fooling Day on Minorca| publisher=[[Vilaweb]]| date=April 1, 2003| language=Catalan| accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Colombia, the term used is "Pásala por Inocentes", which roughly means: "Let it go; today it's Innocent's Day."

In Belgium, this day is also known as the "Day of the innocent children" or "Day of the stupid children". It used to be a day where parents, grandparents, and teachers would fool the children in some way. But the celebration of this day has died out in favor of April Fools' Day.

Nevertheless, on the Spanish island of [[Menorca]], ''Dia d'enganyar'' ("Fooling day") is celebrated on April 1 because Menorca was a British possession during part of the 18th century. In Brazil, the "Dia da mentira" ("Day of the lie") is also celebrated on April 1.&lt;ref name=Vilaweb /&gt;

In Iran, on 13th of the first month ([[Farvardin]]) of the Iranian calendar (known as Nature's day or [[Sizdah Be-dar]], 1st or 2nd of April), it is common that people spread false news and then shout "Doroughe sizdah" (lie of 13) to the victim. Some of the newspapers and journals also do the same and then somewhere in the bottom of page write "Doroughe sizdah" with inverse letters.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Reception ==
The practice of April Fool pranks and hoaxes is controversial.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Doll |first=Jen |url=https://news.yahoo.com/april-fools-day-worst-holiday-175852795.html |title=Is April Fools' Day the Worst Holiday?&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo News |publisher=Yahoo! News |date=April 1, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixed opinions of critics are epitomized in the reception to the 1957 BBC "[[Spaghetti-tree hoax]]", in reference to which, newspapers were split over whether it was "a great joke or a terrible hoax on the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26723188 |title=Is this the best April Fool's ever? |publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positive view is that April Fools' can be good for one's health because it encourages "jokes, hoaxes...pranks, [and] belly laughs", and brings all the benefits of laughter including stress relief and reducing strain on the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.health.com/2013/04/01/why-april-fools-day-is-good-for-your-health/ |title=Why April Fools’ Day is Good For Your Health&amp;nbsp;– Health News and Views |publisher=News.Health.com |date=April 1, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many "best of" April Fools' Day lists that are compiled in order to showcase the best examples of how the day is celebrated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/04/01/april-fools-best-online-pranks |title=April Fools: the best online pranks &amp;#124; SBS News |publisher=Sbs.com.au |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various April Fools' campaigns have been praised for their innovation, creativity, writing, and general effort.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The negative view describes April Fools' hoaxes as "creepy and manipulative", "rude" and "a little bit nasty", as well as based on ''[[schadenfreude]]'' and deceit.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt; When genuine news or a genuine important order or warning is issued on April Fools' Day, there is risk that it will be misinterpreted as a joke and ignored – for example, when [[Google]], known to play elaborate April Fools' Day hoaxes, announced the launch of [[Gmail]] with 1-[[gigabyte]] inboxes in 2004, an era when competing [[webmail]] services offered 4-[[megabyte|megabytes]] or less, many dismissed it as a joke outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techland.time.com/2013/04/01/google-april-fools/ |title=Google's Greatest April Fools’ Hoax Ever (Hint: It Wasn’t a Hoax) |author=Harry McCracken |work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]].com |date=April 1, 2013 |accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-04-01-gmail-no-joke_x.htm |title=Google: 'Gmail' no joke, but lunar jobs are |author=Lisa Baertlein |publisher=Reuters |date=April 1, 2004 |accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, sometimes stories intended as jokes are taken seriously. Either way, there can be adverse effects, such as confusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woods |first=Michael |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/445856/brazeau-tweets-his-resignation-on-april-fools-day-causing-confusion/ |title=Brazeau tweets his resignation on April Fool's Day, causing confusion&amp;nbsp;– National |publisher=Globalnews.ca |date=April 2, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; misinformation, waste of resources (especially when the hoax concerns people in danger) and even legal or commercial consequences.&lt;ref name=Hasham&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasham|first=Nicole|title=ASIC to look into prank Metgasco email from schoolgirl Kudra Falla-Ricketts|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/asic-to-look-into-prank-metgasco-email-from-schoolgirl-kudra-fallaricketts-20140402-35yy7.html|accessdate=April 3, 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bieber&gt;{{cite news|title=Justin Bieber's Believe album hijacked by DJ Paz|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/justin-biebers-believe-album-hijacked-by-dj-paz-20140403-35zy2.html|accessdate=April 3, 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People obeying hoax messages to telephone "Mr.C.Lion" and "Mr.L.E.Fant" and suchlike at a telephone number that turns out to be a zoo, sometimes cause a serious overload to zoos' telephone switchboards.

Other examples of genuine news on April 1 mistaken as a hoax include:
* 1 April 1946: Warnings about the [[Aleutian Island earthquake]]'s [[tsunami]] that killed 165 people in [[Hawaii]] and [[Alaska]]
* 1 April 2005: News that the comedian [[Mitch Hedberg]] had died on 29 March 2005
* 1 April 2005: Announcement about ''[[Powerpuff Girls Z]]'', by [[Aniplex]], [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Toei Animation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ppgcom.gooside.com/ppgz/index2.html| title= Powerpuff Girls Z Debut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Books, films, telemovies and television episodes have used April Fool's Day as their title or inspiration. Examples include [[Bryce Courtenay|Bryce Courtenay's]] novel ''[[April Fool's Day (novel)|April Fool's Day]]'' (1993), whose title refers to the day Courtenay's son died. The 1990s [[sitcom]] ''[[Roseanne]]'' featured an episode titled "April Fools' Day". This turned out to be intentionally misleading, as the episode was about Tax Day in the United States on April 15&amp;nbsp;– the last day to submit the previous year's tax information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7257">The first moves of a [[backgammon]] game are the '''opening moves''', collectively referred to as the opening, and studied in the '''backgammon opening theory'''. Backgammon opening theory is not developed in as much detail as [[Chess theory#Opening theory|opening theory in chess]], which has been widely studied. The reason for this is that following the first move in backgammon, there are 21 dice roll outcomes on each subsequent move, and many alternative plays for each outcome, making the [[Game tree|tree of possible positions]] in backgammon expand much more rapidly than in chess.

Despite the complications posed by this rapid branching of possibilities, over the course of many years, a consensus did develop among backgammon experts on what is the preferred opening move for each given roll. Following the emergence of [[Reinforcement learning|self-trained]] backgammon-playing [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]], the insights on what are the best opening moves have changed in some unexpected ways.

==Preferred opening moves==
The table below summarizes the most commonly preferred moves, for each of the 15 possible opening rolls, as selected by detailed computer simulations, referred to as "[[rollout (backgammon)|rollouts]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+179 Kit Woolsey on Backgammon Galore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+649 Chuck Bower on backgammon Galore]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are no opening moves consisting of doubles, because at the start of the game, each player rolls one die. Whoever rolls higher moves first, using the numbers on the already-rolled dice. In the case of a tie, the players roll again.
In cases where no preferred play but only two or more alternative plays are given, these appear to be of equivalent strength within the statistical uncertainties of the simulations and no play could be singled out that is clearly superior.

The moves are captured in standard [[backgammon notation]]. For instance, 8/5 denotes the move of a piece from the 8-point to the 5-point.

{{anchor|Lover's leap}}
The general message that emerges from the above table can be summarised as follows: unless one can make a point, and with the exception of the running move 24/13 (in which, having thrown a 6-5, the player moves a piece from the 24-point to the 13-point; the ''lover's leap''), a successful play is often the combination of splitting the 24-point and moving a checker from the 13-point. The latter move should be as small as possible (resulting in a builder close to the 13-point), unless the stack at the 8-point can be reached (resulting in an equal distribution between the 13-point and the 8-point).  However, there are plenty of exceptions to this rule; for example, a 4-3 or 3-2 is often best played by moving two checkers from the 13 point.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;[http://www.bkgm.com/openings.html Survey of opening rolls by Tom Keith on Backgammon Galore]&lt;/ref&gt;

The above opening moves which emerged from computer analysis demonstrate that a number of opening moves that were unquestioned for many decades are now considered suboptimal. One example is the move 13/11-13/8 on the roll 5-2. Although not a bad move, the alternative choice preferred by the analyses, 24/22-13/8, is now generally agreed upon to be optimal. In other cases, computer analysis has resulted in alternative strategies that were not seriously considered in the past. For instance, the opening move 8/2-6/2 for a roll of 6-4 was in the past greeted with disdain from experts (making the 2-point instead of trying for a higher home point), but turns out to be on average as effective as the usual plays (24/14 and 24/18-13/9).


==Influencing factors==
The  opening moves above apply to money play, meaning that these plays optimise the expected payout with gammons counting double, etc. In match play the match score affects the checker play and one of the alternative plays may come out on top in computer simulations depending on the score.&lt;ref&gt; BGOnline.org Opening Moves AtS  http://bgonline.org/1ats/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+682 Kit Woolsey: Factors to consider in opening moves]&lt;/ref&gt; In a "Gammon-go" situation the player does not care about whether they lose a single game or a gammon, but they have much to gain from winning a gammon; thus they can benefit from aggressive openings.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;  The opposite may be true in "gammon-save" situations, where the player has little to lose from losing a single game, but much to lose from losing a gammon. At double-match-point (DMP) where the score is tied with each player needing one point to win, gammons do not matter for either player.

In practice, an even more important influencing factor is the preferred style of the player. A player might have a strong preference for one out of a number of alternative opening plays that are on average as effective, because the character of the move (passive or aggressive) better suits his or her playing style.&lt;ref&gt;Backgammon opening moves on Winning Backgammon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls/ Opening rolls on Backgammon.org (1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824094629/http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls/ |date=2006-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls-2/ |title=Opening rolls on Backgammon.org (2) |access-date=2006-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824100205/http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls-2/ |archive-date=2006-08-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls-3/ |title=Opening rolls on Backgammon.org (3) |access-date=2006-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824100217/http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls-3/ |archive-date=2006-08-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls-4/ |title=Opening rolls on Backgammon.org (4) |access-date=2006-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824100229/http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-opening-rolls-4/ |archive-date=2006-08-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">The '''Bangalore circus fire''' occurred on 8 February 1981 at the Venus Circus in [[Bangalore]], [[India]], where more than 92 lives were lost, the majority of them being children.
The circus fire had some similarities to the [[Hartford circus fire]], which occurred on the afternoon of 6 July 1944.

==Incident==
The fire swept the main tent of the [[circus]], which crashed down in flames onto a crowd of about 4,000 people, setting off a stampede towards the exits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/09/world/death-toll-raised-to-66-in-fire-at-circus-in-india.html| title=Death Toll Raised to 66 In Fire at Circus in India| date=February 9, 1981| publisher=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire disaster claimed 92 lives and 300 others were injured.&lt;ref name="pmid"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 6640383| doi= 10.1016/0305-4179(83)90123-7|title= 1981 Circus fire disaster in Bangalore, India: Causes, management of burn patients and possible presentation|year= 1983|last1= Das|first1= R.A.P.|journal= Burns|volume= 10|pages= 17–29|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 56 of those killed, and many of those hurt, were school children.

Several of the burn victims were charred beyond recognition. A total of 119 patients were treated in the Burns centre at [[Victoria Hospital (Bangalore Medical College)|Victoria Hospital]]. Fourteen patients with more than 80 percent burns died within 48 hours of the disaster. 32 patients were operated by skin grafting or flap procedures.&lt;ref name="pmid"/&gt;

==Cause==
The cause of the fire was speculated to be a discarded cigarette&lt;ref name="Lakeland"/&gt; or an electric short circuit.&lt;ref name="Record"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DwVIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UAANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1534,1048534&amp;hl=en| title=66 perish as Big Top goes afire| date=Feb 9, 1981| publisher=Record-Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blaze erupted at the back gate as a three-hour matinee &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/08/world/around-the-world-58-in-india-are-killed-by-fire-in-a-circus-tent.html| title=58 in India Are Killed, By Fire in a Circus Tent| date=February 8, 1981| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
had ended and the spectators were moving towards the exits. Apart from the spectators inside, another huge crowd was waiting outside the tent for the next show.&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt;
The flames quickly spread through the canvas top and wooden bleachers,&lt;ref name="Lakeland"/&gt; whipped by strong winds. It took only 15 minutes for the fire to consume the tent, long before the first fire engines arrived.&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt; The 4000-seater spectator gallery was also destroyed during the fire. Help could not be sought immediately as the telephone lines were dead. Many of the female performers ran into the fire to save the children.
No animals were hurt as they were not inside the ring at the time, and employees pulled caged tigers and lions away from the blaze. Elephants and horses broke their tethers and escaped to safety.&lt;ref name="Record"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3654">'''Bangladeshi animation''' is still a new form of visual arts but experiencing a rapid growth. The animation industry employs about 12,000 people of different ages in [[Bangladesh]]. Most of the animation works are of outsourced projects from western developed nations. Other animation works include projects related to social awareness related programs and for TV advertisement purposes. Few animation studios are also producing animated short and feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/asia/2014/02/bangladesh-animation-industry-growing-20142184718988970.html | title=Bangladesh animation industry growing | publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] | date=18 February 2014 | people=[[Rob Reynolds (journalist)|Rob Reynolds]] | location=Dhaka, Bangladesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some animation festivals that annually take place in Bangladesh, most prominently the [[International Animation and Cartoon Festival]].

== History ==
Bangladeshi animation traces its origin in the 1980s when the National Institute of Mass Communications started to offer courses on animation. The first major animation project in Bangladesh was a cartoon series titled ''[[Meena (TV series)|Meena]]'', developed as part of some social awareness programs in partnership with [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meena is for all|url=http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/media_2140.htm|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meena was first released in 1993 and became a household name across Bangladeshi children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meena and UNICEF|url=http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/kidsspace_5104.htm|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, another animated television series was released titled ''[[The Adventures of Montu Miah]]'' which became hugely popular within a short time. In 2013, the first edition of ''International Animation Cartoon Festival Bangladesh'', the only major animated film festival in Bangladesh, took place at the [[Shishu Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3-day animation fest features local, foreign cartoons |url=http://www.newagebd.com/detail.php?date=2013-03-31&amp;nid=44547 |accessdate=26 April 2014 |newspaper=New Age |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426234944/http://www.newagebd.com/detail.php?date=2013-03-31&amp;nid=44547 |archivedate=26 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production of the first Bangladeshi animated feature film, titled ''[[The Dreamstage]]'', began in 2013 which is set to release in mid-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘The Dreamstage’ to be BD’s first animated feature film|url=http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?%20%20%20nssl=8e96206c19fa335a98b84093a2af34e1&amp;nttl=0109201376492|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=Banglanews24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Black Knight Sword'''''|ブラック・ナイト・ソード|Burakku Naito Sōdo}} is a [[side-scrolling]] action platformer game co-developed by [[Grasshopper Manufacture]] and [[Digital Reality]]. It was released in North America on the [[PlayStation 3]] via the [[PlayStation Network]] on December 11, 2012 and on [[Xbox 360]] via [[Xbox Live Arcade]] on December 12, 2012.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Black Knight Sword screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Black Knight Sword'' features a unique [[Kamishibai]] art style.]]

''Black Knight Sword'' plays is a side-scrolling action game. Players control a character who takes on the identity of the Black Knight and his sword on their quest to defeat the White Princess. The game features a theater styled backdrop whereupon the character remains static as the backdrops change place to give the player a feeling of movement. &lt;ref name="engadget announce"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2011/08/17/grasshopper-and-digital-reality-reveal-black-knight-sword-for/ | title = Grasshopper and Digital Reality reveal 'Black Knight Sword' for PSN and XBLA | first = JC | last = Fletcher | date = August 17, 2011 | website = [[Engadget]] ([[Joystiq]]) | publisher = [[Oath Inc.]] | accessdate = June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player is armed with a magical sword used to dispatch foes, and the game also features elements of platforming. Hearts can be collected from fallen enemies, which in turn can be used in various in-game shops to purchase equipment and upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.xboxachievements.com/news/news-11386-Black-Knight-Sword-Hands-On-Preview-%E2%80%93--Tis-But-a-Scratch-.html | title = Black Knight Sword Hands-On Preview – 'Tis But a Scratch! | first = Richard | last = Walker | date = April 6, 2012 | website = Xbox Achievements | accessdate = June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game begins with a [[narrator]] stating "The wormwood sways back and forth, embracing the wind", as [[stage curtain]]s open to reveal the set of a [[Play (theatre)|play]], and the [[player character]], Grahame Wormwood, having committed [[suicide]] by hanging himself in an empty bedroom. He sways back and forth to free himself from the [[noose]] around his neck, and what lies in front of him on the floor is a black suit of armor impaled with a sword, and a small, doll-like female character, known as Black Hellebore hovering above it. Black Hellebore then seems to inhabit the sword by phasing inside of it, and Grahame pulls the sword from the suit of armor. The black suit of armor then binds itself to Wormwood, as the play continues with Wormwood (now as the Black Knight), with the help of Black Hellebore, progressing through [[stage set]]s filled with hostile creatures, whom are often disembodied heads, other grotesque monstrosities, and [[wild animals]].

The [[stage play]] is separated into and presented in 5 acts, with each act prefacing itself with [[fairy tale]]-like scenarios involving animals and their deaths. The animals in these stories serve as each act's finale. For example, one tale tells of a spider that saved a princess from entrapment, only to have been killed by her unassuming father upon her return. This spider then serves as the act's finale, with the Black Knight engaging it in battle. The narrator often tells the audience to "beware" before these encounters occur, and applauds the Black Knight when he defeats these creatures. This theme of Wormwood having to make his way past animals with seemingly unfortunate pasts continues until the play reaches its final act, which is prefaced with a story about two constantly bickering sisters. The story states that God disapproved of their arguing so much that He trapped the two inside of their own fairy tale, where they could bicker for the rest of eternity.

As the Black Knight makes his way to act 5's finale, the narrator (seemingly addressing the Black Knight himself) starts to question if he even remembers all the ones he's killed and loved. As color progressively fades from the set, the narrator continues to state that if they are forgotten, then there is "nothing left."

The Black Knight then finds himself standing in front of the hanged Grahame Wormwood, whom he cuts from his noose with his sword. The room then fills with white flowers as a White Princess appears. The Black Knight taunts the Princess and engages her in battle. The White Princess appears ethereal as she floats around, [[telepathically]] chucking disembodied heads at the Black Knight and growing to an inhuman size. She then begins throwing eggs at the Black Knight which hatch into the disembodied heads and grotesque creatures he's already been facing throughout the play, where it's revealed that the White Princess was in control of these creatures all along. After The Black Knight defeats the White Princess (with invaluable help from Black Hellebore), her body dissipates and leaves a white suit of armor and white sword behind, as a small, white, doll-like character emerges; White Hellebore. Black Hellebore and White Hellebore are the two sisters mentioned in the prefacing tale, and true to the story, they start fighting each other as the Black Knight watches on. White Hellebore then animates the white suit of armor, and the White Knight appears and begins to attack the Black Knight.

The game concludes with a battle between the Black Knight and the White Knight on a stage set that's looking down at the Earth. After the White Knight and White Hellebore are defeated, the Black Knight and Black Hellebore then return to the initial bedroom set of the play, passing all of the previous sets along the way. Before entering the room, Black Hellebore removes herself from the sword the Black Knight is holding and flies away, as the sword and the armor dissipate completely, with Wormwood freed from the armor's binding. Wormwood then enters the bedroom and once again hangs himself. The narrator then reiterates the line "The Wormwood sways back and forth, embracing the wind," and adds "one day, the fields themselves will wither and fade. The wormwood forgotten by all," as the stage curtains close and the play comes to an end.

''Black Knight Sword'' received "mixed or average reviews" on both platforms according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mcps3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcx360" /&gt;

Critics praised the game's art style, with ''[[Eurogamer]]'' stating, "Its richest ideas are to be found in the presentation, the aesthetic, the art direction and stage direction."&lt;ref name="eurog" /&gt; Reviewers often criticized its gameplay, however. While Meristation praised the gameplay, stating, "''Black Knight Sword'' is a good return to the roots of the 16-bit action games, well crafted, with an amazing design",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://meristation.as.com/xbox-360/black-knight-sword/analisis-juego/1535833 | title = Black Knight Sword (360) | language = Spanish | first = Pablo González | last = Taboada | date = December 13, 2012 | website = Meristation | accessdate = June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; other reviewers cited the game's difficulty as a point of contention. ''[[Joystiq]]'' wrote, "Yes, [the PSN version's] Normal mode itself is tremendously hard, but not in such a way as to make the struggle seem worth it, or even remotely do-able."&lt;ref name="engadget review" /&gt;

[[Daye Jack]] is the only featured artist on the album.

==Background and recording==
Tove Lo's previous album, ''[[Lady Wood]]'', was released on 28 October 2016 to positive critical reviews and fair commercial success, with it eventually becoming her highest-charting album in the United States to date. In press interviews in support of the album's release, Tove Lo alluded to another album of thematically similar material slated for release the following year that was tentatively titled ''Lady Wood: Phase II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2016/10/28/tove-lo-lady-wood-album/92709012/|title=Swedish singer Tove Lo: 'Don't tell me what I can't say'|work=[[USA Today]]|last=Ryan|first=Patrick|date=28 October 2016|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2017, Tove Lo began the [[Lady Wood Tour]] in further support of the album, and during press interviews she said she was working on new material to be included with the portion that was already recorded during the ''Lady Wood'' sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fuse.tv/2017/06/tove-lo-interview-governors-ball-2017-lady-wood-album-sequel-vaginas|title=Governors Ball 2017: Tove Lo Talks 'Lady Wood' Album Sequel &amp; Being Proud of Your Vagina|work=[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]|last=Gracie|first=Bianca|date=5 June 2017|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Blue Lips'' track "Bitches", originally titled "What I Want for the Night (Bitches)", was previewed through Tove Lo's short film ''[[Fairy Dust (film)|Fairy Dust]]'' in October 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/10/31/tove-lo-lady-wood-short-film/|title=Tove Lo's Lady Wood short film previews new music|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Feeney|first=Nolan|date=31 October 2016|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a live version was released through [[Spotify]] in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotify Singles by Tove Lo on Spotify|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/6FOhbAW6X74onlLJOTNIjD|website=Spotify|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tove Lo also previewed the track "Struggle" (then titled "The Struggle") during her performance at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1935431/watch-tove-lo-debut-new-song-the-struggle-at-coachella/video/|title=Watch Tove Lo Debut New Song "The Struggle" At Coachella|work=[[Stereogum]]|last=Rettig|first=James|date=17 April 2017|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the months leading up to the album's release, Tove Lo said that thematically ''Blue Lips'' would be a "dramatic" and "highly emotional" sister to ''Lady Wood'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papermag.com/swedish-pop-star-tove-lo-on-rocking-coachella-her-dream-collabs-and-fl-2376537617.html|title=Swedish Pop Star Tove Lo on Rocking Coachella, Her Dream Collabs, and Flashing Her Fans|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|last=Ward|first=Kat|date=24 April 2017|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it would have two contrasting chapters: "Light Beams" and "Pitch Black".&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; The album's official title was announced in conjunction with its lead single "[[Disco Tits]]" on 7 September 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1961329/tove-lo-disco-tits/music/|title=Tove Lo – "Disco Tits"|work=[[Stereogum]]|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=7 September 2017|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's artwork was released on Tove Lo's social media on 31 October 2017.

The U.S. Indian Census Rolls, 1885–1940, list Barker as an official member of the [[Sioux]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Robert (Bob) Barker - South Dakota's Indian Census Roll April 1, 1930 | url = http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Robert_(Bob)_Barker_-_South_Dakota%27s_Indian_Census_Roll;_April_1,_1930.jpg | accessdate =June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = U.S., Indian Census Rolls, 1885-1940 Record for Robert Barker | publisher = ancestry.com | url = http://search.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=View&amp;r=an&amp;dbid=1059&amp;iid=M595_440-0017&amp;fn=Robert&amp;ln=Barker&amp;st=r&amp;ssrc=&amp;pid=2281849 | accessdate =June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = U.S. Indian Census Rolls, 1885-1940 about Robert Barker | publisher = ancestry.com | url = http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=1&amp;new=1&amp;MSAV=0&amp;msT=1&amp;gss=angs-g&amp;gsfn=Robert&amp;gsln=Barker&amp;mswpn__ftp=South+Dakota%2c+USA&amp;mswpn=44&amp;mswpn_PInfo=5-44&amp;msbdy=1923&amp;uidh=qg3&amp;pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&amp;h=2281849&amp;db=Indian_Schedules&amp;indiv=1 | accessdate =June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Matilda ("Tillie") Valandra ({{née}} Matilda Kent Tarleton), was a school teacher; his father, Byron John Barker, was the foreman on the electrical high line through the state of Washington. Barker is 1/8 [[Sioux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Axelrod | first = Laura | title = Book Review: Priceless Memories by Bob Barker with Digby Diehl | publisher = lauraaxelrod.net | url = http://www.lauraaxelrod.net/2009/03/book-review-priceless-memories-by-bob-barker-with-digby-diehl.html | accessdate = October 23, 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018105421/http://www.lauraaxelrod.net/2009/03/book-review-priceless-memories-by-bob-barker-with-digby-diehl.html | archivedate = October 18, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Washington, his father fell from a tower and sustained an injury which resulted in his death in 1929. Barker has a half-brother, Kent Valandra, from Matilda's subsequent remarriage. In 1931, the family moved to [[Springfield, Missouri]], where Barker graduated from [[Central High School (Springfield, Missouri)|Central High School]] in 1941.

Barker attended Drury College (now [[Drury University]]) in Springfield, on a basketball [[athletic scholarship|scholarship]].&lt;ref name="biography1"/&gt; He was a member of the Epsilon Beta Chapter of [[Sigma Nu]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] at Drury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmanu.org/about/famous_sigmanus.php |title=Famous Sigma Nus |publisher=Sigma Nu Fraternity, Inc. |accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the outbreak of [[World War II]], Barker served in the [[United States Navy]] as a [[fighter pilot]]. However, the war ended before he was assigned to a [[Squadron (aviation)|seagoing squadron]]. After the war, he returned to Drury to finish his education, graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' with a degree in [[economics]].&lt;ref name="biography1"/&gt;

==Career==

===Broadcasting career===
While attending college in Drury, Barker worked his first "media job", at [[KTTS-FM]] Radio, in Springfield. He and his wife left Springfield and moved to [[Lake Worth, Florida]], and he was news editor and announcer at nearby WWPG 1340 AM in Palm Beach (now WPBR in Lantana).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scrippsmedia.com/ktts/news/206929541.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711193249/http://www.scrippsmedia.com/ktts/news/206929541.html |archivedate=July 11, 2015 |title=Bob Barker Shares Story Of Fire While Working At KTTS |publisher=scrippsmedia.com |date=May 10, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Barker moved to California in order to pursue a career in broadcasting. He was given his own radio show, ''The Bob Barker Show'', which ran for the next six years from Burbank.&lt;ref name="biography1"/&gt; He was hosting an audience-participation radio show on [[KNX (AM)]] in [[Los Angeles]] when game show producer [[Ralph Edwards]] happened to be listening and liked Barker's voice and style.&lt;ref name=autobio/&gt;

===Game show career===
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2009}}

====''Truth or Consequences'' (1956–1974)====
[[File:Bob Barker 1958 Truth or Consequences.jpg|thumb|Bob Barker in ''Truth or Consequences'', circa 1958]]
Barker started hosting ''[[Truth or Consequences]]'' on December 31, 1956, and continued with the program until 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Total Television | first= Alex | last= McNeil | page = 867 | publisher = (4th edition) [[Penguin Books]] | year = 1996 | isbn=978-0140249163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was to mix the original quiz element of game shows with wacky stunts. On the show, people had to answer a trivia question correctly (usually an off-the-wall question that no one would be able to answer correctly) before "Beulah the Buzzer" was sounded. If the contestant did not complete the "Truth" portion, there was a "Consequences", usually a zany and embarrassing stunt. If the contestant answered the question, invariably, the question had a second part. In addition, during Barker's run as host, "Barker's Box" was played. Barker's Box was a box with four drawers in it. If a contestant was able to pick all three drawers with money inside before picking the empty drawer, they won a bonus prize.

It was on ''Truth or Consequences'' that the salute became his trademark sign-off; he ended each episode with "Bob Barker saying goodbye, and hoping all your consequences are happy ones!"{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

====''End of the Rainbow'' (1957–1958)====
On December 4, 1957, Barker began hosting a new Ralph Edwards creation, the short-lived ''End of the Rainbow'' for NBC. On this show (similar to Barker's ''Truth or Consequences'' and Edwards' ''[[This Is Your Life]]''), he and co-host Art Baker went out to various places in America and surprised the less-fortunate who helped others when they could barely help themselves.

For example, the first episode featured a [[Minneapolis]] grocer who, in return for his community service, was given a complete makeover to his store plus new furniture and appliances for his home. In addition, his landlord (who was in on the surprise) announced that the current month's rent was free and that the grocer's rent would never increase.

====''The Family Game'' (1967)====
In 1967, Barker hosted the short-lived game show ''[[Family Game|The Family Game]]'' for [[Chuck Barris]], where he asked children contestants questions about their families' lives, and the parents had to guess how they answered, similar to ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''.

====''Simon Says'' (1971)====
In 1971, Barker was tapped to host a pilot for NBC entitled ''Simon Says'', which required him to interact with a giant computer called "Simon" in ''[[Let's Make A Deal]]''-style "trades". The pilot was produced by Wesley J. Cox of DUNDAS Productions, and its theme was "The Savers" (the theme used on ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'', which has led some to believe that Cox or DUNDAS was an alias for Jack Barry or Dan Enright, since ''Joker'' used the theme in its original 1968 pilot). There is at least one (somewhat low-quality) clip of the pilot on the video sharing website [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Mneno-WH_6g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''That's My Line'' (1980–1981)====
In 1980, Barker hosted a series called ''[[That's My Line]]'' for Goodson-Todman. The series was not a game show, but rather a program along the lines of ''[[Real People]]'' and ''[[That's Incredible!]]'' The show's second season in 1981 focused more on unusual stunts, and was cancelled in September.

====''The Price Is Right'' (1972–2007)====
[[File:Bob Barker 1975.jpg|thumb|190px|Bob Barker in 1975]]
In early 1972, [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] began shopping a modernized revival of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' to stations, with [[Dennis James]] as host. CBS expressed interest in the series, on one condition: instead of James, Barker would be installed as host. After some initial resistance, Barker instead offered to host another upcoming CBS game show, Jack Barry's ''[[The Joker's Wild]]'' (which had difficulty finding a host and was scheduled to debut the same day as ''Price'') to allow James to host ''Price'', but CBS rejected this proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Lynette|title=Bob Barker on saying goodbye to ''The Price Is Right''|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2007/06/08/bob-barker-saying-goodbye-price-right|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual compromise that was struck led to Barker hosting the daytime ''Price'' on CBS, James hosting the weekly nighttime ''Price'' in syndication, and Jack Barry himself (first on a trial basis, then eventually permanently) hosting ''Joker''.

On September 4, 1972, Barker began hosting the CBS revival of ''The Price Is Right''.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, p. 671&lt;/ref&gt; In the 35 years of the CBS version, Barker became far more associated with the series than first host [[Bill Cullen]] was with the [[The Price Is Right (1956 US version)|1956–65 original]]. When James' contract for the nighttime ''Price'' expired without being renewed in 1977, Barker assumed hosting duties for three nighttime seasons as well, with the nighttime series eventually ending in 1980.

On October 15, 1987, Barker did what other MCs almost never did: renounced hair dye and began wearing his hair gray, which was its natural color by that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-08/news/tv-514_1_bob-barker | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Susan | last=King | title=Bob Barker Wins the Game of Endurance | date=July 8, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow hosts [[Monty Hall]], [[Alex Trebek]], and [[Richard Dawson]] did the same in the late 1980s.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Barker took over the role of [[executive producer]] for the show in 1988, following the death of the original executive producer, [[Frank Wayne]]. In this capacity, Barker created several pricing games, instituted a prohibition on foreign cars and animal-based products (see "Animal rights" below), and launched a prime-time series of specials known as ''[[The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular]]''.

In September 2006, ''The Price Is Right'' marked its 35th consecutive year on the air. It is the longest-running game show of all time in North America, and at the time was the last surviving show in the daytime game show genre, having survived (at the time) twelve years after its last competitor had been canceled. (CBS later revived daytime game shows in 2009.) Overall, in daytime programming (excluding Saturday and Sunday), ''The Price Is Right'' is ranked sixth among the longest-continuing daytime television programs (NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' ranks the longest, followed by four daytime soap operas: ''[[Guiding Light]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[General Hospital]]'', and ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''). It has won its time slot (11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]) for the past 25&amp;nbsp;years with its closest competitor (currently [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'') normally getting about half of ''TPIR's'' ratings.

{{Wikinews|Bob Barker to retire as host of U.S. gameshow The Price Is Right}}
On October 31, 2006, Barker made his announcement that he would retire from ''The Price Is Right'' in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keveney |first=Bill |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-10-31-bob-barker_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA |title=Bob Barker, 82, to retire |work=USA Today |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taped his final episode on June 6, 2007, with the show airing twice on June 15.&lt;ref name="variety-final"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965636.html?categoryId=14&amp;cs=1|title=Barker's final 'Price' airing June 15|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Josef |last= Adalian|date=May 22, 2007|accessdate=May 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014073735/http://variety.com/article/VR1117965636.html?categoryId=14&amp;cs=1|archivedate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first airing was in the show's normal daytime slot and the second airing was in primetime as the lead-in to the ''Daytime Emmy Awards''. Repeat episodes from Barker's final season continued to air until October 12, 2007. On July 23 it was announced that comedian [[Drew Carey]] would take Barker's place as the new host for the show beginning on October 15, 2007.

During Barker's tenure as host, three pricing games were introduced that used his name: Barker's Bargain Bar, Barker's Marker$ and Trader Bob. Of the three, the latter two are not actively played on the show – Trader Bob was retired from the show in 1985, Barker's Marker$ was renamed Make Your Mark following Barker's retirement, and subsequently retired, and Barker's Bargain Bar has been retooled as the Bargain Game after a four-year hiatus between 2008 and 2012.

After his retirement, Barker made three return appearances to ''The Price is Right''.  He first appeared on the episode that aired on April 16, 2009 to promote his new autobiography, ''Priceless Memories''. He appeared in the Showcase round at the end of the show.&lt;ref name="Steward Levine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118001621.html?categoryId=14&amp;cs=1 |title=Barker to appear on 'Price Is Right' |author=Steward Levine |accessdate=March 30, 2009 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker made another guest appearance on the show to celebrate his 90th birthday celebration, which aired on December 12, 2013. He announced a contestant for the first time ever on the show, along with one showcase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-barker-returns-to-the-price-is-right-for-birthday-celebration/|title=Bob Barker returns to "The Price is Right" for birthday celebration |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |work=[[CBS News]] |date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker also made a surprise appearance on April 1, 2015 for an April Fools' Day switch where he took Drew's place at the show's intro. He hosted the first one bid and pricing game of that day before handing the hosting duties back to Drew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slane |first=Kevin |date=April 1, 2015 |title=Bob Barker Appeared on ''The Price is Right'' and Everyone Lost Their Minds |url=http://www.bdcwire.com/bob-barker-april-fools/?p1=recent_headline_4_hp |newspaper=Boston Globe |location= |access-date=April 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared during the showcase of that episode.

==Personal life==
Barker married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Jo Gideon, on January 12, 1945. They remained married for 36&amp;nbsp;years until her death, on October 19, 1981, from lung cancer. They had no children, and Barker has not remarried. However, he was involved in a relationship with ''Price'' model [[Dian Parkinson]] from 1989 to 1991, which ended in legal action.

===Health===
Barker has had some minor health problems. Around 1982, he had a [[herniated disc]] and [[sciatica]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Greater health problems began in 1991 after he complained of [[Visual perception|vision]] problems while exercising. After a visit to his doctor, he was sent to see a [[neurologist]], who told Barker he had had a mild [[stroke]]. He recovered and went back to work.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

On September 16, 1999, Barker was in [[Washington, D.C.]], to testify before Congress regarding [[Captive elephants|HR 2929: the Captive Elephant Accident Prevention Act]], the proposed legislation that would ban [[elephant]]s from traveling shows (i.e., [[circuses]]). While preparing for the presentation, Barker experienced what he called "clumsiness" in his right hand. He was admitted to [[George Washington University Hospital]] and diagnosed with a partially blocked left [[carotid artery]]. Barker underwent [[carotid endarterectomy]] to remove the blockage. The procedure went well enough that he was able to return to work within the month.&lt;ref name=NYPost&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/1999/09/21/bob-barker-ok-after-3-hr-surgery/ |title=Bob Barker okay after 3-hr surgery |publisher=New York Post |date=September 21, 1999 |accessdate=July 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, Barker had two additional health crises after taping the 30th-season finale of ''The Price is Right''. While lying in the sun on May 30, 2002, he experienced a stroke and was hospitalized; six weeks later, on July 11, Barker underwent [[prostate]] surgery. Both hospitalizations occurred at [[George Washington University Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Both surgeries were successful.&lt;ref name=cbsint&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/daytime/price/about/justin/rroddy_medicalupdate.shtml |title=Rod Roddy Medical Update |publisher=CBS |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000744/http://www.cbs.com/daytime/price/about/justin/rroddy_medicalupdate.shtml |archivedate=October 1, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker has had several mild bouts with [[skin cancer]], a result of his frequent tanning. He consults a dermatologist regularly to make sure any cancers are caught and removed before they spread; they do not currently pose a threat to his life. During a televised interview, Barker told viewers, "I urge anyone who has spent some time in the sun, whether you're doing it now or not, go to a dermatologist once a year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/05/02/entertainment/main692422.shtml |title=Bob Barker Has Skin Cancer Again |publisher=CBS News |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2015, two police officers passing Barker's [[Los Angeles]]-area home saw him trip and fall on a sidewalk. They called an ambulance that brought him to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], where he received stitches for an injured forehead and was released; he also hurt his left knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/us/bob-barker-hospitalized |title=Bob Barker, TV legend, ex-'Price Is Right' host, recovering after fall| publisher=CNN.com |date=October 22, 2015 |accessdate=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker slipped and hit his head at home on June 19, 2017. His maid drove him to the emergency room, where he was checked and released. His representative said it was not as serious as his earlier fall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2017/06/19/bob-barker-recovering-after-slipping-and-hitting-his-head/22489721/ Kline, J.

===Lawsuits===
In 1994, former model [[Dian Parkinson]] filed a lawsuit against Barker alleging [[sexual harassment]] following a three-year affair while working on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. Parkinson, who alleged that she was extorted by threats of firing, later dropped her lawsuit, claiming the stress from the ordeal was damaging her health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/dian-parkinson/bio Dian Parkinson Bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213073820/http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/dian-parkinson/bio |date=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, model [[Holly Hallstrom]] left ''The Price Is Right'' and later filed suit against Barker for wrongful termination and malicious persecution claiming Barker had launched a media attack against her, allegedly stating that she was disruptive to the working atmosphere of the show. Barker dropped his case, but Hallstrom did not, finally ending in [[legal settlement|settlement]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrotheme.fr/en/portraits/V5ZG429LgMZf.htm|title=Astrology: Holly Hallstrom, date of birth: 1952/08/24, Horoscope, Astrological Portrait, Dominant Planets, Birth Data, Biography|publisher=astrotheme.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their testimonies in Barker's failed lawsuit against Hallstrom, models [[Janice Pennington]] and [[Kathleen Bradley]] were fired, and later received out-of-court financial settlements.&lt;ref name=Nerve&gt;[http://www.nerve.com/dispatches/doig/showcaseshowdown Showcase Showdown: Sex and war on the set of America's lustiest game show]. Nerve.com. Accessed December 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Paul Alter]] was removed from the show in 2000. Production assistants Sherrill Paris and Sharon Friem, who were also dismissed at the same time, each sued Barker for wrongful termination, as well as sexual harassment and sex discrimination. Both women ultimately received financial settlements.

In October 2007, Deborah Curling, a CBS employee assigned to ''The Price Is Right'', filed a lawsuit against CBS, Bob Barker and ''The Price Is Right'' producers, claiming that she was forced to quit her job after testifying against Barker in a wrongful-termination lawsuit brought by a previous show producer. Curling claimed that she was demoted to an "intolerable work environment" backstage which caused her to leave the job. Curling, who is black, also alleged that the show's producers, including Barker, created a hostile work environment in which black employees and contestants were discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title="Price Is Right" Employee Sues Bob Barker, Producers | agency=Associated Press | date=October 5, 2007 | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299553,00.html | accessdate=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Barker was removed from the lawsuit, and in September 2009, the lawsuit was dismissed.

===Animal rights===
Barker became a [[vegetarian]] in 1979. That same year, he began promoting [[animal rights]]. He was named national spokesman for "Be Kind to Animals Week" in May 1985. On [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' program, he credited his wife, Dorothy Jo, with causing him to become more aware of animal rights and to become a vegetarian, because she had done so. Bob remarked that Dorothy Jo was way ahead of her time in recognizing the rights of animals and that shortly after her death in October 1981 he took up animal rights in order to keep doing something that she had done.

Barker began ending some episodes (later every episode) of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' with the phrase: "This is Bob Barker reminding you to help control the pet population — have your pets [[Neutering|spayed or neutered]]." After Barker retired, [[Drew Carey]] continued his signature sign-off advocating neutering. Fellow game-show hosts [[Jack Barry (television)|Jack Barry]] and [[Bert Convy]] eventually followed Barker's lead in promoting animal rights on the air.&lt;ref name=CBSbio&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cbs.com/daytime/price/about/bios/cast_bios_bbarker.shtml |title=CBS Biography for Bob Barker |publisher=CBS |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321032422/http://www.cbs.com/daytime/price/about/bios/cast_bios_bbarker.shtml |archivedate=March 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker hosted the [[Miss USA]]/[[Miss Universe|Universe]] Pageants from 1967 to 1987. In 1987, he requested the removal of fur prizes and stepped down as host when those in charge of the pageant refused.&lt;ref name=CBSbio/&gt;

Barker's '''DJ&amp;T Foundation''', founded in 1994 and named after his late wife and mother, has contributed millions of dollars for animal neutering programs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117950232.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 Host's passion for pets more bit than bark] – ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' Sunday September 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and to fund animal rescue and park facilities all over the United States. He worked closely with [[Betty White]] as an advocate for animal rights.&lt;ref name=CBSbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christinepalma.com/2007/06/08/bob-barker-host-of-price-is-right-retires-after-50-years/ Bob Barker host of "Price Is Right" retires after 50 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211034431/http://www.christinepalma.com/2007/06/08/bob-barker-host-of-price-is-right-retires-after-50-years/ |date=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009, reports indicated that Barker threatened to not attend the 2009 Game Show Awards, where he was to receive a lifetime achievement award, because White would be attending. The reason for the conflict, according to the report, was over the proper treatment of an elephant at the Los Angeles Zoo. White instead did not attend and pre-recorded her comments that she was scheduled to make about Mark Goodson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2009/05/30/bob-barker-almost-a-no-show-at-game-show-awards-because-of-feud/ |title=Bob Barker almost a no-show at Game Show Awards because of feud with Betty White |publisher=Tvsquad.com |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Barker donated $1 million to [[Columbia University School of Law]] to support the study of animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2005_older/2004/nov/bobbarker_gift |title=Columbia Law School: Bob Barker Gives Law School $1 Million for Animal Rights Law |publisher=Law.columbia.edu |date=December 2004 |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gift has funded an adjunct professorship in animal rights law at Columbia and helped fund a student clinic in environmental law.

Barker also supported [[United Activists for Animal Rights]], and together with the group, publicly accused several media projects and the [[American Humane Association]] of animal mistreatment or the condoning of animal mistreatment, a tactic which resulted in a major lawsuit against him and the group, accusing him of spurious allegations.&lt;ref name="SPEAKING"&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20121207,00.html Speaking Up for 'Abused' Animals, Bob Barker Is Hit with a Lawsuit] – ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', September 18, 1989, Vol. 32, No. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Barker wrote Chief Michell Hicks of the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] asking that their [[Qualla Boundary|reservation's]] [[bear]] exhibit be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlos.com/shared/newsroom/top_stories/wlos_vid_418.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728063233/http://www.wlos.com/shared/newsroom/top_stories/wlos_vid_418.shtml |archivedate=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 28, 2009, he visited the reservation and saw one of the three zoos, calling the bears' living situation "inhumane". [[PETA]] set up the visit after Barker heard from [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Bill Young]], (R) [[Florida]], whose wife had been "appalled" by what she saw. Annette Tarnowski, the tribe's attorney general, said a federal inspector had found nothing wrong in May 2009 at two of the zoos, and that the tribe had dealt with the few violations at the third. Hicks made no promises and threatened to ban PETA if they made more trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090729/NEWS01/907290316/1009/news01

In January 2010, [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] announced that it had secretly purchased and outfitted a ship to interdict Japanese whaling operations in the [[Southern Ocean]] using $5,000,000 provided by Barker.

==Autobiography==
Bob Barker has written his autobiography, assisted by former ''L.A. Times'' book review editor Digby Diehl, titled ''Priceless Memories''. It was published on April 6, 2009, and features stories from his early life as well as stories and experiences in the 50 years of his television career.&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Priceless-Memories-Digby-Diehl/dp/1600245536 |title=Priceless Memories (9781600245534): Digby Diehl, Bob Barker: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also then reported that Barker would appear on ''The Price Is Right'' to promote his book. His initial appearance was scheduled for the March 2, 2009, taping. However, the taping was postponed until March 25, due to host Drew Carey's bout with [[pneumonia]]. The episode aired on April 16, during which Barker appeared during the [[The Showcase|Showcases]] to promote the book.&lt;ref name="Steward Levine"/&gt; Carey stated in an interview that the show stopped taping for over an hour as the crowd continued to give Barker a standing ovation, and to allow the audience to ask questions about what Barker was doing during his retirement.

In 2009, Pennsylvania Senator [[Arlen Specter]] and seven co-sponsors introduced a resolution to express the sense of Congress that sessions of the Court should be televised.&lt;ref name=s339/&gt; In 2009, Specter also introduced a bill that would require open sessions of the Court to be televised.&lt;ref name=s446/&gt; Upon introducing his bill to require televising the Supreme Court of the United States proceedings, Arlen Specter announced, "[t]he Supreme Court makes pronouncements on constitutional and federal law that have direct impacts on the rights of Americans. Those rights would be substantially enhanced by televising the oral arguments of the Court so that the public can see and hear the issues presented." &lt;ref name=spector&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091107182951/http://specter.senate.gov/public/ "Specter Introduces Resolution to Televise Supreme Court Proceedings"] press release (November 5, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Eight U.S. Senators co-sponsored Spector's resolution.&lt;ref name=s339&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SE00339:@@@P|/bss/111search.html  S.RES.339] on the [[Library of Congress]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ted Poe]], R-TX2, introduced a related bill in the House of Representatives in January 2009.&lt;ref name=h429&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR00429:|/bss/111search.html  H.R.429] on the [[Library of Congress]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The only exception to televising the Court under this legislation would be if a majority of justices decided that "allowing such coverage in a particular case would violate the [[due process]] rights of any of the parties involved."&lt;ref name=s446&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN00446:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp;|/bss/111search.html  S.446] on the [[Library of Congress]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Supporters of Specter's proposal reason that other government proceedings are already televised, including sessions of both the House of Representative and the Senate, covered most frequently by [[C-SPAN]].&lt;ref name=fdu&gt;[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s PublicMind Poll [http://publicmind.fdu.edu/courttv/ "Public Says Televising Court Is Good for Democracy"] press release (March 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  By televising the Court, they argue that Americans would have more access to the most important institution in the U.S. judiciary, which would result in a more open and transparent government.&lt;ref name=tong /&gt; Bruce Peabody of Fairleigh Dickinson University contends that televising the Supreme Court of the United States proceedings can change the way Americans view public policy by bringing greater attention to the Court.&lt;ref name=csm&gt;Peabody, Bruce [http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0928/p09s02-coop.html "Legislating Supreme Court TV"] ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' (September 28, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2010 New York Times editorial  states that public access to the court would give Americans the opportunity to get a closer look at how a powerful branch of government operates. It adds that the televising the Court would hold presidents accountable for the justices they nominate.  The editorial reasons, "[r]ight now, we see the justices during their confirmation hearings and rarely after that."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/opinion/14sun2.html Your Reality TV] ''[[The New York Times]]'' editorial (March 13, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

During her confirmation hearing in 2009, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] indicated that she is open to the idea of televising court proceedings, stating, "I have had positive experiences with cameras. When I have been asked to join experiments of using cameras in the courtroom, I have participated. I have volunteered." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-span.org/CamerasInCourt/default.aspx Cameras in the Court] on the [[C-SPAN]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Opponents of Specter's proposal believe that requiring the proceedings of the Supreme Court of the United States to be televised is a threat to judicial independence and, thus, the separation of powers.  In addition, several justices of the Court have objected to the proposed legislation, including Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] who argues that the measure would not align with the "etiquette" and "deference" that should "apply between branches."&lt;ref name=michigan&gt;Peabody, Bruce [http://www.michiganlawreview.org/articles/constitutional-etiquette-and-the-fate-of-supreme-court-tv "Constitutional Etiquette and the Fate of 'Supreme Court TV'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100321054323/http://www.michiganlawreview.org/articles/constitutional-etiquette-and-the-fate-of-supreme-court-tv# |date=2010-03-21 }} ''Michigan Law Review'' (ndg)&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, some justices believe televising the proceedings would change the way they act in the courtroom.  Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] also contends that televising Court proceedings would reduce the level of anonymity that justices now have and could raise security concerns.&lt;ref name=tong /&gt;   Opponents also believe that television coverage would also take away from the mystery of the court and cause the public to misinterpret the Court and its processes.&lt;ref name=tong /&gt;

Scholars have also considered the constitutionality of televising the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=csm /&gt;&lt;ref name=michigan /&gt;&lt;ref name=debate&gt;Peabody, Bruce and Gant, Scott. [http://www.pennumbra.com/debates/pdfs/Televising_Supreme_Court.pdf "Debate: Congress's Power to Compel the Televising of Supreme Court Proceedings"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106004545/http://www.pennumbra.com/debates/pdfs/Televising_Supreme_Court.pdf# |date=2010-01-06 }} ''University of Pennsylvania Law Review'' Vol. 156:46 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peabody, Bruce "Supreme Court TV: Televising the least accountable branch?,' 33 J. Legis. 144, 147-148. (2007)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
In March 2010, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s PublicMind Poll found in a national poll that more than 60% of voters think that televising the Supreme Court of the United States proceedings would be "good for democracy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2010/03/the-morning-wrap-3.html "The Morning Wrap"] on The BLT: the Blog of ''[[Legal Times]]'' (March 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, Peter. [http://c-spanvideo.org/program/292428-3 "Washington Journal: Supreme Court Proceedings on Television"] video on the [[C-SPAN]] website (March 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; 26% think that televising the proceedings would "undermine the authority of the court." &lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

Voters have mixed opinions on the effect of television coverage on court decisions.  While 45% say that televising Court's proceedings would be good "because the judges would consider public opinion more" in making decisions, 31% say TV would be bad because justices would consider public opinion ''too much.''  25% say are not sure or say that televising the Court would have no effect on its legal decisions.&lt;ref name=fdu /&gt; While a majority of voters presently watch government proceedings infrequently if at all, half of voters (50%) say they would watch the Supreme Court of the United States' proceedings sometimes or regularly if they were televised. Only 10% say they’d never watch the court.&lt;ref name=fdu /&gt;

[[Peter J. Woolley|Dr. Peter Woolley]], director of the FDU poll, said, “Voters are certainly curious about the court, which is both powerful and largely out of the public eye. After the novelty wears off, the primary audience might be lawyers and lobbyists, rather than any broad swath of voters. Most voters will only see it when commercial media select the most controversial bits and pieces.” &lt;ref name=fdu /&gt; But Peabody disagreed, “The rationale for televising the court is not to guarantee the public will watch it, but to give democracy’s citizens more opportunities to educate themselves. It is unlikely people will know more about the court by seeing it less.” &lt;ref name=fdu /&gt;

Noting the FDU poll, the editors of ''The New York Times'' subsequently opined that televising the Court "would allow Americans to see for themselves how an extremely powerful part of their government works" and "allow voters to hold presidents accountable for the quality of justices they nominate.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; In turn, Diana Schaub of Loyola University criticized the ''Times'' for insisting that the justices of the Supreme Court ought to be “YouTubed” like everyone else.  She contends that the Court is already an open book, the most transparent branch of government.  Rather than issuing only a verdict, Schaub states, the Court justifies its rulings with detailed opinions that are immediately available to the public.  She further notes that only a small slice of the Court’s work would be revealed on camera if televising oral arguments were required, adding that the “un-telegenic activities” of the Court, which include choosing cases, poring over briefs, writing memos and drafts, and actually deciding cases would not be seen.  Furthermore, Schaub declares that the only way for the public to truly have access to the Court is to “join the justices in the difficult work of legal interpretation.”  She states that most Americans would not be willing or even capable of doing this.&lt;ref&gt;Schaub, Diana.

{{Nihongo|'''Cosquín en Japón'''|コスキン・エン・ハポン|Kosukin en Hapon}} is a three-day South American folk festival held annually in [[Kawamata, Fukushima]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.town.kawamata.fukushima.jp/cosquin/index.html|title= コスキン・エン・ハポン|trans-title=Cosquín en Japón|date= |work= |publisher= Kawamata-machi|location= |language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Cosquín en Japón" is derived from the [[Cosquín Festival]] held in [[Cosquín]], Argentina.

In 1955, {{nihongo|Yasumitsu Naganuma|長沼 康光}}, a resident of Kawamata and Argentinian folk enthusiast, formed Norte Japón, otherwise known as the {{nihongo|Northern Japan South American Music Alliance|北日本中南米音楽連盟}}. In 1975, the Alliance held the first Cosquín en Japón event at the {{nihongo|Kawamata Welfare Center|川俣町福祉センター}}, with 13 amateur groups performing.

In 1981, the festival was moved to the Kawamata Central Public Hall, due to an increase in the number of performing groups, and in 2002 was expanded to become a three-day festival. Top performers and professionals from Japan and overseas now attend the festival, which is currently the largest Andean music festival in the country. In 2006, 161 groups performed, making it the largest Cosquín yet.

==International exchange==
Increased awareness of Cosquín en Japón has deepened international ties with Argentina and the city of Cosquín. During the Japanese hosting of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], residents of Kawamata, at the urging of Argentina, formed a [[Ōendan|Japanese-style cheer club]] to cheer on the Argentinian team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fct.co.jp/news/200099.html?start=1012|title= アルゼンチンまず一勝　各地で応援イベント|trans-title=Argentinian Cheering Events|date= 2002-06-02|work= |publisher= Fukushima Chuo TV News|location= |language= Japanese|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentinian [[ambassador]] to Japan and the mayor of Cosquín have paid visits to Kawamata. Residents of Kawamata, including the mayor, have also visited Cosquín. Since 1999, Cosquín en Japón has held an annual contest to send representatives of Japan to the original Cosquín Festival in Argentina.

'''''Dear Esther''''' is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] exploration and [[Adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[The Chinese Room]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]]. First released in 2008 as a [[free-to-play]] [[mod (video gaming)|mod]]ification for the [[Source (game engine)|Source]] game engine, the game was entirely redeveloped for a commercial release in 2012. Spurning traditional game design, ''Dear Esther'' features no puzzles or tasks. The player's only objective is to explore an unnamed island in the [[Hebrides]], listening to a troubled man read a series of letters to his deceased wife. Details of her mysterious death are revealed as the player moves throughout the island.

''Dear Esther'' was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on 20 September 2016 and re-released for PC/Mac 14 February 2017 under the name "Dear Esther: Landmark Edition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/dear_esther/news/dear_esther_is_coming_to_ps4_and_xbox_one_later_this_year_2.html|title=Dear Esther is coming to PS4 &amp; Xbox One later this year|first=James|last=Orry|work=VideoGamer.com|date=6 April 2016|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-08-25-dear-esther-walks-to-ps4-xbox-one-next-month|title=Dear Esther walks to PS4, Xbox One next month|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=VideoGamer.com|date=25 August 2016|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/blog/blog/dear-esther-landmark-edition-hits-pc-and-mac-tomorrow-at-6pm-gmt|title=Dear Esther: Landmark Edition hits PC and MAC tomorrow at 6pm GMT!|first=Dan|last=Pinchbeck|publisher=[[The Chinese Room]]|date=13 February 2017|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[spiritual successor]], titled ''[[Everybody's Gone to the Rapture]]'', was released for [[PlayStation 4]] in August 2015 and for [[Microsoft Windows]] in April 2016.

==Gameplay and plot==
The "gameplay" in ''Dear Esther'' is minimal, the only object being to explore an uninhabited [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] island, listening to an anonymous man read a series of letter fragments to a woman named Esther. The letters suggest that Esther was his wife and that she is dead, killed in a car crash.&lt;ref name=accident&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dear Esther|developer=The Chinese Room|date=2012|platform=PC|quote='''Narrator''': I first saw him sat by the side of the road. I was waiting for you to be cut out of the wreckage. The car looked like it had been dropped from a great height. The guts of the engine spilled over the tarmac, like water underground.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dear Esther|developer=The Chinese Room|date=2012|platform=PC|quote='''Narrator''': [...] and you were rendered opaque by the car of a drunk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the player reaches a new location on the island, the game plays a new letter fragment relating to that area. Different fragments are played in each playthrough of the game, revealing different aspects of the story each time. Several other unseen characters are referred to by the narrator: a man named Donnelly, who charted the island in the past;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dear Esther|developer=The Chinese Room|date=2012|platform=PC|quote='''Narrator''': Reading Donnelly by the weak afternoon sunlight. He landed on the south side of the island, followed the path to the bay and climbed the mount. He did not find the caves and he did not chart the north side. I think this is why his understanding of the island is flawed, incomplete. He stood on the mount and only wondered momentarily how to descend. But then, he didn’t have my reasons.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul, who is suggested to be the drunk driver in the accident in which Esther died;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dear Esther|developer=The Chinese Room|date=2012|platform=PC|quote='''Narrator''': Is this what Paul saw through his windscreen? Not Lot’s wife, looking over her shoulder, but a scar in the hillside, falling away to black, forever.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a shepherd named Jakobson who lived on the island in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dear Esther|developer=The Chinese Room|date=2012|platform=PC|quote='''Narrator''': The bothy was constructed originally in the early 1700s. By then, shepherding had formalised into a career. The first habitual shepherd was a man called Jakobson, from a lineage of migratory Scandinavians. He was not considered a man of breeding by the mainlanders. He came here every summer whilst building the bothy, hoping, eventually, that becoming a man of property would secure him a wife and a lineage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the player explores the island, they find the derelict remains of buildings, a shipwreck, and a cave system whose walls are adorned with images resembling chemical diagrams, circuit diagrams, neurons and bacteria. At various points a figure is seen walking away from the player in the distance, but disappears before they can be reached. The identities of the characters become more blurred as the game progresses, as the narration moves between topics and relates the characters in different ways.&lt;ref name=pcgamer /&gt; The ambiguity of the randomly played letter fragments forces the player to draw their own conclusions of the story.&lt;ref name=gamespot /&gt;

At the game's end, the player reaches the radio mast atop the island's peak and climbs a ladder to the top of the tower during a final monologue by the narrator. As the player jumps off and falls to the shore below, their shadow becomes that of a bird. The player soars through the island's bay before flying low over an array of paper boats in the water—the many letters the narrator had written to Esther.

==Development==
[[File:Dear Esther Screenshot Large.jpg|thumbnail|A screenshot showing the cave in ''Dear Esther''. The game garnered praise from critics for its graphical detail.]]
The original rendition of ''Dear Esther'' was one of several [[Mod (video gaming)|modifications]] (mods){{clarify|date=February 2018|reason=Of what?}} developed by [[The Chinese Room]] while the studio was still a research project at the [[University of Portsmouth]]. The project was funded by a grant from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and led by Dan Pinchbeck, a professor and lecturer at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[University of Portsmouth]]|title=Commercial success for computer game|date=2012-02-28|accessdate=2014-04-06|url=http://www.port.ac.uk/uopnews/2012/02/28/commercial-success-for-computer-game/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story and script were composed by Pinchbeck, who cited the works of [[William S. Burroughs]] as influential in the writing: "...&amp;nbsp;looking at the way William Burroughs worked structurally was a big influence, but also I was really interested in moving towards a quite image-heavy, symbolic, poetic use of language rather than the normal descriptive tone we find in games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-27-where-literature-and-gaming-collide|title=Where literature and gaming collide|last=McMullan|first=Thomas|date=27 July 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent games artist Robert Briscoe began work on completely redeveloping ''Dear Esther'' in 2009, with the full support of Pinchbeck.&lt;ref name=remake_start&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Briscoe|publisher=LittleLostPoly|title=Mods and the Motherland!|date=2009-05-03|accessdate=2011-12-08|url=http://www.littlelostpoly.co.uk/mods-and-the-motherland/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briscoe and The Chinese Room worked in parallel on the game's [[Video game remake|remake]], with much of the level design completed solely by Briscoe based on concept art done by Ben Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Briscoe|publisher=LittleLostPoly|title=The Magic of Concept Art|date=2009-05-24|accessdate=2012-02-15|url=http://www.littlelostpoly.co.uk/the-magic-of-concept-art/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In redesigning the island's landscape, Briscoe aimed to eliminate the confusion caused by the original game's lay-out, and to fill out the environment with "richer, visually interesting" features to improve on the barren landscape of the original mod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Briscoe|publisher=LittleLostPoly|title=Smoothing out the Wrinkles|date=2009-05-10|accessdate=2012-03-06|url=http://www.littlelostpoly.co.uk/smoothing-out-the-wrinkles/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, while the game was still in development, The Chinese Room lost the financial backing of the University it had hitherto relied on.

Robert Briscoe announced in a blog post, on 14 February 2014, that he had begun porting ''Dear Esther'' to the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity Engine]] two months prior to this announcement. He has cited an abandoned native Linux port, escalating bugs in the Mac OS X port, spiraling additional licensing costs of the Source Engine to be some of the reasons behind the move to the Unity Engine. Development plans include "a solid, high quality, Linux and Mac build, and then eventually PC" and beta releases for existing Humble Store and Humble Bundle customers to evaluate and test. He also mentions that the development is still experimental and that there will not be any Steam or other build replacements until the team are satisfied with the quality of this port.&lt;ref name="dear_esther_unity" /&gt; In another blog post, on 11 March 2014, announcing his employment with [[Valve Corporation]], Robert also mentions that the bulk of the port has been completed, with just a little of the back-end and scripting development remaining and that he should be able to finish the port in his spare time with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Briscoe|date=2014-03-11|title=Leaving The Comfort Zone|publisher=littlelostpoly.co.uk|accessdate=2015-11-06|url=http://www.littlelostpoly.co.uk/leaving-the-comfort-zone/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The voice of ''Dear Esther''{{'}}s narrator was performed by Nigel Carrington, whose script was extended for the remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Pinchbeck|date=2011-04-08|title=Downloading in Background|publisher=Dear-Esther.com|accessdate=2012-02-15|url=http://dear-esther.com/?p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's music was composed by Jessica Curry, a freelance music composer and co-director of The Chinese Room. In the remake's development, Curry overhauled and re-orchestrated the score to be fuller and longer, featuring more instruments and reaching nearly double the length of the original soundtrack. The music of the original game was released for free on 8 July 2008, shortly after the mod itself was released,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/dear-esther/downloads/dear-esther-soundtrack|title=Dear Esther Soundtrack|publisher=[[ModDB]]|accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the remastered soundtrack was released on 14 February 2012, via [[Amazon.com]], [[iTunes]], and [[Bandcamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curry|first1=Jessica|title=Dear Esther|url=https://jessicacurry.bandcamp.com/album/dear-esther|website=bandcamp.com|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Original===
The original mod release of ''Dear Esther'' was selected for the Animation Exhibition at the 2008 [[Prix Ars Electronica]] and made the Top 100 of [[Mod DB]]'s Mod of the Year 2008.&lt;ref name=top100&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 100 Best Released Mods and Indies of 2008|accessdate=2011-12-10|publisher=[[Mod DB]]|url=http://www.moddb.com/events/2008-mod-of-the-year-awards/top100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the game won the award for Best World/Story at the [[Indiecade|IndieCade]] Independent Game awards.&lt;ref name=indiecade_award&gt;{{cite web|title=Dear Esther wins Best World/Story at IndieCade 2009|url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/dear-esther/news/dear-esther-wins-best-worldstory-at-indiecade-2009|publisher=[[Mod DB]]|date=2009-10-03|accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the mod for Honest Gamers in 2009, Lewis Denby praised the game's original tone, saying that the game "taps into an emotion that few games dare to approach: ''un''happiness" and stated that Curry's soundtrack created "an impressively ethereal atmosphere".&lt;ref name=honest&gt;{{cite web|title=Dear Esther review|first=Lewis|last=Denby|publisher=Honest Gamers|date=2009-02-08|accessdate=2011-12-10|url=http://www.honestgamers.com/reviews/7778.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite commendations for its premise and story, the original mod release received complaints of poor level design and numerous [[Video game glitch|glitches]] in moving about the terrain.&lt;ref name=honest /&gt;&lt;ref name="esoteric"&gt;{{cite web

The 2012 remastered ''Dear Esther'' has garnered mainly positive reviews from critics, receiving an average score of 71.29% based on 28 reviews and 75/100 based on 37 reviews on review aggregators [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=gamerankings/&gt;&lt;ref name=metacritic/&gt; Despite questioning whether it truly constitutes a video game, reviewers praised the game's originality and commented favourably on the emphasis on the story; [[IGN]] stated that the game "will leave you feeling edified, contemplative, and possibly even emotionally moved."&lt;ref name=ign /&gt; Strategy Informer awarded the game 9/10, calling it "one of the most haunting and well-executed titles of this or any other generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dear Esther Review|publisher=Strategy Informer|accessdate=2012-02-18|first=Emmanuel|last=Brown|url=http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/dearesther/1791/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics were divided by the suitability of the video game medium for conveying the story of ''Dear Esther''. Maxwell McGee of [[GameSpot]] claimed that "[the] story in ''Dear Esther'' works well in video game form—possibly more than as a book or movie." McGee went further to claim that "video games allow for pacing and discovery that would be impossible to reproduce elsewhere."&lt;ref name=gamespot/&gt; Reviewing for [[Destructoid]], Allistair Pinsof claimed the opposite, stating that the game "would be better as a short film", although doubted whether "if ''Dear Esther'' were a short film, if its vague plot and predictable conclusion would be effective."&lt;ref name=destructoid/&gt; [[Eurogamer]] also offered criticism of the plot, calling the writing "purple in places and wantonly obscure in ways which will draw accusations of pretentiousness", and joked that "the [game's] tendency to deploy extended car metaphors occasionally steers the writing into oncoming traffic." However, the review commended the lasting impact of the story, stating that "its two-hour long chill will remain in your bones for a long while after."&lt;ref name=eurogamer/&gt;

The limited interactivity between the player and the narrative in ''Dear Esther'' also divided reviewers. Pinsof stated that "[the] ironic thing is that the most pedestrian of stories can be convincing when coupled with intelligently applied interaction—something ''Dear Esther'' stubbornly stands against."&lt;ref name=destructoid/&gt; [[PC Gamer]] did not find the basic gameplay to be a problem, stating that “the lack of puzzles is necessary: it’s crucial to the experience that you’re allowed to keep moving at your own pace. […] Without puzzles, the visuals and narrative are allowed to take precedence.”&lt;ref name=pcgamer /&gt;

The level of detail in ''Dear Esther''{{'}}s environment was given broad praise by critics. Reviewing for [[bit-tech]], Joe Martin called the game "a graphical masterpiece", commenting that "what gives ''Dear Esther''{{'}}s visuals such a poignant edge is how masterfully it extends the sense of loneliness and isolation that's conveyed in the script".&lt;ref name="bit-tech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dear Esther Review|publisher=[[bit-tech]]|first=Joe|last=Martin|date=2012-02-14|accessdate=2012-03-29|url= http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/pc/2012/02/14/dear-esther-review/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Tom Hoggins noted the effect of the game's more minor details, stating that "[the] broad strokes of ''Dear Esther's'' visuals are majestic, but the finer details on the landscape are the most revealing."&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

At the 2012 [[Independent Games Festival]], ''Dear Esther'' received the prize for "Excellence in Visual Arts".&lt;ref name=igf&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Independent Games Festival Winners|publisher=[[Independent Games Festival]]|accessdate=2012-03-29|url=http://www.igf.com/2012finalistswinners.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208134900/http://www.igf.com/2012finalistswinners.html|archivedate=2012-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2012 Awards, ''[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]'' awarded ''Dear Esther'' the prize for "Best use of narrative".&lt;ref name="french1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry's finest take top game dev honours|publisher=''[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]''|accessdate=2012-07-16|first=Michael|last=French|date=2012-07-12|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/41389/Industrys-finest-take-top-game-dev-honours}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[The Independent Games Developers Association|TIGA]] Games Industry Awards 2012, the game won the "Originality Award" along with the prizes for "Best Action/Adventure game", "Best Visual Design", "Best Audio Design" and "Best Debut Game".&lt;ref name="tiga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiga.org/news/press-releases/tiga-games-industry-awards-2012-winners-revealed |title=TIGA Games Industry Awards 2012 Winners Revealed|publisher=[[The Independent Games Developers Association|TIGA]]|accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was nominated for five awards in the [[9th British Academy Video Games Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bafta Video Game Awards 2013—nominees announced|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|first=Keith|last=Stuart|date=2013-02-12|accessdate=2013-03-02|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/feb/12/bafta-video-game-awards-nominations-2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10263">In music, a '''duodecet'''—sometimes '''duodectet''', or '''duodecimette'''—is a composition which requires twelve musicians for a performance, or a musical group that consists of twelve people. In jazz, such a group of twelve players is sometimes called a "twelvetet". The corresponding German word is '''duodezett'''. The French equivalent form, '''douzetuor''', is virtually unknown (in sharp contrast to ''dixtuor'', the French word for [[Decet (music)|decet]]). Unlike some other musical ensembles such as the [[string quartet]], there is no established or standard set of instruments in a duodecet.

==History==

Of the ensemble types named according to the number of musicians in the group, the decet, undecet, duodecet, tredecet, etc., are names less common in music than smaller groupings ([[quartet]], [[quintet]], etc., up to [[Nonet (music)|none]]t). In the eighteenth century, twelve-part ensembles were most often encountered in the genre of the wind serenade, [[divertimento]], [[nocturne]], or [[partita]]—for example, [[Josef Reicha]]'s ''Parthia ex D'', for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 3 horns, 2 bassoons, and double bass, and the partitas for the same instrumentation by Reicha's colleague Johann Georg Feldmayr {{harv|Gerhart|2011}}. In fact, the titles "[[serenade]]" and "[[suite (music)|suite]]" continue through the 19th century to be the preferred term for ensembles of twelve or thirteen instruments, especially winds (e.g., [[Wilhelm Berger]]'s op. 102 for 12 winds, [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s op. 24 for 11 or 12 winds, [[Max Reger]]'s Serenade for 12 winds, or [[Richard Strauss]]'s opp. 4 and 7, for 13 winds). The word "duodecet" remains rare as a genre title in the 20th century (exceptions are found amongst the works of Polish composers [[Barbara Buczek]] and [[Bogusław Schaeffer]]), where works for twelve instruments or singers most often are given either a true title, or a genre title describing the form (e.g., "[[Concertino (composition)|concertino]]", "suite", "[[Variation (music)|variations]]"), often followed by a designator such as "for twelve instruments".

The three "twelve-part inventions", variations 3 (12 solo violins), 5 (10 violas and 2 double basses), and 11 (12 wind instruments), in [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Variations (Stravinsky)|Variations: Aldous Huxley in memoriam]]'' (1963–64) have been designated "duodecets" by his biographer Eric Walter White ({{harvnb|White|1965|loc=19–20}}; {{harvnb|White|1979|loc=535–36}}).

* Devin Brooke as '''Natalie Reed''': 17 years old. A mind-reader that can both hear other people's thoughts and, through eye-contact, see and feel their memories. Lives with her maternal grandmother. Other relatives include a mother, step-father and twin brother that currently reside out-of-state.
* Anna Rubley as '''Gretchen Summers''': 18 years old. Electronic symbiant and photographic memory. She lives with her mother, Francine Summers. They were abandoned by her father who has history of violent tendencies.
* Nik Isbelle as '''Kris Freeman''': 17 years old. Her abilities allow her to generate an energy pulse rendering those nearby unconscious. She lives with her mother, Bonnie Freeman, and her sister, Kimmi. Both protective and impulsive. Kris acts as the primary care-giver for her young sister.
* Allie Shea as '''Kimmi Freeman''': 12 years old. Her abilities allow her to project her consciousness forward in time allowing her to perceive future events. She lives with her mother, Bonnie Freeman, and her sister Kris. Despite her mother's physical presence, Kris is her primary caregiver.
* Katie Orr as '''Riley Marks''':18 years old. Her physical appearance changes based on observers’ perception. Always wearing headphones, Riley considers her ability more of a burden than a benefit.
* Sarah Colbert as '''Evey Simms''': 15 years old. Her abilities are unknown until episode 6, when she reveals that people who hear her verbal commands must involuntarily follow them. Due to a traumatic incident with her power as a young girl, Evey doesn't talk and has been separated from her mother and homeless for over three years.

'''Euro War''', also known as '''Macaroni Combat''', '''Macaroni War''', '''Spaghetti Combat''', or '''Spaghetti War''', is a broad sub[[genre]] of [[war film]] that emerged in the mid-1960s, so named because most were produced and directed by European [[co-production (filmmaking)|co-production]]s, and most notably by [[Cinema of Italy|Italians]].&lt;ref name="grindhousedatabase.com"&gt;http://www.grindhousedatabase.com/index.php/Macaroni_Combat&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical team was made up of an Italian director, Italo-Spanish technical staff, and a cast of Italian and Spanish actors and sometimes German and French, sometimes a minor or fading [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[movie star|star]]. The films were primarily shot in Europe and later, the Philippines.

==History==
From the mid-1960s much like the Italian [[Spaghetti Western|spaghetti western]], the Macaroni Combat film mimicked the success of American films such as ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' and ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]''. Like spaghetti westerns, Euro War films were characterized by their production in the Italian language, low budgets, added violence, and a recognizable highly fluid and minimalist cinematography. This was partly intentional and partly the context and cultural background of the filmmakers.  Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the films were almost all set during [[World War II]] with a few about mercenaries in Africa following the success of ''[[Dark of the Sun]]'' and later, ''[[The Wild Geese]]''. In the 1980s most entries in the genre were set during the [[Vietnam War]] following the success of ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.&lt;ref name="grindhousedatabase.com" /&gt;

Two popular examples of the Italian-made World War II films were ''[[Anzio (film)|Anzio]]'' (1968) and ''[[Hornets' Nest]]'' (1970) with their A-list cast members. Today, one of the better-known films to fit the Macaroni Combat archetype is the 1978 film ''[[The Inglorious Bastards]]'' directed by [[Enzo G. Castellari]]. Influenced heavily by the aforementioned 1967 American film, ''The Dirty Dozen'', it would later inspire [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 2009 film ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', an American-produced film influenced by the genre as a whole.

In [[American comic book]]s and other stories with a long history, '''first appearance''' refers to the first issue to feature a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]]. These issues are often highly valued by collectors due to their rarity and iconic status.

==Reader interest in first appearances==
[[Comic book collecting|Collectors]] value first appearances for their rarity and historical value, while many regular readers are interested in viewing how their favorite characters were originally portrayed. Reprints of first appearances are often published, both as single comic books and in [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]], usually with other early appearances of the character. [[Marvel Comics]]' "Essential" line has become popular by giving readers an affordable glimpse into characters' early history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/44295 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060126234925/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/44295 |archivedate=January 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, first appearances tell the [[origin story]] for the character, although some, such as [[Batman]] and [[Green Goblin]], remained dubious figures for several issues. [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern]] writers prefer to tell a character’s origin across an entire story arc or keep a newly introduced character mysterious until a "secret origin" issue. Some fans consider this a [[gimmick]] and prefer the older method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yetanothercomicsblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/origin-stories.html|title=Yet Another Comics Blog: Origin Stories|first=Dave|last=Carter|date=January 20, 2005|website=yetanothercomicsblog.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic merit of many first appearances is debatable. The events portrayed in most famous first appearances are continuously [[retcon]]ed, [[reboot (continuity)|rebooted]] and/or expanded upon by subsequent writers. Like many [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden]] and [[Silver Age of Comic Books|silver]] age comics, first appearances often become dated and do not fit the modern portrayal of the character.

However, some first appearances are considered classics. 1990s-era [[Spider-Man]] writer [[Howard Mackie]] said that his favorite story featuring the character was his first appearance and origin story in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962), stating that writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] "gave us everything we needed, I wanted or could ask for in the least possible space. Every single person who retells the origin never improves on the original, they simply expand it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/interviews/mackie4.htm|title=Spider-Man Crawl Space Interview: Howard Mackie|author=|date=|website=www.spidermancrawlspace.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monetary value of first appearance issues==
First appearances of popular characters are among the most valuable comic books in existence.  Of the "ten most valuable comic books" listed in the spring 2002 issue of ''[[The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]'', seven are first appearances of popular [[superhero]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemstonepub.com/hake/toptoys/comics.html Gemstonepub.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207182528/http://www.gemstonepub.com/hake/toptoys/comics.html |date=February 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 (October 1939), is the first appearance of the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Golden Age Human Torch]] but is more noteworthy as the first comic book published by industry giant [[Marvel Comics]].

It can take many years for a character to attain sufficient popularity after their first appearance to be considered "iconic." By the point a character reaches that level of popularity, it is common for few copies of their first appearance issues to remain. Furthermore, even fewer of those remaining copies will be in the pristine condition prized by collectors. What few remain can be worth thousands of [[U.S. dollar|dollars]] to interested collectors. For example, in 2004, a copy of ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (January 1940), the first appearance of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], was [[auction]]ed for $42,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=4275|title=CBR.com - The World's Top Destination For Comic, Movie &amp; TV news|author=|date=|website=CBR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a copy of ''Captain America Comics'' #1 (March 1941), the first appearance of [[Captain America]] sold for $64,400.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.heritagegalleries.com/common/info/press/default.php?ReleaseID=510 Heritagegalleries.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218094111/http://comics.heritagegalleries.com/common/info/press/default.php?ReleaseID=510 |date=February 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, another copy of ''Flash Comics'' #1 sold privately for $450,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itsalljustcomics.com/2010/03/16/edgar-churchmile-high-flash-comics-1-sells-for-450000/|title=Edgar Church/Mile High Flash Comics #1 Sells for $450,000|author=|date=March 16, 2010|website=itsalljustcomics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first appearance of [[Superman]], [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] (June 1938), has been regarded as the "[[holy grail]]" of comic books, due to its cultural significance and rarity (fewer than one hundred copies are thought to exist).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/05/comic-book-containing-supermans-debut-sold-for-nearly-one-millio/|title=Comic book containing Superman's debut sold for nearly one million dollars|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superman is widely considered to have solidified, if not created, the superhero archetype; therefore, his first appearance is not only important to fans of the character but to fans of superheroes and comic books as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Holt | first=Douglas B. | year=2004 | title=How Brands Become Icons: The Principles of Cultural Branding | publisher=[[Harvard Business School Press]] | location=[[Boston]], MA | page=1 | isbn=1-57851-774-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-preserved copies of ''Action'' ''Comics'' #1 have been sold at auction for record-breaking prices. A copy graded at 8.0 ("very fine") on the 10-point scale typically used by collectors was sold at auction for $1,000,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/action-comics-no-1-sale-pushes-superman-to-new-heights/|title=Action Comics No. 1 sale pushes Superman to new heights|date=February 23, 2010|newspaper=Hero Complex - movies, comics, pop culture - Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even a copy graded at a much lower 5.5 ("fine minus") sold for $956,000 in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Shortly after the record-breaking million-dollar sale of ''Action Comics'' #1 in 2010, a copy of ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #27 featuring the first appearance of [[Batman]] was sold for $1,075,000 in a [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/batman-beats-superman-again-as-his-first-appearance-breaks-1-million-mark/|title=Batman beats Superman (again) as his first comic appearance breaks $1-million mark|date=February 26, 2010|newspaper=Hero Complex - movies, comics, pop culture - Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors determine the value of a first appearance. Note: All values are according to [http://www.comicspriceguide.com/default.asp ComicsPriceGuide.com] and are for editions certified by the [http://www.cgccomics.com/ Certified Collectibles Group] (see below):
*The importance of the character(s) that debuted; the first appearance of [[Spider-Man]] in very fine condition is listed at $45,150; the first appearance of the less popular [[Iron Man]], in the same condition, is listed at $3,837; and the first appearances of the vast majority of characters are not valued significantly higher than other comics published the same month.
*The rarity of comic book itself; comics from the Golden Age are usually more valuable than later comic books because they are older and fewer copies survive. Spider-Man is more popular than [[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]] but Spider-Man’s 1962 first appearance is valued at $45,150 while a copy of The Spectre's 1940 debut, in fine condition, is valued at $54,000. Also, first appearances often lack value if they are relatively recent issues of high-profile, best-selling titles. Except during a 1990s [[Comic book collecting#The Speculator Bubble|collector’s bubble]], the first appearances of several [[Image Comics]] characters and newer [[X-Men]] have not been as valuable as one may expect for such popular characters because those comics were widely produced.
*Other reasons for historical importance; ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' (November 1961) #1 is not only the first appearance of the eponymous group but also represents a turning point in the history of Marvel Comics and is the first issue of a long-running series.
*Occasionally, a comic book is the first appearance of more than one important character. Usually the characters are related; ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963) introduced the X-Men and their archenemy [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmro.travis-starnes.com/detail.php?idvalue=75 Complete Marvel Reading Order]&lt;/ref&gt; However, rarely a comic book is the first appearance of two unrelated, important characters. ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #73 (November 1941) introduced both [[Green Arrow]] and [[Aquaman]], who have little relation to one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/mbrown123/morefun73.html geocities.com/mbrown123]{{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also the case with ''Action Comics'' #1, which contained the first appearances of [[Zatara]] and [[Tex Thomson]], as well as Superman.
*Occasionally a first appearance will lack the value expected for a character of such stature because the debut was not splashy. [[Wonder Woman]], an immensely popular and historically important hero, debuted in [[All Star Comics 8|''All Star Comics'' #8]] (December 1941) in one of several stories and was not featured on the cover. This issue is valued at $30,000 in fine condition. Comparatively, the first appearances of equally (or even less) important peers [[Green Lantern]] and The Flash, boldly introduced on their covers, are worth $131,250 and $69,000, respectively. Arguably, the first appearance of Wonder Woman is worth much less because she did not make a flashy debut that lent the comic book an air of history.
*As is the case with all collectibles, condition greatly affects the value of comic books, although considerable wear is expected for decades-old comics. Most comic books are worth more if their condition is certified and they are protectively packaged (or "slabbed") by the Certified Collectibles Group, a professional grading service involved in the sale of most high-value comic books, although some fans accuse the group of inflating the value of comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teako170.com/cgc.html|title=TMe: CGC: The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly|author=|date=|website=www.teako170.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambiguity of first appearance==
While seemingly a simple concept, determining the first appearance may be complex. The following are instances in which a character’s first appearance may be difficult to determine:
*Those unfamiliar to comics may assume that [[Iron Man]]’s first appearance is ''The Invincible Iron Man'' #1 (May 1968). However, in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|golden]] and early [[Silver Age of Comic Books|silver]] ages of comic books, few superheroes debuted in magazines carrying their names. More often a character first appeared in a generically titled [[anthology]] series. If the character proved popular, a new series was launched. For example, Iron Man first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39 (March 1963) and appeared regularly in that series for five years before Marvel launched a series properly named ''Iron Man''. [[Wonder Woman]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]] and many others also first appeared in anthology series.
*The first appearance of "all-star" teams is given as the first instance in which that team banded together regardless of whether or not it consists of previously existing characters. The first appearance of The [[Justice League of America]] is considered ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #28 (May 1960), the issue in which they first operated as a group, although none of its members first appeared in that issue. Alternatively, ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963) is both the first appearance of the [[X-Men]] and that of each of the team’s original members.
*Sometimes a character first appears in the last page of an issue, [[foreshadowing]] his or her greater role in the next issue. Arguments can ensue over whether the first appearance is the issue containing the final page [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] or the subsequent issue which more adequately introduced the character. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] was first seen in the last page of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #180 (October 1974) but makes a more full appearance in issue #181 (November 1974). Stricter fans may consider ''The Incredible Hulk'' #180 Wolverine’s first appearance but most consider it #181. ComicsPriceGuide.com lists a copy of issue #180, rated very fine, at $149 and #181 at $2,075. Comparatively, ''The Incredible Hulk'' #179 (September 1974), which has no special importance, is listed at $11, so both types of first appearance add value to a comic book.
*[[Retconning]] can also complicate first appearances. Initially, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] was portrayed as a wholly new character, first appearing in ''The [[New Mutants]]'' #87 (March 1990). However, writers later changed his background, stating that Cable is an adult, [[Time travel|time-travel]]ing Nathan Summers, the son of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]], first seen in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #201 (January 1986). Both issues could be given as the first appearance of Cable. Further complicating the matter, Cable was seen in a cameo at the end of ''The New Mutants'' #86 (February 1990).
*Some superhero identities are used by more than one character. The [[Alan Scott|original Green Lantern]] first appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #16 (April 1940). During the Silver Age, [[Green Lantern]], like many [[DC Comics|DC]] heroes, was [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]]ed with a totally new identity. The second Green Lantern, [[Hal Jordan]], debuted in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #22 (October 1959). ''All-American Comics'' #16 is still considered the first appearance of Green Lantern, both of the original title-bearer and the superhero identity itself. To avoid confusion, ''Showcase'' #22 is called the first appearance of Hal Jordan, of Green Lantern II or of the Silver Age Green Lantern.
*Occasionally, a character will appear in the background of a comic book before fully introduced. Spider-Man’s early love interest [[Liz Allan]] is first addressed by name in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #4 (September 1963). However, an unnamed character in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #1 (March 1963) is, based on her appearance and dialogue, probably Allan. Plus, ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (August 1962), shows an unnamed, unspeaking character who looks exactly like Allan. Thus Allan's first appearance may be given as any of the three.
*Some characters appear in more than one [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. While the first appearance of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] is ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (May 1975), the first appearance of [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Ultimate Nightcrawler|"Ultimate Nightcrawler]]" (Nightcrawler in the alternate [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe) is ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #6 (August 2001).
*Sometimes new characters are created for [[television]] or [[movie|film]] adaptations of a franchise and are later added to the comic book continuity. The [[Batman]] adversary [[Harley Quinn]] debuted in the 1992 ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Joker's Favor". Her first appearance in [[comic]] format was the [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Batman Adventures|The Batman Adventures #12]],'' which took place in the continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series.'' Her first appearance in the regular "[[DC Universe]]" was the 1999 [[one shot (comic)|one-shot]] ''Batman: Harley Quinn.'' Thus her first appearance is technically ''Joker's Favor,'' her first appearance in a comic book was ''The Batman Adventures #12'' and her first appearance in the regular DC Comics continuity was ''Batman: Harley Quinn.''  Similarly, [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] first appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' #1, which adapted the first episode of the TV series.  Her first [[Earth-616]] appearance was in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #193.
*Rarely, a character debuts in a publisher’s foreign branch and then appears in a domestic series. [[Psylocke]] first appeared in ''[[Captain Britain]]'' #8 (December 1976), an original series of [[Marvel UK]] not widely available outside [[Great Britain]]. Her debut in an [[United States|American]] series was ''The New Mutants Annual'' #2 (1986). Her first appearance is sometimes given as either but more correctly it is ''Captain Britain'' #8 while ''The New Mutants Annual'' #2 is her first US appearance.
*Some characters appear first in a normal supporting role before becoming a superhero or villain.  For example, Roderick Kingsley first appeared as a minor supporting character in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #43 (June 1980).  However, he would later take on the villainous role of the [[Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley)|Hobgoblin]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #238 (March 1983), becoming one of Spider-Man's most dangerous foes.  The latter issue, featuring his first appearance as the Hobgoblin, is worth quite a bit more than his original debut.

==First appearances of popular heroes, villains and teams==
Note: All values are according to ''Comics Price Guide.'' Prices given are for the best available editions. Thus prices of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] comics are for editions in "fine" condition because editions in better condition for such old comics are either extremely rare or have never been confirmed to exist. Prices for [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] and subsequent comics are for "very fine" editions. Priced are also for editions graded by the Certified Collectibles Group. Data is correct {{As of|2006|01|25|lc=yes|df=us}}.
&lt;!--Please keep additions limited to very important heroes, villains or teams. Also no need to note Golden or Silver Age versions; that matter is covered above --&gt;

The '''Genesis flood narrative''' is a [[flood myth]] found in the [[Tanakh]] (chapters 6–9 in the [[Book of Genesis]]).{{sfn|Leeming|2010|p=469}} The story tells of God's decision to return the [[Earth]] to its pre-creation state of watery [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] and then remake it in a reversal of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]].{{sfn|Bandstra|2009|p=61}} The narrative has very strong similarities to parts of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] which predates the Book of Genesis.

Scientists have unsuccessfully attempted to reconcile the flood narrative with physical findings in geology and palaeontology.&lt;ref name=rocks/&gt; [[Flood geology]] is considered to be [[pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name=counter/&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2018}}

The flood is part of what scholars call the [[Primeval history]], the first 11 chapters of Genesis.{{sfn|Cline|2007|p=13}} These chapters, [[fable]]-like and [[Legend|legendary]], form a preface to the [[Patriarchal age|patriarchal narratives]] which follow, but show little relationship to them.{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=13-14}}{{sfn|Cline|2007|p=13}}{{sfn|Sailhamer|2010|p=301 and fn.35}} For example, the names of its characters and its geography - [[Adam]] ("Man") and [[Eve]] ("Life"), the [[Land of Nod]] ("Wandering"), and so on - are symbolic rather than real, and much of the narratives consist of lists of "firsts" - the first murder, the first wine, the first empire-builder.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=2}} Most notably, almost none of the persons, places and stories in it are ever mentioned anywhere else in the Bible.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=2}} This has led scholars to suppose that the History forms a late composition attached to Genesis to serve as an introduction.{{sfn|Sailhamer|2010|p=301}} Just how late is a subject for debate: at one extreme are those who see it as a product of the [[Hellenistic period]], in which case it cannot be earlier than the first decades of the 4th century BCE;{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=240-241}} on the other hand the  [[Jahwist|Yahwist]] source has been dated by others, notably [[John Van Seters]], to the [[Babylonian captivity| exilic pre-Persian period]] (the 6th century BCE), precisely because the Primeval History contains so much [[Babylonia]]n influence in the form of [[myth]].{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=6}}&lt;ref group="Note" name="Seters"&gt;See John Van Seters, ''Prologue to History: The Yahwist as Historian in Genesis'' (1992), pp.80, 155-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flood narrative is made up of two stories woven together.{{sfn|Cline|2007|p=19}} As a result many details are contradictory, such as how long the flood lasted (40 days according to Genesis 7:17, 150 according to 7:24), how many animals were to be taken aboard the ark (one pair of each in 6:19, one pair of the unclean animals and seven pairs of the clean in 7:2), and whether Noah released a raven which "went to and fro until the waters were dried up" or a dove which on the third occasion "did not return to him again," or possibly both.{{sfn|Cline|2007|p=20|ps= — Which was it—40 or 150 days? ... And how many animals ... One pair of each ... 
Or seven pairs of each ... And did he release a raven ... until the waters 
were dried up ... or did he release a dove three different times ... ?}} Despite this disagreement on details the story forms a unified whole (some scholars see in it a "[[Chiastic structure|chiasm]]", a literary structure in which the first item matches the last, the second the second-last, and so on),&lt;ref group="Note" name="Chiasm"&gt;The controversial existence of a chiasm is not an argument against the construction of the story from two sources. See the overview in R.E. Friedman (1996), p.91.&lt;/ref&gt; and many efforts have been made to explain this unity, including attempts to identify which of the two sources was earlier and therefore influenced the other.{{sfn|Arnold|2009|p=97}}&lt;ref group="Note" name="Sources"&gt;The two sources are the [[Priestly source|Priestly]] and the [[Yahwist]] or "non-priestly". See Bill Arnold, "Genesis" (2009), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative mythology===
{{Main|Flood myth}}
The flood myth originated in [[Mesopotamia]].{{sfn|Chen|2013|p=1}} The Mesopotamian story has three distinct versions, the [[Sumer]]ian [[Ziusudra|Epic of Ziusudra]], and as episodes in two works in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (the language of [[Babylon]]), the [[Atra-Hasis|Atrahasis Epic]] and the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].{{sfn|Finkel|2014|p=88}} The oldest written text is the Ziusudra epic, dating from about 1600 BCE.{{sfn|Finkel|2014|p=88}}

==Genesis 6:9-9:17==
[[File:Deluge.png|thumb|175px|right|''The Deluge'' (illustration by [[Gustave Doré]] from the 1865 ''La Sainte Bible'')]]

===Summary===
[[Noah]] was a righteous man and walked with God. Seeing that the earth was corrupt and filled with violence, God instructed Noah to build an [[Noah's ark|ark]] in which he, his sons, and their wives, together with male and female of all living creatures, would be saved from the waters. Noah entered the ark in his six hundredth year, and on the 17th day of the 2nd month of that year "the fountains of the Great Deep burst apart and the floodgates of heaven broke open" and rain fell for forty days and forty nights until the highest mountains were covered 15 cubits, and all life perished except Noah and those with him in the ark. 

In Jewish legend, the kind of water that was pouring to the earth for forty days is not the common, but God bade each drop pass through [[Hell]] of [[Gehenna]] before it fell to earth, and the 'hot rain' scalded the skin of the sinners. The punishment that overtook them was befitting their crime. As their sensual desires had made them hot, and inflamed them to immoral excesses, so they were chastised by means of heated water.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews|The Legends of the Jews]] [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol1/four.htm#5 Vol I : The Inmates of the Ark]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 150 days "God remembered Noah ... and  the waters subsided" until the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat. On the 27th day of the 2nd month of Noah's six hundred and first year the earth was dry. Then Noah built an altar and made a sacrifice, and God made a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with Noah that man would be allowed to eat every living thing but not its blood, and that God would never again destroy all life by a flood.

===The flood and the creation narrative===
The flood is a reversal and renewal of God's creation of the world.{{sfn|Baden|2012|p=184}} In [[Genesis 1]] God separates the "waters above the earth" from those below so that dry land can appear as a home for living things, but in the flood story the "windows of heaven" and "fountains of the deep" are opened so that the world is returned to the watery chaos of the time before creation.{{sfn|Keiser|2013|p=133}} Even the sequence of flood events mimics that of creation, the flood first covering the earth to the highest mountains, then destroying, in order, birds, cattle, beasts, "swarming creatures", and finally mankind.{{sfn|Keiser|2013|p=133}} (This, incidentally, mirrors the Babylonian flood story in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], where at the end of rain "all of mankind had returned to clay," the substance of which they had been made).{{sfn|Keiser|2013|p=133 fn.29}}
The ark itself is likewise a microcosm of [[Solomon's Temple]].

===Intertextuality: the flood story as the reversal of creation===
"Intertextuality" means the way episodes in the biblical books refer to and echo each other. Such echoes are seldom coincidental - for example, the word used for Noah's ark is the same used for the basket in which Moses is saved, implying a link between the stories of Moses and Noah, both of them divinely chosen saviours in a world threatened by water and chaos.{{sfn|Bodner|2016|p=95-96}} The most significant such echo is with the [[Genesis creation narrative]]: the division between the "waters above" and the "waters below" the earth is removed, the flood covers the dry land, all life is destroyed, and only Noah and those with him survive to obey the divine command to "be fruitful and multiply."{{sfn|Levenson|1988|p=10-11}}

==Religious views==
===Christianity===
{{See also|Biblical literalism|Biblical inerrancy|Biblical infallibility}}
The Genesis flood narrative is included in the Old Testament of the Christian [[Bible]] (see [[Books of the Bible]]). Jesus and the apostles additionally taught on the Genesis flood narrative in New Testament writing ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt.+24%3A37-39&amp;version=NIV Matt 24:37-39], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+17%3A26-27&amp;version=NIV Luke 17:26-27], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A20&amp;version=NIV 1 Peter 3:20], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A5&amp;version=NIV 2 Peter 2:5], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A6&amp;version=NIV 2 Peter 3:6], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%3A7&amp;version=NIV Hebrews 11:7])&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.creationworldview.org/articles_view.asp?id=40.|title=Creation Worldview Ministries: The New Testament and the Genesis Flood: A Hermeneutical Investigation of the Historicity, Scope, and Theological Purpose of the Noahic Deluge|website=www.creationworldview.org|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Additionally, some scholars commenting on the teaching of the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A18-22&amp;version=NIV 1 Peter 3:18-22]), connect the ark with the resurrection of Christ; the waters burying the old world but raising Noah to a new life&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Christian scholars also highlight that [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A18-22&amp;version=NIV 1 Peter 3:18-22] demonstrates the Genesis flood as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] to Christian [[baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/947797222|title=Matthew henry's concise commentary on the whole bible : nelson's concise series.|last=Matthew.|first=Henry,|date=2000|publisher=Nelson Reference &amp; Electr|isbn=0785245294|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=947797222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/schmeling.html|title=The Typological Interpretation of the Old Testament, by G.R.

In the [[Catholic Church]], [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] belief in Noah's ark and the flood narrative is neither required, nor forbidden. However, Catholic schools almost always teach evolution in science classes.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2018}}

In Protestant churches more variability is found, and many, but by no means all, denominations teach a literalist stance. {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2018}}

===Islam===
{{main|Noah in Islam}}
The [[Quran]] states that [[Islamic view of Noah|Noah (Nūḥ)]] was inspired by [[God in Islam|God]], believed in the oneness of God, and [[Surrender (religion)|preached Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|163|s=r}}, {{cite quran|26|105|e=107|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; God commanded Noah to build an ark. As he was building it, the chieftains passed him and mocked him. Upon its completion, the ark was loaded with the animals in Noah's care as well as his immediate household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|11|35|e=41|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people who denied the message of Noah, including one of his [[Fourth son of Noah|own sons]], drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|7|64|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final resting place of the ark was referred to as [[Mount Judi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|11|44|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yazidi===
According to the [[Yazidi Black Book|Yazidi ''Mishefa Reş'']], two flood events occurred. The first flood involved Noah and his family, whose ark landed at a place called [[Ain Sifni]] in the region of [[Nineveh Plains]], {{convert|40|km}} north-east of [[Mosul]]. In the second flood, the [[Yazidi]] race was preserved in the person of [[Na'mi]] (or [[Na'umi]]), surnamed [[Malik Miran]], who became the second founder of their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, London Institution, Volume 2|year=1921|publisher=School of Oriental Studies|location=University of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ark was pierced by a rock as it floated above [[Mount Sinjar]], but settled in the same location as in Islamic tradition, [[Mount Judi]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Historicity==
While some scholars have tried to offer possible explanations for the origins of the flood myth including a legendary retelling of a possible [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis|Black Sea deluge]], the general mythological exaggeration and implausibility of the story are widely recognized by relevant academic fields. The acknowledgement of this follows closely the development of understanding of the [[natural history]] and especially the [[geology]] and [[paleontology]] of the planet.&lt;ref name=rocks&gt;{{Cite book

===Flood geology===
{{main|Flood geology|Scriptural geologist}}

The development of scientific [[geology]] had a profound impact on attitudes towards the biblical flood narrative. By bringing into question the [[biblical chronology]], which placed the Creation and the Flood in a history which stretched back no more than a few thousand years, the concept of deep geological time undermined the idea of the historicity of the ark itself. In 1823 the English theologian and natural scientist [[William Buckland]] interpreted [[geology|geological]] phenomena as ''Reliquiae Diluvianae'': "relics of the flood" which "attested the action of a universal deluge".{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} His views were supported by others at the time, including the influential geologist [[Adam Sedgwick]], but by 1830 Sedgwick considered that the evidence suggested only local floods. [[Louis Agassiz]] subsequently explained such deposits as the results of [[glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Herbert |first = Sandra |publication-date = 1991 |title = Charles Darwin as a prospective geological author |periodical = British Journal for the History of Science |issue = 24 |pages = 171–174 |url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A342&amp;pageseq=13 |accessdate = 2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 William Thompson (later to become [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]]) calculated the [[age of the Earth]] at between 24 million and 400 million years, and for the remainder of the 19th century, discussion focused not on the viability of this theory of [[deep time]], but on the derivation of a more precise figure for the age of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dalrymple|1991|pp=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lux Mundi (book)|Lux Mundi]]'', an 1889 volume of theological essays which is usually held{{By whom|date=December 2016}} to mark a stage in the acceptance of a more critical approach to scripture, took the stance that readers should rely on the [[gospel]]s as completely historical, but should not take the earlier chapters of Genesis literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By a variety of independent means, scientist have determined that the Earth is approximately [[Age of the Earth|4.54 billion years old]].

The [[scientific community]] regards flood geology as [[pseudoscience]] because it contradicts a variety of facts in geology, stratigraphy, geophysics, physics, [[paleontology]], biology, anthropology, and archeology.&lt;ref name=counter&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Montgomery|2012}} Modern geology, its sub-disciplines and other scientific disciplines utilize the [[scientific method]] to analyze the geology of the earth. Scientific analysis refutes the key tenets of flood geology, which, as an idea, is in contradiction to [[scientific consensus]].{{sfn|Young|1995}}{{sfn|Isaak|2006}}{{sfn|Morton|2001}}{{sfn|Isaak|2007|p= 173}}{{sfn|Stewart|2010|p= 123}} Modern [[geology]] relies on a number of established principles, one of the most important of which is [[Charles Lyell]]'s principle of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. In relation to geological forces, uniformitarianism holds that the shaping of the Earth has occurred by means of mostly slow-acting forces that can be seen in operation today. In general, there is a lack of any evidence for any of the above effects proposed by flood geologists, and scientists do not take their claims of fossil-layering seriously.{{sfn|Isaak|1998}}

===Species distribution===
By the 17th century believers in the Genesis account faced the issue of reconciling the exploration of the [[New World]] and increased awareness of the [[Species distribution|global distribution of species]] with the older scenario whereby all life had sprung from a single point of origin on the slopes of [[Mount Ararat]]. The obvious answer involved mankind spreading over the continents following the destruction of the [[Tower of Babel]] and taking animals along, yet some of the results seemed peculiar. In 1646 Sir [[Thomas Browne]] wondered why the natives of [[North America]] had taken [[rattlesnake]]s with them, but not [[horse]]s: "How America abounded with Beasts of prey and noxious Animals, yet contained not in that necessary Creature, a Horse, is very strange".{{sfn|Cohn|1999|p=}}

Browne, among the first to question the notion of [[spontaneous generation]], was a medical doctor and amateur scientist making this observation in passing. However, biblical scholars of the time, such as [[Justus Lipsius]] (1547–1606) and [[Athanasius Kircher]] (c.1601–80), had also begun to subject the Ark story to rigorous scrutiny as they attempted to harmonize the biblical account with the growing body of [[natural history|natural historical]] knowledge. The resulting hypotheses provided an important impetus to the study of the geographical distribution of plants and animals, and indirectly spurred the emergence of [[biogeography]] in the 18th century. Natural historians began to draw connections between climates and the animals and plants adapted to them. One influential theory held that the biblical Ararat was striped with varying climatic zones, and as climate changed, the associated animals moved as well, eventually spreading to repopulate the globe.{{sfn|Cohn|1999|p=}}

There was also the problem of an [[Species diversity|ever-expanding number of known species]]: for Kircher and earlier natural historians, there was little problem finding room for all known animal species in the ark. Less than a century later, discoveries of new species made it increasingly difficult to justify a literal interpretation for the Ark story.{{sfn|Browne|1983|p=276}} By the middle of the 18th century only a few natural historians accepted a literal interpretation of the narrative.{{sfn|Young|1995|p= [https://web.archive.org/web/20070331124027/http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p82.htm History of the Collapse of "Flood Geology" and a Young Earth]}}

==History==
In February 2014, Moscow’s [[Gogol Theatre]] reopened as the Gogol Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moscow’s Gogol Theatre reopens as Gogol Center|url=http://www.psneurope.com/moscow-s-gogol-theatre-reopens-as-gogol-center/|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a season that included   performances of [[Dead Souls]] by [[Nikolai Gogol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamlet at Gogol-center.

In May 2017, Russia’s Investigative Committee ordered police to raid the Center. The Center's Directory, Kirill Serebrennikov was detained for questioning. On 23 May, police attributed the cause of the raid and detention of its Director to an investigation of embezzlement of budget funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kirill Serebrennikov's property searched without a warrant|url=https://meduza.io/en/news/2017/05/23/kirill-serebrennikov-s-property-searched-without-a-warrant|publisher=Meduza|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was claimed that she performed a triple [[somersault]] during a routine in the US in 1896, although this has not been officially recognised.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f1sZBwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Lena+Jordan+triple+somersault&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| title= Victorian Traffic: Identity, Exchange, Performance| last=Thomas| first=Sue| publisher=[[Cambridge Scholars Publishing]]| page=184| date=May 2009| access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1897, Jordan, aged 16, became the first recorded person to perform a triple somersault during a routine in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;&lt;ref name=HB&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4145836.html| title= Lena Jordan: Set Record For Daring Trapeze Stunt| work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| via=[[Highbeam]]| date=15 December 1992| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/19/archives/trapeze-the-quest-for-the-impossible-quadruple-somersault-trapeze.html| title= Trapeze| work=[[New York Times]]| last=Culhane | first=John| date=19 March 1978| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1983/04/02/circus-lives/efae4def-4d07-4372-997f-4e9118ac9fcb/| title= Circus Lives| last=Williams| first=Christian| work=[[Washington Post]]| date=2 April 1983| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan later joined the [[Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]], during which time she performed the triple somersault 28 times.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; For many years, Ernest Clarke was wrongly attributed as performing the first recorded triple somersault. However, he first performed a triple somersault in 1909, 12 years after Jordan. In 1975, the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] acknowledged Jordan as the record holder.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

'''Michael Lau''' (born 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganaart.com/artists/artists-list/3749 Michael Lau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172203/http://www.ganaart.com/artists/artists-list/3749 |date=2015-04-02 }} at Gana Art Gallery, retrieved 26 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com.hk/around-town/features/14228/michael-lau.html Michael Lau] at Time Out Hong Kong, 20 September 2008, retrieved 26 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;) is an artist from [[Hong Kong]] who is known for his [[illustration]] and [[Designer toys|designer toy]] figures. Lau is widely credited as the founder of the urban vinyl style within the designer toy movement. His work has had a significant effect on toy manufacturers, as well as street culture, including artists and musicians, throughout &lt;nowiki&gt;the&lt;/nowiki&gt; world. His style is particularly influential to [[Asia]]n and [[United States|American]] [[hip-hop]] and [[skateboarding]] culture. Lau has won several awards for his work, including four from the Hong Kong-based Philippe Charriol Foundation.

Lau started his career by displaying his art in small galleries in Hong Kong, where Lau worked as a window display designer, before searching for employment in the [[advertising]] industry. In 1997, Lau was hired to illustrate the cover art for the [[Anodize]] [[electronic music]] album. In 1998, he began the ''Gardener'' [[comic strip]] in ''[[East Touch]]'' [[magazine]] for which he is best known for. The characters featured in this comic strip were the basis for his first series of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] [[collectible]] figures. In 1999, his work became popular enough to attract the attention of the [[Sony]] corporation, who exclusively distributed a selection of his ''Gardener'' pieces in Asia. Lau signed a contract with Sony which lasted until 2003. During this time, Lau continued to work steadily, creating illustrations and vinyl figures in a [[graffiti]]-influenced style.

He graduated from Design First Institute in Hong Kong in 1992. While some of his art was on display in Lau worked with the Hong Kong hip-hop group [[Lazy Mutha Fucka|LMF]], creating a series of figures based on them. He has created other series of urban vinyl figures, such as ''Crazychildren'' and ''Lamdog'', in addition to stand-alone pieces. His work is highly [[collectible]] and is predominantly collected by adults; his figures are almost exclusively available from designer toys retailers.

In 2004, he opened his own gallery, called michael, in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.

[[Image:Rapanookee vona.jpg|thumb|Traditional musical dance of Rapa Nui (Easter Island).]]
[[Easter Island]] is located in the [[Pacific Ocean]].  Though its earliest inhabitants, the [[Rapa Nui People]], are ethnically [[Polynesia]]n, the island is part of the [[South American]] state of [[Chile]]. The music of the island combines influences from both cultures.

==History==
Traditional music from the island consists of choral singing and chanting, similar to [[music of Tahiti|Tahitian music]].  Families often performed as choirs, competing in an annual concert.  They were accompanied by a [[trumpet]] made from a [[conch]] shell and a [[percussive]] [[dance]]r jumping onto a stone which is set over a [[calabash]] [[resonator]].  Other instruments include the [[kauaha]], the [[jaw]] bone of a horse, [[upaupa]], an [[accordion]], and stones, which are clapped together for percussive effect.

Due to ongoing contacts with Chile and elsewhere in South America, [[Latin American music]] has had influences on the music of Easter Island.  [[Tango music|Tango]], for example, has spawned an Easter Island style called [[tango Rapanui]], characterized by a simple [[guitar]] accompaniment instead of the frenetic [[bandoneon]].

The first music school on the island was opened in 2012 by [[Mahani Teave]], and teachers piano, cello, ukulele, and violin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-music-school-on-the-most-isolated-island-in-the_us_5878c02be4b077a19d180cdc|title=The Music School on the Most Isolated Island in the World|last=Edwards|first=Isabel Custer|date=13 January 2017|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisischile.cl/pianist-mahani-teave-launches-international-campaign-to-build-a-music-school-in-easter-island/?lang=en|title=Pianist Mahani Teave launches international campaign to build a music school in Easter Island|last=|first=|date=|website=This is Chile|language=en-US|access-date=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Suicide Prevention Lifeline''' (1-800-273-TALK [8255]) is a United States-based [[suicide prevention]] network of 161 crisis centers that provides a [[24/7 service|24/7]], toll-free hotline available to anyone in suicidal crisis or emotional distress. After dialling 1-800-273-TALK (8255), the caller is routed to their nearest crisis center to receive immediate counseling and local mental health referrals. The Lifeline supports people who call for themselves or someone they care about.

== History ==
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline grant is one component of the National Suicide Prevention Initiative (NSPI), a multi-project effort to reduce suicide, led by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]]’s (SAMHSA) Center for Mental Health Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/cmhs/nspi/ CMHS Programs: National Suicide Prevention Initiative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, SAMHSA released a notice of funding availability (NOFA) as part of its National Suicide Prevention Initiative (NSPI). In keeping with SAMHSA's duty to advance the goals of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, the NOFA called for proposals from nonprofit organizations to expand, enhance, and sustain a network of certified crisis centers providing suicide prevention and intervention services to those in need using a toll-free number and website.

In September 2004, the Mental Health Association of New York City (MHA-NYC) was selected to administer the federally funded network of crisis centers named the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/SVP-0141/ "Lonely? Trapped? Hopeless? Alone? When it seems like there is no hope, there is help."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline was founded by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]], a division of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]].

[[Google Search|Google]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[Yahoo]] and [[Ask.com]] all place the phone number and website details of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline as the reserved first result for when one enters keywords related to suicide, such as "How to tie a noose" and "I want to die."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How do search engines respond when you Google ‘suicide’? |url=https://www.dailydot.com/via/germanwings-suicide-hotline/ |website=DailyDot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the musician and [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] artist [[Logic (musician)|Logic]] released a song featuring [[Alessia Cara]] and [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]] for his third album ''[[Everybody (Logic album)|Everybody]]'' titled “[[1-800-273-8255 (song)|1-800-273-8255]]”, the number used for The National Suicide Prevention Hotline. On the day of the song release, the lifeline received one of its highest daily call volumes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8039094/logic-1-800-273-8255-national-suicide-prevention-lifeline-statistics-tweet|title=Logic Tweets National Suicide Prevention Lifeline Statistics Since His '1-800' Release|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made to bring awareness to the hotline and to the problems associated with suicide. After being featured on the [[2017 MTV Video Music Awards]], it increased the calls to the hotline by 50% that night. On the day of the song release, "Lifeline's Facebook page saw 3 times its usual traffic" and Lifeline's "website saw a 17% increase in users in May 2017 over the previous month."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the callers to several crisis centers have mentioned Logic's song, and a third of those callers were struggling with suicidal thoughts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== VA partnership ==
In June 2007, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) partnered with SAMHSA and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to provide a veterans hotline to help vets in emotional crisis. Veterans who indicate that they are a U.S. military veteran by pressing one after dialing 1-800-273-TALK, are routed to the Veterans Hotline. This service caters to veteran-specific mental health care needs and helps connect vets to the VA Healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/ Mental Health Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nelson Faro DeCastro''',&lt;ref name=SVA&gt;[http://www.sva.edu/faculty/nelson-faro-decastro "Our Faculty: Nelson Faro DeCastro"]. [[School of Visual Arts]]. Retrieved October 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''Nelson''' (born February 17, 1969&lt;ref name=SpiderWebArt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pantozzi, Jill (February 7, 2009). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19923 "The Nerdy Bird flies around NYCC, Day 1"]. [[Comic Book Resources]]&lt;/ref&gt;), is an American [[comic book artist]] known for his airbrushed cover art, and his interior penciling, inking and coloring work. He is also a writer and teacher. Nelson's career began in the early 1990s, doing cover work and publishing his creator-owned work for [[Dark Horse Comics]], before becoming a frequent artist for both [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]].

==Early life==
Nelson Faro DeCastro was born February 17, 1969. His earliest memory of reading comics is of a ''[[Spider-Man]]'' book featuring the Gibbon, illustrated by [[John Romita Sr.|John Romita]], whom he cites as his primary artistic influence. Other influences he names include [[Caravaggio]], [[Joe Jusko]], [[Frank Frazetta]], and [[Simon Bisley]].&lt;ref name=SpiderWebArt/&gt;

Nelson studied art at the [[School of Visual Arts]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=SpiderWebArt/&gt;

==Career==

===1990s===
Before his comic book career began, DeCastro created artwork for the band [[Mucky Pup]], with whom he was friends. He provided the interior art for their 1987 album ''Can't You Take a Joke?'', and the cover art for their 1989 album, ''[[A Boy In A Man's World]]''.

Nelson broke into the American comic book industry in 1992 doing airbrushed cover work for [[Dark Horse Comics]] series, such as ''Insider'' Vol. 2 #6 and the four-issue miniseries ''[[RoboCop]]: Prime Suspect''. In 1993 he wrote and illustrated his own creator-owned [[Horror fiction|horror]] character, Eudaemon, in the [[anthology]] ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'' #72-74, for which he provided the first issue's cover. He would later publish through Dark Horse a three-issue ''Eudaemon'' series, which he wrote, pencilled, and inked, and for which he provided airbrush-painted covers.

His first comic work for the Big Two publishers was a 6-page comic book story he penciled and inked for [[Marvel Comics]]'s Custom Comic division. He would also provide the publisher with a painted cover for [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' #18 in 1993.&lt;ref name=SpiderWebArt/&gt; His first work for [[DC Comics]] doing interior illustration for ''Team [[Superman]] Secret Files and Origins'' #1, which was published in 1998. Other DC work during the 1990s includes ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]: The Ravens'' #1.

In 1999, Nelson worked for Marvel Comics, beginning with a painted cover and the interior art for ''X-Men: The [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] War'' #1. His other Marvel work that year included issues of ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'', ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' and ''[[X-Force]]''.

===2000s===
[[File:5.22.11NelsonDeCastroByLuigiNovi2.jpg|thumb|left|DeCastro drawing at the [[Big Apple Convention]], May 22, 2011]]
Nelson continued to work for Marvel Comics in the early 2000s, on such titles as ''[[Iron Man]]'', ''[[Ant-Man]]'s Big Christmas'', ''Generation X'', ''[[Marvel Knights]]'', ''[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]'', and ''[[Inhumans]]''.

He also provided work for [[DC Comics]], on ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' and 2004's ''The DC Comics Encyclopedia''. His other mid-2000s work for DC included doing inks for ''Superman: The Journey'' and inking over [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s pencils and providing his first interior color work on ''[[Action Comics]]'' #831.

Nelson branched out into educational comics with 2005's ''The Home Depot: Safety Heroes'', a giveaway from the [[Home Depot]] featuring several Marvel Comics characters, as well as into Marvel's mature readers imprint, [[MAX (comics)|MAX]], with ''Doctor Spectrum'', two issues of which he inked, and Marvel's [[Marvel Ultimate|Ultimate]] line, providing interior inks for three issues of the miniseries ''[[Ultimate Nightmare]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Galactus Trilogy]]''.

Although he mostly worked for Marvel Comics in the late 2000s, in 2008 Nelson provided the interior pencils and inks for DC's ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]'' #21-22.

2009 marked Nelson's first foray into writing for The Big Two publishers, with the story "The Strange Bonds of Strange People", which appeared in ''Astonishing Tales: [[The Thing (comics)|The Thing]]'' #1 by Marvel Digital Comics. He also provided inks for ''[[War of Kings]]: Savage World of [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]]'', for which he was credited on the cover as "DeCastro", and not "Nelson", as he is typically credited. That year he also inked issues of  ''[[Incredible Hercules]]'', and penciled and inked ''Iron Man: Iron Protocols''.

===Other work===
As of 2010, Nelson teaches a Drawing for Cartoonists course at [[Manhattan]]'s [[School of Visual Arts]], where he himself once studied.&lt;ref name=SVA/&gt;

DeCastro has illustrated cards for the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' collectible card game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiderwebart.com/products.asp?artist=Nelson+DeCastro "Paintings - Acrylic (39)  "]. SpiderWebArt. Retrieved October 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
DeCastro is an avid [[guitar]] player, and expressed a desire to try [[sculpture]], though he laments that he has trouble finding the time.&lt;ref name=SpiderWebArt/&gt;

The '''Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame''', located in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], is a [[non-profit organization]] that honors [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[gospel music|gospel]] musicians in the state of [[Oklahoma]]. Housed in the former [[Union Depot (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Tulsa Union Depot]], which it now calls the Jazz Depot, the Hall of Fame is a [[music venue]] that hosts regular jazz performances. It is also a museum, displaying photographs, biographical information, artifacts, and memorabilia from musicians such as [[Chet Baker]], [[Earl Bostic]], [[Barney Kessel]], and [[Jimmy Rushing]].&lt;ref&gt;Danilov, Victor J. ‘’Hall of Fame Museums: A Reference Guide.’’ Greenwood, 1997, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame holds an annual induction ceremony to recognize the meaningful contributions of individuals and groups in jazz, blues, and gospel music. The Hall of Fame originally inducted its members every June,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Hannibal B. ‘’Black Wall Street: From Riot to Renaissance in Tulsa’s Historic Greenwood District.’’ Marion Koogler McNay Art Museum, 1998, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; but the annual induction is now held in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BRANDY MCDONNELL |url=http://newsok.com/david-amram-will-receive-oklahoma-jazz-hall-of-fames-lifetime-achievement-award/article/3623496#ixzz1dprITL14 |title=David Amram will receive Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame's Lifetime Achievement Award |publisher=News OK |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the Hall of Fame has inducted more than 100 musicians and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.okjazz.org/index.cfm?id=5 |title=Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame |website=Okjazz.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music instructor [[Zelia N.

The Hall of Fame also established the [[Jay McShann]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999 to honor musicians who enriched Oklahoma's music during their lifetimes. Recipients of this award include Jay McShann, John Hendricks, Lou Donaldson, Dave Brubeck, Marilyn Maye, Ramsey Lewis, Nat King Cole, George Duke, Billy Taylor, Eddie Palmieri, Bob Wills, and Lalo Schifrin.

In 1991, guitarist [[Barney Kessel]] made a speech about improvised music at the Hall of Fame; this was his last recorded public appearance before a stroke forced him to retire in May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Yanow, Scott. ‘’Jazz On Film: The Complete Story of the Musicians and Music Onscreen.’’ Backbeat, 2004, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Joe Lee Wilson]] also made his [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUhJPXyhZ2s last public performance] at his 2010 induction into the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/ourlives/article.aspx?subjectid=58&amp;articleid=20110720_11_A11_CUTLIN895827&amp;rss_lnk=58 |title=Obituaries |publisher=Tulsa World |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:1970 12 28 Tulsa Union Depot 5.jpg|left|thumb|The Tulsa Union Depot remained empty for nearly twenty years before being renovated and re-purposed for public use.]]
The Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame was recognized by the [[Oklahoma Legislature]] in 1988, with legislation authored by State Senators [[Maxine Horner]] and Penny Williams. The Hall of Fame was one of several organizations created in the North Tulsa “renaissance” dedicated to reconstructing the city’s historic [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood district]] after the [[Tulsa Race Riot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=6050 |title=H-Net Reviews |website=H-net.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was originally housed in the Greenwood Cultural Center, and co-sponsored a yearly celebration of Oklahoman black music tradition called “Juneteenth on Greenwood.”&lt;ref&gt;State Arts Council of Oklahoma. ‘’Juneteenth on Greenwood: A Celebration of Oklahoma’s Black Music Traditions.’’ State Arts Council of Oklahoma, 1989, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Tulsa County, Oklahoma|Tulsa County]]’s [[Vision 2025]] project allocated $4 million to purchase and renovate the [[Union Depot (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Tulsa Union Depot]] for use by the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vision2025.info/project.php?project%3Doklahomajazzhalloffame%26category%3Doklahomajazzhalloffame |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503213322/http://vision2025.info/project.php?project=oklahomajazzhalloffame&amp;category=oklahomajazzhalloffame |archivedate=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the building was completed and the building officially opened on June 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vision2025.info/category.php?category%3Doklahomajazzhalloffame |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315195315/http://www.vision2025.info/category.php?category=oklahomajazzhalloffame |archivedate=March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Outlive''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] developed and produced by [[Continuum Entertainment]]. It is a mission-based real-time strategy game where the player controls either the human military or robot forces and attempts to eliminate all opposing forces. It was initially released in {{vgy|2000}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamesbrasil.uol.com.br/reviews.php?nick=outlive http://gamesbrasil.uol.com.br]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Brazil]] (2001 for the rest of the world), and was the second and most successful product of Continuum. The game was one of the few Brazilian games to be published by a mainstream AAA publisher. It was published in the United States and Europe by [[Take-Two Interactive]].

==Plot summary==

===Human Campaign===
The increase of terrorist activity around the globe (the terrorist organizations had merged, creating large conglomerates whom the strongest and most feared was the Liberty Army) and the rapidly dwindling natural resources of the planet had forced the world's most powerful nations to take decisive measures. April 17, 2035 saw the creation of the World Council. The Council saw humanity's survival in interplanetary supply of resources mined on other celestial bodies. They sent out a large group of probes to nearly every planet and moon of the Solar System. After a lengthy search, they had found that the richest object is Titan. The Council started the Outlive Project: constructing three starships which would carry the initial colonists there. However, there was a problem: Titan's atmosphere was toxic to humans, and the climate was not so friendly either.

Two groups had arisen to solve the problem. One of them, led by Dr. Joseph Taylor, had tried to create genetically modified creatures to do the initial work. The other group, led by Dr. Mary-Anne Harley and sponsored by Mechatronics Inc., would combine robotics with sophisticated AI, making them suitable to do anything without the need for human supervision. Due to the shortage of time, the World Council gave both teams one Earth year to create working prototypes of the respective projects.

As the Outlive project neared completion, Dr. Taylor was ordered to relocate to a new research base after an unsuccessful attempt on his life. Prior to the transfer, all staff and equipment was stored in a military outpost. As LA forces held the sector, the newly created Special Counter-Terrorist Group and its leader, Brad Maxwell, had to clear a safe way for the convoy to the lab. Maxwell was a little angry at Taylor, as the impatient scientist had gone to the lab already when he reached the outpost. However, shortly after their arrival, a breakout of the unstable beings known as Abominables occurred. They had destroyed the base, scattering the staff. Taylor had been found and evacuated. Because of the accident, the World Council had terminated Taylor's contract, much to his protest, declaring that the three Outlive ships will have a robotic crew. However, the Liberty Army had occupied Mechatronics.

Maxwell had cleared them out, using some of the Mechatronics' head, Carl Eberhardt's prototype battle robots. Even though the LA has been pushed out, Maxwell became suspicious of Mechatronics' motives, as materials used for weapons had been found in the facility. One of his subordinates, Lieutenant Peter Mackenzie, accompanied him to the Experimental City, where they believed Mechatronics trained their robots as soldiers. Although General Kaminski told them to don't care with this subject, they found hard proof in the Technology Center. Kaminski promised them a complete investigation after the Outlive mission was away.

The three ships were finally completed, but the launch was halted by news of two AA-artilleries recently installed by Pablo Morales, leader of the Liberty Army, very close to the launching sites. As both of them had been destroyed by Maxwell, the mission was finally launched. However, there were a third artillery, hidden in an underground base. SCTG forces quickly destroyed it, but the damage has been done: the rocket hit ''Outlive-1''. Upon reentry, the ship broke into 3 larger pieces. ''Outlive-2'' had reported of a contact with something then connection was lost. ''Outlive-3'' reported they had safely landed on Titan and started mining operations as per orders.

The World Council received reports that Liberty Army forces were on their way to the crash site. As Maxwell and Mackenzie arrived in the sector, Kaminski told them that he was allied with Mechatronics, and ordered all of their units to execute them. But he had been interrupted by Mackenzie who told Maxwell that he is an operative to the Liberty Army; Morales had known of the World Council's corruption and their affiliation with Mechatronics; that was the reason why he attacked the corporation's facility and tried to prevent the launch. Infuriated, Maxwell willingly joined the Army to make Kaminski pay for his betrayal. Both were rescued by Morales, who told them that the robots from the downed ship had started to establish a base and mine, as if they were really on Titan. To prevent the Council from utilizing them, the three destroyed the camp and their commander, Procyon.

Utilizing information acquired by an agent, they have discovered that the Council had built ICBMs, missiles packed with nuclear warheads of a large yield. They plan to use it against the Liberty Army's encampments around the world. Mackenzie successfully disarmed all silos, however the last were booby-trapped: when Mackenzie went inside to work on that, the multi-megaton warhead exploded.
After a long-lasting and bloody battle, the Liberty Army bested both the most elite forces of the World Council and the well-armed support troops of the Mechatronics. The Council had collapsed, and the Army had formed the Confederation.

===Robot Campaign===
When the ''Outlive-2'' got out of contact, they had been secretly recalled to Earth to help the World Council against the Liberty Army. However, the war was already over when they had landed. Commander of the ship, Argus, had set "his" first objective of contacting Eberhardt. When "he" reached the base, it was in bad condition because of a surprise attack. Eberhardt fled, but was found. After destroying the nearby Confederate outpost, Eberhardt revealed his plans to Argus: "he" would have to construct and protect a portal to Titan, from which additional help in the form of Draco, leader of ''Outlive-3'' and his minions will emerge. With this newfound help, they had recaptured Mechatronics.

Some time after this, Eberhardt has been contacted by Kaminski. The Russian offered info for a meeting. As Eberhardt didn't trust him, Argus was sent. His instincts were right, as it was a trap. Kaminski said that Maxwell had granted him protection if he manages to capture a commander. Draco was enraged, and leveled the base, but Argus was already shipped to another. "He" was rescued this time, with Kaminski personally killed by Draco.

Draco received intelligence of a secret base in a valley, where Dr. Harley is experimenting with robots. When the base was destroyed, the two commanders went through the valley in search for more enemies. They had been surprised by a large amount of troops and Dr. Harley, who congratulated Argus for a good job. It turns out that she altered Argus' programming so that he would obey and sell Draco out. The latter obviously did not want to go through this and had gone berserk. However, the troops gained the upper hand and left him for dead. "He" was rescued by Eberhardt.

The two had learned about Harley's experiments and that she needed a cache of microprocessors to power up her own robots. They had prevented the cargo from reaching the destination, and even destroyed the Confederate forces in a large-scale attack.

===Cooperation campaign===
Mechatronics had taken control of the planet and the last remnants of the Confederacy is being hunted by robotic execution squads. Maxwell has been captured, Morales and Argus are on the run. The remaining forces of the Liberty Army and the Robots loyal to the Confederacy had formed the Resistance. Argus and Pablo had formed a base of both humans and Robots which had been attacked by two different Robotic bases, from both the North (Blue base) &amp; from the South (Cyan base). Then the Campaign has a twist, if you destroy the Blue base, Argus and Pablo go to rescue Maxwell which is protected by a Robotic Stronghold and a strong Robotic army which was led by a Robotic Commander named Sentinel. But if you destroy the Cyan base, Argus &amp; Pablo alone go to save Dr. Marry Anne Harley which was attacked by Robots.
When Argus &amp; Pablo go to save Maxwell, they first have to destroy Sentinel for ''he'' was the only Al in the army &amp; if ''he'' was destroyed, the Robotic Army would shut down. When Sentinel was destroyed, Argus &amp; Pablo had destroyed the Robotic Stronghold &amp; rescued Maxwell. The Resistance had also taken the remaining Robots and reprogrammed them to serve the Resistance.
When Argus &amp; Pablo alone went to rescue Dr. Mary Anne Harley, they had to destroy the AA-Artillery, which wasn't easy for they had to sneak pass the Robots which were well armed and had set up a large base. When Argus &amp; Pablo destroyed the AA-Artillery, the Resistance Air-Force could come and destroy the Robots, thus rescuing Dr. Mary Anne.
After these 2 missions, Argus and Pablo gather the Men and Robots of the Resistance and destroy the Mechatronics base in a large scale battle. The Resistance won, thus bringing the end to the harsh rule of Mechatronics. Carl had escaped, but the New Confederation had been formed, with Brad Maxwell as its leader, and an era of peace had begun.
Little did they know, that Carl had escaped from Earth and hidden himself in a space station, somewhere not far from Earth. It was at that moment that it was discovered that Carl Eberheart was working for an alien race that wishes to bring Earth to ruin. Carl was executed by the Alien Leader for his failure. Then a massive fleet of Alien UFOs appear, heading towards Earth.

==Plot==
Puli ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]) is the adopted son of a tribal village chief Vembunathan ([[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]]). From a young age, he notices the atrocities regularly committed on the villagers by a group of people from the neighbouring kingdom of Vedhalapuram called the Vedhalams, who have supernatural powers. When he becomes an adult, he starts to protect the villagers from the Vedhalams, because of which he is well respected by the villagers.

Marudheeran falls in love with his [[childhood sweetheart]] Pavazhamalli ([[Shruti Haasan]]) and both soon secretly get married and reveal it to Vembunathan who blesses them. One day, Pavazhamalli is kidnapped by a group of Vedhalams, who then ransack the village and also kill Vembunathan. Marudheeran, along with his close friends Kodangi ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]) and Sama ([[Sathyan Sivakumar|Sathyan]]), begin a journey to Vedhalapuram to rescue Pavazhamalli. During the journey, Marudheeran rescues Manthagini ([[Hansika Motwani]]), the princess of Vedhalapuram, from a [[black panther|panther]]. This is noticed by Jalatharangan ([[Kiccha Sudeep|Sudeep]]), the Commander-in-Chief of Vedhalapuram. On the pretext of being medicine makers, Marudheeran, Kodangi and Sama enter the Vedhalapuram palace, where they meet Yavanarani ([[Sridevi]]), the cruel Queen of Vedhalapuram who is also a sorceress. She allows them to stay at the palace and soon Marudheeran wins the support of the Queen and the love of Manthagini with his fighting prowess and resilience. Yavanarani announces the engagement of Marudheeran with Manthagini.

Later, Marudheeran finds out that he himself is a Vedhalam. Marudheeran was the son of Pulivendhan (Vijay), the late prince of Vedhalapuram and Yavanarani's younger brother. When he stood up to Jalatharangan, who used to terrorise the citizens of Vedhalapuram with the help of his henchmen, Jalatharangan killed him and his wife Pushpa ([[Nandita Swetha|Nanditha]]). Marudheeran also finds out that Yavanarani is actually a puppet Queen under the influence of evil magical power emanating from Jalatharangan's ring. Due to the evil magical influence, Yavanarani developed magical powers as well as her tyrannical behaviour. She performs yearly Kanya Puja to boost her magical powers. After Yavanarani performs the Kanya Puja for the eighteenth consecutive year (this time on Pavazhamalli), Jalatharangan has planned to eliminate her and take over the throne.

Marudheeran fights Jalatharangan and kills him, avenging his father's death. But before he dies, Jalatharangan opens his ring, releasing all the evil magical power so that Yavanarani could continue to rule Vedhalapuram as a tyrantess without his control after his death. Marudheeran realises that the Queen can be returned to normal only if her staff, which is the source of her magical power, is destroyed. He and Manthagini find her performing the Kanya Puja on Pavazhamalli. After a bitter sword fight with the Queen, he manages to destroy the staff, thus restoring the Queen to her normal self. In gratitude for releasing her from the evil magical influence, Yavanarani makes Marudheeran heir to the throne of Vedhalapuram.

Muthuraj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sify.com/movies/vijay-58-to-start-from-nov-10-news-tamil-olgqCvgcgeajd.html Vijay 58 to start from Nov 10]. Sify.com (6 November 2014).

* Entertainment news website Behindwoods praised the production design and visual effects of the film but criticised the screenplay, rating the film 2.75/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies/puli/puli-review.html |title=PULI MOVIE REVIEW |publisher=Behindwoods |date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* ''[[The Times of India]]'' rated the film 2.5/5, stating "Puli (Tiger) is your Indian cinema version of Gulliver and the Lilliput's fairy tale. A lavishly mounted fantasy adventure, at the core it is basically a love-story."&lt;ref&gt;Iyer, Meena (1 October 2015) [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/Puli/movie-review/49185496.cms Puli Movie Review].

*Latha Srinivasan of [[Daily News and Analysis]] gave the film 2.5/5 stars, deeming the film a "visual treat" with a disappointing screenplay. She praised the cinematography, visual effects and performances of the cast, but criticised the story, noting that the genre might be new for Tamil cinema, but "the story is not something new and it moves at such a slow pace that it gets tiring to watch in places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/review-puli-movie-review-vijay-s-film-is-a-visual-treat-but-the-screenplay-is-disappointing-2130670 |title='Puli' movie review: Vijay’s film is a visual treat, but the screenplay is disappointing |author=Srinivasan, Latha |publisher=Daily News and Analysis |date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*[[Koimoi.com]] rated the film 2/5, stating "If you are a die-hard Vijay fan then you may but if you are looking for something unique, the film will fail you.

*[[Mid Day]] rated the film 1.5/5, writing "Not fair to compare, maybe, but one cannot help it. 'Puli', at best, looks like the poor, underfed cousin of 'Bahubali', the other fantasy film that we were treated to not so long ago. The setting is almost the same.

* Both [[Baradwaj Rangan]] of ''[[The Hindu]]'' and S Saraswathi of [[Rediff.com]] gave negative reviews. Both critics also stated that several dialogues of Vijay were meant as declarations of political intent. Rangan wrote, "Put differently, Chimbu Deven has forgotten to make a movie for adults." Comparing ''Puli'' with ''[[Baahubali: The Beginning|Baahubali]]'', another [[historical fiction]] film, he said that there was "a sustained commitment to storytelling" in the latter, which was missing in ''Puli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/puli-review-a-colourful-diversion-for-undemanding-kids/article7712586.ece |title=Puli: A colourful diversion for undemanding kids |work=The Hindu |author=Baradwaj Rangan |date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* IBNLive rated the film 1/5, writing "If adventure is your genre, and Sridevi your fantasy, I’ll wholeheartedly recommend K. Raghavendra Rao’s ‘Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari’ in which Sridevi is joined by Chiranjeevi on a whirlwind tour of fantasy, games, childish humor, action, and terrific music by Ilaiyaraaja.

'''Radio Voice of the Gospel''' ('''RVOG''') was a [[Lutheran World Federation]] international [[radio station]] based in the [[Ethiopia]]n capital [[Addis Ababa]], starting in 1963.

== History ==
Radio Voice of the Gospel was the brainchild of [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[missionary]] Dr. Sigurd Aske. It had two '100&amp;nbsp;kW [[shortwave]] transmitters, which could reach much of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. It also had a [[medium wave]] transmitter serving [[Addis Ababa]]. It broadcast in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and a number of African and Asian languages.

== Programming ==
Many of Radio Voice of the Gospel programs were compiled in nine regional studios in the countries to which they were broadcast in 19 different languages. It aimed to be more general than many church-owned stations, as it broadcast news largely based on [[Reuters]], as well as drama and other features. The staff were international and [[ecumenical]]. The news staff was highly respected for the accuracy of their news reporting.

== Tensions and controversy ==
[[Ethiopia]] was still under the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], and [[political activism]] and [[free speech]] were very limited in the country. It was therefore subject to some [[censorship]] and limitations, particularly on the local [[Amharic]] service. Censorship increased after the overthrow of Haile Selassie in 1974, when the Marxist government suppressed broadcasts that they considered counterrevolutionary.

Additionally, some of the donors came from the [[fundamentalist]] wing of the church and were clearly anxious their approach should dominate, particularly in such matters as [[creation myth|creationism]].

The [[Dergue]] took control of the country in 1974. The Provisional Military Governing Council of Ethiopia took over the radio station on March 12, 1977, apparently without compensation, and renamed it [[Radio Voice of Revolutionary Ethiopia]] to propagate Marxist ideas. It broadcast in Amharic, English, [[Arabic]], and French.

'''Rousette skating''' is a [[ice skating|skating]] event, usually organized by schools, student organizations, or sports clubs. It has been traditionally held on [[Valentine's Day]]. Every skater participating in the event is assigned a numbered [[Rosette (decoration)|rosette]] (a rose-shaped ribbon or bow), blue for males and rose or pink for females. The skater's task is to skate around the rink until the person of the opposite sex wearing the same number is found. Prizes are awarded to those who find their "mystery partners". The event, which includes food and music, serves as a venue for meeting people of the opposite sex.

In [[fiction]], a '''subplot''' is a secondary strand of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]  that is a supporting side story for any story or the main plot. Subplots may connect to main plots, in either time and place or in thematic significance. Subplots often involve supporting characters, those besides the [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]]. Subplots may also intertwine with the main plot at some point in a story.

Subplots are distinguished from the main plot by taking up less of the action, having fewer significant events occur, with less impact on the "world" of the work, and occurring to less important characters.  

In [[screenwriting]], a subplot is referred to as a "B story" or a "C story," etc.

'''Tele Rebelde''' is [[Cuba]]'s second national television network, founded in 1968.

==History==
Tele Rebelde signed on July 22, 1968, in the city of [[Santiago de Cuba]]. It broadcast its signal to the [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] province and aimed to reflect the region in which it was based. It broadcast a wide variety of programs for six hours a day from Monday through Saturday and on Sunday afternoons. In 1975, it became the first station to switch to NTSC color, followed by Channel 2 in Havana.

In 1979, Tele Rebelde from Santiago de Cuba and channel 2 in Havana were merged into a unified brand, the new network retained most of the programming and the name of the Santiago de Cuba station while also opening a new studio facility.

==Programming==
The channel's programming is primarily sports, with the exception of the evening magazine, which is also transmitted by Cubavisión International, with the inclusion of domestic and foreign programs distributed by thematic blocks depending on the schedule.  From Monday to Saturday, the channel begins with the news magazine Good morning, awakening all Cuba, and reports of world and national events, emphasizing culture and sport, with the rest of the morning programming block dedicated to sports and fitness. Aside from its local and international coverage of different sports such as football, cycling, motor sports among others in which the country takes part, its flagship sports coverages are on baseball, primary on the [[Cuban baseball league system]] and is the official television partner of the [[Cuba national baseball team]]. One of its high rating broadcasts are those of the [[Cuban National Series]] season matches, from the opening day leading up to the playoffs and the national finals, as well as of the mid-year Super Series, and since 2014 is also the national broadcaster of the [[Caribbean Series]].

The channel also broadcasts cultural programming, including those in the performing arts and Cuban cinema.

==Sports coverage==
These sporting events are broadcast by Tele Rebelde and are produced by the ICRT for the channel.

[[File:Trinchera Norte en la final 2009 2.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a crowd waving banners and lighting pyrotechnics|Peruvian football club Universitario's ''barra brava'' invented the ''Vamos'' chant]]
'''''Vamos''''' (Let's go!), also known as '''''Esta Tarde''''' (This Afternoon) or '''''Esta Noche''''' (Tonight),&lt;ref name="musica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.musica.com/letras.asp?letra=1733905|title=Letra ESTA TARDE de Trinchera Norte|website=musica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a popular Spanish-language [[football chant]] from [[Peru]] attributed to the ''Trinchera Norte'' (Northern Trench), the ''[[barra brava]]'' of [[Lima]] sports club [[Club Universitario de Deportes|Universitario de Deportes]].&lt;ref name="latercera.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.latercera.com/noticia/la-historia-tras-la-arenga-chilenos/|title=La historia tras el grito "Vamos chilenos"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fanchants.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fanchants.com/es/football-songs/peru-chants/ooh-vamos-peruanos/|title='Ooh Vamos Peruanos' - Perú FanChants|website=FanChants}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Trinchera Norte'' invented the chant in the early 1990s to cheer Universitario; it has since been slightly modified by supporters of other football clubs, such as [[D.C. United]] and [[Club Universidad de Chile]], as well as by the fans of the national teams from [[Chile national football team|Chile]], [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], and [[Peru national football team|Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=May 24, 20173:41PM EDTPhil West ContributorFollow@ philwest |url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/05/24/mls-supporter-chants-evolving-global-soccer-culture-exchange |title=MLS supporter chants: An evolving global soccer-culture exchange |publisher=MLSsoccer.com |date=2017-05-24 |accessdate=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latercera.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/deportes-44618844|title=¡Arriba Perú, adiós Rusia 2018!

The chant's melody is similar to the Portuguese-language cheer ''[[List of Brazilian football songs|Eu Sou Brasileiro]]'' (I Am Brazilian), invented in 1949 by the Brazilian teacher Nelson Biasoli.&lt;ref name="republica.com.uy"/&gt;

==History==
===Universitario's ''barra brava''===
Peruvian club [[Club Universitario de Deportes|Universitario]]'s organized football supporters, ''Trinchera Norte'', created the ''Vamos'' chant in the early 1990s, originally naming the cheer as ''Esta Tarde''.&lt;ref name="musica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="latercera.com"/&gt; The chant has also been adapted by supporters of [[Peru national football team|Peru's national team]] as ''¡Vamos peruanos!'' (Let's go Peruvians!). During the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualification process]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|Russia 2018 World Cup]], Peruvians notably sung the chant alongside Argentines disgruntled by the performance of [[Argentina national football team|Argentina's national team]] at the ''[[La Bombonera]]'' stadium.&lt;ref&gt;http://rpp.pe/futbol/seleccion-peruana/video-vamos-peruanos-el-cantico-que-resono-en-la-bombonera-noticia-1080990&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vamos chilenos===
[[File:Don Francisco, 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=Photograph of a man|Don Francisco helped popularize ''Vamos'' in 1996]]
After listening to Universitario's fans singing the chant, the [[Chile]]an group ''[[Los de Abajo]]'' (The Ones From Below), the ''barra brava'' of [[Club Universidad de Chile]], adapted the chant to cheer their football club. "John Connor," the pseudonym of a leader of ''Los de Abajo'', stated to a reporter of the [[Santiago]] newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' that: "At the 'U' we began singing [the chant] in 1993, as it seemed to us to be a good tune. And thanks to us, not the Peruvians, it was popularized, because even then ''Los de Abajo'' were the biggest ''barra'' in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]."&lt;ref name="latercera.com"/&gt;

''Vamos''' popularity increased in Chile after ''Los de Abajo'' adapted the chant's lyrics to cheer [[Chile national football team|Chile's national team]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualification process]] for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|France 1998 World Cup]], renaming the chant as ''¡Vamos chilenos!'' (Let's go Chileans!).&lt;ref name="latercera.com"/&gt; During the [[1996 Chilean telethon]] for children with [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], held at that country's [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos|National Stadium]], the ''Vamos'' chant reached even higher levels of popularity after host [[Don Francisco (television host)|Don Francisco]], aided by sports journalist Jorge Hevia, slightly changed the lyrics to encourage the fundraiser's completion—ever since then, ''Vamos'' is considered the unofficial anthem of Chile's [[Teletón (Chile)|Teletón]].&lt;ref name="latercera.com"/&gt;

In 2010, Keyvan Heydari, journalist for the [[United States|American]] nonprofit [[NPR|National Public Radio]], listed ''¡Vamos chilenos!'' as representative of Chile's supporters and one of the "battle hymns" of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|South Africa 2010 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/showmeyourcleats/2010/07/06/128335191/world-cup-chants-cheer-them-on-in-their-language&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, Chilean musician Rodrigo Medel registered a version of the chant with the ''Sociedad Chilena del Derecho de Autor'' (Chilean Copyright Society), but its inscription as a [[folk music|folk song]] prevents him from receiving [[royalties]].&lt;ref name="latercera.com"/&gt;

===MLS fan anthems===

Fans from football clubs from the North American [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) have included the ''Vamos'' chant among others that they adapted from foreign leagues. Sports journalist Phil West, wrote for the MLS's official website that the [[Vancouver Southsiders]], supporters of the [[Canada|Canadian]] football club [[Vancouver Whitecaps]], adapted the ''Vamos'' chant from Chile's ''¡Vamos chilenos!''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/05/24/mls-supporter-chants-evolving-global-soccer-culture-exchange&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Screaming Eagles (MLS supporters association)|Screaming Eagles]] and [[La Barra Brava]], supporters of the American football club [[D.C. United]], also modified the chant for their club, renaming it as ''Vamos DC United''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2014/12/11/dc-united-stadium-jason-levien-mls-washington&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/03/five-best-mls-fanthems-supporter-songs&lt;/ref&gt; The altered chant, sung in Spanish, is considered traditional by the club, which even inscribed the phrase "''Vamos United Esta Noche Tenemos Que Ganar''" (Let's Go United Tonight We've Got To Win) on their 2015 jersey's neck tape.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2015/02/08/dc-united-unveil-new-secondary-jersey-2015-mls-season-nod-supporters-chant&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Elliott Turner, football correspondent for British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', listed ''Vamos DC United'' among the five best "fanthems" from MLS, describing it as "simple yet powerful."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/03/five-best-mls-fanthems-supporter-songs&lt;/ref&gt;

===International football===

''Vamos'' has increased in popularity at international football matches beyond Peru and Chile. Since 2014, the supporters of [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador's national team]] chant a version of ''Vamos'' renamed as ''¡Vamos ecuatorianos!''.&lt;ref name="republica.com.uy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elcomercio.com/deportes/hinchas-ecuatorianos-mundialbarsil2014-brasilia-ecuador.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, the ''Ultras Malaya'' supporters of [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia's national team]] chant a version of ''Vamos'' under the name of ''Ayuh MalaysiaKu'' (Come on my Malaysia!).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.24horas.cl/deportes/futbol-internacional/tradicional-y-popular-canto-chileno-es-copiado-por-la-hinchada-de-malasia-1538554&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4333">The '''Zork books''' were a series of four books, written by [[Steve Meretzky|S. Eric Meretzky]], which took place in the [[fictional universe]] of ''[[Zork]]''. The books were published by [[Tor Books]].  Like the ''Zork'' [[video game]]s, the books were a form of [[interactive fiction]] which offered the reader a choice of actions symbolized by pages to turn to, as in the contemporary book series ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'', or the later ''[[Give Yourself Goosebumps]]'' series. The protagonists of each book were a boy and girl, called Bill and June on Earth, and re-dubbed Bivotar and Juranda in Zork. The settings and plots were reminiscent of locations and events from the ''Zork'' universe.

At each ending the player received a score from zero to ten based on how far they had made it through the book and if the ending was a failure, a chance to try again at the choice where they decided incorrectly. The books also usually contained a "cheater trap", reached by opting to use an item which does not exist (at least not in the current book). The story abruptly ends; the reader is chastised and not given a chance to try again in the endings resulting from these.

The books were written in English and translated into Spanish. All four books were published as "What-Do-I-Do-Now Books". Copies did contain publication errors&amp;mdash;page numbers that the reader was directed to turn to or turn back to were at times incorrect. The first three books were published as a trilogy in August and September 1983&amp;mdash;each has the titles of the other two listed opposite the cover page. The fourth book in the series was published in October 1984.

==''The Forces of Krill''==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ztfok.jpg|thumb|right|75px|The cover of ''The Forces of Krill'', illustrated by Paul Van Munching]] --&gt;
The first book in the ''[[Zork]]'' series, ''The Forces of Krill'' utilized familiar ''Zork'' locations and scoring systems. 
Bivotar and Juranda are on a quest to find the three Palantirs of Zork and to defeat the evil sorcerer Krill.  There were 20 possible endings.

==''The Malifestro Quest''==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ztmq.jpg|thumb|left|75px|The cover of ''The Malifestro Quest'', illustrated by Dell Harris]] --&gt;
The second book in the ''Zork'' series, "The Malifestro Quest" contained several inside jokes for those familiar with the ''Zork'' games.
Bivotar and Juranda must rescue the hero Syovar from the evil wizard Malifestro along with Fred and Max, two quirky elves.  There were 18 possible endings.

==''The Cavern of Doom''==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ztcod.jpg|thumb|right|75px|The cover of ''The Cavern of Doom'', illustrated by Dell Harris]] --&gt;
The third book in the ''Zork'' series, "The Cavern of Doom" tried to capture the "exploring the dungeon" motif of the earlier games.
Bivotar and Juranda search the Cavern of Doom, an uncharted portion of the [[Quendor|Great Underground Empire]] and the site of several mysterious disappearances, including the elves Fred and Max.  There were 17 possible endings.

==''Conquest at Quendor''==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:zcoq.jpg|thumb|left|75px|The cover of ''Conquest of Quendor'', illustrated by Dell Harris]] --&gt;
The fourth book in the ''Zork'' series, the "Conquest of Quendor", featured silly riddles reminiscent of ''[[Zork II]]''.
Bivotar and Juranda search for the Helm of Zork in an attempt to bring peace to the Land of Frobozz, in defiance of Jeearr, a riddle-telling demon.  There are 17 possible endings.

==Other books based on ''Zork''==
Of six novels published as "Infocom Books" by Avon Books between 1989–1991, two were directly based on ''Zork'': ''The Zork Chronicles'' by [[George Alec Effinger]] (1990) and ''The Lost City of Zork'' by [[Robin W. Bailey]] (1991).
