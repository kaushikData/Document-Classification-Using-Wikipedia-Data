{{Covert United States involvement in regime change}}
The '''1953 Iranian coup d'état''', known in [[Iran]] as the '''28 Mordad coup d'état''' ({{lang-fa|کودتای ۲۸ مرداد}}), was the [[Coup d'état|overthrow]] of [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]] [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the [[United Kingdom]] (under the name "'''Operation Boot'''") and the [[United States]] (under the name '''''TPAJAX'' Project'''{{sfn|Wilford|2013|p=164.

Published 18 June 2000 by The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/041600iran-cia-index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the first United States covert action to overthrow a foreign government during peacetime.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt;

Mossadegh had sought to [[audit]] the documents of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC), a British corporation (now part of [[BP]]) and to limit the company's control over Iranian [[oil reserves]].&lt;ref name="kinzer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kinzer |first1=Stephen |title=All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0470185490 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the refusal of the AIOC to co-operate with the Iranian government, the parliament ([[Majlis]]) voted to [[Nationalization|nationalize]] Iran's oil industry and to expel foreign corporate representatives from the country.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Persians" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milani|first=Abbas|title=The Shah|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Shah.html?id=8V1UhqWhKRwC|isbn=9780230115620|date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this vote, Britain instigated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil to pressure Iran economically.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Heiss in ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran'', pp. 178–200&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Britain mobilized its military to seize control of the British-built [[Abadan Refinery|Abadan oil refinery]], then the world's largest, but Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] opted instead to tighten the economic boycott&lt;ref&gt;''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran''&lt;/ref&gt; while using Iranian agents to undermine Mosaddegh's government.&lt;ref name="Kinzer" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Kinzer |first1=Stephen |title=All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror |date=2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780470185490 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv4B6C-wTG8C&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Judging Mosaddegh to be unreliable and fearing a Communist takeover in Iran, UK prime minister [[Winston Churchill]] and the [[Presidency of Dwight D.

Following the coup in 1953, a government under General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] was formed which allowed [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of Iran ([[Persian language|Persian]] for an Iranian king),&lt;ref name="Afkhami2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gholam Reza Afkhami|title=The Life and Times of the Shah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTVSPmyvtkAC&amp;pg=PA161|date=12 January 2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94216-5|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rule more firmly as [[monarch]].

In August 2013, sixty years afterward, the U.S. government formally acknowledged the U.S. role in the coup by releasing a bulk of previously classified government documents that show it was in charge of both the planning and the execution of the coup, including the bribing of Iranian politicians, security and army high-ranking officials, as well as pro-coup propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB435/ |title=CIA Confirms Role in 1953 Iran Coup|date=August 19, 2013 |website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu |publisher=The National Security Archive |access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA19532013admission_rt"&gt;[http://rt.com/usa/iran-coup-cia-operation-647/ CIA finally admits it masterminded Iran's 1953 coup] ''RT News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 19.8.2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup|title=CIA admits role in 1953 Iranian coup|author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan|author2=Richard Norton-Taylor|work=The Guardian|date=19 August 2013|access-date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA is quoted acknowledging the coup was carried out "under CIA direction" and "as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government".&lt;ref name="CIA19532013admission_cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/19/politics/cia-iran-1953-coup/?hpt=po_c2 |title=In declassified document, CIA acknowledges role in '53 Iran coup |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |access-date=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:59mossadeghprime minister1951.jpg|thumb|[[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], The [[Prime Minister of Iran]] in 1951]]

Throughout the 19th century, Iran was caught between two advancing imperial powers, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[British Empire|Britain]]. In 1892, the British diplomat [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Curzon]] described Iran as "pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out a game for the dominion of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Gasiorowski, ''U.S. Foreign Policy and the Shah: Building a Client State in Iran'' (Cornell University Press: 1991) p. 32; George N. Curzon, ''Persia and the Persian Question'', vol. 1. (London: Cass, 1966) pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter half of the 19th century, the [[concession (contract)|concession]] policies of the monarchy faced increased opposition. In 1872, a representative of British entrepreneur [[Paul Reuter]] met with the Iranian monarch [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] and agreed to fund the monarch's upcoming lavish visit to Europe in return for exclusive contracts for Iranian roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works, in which Reuter would receive stipulated sum for five years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. However, the so-called "[[Reuter concession]]" was never put into effect because of violent opposition at home and from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Elwell-Sutton, L. P. ''Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics'' (Lawrence and Wishart Ltd.: London) 1955. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 the Shah was forced to revoke a tobacco monopoly given to Major G.F Talbot, following [[Tobacco Protest|protests and a widespread tobacco boycott]].

In 1901, [[Mozzafar al-Din Shah Qajar]], granted a 60-year petroleum search concession to [[William Knox D'Arcy]].&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|33}} D'Arcy paid £20,000 (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK-GDP|0.02|1901|r=1}} million in {{Inflation/year|UK-GDP}}{{Inflation/fn|UK-GDP}}), according to journalist-turned-historian [[Stephen Kinzer]], and promised equal ownership shares, with 16% of any future net profit, as calculated by the company.&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|48}} However, the historian L.P. Elwell-Sutton wrote, in 1955, that "Persia's share was 'hardly spectacular' and no money changed hands."&lt;ref&gt;Elwell-Sutton, L. P. ''Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics'' (Lawrence and Wishart Ltd.: London) 1955. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July 1907, D'Arcy withdrew from his private holdings in Persia, and transferred them to the British-owned [[Burmah Oil|Burmah Oil Company]].&lt;ref name="Elwell-Sutton, L. P. p. 17"&gt;Elwell-Sutton, L. P. ''Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 May 1908 the company struck oil at a depth of {{convert|1180|ft|m}}&lt;ref&gt;Elwell-Sutton, L. P. ''Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics'' p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The company grew slowly until World War I, when Persia's strategic importance led the British government to buy a controlling share in the company, essentially nationalizing British oil production in Iran.

The British angered the Persians by intervening in their domestic affairs, including in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Mangol Bayat, ''Iran's First Revolution: Shi'ism and the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–1909'', Studies in Middle Eastern History, 336 p. (Oxford University Press, 1991). {{ISBN|0-19-506822-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Edward G., "The Persian Revolution of 1905–1909", Mage Publishers (July 1995). {{ISBN|0-934211-45-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afary, Janet, "The Iranian Constitutional Revolution, 1906–1911", [[Columbia University Press]]. 1996. {{ISBN|0-231-10351-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massive popular protests had forced Mozzafar al-Din Shah to allow for the [[Iran Constitution of 1906|Constitution of 1906]], which limited his powers. It allowed for a democratically elected parliament [[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]] to make the laws, and a prime minister to sign and carry them out. The Prime Minister would be appointed by the Shah after a vote of confidence from Parliament. Nevertheless, the new constitution gave the shah many executive powers as well. It allowed for the shah to issue royal decrees ([[Firman (decree)|Farman]]), gave him the power to appoint and dismiss prime ministers (upon votes of confidence from Parliament), appoint half of the members of the [[Senate of Iran|Senate]] (which was not convened until 1949),&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; and introduce bills to and even dissolve Parliament.&lt;ref name="Farrokh 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fis-iran.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fis-iran.org/en/resources/legaldoc/iranconstitution |title=Iran's 1906 Constitution |publisher=Foundation for Iranian Studies |date= |access-date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It abolished arbitrary rule, but the shah served as an executive, rather than in a ceremonial role; consequently when a shah was weak, the government was more democratic, but when the shah acted on his own, the democratic aspects of the government could be sidelined. The contradictory aspects of this constitution would cause conflicts in the future.&lt;ref name="fis-iran.org" /&gt; The Constitutional Revolution was opposed by the British and Russians, who attempted to subvert it through the backing of [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar]] (the son of Mozzafar-e-din Shah), who tried to break up the democratic government by force. A guerrilla movement led by [[Sattar Khan]] deposed him in 1910.&lt;ref name="Farrokh 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fis-iran.org" /&gt;

In the aftermath of [[World War I]] there was widespread political dissatisfaction with the royalty terms of the British petroleum concession, under the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC), whereby Persia received 16% of "net profits".&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt; In 1921, after years of severe mismanagement under the [[Qajar Dynasty]], a coup d'état (allegedly backed by the British) brought a general, [[Rezā Shāh|Reza Khan]], into the government. By 1923, he had become prime minister, and gained a reputation as an effective politician with a lack of corruption.&lt;ref name="Farrokh 2011" /&gt; By 1925 under his influence, Parliament voted to remove [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]] from the throne, and Reza Khan was crowned [[Rezā Shāh|Reza Shah Pahlavi]], of the [[Pahlavi Dynasty]]. Reza Shah began a rapid and successful modernization program in Persia, which up until that point had been considered to be among the most impoverished countries in the world.&lt;ref name="Farrokh 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrokh|first=Kaveh|title=Iran at War: 1500–1988|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Iran_at_War.html?id=dUHhTPdJ6yIC|isbn=9781780962214|date=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Reza Shah was also a very harsh ruler who did not tolerate dissent. By the 1930s, he had suppressed all opposition, and had sidelined the democratic aspects of the constitution. Opponents were jailed and in some cases even executed. While some agreed with his policies, arguing that it was necessary as Iran was in such turmoil, others argued that it was unjustified.&lt;ref name="Farrokh 2011" /&gt; One such opponent was a politician named [[Mohammad Mossadegh]], who was jailed in 1940. The experience gave him a lasting dislike for authoritarian rule and monarchy, and it helped make Mossadegh a dedicated advocate of complete oil nationalization in Iran.&lt;ref name="Milani Persians" /&gt;

Reza Shah attempted to attenuate the power of the colonial forces in Iran, and was successful to a large extent. However, he also needed them to help modernize the country. He did so by balancing the influence of various colonial powers, including that of Britain and Germany.&lt;ref name="Farrokh 2011" /&gt; In the 1930s, Reza Shah tried to terminate the APOC concession that the Qajar dynasty had granted, but Iran was still weak and Britain would not allow it. The concession was renegotiated on terms again favorable to the British (although the [[D'Arcy Concession]] was softened).&lt;ref name="Farrokh 2011" /&gt; On 21 March 1935, Reza Shah changed the name of the country from Persia to Iran. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was then renamed the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC).&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, ''Iranians'', Plume, (1998), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the USSR]], the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations]] forces and the [[Red Army]] [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|invaded Iran]]. Reza Shah had declared neutrality in World War II, and tried to balance between the two major powers, Britain and Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farrokh 2011" /&gt; The primary reason for the invasion was in order to secure Iran's oil fields and the [[Trans-Iranian Railway]] in order to deliver supplies to the USSR. Reza Shah was arrested, deposed, and exiled by the British, and some other prominent officials were jailed as well.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; Reza Shah's 22-year-old son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], became the Shah of Iran. The new Shah, unlike his father, was initially a mild leader and at times indecisive. During the 1940s he did not for most part take an independent role in the government, and much of Reza Shah's authoritarian policies were rolled back. Iranian democracy effectively was restored during this period as a result.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farrokh 2011" /&gt;

The British soldiers withdrew from Iran after the end of the war. However, under Stalin, the Soviet Union partly remained by sponsoring two "People's Democratic Republics" within Iran's borders. The [[Iran crisis of 1946|related conflict]] was ended when the US lobbied for the Iranian Army to reassert control over the two occupied territories. The earlier agreed upon Soviet-Iranian oil agreement would never be honored.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; Nationalist leaders in Iran became influential by seeking a reduction in long-term foreign interventions in their country—especially the oil concession which was very profitable for the West and not very profitable for Iran. The British-controlled AIOC refused to allow its books to be audited to determine whether the Iranian government was being paid what had been promised. British intransigence irked the Iranian population.

U.S. objectives in the Middle East remained the same between 1947 and 1952 but its strategy changed. Washington remained "publicly in solidarity and privately at odds" with Britain, its World War II ally. Britain's empire was steadily weakening, and with an eye on international crises, the U.S. re-appraised its interests and the risks of being identified with British colonial interests. "In [[Saudi Arabia]], to Britain's extreme disapproval, Washington endorsed the arrangement between [[Saudi Aramco|ARAMCO]] and Saudi Arabia in the 50/50 accord that had reverberations throughout the region."&lt;ref name="Minefield 1999 p. 34"&gt;''Notes From the Minefield: United States Intervention in Lebanon and the Middle East, 1945–1958'' by [[Boston University]] [[political science]] Professor Irene L.

==Oil nationalization crisis==
{{Main article|Nationalization of the Iranian oil industry}}

===Assassination attempt on the Shah, and the appointment of Mossadegh as Prime Minister===
In 1949, an assassin attempted to kill the Shah. Shocked by the experience and emboldened by public sympathy for his injury, the Shah began to take an increasingly active role in politics. He quickly organized the [[Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949|Iran Constituent Assembly]] to amend the constitution to increase his powers. He established the [[Senate of Iran]] which had been a part of the Constitution of 1906 but had never been convened. The Shah had the right to appoint half the senators and he chose men sympathetic to his aims.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; Mossadegh thought this increase in the Shah's political power was not democratic; he believed that the Shah should "reign, but not rule" in a manner similar to Europe's [[constitutional monarchies]]. Led by Mossadegh, political parties and opponents of the Shah's policies banded together to form a coalition known as the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]].&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; Oil nationalization was a major policy goal for the party.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt;

[[File:HosseinFatemi2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hossein Fatemi]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Iran's Minister of Foreign Affairs]]]]

By 1951, the National Front had won majority seats for the popularly elected [[Majlis]] (Parliament of Iran). According to Iran's constitution, the majority elected party in the parliament would give a vote of confidence for its prime minister candidate, after which the Shah would appoint the candidate to power. The Prime Minister [[Haj Ali Razmara]], who opposed the oil nationalization on technical grounds,&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt; was assassinated by the hardline [[Fada'iyan-e Islam|Fadaiyan e-Islam]] (whose spiritual leader the [[Ayatollah]] [[Abol-Ghasem Kashani|Abol-Qassem Kashani]], a mentor to the future [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], had been appointed Speaker of the Parliament by the National Front).&lt;ref name=Kressin /&gt; After a [[vote of confidence]] from the National Front dominated Parliament, Mossadegh was appointed [[prime minister of Iran]] by the Shah (replacing [[Hossein Ala]], who had replaced Razmara). Under heavy pressure by the National Front, the assassin of Razmara ([[Khalil Tahmasebi]]) was released and pardoned, thus proving the movement's power in Iranian politics.&lt;ref name=Kressin&gt;{{cite web|last=Kressin|first=Wolfgang K.|title=Prime Minister Mossadegh and Ayatullah Kashani From Unity to Enmity: As Viewed from the American Embassy in Tehran, June 1950 – August 1953 |date=May 1991 |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a239339.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the time being, Mossadegh and Kashani were allies of convenience, as Mossadegh saw that Kashani could mobilize the "religious masses", while Kashani wanted Mossadegh to create an Islamic state.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; Kashani's Fadaiyan mobs often violently attacked the opponents of nationalization and opponents of the National Front government, as well as "immoral objects", acting at times as unofficial "enforcers" for the movement.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt; However, by 1953 Mossadegh was becoming increasingly opposed to Kashani, as the latter was contributing to mass political instability in Iran. Kashani in turn, berated Mossadegh for not "Islamizing" Iran, as the latter was a firm believer in the separation of religion and state.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;

The Shah and his prime minister had an antagonistic relationship. Part of the problem stemmed from the fact that Mossadegh was connected by blood to the former royal [[Qajar dynasty]], and saw the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] king as a usurper to the throne. But the real issue stemmed from the fact that Mossadegh represented a pro-democratic force that wanted to temper the Shah's rule in Iranian politics. He wanted the Shah to be a [[ceremonial monarch]] rather than a ruling monarch, thus giving the elected government power over the un-elected Shah. While the constitution of Iran gave the Shah the power to rule directly, Mossadegh used the united National Front bloc and the widespread popular support for the oil nationalization vote (the latter which the Shah supported as well) in order to block the Shah's ability to act. As a result, the oil nationalization issue became increasingly intertwined with the Mossadegh's pro-democracy movement. The dejected Shah was angered by Mossadegh's "insolence" (according to Abbas Milani, he angrily paced in the rooms of his palace at the thought that he would be reduced to a [[figurehead]]). But Mossadegh and the oil nationalization's popularity prevented the Shah from acting against his prime minister (which was allowed under Iran's constitution, something that Mossadegh felt a king had no right to do). In 1952 the Shah dismissed Mossadegh, replacing him with [[Ahmad Qavam]] (a veteran prime minister). But widespread protests by Mossadegh supporters resulted in the Shah immediately reinstating him.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;

===Oil nationalization, the Abadan crisis, and rising tensions===
{{Further|Abadan Crisis|Abadan Crisis timeline}}In late 1951, Iran's Parliament in a near unanimous vote approved the oil nationalization agreement. The bill was widely popular among most Iranians, and generated a huge wave of nationalism, and immediately put Iran at loggerheads with Britain (the handful of MPs that disagreed with it voted for it as well in the face of overwhelming popular support, and the Fadaiyan's wrath).&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="irdc.ir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irdc.ir/en/calendar/259/default.aspx |title=The Revolutionary execution (assassination) of Ali Razmara by Fedaian-e-Islam |publisher=Islamic Revolution Document Center |date= |access-date=13 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109004131/http://www.irdc.ir/en/calendar/259/default.aspx |archivedate=9 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalization made Mossadegh instantly popular among millions of Iranians, cementing him as a national hero, and placing him and Iran at the center of worldwide attention.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="irdc.ir" /&gt; Many Iranians felt that for the first time in centuries, they were taking control of the affairs of their country. Many also expected that nationalization would result in a massive increase of wealth for Iranians.

Britain now faced the newly elected nationalist government in Iran where Mossadegh, with strong backing of the Iranian parliament and people, demanded more favorable concessionary arrangements, which Britain vigorously opposed.&lt;ref name="Minefield 1999 p. 34" /&gt;

The U.S. [[State Department]] not only rejected Britain's demand that it continue to be the primary beneficiary of Iranian oil reserves but "U.S. international oil interests were among the beneficiaries of the concessionary arrangements that followed nationalization."&lt;ref name="Minefield 1999 p. 35"&gt;''Notes From the Minefield: United States Intervention in Lebanon and the Middle East, 1945–1958'' by [[Boston University]] [[political science]] Professor Irene L. Gendzier, (Westview Press, 1999) {{ISBN|978-0-8133-6689-0}} p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohammad Mosaddegh attempted to negotiate with the AIOC, but the company rejected his proposed compromise. Mosaddegh's plan, based on the 1948 compromise between the [[Venezuela]]n Government of [[Romulo Gallegos]] and [[Creole Petroleum Corporation|Creole Petroleum]],&lt;ref name="Chatfield, Wayne 1976 p. 29"&gt;Chatfield, Wayne, ''The Creole Petroleum Corporation in Venezuela'' Ayer Publishing 1976 p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; would divide the profits from oil 50/50 between Iran and Britain. Against the recommendation of the United States, Britain refused this proposal and began planning to undermine and overthrow the Iranian government.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt;

In July 1951, the American diplomat [[Averell Harriman]] went to Iran to negotiate an Anglo-Iranian compromise, asking the Shah's help; his reply was that "in the face of public opinion, there was no way he could say a word against nationalisation".&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|106}} Harriman held a press conference in [[Tehran]], calling for reason and enthusiasm in confronting the "nationalisation crisis". As soon as he spoke, a journalist rose and shouted: "We and the Iranian people all support Premier Mosaddegh and oil nationalisation!" Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman shook his head in dismay.&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|106}}

On a visit to the United States in October 1951, Mossadegh—in spite of the popularity of nationalization in Iran—agreed in talks with [[George C. McGhee]] to a complex settlement of the crisis involving the sale of the [[Abadan Refinery]] to a non-British company and Iranian control of the extraction of crude oil. The US waited until [[Winston Churchill]] became prime minister to present the deal, believing he would be more flexible, but the deal was rejected by the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrahamian|first1=Ervand|title=The Coup: 1953, the CIA, and the roots of modern U.S.-Iranian relations|date=2013|publisher=New Press, The|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59558-826-5|pages=125–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Iranian Oil Company suffered decreased production, because of Iranian inexperience and the AIOC's orders that British technicians not work with them, thus provoking the [[Abadan Crisis]] that was aggravated by the [[Royal Navy]]'s blockading its export markets to pressure Iran to not nationalise its petroleum. The Iranian revenues were greater, because the profits went to Iran's national treasury rather than to private, foreign oil companies.&lt;ref name="Durham2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert B Durham|title=False Flags, Covert Operations, &amp; Propaganda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nswBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA260|date=25 August 2014|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-312-46288-5|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1951, the British had virtually ceased Abadan oil field production, forbidden British export to Iran of key British commodities (including sugar and steel),&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{rp|110}} and had frozen Iran's hard currency accounts in British banks.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, (1982) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] considered seizing the Abadan Oil Refinery by force, but instead settled on an embargo by the [[Royal Navy]], stopping any ship transporting Iranian oil for carrying so-called "stolen property". On his re-election as prime minister, [[Winston Churchill]] took an even harder stance against Iran. "&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|145}}

The United Kingdom took its anti-nationalisation [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. case|case against Iran]] to the [[International Court of Justice]] at [[The Hague]]; PM Mosaddegh said the world would learn of a "cruel and imperialistic country" stealing from a "needy and naked people". The court ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the case. Nevertheless, the British continued to enforce the embargo of Iranian oil. In August 1952, Iranian Prime Minister Mosaddegh invited an American oil executive to visit Iran and the Truman administration welcomed the invitation. However, the suggestion upset Churchill who insisted that the U.S. not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh: "Britain was supporting the Americans in Korea, he reminded Truman, and had a right to expect Anglo-American unity on Iran."&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|145}}

In mid-1952, Britain's embargo of Iranian oil was devastatingly effective. British agents in Tehran "worked to subvert" the government of Mosaddegh, who sought help from President Truman and then the World Bank but to no avail. "Iranians were becoming poorer and unhappier by the day" and Mosaddegh's political coalition was fraying. To make matters worse, the Speaker of the Parliament Ayatollah Kashani, Mossadegh's main clerical supporter, became increasingly opposed to the Prime Minister, because Mossadegh was not turning Iran into an Islamic state. By 1953, he had completely turned on him, and supported the coup, depriving Mossadegh of religious support, while giving it to the Shah.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;

In the Majlis election in the spring of 1952, Mosaddegh "had little to fear from a free vote, since despite the country's problems, he was widely admired as a hero. A free vote, however, was not what others were planning. British agents had fanned out across the country, bribing candidates, and the regional bosses who controlled them. They hoped to fill the Majlis with deputies who would vote to depose Mosaddegh. It would be a coup carried out by seemingly legal means."&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{rp|135}}

While the National Front, which often supported Mosaddegh won handily in the big cities, there was no one to monitor voting in the rural areas. Violence broke out in Abadan and other parts of the country where elections were hotly contested. Faced with having to leave Iran for The Hague where Britain was suing for control of Iranian oil, Mossadegh's cabinet voted to postpone the remainder of the election until after the return of the Iranian delegation from The Hague.&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{rp|136–137}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;While Mosaddegh dealt with political challenge, he faced another that most Iranians considered far more urgent. The British blockade of Iranian seaports meant that Iran was left without access to markets where it could sell its oil. The embargo had the effect of causing Iran to spiral into bankruptcy. Tens of thousands had lost their jobs at the Abadan refinery, and although most understood and passionately supported the idea of nationalisation, they naturally hoped that Mosaddegh would find a way to put them back to work. The only way he could do that was to sell oil.&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{rp|136–137}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To make matters worse, the Communist [[Tudeh Party]], which supported the [[Soviet Union]] and had attempted to kill the Shah only four years earlier, began to infiltrate the military&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Military Governor of Teheran: Black Book on Tudeh Officers Organization. 1956. {{ISBN|978-3-8442-7813-2}}. [http://www.epubli.de/shop/buch/Black-Book-on-Tudeh-Officers-Organization-Teymour-Bakhtiar-9783844278132/33792]&lt;/ref&gt; and send mobs to "support Mossadegh" (but in reality to marginalize all non-Communist opponents). Earlier, the Tudeh had denounced Mossadegh, but by 1953 they changed tack&lt;!-- not tact --&gt; and decided to "support" him.&lt;ref name="newsmine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=coldwar-imperialism/iran53/mossadegh-eccentric-nationalist-begets-strange-history.txt |title=Mossadegh: Eccentric nationalist begets strange history |publisher=NewsMine |date=16 April 2000 |access-date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tudeh violently attacked opponents under the guise of helping the prime minister (the cousin of the future queen of Iran, [[Farah Pahlavi]], was stabbed at the age of 13 in his school by Tudeh activists),&lt;ref name="Milani Persians"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milani|first=Abbas|title=Eminent Persians|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ixU33FaG_dgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Eminent+Persians#v=onepage&amp;q=Eminent%20Persians&amp;f=false|isbn=9780815609070|date=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unwittingly helped cause Mossadegh's reputation to decline, despite the fact that he never officially endorsed them.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; However, by 1953 he and the Tudeh had formed an unofficial alliance of convenience with each other; the Tudeh were the "foot soldiers" for his government, effectively replacing the Fadaiyan in that role, all the while secretly hoping that Mossadegh would institute communism.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; Pro-Shah mobs also carried out attacks on Mossadegh opponents, and there may have been some CIA coordination.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;

Worried about Britain's other interests in Iran, and (thanks to the Tudeh party)&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; believing that Iran's nationalism was really a Soviet-backed plot, Britain persuaded US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] that Iran was falling to the Soviets—effectively exploiting the American Cold War mindset. Since President [[Harry S. Truman]] was busy fighting a war in Korea, he did not agree to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. However, in 1953, when [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] became president, the UK convinced the U.S. to undertake a joint coup d'état.&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;

===Final months of Mossadegh's government===
[[File:1953 Iranian coup d'état - Tehran rally.jpg|thumb|Pro-Mosaddegh protests in Tehran, 16 August 1953]]

By 1953, economic tensions caused by the British embargo and political turmoil began to take a major toll upon Mossadegh's popularity and political power. The people were increasingly blaming him for the economic and political crisis. Political violence was becoming widespread in the form of street clashes between rival political groups.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; Mossadegh was losing popularity and support among the working class which had been his strongest supporters. As he lost support, he became more autocratic.&lt;ref name="newsmine.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iranchamber.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/oil_nationalization/oil_nationalization.php |title=History of Iran: Oil Nationalization |publisher=Iran Chamber Society |year=2014 |access-date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as August 1952, he began to rely on [[emergency powers]] to rule, generating controversy among his supporters.&lt;ref name="iranchamber.com" /&gt; After an assassination attempt upon one of his cabinet ministers and himself, he ordered the jailing of dozens of his political opponents. This act created widespread anger among much of the general public, and led to accusations that Mossadegh was becoming a dictator.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; The Tudeh party's unofficial alliance with Mossadegh led to fears of communism, and increasingly it was the communists who were taking part in pro-Mossadegh rallies, and attacking opponents.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;

By mid-1953 a mass of resignations by Mossadegh's parliamentary supporters reduced the National Front seats in Parliament. A [[Iranian parliamentary dissolution referendum, 1953|referendum to dissolve parliament]] and give the prime minister power to make law was submitted to voters, and it passed with 99.9 percent approval, 2,043,300 votes to 1300 votes against.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Iran between 2 Revolutions'', 1982, (p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt; The rigged referendum was widely seen by opponents as a dictatorial act, and the Shah and the rest of the government were effectively stripped of their powers to rule. When Mossadegh dissolved the Parliament, his opponents decried this act because he had effectively given himself "total power". Ironically, this un-democratic act by a democratically elected prime minister would result in a chain of events leading to his downfall.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;

The Shah himself initially opposed the coup plans, and supported the oil nationalization, but he joined after being informed by the CIA that he too would be "deposed" if he didn't play along (the experience left him with a lifelong awe of American power, and would contribute to his pro-US policies, while generating a hatred of the British).&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; Mossadegh's decision to dissolve Parliament also contributed to his decision.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;

==Execution of Operation Ajax==
[[File:MohammadMossadeqAdibBoroumand.jpg|thumb|left|Mohammad Mosaddegh, the leader of [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] and the democratic Prime Minister of Iran]]

The official pretext for the start of the coup was Mossadegh's decree to dissolve Parliament, giving himself and his cabinet complete power to rule, while effectively stripping the Shah of his powers.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Persians" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; It resulted in him being accused of giving himself "total and dictatorial powers."

Clear Nasiri had been sent by Shah arrest him and Shah had been prompted by British.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action was publicized within Iran by the CIA and in the United States by ''[[The New York Times]]''. Mossadegh's supporters (millions of National Front supporters as well as members of the Tudeh Party) took to the streets in violent protests.&lt;ref name=Kressin /&gt; Following the failed coup attempt, the Shah, accompanied by his second wife [[Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari]] and Aboul Fath Atabay&lt;ref name="had1dec" /&gt; fled to Baghdad. Arriving unannounced, the Shah asked for permission for himself and his consort to stay in Baghdad for a few days before continuing on to Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; After high-level Government consultations, they were escorted to the White House, the Iraqi Government's guest house, before flying to Italy in a plane flown by [[Mohammad Amir Khatami]].&lt;ref name=had1dec&gt;{{cite web|last=Hadidi|first=Ibrahim|title=New: Contemporary History: 19 August 1953 Coup|url=http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/New_Contemporary_History_August_19th_1953_Coup.htm|work=Iran Review|access-date=16 July 2013|date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first coup attempt failed, General Zahedi, declaring that he was the rightful prime minister of Iran, shuttled between multiple [[safe house]]s attempting to avoid arrest. Mossadegh ordered security forces to round up the coup plotters, and dozens were imprisoned. Believing that he had succeeded, and that he was in full control of the government, Mossadegh erred. Assuming that the coup had failed, he asked his supporters to return to their homes and to continue with their lives as normal. The Tudeh party members also returned to their homes, no longer carrying out enforcement duties.&lt;ref name=Kressin /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Persians" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; The CIA was ordered to leave Iran, although Kermit Roosevelt was slow to receive the message—allegedly due to MI6 interference—and eagerly continued to foment anti-Mossadegh unrest. The Eisenhower administration considered changing its policy to support Mossadegh, with undersecretary of state [[Walter Bedell Smith]] remarking on August 17: "Whatever his faults, Mossadegh had no love for the Russians and timely aid might enable him to keep Communism in check."{{sfn|Wilford|2013|pp=165–66}}

[[File:1953 Iranian coup d'état - Nematollah Nasiri.jpg|thumb|[[Nematollah Nassiri]]]]

However, General Zahedi, who was still on the run, met with the pro-Shah Ayatollah [[Mohammad Behbahani]] and other Shah supporters in secret. There (using CIA money deridingly known as "Behbahani dollars"), they quickly created a new plan. Already, much of the country was in shock from the Shah's flight from Iran, fears of communism, and Mossadegh's arrests of opponents. They capitalized on this sentiment in their plans. The Ayatollah Behbahani also used his influence to rally religious demonstrators against Mossadegh.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Persians" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;

On 19 August, hired infiltrators posing as Tudeh party members began to organize a "communist revolution". They came and encouraged real Tudeh members to join in. Soon, the Tudeh members took to the streets attacking virtually any symbols of capitalism, and looting private businesses and destroying shops. Much of southern Tehran's business district, including the bazaars, were vandalized. With sudden mass public revulsion against this act, the next part of Zahedi's plan came into action. From the vandalized bazaars, a second group of paid infiltrators, this time posing as Shah supporters, organized angry crowds of common Iranians who were terrified about a "communist revolution" and sickened by the violence.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Persians" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;

By the middle of the day, large crowds of regular citizens, armed with improvised weapons, took to the streets in mass demonstrations, and beat back the Tudeh party members. Under Zahedi's authority, the army left its barracks and drove off the communist Tudeh and then stormed all government buildings with the support of demonstrators. Mossadegh fled after a tank fired a single shell into his house, but he later turned himself in to the army's custody. To prevent further bloodshed, he refused a last attempt to organize his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/08/history-used-and-abused.html |title=History Used and Abused |publisher=FRONTLINE : Tehran Bureau |year=1993 |access-date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the day, Zahedi and the army were in control of the government.&lt;ref name="Kressin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Persians" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; Despite the CIA's role in creating the conditions for the coup, there is little evidence to suggest that Kermit Roosevelt or other CIA officials were directly responsible for the actions of the demonstrators or the army on August 19.

==United States role==
As a condition for restoring the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in 1954 the U.S. required removal of the AIOC's monopoly; five American petroleum companies, [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and the [[Compagnie Française des Pétroles]], were to draw Iran's petroleum after the successful coup d'état—Operation Ajax. The Shah declared this to be a "victory" for Iranians, with the massive influx of money from this agreement resolving the economic collapse from the last three years, and allowing him to carry out his planned modernization projects.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;

As part of that, the CIA organized anti-Communist guerrillas to fight the Tudeh Party if they seized power in the chaos of Operation Ajax.&lt;ref name="The 1953 Coup D'etat in Iran"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1953 Coup D'etat in Iran |url=http://iran.sa.utoronto.ca/coup/web_files/markcoup.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hOKkVZFE?url=http://iran.sa.utoronto.ca/coup/web_files/markcoup.html |archivedate=9 June 2009 |deadurl=no |access-date=6 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Released [[National Security Archive]] documents showed that Undersecretary of State [[Walter Bedell Smith]] reported that the CIA had agreed with [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] tribal leaders, in south Iran, to establish a clandestine safe haven from which U.S.-funded guerrillas and spies could operate.&lt;ref name="The 1953 Coup D'etat in Iran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="web.payk.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA Historical Paper No. 208 Clandestine Service History: Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran November 1952 – August 1953 by Donald N.

Operation Ajax's formal leader was senior CIA officer [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.]], while career agent [[Donald Wilber]] was the operational leader, planner, and executor of the deposition of Mosaddegh. The coup d'état depended on the impotent Shah's dismissing the popular and powerful Prime Minister and replacing him with General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], with help from Colonel [[Abbas Farzanegan]]—a man agreed upon by the British and Americans after determining his anti-Soviet politics.&lt;ref name="web.payk.net" /&gt;

The CIA sent [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Norman Schwarzkopf Sr.]] to persuade the exiled Shah to return to rule Iran. Schwarzkopf trained the security forces that would become known as [[SAVAK]] to secure the shah's hold on power.&lt;ref&gt;N. R. Keddie and M. J. Gasiorowski, eds., ''Neither East Nor West.

According to a heavily redacted CIA document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB126/iran980600.pdf |title=CIA document mentions who ordered the 1953 coup |format=PDF |date= |access-date=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; released to the [[National Security Archive]] in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information]] request, "Available documents do not indicate who authorized CIA to begin planning the operation, but it almost certainly was President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] himself. Eisenhower biographer [[Stephen Ambrose]] has written that the absence of documentation reflected the President's style."

The CIA document then quotes from the Ambrose biography of Eisenhower:{{quote| Before going into the operation, Ajax had to have the approval of the President. Eisenhower participated in none of the meetings that set up Ajax; he received only oral reports on the plan; and he did not discuss it with his Cabinet or the NSC. Establishing a pattern he would hold to throughout his Presidency, he kept his distance and left no documents behind that could implicate the President in any projected coup. But in the privacy of the Oval Office, over cocktails, he was kept informed by Foster Dulles, and he maintained a tight control over the activities of the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenhower, vol.2, The President'' [[Stephen E.

CIA officer [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.]], the grandson of former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], carried out the operation planned by CIA agent [[Donald Wilber]].

During the coup, Roosevelt and Wilber, representatives of the Eisenhower administration, bribed Iranian government officials, reporters, and businessmen. They also bribed street thugs to support the Shah and oppose Mosaddegh.&lt;ref name="How to Overthrow A Government Pt. 1"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/print.pl?sid=04/03/05/1542249 How to Overthrow A Government Pt. 1] on 5 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The deposed Iranian leader, Mosaddegh, was taken to jail and Iranian General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] named himself prime minister in the new, pro-western government.

Another tactic Roosevelt admitted to using was bribing demonstrators into attacking symbols of the Shah, while chanting pro-Mossadegh slogans. As king, the Shah was largely seen as a symbol of Iran at the time by many Iranians and monarchists. Roosevelt declared that the more that these agents showed their hate for the Shah and attacked his symbols, the more it caused the average Iranian citizen to dislike and distrust Mossadegh.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Countercoup: The Struggle for the Control of Iran'', Kermit Roosevelt, (New York: McGraw Hill) 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

While the broad outlines of the operation are known, "...the C.I.A.'s records were widely thought by historians to have the potential to add depth and clarity to a famous but little-documented intelligence operation," reporter Tim Weiner wrote in ''The New York Times'' 29 May 1997.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/29/us/cia-destroyed-files-on-1953-iran-coup.html "C.I.A. Destroyed Files on 1953 Iran Coup"] 29 May 1997 ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Central Intelligence Agency, which has repeatedly pledged for more than five years to make public the files from its secret mission to overthrow the government of Iran in 1953, said today that it had destroyed or lost almost all the documents decades ago."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/08/world/cia-is-slow-to-tell-early-cold-war-secrets.html C.I.A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A historian who was a member of the C.I.A. staff in 1992 and 1993 said in an interview today that the records were obliterated by "a culture of destruction" at the agency. The historian, Nick Cullather, said he believed that records on other major cold war covert operations had been burned, including those on secret missions in [[Indonesia]] in the 1950s and a successful C.I.A.-sponsored coup in [[Guyana]] in the early 1960s.

"Iran—there's nothing", Mr. Cullather said. "Indonesia—very little. Guyana—that was burned."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Donald Wilber]], one of the CIA officers who planned the 1953 coup in Iran, wrote an account titled, ''Clandestine Service History Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran: November 1952 – August 1953''. Wilber said one goal of the coup was to strengthen the Shah.

In 2000, [[James Risen]] at ''The New York Times'' obtained the previously secret CIA version of the coup written by Wilber and summarized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Risen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/16/world/secrets-history-cia-iran-special-report-plot-convulsed-iran-53-79.html |title=Secrets Of History: The C.I.A. in Iran{{snd}}A special report. How a Plot Convulsed Iran in '53 (and in '79)|work=The New York Times |date=2000-04-16 |access-date=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; its contents, which includes the following.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In early August, the C.I.A. stepped up the pressure. Iranian operatives pretending to be Communists threatened Muslim leaders with "savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh," seeking to stir anti-Communist sentiment in the religious community.

In addition, the secret history says, the house of at least one prominent Muslim was bombed by C.I.A. agents posing as Communists. It does not say whether anyone was hurt in this attack.

The agency was also intensifying its propaganda campaign. A leading newspaper owner was granted a personal loan of about $45,000, "in the belief that this would make his organ amenable to our purposes."

But the shah remained intransigent. In a 1 August meeting with General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Sr.|Norman Schwarzkopf]], he refused to sign the C.I.A.-written decrees firing Mr. Mossadegh and appointing General Zahedi. He said he doubted that the army would support him in a showdown.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[National Security Archive]] at [[George Washington University]] contains the full account by Wilber, along with many other coup-related documents and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB28/index.html |title=The Secret CIA History of the Iran Coup, 1953|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|date=29 November 2000 |access-date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB126/index.htm|title=Mohammed Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|date=22 June 2004|access-date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB435/|title = CIA Confirms Role in 1953 Iran Coup|date=19 August 2013|work=National Security Archive|access-date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 1973 telephone conversation made public in 2009, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] told CIA Director [[Richard Helms]], who was awaiting Senate confirmation to become the new [[U.S. Ambassador]] to Iran, that Nixon wanted Helms to be a "regional ambassador" to Persian Gulf oil states, and noted that Helms had been a schoolmate of [[Shah Reza Pahlavi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/tape036/036-113.mp3 Nixon White House Tapes January 1973], Nixon Presidential Library &amp; Museum, released on 23 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release of U.S. government records and official acknowledgement===
In August 2013, on the sixtieth anniversary of the coup, the U.S. government released documents showing they were involved in staging the coup. The documents also describe the motivations behind the coup and the strategies used to stage it.&lt;ref name="FP 2013" /&gt; The UK had sought to censor information regarding its role in the coup; a significant number of documents about the coup still remained classified.&lt;ref name="Guardian 19.8.2013" /&gt; The release of the declassified documents, which marked the first U.S. official acknowledgement of its role, was seen as a goodwill gesture on the part of the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/iran-president-hassan-rouhani-un-speech |title=Iran's Rouhani tells UN: we pose no threat to the world: Iranian president addresses UN general assembly and says the world is 'tired of war' and US should not threaten force in Syria |date=September 25, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 19.8.2013" /&gt;

In June 2017, the United States State Department's Office of the Historian released its revised historical account of the event. The volume of historical records "focuses on the evolution of U.S. thinking on Iran as well as the U.S. Government covert operation that resulted in Mosadeq's overthrow on August 19, 1953".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1951-54Iran/preface|title=Foreign Relations of the United States,  Iran, 1951–1954|work=Office of the Historian|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some of the relevant records were destroyed long ago, the release contains a collection of roughly 1,000 pages, only a small number of which remain classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2017/06/iran-frus-release/|title=Iran 1953 Covert History Quietly Released|work=Federation of American Scientists|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One revelation is that the CIA "attempted to call off the failing coup but was salvaged by an insubordinate spy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/20/64-years-later-cia-finally-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-iran-tehran-oil/|title=64 Years Later, CIA Finally Releases Details of Iranian Coup|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, the National Security Archive released an additional document, a declassified British memo, alleging that the United States Embassy sent "large sums of money" to "influential people"—namely senior Iranian clerics—in the days leading up to Mosaddeq's overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/iran/2018-03-07/new-findings-clerical-involvement-1953-coup-iran|title=New Findings on Clerical Involvement in the 1953 Coup in Iran|date=March 7, 2018|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States financial support===
The CIA paid a large sum to carry out the operation. Depending on the expenses to be counted, the final cost is estimated to vary from $100,000 to $20 million. CIA gave Zahedi's government $5 million after the coup&lt;ref name=Kinzer /&gt; with Zahedi him self receiving an extra million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gasiorowski |first1=Mark J. |title=U.S. foreign policy and the Shah: building a client state in Iran |date=1991 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=9780801424120 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JE3PYfjBStAC&amp;q=%241+million |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States motives===
Historians disagree on what motivated the United States to change its policy towards Iran and stage the coup. Middle East historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]] identified the coup d'état as "a classic case of nationalism clashing with imperialism in the Third World". He states that Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] admitted the {{" '}}Communist threat' was a smokescreen" in responding to President Eisenhower's claim that the Tudeh party was about to assume power.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1953 Coup in Iran, ''Science &amp; Society'', 65 (2), Summer 2001, pp. 182–215 |url=http://www.geocities.com/thelasian/1953-coup-Iran-CIA.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kg6nFIXE?url=http://www.geocities.com/thelasian/1953-coup-Iran-CIA.html |archivedate=21 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Throughout the crisis, the "communist danger" was more of a rhetorical device than a real issue—i.e. it was part of the cold-war discourse ...The Tudeh was no match for the armed tribes and the 129,000-man military. What is more, the British and Americans had enough inside information to be confident that the party had no plans to initiate armed insurrection. At the beginning of the crisis, when the Truman administration was under the impression a compromise was possible, Acheson had stressed the communist danger, and warned if Mosaddegh was not helped, the Tudeh would take over. The (British) Foreign Office had retorted that the Tudeh was no real threat. But, in August 1953, when the Foreign Office echoed the Eisenhower administration's claim that the Tudeh was about to take over, Acheson now retorted that there was no such communist danger.

Abrahamian states that Iran's oil was the central focus of the coup, for both the British and the Americans, though "much of the discourse at the time linked it to the Cold War".&lt;ref name=Abrahamian2003 /&gt; Abrahamian wrote, "If Mosaddegh had succeeded in nationalizing the British oil industry in Iran, that would have set an example and was seen at that time by the Americans as a threat to U.S. oil interests throughout the world, because other countries would do the same."&lt;ref name=Abrahamian2003 /&gt; Mosaddegh did not want any compromise solution that allowed a degree of foreign control.

Tirman points out that agricultural land owners were politically dominant in Iran, well into the 1960s and the monarch, Reza Shah's aggressive land expropriation policies—to the benefit of himself and his supporters—resulted in the Iranian government being Iran's largest land owner. "The landlords and oil producers had new backing, moreover, as American interests were for the first time exerted in Iran. The Cold War was starting, and Soviet challenges were seen in every leftist movement. But the reformers were at root nationalists, not communists, and the issue that galvanized them above all others was the control of oil."&lt;ref&gt;''Spoils of War: The Human Cost of America's Arms Trade'' by John Tirman (Free Press 1997) P. 30 {{ISBN|978-0-684-82726-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that oil was the central motivator behind the coup has been echoed in the popular media by authors such as [[Robert Byrd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrd|first=Robert|title=Losing America: confronting a reckless and arrogant presidency|publisher=W.

However, Middle East political scientist [[Mark Gasiorowski]] states that while, on the face of it, there is considerable merit to the argument that U.S. policymakers helped U.S. oil companies gain a share in Iranian oil production after the coup, "it seems more plausible to argue that U.S. policymakers were motivated mainly by fears of a communist takeover in Iran, and that the involvement of U.S. companies was sought mainly to prevent this from occurring. The Cold War was at its height in the early 1950s, and the Soviet Union was viewed as an expansionist power seeking world domination. Eisenhower had made the Soviet threat a key issue in the 1952 elections, accusing the Democrats of being soft on communism and of having 'lost China.' Once in power, the new administration quickly sought to put its views into practice."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gasiorowski|first=Mark J|title=The 1953 Coup D'etat in Iran The 1953 Coup D'etat in Iran|date=August 1987|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume= 19|issue= 3|pages= 261–86|jstor=163655|doi=10.1017/s0020743800056737}} A version is available for public access at [http://iran.sa.utoronto.ca/coup/web_files/markcoup.html Web publication accessed from Document Revision: 1.4 Last Updated: 1998/08/23].

Gasiorowski further states "the major U.S. oil companies were not interested in Iran at this time. A glut existed in the world oil market. The U.S. majors had increased their production in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 1951 in order to make up for the loss of Iranian production; operating in Iran would force them to cut back production in these countries which would create tensions with Saudi and Kuwaiti leaders. Furthermore, if nationalist sentiments remained high in Iran, production there would be risky. U.S. oil companies had shown no interest in Iran in 1951 and 1952. By late 1952, the Truman administration had come to believe that participation by U.S. companies in the production of Iranian oil was essential to maintain stability in Iran and keep Iran out of Soviet hands. In order to gain the participation of the major U.S. oil companies, Truman offered to scale back a large anti-trust case then being brought against them. The Eisenhower administration shared Truman's views on the participation of U.S. companies in Iran and also agreed to scale back the anti-trust case. Thus, not only did U.S. majors not want to participate in Iran at this time, it took a major effort by U.S. policymakers to persuade them to become involved."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt;

In 2004, Gasiorowski edited a book on the coup&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski Mosaddeq" /&gt; arguing that "the climate of intense cold war rivalry between the superpowers, together with Iran's strategic vital location between the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf oil fields, led U.S. officials to believe that they had to take whatever steps were necessary to prevent Iran from falling into Soviet hands."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski Mosaddeq" /&gt; While "these concerns seem vastly overblown today"&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski Mosaddeq" /&gt; the pattern of "the 1945–46 Azerbaijan crisis, the consolidation of Soviet control in Eastern Europe, the communist triumph in China, and the [[Korean War]]—and with the [[Red Scare]] at its height in the United States"&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski Mosaddeq" /&gt; would not allow U.S. officials to risk allowing the Tudeh Party to gain power in Iran.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski Mosaddeq" /&gt; Furthermore, "U.S. officials believed that resolving the oil dispute was essential for restoring stability in Iran, and after March 1953 it appeared that the dispute could be resolved only at the expense either of Britain or of Mosaddeq."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski Mosaddeq" /&gt; He concludes "it was geostrategic considerations, rather than a desire to destroy Mosaddeq's movement, to establish a dictatorship in Iran or to gain control over Iran's oil, that persuaded U.S. officials to undertake the coup."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski Mosaddeq"&gt;Gasiorowski, ''Mosaddeq'', p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hojoom be manzel dr mosadegh.JPG|thumb|Mosaddegh's house after attack]]
Faced with choosing between British interests and Iran, the U.S. chose Britain, Gasiorowski said. "Britain was the closest ally of the United States, and the two countries were working as partners on a wide range of vitally important matters throughout the world at this time. Preserving this close relationship was more important to U.S. officials than saving Mosaddeq's tottering regime." A year earlier, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] used Britain's support for the U.S. in the Cold War to insist the United States not undermine his campaign to isolate Mosaddegh. "Britain was supporting the Americans in Korea, he reminded [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]], and had a right to expect 'Anglo-American unity' on Iran."&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|145}}

The two main winners of World War II, who had been [[Allies]] during the war, became superpowers and competitors as soon as the war ended, each with their own spheres of influence and client states. After the 1953 coup, Iran became one of the [[client state]]s of the United States. In his earlier book, ''U.S. Foreign Policy and the Shah: Building a Client State in Iran'', Gasiorowski identifies the client states of the United States and of the Soviet Union during 1954–1977. Gasiorowski identified Cambodia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Iran, Laos, Nicaragua, Panama, the Philippines, South Korea, South Vietnam, and Taiwan as strong client states of the United States and identified those that were moderately important to the U.S. as Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Greece, Haiti, Honduras, Israel, Jordan, Liberia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, and Zaire. He named Argentina, Chile, Ethiopia, Japan, and Peru as "weak" client states of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. Foreign Policy and the Shah: Building a Client State in Iran'' by Mark J. Gasiorowski (Cornell University Press: 1991) p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasiorowski identified Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, North Vietnam, and Rumania as "strong client states" of the Soviet Union, and Afghanistan, Egypt, Guinea, North Korea, Somalia, and Syria as moderately important client states. Mali and South Yemen were classified as weak client states of the Soviet Union.

According to Kinzer, for most Americans, the crisis in Iran became just part of the conflict between Communism and "the Free world".&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|84}} "A great sense of fear, particularly the fear of encirclement, shaped American consciousness during this period. ... Soviet power had already subdued Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Communist governments were imposed on Bulgaria and Romania in 1946, Hungary and Poland in 1947, and Czechoslovakia in 1948. Albania and Yugoslavia also turned to communism. Greek communists made a violent bid for power. Soviet soldiers blocked land routes to Berlin for sixteen months. In 1949, the Soviet Union successfully [[RDS-1|tested]] a nuclear weapon. That same year, pro-Western forces in China lost their [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]] to communists led by [[Mao Zedong]]. From Washington, it seemed that enemies were on the march everywhere."&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|84}} Consequently, "the United States, challenged by what most Americans saw as a relentless communist advance, slowly ceased to view Iran as a country with a unique history that faced a unique political challenge."&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|205}} Some historians, including [[Douglas Little]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=Douglas|title=American Orientalism: The United States and the Middle East since 1945|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2003|page=216|isbn=978-1-86064-889-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p71CacOnop0C&amp;pg=PA216| access-date=18 March 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abbas Milani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milani|first=Abbas|title=Eminent Persians: The Men and Women Who Made Modern Iran, 1941–1979|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2008|volume=Volume 1|isbn=978-0-8156-0907-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixU33FaG_dgC&amp;pg=PA244| access-date=18 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Lenczowski]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenczowski|first=George|title=American Presidents and the Middle East|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1990|page=36|isbn=978-0-8223-0972-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; have echoed the view that fears of a communist takeover or Soviet influence motivated the U.S. to intervene.

On 11 May 1951, prior to the overthrow of Mossadegh, [[Adolf A. Berle]] warned the U.S. State Department that U.S. "control of the Middle East was at stake, which, with its Persian Gulf oil, meant 'substantial control of the world.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-39cA1NL9gC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=with+its+Persian+Gulf+oil,+meant+%E2%80%9Csubstantial+control+of+the+world.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XcZs5aJgin&amp;sig=L-vw-uLI-qLdCm9BWD74rW8cWjE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Xa99UMnPHoqc2QWy3oGgAQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=with%20its%20Persian%20Gulf%20oil%2C%20meant%20%E2%80%9Csubstantial%20control%20of%20the%20world.&amp;f=false "Three Kings: The Rise of an American Empire in the Middle East After World War II"] Lloyd C. Gardner, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===News coverage in the United States and Great Britain===
When Mossadegh called for the dissolution of the Majlis in August 1953, the editors of the ''New York Times'' gave the opinion that: "A plebiscite more fantastic and farcical than any ever held under Hitler or Stalin is now being staged in Iran by Premier Mossadegh in an effort to make himself unchallenged dictator of the country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yYFsedyikjMC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42 "The U.S. Press and Iran: Foreign Policy and the Journalism of Deference"] by William A. Dorman, Mansour Farhang, 24 August 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the coup, the ''New York Times'' wrote on 6 August 1954, that a new oil "agreement between Iran and a consortium of foreign oil companies" was "good news indeed".&lt;ref name="NYT 6 August 1954"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/08/06/archives/the-iranian-accord.html |title=The Iranian Accord |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 August 1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Costly as the dispute over Iranian oil has been to all concerned, the affair may yet be proved worthwhile if lessons are learned from it: Underdeveloped countries with rich resources now have an object lesson in the heavy cost that must be paid by one of their number which goes berserk with fanatical nationalism. It is perhaps too much to hope that Iran's experience will prevent the rise of Mossadeghs in other countries, but that experience may at least strengthen the hands of more reasonable and more far-seeing leaders. In some circles in Great Britain the charge will be pushed that American "imperialism"—in the shape of the American oil firms in the consortium!—has once again elbowed Britain from a historic stronghold.&lt;ref name="NYT 6 August 1954" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The British government used the [[BBC]]'s Persian service for advancing its propaganda against Mosaddegh. Anti-Mosaddegh material were repeatedly aired on the radio channel to the extent that Iranian staff at the BBC Persian radio went on strike to protest the move.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Gillespie &amp; Alban Webb (2013). ''Diasporas and Diplomacy: Cosmopolitan contact zones at the BBC World Service 1932–2012'', pp. 129–32. Routledge [https://books.google.com/books?id=k-DIW9lntAMC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=bbc+mossadeq&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BYYvKKgpQu&amp;sig=gPF266XhclFL-5lv5ipHF3EH4Cs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9fMDUu2VAonuqwGtmIC4Cw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bbc%20mossadeq&amp;f=false Link] " 'when it came to reporting adversely on Mossadeq, for two weeks all Iranian broadcasters disappeared. The BBC had no choice but to bring in English people who spoke Persian because the Iranians had gone on strike' "&lt;/ref&gt;
The documentary ''Cinematograph'' aired on 18 August 2011 on the anniversary of the coup. In it, BBC admitted for the first time to the role of BBC Persian radio as the propaganda arm of the British government in Iran. The ''Cinematograph'' narrator said:
{{quote|The British government used the BBC Persian radio for advancing its propaganda against Mosaddegh and anti-Mosaddegh material were repeatedly aired on the radio channel to the extent that Iranian staff at the BBC Persian radio went on strike to protest the move.}}

The documentary quoted a 21 July 1951 classified document in which a Foreign Office official thanked the British ambassador for his proposals that were precisely followed by the BBC Persian radio to strengthen its propaganda against Mosaddegh:

{{quote|The BBC had already made most of the points which you listed, but they were very glad to have an indication from you of what was likely to be most effective and will arrange their programme accordingly... We should also avoid direct attacks on the 'ruling classes' since it seems probable that we may want to deal with a government drawn from those classes should Mosaddegh fall.}}
The document further stressed that the Foreign Office "shall be grateful for [the ambassador's] comments on the propaganda line we have proposed".&lt;ref name=presstv21&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC admits role in 1953 Iranian coup|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/195008.html|access-date=16 July 2013|work=Press TV|date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early account of the CIA's role in the coup appeared in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in late 1954, purporting to explain how "the strategic little nation of Iran was rescued from the closing clutch of Moscow." The report was approved by the CIA, and its authors may have been assisted by [[Kermit Roosevelt Jr.]], who had written for the ''Post'' before.{{sfn|Wilford|2013|pp=173–74}}

==Britain role==
Despite the British government's pressure, the [[National Security Archive]] released two declassified documents in August 2017 which confirm the British solicitation of the United States' assistance in ousting Mosaddeq.&lt;ref name="usdocconf1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1951-54Iran Foreign Relations of the United States, 1952-1954, Iran, 1951–1954] Office of the Historian.&lt;/ref&gt; According to these records, the British first approached the American government about a plan for the coup in November 1952&lt;ref name=":nsarchive" /&gt; "repeatedly" asking U.S. to join the coup,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9ea5c5e0-7c50-11e7-9108-edda0bcbc928|title=Britain pressed US to join Iran coup against Mosaddegh|last=Lynch|first=David J|date=8 August 2017|website=Financial Tribune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the Mosaddeq government would be ineffective in preventing a communist takeover,&lt;ref name=":nsarchive" /&gt; and that Mossadegh was a threat to America's global fight against communism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McQuade |first1=Joseph |title=How the CIA toppled Iranian democracy |url=https://theconversation.com/how-the-cia-toppled-iranian-democracy-81628 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they believed necessitated action; the records also state that UK and U.S. spy agencies had by then had "very tentative and preliminary discussions regarding the practicability of such a move".&lt;ref name="usdocconf2" /&gt; At the time, the American government was already preparing to aid Mosaddeq in his oil dealings with the British, and believed him to be anti-communist—considerations which made the U.S. government skeptical of the plot. Since President Truman's term was drawing to a close in January 1953, and there was too much uncertainty and danger associated with the plot, the U.S. government decided not to take action against Mosaddeq at the time.&lt;ref name=":nsarchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//dc.html?doc=3914380-02-State-Department-Memorandum-of-Conversation|title=British Proposal to Organize a Coup d'etat in Iran|date=8 August 2017|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|access-date=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1952 documents, it was [[Christopher Steel (diplomat)|Christopher Steel]], the No 2 official in the British embassy in Washington, who "pitched" the idea of the coup to U.S. officials amid the U.S.-Britain talks which had began in October. The document also says that the British officials rejected [[Paul Nitze]]'s suggestion that, instead of executing a coup, they mount a "campaign" against Ayatollah Abolqasem Kashani, "a leading opponent of British involvement in Iran's oil industry", and the communist Tudeh Party. They "pressed US for a decision" since the knew "the Truman administration was in its final weeks".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Wilber, the British Secret Intelligence Service worked with CIA to form a propaganda campaign via "the press, handbills and the Tehran clergy" to "weaken the Mossadeq government in any way possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Merica |first1=Dan |last2=Hanna |first2=Jason |title=In declassified document, CIA acknowledges role in 1953 Iran coup |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/19/politics/cia-iran-1953-coup/ |accessdate=16 August 2018 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nationalization of the Iranian oil industry|Oil nationalization law]] led to a "direct conflict" between Mossadegh and the British government. So, Britain tried to regain its control over oil industry of Iran by following a "three-track strategy" aimed at either "pressuring him into a favorable settlement or by removing him from the office." The three component of Britain strategy was: I) "legal maneuvers" including refusing direct negotiation with Mossadegh, II) Imposing economic sanctions on Iran accompanied by performing war games in the region and III) Removal of Mossadegh through "covert political action".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The coup has been said to have "left a profound and long-lasting legacy."&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''A History of Modern Iran'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''Tortured Confessions'', (1999), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blowback===
According to the history based on documents released to the [[National Security Archive]] and reflected in the book ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran,'' the coup caused long-lasting damage to the U.S. reputation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The '28 Mordad' coup, as it is known by its Persian date [in the [[Solar Hijri calendar]]], was a watershed for Iran, for the Middle East and for the standing of the United States in the region. The joint U.S.-British operation ended Iran's drive to assert sovereign control over its own resources and helped put an end to a vibrant chapter in the history of the country's nationalist and democratic movements. These consequences resonated with dramatic effect in later years. When the Shah finally fell in 1979, memories of the U.S. intervention in 1953, which made possible the monarch's subsequent, and increasingly unpopular, 25-year reign intensified the anti-American character of the revolution in the minds of many Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=America's Role in Iran's Unrest|last=Dowlin|first=Joan E.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joan-e-dowlin/americas-role-in-irans-un_b_216831.html|work=Huffington Post|location=USA|date=17 June 2009|access-date=21 June 2009}}&lt;br /&gt;Quoting from Gasiorowski and Byrne, ''Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authoritarian monarch appreciated the coup, Kermit Roosevelt wrote in his account of the affair. "'I owe my throne to God, my people, my army and to you!' By 'you' he [the shah] meant me and the two countries—Great Britain and the United States—I was representing. We were all heroes."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

On 16 June 2000, ''The New York Times'' published the secret CIA report, "Clandestine Service History, Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran, November 1952 – August 1953," partly explaining the coup from CIA agent Wilber's perspective. In a related story, ''The New York Times'' reporter [[James Risen]] penned a story revealing that Wilber's report, hidden for nearly five decades, had recently come to light.

In the summer of 2001, Ervand Abrahamian writes in the journal ''Science &amp; Society'' that Wilber's version of the coup was missing key information some of which was available elsewhere.

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''The New York Times'' recently leaked a CIA report on the 1953 American-British overthrow of Mosaddeq, Iran's Prime Minister. It billed the report as a secret history of the secret coup, and treated it as an invaluable substitute for the U.S. files that remain inaccessible. But a reconstruction of the coup from other sources, especially from the archives of the British Foreign Office, indicates that this report is highly sanitized. It glosses over such sensitive issues as the crucial participation of the U.S. ambassador in the actual overthrow; the role of U.S. military advisers; the harnessing of local Nazis and Muslim terrorists; and the use of assassinations to destabilize the government. What is more, it places the coup in the context of the Cold War rather than that of the Anglo-Iranian oil crisis—a classic case of nationalism clashing with imperialism in the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The 1953 Coup in Iran'' by Ervand Abrahamian.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review of [[Tim Weiner]]'s ''Legacy of Ashes'', historian [[Michael Beschloss]] wrote, "Mr. Weiner argues that a bad C.I.A. track record has encouraged many of our gravest contemporary problems... A generation of Iranians grew up knowing that the C.I.A. had installed the shah," Mr. Weiner notes. "In time, the chaos that the agency had created in the streets of Tehran would return to haunt the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/books/12besc.html "The C.I.A.'s Missteps, From Past to Present"] ''The New York Times'', 12 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] considered the coup a success, but, given its [[Blowback (intelligence)|blowback]], that opinion is no longer generally held, because of its "haunting and terrible legacy".&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|215}} In 2000, [[Madeleine Albright]], [[U.S. Secretary of State]], said that intervention by the U.S. in the internal affairs of Iran was a setback for democratic government.&lt;ref name="transcripts.cnn.com"&gt;"[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0004/19/i_ins.00.html U.S. Comes Clean About The Coup In Iran]", [[CNN]], 19 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The comments were not an apology.

"For many Iranians, the coup demonstrated duplicity by the United States, which presented itself as a defender of freedom but did not hesitate to use underhanded methods to overthrow a democratically elected government to suit its own economic and strategic interests", the Agence France-Presse reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j8-a9Bpq471PDjYA2z6WazPmIZqw |title="Obama admits U.S. involvement in 1953 Iran coup" 4 June 2009, Agence France-Presse |date=2009-06-04 |access-date=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Supreme Court Justice]] [[William O. Douglas]], who visited Iran both before and after the coup, wrote that "When Mossadegh and Persia started basic reforms, we became alarmed. We united with the British to destroy him; we succeeded; and ever since, our name has not been an honored one in the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;Kinzer, Stephen, ''Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq'' (Henry Holt and Company 2006). p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
When the Shah returned to Iran after the coup, he was greeted by a cheering crowd. He wrote in his memoirs that while he had been a king for over a decade, for the first time he felt that the people had "elected" and "approved" of him, and that he had a "legitimate" popular mandate in order to carry out his reforms (although some in the crowd may have been bribed). The Shah however, never was able to remove the reputation of being a "foreign imposed" ruler among non-royalist Iranians. However the Shah throughout his rule continued to assume that he was supported by virtually everybody in Iran, and sank into deep dejection when in 1978 massive mobs demanded his ousting. The incident left him in awe of American power, while it also gave him a deep hatred of the British.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; When the Shah attempted during the 1970s to once again control the oil prices (through [[OPEC]]), and cancel the same oil consortium agreement that caused the 1953 coup, it resulted in a massive decline in US support for the Shah, and ironically, hastened his downfall.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Andrew Scott|title=The Oil Kings|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oil_Kings.html?id=kP_WxbkSokIC|isbn=9781439157138|date=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An immediate consequence of the coup d'état was the suppression of all republicanist&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; political dissent, especially the liberal and nationalist opposition umbrella group [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] as well as the (Communist) [[Tudeh]] party, and concentration of political power in the Shah and his courtiers.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'', (University of California 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The minister of Foreign Affairs and the closest associate of Mosaddegh, [[Hossein Fatemi]], was executed by order of the Shah's military court by firing squad on 10 November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 11 November 1954, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kinzer, "The triumphant Shah [Pahlavi] ordered the execution of several dozen military officers and student leaders who had been closely associated with Mohammad Mossadegh"&lt;ref&gt;''Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq'' by Stephen Kinzer (Henry Holt and Company 2006). p. 200. {{ISBN|978-0805082401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the post-coup d'état political repression between 1953 and 1958, the Shah outlawed the National Front, and arrested most of its leaders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Iran in Revolution: The Opposition Forces by E Abrahamian – MERIP Reports&lt;/ref&gt; The Shah personally spared Mossadegh the death penalty, and he was given 3 years in prison, followed by house arrest for life.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;
[[File:Mossadegh Trial 28 Amordad 1332.jpg|thumb|Mohammad Mosaddegh in court, 8 November 1953.]]
Many supporters of Iran continued to fight against the new regime, yet they were suppressed with some even being killed. The political party that Mossadegh founded, the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front of Iran]], was later reorganized by [[Karim Sanjabi]], and is currently being led by the [[List of national poets|National Poet]] of Iran [[Adib Boroumand]], who was a strong Mossadegh supporter and helped spread pro-Mossadegh propaganda during the Abadan Crisis and its aftermath.&lt;ref name="adibboroumand.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.adibboroumand.com/biography/|title=Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Communist Tudeh, however, bore the main brunt of the crackdown.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, 1999, p. 84"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_mnrYNIVfCgC&amp;pg=PA92|title=Tortured Confessions |publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|page=84|isbn=978-0-520-21866-6|access-date=18 March 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shah's security forces arrested 4,121 Tudeh political activists including 386 civil servants, 201 college students, 165 teachers, 125 skilled workers, 80 textile workers, and 60 cobblers.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Ervand 1999, p. 89"&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'', (University of California), 1999, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Forty were executed (primarily for murder, such as [[Khosro Roozbeh|Khosrow Roozbeh]]),&lt;ref name="Milani Persians" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; another 14 died under torture and over 200 were sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The Shah's post-coup dragnet also captured 477 Tudeh members ("22 colonels, 69 majors, 100 captains, 193 lieutenants, 19 noncommissioned officers, and 63 military cadets") who were in the Iranian armed forces.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, 1999, p. 92" /&gt; After their presence was revealed, some National Front supporters complained that this Communist Tudeh military network could have saved Mosaddegh. However, few Tudeh officers commanded powerful field units, especially tank divisions that might have countered the coup. Most of the captured Tudeh officers came from the military academies, police and medical corps.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, 1999, p. 92"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mnrYNIVfCgC&amp;pg=PA92|title=Tortured Confessions |publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|page=92|isbn=978-0-520-21866-6|access-date=18 March 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Iran Between Two Revolutions'', 1982, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; At least eleven of the captured army officers were tortured to death between 1953 and 1958.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Ervand 1999, p. 89" /&gt; Nevertheless, the Shah's response was exceedingly mild compared to the typical reaction that the future Islamic Republic would usually give to its opponents, or even other contemporary autocracies.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Laqueur |first=Walter Z. |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/why-the-shah-fell/ |title=Why the Shah Fell |publisher=Commentary Magazine |date=3 January 1979 |access-date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahamian Confessions"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|title=Tortured Confessions|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tortured_Confessions.html?id=ucTdH9sh1O0C|isbn=9780520922907|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahamian M"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|title=The Iranian Mojahedin|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Iranian_Mojahedin.html?id=jqTzo8N-dyEC|isbn=9780300052671|date=1992-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iran Tribunal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran Tribunal|url=http://www.irantribunal.com/index.php/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HosseinFatemi.jpg|thumb|Hossein Fatemi after arrest]]
After the 1953 coup, the Shah's government formed the [[SAVAK]] (secret police), many of whose agents were trained in the United States. The SAVAK monitored dissidents, and carried out censorship. After the 1971 [[Siahkal incident|Siahkal Incident]], it was given a "loose leash" to torture suspected dissidents with "brute force" that, over the years, "increased dramatically", and nearly 100 people were executed for political reasons during the last 20 years of the Shah's rule.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian Confessions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions'', (University of California), 1999, pp. 88, 105&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Shah generally dealt with dissent in a relatively mild manner compared to most autocratic leaders.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="commentarymagazine.com" /&gt; After the revolution, SAVAK was officially abolished, but was in reality "drastically expanded" into a [[VEVAK|new organization]] that killed over 8,000–12,000 prisoners between 1981–1985 alone, and 20,000–30,000 in total, with one prisoner who served time under both the Shah and the Islamic Republic declaring that "four months under (Islamic Republic's) warden [[Asadollah Lajevardi]] took the toll of four years under SAVAK".&lt;ref name="Abrahamian Confessions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahamian M" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Iran Tribunal" /&gt;

Another effect was sharp improvement of Iran's economy; the British-led oil embargo against Iran ended, and oil revenue increased significantly beyond the pre-nationalisation level. Despite Iran not controlling its national oil, the Shah agreed to replacing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company with a consortium—British Petroleum and eight European and American oil companies; in result, oil revenues increased from $34&amp;nbsp;million in 1954–1955 to $181&amp;nbsp;million in 1956–1957, and continued increasing,&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Iran between Revolutions'', (Princeton University Press, 1982), pp. 419–20&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States sent development aid and advisers. The Shah's government attempted to solve the issue of oil nationalization through this method, and Iran began to develop rapidly under his rule. The Shah later in his memoirs declared that Mossadegh was a "dictator" that was "damaging" Iran through his "stubbornness", while he (the Shah) "followed" the smarter option.&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt; By the 1970s, Iran was wealthier than all of its surrounding neighbors, and economists frequently predicted that it would become a major global economic power, and a [[developed country]].&lt;ref name="Milani Shah" /&gt;

===Internationally===
Kinzer wrote that the 1953 coup d'état was the first time the United States used the CIA to overthrow a democratically elected, civil government.&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt; The Eisenhower administration viewed Operation Ajax as a success, with "immediate and far-reaching effect. Overnight, the CIA became a central part of the American foreign policy apparatus, and covert action came to be regarded as a cheap and effective way to shape the course of world events"—a coup engineered by the CIA called [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|Operation PBSUCCESS]] toppling the duly elected [[Guatemala]]n government of [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]], which had nationalised farm land owned by the [[United Fruit Company]], followed the next year.&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|209}}

A pro-American government in Iran doubled the United States' geographic and strategic advantage in the Middle East, as [[Turkey]], also bordering the USSR, was part of [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2002/02-february/e0218a.htm|title=Turkey joined NATO in 1952.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, U.S. Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright|Madeleine K. Albright]], acknowledged the coup's pivotal role in the troubled relationship and "came closer to apologizing than any American official ever has before".

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Eisenhower administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons. ... But the coup was clearly a setback for Iran's political development. And it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America in their internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/coup53/coup53p1.php |title=A short account of 1953 Coup |publisher=Iranchamber.com |date= |access-date=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastinfo.com/documents/iranspeech.htm|title=Secretary Albright's Speech regarding Iran|work=MidEast Info|date=17 March 2000|access-date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/policy/strategic-challenges/us-asia/us-iran-relations?page=0,0|title=US-Iran Relations |work=Asia Society|date=17 March 2000|access-date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2009, the U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] [[A New Beginning|in a speech]] in [[Cairo]], Egypt, talked about the United States' relationship with Iran, mentioning the role of the U.S. in 1953 Iranian coup saying:

{{quote|This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is indeed a tumultuous history between us. In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I have made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/04/barack-obama-keynote-speech-egypt|title=Barack Obama's Cairo speech|work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=5 June 2009 | date=4 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090611192419/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/04/barack-obama-keynote-speech-egypt| archivedate= 11 June 2009 &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED AUTHOR --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
In the Islamic Republic, remembrance of the coup is quite different from that of history books published in the West, and follows the precepts of Ayatollah Khomeini that Islamic jurists must guide the country to prevent "the influence of foreign powers".&lt;ref&gt;Hamid Algar's book, ''Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations of Imam Khomeini'', ed by Hamid Algar, Mizan, 1981, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Kashani came out against Mosaddegh by mid-1953 and "told a foreign correspondent that Mosaddegh had fallen because he had forgotten that the shah enjoyed extensive popular support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abrahamian |first=Ervand |title=Khomeinism : Essays on the Islamic Republic |publisher=University of California Press |year=1993 |page=109 |isbn=978-0520081734 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Kashani "went even further and declared that Mosaddegh deserved to be executed because he had committed the ultimate offense: rebelling against the shah, 'betraying' the country, and repeatedly violating the sacred law."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by {{cite book |first=Y. |last=Richard |chapter=Ayatollah Kashani: Precursor of the Islamic Republic? |title=Religion and Politics in Iran |editor-first=N. |editor-last=Keddie |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1983 |page=109 |isbn=978-0300028744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men associated with Mossadegh and his ideals dominated Iran's first post-revolutionary government. The first prime minister after the Iranian revolution was [[Mehdi Bazargan]], a close associate of Mossadegh. But with the subsequent rift between the conservative Islamic establishment and the secular liberal forces, Mossadegh's work and legacy has been largely ignored by the Islamic Republic establishment.&lt;ref name="Kinzer" /&gt;{{Rp|258}} However, Mosaddegh remains a popular historical figure among Iranian opposition factions. Mosaddegh's image is one of the symbols of Iran's opposition movement, also known as the [[Iranian Green Movement|Green Movement]].&lt;ref name="Kinzer Guardian 2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jun/19/iran-protests-mousavi-mossadeq|title=Democracy, made in Iran|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|date=22 June 2009|work=The Guardian |location=UK|access-date=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinzer writes that Mosaddegh "for most Iranians" is "the most vivid symbol of Iran's long struggle for democracy" and that modern protesters carrying a picture of Mosaddegh is the equivalent of saying "We want democracy" and "No foreign intervention".&lt;ref name="Kinzer Guardian 2009" /&gt;

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kinzer's book ''[[All the Shah's Men]]: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror'' has been censored of descriptions of [[Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani]]'s activities during the Anglo-American coup d'état. Mahmood Kashani, the son of Abol-Ghasem Kashani, "one of the top members of the current, ruling élite"&lt;ref name=Kazemzadeh2004 /&gt; whom the Iranian [[Council of Guardians]] has twice approved to run for the presidency, denies there was a coup d'état in 1953, saying Mosaddegh was obeying British plans to undermine the role of [[Shia]] clerics.&lt;ref name=Kazemzadeh2004&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review Essay of Stephen Kinzer's ''All the Shah's Men'' |first=Masoud |last=Kazemzadeh |journal=Middle East Policy |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=2004 |pages=122–52 |doi=10.1111/j.1061-1924.2004.00182.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This allegation also is posited in the book ''Khaterat-e Arteshbod-e Baznesheshteh Hossein Fardoust'' (The Memoirs of Retired General Hossein Fardoust), published in the Islamic Republic and allegedly written by [[Hossein Fardoust]], a former [[SAVAK]] officer. It says that rather than being a mortal enemy of the British, Mohammad Mosaddegh always favored them, and his nationalisation campaign of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was inspired by "the British themselves". Scholar [[Ervand Abrahamian]] suggests that the fact that Fardoust's death was announced before publication of the book may be significant, as the Islamic Republic authorities may have forced him into writing such statements under duress.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian, Ervand 1999 pp. 160–61"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tortured Confessions|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0520218666|pages=160–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 17 March 1978 at around 21:20 a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) unit and a [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) unit became engaged in a shoot out in a field in [[Lisnamuck, Maghera civil parish|Lisnamuck]], near [[Maghera]], [[County Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Urban - Big Boys Rules: The SAS and the Secret Struggle against the IRA, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the PIRA unit was [[Francis Hughes]] who was from [[Bellaghy]], County Londonderry, who at that time was the "most wanted man" in Northern Ireland when a year earlier on 18 April 1977, Hughes, [[Dominic McGlinchey]] and  [[Ian Milne]] were travelling in a car near the town of [[Moneymore]] when an RUC patrol car carrying four officers signalled them to stop.&lt;ref name="ttm1"&gt;''The Trigger Men'', pp. 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tmd2"&gt;''Ten Men Dead'', p. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA members attempted to escape by performing a [[u-turn]], but lost control of the car which ended up in a ditch.&lt;ref name="ttm1" /&gt; They abandoned the car and opened fire on the RUC patrol car, killing two officers and wounding another, before running off through fields.&lt;ref name="ttm1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tmd2" /&gt; A second RUC patrol came under fire while attempting to prevent the men fleeing, and despite a search operation by the RUC and [[British Army]] (BA) the IRA members escaped.&lt;ref name="tmd2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=8&amp;month=04&amp;year=1977|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shoot-out occurred on St. Patricks night 1978. [[Lance Corporal]] David Jones and another soldier were in an OP near the Glenshane Pass area. At around 21:15 the troops saw two IRA volunteers wearing military style camouflage style clothing. One of the British troops apparently saw the word "Ireland" sewn on to one of the IRA volunteers clothing. Lance Corporal Jones stood up believing they might be a unit of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] and shouted at the men asking them what they were doing. The two IRA volunteers opened fire on the British troops. In the gun battle that ensued, Lance Corporal Jones was killed and another SAS man wounded, while Francis Hughes was badly injured and captured in a nearby field the next morning, the other IRA volunteer escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paradata.org.uk/people/david-jones|title=David  Jones  {{!}} ParaData|website=paradata.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=17&amp;month=03&amp;year=1978|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|last=Sutton|first=Malcolm|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch78.htm#17378|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1978|last=Melaugh|first=Dr Martin|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Sarakhsi was killed by Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] because, according to an anecdote preserved in [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]]'s ''Mu'jam al-Udaba''', he had urged the caliph towards apostasy. [[Al-Biruni]] reports in his ''Chronology'' that al-Sarakhsi had written books in which he denounced prophecy and ridiculed the prophets, whom he styled charlatans. However, Rosenthal has disputed the historicity of the stories that claim al-Sarakhsi was executed for heretical beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKinney|first=Robert C.|title=The case of rhyme versus reason: Ibn al-Rūmī and his poetics in context|year=2004|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=90-04-13010-1|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al Salam Palace''' is a historic palace and museum in [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=ssh/&gt; 

==History==
The original landmark palace was built in the 1960s to accommodate visiting heads of state.&lt;ref name="ssh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sshic.com/projects/al-salam-palace|title=Al Salam Palace|date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the palace was severely damaged during the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi invasion]] and thought by many to be beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Palace Museum|url=http://www.sshic.com/projects/al-salam-palace}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palace is part of the new [[Kuwait National Cultural District]] (KNCD).&lt;ref name="kncd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeminternational.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kuwait-Museums-Director-Candidate-Briefing-Document.pdf|title=Kuwait National Cultural District Museums Director|date=28 August 2017|access-date=2017-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829074330/http://aeminternational.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kuwait-Museums-Director-Candidate-Briefing-Document.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait National Cultural District|url=http://www.alshaheedparkmuseums.com/about/kncd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The palace will reopen as a [[museum]] dedicated to the [[history of Kuwait]] told through its 15 rulers.&lt;ref name=ssh/&gt; The design will retain the palace’s original character while incorporating contemporary additions and meeting the highest international construction standards.&lt;ref name=ssh/&gt; Visitors will follow in the footsteps of heads of state and VIPs, arriving in the Rotunda, the heart of the original palace, before beginning a journey through nine recreated palatial rooms and galleries. The new palace will border the new [[Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre]] and be part of Kuwait’s new cultural landscape.&lt;ref name=ssh/&gt; 

Al Salam Palace consists of:&lt;ref name=ssh/&gt; 

* Museum to tell the history of Kuwait through the story of its rulers
* Visitor Centre
* Palace Garden

'''Anton Christian Bang''' (18 September 1840 in [[Dønna]], [[Helgeland]]&amp;nbsp;– 29 December 1913) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] theologian, historian and politician for the [[Conservative Party of Norway]].
Bang was one of the more prominent figures within the [[Church of Norway]] in the decades around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uio.no/uhs/sok/fag/teologi/tfutstilling/bang.htm ''Anton Christian Bang'' (From Hersleb to Dahl)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610064046/http://www.ub.uio.no/uhs/sok/fag/teologi/tfutstilling/bang.htm |date=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Professor of [[church history]] at the [[Royal Frederick University]] from 1885, as [[Minister of Culture and Church Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Education and Church Affairs]] 1893–1895 and as [[Bishop of Oslo]] 1896-1912.

==Biography==
Bang was born on the island [[Dønna]], in [[Nordland]] to Ivar Christian Bang Andersen and Mariane Hansdatter Klæboe. As a youth he was involved in the [[Lofoten]] fishing season. He attended teacher seminar in [[Tromsø]] (1858-1960), theology studies (1862-1867) and then ministry in [[Gran, Norway|Gran]], in [[Tromsø]] and at [[Gaustad]] asylum in [[Oslo|Christiania]]. In 1876 he took the first doctorate in theology at the [[University of Oslo]] on the subject ''Om Kristi Opstandelses historiske Virkelighed'' (On Christ's Resurrection's Historical Reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://snl.no/Anton_Christian_Bang

Bang was a professor of church history (1885) and [[Bishop of Oslo]] (1896-1912). As a Bishop in Oslo and with his close ties to the royal house, he represented several national missions, including at the inauguration of the German Redemption Church in [[Jerusalem]] 1898.

Bang was [[Minister of Culture and Church Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Education and Church Affairs]] 1893–1895, and member of the Council of State Division in [[Stockholm]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/smk/ryddemappe/kan-ikke-plasseres/smk/english/government/previous_gov/III-Persons-1814-.html?id=414750 |title=Det norske statsråd 1814-: III Personer 1814- |publisher=Government.no |accessdate=2009-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521083639/http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/smk/ryddemappe/kan-ikke-plasseres/smk/english/government/previous_gov/III-Persons-1814-.html?id=414750 |archivedate=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bang was appointed to the [[Second cabinet Stang|Second cabinet]] of [[Emil Stang]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/governments/dissolution-of-the-danish-norwegian-real/governments-1814---1905/emil-stangs-second-government-1893---189.html?id=507075|title=Emil Stang's Second Government|publisher=Government.no|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a researcher Bang was very productive and his writings cover a wide field.  Bang wrote several major works in his career, including a notable biography on [[Hans Nielsen Hauge]]. The main contribution he made was as a collector on historic information and thus gave important contribution to the religious folklore research. He  was considered a conservative, both as a politician and as a theologian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://nbl.snl.no/Anton_Christian_Bang

{{Arameans}}
'''Aram''' is a region mentioned in the Bible located in present-day central [[Syria]], including where the city of [[Aleppo]] now stands. At its height, Aram stretched from the Lebanon mountains eastward across the [[Euphrates]], including parts of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] valley in northwestern [[Mesopotamia]] on the border of [[Assyria]]. The region was known as ''The Land of the Amurru'' during the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335-2154 BC), [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (2112-2004 BC) and [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (2025-1750 BC) in reference to its largely [[Amorite]] inhabitants. During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BC), [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (612-539 BC) and [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539-332 BC) Aram was known as [[Eber-Nari]].

== Etymology ==
The etymology might be connected with the harami, arami, aramija or ahlamu, meaning "bandits". One standard explanation is an original meaning of "highlands". This has been interpreted to be in contrast with [[Canaan]], or "lowlands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25LVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=Tristram+Bible+Places&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjajYijhfnYAhVMoVMKHcy_D8YQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Tristram%20Bible%20Places&amp;f=false|title=Bible Places: Or, the Topography of the Holy Land, a Succinct Account of All the Places, Rivers, and Mountains of the Land of Israel, Mentioned in the Bible, So Far as They Have Been Identified : Together with Their Modern Names and Historical References|first=H. B.|last=Tristram|date=1884|publisher=Gorgias Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early references ==
[[Judeo-Christian]] tradition claims the name is derived from the biblical [[Aram, son of Shem]], a grandson of [[Noah]] in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:22&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name Aram can be found from many ancient sources. The [[toponym]] ''A-ra-mu'' appears in an inscription at the [[East Semitic]] speaking kingdom [[Ebla]] listing geographical names, and the term ''Armi'', which is the [[Eblaite language|Eblaite]] term for nearby [[Aleppo]], occurs frequently in the [[Ebla tablets]] (c. 2300 BC). One of the annals of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]] (c. 2250 BC) mentions that he captured "Dubul, the [[Ensí|ensi]] of ''A-ra-me''" (''Arame'' is seemingly a [[genitive]] form), in the course of a campaign against [[Simurrum]] in the northern mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/yearnames/HTML/T2K3.htm|title=T2K3.htm|work=ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early references to a place or people of "Aram" have appeared at the archives of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (c. 1900 BC) and at [[Ugarit]] (c. 1300 BC).

There is little agreement concerning what, if any, relationship there was between the places or proof that the Aramu were actually Aramaeans. The earliest ''undisputed'' mention of [[Aramaeans]] as a people is in the inscriptions of the [[Assyria]]n king [[Tiglath Pileser I]] (1114–1076 BC) during the latter part of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref name=Lipinskip25&gt;Lipinski, 2000, p. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the Aramaean territories located within Aram are also referenced in the Hebrew Bible. They include [[Aram-Naharaim]], [[Paddan-Aram]], [[Aram-Damascus]], [[Aram-Rehob]], and Aram-[[Zobah]].

== History ==
The [[Arameans]] appear to have displaced the earlier Semitic [[Amorite]] populations of ancient Syria during the period from 1100 BC to 900 BC, which was a [[Greek Dark Ages|dark age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

The Arameans emerged in a region which was largely under the domination of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1050 BC), and soon after appearing they were conquered by [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115- 1077 BC) of [[Assyria]], and were incorporated into the Middle Assyrian Empire which encompassed much of the [[Near East]] and [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref name="Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq"&gt;Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Assyria fell into a temporary decline from the second half of the 11th century BC until the latter part of the 10th century BC, allowing the Arameans to establish a string of states across the Levant. During the period 1050 – 900 BC Arameans came to dominate most of what is now Syria but was then called [[Eber-Nari]] and [[Aramea]].

Two medium-sized [[Aramaeans|Aramaean]] kingdoms, [[Aram-Damascus]] and [[Hamath]], along with several smaller kingdoms and independent city-states, developed in the region during the early first millennium BCE. The most notable of these were [[Bit Adini]], [[Bit Bahiani]], [[Bit Hadipe]], [[Aram-Rehob]], [[Aram-Zobah]], [[Bit-Zamani]], [[Bit-Halupe]] and [[Maacah|Aram-Ma'akah]], as well as the Aramean tribal polities of the [[Gambulu]], [[Litau]] and [[Puqudu]].

There was some synthesis with neo [[Neo-Hittite|Hittite]] populations in northern [[Syria]] and south central [[Anatolia]], and a number of small so called [[Syro-Hittite states]] arose in the region, such as [[Tabal]]. The east [[Mediterranean]] coast was largely dominated by [[Phoenicia]]n city states such as [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Berytus]] and [[Arvad]].

With the advent of the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BC) however, the region once more fell fully under the control of Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palacios|first=Isaac Asimov ; maps by Rafael|title=Asimov's guide to the Bible : the Old and New Testaments|year=1981|publisher=Wings Books|location=New York|isbn=0-517-34582-X|page=54|edition=Reprint [der Ausg.] in 2 vol. 1968–1969.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of people living there were deported into Assyria, [[Babylonia]] and elsewhere. A few ''[[stele]]s'' that name kings of this period have been found, such as the 8th-century [[Zakkur stele]]. The Assyrians and Babylonians themselves adopted a Mesopotamian form of Aramaic, known as [[Imperial Aramaic]] in the 8th century BC, when [[Tiglath-pileser III]] made it the [[lingua franca]] of his vast empire. The [[Neo Aramaic]] dialects still spoken by the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Mandeans]] of northern Iraq, south east Turkey, north east Syria and north west Iran, descend from this language.

The Neo Assyrian Empire was riven by unremitting civil war from 626 BC onwards, weakening it severely, and allowing it to be attacked and destroyed by a coalition of its former vassals between 616 and 605 BC, although remnants of the Assyrian military and administration may have clung on in some northern regions until 599 BC.&lt;ref&gt;^ Assyria 1995: Proceedings of the 10th Anniversary Symposium of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project / Helsinki, September 7–11, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The region was subsequently fought over by the [[Babylonians]] and [[Egyptians]], the latter of whom had belatedly come to the aid of their former Assyrian overlords. The Babylonians prevailed and Aram became a part of the short lived [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (612-539 BC) where it remained named [[Eber-Nari]].

The [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539-332 BC) overthrew the Babylonians and conquered the region. They retained the Imperial Aramaic introduced by the Assyrians, and the name of Eber-Nari.

In 332 BC the region was conquered by the [[Greeks|Greek]] ruler, [[Alexander the Great]]. Upon his death in 323 BC this area became part of the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire]], at which point Greek replaced the Assyrian introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the official language of Empire, as were the names [[Eber-Nari]] and Aramea. This area and other parts of the former Assyrian Empire to the east (including Assyria itself) were renamed [[Syria]] ([[Seleucid Syria]]), a 9th-century BC [[Hurrian]], [[Luwian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] corruption of Assyria (see [[Etymology of Syria]] and [[Name of Syria]]), which had for centuries until this point referred specifically to the land of [[Assyria]] and the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], which in modern terms actually covered the northern half of [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]], south east [[Turkey]] and the north western fringes of [[Iran]], and not the bulk of ''modern Syria'' and [[Lebanon]] and its largely [[Aramean]] and [[Phoenicia]]n inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf |title=The Terms "Assyria" and "Syria" Again|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110613170304/http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf| archivedate= 13 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this period that the later [[Name of Syria|''Syria vs Assyria'' naming controversy]] arises, the Seleucids confusingly applied the name not only to the [[Mesopotamian]] land of Assyria itself, but also to the lands west of [[Euphrates]] which had never been part of Assyria itself, but merely Aramean, Phoenician, [[Neo-Hittite]] and [[Sutean]] inhabited colonies. When they lost control of Assyria itself to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], the name ''Syria'' survived but was dislocated from its original source, and was applied only to the land west of [[Euphrates]] that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, while Assyria-proper went back to being called Assyria (and also [[Athura]]/[[Assuristan]]). However, this situation led to both Assyrians and Arameans being dubbed ''Syrians'' and later ''Syriacs'' in [[Greco-Roman]] culture.
This area, by now called ''Syria'', was fought over by [[Seleucids]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] during the 2nd century BC, and later still by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Sassanid]] [[Persian people|Persians]]. [[Palmyra]], a powerful [[Aramean]] kingdom arose during this period,
and for a time it dominated the area and successfully resisted Roman and Persian attempts at conquest.&lt;ref name="Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq" /&gt; The region eventually came under the control of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Christianity]] began to take hold from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD, and the Aramaic language gradually supplanted [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] in [[Phoenecia]] and [[Hebrew]] in [[Israel]] (the Roman [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]).

In the mid-7th century AD the region fell to the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest. The [[Aramaic]] language survived among a sizable portion of the population of Syria, who resisted ''Arabization''. However, the native [[Western Aramaic]] of the Aramean Christian population of Syria is spoken today by only a few thousand people, the majority having now adopted the [[Arabic]] language. [[Mesopotamian]] [[Eastern Aramaic]], which still contains a number of loan words from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] language, as well as structural similarities, still survives among the majority of ethnically distinct [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], who are mainly based in northern [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]], south east [[Turkey]] and north west [[Iran]].

The '''Battle of Dong Dang''' was the initial phase of the [[Battle of Lang Son (1979)|Battle of Lang Son]] during the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]], taking place in the town of [[Đồng Đăng]] and vicinal positions between 17–23 February 1979.

==Battle==
The Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) began their operations at 05:00 on 17 February&lt;ref name="ODowd79"/&gt; with a barrage of more than 6,000 [[artillery]] shells pounding on Vietnamese strongpoints and gun positions.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chinese had paved the way for their offensive throughout the night before by infiltrating the Vietnamese territory, cutting telephone lines and conducting sabotages.&lt;ref name="ODowd79"&gt;O'Dowd, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Waves of PLA troops from the 55th Army quickly overwhelmed Hill 386, a position situated 1.5&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;km south of the border, killing 118 Vietnamese soldiers.&lt;ref name="ODowd80"/&gt; Though pockets of resistance were continued near the [[Friendship Pass]] and in Đồng Đăng, most of the Vietnamese defense was by then undertaken by the [[Vietnam People's Army]] (VPA) 12th Regiment southerly in the area around the [[hamlet]] of Thâm Mô.&lt;ref name="ODowd80"&gt;O'Dowd, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The hamlet was situated on a low hill nearby the intersection of Highways 4A and 1B and [[Lạng Sơn]]–[[Nanning]] railroad, with Hills 423 and 505 in the east and Hill 339 in the west. The headquarters of the 12th Regiment was set up on Hill 438, located 1,000 m to the west of Hill 339.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dowd, p. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Between Thâm Mô and Hill 339 was the French Fort, a large fortification supported by 1.5-meter-thick concrete wall lying on a hill to the southwest of Đồng Đăng. The fort, together with Thâm Mô and Hill 339, created a triangular mutually-supporting defensive structure, which was able to provide fire suppression against any attack on Đồng Đăng.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, p. 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking Hill 386, the PLA 163rd Division was tasked with capturing Đồng Đăng, as well as striking Thâm Mô and Hills 339, 423, and 505.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dowd, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was backed by small groups of [[tank]]s arriving on Highway 4A.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dowd, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; These initial assaults were thwarted with heavy losses, which included nearly half of the tanks supporting the PLA 163rd Division.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The PLA responded by conducting two enveloping thrusts on the flanks of the Thâm Mô perimeter; one was carried out by Unit 33980 of the [[54th Army (People's Republic of China)|54th Army]] to the east of Thâm Mô on the village of Thâm Lũng, and another was on Cồn Khoang, a position in the rear of Hill 339.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dowd, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese movement against Cồn Khoang was ambushed by the VPA 63rd Company at about 09:00 with an additional Vietnamese platoon moving in behind the enemy to block their retreatment, resulting in the decimation of one Chinese [[battalion]].&lt;ref name="ODowd82"/&gt; At Thâm Lũng, Chinese launched massed attacks on several surrounding hills, which were stiffly contained by the defenders. On 18 February, a Vietnamese counter-attack launched by the VPA 2nd Regiment drove PLA units back to their assemble positions on Hills 409, 611, and 675; this pattern was repeated on the following days. On 23 February, the PLA stormed Phai Môn, a position to the east of Thâm Lũng, using six waves of attacks, of which all were rebuffed. Chinese forces had to launch twelve more charges throughout the day to finally break through Thâm Lũng.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dowd, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Thâm Mô area, Chinese charges in mass formations had been continuously repulsed with heavy casualties. The Chinese field commanders had to switch their tactics, using small-unit attacks to flank Vietnamese positions instead of frontal attacks by human waves.&lt;ref name="ODowd82"&gt;O'Dowd, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening of 19 February, the PLA launched a new wave of attacks against the Thâm Mô line, committing one company to the French Fort, one battalion to Thâm Mô and another to Hill 339. The Vietnamese forces, again, successfully held on their positions and fought off the assaults, taking a high toll on the attackers. Half of the Chinese company from the 489th Regiment assigned to capture the French Fort were lost in the assault.&lt;ref name="Zhang98"&gt;Zhang, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February, after receiving reinforcements, Chinese troops renewed their attack on the French Fort, securing most of the ground around it in a four-hour engagement. After unsuccessful attempts to negotiate, the Chinese then used gasoline, explosives, and flamethrowers to demolish the fort, killing approximately 800 Vietnamese soldiers and civilians sheltering inside.&lt;ref name="Zhang98"/&gt; At 20:00 on 22 February, Thâm Mô finally fell to the hands of the PLA 163rd Division.&lt;ref name="ODowd82"/&gt;

A Vietnamese veteran named Nguyễn Duy Thực told that one of his comrades told him that he saw behind a Chinese battalion was marching into the town of Dong Dang was a  partisans team followed to support. They entered every houses to catch chickens, catch pigs, down the lakes to catch fish ... These troops set up explosives and destroyed every civilians houses. On the way back to the French fort, his comrades found and shot some Chinese soldiers. As he ran through the bodies, he saw a dead Chinese in a two-handed pose holding a bag of sweet potatoes.&lt;ref name="vtcnews"&gt;vtc.vn, "[https://vtc.vn/ky-uc-1721979-chuyen-cua-nguoi-linh-song-sot-o-phao-dai-tu-thu-dong-dang-d194910.html"],"Trong pháo đài lúc đó có khoảng 700 con người, bao gồm Đại đội 42, một đơn vị cảnh sát dã chiến Đồng Đăng, công an vũ trang, cùng một số người dân chạy loạn tìm lên.(VTCNews, 16/2/2015)."&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February, Chinese forces eventually captured the town of Đồng Đăng.&lt;ref name="Zhang99"&gt;Zhang, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, from many scene videos were taken from this brutally battle, Vietnamese director Vũ Hải Ninh made a war movie named "Đất Mẹ" (The Motherland) to show this harsh war front and to boost the [[Vietnamese nationalism]].&lt;ref name="vnexpress.vn"&gt;vnexpress.vn, "[https://giaitri.vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/phim/diem-phim/cac-phim-dien-anh-lay-boi-canh-chien-tranh-bien-gioi-1979-3542706.html"],""Đất mẹ" - Hải Ninh.

He was born at [[Arezzo]] in [[Tuscany]], of a prominent family, several members of which were distinguished like himself for their attainments in law.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Accolti, Benedetto|volume=1|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was for some time professor of law in the [[University of Florence]], and after the dismissal in 1456 from the [[Chancellor of Florence|Florentine chancellorship]] of the renowned humanist [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini|Poggio Bracciolini]] for incompetence and an interregnum of two years, Accolti himself became [[Chancellor]] of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine Republic]] in 1458.

Accolti's memory was prodigious. Having, one day, heard a speech delivered by an ambassador from the king of Hungary to the [[Signoria of Florence|Florentine government]], he afterwards repeated it, word for word.

Accolti wrote in [[Latin]] a history of the [[First Crusade]], entitled ''De Bello a Christianis contra Barbaros gesto pro Christi Sepulchro et Judaea recuperandis libri IV'' (1464), or "On the War carried on by the Christians against the Barbarians, for the Recovery of Christ's Sepulchre, and of Judea", which is said to have furnished [[Torquato Tasso]] with the historical basis for his ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]''.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"/&gt; Another work of Accolti's, a "Dialogue" (1461–63), was published at [[Parma]] in 1689; in this work the author compares the achievements of the moderns to the ancients, in order to prove that the former are in no respect inferior to the latter.  Both works were dedicated to members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]], the "Dialogue" to [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo]] "il vecchio", the history to his son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]].

Accolti's younger brother [[Francesco Accolti|Francesco]] was also a distinguished jurist.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"/&gt; His son [[Pietro Accolti|Pietro]] became a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], while another son [[Bernardo Accolti|Bernardo]] was a notable vernacular poet. [[Benedetto Accolti the Younger]], the chancellor's grandson, also became a cardinal.

'''bya''' or '''b.y.a.''' is an [[abbreviation]] for "'''[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years ago'''". It is commonly used as a [[unit of time]] to denote length of time before the present in 10&lt;SUP&gt;9&lt;/SUP&gt; years. This [[Acronym#Nomenclature|initialism]] is often used in the sciences of [[astronomy]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]].

The "billion" in bya is the 10&lt;SUP&gt;9&lt;/SUP&gt; "billion" of the [[Long and short scales|short scale]] of the [[United States|U.S.]],&lt;ref name="Gale2009"&gt;Gale, Joseph (2009). ''Astrobiology of Earth: The Emergence''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=64zn0nxDVUYC&amp;pg=PA21 21.]&lt;/ref&gt; not the long-scale 10&lt;SUP&gt;12&lt;/SUP&gt; "billion" of some [[Europe]]an usage. Billion by this convention (10&lt;SUP&gt;9&lt;/SUP&gt;) is often called a "thousand million" in the UK and a "milliard" in some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Chartrand, Mark (2004). ''Satellite Communications for the Nonspecialist''. New York: SPIE Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MM0d2cMUWbEC&amp;pg=PA73 73.]&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, there is potential for some confusion, and some scientists prefer the unit [[Gya]], while others prefer [[Giga-annum|Ga]] (Giga-annum), however bya remains in more widespread use.&lt;ref name="Gale2009"/&gt; In 1974, the UK switched from the long scale to the short scale.&lt;ref name="Gale2009"/&gt;

Related units are [[Mya (unit)|mya]] ("million years ago"), and '''byr''' ("billion years"). These are traditionally written in [[lowercase]].  [[Giga-annum|Ga]] or Gya has a [[capitalization|capitalized]] first letter instead.

The '''Calmecac''' ("the house of the lineage", {{IPA-nah|kalˈmekak||}}) was a school for the sons of [[Aztec]] nobility (''[[Pipiltin|pīpiltin]]'' {{IPA-nah|piːˈpiɬtin||}}) in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic period]] of [[Mesoamerica]]n history, where they would receive rigorous religious and military training. The two main primary sources for information on the ''calmecac'' and ''telpochcalli'' are in [[Bernardino de Sahagún]]'s [[Florentine Codex]] of the ''General History of the Things of New Spain'' (Books III, VI, and VIII) and part 3 of the [[Codex Mendoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Calneck, "The Calmecac and Telpochcalli in Pre-Conquest Tenochtitlan," in ''The Work of Bernardino de Sahagún: Pioneer Ethnographer of Sixteenth-Century Aztec Mexico'', J. Jorge Klor de Alva et al., eds.  Albany: SUNY Albany Institute for Mesoamerican Studies 1988, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the calmecac has been characterized as for elites only, Sahagun's account says that at times commoners, [[macehualtin]] were assigned to the calmecac as well and trained for the priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Calneck, "The Calmecac and Telpochcalli" p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tēlpochcalli]] ({{IPA-nah|teːɬpot͡ʃˈkalːi||}} "house of youth") was where mostly commoners and some noble youths received military training, but would have been precluded from the higher ranks of power.&lt;ref&gt;Calnek, "Calmecac and Telpochcalli", p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Codex Mendoza's account of the calmecac emphasizes the possibilities of upward mobility for young commoner men, (''macehualtin''), educated in the telpochcalli. The placement of a noble youth in the telpochcalli might have been by lesser wives' or concubines' sons or younger sons, perhaps of commoner status, so that the boys did not have to compete with noble youths in the calmecac.&lt;ref&gt;Calnek, "Calmecac and Telpochcalli", p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  Codex Mendoza's account largely ignores class distinctions between the two institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Calnek, "Calmecac and Telpochcalli", p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calmecac of the Aztec capital, [[Tenochtitlan]], was located in the ceremonial center of the city and it was dedicated to [[Quetzalcoatl]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''calmecac'' was the students' home for the duration of their training, and they would enter the school as young as five to seven years of age. The students received instruction in songs, rituals, reading and writing, the [[Aztec calendar|calendar]] (''[[tonalpohualli|tōnalpōhualli]]'' {{IPA-nah|toːnaɬpoːˈwalːi||}}) and all the basic training which was also taught in the telpochcalli.

Students commenced formal military training around age fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Promising sons of nobles would be trained especially by the military orders of the [[Jaguar warriors]] (''ōcēlōmeh'' {{IPA-nah|oːseːˈloːmeʔ||}}) or [[Eagle warrior]]s (''cuāuhtin'' {{IPA-nah|ˈkʷaːʍtin||}}) in their quarters, the ''cuāuhcalli'' ({{IPA-nah|kʷaːʍˈkalːi||}}).&lt;ref&gt;Hassig (1988), p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chittadhar Hridaya''' ([[Devanagari]]: चित्तधर हृदय) (born '''Chittadhar Tuladhar''') (19 May 1906 – 9 June 1982) was a Nepalese poet. He is regarded as one of the greatest literary figures from [[Nepal]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/9780195341829/toc.html|title=Sugata Saurabha: An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya |publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online|accessdate=1 March 2011|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of Kavi Keshari (Lion among Poets) was conferred on him by King [[Mahendra of Nepal]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sthapit |first=Arhan |title=Oxford publishes Nepali epic in English |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=31294&amp;cat_id=4|accessdate=28 February 2011|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote primarily in [[Nepal Bhasa]] but has created works in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Hindi]] too.

Hridaya dedicated his life to serving his mother tongue, rejecting a flourishing ancestral business and suffering imprisonment by an autocratic government. In 1941, he was jailed for five years by the [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] regime for writing a poem in Nepal Bhasa in a crackdown against the language.

The family owned a business house in [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turin|first=Mark|title=Lovesick, homesick or simply sick of Tibet|url=http://www.nepalitimes.com/issue/2002/09/20/Review/5812|accessdate=1 March 2011|newspaper=Nepali Times|date=20–26 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hridaya did not join the ancestral occupation but worked to develop Nepal Bhasa literature. In 1920, he was married to Gyan Prabha Kansakar.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasa.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==

Hridaya was a member of the [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance#Impact|Nepal Bhasa renaissance]]. He began his literary career when the Ranas did not permit writing in Nepal Bhasa, so authors published their works from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hridaya wrote his first poem ''Buddhopasakya Pap Deshana'' which was printed in 1925 in ''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa|Buddha Dharma]]'' magazine published from [[Kolkata]], India.&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Ishwari Mainya (2007). ''Chittadhar Hridayaya Kriti Dhalah (A List of Works by Chittadhar Hridaya)'', ''Chittadhar Hridaya Sachchhidan Budin Lumantipau (Chittadhar Hridaya Birth Centenary Souvenir)''. Kathmandu: Bhintuna Guthi. Page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he signed a petition to open a public library, and was arrested and fined along with the rest of the signers.

In 1933, an anthology of poems by Hridaya entitled ''Padya Nikunja'' was published from [[Kalimpong]], India by SP and DP Upasak. He wrote under the pen name Hridaya to avoid harassment by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2007). ''Kavi Keshari Chittadhar Hridayaya Mhasika (Profile of Kavi Keshari Chittadhar Hridaya)'', ''Chittadhar Hridaya Sachchhidan Budin Lumantipau (Chittadhar Hridaya Birth Centenary Souvenir)''. Kathmandu: Bhintuna Guthi. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The government did not like his literary activities, and all the copies were confiscated by customs at Chisapani Gadhi before they could reach Kathmandu.

The anthology contained a poem entitled ''Mother'' which he had written while mourning his mother's death. He had signed the poem "Motherless child" which the government took to mean that it had deprived the [[Newars]] of their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2006). ''Kavi Keshari Chittadhar Hridaya''. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parishad. Pages 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the poem was deemed subversive; and in 1940, he was sentenced to six years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tumbahang|first=Govinda Bahadur|title=Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal|url=http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/viewFile/18/16|accessdate=1 March 2011|newspaper=Tribhuvan University Journal|date=September 2009}} Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hridaya began his sentence on January 20, 1941. His fellow inmates poets [[Siddhicharan Shrestha]] and [[Phatte Bahadur Singh]] had also been imprisoned for producing works in Nepal Bhasa.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chittadhar Hridaya museum.jpg|200px|thumb|Hridaya's room at the memorial museum.]]
While in jail, Hridaya produced his greatest work [[Sugata Saurabha (epic)|''Sugata Saurabha'']], an epic poem on the life of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He had to write in secret in prison, and his sister Moti Laxmi Upasika smuggled out the scraps of paper on which he had scribbled the verses when she brought him his food.

It was completed in 1946 after his release from prison, and published from Kolkata in 1949. The epic has been described as providing an aesthetically pleasing and doctrinally sound comprehensive account of the Buddha's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/9780195341829/toc.html |title=Sugata Saurabha: An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya |publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online |accessdate=24 February 2013 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a magnum opus in [[Nepal Bhasa literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Mahendra Man |title=Reading the ‘Kavi Kesari’ |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2011/01/07/books/reading-the-kavi-kesari/216976/ |accessdate=24 February 2013 |newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in jail from 1941 to 1945, Hridaya came into contact with artist [[Chandra Man Singh Maskey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webimap.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=3&amp;uid=121|title=Chandra Man Maskey |publisher=Interactive Mapping and Archive Project: [[Cultural mapping|Cultural Mapping]] of Kathmandu Valley |accessdate=6 March 2011|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hridaya trained under Maskey in secret, as he hid his writings from the prison guards. He has produced a number of paintings in water color, pencil and ink. They depict Buddhist and Hindu deities and [[genre scenes]].&lt;ref&gt;Chitrakar, Jagadish (1984). ''Chittadharya Chitrakala (Chittadhar's Paintings)'', ''Nepal Ritupau''. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parishad. Page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The color illustrations in ''Sugata Saurabha'' were done by Maskey.

Following his release from prison on 11 November 1945, Hridaya produced a flurry of works in different genres. He was a pioneer in writing modern short stories. His ''Six Short Stories'' published in 1947 was a landmark in contemporary Nepal Bhasa literature.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2005). ''Contemporary Writing in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: The Foundation for Literature. {{ISBN|99933-2-704-2}}. Page iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nepal Bhasa Parishad==

In 1951, Hridaya got together with other prominent poets and writers and established Nepal Bhasa Parishad (Nepal Bhasa Council) to promote institutional development of Nepal Bhasa. It was inaugurated on 7 June 1953 by Buddha Maya Kansakar, the wife of poet [[Yogbir Singh Kansakar]], amid a ceremony at the home of Tara Bir Singh at Chhetrapati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title= Nepal Bhasa Parisadko Udghatan |url= http://50.57.175.244:8001/xmlui/bitstream/10887/882/1/20100230.pdf
|accessdate= 8 May 2012|newspaper=Gorkhapatra|publisher= |date=12 June 1953}} Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Its office was later moved to his own home at Nyata Tunchhen. Hridaya subsequently bequeathed the property to the council.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2007). ''Kavi Keshari Chittadhar Hridayaya Mhasika (Profile of Kavi Keshari Chittadhar Hridaya)'', ''Chittadhar Hridaya Sachchhidan Budin Lumantipau (Chittadhar Hridaya Birth Centenary Souvenir)''. Kathmandu: Bhintuna Guthi. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hridaya was editor of ''Nepal Ritupau'' published by Nepal Bhasa Parishad from 1952 to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-56-00-X}}. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He also lobbied with the government to have Nepal Bhasa included in the school and college curriculum. It was included in the course of study at the high school level in 1954, at the intermediate level in 1960, bachelor level in 1962 and Master's level in 1979.

Hriday suffered a stroke leaving his right hand and leg paralyzed. He taught himself to write with his left hand and continued to produce poetry and essays. On 9 June 1982, Hridaya collapsed while presiding over a meeting of Nepal Bhasa Parishad.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2006). ''Kavi Keshari Chittadhar Hridaya''. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parishad. Pages 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Nepal's Postal Services Department issued a commemorative postage stamp bearing a portrait of Hridaya on 31 December 1992 to mark the tenth anniversary of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rajan.com/stamps/st1992.htm|title=Rajan's Postage Stamps of Nepal Page|publisher= |accessdate=28 February 2011|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with World Poetry Day, the Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature celebrated the centenary of Chittadhar Hridaya on March 21, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foundationsaarcwriters.com/Detail.aspx?id=MARCH%202007%20NEPAL&amp;type=HISTORY|title=Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature |publisher= |accessdate=4 March 2011|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2008, a statue of Hridaya was erected at Kalimati crossroads in downtown [[Kathmandu]]. Prime Minister [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] unveiled the life-sized image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Nepali people will create prosperous Nepal: PM|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=9550&amp;cat_id=8|accessdate=28 February 2011|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=8 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chittadhar Marg, a street in central Kathmandu, was named in his honor by [[Kathmandu Metropolitan City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/UserFiles/Image/kmc_street_map01.jpg| title =Addressed Road Network Map| work =| publisher =Kathmandu Metropolitan City| date =| accessdate =12 April 2011| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111006214525/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/UserFiles/Image/kmc_street_map01.jpg| archivedate =6 October 2011| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial Museum==

Hridaya's home was renovated in 2010 with Indian assistance to house a museum dedicated to the poet and his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Sood unveils revamped NBP building|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Sood+unveils+revamped+NBP+building&amp;NewsID=246083|accessdate=3 March 2011|newspaper=The Himalayan Times|date=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chittadhar Hridaya Memorial Museum opened on 20 July 2013. It contains photographs, books, sketches, personal belongings and household items. The room where Hridaya lived and worked has been maintained in its original form. Located in the historical section of Kathmandu, the house is also a specimen of traditional Nepalese architecture with [[Newar window]]s of carved wood. It encloses a typical courtyard containing shrines and a well.

==Notable works==

Hridaya wrote epics, dramas, poetry, novels, short stories, history and grammar.

*[[Sugata Saurabha (epic)|''Sugata Saurabha'']] ("The Fragrant Life of the Buddha"), his most famous work, tells of the life of the Buddha in 19 [[canto]]s in a Newar cultural setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religion.utoronto.ca/university-of-torontomcmaster-university-yehan-numata-program-in-buddhist-studies/|title=Sources and Sentiments in Sugata Saurabha |publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=10 March 2011|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been translated into English by Todd T.

*''Mimmanahpau'' ("Unburnt Letter") is a novel-length letter from a merchant in Lhasa to his wife in Kathmandu.

*''Six Short Stories''. Hridaya's short stories are influenced by his interest in cultural revival and social reform. A number of his short stories including three from ''Six Short Stories'' have been translated into English by Tej Ratna Kansakar.&lt;ref&gt;Kansakar, Tej R. (1977). ''Chittadhar's Nepal Bhasa Short Stories.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parishad.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Jhi Maca'' ("Our Child"), published in 1947 from [[Varanasi]], India by Dharmodaya Sabha, is a collection of children's stories that provide an intimate sense of what the culturally vibrant and densely settled Newar society looks like from within.

The '''Cold War''' was a state of geopolitical tension between the [[Soviet Union]] with its [[satellite state]]s (the [[Eastern Bloc]]), and the [[United States]] with its allies (the [[Western Bloc]]) after [[World War II]]. A common [[historiography]] of the conflict begins with 1946, the year U.S. diplomat [[George F. Kennan]]'s "[[Long Telegram]]" from [[Moscow]] cemented a [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] of [[containment]] of Soviet [[World communism|expansionism]] threatening strategically vital regions, and ending between the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the 1991 [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the USSR]], which ended [[communism]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. The term "cold" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, but they each supported major regional wars known as [[proxy war]]s.

The Cold War split the temporary [[Allies of World War II|wartime alliance]] against [[Nazi Germany]], leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two [[superpower]]s with profound economic and political differences. The USSR was a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] state led by its [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], which in turn was dominated by a [[Leader of the Soviet Union|leader]] with different titles over time, and a small committee called the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. The Party controlled the state, the press, the military, the economy and many organizations throughout the [[Second World]], including the [[Warsaw Pact]] and other satellites, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist [[China]], particularly following the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the 1960s. In opposition stood the [[capitalism|capitalist]] West, led by the United States, a [[federal republic]] with a [[two-party]] [[presidential system]]. The [[First World]] nations of the Western Bloc were generally [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] with a free press and independent organizations, but were economically and politically entwined with a network of [[banana republics]] and other authoritarian regimes throughout the [[Third World]], most of which were the Western Bloc's [[Western European colonialism and colonization|former colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jMRkAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cambridge+history+of++capitalism+volume+2#v=onepage&amp;q=banana%20 Geoffrey Jones, "Firms and Global Capitalism" in ''The Cambridge History of Capitalism Volume 2'', Larry Neal et al, eds.

''The Economist'', 21 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Some major Cold War frontlines such as [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] were still Western colonies in 1947.

A neutral bloc arose with the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which sought good relations with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed in preparation for a possible all-out [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear world war]]. Each side had a [[nuclear strategy]] that discouraged an [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|attack]] by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would [[Second strike|lead to the total destruction of the attacker]]—the doctrine of [[Mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction]] (MAD). Aside from the [[nuclear arms race|development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals]], and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, [[psychological warfare]], massive propaganda campaigns and [[Cold War espionage|espionage]], far-reaching [[embargo]]s, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the [[Space Race]].

[[Cold War (1947–1953)|The first phase]] of the Cold War began in the first two years after the end of the Second World War in 1945. The USSR consolidated its control over the states of the Eastern Bloc, while the United States began a strategy of global containment to challenge Soviet power, extending military and financial aid to the countries of Western Europe (for example, supporting the anti-communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]]) and [[North Atlantic Treaty|creating]] the [[NATO|NATO alliance]]. The [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–49) was the first major crisis of the Cold War. With the victory of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist side]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] (1950–53), [[Cold War (1953–1962)|the conflict expanded]]. The USSR and the USA competed for influence in [[Latin America]] and the [[decolonization|decolonizing]] states of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. The Soviets suppressed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. The expansion and escalation sparked more crises, such as the [[Suez Crisis]] (1956), the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962, which was perhaps the closest the two sides came to [[nuclear war]]. Meanwhile, an international [[peace movement]] took root and grew among citizens around the world, first in Japan from 1954, when people became concerned about [[nuclear weapons testing]], but soon also in Europe and the US. The peace movement, and in particular the [[History of the anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear movement]], gained pace and popularity from the late 1950s and early 1960s, and continued to grow through the '70s and '80s with large protest marches, demonstrations and various non-parliamentary activism opposing war and calling for global [[nuclear disarmament]]. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, [[Cold War (1962–1979)|a new phase began]] that saw the [[Sino-Soviet split]] complicate relations within the Communist sphere, while US allies, particularly [[France]], demonstrated greater independence of action. The USSR [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|crushed]] the 1968 [[Prague Spring]] liberalization program in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], while the US experienced internal turmoil from the [[Civil Rights movement]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition]] to the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–75), which ended with the [[Fall of Saigon|defeat]] of the US-backed [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]], prompting further adjustments.

By the 1970s, both sides had become interested in making allowances in order to create a more stable and predictable international system, ushering in a period of [[détente]] that saw [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] and the US [[1972 Nixon visit to China|opening relations]] with the People's Republic of China as a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union. Détente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] in 1979. The [[Cold War (1979–1985)|early 1980s]] were another period of elevated tension, with the Soviet downing of [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007|KAL Flight 007]] and the [[Able Archer 83|"Able Archer" NATO military exercises]], both in 1983. The United States increased [[Reagan Doctrine|diplomatic, military, and economic pressures]] on the Soviet Union, at a time when the communist state was already suffering from [[Era of Stagnation|economic stagnation]]. On 12 June 1982, a million protesters gathered in [[Central Park]], [[New York City|New York]] to call for an end to the Cold War arms race and nuclear weapons in particular. [[Cold War (1985–1991)|In the mid-1980s]], the new Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the liberalizing reforms of ''[[perestroika]]'' ("reorganization", 1987) and ''[[glasnost]]'' ("openness", c. 1985) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. Pressures for national independence grew stronger in [[Eastern Europe]], especially [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]. Gorbachev meanwhile refused to use Soviet troops to bolster the faltering [[Warsaw Pact]] regimes as had occurred in the past. The result in 1989 was [[Revolutions of 1989|a wave of revolutions]] that peacefully (with the exception of the [[Romanian Revolution]]) overthrew all of the communist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control and was banned following an [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|abortive coup attempt]] in August 1991. This in turn led to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|formal dissolution of the USSR]] in December 1991 and the collapse of communist regimes in other countries such as [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|Cambodia]] and [[South Yemen]]. The United States remained as the world's only superpower.

The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy. It is often referred to in [[Culture during the Cold War|popular culture]], especially in media featuring themes of [[espionage]] (notably the internationally successful ''[[James Bond]]'' book and film franchise) and the threat of nuclear warfare. Meanwhile, a renewed state of tension between the Soviet Union's successor state, [[Russia]], and the United States in the 2010s (including its Western allies) has been referred to as the [[Second Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Guterres"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43759873|title=Syria crisis: UN chief says Cold War is back|date=13 April 2018|accessdate=13 April 2018|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
{{Main|Cold war (general term)}}
{{History Of The Cold War}}
At the end of World War II, English writer [[George Orwell]] used ''[[Cold war (general term)|cold war]]'', as a general term, in his essay "You and the Atomic Bomb", published 19 October 1945 in the British newspaper ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]''. Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of [[nuclear warfare]], Orwell looked at [[James Burnham]]'s predictions of a polarized world, writing:

{{quote|Looking at the world as a whole, the drift for many decades has been not towards anarchy but towards the reimposition of slavery... James Burnham's theory has been much discussed, but few people have yet considered its ideological implications—that is, the kind of world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a state which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of "cold war" with its neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, "[http://orwell.ru/library/articles/ABomb/english/e_abomb You and the Atomic Bomb]", ''Tribune'' 19 October 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The Observer'' of 10 March 1946, Orwell wrote, "after the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a 'cold war' on Britain and the British Empire."&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George, ''The Observer'', 10 March 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

The first use of the term to describe the specific post-war geopolitical confrontation between the USSR and the United States came in a speech by [[Bernard Baruch]], an influential advisor to Democratic presidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 16 April 1947. The speech, written by journalist [[Herbert Bayard Swope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Safire|authorlink=William Safire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/opinion/01iht-edsafire.2988871.html|title=Islamofascism Anyone?|work=The New York Times|date=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed, "Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=History.com Staff|title=This Day on History – April 16, 1947: Bernard Baruch coins the term "Cold War"|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bernard-baruch-coins-the-term-cold-war|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper columnist [[Walter Lippmann]] gave the term wide currency with his book ''The Cold War''. When asked in 1947 about the source of the term, Lippmann traced it to a French term from the 1930s, ''la guerre froide''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strobe Talbott]], ''The Great Experiment: The Story of Ancient Empires, Modern States, and the Quest for a Global Nation'' (2009) p.441 n.3; Lippmann's own book is {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ydc3AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=walter+lippmann+cold+war&amp;dq=walter+lippmann+cold+war|author=Lippmann, Walter|title=The Cold War|publisher=Harper|year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Origins of the Cold War}}

===Russian Revolution===
[[File:Wladiwostok Parade 1918.jpg|thumb|Allied troops in [[Vladivostok]], August 1918, during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]]]

While most historians trace the origins of the Cold War to the period immediately following World War II, others argue that it began with the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]] in 1917 when the [[Bolsheviks]] took power.&lt;ref name = "Gaddis"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 [[Lenin]] stated that his new state was surrounded by a "hostile capitalist encirclement", and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon that should be used to keep the Soviet Union's enemies divided, beginning with the establishment of the [[Communist International]], which called for revolutionary upheavals abroad.&lt;ref name="Palmieri34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Palmieri|1989|p=62}}{{Citation not found|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Max Beloff argues that the Soviets saw "no prospect of permanent peace", with the 1922 Soviet Constitution proclaiming:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the time of the formation of the soviet republics, the states of the world have divided into two camps: the camp of capitalism and the camp of socialism. There – in the camp of capitalism – national enmity and inequality, colonial slavery, and chauvinism, national oppression and pogroms, imperialist brutalities and wars. Here – in the camp of socialism – mutual confidence and peace, national freedom and equality, a dwelling together in peace and the brotherly collaboration of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Max Beloff, ''The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia 1929-1936'' (vol 1, 1947) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to British historian Christopher Sutton:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In what some have called the First Cold War, from Britain's intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1918 to its uneasy alliance with the Soviet Union against the Axis powers in 1941, British distrust of the revolutionary and regicidal Bolsheviks resulted in domestic, foreign, and colonial policies aimed at resisting the spread of communism. This conflict after 1945 took on new battlefields, new weapons, new players, and a greater intensity, but it was still fundamentally a conflict against Soviet imperialism (real and imagined).&lt;ref&gt;Chrtistopher Sutton,  [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-33491-2_2 ''Britain's Cold War in Cyprus and Hong Kong: A Conflict of Empires'' (2016), abstract of ch. 1 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea of long-term continuity is a minority scholarly view that has been challenged. Frank Ninkovich writes:

{{quote|As for the two cold wars thesis, the chief problem is that the two periods are incommensurable. To be sure, they were joined together by enduring ideological hostility, but in the post-World War I years Bolshevism was not a geopolitical menace. After World War II, in contrast, the Soviet Union was a superpower that combined ideological antagonism with the kind of geopolitical threat posed by Germany and Japan in the Second World War. Even with more amicable relations in the 1920s, it is conceivable that post-1945 relations would have turned out much the same.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Ninkovich, "The First Cold War" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' (2003) 33#3 pp 688-90.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Beginnings of World War II===
After signing the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[German–Soviet Frontier Treaty]], the Soviet Union forced the [[Baltic states|Baltic countries]]—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—to allow it [[Background of the occupation of the Baltic states#Soviet ultimatums and occupation|to station Soviet troops in their countries]] under pacts of "mutual assistance".{{sfn|Smith|Pabriks|Purs|Lane|2002|p=24}}{{sfn|Bilinsky|1999|p=9}}{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|pp=55–6}} Finland rejected territorial demands, prompting a Soviet invasion in November 1939.{{sfn|Spring|1986|p=207-226}} The resulting [[Winter War]] ended in March 1940 with [[Moscow Peace Treaty|Finnish concessions]].{{sfn|Hanhimäki|1997|p=12}} Britain and France, treating the Soviet attack on Finland as tantamount to its entering the war on the side of the Germans, responded to the Soviet invasion by supporting the USSR's expulsion from the [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|pp=55–6}}

In June 1940, the Soviet Union forcibly annexed [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania]],{{sfn|Bilinsky|1999|p=9}} and the disputed Romanian regions of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and Hertza]]. But after the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 and the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombed Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers formed an alliance of convenience. Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied Britain, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations through its [[Lend-Lease]] Program.&lt;ref&gt;George C. Herring Jr., ''Aid to Russia, 1941–1946: Strategy, Diplomacy, the Origins of the Cold War'' (Columbia University Press, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stalin remained highly suspicious, and he believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Nazi Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last minute and shape the peace settlement. Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|pp=151–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of World War II (1945–1947)==

===Wartime conferences regarding post-war Europe===
{{Further|Tehran Conference|Yalta Conference}}
The Allies disagreed about how the European map should look, and how borders would be drawn, following the war.&lt;ref name="Gaddis13-23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=13–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security.&lt;ref name="Gaddis13-23" /&gt; Some scholars contend that all the Western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through [[international organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others note that the Atlantic powers were divided in their vision of the new post-war world. Roosevelt's goals—military victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the [[British Empire]], and the creation of a world peace organization—were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a [[Buffer state|buffer]] between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref Name=Plokhy&gt;{{Harvnb|Plokhy|2010|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&amp;W).jpg|thumb|left|The "[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]" at the Yalta Conference: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], 1945]]

The Soviet Union sought to dominate the internal affairs of countries in its border regions.&lt;ref name="Gaddis13-23" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Stalin had created special training centers for communists from different countries so that they could set up secret police forces loyal to Moscow as soon as the Red Army took control. Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Frankel]], "Stalin's Shadow", [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/books/review/iron-curtain-by-anne-applebaum.html ''New York Times'' 21 Nov 2012] reviewing Anne Applebaum, ''Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944–1956'' (2012), See Introduction, text after note 26, and ch. 3, 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States, hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, p. 27. "From the Soviet perspective, a postwar period of peace and reconstruction was indispensable. Therefore, the continuation of cooperation and peaceful relations with its wartime allies, the United States and Great Britain, was greatly to be desired."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American view, Stalin seemed a potential ally in accomplishing their goals, whereas in the British approach Stalin appeared as the greatest threat to the fulfillment of their agenda. With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage, and the two western leaders vied for his favors.

The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets. In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and proposed the "[[percentages agreement]]" to divide the [[Balkans]] into respective [[spheres of influence]], including giving Stalin predominance [[Romania in World War II|over Romania]] and Bulgaria and Churchill carte blanche [[White Terror (Greece)|over Greece.]] At the [[Yalta Conference]] of February 1945, Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and the Reparations.&lt;ref Name=Plokhy/&gt; Roosevelt ultimately approved the percentage agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTPzJRV9hhgC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=He+said+that+the+Americans+would+be+shocked+if+they+saw+how+crudely+he+had+put+it.+Marshal+Stalin+was+a+realist.#v=snippet&amp;q=%22a+decision+of+great+importance%22|title=Churchill and the Soviet Union|first=David|last=Carlton|date=16 March 2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VCX-CwAAQBAJ&amp;q=percentages+agreement#v=snippet&amp;q=percentages%20agreement Allan Todd, ''History for the IB Diploma Paper 3: The Soviet Union and Post-Soviet Russia'' (Cambridge University Press, 2016), p.105-111]&lt;/ref&gt; but there was still apparently no firm consensus on the framework for a post-war settlement in Europe.&lt;ref name="Gaddis21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|Post-war [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation zones in Germany]]]]

At the [[Second Quebec Conference]], a high-level military conference held in Quebec City, 12–16 September 1944, Churchill and Roosevelt reached agreement on a number of matters, including a plan for Germany based on [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]]'s original proposal. The memorandum drafted by Churchill provided for "eliminating the warmaking industries in the Ruhr and the Saar ... looking forward to [[Morgenthau Plan|converting Germany into a country primarily agricultural]] and pastoral in its character." However, it no longer included a plan to partition the country into several independent states.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Government Printing Office]], Report on the Morgenthau Diaries prepared by the Subcommittee of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] Committee of the Judiciary appointed to investigate the Administration of the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] and other Internal Security Laws, (Washington, 1967) volume 1, pp. 620–21&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 1945, President Truman signed the U.S. occupation directive [[JCS 1067]], which was in effect for over two years, and was enthusiastically supported by Stalin. It directed the U.S. forces of occupation to "...take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Some historians have argued that the Cold War began when [[Operation Sunrise (World War II)|the US negotiated a separate peace]] with [[Schutzstaffel|Nazi SS]] General [[Karl Wolff]] in northern Italy. The Soviet Union was not allowed to participate and the dispute led to heated correspondence between Franklin Roosevelt and Stalin. General Wolff, a war criminal, appears to have been guaranteed immunity at the [[Nuremberg trials]] by Office of Strategic Services ([[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]]) commander (and later [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director) [[Allen Dulles]] when they met in March 1945. Wolff and his forces were being considered to help implement [[Operation Unthinkable]], a secret plan to invade the Soviet Union which Winston Churchill advocated during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VdsAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=karl+wolff,+oss#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20obvious%20shielding%20of%20Wolff Kerstin von Lingen, ''Allen Dulles, the OSS, and Nazi War Criminals'' (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 6, 81-90]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/opinion/16iht-edrev.html|title=Opinion {{!}} An Absurdist Film That Touches on Wartime Reality|last=Rev|first=Istvan|

In April 1945, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by [[Harry S. Truman]], who distrusted Stalin and turned for advice to an [[The Wise Men (book)#The "Wise Men"|elite group]] of foreign policy intellectuals. Both Churchill and Truman opposed, among other things, the Soviets' decision to prop up the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation|Lublin government]], the Soviet-controlled rival to the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London, whose relations with the Soviets had been severed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zubok|1996|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[End of World War II in Europe|Allies' May 1945 victory]], the Soviets effectively occupied Central and Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="Gaddis21" /&gt; while strong US and Western allied forces remained in Western Europe. In [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]] and [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]], France, Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States established zones of occupation and a loose framework for parceled four-power control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|1945 Allied conference in San Francisco]] established the multi-national [[United Nations]] (UN) for the maintenance of [[world peace]], but the enforcement capacity of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] was effectively paralyzed by the ability of individual members to exercise [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bourantonis|1996|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric, and the Soviets regarded it almost exclusively as a propaganda tribune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garthoff|1994|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central and Eastern European territories liberated from the Nazis and occupied by the Soviet armed forces were added to the [[Eastern Bloc]] by converting them into [[satellite state]]s,&lt;ref name = "Schmitz" /&gt; such as:

The Soviet-style regimes that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet [[command economy|command economies]], but also adopted the brutal methods employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and the Soviet secret police in order to suppress both real and potential opposition.&lt;ref name="roht83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roht-Arriaza|1995|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia, the Red Army had overrun [[Manchuria]] in the last month of the war, and it went on to occupy the large swathe of Korean territory located north of the 38th parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of consolidating Stalin's control over the Eastern Bloc, the [[NKVD|People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs]] (NKVD), led by [[Lavrentiy Beriya]], supervised the establishment of Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc that were supposed to crush anti-communist resistance.&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 34"/&gt; When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was concerned that, given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of the war, and the perception that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Fenton, Ben |url=http://webarchiveproject.org/26299/ |title=The secret strategy to launch attack on Red Army |deadurl=yes |accessdate=29 January 2017 |date=1 October 1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528222149/http://webarchiveproject.org/26299/ |archivedate=28 May 2008 |df=dmy |publisher=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, US officials guided Western European leaders in establishing their own secret security force to prevent subversion in the Western bloc, which evolved into [[Operation Gladio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/lory1.ethz.ch/collections/coll_gladio/chronology76c1.html?navinfo=15301|title=Parallel History Project on Cooperative Security (PHP) - NATO's Secret Armies: Chronology|first=PHP|last=Editors|website=www.php.isn.ethz.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February 1946, [[George F. Kennan]]'s "[[Long Telegram]]" from Moscow to Washington helped to articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets, which would became the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War. The Truman Administration was receptive to the Telegram due to broken promises by Stalin concerning Europe and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schecter|2003|pp=152–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the WWII [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]], the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=1946: The Making of the Modern World|last=Sebestyen|first=Victor|publisher=Pan Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=0230758002|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran was used by the United States and British to supply the Soviet Union, and the Allies agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, when this deadline came, the Soviets remained in Iran under the guise of the [[People's Republic of Azerbaijan]] and [[Kurdish separatism in Iran|Kurdish]] [[Republic of Mahabad]].&lt;ref&gt;''All the Shah's Men'', Kinzer, p.65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter on March 5, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous "[[Iron Curtain]]" speech in [[Fulton, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech called for an Anglo-American alliance against the Soviets, whom he accused of establishing an "iron curtain" dividing Europe from "[[Szczecin|Stettin]] in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to [[Trieste]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]".&lt;ref name = "Schmitz"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Schmitz, David F.|authorlink=David F.

A week later, on March 13, Stalin responded vigorously to the speech, saying that Churchill could be compared to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] insofar as he advocated the racial superiority of [[List of territorial entities where English is an official language|English-speaking nations]] so that they could satisfy their hunger for world domination, and that such a declaration was "a call for war on the U.S.S.R." The Soviet leader also dismissed the accusation that the USSR was exerting increasing control over the countries lying in its sphere. He argued that there was nothing surprising in "the fact that the Soviet Union, anxious for its future safety, [was] trying to see to it that governments loyal in their attitude to the Soviet Union should exist in these countries".&lt;ref&gt;''Marxists Internet Archive'', https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1946/03/x01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCauwley, Martin, ''Origins of the Cold War 1941–49: Revised 3rd Edition'', Routledge, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1405874335}}, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, the Soviet side produced the [[Nikolai Vasilevich Novikov|Novikov]] telegram, sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and "co-authored" by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]; it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability "to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kydd|2005|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 1946, [[James F.

By 1947, US president [[Harry S.

In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully attempted to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="miller16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1947, in accordance with the [[Truman Doctrine]], the United States enacted the [[Marshall Plan]], a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189.39 billion in 2016) to rebuild the [[economy of Europe]]. Later, the program led to the creation of the [[OECD#Organisation for European Economic Co-operation|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]].

The plan's aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to [[European balance of power|Europe's balance of power]], such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html|title=Pas de Pagaille!|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=28 July 1947|accessdate=28 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, Truman signed the [[National Security Act of 1947]], creating a unified [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC). These would become the main bureaucracies for US defense policy in the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Karabell" &gt;{{Harvnb|Karabell|1999|p=916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin believed that economic integration with the West would allow [[Eastern Bloc]] countries to escape Soviet control, and that the US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe.&lt;ref name="Gaddis32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid.&lt;ref name="Gaddis32" /&gt; The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, became known as the [[Molotov Plan]] (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]]).&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993" /&gt; Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1948, following reports of strengthening "reactionary elements", Soviet operatives executed a [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup d'état]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], the only Eastern Bloc state that the Soviets had permitted to retain democratic structures.&lt;ref name="wettig86"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1997|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public brutality of the coup shocked Western powers more than any event up to that point, set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.&lt;ref name="miller19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twin policies of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey. With the US assistance, the Greek military [[Greek Civil War|won its civil war]].&lt;ref name="Karabell" /&gt; Under the leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]] the Italian [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] defeated the powerful [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]]-[[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist]] alliance in the [[Italian general election, 1948|elections of 1948]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time there was increased intelligence and espionage activity, [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc defections]] and diplomatic expulsions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cowley|1996|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cominform and the Tito–Stalin Split===
{{Main|Cominform|Tito–Stalin Split}}
In September 1947, the Soviets created [[Cominform]], the purpose of which was to enforce orthodoxy within the international communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet [[Satellite state|satellites]] through coordination of communist parties in the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name="Gaddis32" /&gt; Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the [[Tito–Stalin Split]] obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carabott|Sfikas|2004|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin Blockade and airlift===
{{Main|Berlin Blockade}}
[[File:C-47s at Tempelhof Airport Berlin 1948.jpg|thumb|left|C-47s unloading at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] in Berlin during the Berlin Blockade]]

The United States and Britain merged their western German occupation zones into [[Bizone|"Bizonia"]] (1 January 1947, later "Trizonia" with the addition of France's zone, April 1949).&lt;ref name="miller13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system.&lt;ref name="miller18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in accordance with the [[Marshall Plan]], they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the German economy, including the introduction of a new [[Deutsche Mark]] currency to replace the old [[Reichsmark]] currency that the Soviets had debased.&lt;ref name="miller31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted the [[Berlin Blockade]] (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949), one of the first major crises of the Cold War, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began the massive "Berlin airlift", supplying West Berlin with food and other provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=65–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the policy change. Once again the East Berlin communists attempted to disrupt the [[Berlin Blockade#December elections|Berlin municipal elections]] (as they had done in the 1946 elections),&lt;ref name="miller13"/&gt; which were held on 5 December 1948 and produced a turnout of 86.3% and an overwhelming victory for the non-communist parties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Ashby Turner|Turner, Henry Ashby]], ''The Two Germanies Since 1945: East and West'', Yale University Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-300-03865-8}}, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; The results effectively divided the city into East and West versions of its former self. 300,000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue,&lt;ref&gt;Fritsch-Bournazel, Renata, ''Confronting the German Question: Germans on the East-West Divide'', Berg Publishers, 1990, {{ISBN|0-85496-684-6}}, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; and US Air Force pilot [[Gail Halvorsen]] created "[[Operation Vittles]]", which supplied candy to German children.&lt;ref name="miller26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1949, Stalin backed down and lifted the blockade.&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=180–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Stalin repeatedly [[Stalin Note|proposed a plan]] to unify East and West Germany under a single government chosen in elections supervised by the United Nations, if the new Germany were to stay out of Western military alliances, but this proposal was turned down by the Western powers. Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, Rudd.

Britain, France, the United States, Canada and other eight western European countries signed the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] of April 1949, establishing the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 34"/&gt; That August, the [[RDS-1|first Soviet atomic device]] was detonated in [[Semipalatinsk]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]].&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993" /&gt; Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948,&lt;ref name="miller18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="turner23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1987|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of West Germany from the [[Bizone|three Western zones of occupation]] in April 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Heike Bungert, "A New Perspective on French-American Relations during the Occupation of Germany, 1945–1948: Behind-the-Scenes Diplomatic Bargaining and the Zonal Merger."

Media in the [[Eastern Bloc]] was an [[Eastern Bloc media and propaganda|organ of the state]], completely reliant on and subservient to the communist party. Radio and television organizations were state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party.&lt;ref name="oneil15"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neil|first=Patrick|title=Post-communism and the Media in Eastern Europe|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0-7146-4765-9|pages=15–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were inherent in the system.&lt;ref&gt;James Wood, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennan.&lt;ref name="Puddington7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American policymakers, including Kennan and [[John Foster Dulles]], acknowledged that the Cold War was in its essence a war of ideas.&lt;ref name=Puddington7 /&gt; The United States, acting through the CIA, funded a long list of projects to counter the communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA also [[Secrecy|covertly]] sponsored a domestic propaganda campaign called [[Crusade for Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Richard H.|title=Radio Free Europe's "Crusade for freedom": Rallying Americans behind Cold War Broadcasting, 1950–1960|year=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-4410-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BO78hXsRebkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Civil War and SEATO===

[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin in Moscow, December 1949]]

In 1949, [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]] defeated [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s United States-backed [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly created an alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Norwegian historian [[Odd Arne Westad]], the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against Japan]]. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of [[Chinese nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Westad|2012|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang and his KMT government retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]]. Confronted with the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|communist revolution in China]] and [[Soviet atomic bomb project|the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949]], the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand its [[containment]] policy.&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993" /&gt; In [[NSC 68]], a secret 1950 document,&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 164"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Security Council proposed to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense.&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993" /&gt;

United States officials moved thereafter to expand containment into [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]], in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements, often led by communist parties financed by the USSR, fighting against the restoration of Europe's colonial empires in South-East Asia and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 212"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the "[[Pactomania]]"), the US formalized a series of alliances with [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Thailand]] and the [[Philippines]] (notably [[ANZUS]] in 1951 and [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.&lt;ref name="Byrd" /&gt;

===Korean War===

[[File:IncheonLandingMcArthur.jpg|thumb|left|General [[Douglas MacArthur]], UN Command CiC (seated), observes the naval shelling of [[Incheon]] from [[USS Mount McKinley (AGC-7)|USS ''Mt. McKinley'']], 15 September 1950]]

One of the more significant examples of the implementation of containment was US intervention in the [[Korean War]]. In June 1950, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s [[Korean People's Army|North Korean People's Army]] invaded South Korea.&lt;ref name="Stokesbury1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short History of the Korean War|last=Stokesbury |first=James L|year=1990|publisher=Harper Perennial |location=New York|isbn=0-688-09513-5|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin approved and sent advisers to plan the North Korean invasion.{{sfn|Weathersby|1993|pp=28, 30}} To Stalin's surprise,&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993" /&gt; the [[UN Security Council]] backed the defense of South Korea, though the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest that [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] and not [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]] held a permanent seat on the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Malkasian|2001|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United Nations Command|UN force]] of personnel from South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Canada, Colombia, Australia, France, South Africa, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand and other countries joined to stop the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.

[[File:KoreanWar recover Seoul.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[U.S. Marines]] engaged in street fighting during the liberation of [[Seoul]], September 1950]]

Among other effects, the Korean War galvanised [[NATO]] to develop a military structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Isby|Kamps|1985|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong opposition to the war often strained [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American relations]]. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and for withdrawal of all foreign forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cotton|first=James|title=The Korean war in history|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1989|page=100|url=|id=|isbn=0-7190-2984-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the Chinese and North Koreans were exhausted by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice]] was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death.&lt;ref name = "Byrd" /&gt; North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] dictatorship—which continues to date—according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable [[cult of personality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Oberdorfer|Oberdorfer, Don]], ''The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History'', Basic Books, 2001, {{ISBN|0-465-05162-6}}, page&amp;nbsp;10–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[No Kum-sok|No, Kum-Sok]] and J.

===Khrushchev, Eisenhower and de-Stalinization===
[[File:1959 NATO and WP troop strengths in Europe.svg|thumb|NATO and Warsaw Pact troop strengths in Europe in 1959]]

In 1953, changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Karabell, p. 916&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was inaugurated president that January. During the last 18&amp;nbsp;months of the Truman administration, the American defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively.&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993" /&gt;

After the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the Soviet leader following the deposition and execution of [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and the pushing aside of rivals [[Georgy Malenkov]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] by [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a campaign of [[de-Stalinization]], he declared that the only way to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.&lt;ref name = "Karabell" /&gt;

On 18 November 1956, while addressing Western ambassadors at a reception at the Polish embassy in Moscow, Khrushchev used his famous "Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you" expression, shocking everyone present.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867329,00.html We Will Bury You!]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'', 26 November 1956. Retrieved 26 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed that he had not been talking about nuclear war, but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Khrushchev declared that even if the USSR was behind the West, within a decade its housing shortage would disappear, consumer goods would be abundant, and within two decades, the "construction of a communist society" in the USSR would be completed "in the main".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tompson|1997|pp=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, initiated a "[[New Look (policy)|New Look]]" for the [[containment]] strategy, calling for a greater reliance on nuclear weapons against US enemies in wartime.&lt;ref name="Karabell" /&gt; Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of "massive retaliation", threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression. Possessing nuclear superiority, for example, allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993" /&gt; US plans for nuclear war in the late 1950s included the "systematic destruction" of 1200 major urban centers in the Eastern Bloc and China, including Moscow, East Berlin and Beijing, with their civilian populations among the primary targets.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Bradner (23 December 2015).

While [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death in 1953 slightly relaxed tensions, the situation in Europe remained an uneasy armed truce.&lt;ref name="Palmowski"&gt;{{Harvnb|Palmowski|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the [[Eastern Bloc]] by 1949,&lt;ref&gt;Feldbrugge, p. 818&lt;/ref&gt; established a formal alliance therein, the [[Warsaw Pact]], in 1955.&lt;ref name="Byrd" /&gt;

From 1957 through 1961, Khrushchev openly and repeatedly threatened the West with nuclear annihilation. He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States, capable of wiping out any American or European city. However, Khrushchev rejected Stalin's belief in the inevitability of war, and declared his new goal was to be "peaceful coexistence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formulation modified the Stalin-era Soviet stance, where international [[class conflict]] meant the two opposing camps were on an inevitable collision course where communism would triumph through global war; now, peace would allow capitalism to collapse on its own,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Perlmutter|1997|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as giving the Soviets time to boost their military capabilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Njolstad|2004|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; which remained for decades until Gorbachev's later "new thinking" envisioning peaceful coexistence as an end in itself rather than a form of class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Breslauer, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The events in Hungary produced ideological fractures within the communist parties of the world, particularly in Western Europe, with great decline in membership as many in both western and communist countries felt disillusioned by the brutal Soviet response.&lt;ref name=Lendvai196&gt;{{cite book|last=Lendvai|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Lendvai|title=One Day that Shook the Communist World: The 1956 Hungarian Uprising and Its Legacy|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|page=196|isbn=0-691-13282-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communist parties in the West would never recover from the effect the Hungarian Revolution had on their membership, a fact that was immediately recognized by some, such as the Yugoslavian politician [[Milovan Djilas|Milovan Đilas]] who shortly after the revolution was crushed said that "The wound which the Hungarian Revolution inflicted on communism can never be completely healed".&lt;ref name=Lendvai196/&gt;

America's pronouncements concentrated on American strength abroad and the success of liberal capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Joshel, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the late 1960s, the "battle for men's minds" between two systems of social organization that Kennedy spoke of in 1961 was largely over, with tensions henceforth based primarily on clashing geopolitical objectives rather than ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Rycroft, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin ultimatum and European integration===
{{Main|Berlin Crisis of 1961#Berlin ultimatum|European integration}}
During November 1958, Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent, demilitarized "free city". He gave the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans. Khrushchev earlier explained to [[Mao Zedong]] that "Berlin is the testicles of the West. Every time I want to make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in mid-December and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question.&lt;ref&gt;Glees, pp. 126–27&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, one hallmark of the 1950s was the beginning of [[European integration]]—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War. Truman and Eisenhower promoted the concept politically, economically, and militarily, but later administrations viewed it ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-aligned Indonesian government of [[Sukarno]] was faced with a major threat to its legitimacy beginning in 1956, when several regional commanders began to demand autonomy from [[Jakarta]]. After mediation failed, Sukarno took action to remove the dissident commanders. In February 1958, dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia]]-[[Permesta]] Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime. They were joined by many civilian politicians from the [[Masyumi Party]], such as [[Sjafruddin Prawiranegara]], who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Partai Komunis Indonesia]] party. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received arms, funding, and other covert aid from the CIA until [[Allen Lawrence Pope]], an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] in April 1958. The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds [[Padang]] and [[Manado]].

In [[British Guiana]], the leftist [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) candidate [[Cheddi Jagan]] won the position of chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953, but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain's suspension of the still-dependent nation's constitution.&lt;ref name="Rose 2002, 167"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Euclid A. |title=Dependency and Socialism in the Modern Caribbean: Superpower Intervention in Guyana, Jamaica, and Grenada, 1970–1985 |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2002 |location=Lanham |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkPb3-krfQgC |isbn=978-0-7391-0448-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues.&lt;ref name="Mars &amp; Young 2004, xviii"&gt;Mars, Perry &amp; Alma H.

Worn down by the [[First Indochina War|communist guerrilla war for Vietnamese independence]] and handed a watershed defeat by communist [[Viet Minh]] rebels at the 1954 [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], the French accepted a negotiated abandonment of their colonial stake in [[Vietnam]]. In the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]], peace accords were signed, leaving Vietnam divided between a pro-Soviet administration in [[North Vietnam]] and a pro-Western administration in [[South Vietnam]] at the [[17th parallel north]]. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower's United States sent economic aid and military advisers to strengthen South Vietnam's pro-Western regime against communist efforts to destabilize it.&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993"/&gt;

Many emerging nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected the pressure to choose sides in the East-West competition. In 1955, at the [[Bandung Conference]] in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the [[Belgrade]]-headquartered [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="Karabell" /&gt; Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with [[India]] and other key neutral states. Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.&lt;ref name = "Lafeber 1993" /&gt;

The period after 1956 was marked by serious setbacks for the Soviet Union, most notably the breakdown of the Sino-Soviet alliance, beginning the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev criticized him in 1956, and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge.&lt;ref name="Gaddis142" /&gt; For his part, Khrushchev, disturbed by Mao's glib attitude toward nuclear war, referred to the Chinese leader as a "lunatic on a throne".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kempe|first=Frederick|authorlink=Frederick Kempe |title=Berlin 1961|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group (USA)|isbn=0-399-15729-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Khrushchev made many desperate attempts to reconstitute the Sino-Soviet alliance, but Mao considered it useless and denied any proposal.&lt;ref name="Gaddis142"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese-Soviet animosity spilled out in an intra-communist propaganda war.&lt;ref&gt;Lüthi, pp. 273–276&lt;/ref&gt; Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao's China for leadership of the global communist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Lorenz M. Lüthi argues:
:The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and [[China–United States relations#Rapprochement|Sino-American rapprochement]]. The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorenz M.

On the [[nuclear weapon]]s front, the United States and the USSR pursued nuclear rearmament and developed long-range weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other.&lt;ref name = "Byrd" /&gt; In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world's first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM),&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and in October they launched the first Earth satellite, [[Sputnik 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/4/newsid_2685000/2685115.stm|title=Sputnik satellite blasts into space|publisher=BBC News|date=4 October 1957|accessdate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the [[Space Race]].

In [[Cuba]], the [[26th of July Movement]], led by young revolutionaries [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]], seized power in the [[Cuban Revolution]] on 1 January 1959, toppling President [[Fulgencio Batista]], whose unpopular regime had been denied arms by the Eisenhower administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blumberg |first=Arnold |title=Great Leaders, Great Tyrants?: Contemporary Views of World Rulers Who Made History |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1995 |location=Westport, Connecticut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nofUu5tvJ18C |isbn=978-0-313-28751-0 |pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cuba–United States relations|Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States]] continued for some time after Batista's fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Castro during the latter's trip to [[Washington, D.C.]] in April, leaving Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] to conduct the meeting in his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lechuga Hevia |first=Carlos |title=Cuba and the Missile Crisis |publisher=Ocean Press |year=2001 |location=Melbourne, Australia |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKLrYxcDg2wC |isbn=978-1-876175-34-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba began negotiating for arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dominguez|1989|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Army tanks face off against Soviet tanks, Berlin 1961.jpg|thumb|[[Tanks in the Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Tanks of the United States|American tanks]] face each other at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] during the Berlin Crisis of 1961.]]

The [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and [[History of Germany (1945–90)|post–World War II Germany]]. By the early 1950s, the [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement]] was emulated by most of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name="dowty114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, hundreds of thousands of [[East Germany|East Germans]] annually emigrated to [[West Germany]] through a "loophole" in the system that existed between East and West Berlin, where the four occupying World War II powers governed movement.&lt;ref name="harrison99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emigration resulted in a massive "[[Human capital flight|brain drain]]" from East Germany to West Germany of younger educated professionals, such that nearly 20% of East Germany's population had migrated to West Germany by 1961.&lt;ref name="dowty122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; That June, the [[Soviet Union]] issued a new [[ultimatum]] demanding the withdrawal of [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] from [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request was rebuffed, and on 13 August, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the [[Berlin Wall]], effectively closing the loophole.&lt;ref name="pearson75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearson|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Cuban Project|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
[[File:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of a Soviet missile site in [[Cuba]], taken by a US [[Surveillance aircraft|spy aircraft]], 1 November 1962]]

The Kennedy administration continued seeking ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs Invasion, experimenting with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government. Significant hopes were pinned on a covert program named the [[Cuban Project]], devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961. Khrushchev learned of the project in February 1962,&lt;ref name="Zubok 1994, 158-159"&gt;Zubok, Vladislav M. (1994). "Unwrapping the Enigma: What Was Behind the Soviet Challenge in the 1960s?".

New York: Columbia University Press. p.&amp;nbsp;158–159. {{ISBN|978-0-231-08177-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response.&lt;ref name="Zubok 1994, 158-159"/&gt;

Alarmed, Kennedy considered various reactions. He ultimately responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade, and he presented an ultimatum to the Soviets. Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation, and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for an American pledge not to invade Cuba again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Howard |title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations from 1945 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |location=Lanham |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwEu5Yv9KiUC |isbn=978-0-7425-6454-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro later admitted that "I would have agreed to the use of nuclear weapons. ... we took it for granted that it would become a nuclear war anyway, and that we were going to disappear."&lt;ref&gt;James G. Blight (2002), ''Cuba on the Brink: Castro, the Missile Crisis, and the Soviet Collapse'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield,, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (October–November 1962) brought the world closer to [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftermath of the crisis led to the first efforts in the [[nuclear arms race]] at nuclear disarmament and improving relations,&lt;ref name="Palmowski" /&gt; although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], had come into force in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council Committee on Antarctic Policy and Science, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Khrushchev's Kremlin colleagues managed to [[Nikita Khrushchev#Removal|oust]] him, but allowed him a peaceful retirement.&lt;ref name="Gaddis119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accused of rudeness and incompetence, he was also credited with ruining Soviet agriculture and bringing the world to the [[Brinkmanship#Cold War|brink of nuclear war]].&lt;ref name="Gaddis119" /&gt; Khrushchev had become an international embarrassment when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall, a public humiliation for Marxism–Leninism.&lt;ref name="Gaddis119" /&gt;

In the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs.&lt;ref name = "Karabell" /&gt; From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while [[Eastern Bloc economies|Eastern Bloc economies stagnated]].&lt;ref name="Karabell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hardt16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]], combined with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the [[OPEC|Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC) and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], less powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower.&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 212"/&gt; Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems.&lt;ref name="Karabell" /&gt; During this period, Soviet leaders such as [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Alexei Kosygin]] embraced the notion of [[détente]].&lt;ref name = "Karabell" /&gt;

===French withdrawal from NATO===
{{Main|NATO#French withdrawal|Foreign policy of Charles de Gaulle}}
The unity of NATO was breached early in its history, with a crisis occurring during [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency of France. De Gaulle protested at the strong role of the United States in the organization and what he perceived as a [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] between the United States and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] on 17 September 1958, he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the United States and the United Kingdom, and also for the expansion of NATO's coverage to include geographical areas of interest to France, most notably [[French Algeria]], where France was waging a counter-insurgency and sought NATO assistance.&lt;ref name=deGuaulle&gt;{{cite book|last=Menon |first=Anand | authorlink = Anand Menon |title=France, NATO, and the limits of independence, 1981–97: the politics of ambivalence |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2000 |page=11 |url=|id=|isbn=0-312-22931-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle considered the response he received to be unsatisfactory, and began the development of an [[Force de dissuasion|independent French nuclear deterrent]].

{{quote|When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries.}}

During the Vietnam War, North Vietnam invaded and occupied parts of Cambodia to use as military bases, which contributed to the violence of the [[Cambodian Civil War]] between the pro-American government of [[Lon Nol]] and communist [[Khmer Rouge]] insurgents.

As a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], tensions along the Chinese–Soviet border [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|reached their peak]] in 1969, and United States President [[Richard Nixon]] decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Dallek|Dallek, Robert]] (2007), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain advantage over the Soviets as well.

In February 1972, Nixon achieved a stunning rapprochement with China,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=149–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; traveling to Beijing and meeting with [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]]. At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the United States; meanwhile, the [[Vietnam War]] both weakened America's influence in the Third World and cooled relations with Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease.&lt;ref name="Palmowski" /&gt;

===Nixon, Brezhnev, and détente===

[[File:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] sign the SALT II treaty, 18 June 1979, in [[Vienna]]]]

Following his visit to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, including Brezhnev in Moscow.&lt;ref name="bbc-nb"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/22/newsid_4373000/4373149.stm|title=President Nixon arrives in Moscow|publisher=BBC News|date=22 May 1972|accessdate=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: [[SALT I]], the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.&lt;ref name="Karabell" /&gt;

Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful coexistence" and established the groundbreaking new policy of ''[[détente]]'' (or cooperation) between the two superpowers. Meanwhile, Brezhnev attempted to revive the Soviet economy, which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures. Between 1972 and 1974, the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties,&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993" /&gt; including agreements for increased trade. As a result of their meetings, ''détente'' would replace the hostility of the Cold War and the two countries would live mutually.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Litwak, ''Détente and the Nixon doctrine: American foreign policy and the pursuit of stability, 1969–1976'' (Cambridge UP, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments coincided with the "[[Ostpolitik]]" policy of West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]],&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 154"/&gt; an effort to normalize relations between West Germany and Eastern Europe. Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe, culminating in the [[Helsinki Accords]] signed at the [[Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1979_Iranian_Revolution.jpg|thumb|Iranian people protesting against the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], during the [[Iranian Revolution]]]]

Kissinger and Nixon were "realists" who deemphasized idealistic goals like anti-communism or promotion of democracy worldwide, because those goals were too expensive in terms of America's economic capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Caldwell, "The legitimation of the Nixon-Kissinger grand design and grand strategy." ''Diplomatic History'' 33.4 (2009): 633-652.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a Cold War they wanted peace, trade and cultural exchanges. They realized that Americans were no longer willing to tax themselves for idealistic foreign policy goals, especially for containment policies that never seemed to produce positive results. Instead Nixon and Kissinger sought to downsize America's global commitments in proportion to its reduced economic, moral and political power. They rejected "idealism" as impractical and too expensive, and neither man showed much sensitivity to the plight of people living under Communism. Kissinger's realism fell out of fashion as idealism returned to American foreign policy with Carter's moralism emphasizing human rights, and Reagan's rollback strategy aimed at destroying Communism.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Schwartz, "Henry Kissinger: Realism, domestic politics, and the struggle against exceptionalism in American foreign policy." Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft 22.1 (2011): 121-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1970s deterioration of relations===
In the 1970s, the KGB, led by [[Yuri Andropov]], continued to persecute distinguished Soviet personalities such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]], who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of détente in the Third World, particularly during political crises in the Middle East, Chile, Ethiopia, and Angola.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although President [[Jimmy Carter]] tried to place another limit on the arms race with a [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] agreement in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/18/newsid_4508000/4508409.stm|title=Leaders agree arms reduction treaty|publisher=BBC News|date=18 June 2008|accessdate=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; his efforts were undermined by the other events that year, including the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]], which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.&lt;ref name="Lafeber 1993" /&gt;

Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] waged by guerrilla [[mujahideen]] against government forces countrywide.&lt;ref name="hussain"/&gt; The [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen]] insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring [[Pakistan]] and [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Starr|2004|pp=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;{{Harvnb|Warren|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government.&lt;ref name="hussain"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hussain|2005|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA—the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]]—resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup. By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to assist the mujahideen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meher|2004|pp=68–69, 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1979, Khalqist President [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member [[Hafizullah Amin]], who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's [[Babrak Karmal]] but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kalinovsky|2011|pp=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter responded to the Soviet intervention by withdrawing the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] treaty from the [[United States Senate|Senate]], imposing embargoes on grain and technology shipments to the USSR, and demanding a significant increase in military spending, and further announced that the United States would [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]]. He described the Soviet incursion as "the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, [[Ronald Reagan]] bluntly stated, in a conversation with [[Richard V. Allen]], his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," he said. "It is this: We win and they lose.

Moscow had built up a military that consumed as much as 25&amp;nbsp;percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product at the expense of [[consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] and investment in civilian sectors.&lt;ref name="LaFeber 2002, p. 332"&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet spending on the [[arms race]] and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Towle |first1=Philip |title=The Oxford History of Modern War |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw at least [[Era of Stagnation|a decade of economic stagnation]] during the late Brezhnev years.

Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but in large part by the interests of [[nomenklatura|massive party and state bureaucracies]] dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Armed Forces]] became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their [[military–industrial complex|military–industrial base]].&lt;ref name="Odom"&gt;{{Harvnb|Odom|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] demonstrated how the [[Vehicle armour|armor]], [[Fire-control system|fire control systems]] and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the [[T-72]], were drastically inferior to the American [[M1 Abrams]], yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-02-07/news/9201120109_1_soviet-report-reconnaissance-strike-military-force|title=Desert Storm Filled Soviet Military With Awe|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2017-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Carliner|editor1-first=Geoffrey |editor2-last=Alesina |editor2-first=Alberto |title=Politics and Economics in the Eighties |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1991 |page=6 |isbn=0-226-01281-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=Boston.com|accessdate=28 May 2014|date=29 March 2006|title=Caspar W.

Tensions continued intensifying in the early 1980s when Reagan revived the [[B-1 Lancer]] program that was canceled by the Carter administration, produced [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/icbm/lgm-118.htm|title=LGM-118A Peacekeeper|accessdate=10 April 2007|date=15 August 2000|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; installed US cruise missiles in Europe, and announced his experimental [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], dubbed "Star Wars" by the media, a defense program to shoot down missiles in mid-flight.&lt;ref name="ShieldSpace?"&gt;Lakoff, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

With the background of a buildup in tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the deployment of Soviet [[RSD-10 Pioneer]] [[ballistic missile]]s targeting Western Europe, NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy [[MGM-31 Pershing]] and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deployment would have placed missiles just 10&amp;nbsp;minutes' striking distance from Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Garthoff, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Soviets incurred high costs for their own foreign interventions. Although Brezhnev was convinced in 1979 that the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet war in Afghanistan]] would be brief, Muslim guerrillas, aided by the US, China, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan,&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt; waged a fierce resistance against the invasion.&lt;ref name="LaFeber314"&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kremlin sent nearly 100,000 troops to support its puppet regime in Afghanistan, leading many outside observers to dub the war "the Soviets' Vietnam".&lt;ref name="LaFeber314" /&gt; However, Moscow's quagmire in Afghanistan was far more disastrous for the Soviets than Vietnam had been for the Americans because the conflict coincided with a period of internal decay and domestic crisis in the Soviet system.

A senior [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] official predicted such an outcome as early as 1980, positing that the invasion resulted in part from a "domestic crisis within the Soviet {{nowrap|system. ...

By the time the comparatively youthful [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] in 1985,&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 197"/&gt; the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="LaFeber331" /&gt; These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.&lt;ref name="LaFeber331"&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|pp=331–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called ''[[perestroika]]'', or restructuring.&lt;ref name="Gaddis231"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|pp=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perestroika relaxed the [[production quota]] system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.&lt;ref name="Gaddis231" /&gt;

Despite initial skepticism in the West, the new Soviet leader proved to be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West.&lt;ref name="Palmowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaFeber2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|pp=300–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced ''[[glasnost]]'', or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1999|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Glasnost'' was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the [[Communist party|Communist Party]] and moderate the [[abuse of power]] in the [[Central Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1999|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating [[détente]] between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1999|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1989, the Soviet alliance system was on the brink of collapse, and, deprived of Soviet military support, the communist leaders of the [[Warsaw Pact]] states were losing power.&lt;ref name="Gaddis 2005, pp. 235–236"/&gt; Grassroots organizations, such as [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]'s [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases. In 1989, the communist governments in Poland and [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] became the first to negotiate the organizing of competitive elections. In [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[East Germany]], mass protests unseated entrenched communist leaders. The [[Communist state|communist regimes]] in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] also crumbled, in the latter case as the result of a [[Romanian Revolution|violent uprising]]. Attitudes had changed enough that US Secretary of State [[James Baker]] suggested that the American government would not be opposed to Soviet intervention in Romania, on behalf of the opposition, to prevent bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond L. Garthoff|Garthoff, Raymond L.]] "The Great Transition: American-Soviet Relations and the End of the Cold War" (Washington: Brookings Institution, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The tidal wave of change culminated with the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which symbolized the collapse of European communist governments and graphically ended the [[Iron Curtain]] divide of Europe. The [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 revolutionary wave]] swept across Central and Eastern Europe and peacefully overthrew all of the Soviet-style communist states: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lefeber|Fitzmaurice|Vierdag|1991|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romania was the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USSR itself, ''glasnost'' weakened the bonds that held the Soviet Union together&lt;ref name="Gaddis248" /&gt; and by February 1990, with the dissolution of the USSR looming, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] was forced to surrender its 73-year-old monopoly on state power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sakwa|1999|p=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time freedom of press and dissent allowed by ''glasnost'' and the festering "nationalities question" increasingly led the Union's component republics to declare their autonomy from Moscow, with the [[Baltic states]] withdrawing from the Union entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorbachev's permissive attitude toward Central and Eastern Europe did not initially extend to Soviet territory; even Bush, who strove to maintain friendly relations, condemned the January 1991 killings in [[The Barricades|Latvia]] and [[January Events (Lithuania)|Lithuania]], privately warning that economic ties would be frozen if the violence continued.&lt;ref&gt;Goldgeier, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The USSR was fatally weakened by a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] and a growing number of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], particularly [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], who threatened to secede from the USSR. The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], created on 21 December 1991, is viewed as a successor entity to the [[Soviet Union]] but, according to Russia's leaders, its purpose was to "allow a civilized divorce" between the Soviet Republics and is comparable to a loose [[confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/12/14b6b499-9eb2-4dee-b96c-784ec918969a.html Soviet Leaders Recall 'Inevitable' Breakup Of Soviet Union], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 8 December 2006.

US President at that time, [[George H. W. Bush]], expressed his emotions: "The biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the Cold War."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Stephen E., Ambrose &amp; Douglas G., Brinkley, ''Rise to Globalism: American Foreign Policy since 1938'', (New York: Penguin Books, 1997), p XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumulative U.S. military expenditures throughout the entire Cold War amounted to an estimated $8&amp;nbsp;trillion. Further nearly 100,000 Americans lost their lives in the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Soviet casualties are difficult to estimate, as a share of their gross national product the financial cost for the Soviet Union was much higher than that incurred by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the aftermath of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of [[economic growth]] and an increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by [[failed state|state failure]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

During the Cold War itself, with the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence the hearts and minds of people around the world, especially using motion pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Shaw and Denise Youngblood, ''Cinematic Cold War: The American and Soviet struggle for hearts and minds'' (University Press of Kansas, 2010), ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected extensively in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with numerous post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television, and other media.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, ''[[The Americans (2013 TV series)|The Americans]]'', set in the early 1980s, was ranked #6 on the [[Metacritic]] annual Best New TV Shows list; its six-season run concluded in May 2018.&lt;ref name="metacritic-americans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/best-new-tv-shows-of-2013 |title=The Best New TV Shows of 2013 |publisher=Metacritic (CBS Interactive Inc.) |date=11 December 2013 |accessdate=14 April 2014 |author=Jason Dietz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/30/entertainment/the-americans-series-finale-review/index.html |title='The Americans' finale brings FX drama to tense, satisfying close|publisher=CNN |first=Brian |last=Lowry |date=31 May 2018 |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, movies like ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'' (1995) are shown in their entirety to educate college students about the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15512169.2013.835561 |title=Movies to the Rescue: Keeping the Cold War Relevant for Twenty-First-Century Students |author=Gokcek, Gigi &amp; Howard, Alison |journal=Journal of Political Science Education |year=2013 |volume=9 |issue=4 |page=436 |doi=10.1080/15512169.2013.835561|last2=Howard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography of the Cold War}}
{{Periods in US history}}
As soon as the term "Cold War" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists.&lt;ref name="Nashel"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Nashel, Jonathan|editor=Whiteclay Chambers, John|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to American Military History|title=Cold War (1945–91): Changing Interpretations (entire chapter)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtMKHgAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Oxford+Companion+to+American+Military+History|accessdate=16 June 2008|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-507198-0|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet–US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, or could have been avoided.&lt;ref name="Brinkley"&gt;Brinkley, pp. 798–799&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

Although explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse, several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified. Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War: "orthodox" accounts, "revisionism", and "post-revisionism".&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt;

"Orthodox" accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt; "Revisionist" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt; "Post-revisionists" see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt; Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories.&lt;ref name="Byrd" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5622">The '''Conseil Souverain of Navarre and Béarn''' (French: ''"Conseil Souverain de Navarre et de Béarn"'', alias ''"Conseil Souverain de Navarre"'' and ''"Conseil Souverain de Béarn"'') was created by [[Henry II of Navarre]]&lt;ref name="Laussat (1871), p. 166"&gt;Laussat (1871), p. 166 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34253p/f176.item.zoom (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Château de Pau]]&lt;ref name="Laussat (1871), p. 166" /&gt; on {{date|13 June 1519}},&lt;ref name="Laussat (1871), p. 166" /&gt; replacing the [[Cour Majour]] which was disbanded in {{date|1490}}.

It functioned as a ''Conseil d'État'' and was composed of counsellors ''(French: conseillers)'', a prosecutor general ''(French: procureur général)'', a criminal prosecutor ''(French: procureur criminel)'', an attorney general ''(French: avocat général)'', several second presidents ''(French: second présidents)'' and one first president ''(French: premier président)''. These offices were essentially bought and sold, often passed down during generations within the same families. The purchase, sale or transfer of the office required the ratification of the [[Chambre des Comptes of Navarre]] in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], who acted on behalf of the king.

In October&lt;ref name="Saget (1831)"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. Saget|title=Description du château de Pau et de ses dépendances|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_j25dmOSVQC&amp;pg=PA46|year=1831|publisher=E. Vignancour|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{date|1620}}, together with the [[Chancery of Navarre]] based in [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]], it was merged to form the [[Parliament of Navarre and Béarn]] ''("Parlement de Navarre et Béarn")'' in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]],&lt;ref name="Guyot (1784)"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Guyot (Joseph Nicolas)|title=Répertoire universel et raisonné de jurisprudence civile, criminelle, canonique et béneficiale: ouvrage de plusieurs jurisconsultes: mis en ordre &amp; publié|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iW5GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA592|year=1784|publisher=Visse|page=592}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it was renamed to the '''Conseil d'État de Navarre'''.

The registers of the ''Conseil Souverain of Navarre and Béarn'' for the period {{date|1547}} until {{date|1620}} are held ''Archives Départementales des Pyrénées-Atlantiques'' in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21040">This article is about the [[Chernobyl disaster]], which occurred on April 26, 1986, and was the world's largest nuclear accident.

==Literature==
* [[Markiyan Kamysh]]'s novel about [[Disaster tourism|Chernobyl illegal trips]] [http://markian.info/?page_id=1538 "A Stroll to the Zone"]. In France the novel has been released under the title “La Zone” and been welcomed with great warmth by French critics. Cult French magazine [[Le Nouvel observateur|Le Nouvel Observateur]] has called it “Stunning book”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/monde/20160425.OBS9213/tchernobyl-30-ans-apres-avec-un-stalker-de-la-zone.html|title=Tchernobyl 30 ans après : au coeur de la zone interdite|work=L'Obs|access-date=2017-10-02|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Monaco Hebdo]] magazine has included it in the list of choices of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monacohebdo.mc/16897-la-selection-de-mai|title=Culture Sélection de mai - Monaco Hebdo|date=2016-05-12|work=Monaco Hebdo|access-date=2017-10-02|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The disaster is the plot-driving device in the 1988 [[Marvel Comics]] miniseries ''Meltdown'', featuring [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]].
* [[Martin Cruz Smith]]'s 2005 novel, ''[[Wolves Eat Dogs]]'', is set mostly in Chernobyl, when Moscow detective [[Arkady Renko]] investigates the murder of a powerful businessman in that area, after the businessman's partner has died in Moscow of [[radiation poisoning]].  Both victims are found to have had some involvement with the accident, twenty years earlier.
* The novel [[Party Headquarters]] by Bulgarian author [[Georgi Tenev]] deals with Chernobyl impact on the integrity of the former Communist block in the late 80's. Large episode of the book is set as an exchange of letters between the protagonist and “little unknown Soviet and Ukrainian comrade” describing the catastrophe.
* The ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'' chose the term ''Chernobyl'' ({{lang-de|Tschernobyl}}) as [[Word of the year (Germany)|German Word of the Year]] 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l10/l0/F.html#featuredEntry][[Spiegel Online]]: ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!'' (in German) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315092041/http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l10/l0/F.html#featuredEntry |date=March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christa Wolf]]'s 1987 novel ''Accident'' (German: ''Störfall'') narrates, from the perspective of a female first-person narrator, the thoughts and events of the day on which the news about the Chernobyl accident have reached her and amounts to a criticism of utopian visions that ignore the human side of social progress.&lt;ref&gt;Arata Takeda (2015), "Towards global awareness of nuclear threat: Literary responses to nuclear disasters in Christa Wolf's ''Accident: A Day's News'' (1987) and Daniel de Roulet's ''You Didn't See Anything at Fukushima'' (2011)", in ''The Impact of Disaster: Social and Cultural Approaches to Fukushima and Chernobyl'', eds. Thomas M. Bohn, Thomas Feldhoff, Lisette Gebhardt, and Arndt Graf (Berlin: EB-Publishers), pp. 195–214, here pp. 199–205.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1987 novel ''Chernobyl'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] tells about the disaster from the viewpoint of individuals involve in it.
* In 2004, photographer Elena Filatova published a photo-essay on her website of her solo motorcycle rides through Pripyat and the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,18825302-912,00.html|title=Nuclear ghosts shadow victims|last=Staff|date=2006-04-15|publisher=The Advertiser (Adelaide)|accessdate=2008-09-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was later revealed to be a [[hoax]],&lt;ref name="lat001"&gt;{{cite news|title=The World; Account of Chernobyl Trip Takes Web Surfers for a Ride|last=Mycio|first=Mary|date=2004-07-06|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2008-09-05|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/06/world/fg-chernobyl6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the photos taken while on a guided tour or taken uncredited from other sources.
* The 2007 short story "The Zero Meter Diving Team" by [[Jim Shepard]] is about the disaster. It is told in the first person by narrator Boris Yakovlevich Prushinsky, chief engineer of the Soviet Department of Nuclear Energy. The story first appeared in BOMB magazine and later appeared in Shepard's short story collection, "Like You'd Understand, Anyway" (2007), Vintage Books.
* Darragh McKeon's 2014 novel [[All That is Solid Melts into Air (novel)|All That is Solid Melts into Air]] uses the disaster as the backdrop for chronicling the end of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://nyti.ms/1sFivr9{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''[[Mort and Phil]]'' album ''[[Chernobil... ¡Qué cuchitril!]]'' the titular characters have to investigate mysterious things happening in Chernobyl 25 years after the disaster.
* In ''[[The Fall (del Toro and Hogan novel)|The Fall]]'' by [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Chuck Hogan]], the second volume of their ''[[The Strain]]'' trilogy, corrupt businessman Eldritch Palmer meets with "The Master", the leader of the rogue [[vampires]], in Pripyat, to plan the vampires' takeover of the world.  In the first volume, ''The Strain'', Professor Abraham Setrakian explains that the Master is naturally drawn to the sites of humanity's greatest disasters and atrocities.

==Music==
* [[David Bowie]]'s 1987 song "[[Time Will Crawl]]" was inspired by the disaster.
* [[Paul Simon]]'s 1990 song "Can't Run But," found on [[Rhythm of the Saints]] contains references to the disaster.
* Polish singer [[Jacek Kaczmarski]] wrote a song titled "Dzień Gniewu II (Czarnobyl)" (''Day of Wrath II (Chernobyl)'', written in May 1986 and released a year later), about the day of the disaster in Pripyat, its citizens unaware of the unfolding tragedy. The song juxtaposes calm, ballada-like music with the perspective of imminent death (such as ''"Around the well in the backyard / wet, smiley faces / a child chases wheel / it is being killed as well"''), serving as a [[protest song]] against the Soviet handling of the disaster and the secrecy that surrounded it.
* English heavy metal band [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] describe their personal experiences of the disaster in the track "Red Alert" on their 1988 album, [[Destiny (Saxon album)|Destiny]].
* The Japanese punk band [[The Blue Hearts]]' song "Chernobyl", on their 1988 single "[[Blue Hearts Theme]]", was written in protest of nuclear power. The band's record label at the time had ties to the nuclear industry, thus the group left the label to release the song.
* "Mayday in Kiev", a song by [[Watchtower (band)|Watchtower]] on their 1989 album ''[[Control and Resistance]]''. The song title is a pun on the [[May Day]] celebrations, which were held in the Ukrainian capital [[Kiev]] only days after the explosion as if nothing had happened, and the emergency signal [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]].
* The German electronic band [[Kraftwerk]] mentions Chernobyl at the beginning of their 1991 remix of their song "[[Radioactivity (song)|Radioactivity]]", released on the album ''[[The Mix (Kraftwerk album)|The Mix]]''. Chernobyl is mentioned along with other places of nuclear incidents and accidents, such as [[Three Mile Island accident|Harrisburg]], [[Windscale fire|Sellafield]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]]. The names were included in the remix of the song because some critics had found the original version of the song to be too optimistic towards nuclear energy.
* Canadian composer Larysa Kuzmenko composed the piano piece "In memoriam: to the Victims of Chernobyl" in 1997. Within the piece is represented, by musical motives, the explosions, the radioactive particles, and a chant for the dead.
* The music video for the 2007 song "[[What We Made]]" by British rapper [[Example (rapper)|Example]] is shot on location at [[Pripyat, Ukraine|Pripyat]], focusing on some parts of the city that has been greatly affected by the disaster.
* The song "Spam" by the band [[Save Ferris]] claims that the product is made in Chernobyl, to rhyme with the line, "It's pink and it's oval."

{{main|Murder of Stephen Lawrence}}

Following the murder of their son Stephen in 1993, Doreen and Neville Lawrence claimed that the [[Metropolitan Police]] investigation was not being conducted in a professional manner, citing incompetence and racism as prime flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/110842.stm|title=Lawrence mother calls police 'racist'|publisher=BBC News|date= 11 June 1998|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, after years of campaigning, and with the support of many in the community, the media&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/18/world/racial-killing-bursts-a-british-press-taboo.html Warren Hoge, "Racial Killing Bursts a British Press Taboo", ''New York Times'', 18 February 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt; and politics, a wide-ranging judicial inquiry was established by [[Jack Straw]], the [[Home Secretary]]. Chaired by [[William Macpherson (judge)|Sir William MacPherson]], the inquiry was to investigate the circumstances of Stephen Lawrence's death. The public inquiry was the subject of intense media interest which became international when it concluded that the Metropolitan Police was "[[Institutional Racism|institutionally racist]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/4262.htm|title=The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry|publisher=Archive.official-documents.co.uk|date=24 February 1999|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this was one of the primary causes of their failure to solve the case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3849">'''Emma Adelaide Hahn''' (April 1, 1893 – July 8, 1967) was an American linguist and classicist who specialized in Latin grammar and Indo-European linguistics. She served as chair of the [[Hunter College]] Classics department for twenty-seven years and was the first woman to serve as president of the [[Linguistic Society of America]].

==Biography==

Hahn was born in [[New York City]] to Otto Hahn, an immigrant from Austria, and Elenore (Funk) Hahn. She attended [[Hunter College High School]] and then [[Hunter College]], where she received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1915 with a Latin major and Greek minor. Her graduate work in classics was at [[Columbia University]], where she received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1917 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1929.&lt;ref name=Lane&gt;{{cite journal |first=George S. |last=Lane |date=December 1967 |title=E. Adelaide Hahn |jstor=411976 |journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]] |publisher=[[Linguistic Society of America]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=958–964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her dissertation, supervised by [[Charles Knapp (scholar)|Charles Knapp]], was on grammatical elements in the writing of [[Virgil]].&lt;ref name=CAAS&gt;{{cite web |first=Judith P. |last=Hallett |date=October 2007 |title=Emma Adelaide Hahn (1893-1967) |publisher=Classical Association of the Atlantic States |url=http://www.caas-cw.org/archive/hahnbio.html |accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Columbia, she enrolled in a course by [[Edgar Howard Sturtevant]] in comparative grammar of Greek and Latin. Sturtevant sparked Hahn's interest in Indo-European linguistics (particularly [[Hittite language|Hittite]]), which she continued to study at the LSA's summer Linguistic Institute. After Sturtevant joined the faculty at [[Yale University]], she attended linguistic seminars at Yale taught by [[Leonard Bloomfield]], [[Franklin Edgerton]], [[Albrecht Goetze]], [[Eduard Prokosch]], and [[Edward Sapir]].&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt;

At Hunter, after joining the classics faculty in 1921, Hahn became an assistant professor in 1925, an associate professor in 1933, and a full professor in 1936.&lt;ref name=CAAS/&gt; She became the chair of the classics department in 1936 and continued in this position until her retirement in 1963.&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt;

For the [[Linguistic Society of America]], she served as a member of the Executive Committee from 1930 to 1934, as vice-president in 1940, and as president in 1946.&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt; She was the first woman to serve as LSA president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presidents |url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/about/who-we-are/presidents |publisher=[[Linguistic Society of America]] |accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also president of the New York Classical Club from 1939 to 1941, vice-president of the [[American Oriental Society]] from 1952 to 1953, and president of the Classical Association of the Atlantic States from 1960 to 1962.&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt;

Hahn's distinctive New York accent, forceful way of speaking, and penchant for large feathered hats earned her a reputation as a “character,” a colorful and unforgettable personality.&lt;ref name=CAAS/&gt;

Hahn died in New York City in 1967.&lt;ref name=CAAS/&gt;

'''Edvard Freydar Beyer''' (6 October 1920 &amp;ndash; 10 November 2003) was a Norwegian [[literary history|literary historian]], [[literary critic]], and professor at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1958 to 1990.

==Early and personal life==
Beyer was born in [[Haugesund]] and grew up in [[Bergen]], as a son of literary historian, later professor [[Harald Beyer (literary historian)|Harald Beyer]] (1891&amp;ndash;1960), and Eidis Johannessen (1893&amp;ndash;1977). He was married to nurse Aslaug Ryssdal from 1946.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Edvard Beyer |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|first=Atle |last=Kittang|authorlink=Atle Kittang|year=1999|volume=1|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Edvard_Beyer/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Beyer studied [[philology]], and graduated with the dissertation ''Livsgleden som problem i Ibsens diktning'', which was published in the journal ''[[Edda. Scandinavian Journal of Literary Research|Edda]]'' in 1948. The next ten years he worked as an independent literary critic for [[Bergens Tidende]], and eventually as a lecturer at the [[University of Bergen]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He took his [[dr.philos.]] degree in 1956, with the thesis ''Hans E. Kinck; livsangst og livstro'' (about [[Hans E. Kinck]], issued in two volumes, in 1956 and 1965). His doctorate thesis is regarded as his most important research work.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Edvard Freydar Beyer|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor=Henriksen, Petter |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo  |url=http://www.snl.no/Edvard_Freydar_Beyer |language=Norwegian | accessdate=10 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as one of the most voluminous monographies on a poet in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edvard Beyer (obituary)|last=Nettum|first=Rolf Nyboe|authorlink=Rolf Nyboe Nettum|date=25 November 2003|work=Aftenposten|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyer was appointed professor in [[Nordic literature]] at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1958, succeeding [[Francis Bull]]. He also took over Bull's position as editor-in-chief of ''Edda'', from 1962 to 1972. He was main editor for ''Norges litteraturhistorie'' (six volumes, 1974&amp;ndash;1975), where he also wrote volume three and part of volume two, on literature from the 1800s. He was the Norwegian editor for the Scandinavian project ''Verdens litteraturhistorie'' (twelve volumes, 1971&amp;ndash;1974). During the 1980s Beyer administered and contributed to the project ''Norsk litteraturkritikks historie 1770–1940'', the history of Norwegian literary criticism from 1770 to 1940. He edited the collected works of Hans E. Kinck (18 volumes), and the short story anthologies ''Perler i prosa'' (1966) and ''Norske noveller'' (1967).&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Beyer was chairman of [[Arts Council Norway]] from 1978 to 1985. He was a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] from 1959. He retired as a professor in 1990.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; In the same year he received the [[Fritt Ord Honorary Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fritt-ord.no/no/priser/category/fritt_ords_honnor/|title=Priser – Fritt Ords Honnør|publisher=[[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in November 2003 in [[Bærum]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

The '''''Epigoni''''' ({{lang-grc|Ἐπίγονοι}}, ''Epigonoi'', "progeny") is an ancient [[Greek tragedy]] written by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwright [[Sophocles]] in the 5th century BC and based on [[Greek mythology]].

According to myth, [[Polynices]] and six allies (the [[seven against Thebes]]) attacked [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] because Polynices' brother, [[Eteocles]], refused to give up the throne as promised.  All but one ([[Adrastus]]) of the seven would-be conquerors were killed.  Their children swore vengeance and attacked Thebes.  This was called the war of the [[Epigoni|Epigonoi]] ("the offspring, the next generation"); the story had been told, before Sophocles, in the lost [[Cyclic poets|epic]] ''[[Epigoni (epic)|Epigonoi]]''. These Epigonoi defeated and killed (or drove out) [[Laodamas]], son of Eteocles, and conquered Thebes, installing [[Thersander]] on the throne.  All of the Epigonoi but [[Aegialeus (king of Argos)|Aegialeus]], the son of [[Adrastus]], or else [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]], son of [[Amphiaraus]], survived this battle.

[[Amphiaraus]] had known that the attack against Thebes was doomed to fail and had not wanted to partake, but was coerced to do so by his wife [[Eriphyle]], who had been bribed by Polynices.  Amphiaraus had instructed his son Alcmaeon to avenge him against his mother, and Alcmaeon killed her, either before or after the war of the Epigonoi, depending on the version of the myth.&lt;ref name=fragments&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles Fragments|author=[[Sophocles]]|others=[[Hugh Lloyd-Jones|Lloyd Jones, H.]], translator and editor |pages=42–47, 72–81|year=1996|publisher=Harvard College|isbn=0-674-99532-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alcmaeon was then pursued by the [[Erinyes]], similar to the fate of [[Orestes]] after killing his mother [[Clytemnestra]].&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles: Electra|author=Kells, J.H.|chapter=Introduction|page=1|year=1973|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-09796-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Companion to Classical Literature|pages=23–24|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-282708-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was lost for centuries, except for a few fragments, but in April 2005, [[classicist]]s at [[Oxford University]], employing [[infrared]] technology previously used for [[satellite]] imaging, discovered additional fragments of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/a-second-renaissance-5345162.html |title= A second renaissance? |work= The Independent |date= 2005-04-17| access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=David Keys and Nicholas Pyke |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/decoded-at-last-the-classical-holy-grail-that-may-rewrite-the-history-of-the-world-2031.html |title= Decoded At Last: The 'Classical Holy Grail' |work=The Independent |date=2005-04-19 |access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragment translates to the following:

:'''''Speaker A:''' … gobbling the whole, sharpening the flashing iron.''
:'''''Speaker B:''' And the helmets are shaking their purple-dyed crests, and for the wearers of breast-plates the weavers are striking up the wise shuttle's songs, that wakes up those who are asleep.''
:'''''Speaker A:''' And he is gluing together the chariot's rail.''

Several fragments had been definitively assigned to ''Epigoni'' prior to this find.  One was translated by [[Hugh Lloyd-Jones]] as "Most calamitous of sons, what a word have you uttered."&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  This was apparently stated by  Eriphyle to Alcmaeon shortly before he killed her.&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  Another fragment has a similar theme: "O woman whose shamelessness has stopped at nothing and has gone yet further, no other evil is or ever will be worse than a woman who was born to give pain to mortals."&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;

Another fragment presents an exchange between Alcmaeon and Adrastus, Eriphyle's brother and thus Alcmaeon's uncle.&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  In this exchange Alcmaeon remarks that Adrastus "is the brother of a woman who killed her husband."&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  Adrastus retorts by accusing Alcmaeon of murdering "the mother who gave [him] birth."&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  A remark in [[Philodemus]]' book about music leads scholars to believe that the dispute between Alcmaeon and Adrastus was somehow resolved through the power of music.&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;

Another fragment posits the view that "for victims of envy find that ill repute wins out over shameful rather than over honorable actions."&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  And an additional fragment notes that someone (unnamed in the fragment) will no longer live in [[Argos]].&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;

In addition to the fragments assigned to ''Epigoni'', there are seven extant fragments assigned to a Sophocles play entitled ''Eriphyle''.  Many scholars believe that ''Eriphyle'' is just an alternate title for ''Epigoni'', in which case these seven fragments would apply to ''Epigoni''.&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  These fragments include such advice as (again as translated by Lloyd-Jones) "Maintain restraint in speech, as is proper to old age," and "The only possessions that are permanent are those of excellence."&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;  However, it is possible that ''Eriphyle'' is a separate play from ''Epigoni'', in which case it is possible that both were part of a connected trilogy, with the other tragic play in the trilogy being ''Alcmaeon'' and the [[satyr play]] being ''[[Amphiaraus (play)|Amphiaraus]]''.&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;

There are other fragments that may belong to ''Epigoni'' but are uncertain.  For example, a one sentence fragment of Sophocles (fragment 958) telling of the death of [[Amphiaraus]] &amp;ndash; that the ground of Thebes opened up to receive him and his arms and his horses and chariot &amp;ndash; has been variously assigned to ''Epigoni'', ''Eriphyle'', ''Alcmaeon'' or to ''Amphiaraus''.&lt;ref name=fragments/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fragments of Sophocles|author=[[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|Jebb, R.C]], Headlam, W.G. &amp; [[Alfred Chilton Pearson|Pearson, A.C.]]|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fnM0QOxupIQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=Amphiaraus+sophocles+fragment&amp;ots=ZkGYXitYt7&amp;sig=Sy86qBCrzh5mjZZhtaM8FJ81DR8#v=snippet&amp;q=Amphiaraus%20%20&amp;f=false|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1917|isbn=978-1-108-00988-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{post-nominals|list=[[The Honorable|The Hon.]] [[Doctor (title)|Dr.]]}} '''Eric Eustace Williams''' {{post-nominal|list=[[Trinity Cross|TC]] [[Companion of Honour|CH]]}} (25 September 1911 – 29 March 1981) served as the first [[List of Prime Ministers of Trinidad and Tobago|Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago]]. He served as prime minister from 1962 until his death in 1981. He was also a noted [[Caribbean]] historian, and is widely regarded as ''[[Father of the Nation|The Father of the Nation]]''.

==Early life==
Dr. Williams was born on 25 September 1911. His father Thomas Henry Williams was a minor civil servant, and his mother Eliza Frances Boissiere (13 April 1888 – 1969) was a descendant of the mixed [[Creole people#Caribbean|French Creole]] elite. He saw his first school years at Tranquillity Boys' Intermediate Government School and he was later educated at [[Queen's Royal College]] in [[Port of Spain]], where he excelled at academics and football. A football injury at QRC led to a hearing problem which he wore a hearing aid to correct.  He won an island [[scholarship]] in 1932, which allowed him to attend St Catherine's Society, Oxford (which subsequently became [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]]). In 1935, he received first-class honours for his B.A in history, and was ranked in first place among [[University of Oxford]] students graduating in History in 1935. He also represented the university at football. In 1938 he went on to obtain his doctorate (see section below). In ''Inward Hunger'', his autobiography, he described his experience of racism in [[Great Britain]], and the impact on him of his travels in [[Germany]] after the [[Nazi]] seizure of power.

==Scholarly career==
In ''Inward Hunger'', Williams recounts that in the period following his graduation: "I was severely handicapped in my research by my lack of money.... I was turned down everywhere I tried ... and could not ignore the racial factor involved". However, in 1936, thanks to a recommendation made by Sir [[Alfred Claud Hollis]] (Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, 1930–36), the [[Leathersellers' Company]] awarded him a £50 grant to continue his advanced research in history at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;The Leathersellers' Company Court Minutes, 1 July 1936, ref. GOV/1/25, pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]] in 1938 under the supervision of [[Vincent Harlow]]. His doctoral thesis was titled ''The Economic Aspects of the Abolition of the Slave Trade and West Indian Slavery'', and was published as ''[[Capitalism and Slavery]]'' in 1944. It was both a direct attack on the idea that moral and humanitarian motives were the key facts in the victory of British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionism]], and a covert critique of the idea common in the 1930s, emanating in particular from the pen of Oxford Professor [[Reginald Coupland]], that [[British imperialism]] was essentially propelled by humanitarian and benevolent impulses. Williams's argument owed much to the influence of [[C. L. R. James]], whose ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'', also completed in 1938, also offered an economic and geostrategic explanation for the rise of British abolitionism.

Gad Heuman states:
:In ''Capitalism and Slavery,'' Eric Williams argued that the declining economies of the British West Indies led to the abolition of the slave trade and of slavery. More recent research has rejected this conclusion; it is now clear that the colonies of the British Caribbean profited considerably during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Gad Heuman "The British West Indies"  in Andrew Porter, ed., ''The Oxford History of the British Empire – Vol. 3: The 19th Century'' (1999) 3:470&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shift to public life==
In 1944, Dr. Williams was appointed to the [[Anglo-American Caribbean Commission]]. In 1948 he returned to Trinidad as the Commission's Deputy Chairman of the Caribbean Research Council. In Trinidad, he delivered a series of educational lectures, for which he became famous. In 1955 after disagreements between Dr. Williams and the Commission, the Commission elected not to renew his contract. In a famous speech at Woodford Square in Port of Spain, he declared that he had decided to "put down his bucket" in the land of his birth. He rechristened that enclosed park, which stood in front of the Trinidad courts and legislature, "The University of Woodford Square", and proceeded to give a series of public lectures on world history, Greek democracy and philosophy, the history of slavery, and the history of the Caribbean to large audiences drawn from every social class.

===Entry into nationalist politics in Trinidad and Tobago===
From that public platform, Williams on 15 January 1956 inaugurated his own political party, the [[People's National Movement]] (PNM), which would take Trinidad and Tobago into independence in 1962, and dominate its post-colonial politics. Until this time his lectures had been carried out under the auspices of the Political Education Movement, a branch of the Teachers Education and Cultural Association, a group that had been founded in the 1940s as an alternative to the official teachers' union. The PNM's first document was its [[constitution]].  Unlike the other political parties of the time, the PNM was a highly organized, hierarchical body. Its second document was The People's Charter, in which the party strove to separate itself from the transitory political assemblages which had thus far been the norm in Trinidadian politics.

In elections held eight months later, on 24 September the Peoples National Movement won 13 of the 24 elected seats in the [[Legislative Council]], defeating 6 of the 16 incumbents running for re-election. Although the PNM did not secure a majority in the 31-member Legislative Council, he was able to convince the Secretary of State for the Colonies to allow him to name the five appointed members of the council (despite the opposition of the [[Governor of Trinidad and Tobago|Governor]], [[Edward Beetham|Sir Edward Betham Beetham]]). This gave him a clear majority in the Legislative Council. Williams was thus elected Chief Minister and was also able to get all seven of his ministers elected.

===Federation and independence===
After the [[Second World War]], the British [[Colonial Office]] had preferred that colonies move towards political independence in the kind of federal systems which had appeared to succeed since the [[Confederation of Canada]], which created the [[Dominion of Canada]], in the 19th century. In the [[British West Indies]] this goal coincided with the political aims of the nationalist movements which had emerged in all the colonies of the region during the 1930s. The Montego Bay conference of 1948 had declared the common aim to be the achievement by the West Indies of "Dominion Status" (which meant constitutional independence from Britain) as a Federation. In 1958, a [[West Indies Federation]] emerged from the [[British West Indies]], which with [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]) and [[British Honduras]] (now [[Belize]]) choosing to opt out of the Federation, left [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] as the dominant players. Most political parties in the various territories aligned themselves into one of two Federal political parties – the [[West Indies Federal Labour Party]] (led by [[Grantley Adams]] of Barbados and [[Norman Manley]] of Jamaica) and the [[Democratic Labour Party (West Indies Federation)|Democratic Labour Party]] (led by Manley's cousin, [[Alexander Bustamante|Sir Alexander Bustamante]]). The PNM affiliated with the former, while several opposition parties (the People's Democratic Party, the [[Trinidad Labour Party]] and the Party of Political Progress Groups) aligned themselves with the DLP, and soon merged to form the [[Democratic Labour Party (Trinidad and Tobago)|Democratic Labour Party of Trinidad and Tobago]].

The DLP victory in the [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#1958 Federal Elections|1958 Federal Elections]] and subsequent poor showing by the PNM in the [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#1959 County Council Elections|1959 County Council Elections]] soured Williams on the Federation. [[Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, 1st Baron Hailes|Lord Hailes]] ([[Governor-General]] of the Federation) also overruled two PNM nominations to the Federal Senate in order to balance a disproportionately WIFLP-dominated Senate. When Bustamante withdrew [[Jamaica]] from the Federation, this left Trinidad and Tobago in the untenable position of having to provide 75% of the Federal budget while having less than half the seats in the Federal government. In a famous speech, Williams declared that "one from ten leaves nought". Following the adoption of a resolution to that effect by the PNM General Council on 15 January 1962, Williams withdrew Trinidad and Tobago from the West Indies Federation. This action led the British government to dissolve the Federation.

In 1961 the PNM had introduced the ''Representation of the People Bill''. This Bill was designed to modernise the electoral system by instituting permanent registration of voters, identification cards, [[voting machines]] and revised electoral boundaries. These changes were seen by the DLP as an attempt to disenfranchise illiterate rural voters through intimidation, to rig the elections through the use of voting machines, to allow [[Afro-Caribbean]] immigrants from other islands to vote, and to [[gerrymander]] the boundaries to ensure victory by the PNM. Opponents of the PNM saw "proof" of these allegations when [[A. N. R. Robinson]] was declared winner of the [[Tobago]] seat in 1961 with more votes than there were registered voters, and in the fact that the PNM was able to win every subsequent election until the [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#1980 Tobago House of Assembly Elections|1980 Tobago House of Assembly Elections]].

The [[Elections in Trinidad and Tobago#1961 General Elections|1961 elections]] gave the PNM 57% of the votes and 20 of the 30 seats. This two-thirds majority allowed them to draft the Independence [[Constitution]] without input from the DLP.  Although supported by the Colonial Office, independence was blocked by the DLP, until Williams was able to make a deal with DLP leader [[Rudranath Capildeo]] that strengthened the rights of the minority party and expanded the number of Opposition [[Senate of Trinidad and Tobago|Senators]]. With Capildeo's assent, Trinidad and Tobago became independent on 31 August 1962, 25 days after Jamaica.

===Black Power===
Between 1968 and 1970 the [[Black Power]] movement gained strength in Trinidad and Tobago. The leadership of the movement developed within the Guild of Undergraduates at the [[Saint Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago|St. Augustine]] Campus of the [[University of the West Indies]]. Led by [[Geddes Granger]], the [[National Joint Action Committee]] joined up with [[Trade Union|trade unionists]] led by George Weekes of the [[Oilfields Workers' Trade Union]] and [[Basdeo Panday]], then a young trade-union [[lawyer]] and activist. The [[Black Power Revolution]] started during the 1970 [[Carnival]]. In response to the challenge, Williams countered with a broadcast entitled "I am for Black Power". He introduced a 5% levy to fund unemployment reduction and established the first locally owned commercial bank. However, this intervention had little impact on the protests.

On 3 April 1970 a protester was killed by the police.  This was followed on 13 April by the resignation of [[A. N. R. Robinson]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Tobago]] East.  On 18 April sugar workers went on strike, and there was talk of a general strike. In response to this, Williams proclaimed a [[State of Emergency]] on 21 April and arrested fifteen Black Power leaders. In response to this, a portion of the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force, led by [[Raffique Shah]] and [[Rex Lassalle]], mutinied and took hostages at the army barracks at [[Teteron]]. Through the action of the [[Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard]] the mutiny was contained and the mutineers surrendered on 25 April.

Williams made three additional speeches in which he sought to identify himself with the aims of the Black Power movement. He re-shuffled his cabinet and removed three ministers (including two [[White people|White]] members) and three senators. He also proposed a Public Order Bill which would have curtailed civil liberties in an effort to control protest marches. After public opposition, led by A. N. R. Robinson and his newly created Action Committee of Democratic Citizens (which later became the [[Democratic Action Congress]]), the Bill was withdrawn. [[Attorney General]] [[Karl Hudson-Phillips]] offered to resign over the failure of the Bill, but Williams refused his resignation.

===Academic contributions===
Williams specialised in the study of [[slavery]]. Many Western academics focus on his chapter on the abolition of the [[slave trade]], but that is just a small part of his work. In 1944 his book ''[[Capitalism and Slavery]]'' argued that the British abolition of their Atlantic [[slave trade]] in 1807 was motivated primarily by economics—rather than by altruism or humanitarianism. By extension, so was the emancipation of the slaves and the fight against the trading in slaves by other nations. As industrial capitalism and wage labour began to expand, eliminating the competition from slavery became economically advantageous.

Indeed, Williams' impact on the field of study has proved of lasting significance. As [[Barbara Solow]] and [[Stanley Engerman]] put it in the preface to a compilation of essays on Williams that was based on a commemorative symposium held in Italy in 1984, Williams "defined the study of Caribbean history, and its writing affected the course of Caribbean history.... Scholars may disagree on his ideas, but they remain the starting point of discussion.... Any conference on British capitalism and Caribbean slavery is a conference on Eric Williams."

In an open letter to Solow, Yale Professor of History [[David Brion Davis]] refers to Williams' thesis of the declining economic viability of slave labor as "undermined by a vast mountain of empirical evidence and has been repudiated by the world’s leading authorities on New World slavery, the transatlantic slave trade, and the British abolition movement." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/01/12/british-slave-trade/|title=The British &amp; the Slave Trade|first1=David Brion|last1=Davis|first2=Barbara L.|last2=Solow|date=18 November 2017|publisher=|via=www.nybooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main evidence provided to refute the Eric Williams thesis was in Seymour Drescher's ''Econocide'', which argued that when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, Britain's sugar economy was thriving. However, Drescher ends his study of the British Caribbean in 1822, and does not address the decline of the British sugar industry highlighted by Williams, which began in the mid-1820s, and continued until the emancipation of the slaves in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Drescher, ''Econocide: British Slavery in the Era of Abolition'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the Eric Williams thesis, which addresses the decline of the sugar industry in the 1820s, the emancipation of the slaves in the 1830s, and the sugar equalisation acts of the 1840s, has not been refuted or undermined.

In addition to ''Capitalism and Slavery'', Williams produced a number of other scholarly works focused on the Caribbean. Of particular significance are two published long after he had abandoned his academic career for public life: ''British Historians and the West Indies'' and ''From [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]''. The former, based on research done in the 1940s and initially presented at a symposium at [[Atlanta University]], sought to debunk British historiography on the region and to condemn as racist the 19th- and early 20th-century British perspective on the West Indies. Williams was particularly scathing in his description of the 19th-century British intellectual [[Thomas Carlyle]]. The latter work is a general history of the Caribbean from the 15th through the mid-20th centuries. Curiously, it appeared at the same time as a similarly titled book (''De Cristóbal Colón a Fidel Castro'') by another Caribbean scholar-statesman, [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] of the [[Dominican Republic]].

Williams sent one of 73 [[Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages]] to [[NASA]] for the historic first lunar landing in 1969. The message still rests on the lunar surface today. He wrote, in part: "It is our earnest hope for mankind that while we gain the moon, we shall not lose the world."

===The Eric Williams Memorial Collection===
{{Main|Eric Williams Memorial Collection}}
The [[Eric Williams Memorial Collection]] (EWMC) at the [[University of the West Indies]] in Trinidad and Tobago was inaugurated in 1998 by former [[US Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]]. In 1999, it was named to [[UNESCO]]’s prestigious [[Memory of the World Register]]. Secretary Powell heralded Dr. Williams as a tireless warrior in the battle against colonialism, and for his many other achievements as a scholar, politician and international statesman.

The Collection consists of the late Dr. Williams' Library and Archives. Available for consultation by researchers, the Collection amply reflects its owner’s eclectic interests, comprising some 7,000 volumes, as well as correspondence, speeches, manuscripts, historical writings, research notes, conference documents and a miscellany of reports. The Museum contains a wealth of emotive memorabilia of the period and copies of the seven translations of Williams’ major work, ''[[Capitalism and Slavery]]'' (into Russian, Chinese and Japanese [1968, 2004] among them, and a Korean translation was released in 2006). Photographs depicting various aspects of his life and contribution to the development of Trinidad and Tobago complete this extraordinarily rich archive, as does a three-dimensional re-creation of Williams' study.

Dr. [[Colin Palmer]], Dodge Professor of History at [[Princeton University]], has said: “as a model for similar archival collections in the Caribbean...I remain very impressed by its breadth.... [It] is a national treasure.” Palmer's biography of Williams up to 1970, ''Eric Williams and the Making of the Modern Caribbean'' ([[University of North Carolina Press]], 2008), is dedicated to the Collection.

===Film===
In 2011, to mark the centenary of Williams' birth, Mariel Brown directed the documentary film ''Inward Hunger: the Story of Eric Williams'', scripted by Alake Pilgrim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.tt/columnist/2011/10/05/inward-hunger-movie Raymond Ramcharitar, "Inward Hunger: The Movie"], ''Guardian Media'', 5 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabrielle''' is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Renee O'Connor]] in the American fantasy TV series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (1995-2001). She is referred to by fans as the Battling Bard of Potidaea. Her trademark weapons are the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Quarterstaff|fighting staff]] and later, the [[sai (weapon)|sais]]. She was also an [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Princess]] and later an [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Queen regnant|Queen]]. The character's development and progression is a story that spans the entire show's run, with her first appearance in "Sins of the Past" seeing her as a naive farm girl, and the final episode, "A Friend In Need (Part 2)" seeing her as a fully formed but rational warrior, set to follow in the deceased Xena's footsteps.

The dwarf planet [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] and its moon [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]] had the interim names "Xena" and "Gabrielle" until they were officially named.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

''Gabrielle'' is the [[French language|French]] feminine form of the [[given name]] [[Gabriel]], the [[Archangel]], from the [[Hebrew]] meaning "messenger of God". The Greek transliteration of "Gabrielle" would be Γαβριέλα, (Gavriela).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whoosh.org/issue79/reams3.html|title=A Woman of Deception: Gabrielle???!|publisher=Whoosh.org|accessdate=2007-05-16}}{{Verify credibility|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==

===From farm girl to warrior===

When Gabrielle first meets [[Xena]], she is a farm girl living in the village of [[Potidaea]]. She and her sister, [[Lila (Xena)|Lila]], along with several other village girls, have been kidnapped by the men of the warlord, [[Draco (Xena)|Draco]], to be sold as [[slavery|slaves]]. Xena intervenes and rescues them. Awed by her fighting skills, Gabrielle decides that she wants to become a warrior too. She also wants to avoid the marriage that her parents, Herodotus and Hecuba, have arranged for her with her childhood friend [[Perdicas]].

Gabrielle starts the series as a young adult who more or less stands behind Xena, and relies on Xena to protect her.&lt;ref name="Sins"/&gt; Later on in the series, she acquires a [[quarterstaff]] from the Greek [[Amazons]]&lt;ref name="hooves"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hooves and Harlots|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1995-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starts to use it as both a defensive and offensive weapon, displaying some skill in using the staff.&lt;ref name="beware Greeks"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Beware Greeks Bearing Gifts|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1996-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series goes on, Gabrielle's skills with the staff continue to develop. In one episode, Gabrielle takes on numerous soldiers and single-handedly attempts to rescue Xena's presumed dead body.&lt;ref name="greater good"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Greater Good|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1996-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two episodes later she is seen blocking an arrow in flight with her staff.&lt;ref name="death mask"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Death Mask|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1996-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Gabrielle also adds kicks and minor [[acrobatics]] to her fighting abilities. Under the tutelage of [[Xena]], she becomes worthy of many foes.

While in [[India]], Gabrielle is thrown through time by a Darsham to save Xena's soul. It is said that [[reincarnation|their souls are together throughout time]].&lt;ref name="between lines"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Between the Lines|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this next life Xena is the Mother of Peace, Arminestra and Gabrielle is Shakti, a Warrior Prince of [[India]].&lt;ref name="between lines"/&gt; At the end of season 4, Gabrielle shows a leap in her warrior abilities. After months of following her path of the Way of Love,&lt;ref name="the way"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Way|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielle picks up the sword of a paralyzed Xena and fights off a large group of Roman soldiers, killing several of them.&lt;ref name="Ides of March"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Ides of March|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By season 5, Gabrielle starts to fight with her [[Sai (weapon)|sai]],&lt;ref name="Chakram"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Chakram|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating more acrobatic abilities, such as performing a wall run and back flip.&lt;ref name="attraction"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Animal Attraction|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sai and sometimes a new casual staff, she can use a large array of weapons with proficiency. Gabrielle also fights against warriors with notable skill; she defeats the warrior Mavican&lt;ref name="succession"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Succession|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and stands against Ares and [[Hades]] (two gods) in battle for a period of time, before they defeat her. She also fights in a sword duel with Brutus, [[Caesar_(Xena:_Warrior_Princess)|Caesar's]] former right hand and one of the leaders of Rome, eventually killing him.&lt;ref name="antony"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Antony and Cleopatra|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielle's abilities throughout the series are noticed by the God of War who seeks her out as his new [[protégée]]. It is mentioned later by Gabrielle that Xena trained her throughout the years, although there have only been a few episodes that actually show Xena giving her any sort of martial arts training.   
One of Gabrielle's biggest fights in the series is her fight against fellow Amazon queen, [[Varia (Xena)|Varia]]. They fight in an enclosed arena in a match in which Eve's life is at stake, and they appeared to be at a stand-off before she is beaten by Varia.&lt;ref name="vengeance"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Path of Vengeance|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2001-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielle takes the loss graciously and continues to grow in skill over the remaining season.

==Characterization==
Gabrielle's bardic skills appear to be natural and self-taught.{{or|date=February 2012}} In the opening episode, she displays a remarkable ability to talk her way out of fearsome or difficult situations: she talks a [[cyclops]] out of eating her, and makes an ally of him; talks an old man into giving her a lift; talks a violent crowd out of killing Xena; and talks her way into joining Xena as her traveling partner.&lt;ref name="Sins"/&gt;

Besides her persuasive ability, she also reads and writes - rare skills for that time, loves to tell stories, and has some musical ability. As she travels with Xena, she records their adventures on a series of scrolls, with an eye for flair and drama. Occasionally her tendency to exaggerate and glamorize the facts gets her into trouble.&lt;ref name="quill"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Quill Is Mightier...|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also shown telling stories for money in an inn. In other episodes she wins a place in the Athens City Academy for Performing Bards,&lt;ref name="athens"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Athens City Academy of the Performing Bards|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a famous playwright, is a theatrical director,&lt;ref name="play"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Play's The Thing|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; plays the [[Pan flute|pan pipes]] with considerable skill,&lt;ref name="prodigal"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Prodigal|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only person able to recite a magical scroll with the correct accents.&lt;ref name="titans"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Titans|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Gabrielle's ascendancy as a warrior (in the episode "The Ides of March" she slew nine Roman legionaries), her role as a bard remains important. About a year into her travels with Xena, her scrolls about Xena's exploits begin to gain popularity, apparently helping, according to Ares, turn Xena into a legend. After their 25-year sleep, Gabrielle finds out that her stories had been read as far away as North Africa where they were popular among nomad tribes.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Legacy|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an episode set in modern times, Gabrielle's scrolls were preserved for thousands of years and discovered during [[World War II]] by modern archeologists who were descendants of Xena, Gabrielle, and [[Joxer]]. The scrolls found their way to Hollywood, where they formed the basis of the television series. This leads into an entire small story-arc in which the modern-day reincarnations of Xena, Gabrielle and Joxer meet and interact. Xena and Gabrielle's reincarnations pair up to make their own names for themselves, instead of living in their father's shadows. Joxer's reincarnation is a fan of the show.&lt;ref name="scrolls"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Xena Scrolls|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1997-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''early plays of [[Henry Fielding]]''' mark the beginning of Fielding's literary career. His early plays span the time period from his first production in 1728 to the beginning of the [[Actor Rebellion of 1733|Actor's Rebellion of 1733]], a strife within the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] that divided the theatrical community and threatened to disrupt London stage performances. These plays introduce Fielding's take on politics, gender, and morality and serve as an early basis for how Fielding develops his ideas on these matters throughout his career.

==Background==
Fielding first produced a play in February 1728. Although his first production, ''[[Love in Several Masques]]'', lasted only a few nights, it was the start of his career in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the [[Leiden University|University of Leyden]], but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. [[Arthur Murphy (writer)|Arthur Murphy]], in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an [[allowance (money)|allowance]] of 200 pounds a year.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is little evidence that Fielding lacked funds, or that such a lack of funds would cause him to leave Leyden to return to writing plays; Fielding eventually returned to Leyden on 22 February 1729. It is not known when or why Fielding left the school, but he produced ''[[The Temple Beau]]'' on 26 January 1730, which suggests that he returned to London by November 1729.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 35–37&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his return, he had three plays, either still in draft form or complete: ''[[Don Quixote in England (play)|Don Quixote in England]]'', ''The Wedding-Day'' and ''The Temple Beau''. Of these, only ''The Temple Beau'' was accepted for the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

When Fielding returned to working with the Royal Theatre, his piece ''[[The Lottery (play)|The Lottery]]'' became an immediate success and lasted for decades after.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with ''[[The Modern Husband]]'', Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding at the position of being the main contributor of plays to the Royal Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 126–129&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as a novelist, but his plays suggest that he wished to be a playwright and that his career would be in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, only a handful of them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early plays==
The early plays include ''Love in Several Masques'', ''The Temple Beau'', ''[[The Author's Farce]]'', ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'', ''[[Rape upon Rape]]'', ''[[The Tragedy of Tragedies]]'', ''[[The Letter Writers]]'', ''[[The Welsh Opera]]'', ''[[The Grub-Street Opera]]'', ''The Lottery'', ''The Modern Husband'', ''[[The Old Debauchees]]'', ''[[The Covent-Garden Tragedy]]'', and ''[[The Mock Doctor]]''. These plays start in 1727, when Fielding first worked on ''Love in Several Masques'', until the disruption of the winter 1732–1733 theatre season at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson 2000 pp. 33–35&lt;/ref&gt; This disruption, caused by illness, management problems, and other incidents, started the [[Actor Rebellion of 1733]].&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 143, 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

===1727–1728===
''[[Love in Several Masques]]'' was Fielding's first play, and was first released on 16 February 1728. Though the play was never revived&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and only ran for four nights,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; it still did moderately well especially when compared with the competing plays at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; In the play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they should prove their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief in the relationship of morality and [[libertine]] beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout his plays and novels.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

''Don Quixote in England'' was started as Fielding's second play, but it was not finished and produced until the later part of his career. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of ''Don Quixote in England''. It was refused by the Theatre Royal and it was not produced or printed until 1734. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's 1734 preface. It was his second play, and Fielding attributes it to being written at Leyden during 1728. It was intended more as amusement than as a serious production and was an imitation of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes's]] ''Don Quixote''. After the prompting of Barton Booth and Colley Cibber, Fielding put away the play until 1733, when the [[Drury Lane|Drury-Lane]] actors asked him for a new play. Soon after, Fielding rewrote parts of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wedding Day'' was started as his third play, but it was not finished until years later and finally brought out on both the stage and in print after his theatrical career ended. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of ''The Wedding-Day''. It was refused by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] to be staged, and it was not produced until 1743 by [[David Garrick]]. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's preface to the play in his ''Miscellanies'' (1743). In it, Fielding says that he intended the leads, Millamour and Charlotte, for [[Robert Wilks]] and [[Anne Oldfield]]. However, Oldfield died before the play could be produced, and Fielding and Wilks got into a fight, which made it impossible for Fielding to convince him to join the production.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

===1729–1730===
Fielding started work on his fourth play, ''The Temple Beau'', in April 1729, but did not finish until the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Rejected by his first theatre,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; the play had to be performed at another one, where it had 13 shows its first year and few revivals thereafter. The play is about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure, and his attempts to marry a woman for her money. Fielding focuses on [[hypocrisy]] and [[gender equality]] in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro 1998 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's fifth play, ''The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town'', first opened on 30 March 1730 at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and initially ran for 41 nights, which marked it as a major success. The play incorporates Fielding's response to Drury Lane and their previous rejection of his works. It also contains a third act, a puppet show, that pokes fun at theatre and the literary community as a whole. The play was revived many times in its original format&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 pp. 192–197&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the medium of puppet show for its entire format.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight 1990 p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The plot focuses on Harry Luckless, an author, as he attempts to have a successful writing career, pursue women, dodge his landlady, and eventually put on a show within the show. To emphasise the literary satire, Fielding introduced his persona "Scriblerus Secundus" and adopts the tradition of the Scriblerus Club.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 31–37&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tom Thumb'', Fielding's sixth play, was added to the ninth showing of ''The Author's Farce'', 24 April 1730. Together, the shows lasted at the Haymarket until they were replaced by Fielding's next production, ''Rape upon Rape''. ''Tom Thumb'' was later included with other productions, including ''Rape upon Rape'', and later transformed into the ''Tragedy of Tragedies''.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In the print edition, Fielding added footnotes, prefaces, and prologues, which introduced the narratorial style found in Fielding's later works.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The plot deals with the English hero, Tom Thumb, who is of only tiny proportions. After defeating a group of giants, Tom Thumb is handsomely rewarded by King Arthur, which later erupts in a comical love triangle between Tom, Arthur's wife Queen Dollalolla, and Princess Huncamunca.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 61–63&lt;/ref&gt; Tom is eventually swallowed by a cow and killed. Soon after, his ghost appears but meets an untimely death. This scene reportedly provoked Jonathan Swift to laughter, a rare feat.&lt;ref&gt;Hillhouse 1918 note p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The farcical nature of Tom Thumb pokes fun at 17th and 18th-century tragedy,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 55–58&lt;/ref&gt; gender roles and gender politics.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1995 pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's seventh play, ''Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap'', was a five-act comedic play that first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The play enjoyed some success until it was renamed ''The Coffee-House Politician'' and was altered to possibly update the play as it focused on mocking current news events.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 pp. 405–417&lt;/ref&gt; The play is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in the play is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 80–89&lt;/ref&gt;

===1731===
[[File:FrontispieceTragedyOfTragedies.png|right|thumb|Frontistpiece to ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'' by Hogarth]]

Fielding's expanded version of ''Tom Thumb'', ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'', first ran on 24 March 1731. Its printed edition was "edited" and "commented" on by Fielding's pseudonym H. Scriblerus Secundus who pretends not to be the original author,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 70–73&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains a frontispiece by Hogarth, which serves as the earliest proof of a relationship between Fielding and Hogarth.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden 1966 p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; There are few major changes to the plot's outline except that Grizzle became Tom's rival for Huncamunca's heart, and Tom is not killed by Grizzle. Instead, Tom is able to defeat Grizzle, which changes the outcome of the play. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on faulty language and Fielding emphasises the problems within poorly written tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's ninth play, the unsuccessful ''The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home'', ran for four nights as a companion piece to ''The Tragedy of Tragedies''&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon after replaced by ''The Welsh Opera'' on 22 April 1731.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The play followed two characters whose wives are busy having affairs and how they attempt to keep their wives faithful. The immoral characters are forgiven within the play and there is a lack of moral commentary within the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth play and new companion piece to ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'', ''The Welsh Opera'', ran many times until it was expanded into ''The Grub-Street Opera''. The expanded version of the play, ''The Grub-Street Opera'', was not put on for an audience, which provoked E. Rayner to print ''The Welsh Opera'' without Fielding's consent.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The play serves both as a tribute to the Scriblerians, especially Gay and Gay's ''The Beggar's Opera'', and to put forth a political allegory that satirises [[Robert Walpole|Walpole's]] government and the British monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it mocked the feud between Walpole and [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Pulteney]], a Privy Councillor.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding 2004 II pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The expanded and altered version of ''The Welsh Opera'', ''The Grub-Street Opera'', was first rehearsed in May 1731,&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; but it never ran on stage. It was printed and exists in a complete printed format,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that it was not performed because of government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Goldgar 1976 p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Its original printing was done without Fielding's consent,&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; and it is uncertain as to when Fielding's official version of the play was printed.&lt;ref&gt;Morrissey 1973 pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; The plot focuses on a standard love story but with characters that exhibit less than virtuous characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The title pokes fun at the ''Grub Street Journal'' and also links to the theme within the plot of attacking theatre in general.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 95–97&lt;/ref&gt;

===1732===
After Fielding returned to working with the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, he wrote ''The Lottery'', which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's ''Cato''. The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes fun at the London lottery system and those who support it.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's thirteenth play, ''The Modern Husband'', first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 nights at Drury Lane, rivalling the run of the ''Provok'd Husband'' and ''Zara'' for production length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 122–126&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Old Debauchees'', originally titled ''The Despairing Debauchee'', appeared with ''The Covent-Garden Tragedy'' on 1 June 1732. The play ran for six nights and was later paired with ''The Mock Doctor''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 129–133&lt;/ref&gt; The play was later revived to attack Catholics during the disputes with the Stuarts between 1745 and 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary 1984 pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; The play alludes to the 1731 trial of Father Girard, a Jesuit tried for using magic during an attempted seduction/rape of a young girl. The nature of the attacks against Catholicism within the play undermines the overall humour of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 130–132&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''The Covent-Garden Tragedy'' appeared with ''The Old Debauchees'', it was not a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first night because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 129–132&lt;/ref&gt; After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson 2000 pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the first night fell apart, the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with ''Don Quixote in England'', once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding's sixteenth play, ''The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd'', replaced ''The Covent Garden Tragedy'' as the companion play to ''The Old Debauchees''. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's ''Le Medecin malgre Lui''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; It first ran on 23 June 1732&lt;ref&gt;Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 136–138&lt;/ref&gt; and was later revised in 1732; both versions were very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute to avoid having to marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro 1998 pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and concern==
In 1728, John Gay's ''The Beggar's Opera'' was extremely successful and ran for 62 times during the season, an unprecedented length of time.&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1988 p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The play began to change London theatre through the introduction of political themes and experimentation in form. Following this trend, Fielding pushed politics into the forefront of his plays. This provoked criticism from all sides, including from the playwright Colley Cibber.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Beggar's Opera'' is not Fielding's only influence; Fielding is part of the theatrical tradition surrounding him, and, as Harold Pagliaro points out, "Fielding's first play, like all those to follow, is among other things an accommodation to the world of theatre in which he worked."&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro 1998 p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding was concerned with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in the actions of the character Merital in ''Love in Several Masques'' in controlling the behaviour of Helen and that many of his characters believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading and how reading defines characters is a focus within many plays and in Fielding's later works. In ''Love in Several Masques'', the character Wisemore focuses on classics but ignores contemporary society. Similarly, the character Wilding, in ''The Temple Beau'', practices law but doesn't read at all. Reading is an outlet to understanding humanity, and Fielding uses his plays to inform an audience how to better understand humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Morality and moral characters was an important concern within Fielding's works, and his first play serves as a representation for Fielding's believes surrounding the relationship between morality and libertine beliefs that is found throughout his work. The plays also introduces most of the character types that Fielding would reuse throughout his plays and novels. However, his use of libertine themes and characters served as a way for those like Pat Rogers to believe that Fielding lacked an orthodox understanding of Christianity; he believes that Fielding was harsh towards hypocrisy but not against other actions.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Rogers claims, "Fielding was generous enough in that sphere of morality, however implacable he might be in his larger political and religious attachment. Provided that soldiers were brave and loyal he did not require their lives to be models of absolute purity."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1979 p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Tiffany Potter follows this idea by claiming, "Eliminating a moral imperative to drama (and to life in general) gives Fielding the liberty to create unconventional characters and to set plays anywhere from ballrooms to brothels without having to defend anything more than his own stance on issues. The necessity of even that defence, however, is usually negated by his libertine belief in privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
Gender plays a large role within Fielding's moral critique, and effeminacy is a means to emphasise a male character's moral shortcomings or problematic deviations from social and cultural traditions. Starting with ''Love in Several Masques'', the stock characters that he relies on emphasise the deviations by recalling traditional behavioural stereotypes and in their commentary on the masculinity or femininity of other characters. The political implications for gender extend to a criticism of powerful female within the domestic and public domains. Many of the problems portrayed within the plays are the results of the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] extended into politics, especially within ''Tom Thumb''. As Jill Campbell points out, not only does Fielding critique women in power, but the reversals of gender and power serve as a way to say that private concerns are taking priority over public concerns. In his plays and his novels, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans, which includes both emotions and morality. Although Fielding sometimes uses females to express ideal ways to act, he does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality to dominate and assume power. This theme appears as early as ''Love in Several Masques'' and continues throughout, especially in prose parody ''Shamela'' where Shamela falsifies claims to virtue to control and get ahead in life.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1995 pp. 20–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding does not limit his analysis of gender roles to just the living; the image of the ghost plays a significant part in many of Fielding's plays, including ''The Author's Farce'', the ''Tom Thumb'' plays, and ''The Covent Garden Tragedy''. Even though Fielding fails to explain what the existence of ghosts means, the image of the ghost can serve as a metaphor for Fielding's expectation of women who are supposed to be publicly virtuous. According to Campbell,
&lt;blockquote&gt;woman bears the representational burden for Fielding of his disappointment about the relation between internal and external selves, as, culturally, she must sustain the realm of private life, interior feeling, and personal identity apart from the public and commercial world of the male; inevitably, then, she must fail Fielding through her reliance on the 'harlotry' of pomp, ostentation, or the drama of self-display if she is to be a part of this world. And yet, he fears her alternative fate as a ghost as well, though he may seem to wish it on her.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1995 p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not every critic sees that Fielding sets up an inevitable fall for women. Potter argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them. In the earliest examples of the redefinition that develops throughout Fielding's works, virtue is no longer simply virginity, but something malleable and powerful in the hands of a woman granted the agency and intelligence to determine her own sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Counter to Campbell, Potter seems to emphasise how gender is removed and emphasises that Fielding sees gender as a social construct. There is a balancing of the genders and neither is favoured over the other. To Potter, "Only the weakening of humanity through cross-adoption of the most ridiculous qualities of either gender is attacked in Fielding's plays."&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The reception of Fielding's plays received early recognition; his early plays placed him in a position of popularity alongside Gay.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
George Bernard Shaw believed that Fielding was "the greatest practising dramatist, with the single exception of Shakespeare, produced in England between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw 1963 p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern critics rarely agree with Shaw, as Robert Hume points out, "Few scholars have been much interested in Fielding's highly successful career as a dramatist. To most it has seemed a false start. Readers tend to find the conventional plays derivative and sentimental, the topical ones scrappy and superficial."&lt;ref&gt;Hume 1985 p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, only one book until 1988 was published on the topic, which was Ducrocq's ''Le theatre de Fielding, 1728–1737, et ses prolongements dans l'oeuvre romanesque''. This critical approach is not limited to just Fielding, but to the whole field;&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. ix–xi&lt;/ref&gt; the reputation of Colley Cibber was ruined by Pope's characterising him as the Arch Dunce and "Since the plays of Cibber's only serious rival, Henry Fielding, are hardly even read these days, let alone performed, the earlier eighteenth-century theater tends to be passed over with (at best) a polite cough."&lt;ref&gt;Varey 1985 p. 6, qtd by Rivero p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Paul Hunter believes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fielding's plays do not prophesy that he will become a major novelist, but the direction of his theatrical career does suggest concerns that increasingly led him away from pure representation [...] Fielding's separation from the theatre was a forced one, but the expulsion was fortunate, freeing him from a relationship and commitment that had always been in some sense against the grain [...] Fielding's way is not really very dramatic, either in novels or in plays; he never developed stage-likely objective correlatives, having reserved his artistic energy for the examining process in which the action is rerun again and again, reviewed, considered, nearly masticated.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter 1975 p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Albert Rivero, ten of the plays "mark significant moments in [Fielding's] theatrical life": ''Love in Several Masques'', ''The Temple Beau'', ''The Author's Farce'', ''Tom Thumb'', ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'', ''Rape upon Rape'', ''The Grub Street Opera'', ''The Modern Husband'', ''Pasquin'', and ''The Historical Register''.&lt;ref&gt;Rivero 1989 pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Potter organised the plays by a general theme of developing libertine characters and believed that "Fielding's most successful group of plays followed ''Love in Several Masques'' both chronologically and thematically. Comedies and burlesques such as ''The Author's Farce'', ''The Tragedy of Tragedies'', ''The Old Debauchees'', and ''Pasquin'' made Fielding the most popular playwright of the 1730s, and all of these plays contain characters, situations, and dialogues that invoke libertine philosophy in some way, thought they vary in the explicitness of the depiction."&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1999 p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; In his biography of Fielding, Pagliaro declares that "Between 1727 and 1737, by which time he was only 30 years old, Fielding became England's most successful living playwright."&lt;ref&gt;Pagliaro 1998 p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
{{Main article|Sarapion|Maritime history of Somalia}}
It's believed [[Somalis]] homeland is northern Somalia and they have always inhabited that territory until the Somali pastoral clans migrated to southern Somalia in the 1st century AD to populate the [[Horn of Africa]]. The Somalis then established farmlands in [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] valleys and wealthy ports in southern Somali coastline and by then Mogadishu was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X1dDDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Somali+ancestral+home&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6ef0Cptjf9&amp;sig=AoBZCY7ZtstMD7--vrRQvLvR_wY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGl82i_PjYAhWCC8AKHRT5DTsQ6AEIWDAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the antiquity times. Mogadishu was part of the [[Somali maritime history|Somali city-states]] that in engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting [[Somali people|Somali]] merchants with [[Phoenicia]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemic Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Parthia|Parthian Persia]], [[Sabaeans|Saba]], [[Nabataea]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the ''[[beden]]'' to transport their cargo.

According to the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', maritime trade connected [[Somali people|Somalis]] in the Mogadishu area (known to the Romans and Greeks as [[Sarapion]]) with other communities along the [[Indian Ocean]] coast as early as the 1st century CE. The ancient trading power of Sarapion has been postulated to be the predecessor of Mogadishu. Probably Sarapion was located south of actual Mogadishu, in an area where have been found [[Roman coins]].

===Ajuran Empire===
{{main article|Ajuran Sultanate}}
[[File:Ancient-Almnara.jpg|thumb|left|''Almnara Tower'', Mogadishu.]]
In the early 13th century, Mogadishu along with other coastal and interior Somali cities in southern Somalia and eastern Ethiopia came under the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] control and experienced another Golden Age. 

During his travels, [[Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi]] (1213–1286) noted that Mogadishu city had already become the leading Islamic center in the region.

By this time Mogadishu ruled Sultan  Abubakar &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|page=252|author= Michael Dumper, Bruce E. Stanley|location=US|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;Ibnu Faqrudin, 1269 built oldest mosque in Mogadishu till now can be viewed in Hamar weyne District.  Sultan Omer ibnu Abubakar Faqrudin ruled Mogadishu (@Aroone)  By the time of the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] traveller [[Ibn Battuta]]'s appearance on the Somali coast in 1331, the city was at the zenith of its prosperity. He described Mogadishu as "an exceedingly large city" with many rich merchants, which was famous for its high quality [[Textile|fabric]] that it exported to [[Egypt]], among other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Somalia: A Country Study|author= Helen Chapin Metz|location=US|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |year=1992| ISBN = 0844407755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Shinnie, ''The African Iron Age'', (Clarendon Press: 1971), p.135&lt;/ref&gt; Battuta added that the city was ruled by a Somali [[Sultan]], Abu Bakr ibn Sayx 'Umar,&lt;ref name="Versteegh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Versteegh|first=Kees|title=Encyclopedia of Arabic language and linguistics, Volume 4|year=2008|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004144765|page=276|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWQOAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laisas"&gt;David D. Laitin, Said S. Samatar, ''Somalia: Nation in Search of a State'', (Westview Press: 1987), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; who was originally from [[Berbera]] in northern Somalia and spoke both [[Somali language|Somali]] (referred to by Battuta as ''Benadir'', a southern [[Somali language|Somali]] dielect) and Arabic with equal fluency.&lt;ref name="Laisas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapurukha Makokha Kusimba, ''The Rise and Fall of Swahili States'', (AltaMira Press: 1999), p.58&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan also had a retinue of [[Vizier|wazir]]s (ministers), legal experts, commanders, royal [[eunuch]]s, and other officials at his beck and call.&lt;ref name="Laisas" /&gt;

[[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332 to 1406) noted in his book that Mogadishu was a massive [[metropolis]] city that served as the capital of the Ajuran Kingdom. He also claimed that the city of Mogadishu was a very populous city with many wealthy [[merchants]], yet nomad in character. He referred to the characteristics of the inhabitants of Mogadishu as tall swarthy Berbers and called them the people of Al-Somaal.&lt;ref name="Ibn Khaldun"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6r9mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ibn+khaldun+book&amp;dq=ibn+khaldun+book&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAibCAifvZAhVeF8AKHWjJCREQ6AEINTAC|title=Ibn Khaldun and the Medieval Maghrib|first=Michael|last=Brett|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|accessdate=6 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruler of the [[Somali people|Somali]] Ajuran Empire sent ambassadors to [[China]] to establish diplomatic ties, creating the first ever recorded African community in China and the most notable [[Somali people|Somali]] ambassador in medieval China was [[Sa'id of Mogadishu]] who was the first African man to set foot in [[China]]. In return, Emperor Yongle, the third emperor of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368-1644), dispatched one of the largest fleets in history to trade with the Somali nation. The fleet, under the leadership of the famed Hui Muslim [[Zheng He]], arrived at[Mogadishu the capital of Ajuran Empire while the city was at its zenith. Along with [[gold]], [[frankincense]] and [[fabric]]s, Zheng brought back the first ever African wildlife to China, which included [[hippo]]s, [[giraffe]]s and [[gazelle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Samuel M.

The [[Portuguese Empire]] was unsuccessful of conquering  Mogadishu where the powerful naval Portuguese commander called [[Portuguese Navy|João de Sepúvelda]] and his army fleets was soundly defeated by the powerful Ajuran navy during the [[Battle of Benadir]].&lt;ref&gt;The Portuguese period in East Africa – Page 112&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the 16th-century explorer, [[Leo Africanus]] indicates that the native inhabitants of the Mogadishu the capital of Ajuran Sultanate polity were of the same origins as the denizens of the northern people of [[Zeila]] the capital of [[Adal Sultanate]]. They were generally tall with an olive skin complexion, with some being darker and spoke [[Somali language|Somali]]. They would wear traditional rich white silk wrapped around their bodies and have Islamic turbans and coastal people would only wear sarongs, and use Arabic writing script as their lingua franca. Their weaponry consisted of traditional Somali weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, [[battle axe]], and [[bow and arrow|bows]], although they received assistance from its close ally the [[Ottoman Empire]] and with the import of firearms such as [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s. Most were Muslims, although a few adhered to heathen bedouin tradition; there were also a number of Abyssinian Christians further inland. Mogadishu itself was a wealthy, powerful and well-built city-state, which maintained commercial trade with kingdoms across the world. The [[metropolis]] city was surrounded by walled stone fortifications.&lt;ref name="Leo Africanus source"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fTd6QAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Leo+Africanus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9pruhvqDaAhVIIMAKHZIlBPEQ6AEILTAB|title=A Geographical Historie of Africa|first=Leo|last=(Africanus)|date=6 April 1969|publisher=Theatrum Orbis Terrarum|accessdate=6 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After enterin Mogadishu, the Darandoolle quarrelled with the Ajuran, over watering rights. The Ajuran had decreed: ‘At the wells in our territory, the people known as Darandoolle and the other Hiraab cannot water their herds by day, but only at night’’…Then all the Darandoolle gathered in one place. The leaders decided to make war on the Ajuran. They found the King of the Ajuran in a huge palace in Mogadishu where he was seated on the rock. They killed him with a sword. As they struck him with the sword, they split his body together with the rock on which he was seated. He died immediately and the Ajuran migrated out of the country.’

The Darandoolle became as such the first group to rebel against the tyranny of Ajuran in the interior, and ever since this Ajuran defeat other groups would follow in the rebellion which would eventually bring down Ajuran rule of the inter-riverine region. 

After the defeat of the Ajuran in the interior, the Darandoolle Mudulood established themselves around Mogadishu and Shabelle river valley, in which Wacdaan inhabited the environs of Afgoye, Hilibi in Lower Shabelle, [[Moobleen]] went part of the region now known as [[Shabelle|Middle Shabelle]], while the Mataan established themselves in and around Mogadishu city, where 1720 Mataan collected tax and port tariffs of the city, and emerged as the authority of Mogadishu city.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico, Cerulli, How a Hawiye tribe used to live, Chapter 4, scritti vari editi ed inediti, Vol. 2, edited by Enrico Cerulli, Roma&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee V.

==Early Modern Period==

===Geledi Sultanate===
{{main article|Geledi Sultanate}}
In the late 1800s, the Omani Sultan of Zanzibar also briefly claimed to control Mogadishu in the [[Horn of Africa|Horn]] and southern Somalia. However, power on the ground remained in the hands of the powerful Somali kingdom called [[Geledi Sultanate]] (which, also holding sway over the [[Jubba River]] and [[Shebelle Valley|Shebelle]] region in [[Somalia]]'s interior, was at its zenith).&lt;ref name="Lewis88"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.

The Italians eventually purchased the executive rights in 1905, and made Mogadishu the capital of the newly established [[Italian Somaliland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Janice|title=Somalia in Pictures|p=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMRf1RZ9zkAC&amp;pg=PA28|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-6586-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian Somalia===
In 1892, [[Osman Ahmed]] leased the city to [[Italy]]. Italy purchased the city in 1905 and made Mogadishu the capital of the newly established [[Italian Somaliland]]&lt;ref&gt;https://dadfeatured.blogspot.com/2018/05/italian-mogadishu.html Italian Mogadiscio]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the early 1930s, the new Italian governors, [[Guido Corni]] and Maurizio Rava, started a policy of non-coercive assimilation of locals. Many Mogadishu residents were subsequently enlisted into the Italian colonial troops, and thousands of Italian settlers moved to live in the city. Mogadishu also re-assumed its historic position as an important commercial centre, with some small manufacturing companies established within the city limits and in some agricultural areas around the capital, such as Genale and [[Jowhar]] (''Villaggio duca degli Abruzzi'').&lt;ref&gt;Bevilacqua, Piero. ''Storia dell'emigrazione italiana''. p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Mogadishu underwent a period of infrastructural expansion in the late 1930s, with new buildings and avenues such as the "Arch of Triumph" erected in 1934. In 1936, the city had a population of 50,000 inhabitants of which 20,000 were [[Italian Somalis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fedoa.unina.it/1881/1/Santoianni_Progettazione_Architettonica.pdf Italian arquitecture in Somalia (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian settlers also connected the city to [[Jowhar]] via 114&amp;nbsp;km railway and a newly asphalted Imperial Road leading toward to [[Addis Ababa]] and in the late 1930s created the international airport with a huge enlargement of the [[port of Mogadishu]].

In 1941, British forces invaded and occupied Mogadishu and Italian Somaliland at large as part of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]].

==Somali Youth League==
{{main article|Somali Youth League}}
[[File:Flag of the Somali Youth League.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL), the nation's first political party.]]
The [[Somali Youth League]] formed in 1943 succeeded in uniting all Somali clans under its flag and led the country on the road to independence by drawing inspiration from the early 20th century Somali nationalist; [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and his [[Dervish state|Dervish Dream]], as well as invoking the history of the [[History of Somalia|medieval Somali empires and Kingdoms]]. SYL called for national unity and rejected clan divisions. Faced with growing Italian political pressure inimical to continued British tenure and to Somali aspirations for independence, the Somalis and the British came to see each other as allies. The situation prompted British officials to encourage the Somalis to form political parties. In 1945, the [[Potsdam conference]] was held, where it was decided not to return Italian Somaliland to Italy.&lt;ref name="Federal"&gt;Federal Research Division, ''Somalia: A Country Study'', (Kessinger Publishing, LLC: 2004), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali nationalist agitation against the possibility of Italian rule reached the level of violent confrontation in 1948, when on 11 January, large riots broke out that left fifty-two Italians (and 14 Somalis pro-Italy) dead in the streets of Mogadishu and other coastal cities in which many more were injured. In Mogadishu a two-hour battle "with bullets, arrows, broken bottles and knives" ensued during an SYL parade. During those clashes [[Hawo Tako]] participated, following the visit of the [[Allied Control Council|Four-Power Commission]], where she eventually was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  She later became a symbol for [[Greater Somalia|Pan-Somalism]], and the nationalist [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL), who proclaimed her a [[martyr]]. When in 1949 news reached Mogadishu that the UN General Assembly was discussing the possibility of the return of Italian administration, more violent riots broke out in the city. In November 1949, the [[United Nations]] opted to grant Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland, but only under close supervision and on the condition — first proposed by the SYL and other nascent Somali political organizations that were then agitating for independence — that Somalia should achieve independence within ten years.&lt;ref name="Zolberg"&gt;Aristide R.

==Trust Territory of Somalia (1950-1960)==
{{main article|Trust Territory of Somalia}}
Following the dissolution of the former Italian Somaliland, the new [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] was established as a transitional step toward eventual independence. Italy would administer the polity from 1950 to 1960 under a UN mandate.&lt;ref name="Ctaptrtios"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/somalia/14.htm Trusteeship and Protectorate: The Road to Independence of Somalia]&lt;/ref&gt;

This period was marked by significant urban and economic development.&lt;ref name="Ctaptrtios"/&gt; New post-secondary institutions of law, economics and social studies were also founded. These academies were affiliated with the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] and included the [[Somali National University]].

On 13 April 1956, administration of the territory was transferred in full to the Somali politicians, and a seventy-member legislative assembly was formed with the participation of SYL members (who agreed with the Italians). The first general elections in Somalia under universal suffrage were won by the SYL, whose then leader, [[Abdullahi Issa]], became [[prime minister]], and [[Aden Abdulle Osman Daar]] became [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] of [[parliament]]. The new government would go on to implement various economic and social reforms.

British Somaliland became independent on June 26, 1960 as the [[State of Somaliland]], and the [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] (the former Italian Somaliland) followed suit five days later.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', (Encyclopædia Britannica: 2002), p. 835&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 1960, the two territories united to form the [[Somali Republic]], with Mogadishu as the nation's capital.&lt;ref name="Wssom1"&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Somalia.html Somalia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 2002 p. 835"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', (Encyclopædia Britannica: 2002), p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence==
{{main article|Somali Republic|Somali Democratic Republic}}
[[File:Mogadishu city centre - 1960s.jpg|thumb|An avenue in Mogadishu, 1963]]
A government was formed by Abdullahi Issa and other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with [[Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf]] as President of the Somali National Assembly, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as [[List of Presidents of Somalia|President]] of the Somali Republic and [[Abdirashid Ali Shermarke]] as [[Prime Minister of Somalia|Prime Minister]] (later to become President from 1967–1969). On 20 July 1961 and through a [[Somali constitutional referendum, 1961|popular referendum]], the people of Somalia ratified a new [[Constitution of Somalia|constitution]], which was first drafted in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Greystone Press Staff, ''The Illustrated Library of The World and Its Peoples: Africa, North and East'', (Greystone Press: 1967), p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal]] became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke.

In the [[Somali parliamentary election, 1964|first national elections]] after independence, held in Mogadishu on 30 March 1964, the SYL won an absolute majority of 69 of the 123 parliamentary seats. The remaining seats were divided among 11 parties. Five years from then, in general elections held in March 1969, the ruling SYL returned to power. However, on 15 October 1969, while paying a visit to the northern town of [[Las Anod]], Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military [[coup d'état]] on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the [[Military of Somalia|Somali Army]] seized power without encountering armed opposition — essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General [[Siad Barre|Mohamed Siad Barre]], who at the time commanded the army.&lt;ref name="Myswenvwp"&gt;Moshe Y. Sachs, ''Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Nations'', Volume 2, (Worldmark Press: 1988), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Barre, the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]] (SRC) that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination was led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Salaad Gabeyre Kediye]] and Chief of Police [[Jama Korshel]]. Kediye officially held the title of "Father of the Revolution," and Barre shortly afterwards became the head of the SRC.&lt;ref name="Adam"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adam|first=Hussein Mohamed|author2=Richard Ford|title=Mending rips in the sky: options for Somali communities in the 21st century|publisher=Red Sea Press|year=1997|pages=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0m9yAAAAMAAJ|isbn=1-56902-073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SRC subsequently renamed the country the [[Somali Democratic Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;J.

The revolutionary army established various large-scale public works programs, including the [[Mogadishu Stadium]]. In addition to a [[nationalization]] program of industry and land, the Mogadishu-based new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the [[Arab world]], eventually joining the [[Arab League]] (AL) in 1974.&lt;ref name="Frankel"&gt;Benjamin Frankel, ''The Cold War, 1945–1991: Leaders and other important figures in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and the Third World'', (Gale Research: 1992), p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Somali Civil War==
{{main article|Somali Civil War}}

===Collapse of government and UN intervention===
{{main article|Unified Task Force}}
By the late 1980s, the [[moral authority]] of Barre's regime had collapsed. The authorities became increasingly totalitarian, and [[resistance movement]]s, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] administration, sprang up across the country. This eventually led in 1991 to the outbreak of the civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the [[Military of Somalia|Somali National Army]] (SNA). Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by USC commanders General [[Mohamed Farah Aidid]] and [[Ali Mahdi Mohamed]], in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.&lt;ref name="Lirs"&gt;Library Information and Research Service, ''The Middle East: Abstracts and index'', Volume 2, (Library Information and Research Service: 1999), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aerial view of a US helicopter as it flies over a Mogadishu residential area.JPEG|thumb|right|A residential area of Mogadishu, with a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter in the foreground (1992).]]
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 733|UN Security Council Resolution 733]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 746|UN Security Council Resolution 746]] led to the creation of [[United Nations Operation in Somalia I|UNOSOM I]], the first stabilization mission in Somalia after the dissolution of the central government. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 794]] was unanimously passed on December 3, 1992, which approved a coalition of [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeepers]] led by the [[United States]]. Forming the [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF), the alliance was tasked with assuring security until humanitarian efforts were transferred to the UN. Landing in 1993, the UN peacekeeping coalition started the two-year [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II]] (UNOSOM II) primarily in the south.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Rutherford (scientist)|Ken Rutherford]], [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565492609 ''Humanitarianism Under Fire: The US and UN Intervention in Somalia,'' Kumarian Press, July 2008] {{ISBN|1-56549-260-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the militias that were then competing for power interpreted the UN troops' presence as a threat to their hegemony. Consequently, several gun battles took place in Mogadishu between local gunmen and peacekeepers. Among these was the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] of 1993, an unsuccessful attempt by US troops to apprehend faction leader Aidid.

With these casualties, [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] withdrew American forces in 1994. Two factions in Mogadishu reached a peace accord the same year, on January 16. However, fighting continued for control over the city, prompting the eventual withdrawal of the last international peacekeepers by March 3, 1995.

General Aidid later declared himself president in June 1995. By 1996, his forces had captured strategic neighborhoods in Mogadishu and some outlying territory. Following renewed fighting in the city and Hoddur, Aidid ultimately died in July 1996 from gunshot wounds suffered in a street battle.

===Second Battle of Mogadishu===
{{main article|Second Battle of Mogadishu}}
On 7 May 2006, fighting broke out between [[Islamism|Islamist]] militias and an alliance of Somali faction leaders over control of Mogadishu. The opposing forces were the [[Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism]] (ARPCT), and militia loyal to the [[Islamic Court Union]] (ICU). The conflict began in mid-February 2006, when various warlords formed the ARPCT to challenge the emerging influence of the ICU. It was alleged that the [[Foreign relations of the United States|United States]] had been provided funding for the ARPCT due to concerns that the ICU had ties to [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US cash support for Somali warlords 'destabilising nation'|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]], [[Reuters]], [[The Independent]]|date=June 7, 2006|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10385312|accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the combat was concentrated in the Sii-Sii (often written "CC" in English) &lt;!--the letter "C" in Somali is pronounced totally differently than in English, so the abbreviation wouldn't be used there--&gt; district in northern Mogadishu with both the Islamist militias and the secular factions leaders fighting for control of Mogadishu. On 5 June 2006, the ICU militia seized the city.

===Fall of Mogadishu===
{{main article|Fall of Mogadishu}}
[[File:Somali05.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Mogadishu in 2006.]]
While the ICU consolidated control over Mogadishu, a UN-supported [[Transitional Federal Parliament|Transitional Government]] remained undefeated in Baidoa, despite a series of military setbacks. An attempt by the ICU to capture Baidoa prompted a military [[War in Somalia (2006–present)|intervention by Ethiopia]] in support of the Transitional Government starting December 21, 2006. On December 25 Ethiopian jets bombed Mogadishu's main airport held by the ICU since June. Witnesses reported [[MiG]] fighter jets fired missiles into the airport twice. One person was killed and a number injured.

===Battle of Mogadishu (2007)===
{{main article|Battle of Mogadishu (March – April 2007)}}
In January 2007, an Islamic insurgency erupted in Mogadishu, targeting government and Ethiopian forces. A helicopter was shot down as battles engulf in the city on March 30, 2007. Two [[Ethiopia]]n helicopters fired on a rebel stronghold before one was hit by a missile. In addition, Ethiopia told its forces had killed 200 insurgents in a two-day joint offensive with Somali troops against the [[Islamic Courts Union]].&lt;ref name="HELICOPTER-SHOT-DOWN-AS-BATTLES-ENGULF-MOGADISHU"&gt;[http://investing.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2007-03-30T175416Z_01_L30116300_RTRUKOC_0_UK-SOMALIA-CONFLICT.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=HP-C3-World-4 Helicopter shot down as battles engulf Mogadishu] Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Shabaab insurgency===
{{main article|Al-Shabaab (militant group)}}
Following its defeat in the [[Battle of Ras Kamboni]], the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272bc,0.html|title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 – The Commission's Watch List: Somalia|publisher=Unhcr.org|date=2009-05-01|accessdate=2010-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005900/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CUSCIRF%2C%2C%2C4a4f272bc%2C0.html|archivedate=2011-05-10|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between May 31 and June 9, 2008, representatives of Somalia's federal government and the moderate [[Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia]] (ARS) group of Islamist rebels participated in peace talks in [[Djibouti]] brokered by the UN. The conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation. Parliament was subsequently expanded to 550 seats to accommodate ARS members, which then elected a new president.&lt;ref name=2009factbook&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html|title=Somalia|accessdate=2009-05-31|date=2009-05-14|work=[[World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of a small team of African Union troops, the coalition government also began a [[War in Somalia (2009-)|counteroffensive]] in February 2009 to retake control of the southern half of the country. To solidify its control of southern Somalia, the TFG formed an alliance with the Islamic Courts Union, other members of the [[Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia]], and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]], a moderate [[Sufism|Sufi]] militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=kamaal says:|url=http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/|title=UN boss urges support for Somalia ahead of Istanbul summit|publisher=Horseedmedia.net|date=2010-05-22|accessdate=2010-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619183438/http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/|archivedate=2010-06-19|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hu-funeral sermon and prayer OSZK.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The "''Funeral Sermon and Prayer''". This text, dated to 1192, is the oldest longer Hungarian-only document. Earlier, Hungarian sentences and words appeared in Latin context.]]

'''[[Magyar language|Hungarian]]''' is a [[Uralic language]] of the [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] group. It has been spoken in the region of modern-day [[Hungary]] since the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] in the late 9th century.

The predecessor language of Hungarian separated from the [[Ob-Ugric]] languages, probably still during the [[Bronze Age]]. There is no attestation for a period of close to two millennia. '''Old Hungarian''' is attested fragmentarily in epigraphy in the [[Old Hungarian script]] beginning in the 10th century, and isolated Hungarian words are attested in manuscript tradition from the turn of the 11th century. The oldest surviving coherent text in Old Hungarian is the ''[[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]]'', dated to 1192.

The Old Hungarian period is by convention taken to cover [[Medieval Hungary]], from the invasion of Pannonia in AD 896, to the collapse of the Kingdom of Hungary following the [[Battle of Mohács]] of 1526. A '''Middle Hungarian''' phase is by convention taken to last from 1526 to 1772, i.e. from the first books printed in Hungarian to the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which prompted [[language reform]]s that resulted in the modern literary Hungarian language.

The happenings of the 1530s and 1540s brought a new situation to the country: the time of Humanism – which only a few decades earlier, under Matthias of Hungary flourished – was over; the population, both in villages and towns, was terrorized by Ottoman raids; the majority of the country was lost; and the remainder began to feel the problems of the new Habsburg rule. This predicament caused backwardness in the cultural life as well.

However, Hungary, with the previously listed great territorial and human losses, soon entered into a new cultural era, the Protestant Reformation. This religious movement heartened many authors to find new ways. Cultural life was primarily based in Transylvania, but Royal Hungary also saw the rebirth of the Hungarian culture.

The first printed book written in Hungarian was printed in Cracow, Poland, in 1533. It is a partial Bible-translation, containing the letters of Saint Paul. The translation was done by Benedek Komjáti. The New Testament's first printed edition was published by János Sylvester (1541). He also composed the first scientific analysis of the Hungarian language, in 1539 – his work's title is "Grammatica Hungarolatina". Like Komjáti, Sylvester printed his works in Cracow.

The previous publications, however, were not Protestant in their sense; the first directly reformed Hungarian book was Imre Ozorai's "Argument", published in Cracow first in 1535 and second in 1546.

Among other works, Aesop's Fables – a collection of moral short stories – were first translated into Hungarian by Gábor Pesti [1] (1536). These are the first denoted Hungarian short stories. The first attempt to standardize Hungarian was done by Mátyás Bíró Dévai. He proposed a logical and feasible orthography to the language. His book, called "Orthographia", is known from its second edition, printed in 1549.

==Prehistory==

===Separation from Common Uralic===
{{see also|Regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and other Uralic languages}}
The history of the [[Hungarian language]] begins with the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] era, in the [[Neolithic]] age, when the linguistic ancestors of all Uralic languages were living together, in the area of the [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref name="notgenetic"&gt;The speakers of the Uralic languages are not related genetically, only linguistically.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Hungarian words, particularly among the language's most basic vocabulary (cf. [[Swadesh list]]) are traced back to common Uralic origin: words of a corresponding shape occur in other Uralic languages as well and linguists have not been able to classify them as loanwords. Those that are not present in the [[Samoyedic languages]] are commonly also described as being of Finno-Ugric origin, but the existence of a definite distinction between "Uralic" and "Finno-Ugric" is disputed. (See [[Uralic languages#Family tree]].)

As the Uralic unity disintegrated between the 4th and the 2nd millennium BC, the speakers of Samoyedic languages moved eastwards, while others, such as the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and Hungarian speakers, moved westward. Hungarian and the [[Ob-Ugric languages]] show several similarities and are known as the Ugric group, which is commonly (but not universally) considered a proper sub-branch of Uralic: that is, the Hungarian and Ob-Ugric languages would descend from a common Proto-Ugric language. The speakers of Ugric languages were still living close together approximately until 1000 BC, when the ancestors of Hungarians separated for good from the Ob-Ugrians.

===Proto-Hungarian===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Around 1000 BC, the linguistic ancestors of the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] had moved southwest from their previous territories, the region west of the [[Ural Mountains]], the eastern frontier of [[Europe]]; hence the [[Hungarian language]] separated from its closest relatives, the [[Ob-Ugric languages]], a small group divided further into the [[Mansi language]] and the [[Khanty language]]. (This split may be occurred only later, and their speakers were influenced by an Asian, possibly Western-Siberian tribe, as the Mansies and Khanties had moved northeast.) Proto-Hungarian likely had contacts with the [[Permic languages]] at this time, as indicated by a nontrivial number of shared vocabulary and sound developments (which are ''not'' found in the other Uralic languages).

The Hungarians gradually changed their way of living from settled hunters to nomadic cattle-raising. Their most important animals included sheep and cattle. There are no written resources on the era, thus only a little is known about it.

After a long journey, the Hungarians had settled the coastal region of the northeastern [[Black Sea]], where they were significantly influenced by [[Turkic peoples]]. With the fall of [[Attila]]'s empire, the [[Huns]] had receded to this area, and established their new state, which also ruled over the Hungarians. Maybe a memoir of this is a Hungarian myth: the saga of [[Hunor and Magor]], who are said to be the common ancestors of the Huns and the Hungarians.

However, the Hunnish rule had not lasted long, as the Hungarians soon fell under [[Göktürk]] rule. The [[Göktürk]] Turk Empire flourished from the 6th century to the 8th century. This is very probably the time when the Hungarians were first exposed to the concept of [[writing]], through the Göktürks' mediation. The latter used the [[Orkhon script]] or Turkic runic script, and reputedly the [[Old Hungarian script]] (rovásírás) descends from it.

The Hungarians call themselves ''Magyar''s (pronounced like ''madyar'').  The name ''Magyar'' once was the name of a Hungarian tribe, ''Megyer(i)''. It likely means "talking man". The first syllable may be cognate to the ethnonym ''Mansi'', which in the [[Mansi language]] (''манси'' ''mańśi'') means simply 'man, Mansi'.

* The first element (''mogy-'') is likely from a [[Proto-Ugric]] ''*mańć-'' (“man, person”), also found in the name of the [[Mansi people|Mansi]] (e.g. Southern ''mäńćī'', Northern ''mańśi'', Western ''māńś'', ''måńś'').&lt;ref name="Starostin"&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=\data\uralic\uralet&amp;first=1&amp;text_proto=&amp;method_proto=substring&amp;ic_proto=on&amp;text_meaning=&amp;method_meaning=substring&amp;ic_meaning=on&amp;text_germmean=&amp;method_germmean=substring&amp;ic_germmean=on&amp;text_fin=&amp;method_fin=substring&amp;ic_fin=on&amp;text_est=&amp;method_est=substring&amp;ic_est=on&amp;text_saa=&amp;method_saa=substring&amp;ic_saa=on&amp;text_mrd=&amp;method_mrd=substring&amp;ic_mrd=on&amp;text_mar=&amp;method_mar=substring&amp;ic_mar=on&amp;text_udm=&amp;method_udm=substring&amp;ic_udm=on&amp;text_kom=&amp;method_kom=substring&amp;ic_kom=on&amp;text_khn=&amp;method_khn=substring&amp;ic_khn=on&amp;text_man=&amp;method_man=substring&amp;ic_man=on&amp;text_ugr=magyar&amp;method_ugr=substring&amp;ic_ugr=on&amp;text_smd=&amp;method_smd=substring&amp;ic_smd=on&amp;text_nen=&amp;method_nen=substring&amp;ic_nen=on&amp;text_enc=&amp;method_enc=substring&amp;ic_enc=on&amp;text_nga=&amp;method_nga=substring&amp;ic_nga=on&amp;text_slk=&amp;method_slk=substring&amp;ic_slk=on&amp;text_kam=&amp;method_kam=substring&amp;ic_kam=on&amp;text_janh=&amp;method_janh=substring&amp;ic_janh=on&amp;text_samm2=&amp;method_samm2=substring&amp;ic_samm2=on&amp;text_redei=&amp;method_redei=substring&amp;ic_redei=on&amp;text_add=&amp;method_add=substring&amp;ic_add=on&amp;text_reshet=&amp;method_reshet=substring&amp;ic_reshet=on&amp;text_yuk=&amp;method_yuk=substring&amp;ic_yuk=on&amp;text_lit=&amp;method_lit=substring&amp;ic_lit=on&amp;text_any=&amp;method_any=substring&amp;sort=number&amp;ic_any=on Sergei Starostin, Uralic etymology]&lt;/ref&gt; It may have also had a meaning of ‘speaker; messenger’. In this case, it may ultimately derive from [[Proto-Uralic]] ''*mënɜ-'' (“to say”), the original definition being preserved in ''magyaráz'' (“to explain”).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
* The second element ''-ër'' ‘man’, retained in ''emb'''er''''' ‘man’ and ''férj'' ‘husband’, is cognate with Mari ''erɣǝ'', ''erɣe'' ‘son, boy’ and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''yrkä'' (“man”). It is from Proto-Uralic ''*irkä'' or ''*ürkä'' (“man, son, boy”).&lt;ref name="Starostin"/&gt;

The external name Hungarian was recorded in the 13th century by Anonymous in the Gesta Hungarorum, as originating in the 9th century from the castle Ung (Hungu) now in Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesta_Hungarorum&lt;/ref&gt; 
     Et uocatus est arpad dux hungarie et ab hungu omnes sui milites uocatj sunt hunguarie... 
     ‘And Arpad was called duke of Hungarie from Hungu and his warriors were called Hunguarians...’

Later the Italians began using the phrase Hungarorum which first appears in the Song of the Watchmen of Modena in 924 AD.
     A sagittis Hungarorum libera nos Domine!
     ‘From the arrows of the Hungarians, O Lord deliver us!’

This may be a play on words taking the similarity of the word hunguarie to the name of the Huns, as Hungarorum could be divided "hun-garorum": garorum is plural for garum which was an Italian sauce made from fermented fish intestines.  It is the phrase Hungarorum and not hunguarie which then became the accepted term to refer to Hungarians as the title of the Hungarian chronicle Gesta Hungarorum attests to.  Anonymous also uses the singular form of the fish sauce reference in his prologue as the word Hungarum, "Incipit prologus in gesta hungarum".

The Hungarians also came into contact with the [[Khazars]]. After the Khazar empire collapsed, Magyars lived as an independent nation, moving westward. In 895–896, under the rulership of Prince [[Árpád]], they crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and settled the area of present-day [[Hungary]]. They also began to establish their own state here, namely the Principality of Hungary.

====Early loanwords====
There are some really early loanwords in Hungarian, which enriched the language's vocabulary, estimated to 25,000 words at the time. Here are some examples:

|-
! '''[[Permic languages|Permic]]'''
|
| ''agyar'' 'fang', ''daru'' 'crane', ''hagyma'' 'bulb'
|}

In the era of the Turkic influences, Hungarians developed especially culturally: the borrowed vocabulary consists of terms referring to sophisticated dressing, and the words of a learned upper class society. The phrases of basic literacy are also of Turkic origin. A number of words related to [[agriculture]] and [[viticulture]] have the same background.

====Phonetics====

The phonetic system of Hungarian went through large changes in the Old Hungarian period. The most important change was the disappearance of the original Uralic word-ending vowels, which eroded in many descendant languages (among others [[Finnish language|Finnish]], however, largely preserves these sounds; see the table on the right). Even so, declined forms of the nouns and inflected verbs of Uralic origin still show traces of the lost sounds: ''ló'' (horse)—''lo'''v'''as'' (rider); ''kő'' (stone)—''kö'''v'''es'' (stony). This was the process of ''phonetic reduction''. The earliest written records of Hungarian from the 9th century still show some retained word-final vowels, e.g. in ''hodu'' 'army' &gt; modern ''had''.

Possibly there had been also present a [[Close back unrounded vowel|velar ''ï'' sound]] as well, later replaced by a [[Close front unrounded vowel|palatal ''i'']]. Today, since Hungarian has [[vowel harmony]], some words containing the palatal sound ''i'' pick up the back suffix when conjugated or declined—instead of the front suffix, which is usual for ''i'''s of other origin. Some examples: ''nyíl'' (arrow) → ''nyil'''at''''' (accusative; instead of *''nyilet''); ''inni'' ([''v inf''], to drink) → ''iv'''ás''''' (drinking [''n''], instead of *''ivés'').

The transition from [[diphthongs]] to simple vowels had already begun in the Proto-Hungarian period.

=====Consonants=====
[[Plosive]]s between vowels developed to [[spirants]], and those after [[nasal stop]]s became [[voice (phonetics)|voice]]d:

====Grammar====
The language developed its interesting features, the transitive and intransitive verb conjugations. (See [[Hungarian grammar (verbs)]].) Marked possessive relations appeared. The accusative marker -''t'' was developed, as well as many [[verb tense]]s.

By the 10th century, the [[Hungarian people |Hungarians]] had established a principality in present-day [[Hungary]] and its neighbourhood. In 1000, Vajk — the later [[Stephen I of Hungary]] — got his [[The Crown|crown]] from the [[Papal State]], and the history of the Christian [[Kingdom of Hungary]] began.

In the 1490s, Hungarian was spoken by about 3.2 million people; this number was fairly high at the time. The first examples of official and legal use are dated back to these years. Some personal letters and wills are known. Nevertheless, the [[Ottoman Empire]] put pressure on neighbouring nations, just like on Hungary—the latter was unstable at the time, due to internal lordship debates. This led to the Hungarian (led by [[Louis II of Hungary]]) loss of the [[Battle of Mohács]] (1526). In 1541, Ottomans finally captured the capital, [[Buda]] as well. The country was split up to three parts; the southern regions fell under Ottoman rule; the western parts officially remained "Kingdom of Hungary", with Habsburg kings; and the eastern area, mainly [[Transylvania]] and the [[Partium]] became independent. Historical linguists set the end of the Old Hungarian period at 1526, as it is a such important date in Hungarian history.

===Literary records===

The [[Latin language]] was made official in the country—especially in the 11th to 15th centuries, the language of literature and religion was Latin. However, Hungarian was used in certain cases; sometimes it was fitted into Latin documents, to avoid later disputes about proprietary rights.

However, the first official document of Hungary is not in Latin, but in [[Greek language|Greek]]—this is the "Charter of the nuns of Veszprémvölgy",&lt;ref name=veszprem&gt;"''Veszprémvölgy''" is a place name, around present-day [[Veszprém]].&lt;/ref&gt; dated to 997. The text contains some Hungarian (and also some Slavic) place names: e.g. {{IPA|saɣarbrien}} (compound formed from {{IPA|saɣar}} 'shaft' + an obsolete Turkic [[loanword]], {{IPA|brien}} 'coalition'—today ''Szárberény''); {{IPA|saːmtaɣ}} 'plough'; {{IPA|meleɡdi}} (from ''meleg'' 'warm' + -''di'' diminutive suffix).

The next most important document is the "[[Establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany]]", dated to 1055. In the Latin text, 3 Hungarian sentences, 58 words, and 33 suffixes are present. The longest sentence is, in the original spelling, ''feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea'' (reconstructed pronunciation:{{cn|date=January 2018}} {{IPA|/fɛhɛːrvaːru reaː mɛnɛɣ hɔdu utu reaː/}}; modern Hungarian: "[[Székesfehérvár|Fehérvárra]] menő hadi útra"—the postposition "rea", meaning "onto", became the suffix "-ra/-re"—English: 'up to the military road going to [[Székesfehérvár|Fehérvár]]'). Today, the vellum is kept in the abbey of [[Pannonhalma]].

Skipping intermediate Hungarian relics, the next important point is the "[[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]]" from 1192. This is the first text completely in Hungarian. The document is found on the 154th page of the Codex Pray (Pray here is not English; it is a name). The sermon begins with the words ''Latiatuc feleym zumtuchel mic vogmuc. yſa pur eſ chomuv uogmuc'' ({{IPA|/laːtjaːtuk fɛlɛim symtyxːɛl mik vɔɟmuk iʃaː por eʃ xɔmou vɔɟmuk/}} — "Do you see, my friends, what we are: truly, we are only dust and ash.")

[[Hungarian literature|Literature in Hungarian]] is counted since the previous writing. The first known Hungarian poem has the title '[[Old Hungarian 'Lamentations of Mary'|Laments of Mary]]'—its theme is the story of [[Jesus]]' crucifixion, from the viewpoint of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. It was denoted around 1300, but possibly it is not the first version. Its text is clear, easy to understand and logical, free of [[latinism]]s. The first verse:
{|border=0
|width=50%|
{{IPA|vɔlɛːk ʃirɔlm tudɔtlɔn}}&lt;br/&gt;
{{IPA|ʃirɔlmol ʃɛpɛdik}}&lt;br/&gt;
{{IPA|buol ɔsuk, ɛpedɛk}}
|
I was lament-ignorant;&lt;br/&gt; I am suffering from lament,&lt;br/&gt; I am suffering, languishing from sorrow.
|}

The next important relic—with a cheerless history—is the "Fragment of Königsberg", dated approximately to the 1350s. This is the remains of the first known, explicitly proven Hungarian [[book]]. The codex had arrived at [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]], by the end of the century; there, because it was not understandable to the Polish bookbinder, it was chopped and used to bind a Latin book. The other important book from the time is the Codex Jókay; a 15th-century copy of an original from 1372. The codex is about the life of [[Francis of Assisi]].
[[Image:Codex of munchen - bible in hungarian.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A copy of the [[Hussite Bible]], in the Codex of Munich, dated to 1466]]
In the early 15th century, some non-comprehensive Latin-Hungarian dictionaries, or rather word lists, were composed. Some shorter texts are also known. The most important work is however the first translation of the [[Bible]]: the [[Hussite Bible]], dated to 1430. The Bible was translated by priests [[Tamás Pécsi]] and [[Bálint Ujlaki]]. They were affected by the concepts of [[Jan Hus]] during their university years (1399–1411) in [[Prague]]. The [[Inquisition]] pursued these concepts, and the translation was confiscated from the translators; regardless it became so popular that several authentic copies of the original survive.

More and more Hungarian books were written, most of them religious. Over and above the "Laments of Mary", the other important item of Old Hungarian poetry is ''Szabács viadala'' ("Fight of [[Šabac]]"). Reputedly it was denoted in the year of the battle (1476); in this, Hungarian troops led by King [[Matthias of Hungary]] had a glorious victory over the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army—its issue is secular. It is possibly a fragment of a longer poem. A quotation:

{|border=0
|width=45%|
{{IPA|dɛ ɑz feʎːøːl mondot paːl keneʒi}}&lt;br/&gt;
{{IPA|aːroknɑk meːʎʃeːɡeːt iɡen nezi}}&lt;br/&gt;
{{IPA|ki ʃɑbatʃ erøːʃ voltaːt ɛlmeːlːeː}}&lt;br/&gt;
{{IPA|honːeːɡ minemøː aːlɟuː kel mɛlːeː}}
|
But, [[Pál Kinizsi]] said about the thing,&lt;br/&gt;who was regarding the dike's depth;&lt;br/&gt;who knew the powerfulness of [[Šabac]]:&lt;br/&gt;what sort of cannons should be brought from where.
|}

Some [[Old Hungarian script]] inscriptions are also known, such as the "Alphabet of Nikolsburg" (1483) and a number of deciphered and undeciphered inscriptions.

===Linguistic changes===

====Vocabulary====
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
In this period, Hungarian developed several new words. One way this happened was through [[loanword]]s coming from languages whose speakers mediated the new concepts. On the other hand, internal word formation also took place, in which the words for new concepts were derived from earlier words.

Compared to Modern Hungarian, Old Hungarian was rich in derivative suffixes. Most of these suffixes are also derived from other suffixes, so they can be aligned in "suffix-bushes". There were numerous diminutive suffixes, non-productive in today's Hungarian, e.g. -''d'' ("{{IPA|holmo'''d'''}}", from "{{IPA|holom}}"—"tiny hill"); -''t'' (it left its trace in some geographic names) ''-n, -ny, -m'' (as in ''kicsi'''ny''''', from ''kicsi''—very little).

Forming compounds was also a way to coin new terms.

But then again, there are several loanwords dating back to the period 896–1526. Loans were mainly acquired from [[Slavic languages]] (for example, {{IPA|kiraːʎ}} 'king'), [[German language|German]] (e. g. {{IPA|hɛrtsɛɡ}} 'prince'), and [[Latin language|Latin]] (e. g., {{IPA|tɛmplom}} 'church'). As emerges from the previous examples, these words are primarily associated with Christianity and politics. Other loans are the names of animals living outside Hungary, terms of technology, and so on.

====Grammar====
;Verbs
Like English, Modern Hungarian has two verb tenses: past and nonpast. Futurity is expressed using the auxiliary verb ''foɡ''. However, Old Hungarian had six verb tenses: Past Narrative (Latin: praeteritum), Past Finite, Past Complex, Present, Future Simple, and Future Complex.

Past Narrative was marked using the suffixes ''-é'', ''-á'' in transitive and ''-e'', ''-a'' in intransitive. The tense was used to describe an array of past events originally. The verb ''várni'' 'to wait' conjugated in this tense:

|}

Future simple was expressed using the suffix -''nd''.&lt;ref name=fs&gt;Traces of future simple are still found in the language. The future suffix, -nd, is an element of the suffix -''andó/-endő'', used to derive a kind of participles. Example: ''elintézendő'' 'something that has to be administered in future'.&lt;/ref&gt; Future complex (the present-day future tense of the language) is conjugated in the following way:

: Infinitive + auxiliary verb 'fog'
: ''menni fog''—he/she is going to go

::''See also: [[Hungarian grammar (verbs)]]''.

== Middle Hungarian==
The first printed [[book]] written in Hungarian was published in [[Kraków]] in 1533, by [[Benedek Komjáti]]. The work's title is ''Az Szent Pál levelei magyar nyelven'' (In original spelling: ''Az zenth Paal leueley magyar nyeluen''), i.e. ''The letters of Saint Paul in the Hungarian language''. In the 17th century, the language was already very similar to its present-day form, although two of the past tenses were still used. [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] loans also appeared in the language by these years. Further Turkish words were borrowed during the [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman occupation]] of much of Hungary between 1541 and 1699.

===Linguistic changes===
The vowel system of Hungarian had developed roughly to its current shape by the 16th century. At its fullest the system included eight phonemes occurring both short and long:&lt;ref&gt;Kálmán 1972, 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!rowspan="2"| !! colspan="2"| Front !! rowspan="2"| Back 
|-
! &lt;small&gt;Illabial&lt;/small&gt; !! &lt;small&gt;Labial&lt;/small&gt;
|-
! Close

|-
! Mid
| e, eː || ø, øː || o, oː
|-
! Open /&lt;br/&gt;Open-mid
| ɛ, ɛː || || ɔ, aː 
|}
This largely symmetric system was complicated only by the presence of open illabial {{IPA|/aː/}} as the long counterpart of short {{IPA|/ɔ/}}. In modern Hungarian this is mainly found as a front vowel.

The contrasts between mid {{IPA|/e/}} and open-mid {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (including their long counterparts) have later been mostly lost. The shift {{IPA|/ɛː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/eː/}} took place widely during the 16th and 17th centuries, across most of the Hungarian-speaking area. In several dialects this however did not lead to a merger; in response, {{IPA|/eː/}} may have been either raised to {{IPA|/iː/}}, or (in northeastern dialects) [[Diphthongization|diphthongized]] to {{IPA|/ie/}}. The shift {{IPA|/e/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɛ/}} also arose equally early in the central dialects underlying Standard Hungarian. Its spread to the other Hungarian dialects has however been much slower, though the emergence of widespread [[literacy]] and [[mass media]] in the 20th century has supported its continuing adoption.&lt;!--clunky, reword?--&gt;

== Modern Hungarian==
In the late 18th century, the language was incapable of clearly expressing scientific concepts, and several writers found the vocabulary a bit scant for literary purposes. Thus, a group of writers, most notably [[Ferenc Kazinczy]], began to compensate for these imperfections. Some words were shortened (''győzedelem'' &gt; ''győzelem'', 'triumph' or 'victory'); a number of [[dialect]]al words spread nationally (e. g. ''cselleng'' 'dawdle'); extinct words were reintroduced (''dísz'' 'décor'); a wide range of expressions were coined using the various derivative suffixes; and some other, less frequently used methods of expanding the language were utilized. This movement was called the '[[language reform]]' (Hungarian: ''nyelvújítás,'' lit. "language renewal"), and produced more than ten thousand words, many of which are used actively today. The reforms led{{Citation needed|reason=was this surely the main reason?|date=March 2009}} to the installment of Hungarian as the official language over Latin in the multiethnic country in 1844.

The 19th and 20th centuries saw further standardization of the language, and differences between the already mutually comprehensible dialects gradually lessened. In 1920, by signing the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Hungary lost 71% of its territories, and along with these, 33% of the ethnic Hungarian population. Today, the language is official in Hungary, and regionally also [[Hungarian minority in Romania|in Romania]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], and [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Serbia]].

Ye see, my brethren, with your eyes, what we are! Behold, we are dust and ashes. Through His divine grace the Lord God first made our ancestor, Adam, and gave him the Paradise of Eden for his home. And of all the fruits of Paradise, He bade him live, forbidding to him only the fruit of one tree, yet telling him, why he should not eat of it: "Lo, on the day thou eatest of this fruit, thou shalt die the death of deaths." Adam had heard of his death from his Creator-God, yet he forgot. He yielded to the Devil’s allurement, and ate of the forbidden fruit, and in that fruit he partook of death. And so bitter was the juice of that fruit, it (almost?) burst their throats. Not only for himself, but for all his race he ate death. In anger, God cast him into this world of toil, and he became the nest of death and damnation, for all his kind. Who shalt be those? We are them.

'''Hwanung''' ([[Korean language|Korean]] for the "Supreme Divine Regent") is an important figure in the mythological origins of [[Korea]]. He plays a central role in the story of [[Dangun]] Wanggeom (단군왕검/{{lang|ko|檀君王儉}}), the legendary founder of [[Gojoseon]], the first kingdom of Korea.  Hwanung is the son of [[Hwanin]] (환인; {{lang|ko|桓因}}), the "Lord of Heaven". Along with his ministers of clouds, rain, and wind, he instituted laws and moral codes and taught the humans various arts, medicine, and agriculture.

==Creation myth==
According to the Dangun creation myth, Hwanung yearned to live on the earth among the valleys and the mountains. Hwanin permitted Hwanung and 3000 followers to depart and they descended from heaven to a [[sandalwood]] tree on [[Baekdu Mountain]], then called [[Taebaek Mountains|Taebaek Mountain]] (태백산/{{lang|ko|太伯山}}).  There Hwanung founded [[Sinsi]] (신시/{{lang|ko|神市}}, "City of God") and gave himself the title Heaven King. In a cave near the sandalwood tree lived a bear and a tiger who came to the tree every day to pray to Hwanung. One day Hwanung gave the bear and the tiger twenty bulbs of garlic and some divine [[mugwort]].  Hwanung promised if they ate only his garlic and mugwort and stayed in the cave out of the sunlight for one hundred days he would make them human.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tiger and the bear agreed and went back to the cave, but tiger was too hungry and impatient to wait, leaving the cave before the 100 days were done.  But the bear remained, and on the 21st day was transformed into a beautiful woman, who gratefully honored Hwanung with offerings.  With time the woman grew lonely, and prayed to Hwanung that she might have a child.  So Hwanung made her his wife and gave her a son called Dangun, a name which has two meanings: "Altar Prince" and sandalwood.  Dangun eventually founded [[Gojoseon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stocker|2009|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intestacy''' is the condition of the [[estate (law)|estate]] of a person who dies without having made a valid [[Will and testament|will]] or other binding declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intestacy|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intestacy|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively this may also apply where a will or declaration has been made, but only applies to part of the estate; the remaining estate forms the "intestate estate". Intestacy law, also referred to as the '''law of descent and distribution''', refers to the body of law ([[Statute|statutory]] and [[case law]]) that determines who is entitled to the property from the estate under the rules of [[inheritance]].

==History and the common law==
Intestacy has a limited application in those jurisdictions that follow [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or [[Roman law]] because the concept of a will is itself less important; the doctrine of [[forced heirship]] automatically gives a deceased person's [[next-of-kin]] title to a large part (forced estate) of the estate's property [[by operation of law]], beyond the power of the deceased person to defeat or exceed by testamentary gift. A forced share (or [[legitime]]) can often only be decreased on account of some very specific misconduct by the forced [[heir]]. In matters of cross-border inheritance, the "laws of succession" is the commonplace term covering testate and intestate estates in common law jurisdictions together with forced heirship rules typically applying in civil law and [[Sharia law]] jurisdictions.
After the [[Statute of Wills]] 1540, Englishmen (and unmarried or widowed women) could dispose of their lands and [[real property]] by a ''will''. Their [[personal property]] could formerly be disposed of by a ''testament'', hence the hallowed legal [[merism]] ''last will and testament''.

Common law sharply distinguished between [[real property]] and [[Personal property|chattel]]s. Real property for which no disposition had been made by will passed by the law of [[kinship and descent]]; chattel property for which no disposition had been made by testament was [[escheat]] to [[the Crown]], or given to the Church for charitable purposes. This law became obsolete as England moved from being a [[feudal]] to a [[mercantile]] society, and chattels more valuable than land were being accumulated by townspeople.

==Rules==
Where a person dies without leaving a will, the rules of succession of the person's place of [[habitual residence]] or of their [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] often apply, but it is also common for the principality where the property is located to have jurisdiction regardless of the decedent's residence or domicile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intestate Succession – Where does everything go without a Will?|url=http://www.curnalialaw.com/blog/pauperplanning/intestate-succession-where-does-everything-go-without-a-will/|website=Pauper Planning Techniques|publisher=Curnalia Law, LLC|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain jurisdictions such as [[France]], [[Switzerland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana]], and much of the [[Islamic world]], entitlements arise whether or not there was a will. These are known as ''[[forced heir]]ship'' rights and are not typically found in [[common law]] jurisdictions, where the rules of succession without a will (intestate succession) play a back-up role where an individual has not (or has not fully) exercised his or her right to dispose of property in a will.

==Current law==
In most contemporary common-law [[jurisdiction]]s, the law of intestacy is patterned after the common law of descent. Property goes first or in major part to a spouse, then to [[child]]ren and their descendants; if there are no descendants, the rule sends you back up the family tree to the parents, the siblings, the siblings' descendants, the grandparents, the parents' siblings, and the parents' siblings' descendants, and usually so on further to the more remote degrees of kinship. The operation of these laws varies from one jurisdiction to another.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
In [[England and Wales]] the Intestacy Rules have been uniform since 1925 and similar rules apply in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Republic of Ireland]] and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and [[Crown dependencies]]. These rules have been supplemented by the discretionary provisions of the [[Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975]] so that fair provision can be made for a dependent spouse or other relative where the strict divisions set down in the intestacy rules would produce an unfair result, for example by providing additional support for a dependent minor or disabled child vis-a-vis an adult child who has a career and no longer depends on their parent.

The rules of succession are the Intestacy Rules set out in the [[Administration of Estates Act]] and associated legislation. The Act sets out the order for distribution of property in the estate of the deceased. For persons with surviving children and a wealth below a certain threshold (£250,000 as from February 2009), the whole of the estate will pass to the deceased's spouse or also, from December 2005, their [[civil partnership in the United Kingdom|registered civil partner]]. For persons with no surviving children but surviving close relatives (such as siblings or parents), the first £450,000 goes to the spouse or civil partner (as from February 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Family Provision (Intestate Succession) Order 2009 (S.I. 2009 No. 135)&lt;/ref&gt; Such transfers below the threshold are exempt from UK [[inheritance tax]].

If a person dies intestate with no identifiable heirs, the person's estate generally [[escheat]]s (i.e. is legally assigned) to [[the Crown]] (via the [[Bona vacantia]] division of the [[Treasury Solicitor]]) or to the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] or [[Duchy of Lancaster]] when the deceased was a resident of either; in limited cases a discretionary distribution might be made by one of these bodies to persons who would otherwise be without entitlement under strict application of the rules of inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Discretionary Grants in Estates Cases|url=http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/Discretionary-Grants-in-Estates-Cases.aspx|website=The Treasury Solicitor, Bona Vacantia Division|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=6 September 2017|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091003153017/http://www.bonavacantia.gov.uk/output/Discretionary-Grants-in-Estates-Cases.aspx|archivedate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For deaths after 1 October 2014, the current rules where someone dies leaving a spouse or civil partner are as follows:

* If there are no children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren then the spouse or civil partner inherits the entire estate.
*If there are children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren, the spouse receives the personal possessions and the first £250,000, then half of everything else passing under the intestacy rules. The other half passes to the children equally at 18, with provision for grandchildren whose parents have died before the intestate deceased.

In larger estates, the spouse will not receive the entire estate where the deceased left other blood relatives and left no will. They will receive the following:

*all property passing to them by survivorship (such as the deceased's share in the jointly owned family home);
*all property passing to them under the terms of a trust (such as a life insurance policy);
*a statutory legacy of a fixed sum (being a larger sum where the deceased left no children); and
*a life interest in half of the remaining estate.

The children (or more distant relatives if there are no children) of the deceased will be entitled to half of the estate remaining immediately and the remaining half on the death of the surviving spouse. Where no beneficiaries can be traced, see [[bona vacantia]].

====Scotland====
The law on intestacy in [[Scotland]] broadly follows that of England and Wales with some variations. A notable difference is that all possible (blood) relatives can qualify for benefit (i.e. they are not limited to grandparents or their descendants). Once a class is 'exhausted', succession continues to the next line of ascendants, followed by siblings, and so on. In a complete absence of relatives of the whole or half-blood, the estate passes to the Crown (as ''[[ultimus haeres]]''). The Crown has a discretion to benefit people unrelated to the intestate, e.g. those with moral claims on the estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorham|first1=John|title=A Comparison of the English and Scottish Rules of Intestacy|url=http://www.trustees.org.uk/review-index/Intestacy-A-comparison-of-the-English-and-Scottish-rules-of-intestacy.php|website=The Association of Corporate Trustees|accessdate=6 September 2017|date=8 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada the laws vary from province to province. As in England, most jurisdictions apply rules of intestate succession to determine [[next of kin]] who become legal heirs to the estate. Also, as in England, if no identifiable heirs are discovered, the property may [[escheat]] to the government.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===United States===
In the United States intestacy laws vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Probate Process|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/real_property_trust_estate/resources/estate_planning/the_probate_process.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the separate states uses its own intestacy laws to determine the ownership of residents' intestate property. Attempts in the United States to make probate and intestate succession uniform from state to state, through efforts such as the [[Uniform Probate Code]], have been met with limited success.

The distribution of the property of an intestate decedent is the responsibility of the ''administrator'' (or ''personal representative'') of the estate: typically the administrator is chosen by the court having jurisdiction over the decedent's property, and is frequently (but not always) a person nominated by a majority of the decedent's heirs.

Federal law controls intestacy of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25 U.S. Code § 2206 - Descent and distribution|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/2206|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states have adopted all or part of the Uniform Probate Code, but often with local variations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPC Chart (Excerpted from “Record of Passage of Uniform and Model Acts, as of September 30, 2010)|url=http://www.uniformlaws.org/Shared/Docs/Probate%20Code/UPC%20Chart.pdf|website=Uniform Law Commission|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ohio]], the law of intestate succession has been modified significantly from the common law, and has been essentially codified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title XXI, Courts - Probate - Juvenile, Chapter 2015, Descent and Distribution|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2105|website=Ohio Revised Code|publisher=State of Ohio|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] also has codified its intestacy law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCW 11.04.015|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?Cite=11.04.015|website=Revised Code of Washington|publisher=Washington State Legislature|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] has perhaps the most complicated law of descent of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Code, Estates, Powers &amp; Trusts, Sec. 4-1.1. Descent and distribution of a decedent's estate|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EPT/4-1.1|website=The New York Senate|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eager|first1=Samuel Watkins|title=Descent and distribution : intestate succession in the state of New York|date=1926|publisher=Matthew Bender &amp; Co.|location=Albany, NY|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/descent-and-distribution-intestate-succession-in-the-state-of-new-york/oclc/5514327?tab=details|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida's intestacy statute permits the heirs of a deceased spouse of the decedent to inherit, in the event that the decedent has no other heirs.

==Life==
Bevir was born in London. His family was broadly [[humanism|humanist]] and impressed upon Bevir the importance of reading, self-expression and seeking personal growth. Bevir was educated at the [[University of Exeter]] and [[Oxford University]]. He lectured at the [[University of Madras]] and at [[Newcastle University]] before he moved to Berkeley. He has been a visiting fellow at universities in Australia, Finland, France, the UK, and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Skodo | first = Admir | url=http://figureground.org/interview-with-mark-bevir | title=Interview with Mark Bevir | publisher = Figure / Ground Communication |date = 4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark is an atheist. 

==Work==
Bevir has published extensively in philosophy, history, and political science literatures.  His interests are diverse, including Anglophone, continental, and South Asian thought, particularly radical, socialist, and [[critical theory]] of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Philosophical concerns include [[postanalytic philosophy|postanalytic]] approaches to subjectivity, social inquiry, ethics, and democratic theory.

===Philosophy of history===
Bevir is the author of ''The Logic of the History of Ideas'' (1999), which builds on the work of analytic philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] to "undertake a normative study of the forms of reasoning appropriate to the history of ideas".  His approach is intended to complement, and not directly oppose, the [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School]] of history of political thought which focuses on recovering meanings of historical texts, and [[hermeneutic]] theorists concerned with the phenomenology of understanding.  Rather, Bevir introduces the idea of a normative approach that hinges on using traditions and dilemmas to understand beliefs and more complex webs of meaning, key concepts that underpin his work on interpretive political science and governance theory.

===Interpretivism===
Mark Bevir and [[R. A. W. Rhodes]] are the authors of ''Interpreting British Governance'' (2003), ''Governance Stories'' (2006), and ''The State as Cultural Practice'' (2010).  They argue that political science must necessarily be an interpretive art.  This is because they hold that the starting point of enquiry must be to unpack the meanings, beliefs, and preferences of actors to then make sense of understanding actions, practices, and institutions.  Political science is therefore an interpretative discipline underpinned by hermeneutic philosophy rather than positivism: there is no ‘science’ of politics, instead all explanations, including those that deploy statistics and models, are best conceived as narratives.  Bevir and Rhodes thus provide an elaborate philosophical foundation for a decentred theory of governance woven together by the notions of beliefs, traditions and dilemmas. 'It follows that the role of political scientists is to use (1) ethnography to uncover people’s beliefs and preferences, and (2) history to uncover traditions as they develop in response to dilemmas.  The product is a story of other people’s constructions of what they are doing, which provides actors’ views on changes in government, the economy, and society.  So, for example, a political scientist may select a part of the governance process, and then explain it by unpicking various political traditions and how actors within these traditions encounter and act to resolve dilemmas.  Governance is thus understood as the contingent and unintended outcome of competing narratives of governance.'&lt;ref name="sagepub194"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bevir | first = Mark | title = Encyclopedia of governance | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781412905794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance===
Bevir first published his decentred theory of governance in a 2003 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bevir|first=Mark|editor1-last=Bang|editor1-first=Henrik|title= Governance as Social and Political Communication|chapter=A Decentred Theory of Governance|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he published a book length version that applied the theory to both different organizational types and the changing nature of public action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bevir|first=Mark|year=2013|title=A Theory of Governance|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his collaborations with Rhodes, Bevir applied the theory mainly to Britain.

The theory draws on Bevir's earlier work on the philosophy of history to develop a particular account of the state and of political action. It suggests that the modern state is dispersed, lacking an essence or center. It suggests that political action embodies the meanings and beliefs that people reach as they draw on inherited traditions to respond to new dilemmas.

In her short account, Claire Donovan explains that "For Bevir and Rhodes, decentered theory revolves around the idea of situated agency: institutions, practices or socialisation cannot determine how people behave, so any course of action is a contingent individual choice. People’s actions are explained by their beliefs (or meanings or desires); any one belief is interpreted in the context of the wider web of a person’s beliefs; and these beliefs are explained by traditions and modified by dilemmas. A tradition (or episteme or paradigm) is the set of theories against the background of which a person comes to hold beliefs and perform actions. It is a first influence upon people – a set of beliefs that they inherit and then transform in response to encounters with "dilemmas" (or problems or anomalies).  A dilemma arises whenever novel circumstances generate a new belief that forces people to question their previously held beliefs.  Change occurs through encountering such dilemmas: while individual responses to dilemmas are grounded in traditions, they then modify just those traditions."&lt;ref name="sagepub194"/&gt;

Bevir argues that decentred theory supports democratic participation and pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevir|first=Mark|year=2010|title=Democratic Governance|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Marxists like [[Aletta Norval]] have also adopted decentred theory, arguing it supports democratic learning and agonistic politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Griggs|editor1-first=Steven|editor2-last=Norval|editor2-first=Aletta|editor3-last=Wagenaar|editor3-first=Hendrik|year=2014|title=Practices of Freedom: Decentred Governance, Conflict and Democratic Participation|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual history===
Bevir wrote his Ph.d. thesis at the University of Oxford on the history of British socialism. He published a number of articles on the topic and then ''The Making of British Socialism'' (2011). Bevir rejects accounts of socialism that emphasise class consciousness. He argues that British socialism arose as people revised various traditions in response to economic and religious dilemmas. Socialism has diverse strands rooted in distinct traditions including Tory radicalism, romanticism, liberalism, and positivism. Bevir's emphasis on the diversity of socialism is meant to correct the twentieth century association of socialism with the labour movement and with state intervention. He suggests that earlier socialists focused on social justice, radical democratic schemes, and utopian personal and social transformations.

'''Old Europe''' is a term coined by archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] to describe what she perceived as a relatively homogeneous '''pre-Indo-European''' [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] culture in southeastern Europe located in the [[Danube River]] valley,&lt;ref&gt; Jacques Leslie, [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-11/magazine/tm-2975_1_marija-gimbutas-gods-of-old-europe-indo-european The Goddess Theory: Controversial UCLA Archeologist Marija Gimbutas Argues That the World Was at Peace When God Was a Woman], [[Los Angeles Times]], June 11, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Sharpe, [http://www.archaeology.org/issues/90-1305/trenches/750-danube-gorges-colonizing-neolithic-farmers-strontium Europe's First Farmers], Archaeology, a publication of the Archaeological Institute of America,  April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Thompson, [http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/leisure/archive/theatre_art/photography/8207466.The_Lost_World_of_Old_Europe__the_Danube_Valley__5000_3500BC__The_Ashmolean_Museum/ The Lost World of Old Europe: the Danube Valley, 5000-3500BC, The Ashmolean Museum], The Oxford Times,  June 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[Danubian culture]].

In a major work, ''The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe: Myths and Cult Images'' (1974),&lt;ref name=MG-2007&gt;Reissued as {{cite book|last1=Gimbutas|first1=Marija|title=The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe: Myths and Cult Images|date=September 1, 2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-52025398-8|edition=2 New Upd|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zKFFOoPlyjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Goddesses+and+Gods+of+Old+Europe&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EpOvVO0fxKtR4PeA0AM&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Goddesses%20and%20Gods%20of%20Old%20Europe&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; she refers to these Neolithic cultures as ''Old Europe'' (''[[Neolithic Europe]]'' and ''Pre-Indo-European'' are synonymous).  [[Archaeologist]]s and [[ethnographer]]s working within her framework believe that the evidence points to later [[Indo-European migrations|migrations and invasions]] of the peoples who spoke [[Indo-European languages]] at the beginning of the [[Bronze age]] (the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]).

==Old Europe==
Old Europe, or Neolithic Europe, refers to the time between the [[Mesolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] periods in [[Europe]], roughly from 7000 BCE (the approximate time of the first farming societies in [[Greece]]) to ca. 1700 BCE (the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in [[northwest Europe]]). The duration of the [[Neolithic]] varies from place to place: in [[southeast Europe]] it is approximately 4000 years (i.&amp;nbsp;e., 7000&amp;ndash;3000 BCE); in [[North-West Europe]] it is just under 3000 years (ca. 4500&amp;ndash;1700 BCE).

Regardless of specific chronology, many European Neolithic groups share basic characteristics, such as living in small-scale, family-based{{Citation needed | date =August 2011}} communities, more egalitarian than the [[city-states]] and [[chiefdoms]] of the [[Bronze Age]],  subsisting on [[domesticated|domestic]] plants and animals supplemented with the collection of wild plant foods and hunting, and producing hand-made pottery, without the aid of the [[potter's wheel]]. There are also many differences, with some Neolithic communities in southeastern Europe living in heavily fortified settlements of 3,000–4,000 people (e.g., [[Sesklo]] in Greece) whereas Neolithic groups in [[Great Britain|Britain]] were small (possibly 50–100 people) and highly mobile cattle-herders.

[[Marija Gimbutas]] investigated the Neolithic period in order to understand cultural developments in settled village culture in the southern Balkans, which she characterized as peaceful, [[matrilineality|matrilineal]], and possessing a goddess-centered religion. In contrast, she characterizes the later Indo-European influences as warlike, nomadic, and patrilineal. Using evidence from pottery and sculpture, and combining the tools of [[archaeology]], comparative [[mythology]], [[linguistics]], and, most controversially, [[folkloristics]], Gimbutas invented a new interdisciplinary field, [[archaeomythology]].

In historical times, some [[ethnonym]]s are believed to correspond to Pre-Indo-European peoples, assumed to be the descendants of the earlier Old European cultures: the [[Pelasgian]]s, [[Minoans]], [[Leleges]], [[Iberian language|Iberians]], [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragic people]], [[Etruscans]] and [[Basque people|Basques]]. Two of the three pre-Greek peoples of Sicily, the [[Sicani|Sicans]] and the [[Elymians]], may also have been pre-Indo-European. The term "Pre-Indo-European" is sometimes extended to refer to [[Asia Minor]] and [[Central Asia]], in which case the [[Hurrians]] and [[Urartu|Urartians]] are sometimes included.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

How many Pre-Indo-European languages existed is not known. Nor is it known whether the ancient names of peoples descended from the pre-ancient population actually referred to speakers of distinct languages. [[Marija Gimbutas]] (1989), observing a unity of symbols marked especially on pots, but also on other objects, concluded that there may have been a single language spoken in Old Europe. She thought that decipherment would have to wait for the discovery of bilingual texts.

The idea of a Pre-Indo-European language in the region precedes Gimbutas. It went by other names, such as "[[Pelasgians|Pelasgian]]", "Mediterranean", or "Aegean". Apart from marks on artifacts, the main evidence concerning Pre-Indo-European language is in names: [[toponym]]s, [[ethnonym]]s, etc., and in roots in other languages believed to be derived from one or more prior languages, possibly unrelated. Reconstruction from the evidence is an accepted, though somewhat speculative, field of study. Suggestions of possible Old European languages include '''Urbian''' by Sorin Paliga,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paliga|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vasconic substratum hypothesis]] of [[Theo Vennemann]] (also see [[Sigmund Feist]]'s [[Germanic substrate hypothesis]]), and [[Tyrsenian languages]] of Helmut Rix.

==Indo-European origins==
{{see also|Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses}}
According to Gimbutas' version of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], Old Europe was invaded and destroyed by horse-riding [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomads]] from the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] (the "[[Kurgan]] culture") who brought with them violence, [[patriarchy]], and [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anthony|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent proponents of the Kurgan hypothesis agree that the cultures of Old Europe spoke [[pre-Indo-European languages]] but include a less dramatic transition, with a prolonged migration of Proto-Indo-European speakers after Old Europe's collapse because of other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallory|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anthony|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Renfrew]]'s competing [[Anatolian hypothesis]] suggests that the Indo-European languages were spread across Europe by the first farmers from [[Anatolia]]. In the hypothesis' original formulation, the languages of Old Europe belonged to the Indo-European family but played no special role in its transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Renfrew's most recent revision of the theory, however, Old Europe was a "secondary [[urheimat]]" where the [[Hellenic languages|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] language families diverged around 5000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent genetic evidence from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona favors Gimbutas’ Kurgan hypothesis over Renfrew’s Anatolian hypothesis. &lt;ref&gt;Science News.  2015.  “Genetic Study Revives Debate on Origin and Expansion of Indo-European Languages in Europe.”  March 4, 2015. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150304075334.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lead up and planning==
Kenya's incursion into southern Somalia started after the kidnapping of two Spanish women, who were working for [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] at the [[Dadaab]] refugee camp. The abductions were allegedly carried out by Al Shabaab militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE79F00T20111016 |title=Kenyan ramps up security at Somali border, eyes al Shabaab |last=Ali |first=Noor |agency=Reuters |date=16 October 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Médecins Sans Frontières issued a press statement at the time disassociating itself from any armed activities and related declarations launched following the abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Médecins Sans Frontières seeks swift release of two abducted staff without use of force and continues medical activities to assist Somali population|url=http://www.msf.org/article/m%C3%A9decins-sans-fronti%C3%A8res-seeks-swift-release-two-abducted-staff-without-use-force-and|publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenyan government claimed its troop deployment had received approval from the [[Transitional Federal Government]] of Somalia (TFG).&lt;ref name="Ftskiis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15446110 |title=France to support Kenya's incursion into Somalia |publisher=BBC News |date=25 October 2011 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya's Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Moses Wetangula]], stated that the deployment of Kenyan troops was at the request of the TFG.&lt;ref name="Tssgskfm"/&gt; The Kenyan military said that there was no set exit date for the operation, but the indicator of the mission's success would be a crippling of Al-Shabaab's capacity.&lt;ref name="aj29"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111029163441395507.html |title=No exit date for Kenyan mission in Somalia |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=29 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "several sources agree[...] that the Kenyan intervention plan was discussed and decided in 2010, then finalised with input from western partners, including the US and to a lesser extent France", with Nairobi using the kidnappings "as an excuse to launch an operation ready and waiting."&lt;ref name="Rémy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rémy|first=Jean-Philippe|title=Kenya develops plan for satellite region of Jubaland on Somali border|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/08/somali-fears-in-kenya-conflicts|work=The Guardian |accessdate=13 November 2011|location=London|date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 October Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua said Linda Nchi was planned months in advance and had been "going on for quite some time", as well as denied any participation by western forces.&lt;ref name=Srcuka&gt;{{cite news|title=Somali rebel commander urges Kenya attacks|url=https://news.yahoo.com/kenya-vows-defeat-shebab-attack-135315433.html |publisher=Yahoo!

On 16 October, [[Reuters]] reported that Somali and Kenyan military officials had met over the weekend for talks in the town of [[Dhobley (Lower Juba Region)|Dhobley]], situated in Somalia near the Kenya border. According to an unidentified security source, "the meeting was to prepare a joint operation between the two forces&amp;nbsp;... to launch an offensive against Al-Shabaab rebels who are scattered in different parts of southern Somalia".&lt;ref name="Npklois"&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/10/16/kenya-launches-offensive-in-somalia/ Kenya launches offensive in Somalia]. ''National Post''. (16 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==16 October incursion==
On 16 October, an unnamed Somali military commander said that Kenyan troops had crossed the border and, in a joint operation with Somali forces, pushed Al Shabaab out of two bases near the Kenya border. Abdi Yusuf, a senior Somali military commander, confirmed that two warplanes had attacked Al Shabaab bases, but did not confirm their origin. He noted: "I can't identify the military aircraft, but our neighbour Kenya is fully supporting us militarily and our mission is to drive Al-Shabaab out of the region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/somaliaNews/idAFL5E7LG0J320111016|agency=Reuters|date=16 October 2011|accessdate=16 October 2011|title=Kenya, Somali troops target al Shabaab bases in Somalia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia's ambassador to Kenya, Mohamed Ali Nur, responded "We cannot condone any country crossing our border."&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; TFG spokesman Abdirahman Omar Yarisow later contradicted Nur, asserting that "the governments of Somalia and Kenya are now cooperating in the fight against Al-Shabaab."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualites/2/monde/l-armee-kenyane-intervient-en-somalie-contre-al-chabaab_1041218.html | title=L'armée kényane intervient en Somalie contre Al Chabaab | agency=Reuters |language=french | date=16 October 2011 | accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperative agreement==

===Signing===
On 18 October, Somalia's President [[Sharif Sheikh Ahmed]] and other TFG officials hosted a Kenyan delegation in [[Mogadishu]] to discuss security co-operation against Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="Srkasatfas"&gt;[http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/1790/Kenya_and_Somalia_Agree_to_Fight_Al-Shabaab Kenya and Somalia Agree to Fight Al-Shabaab] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215212149/http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/1790/Kenya_and_Somalia_Agree_to_Fight_Al-Shabaab |date=15 February 2015 }}. Somaliareport.com (18 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia's Defence Minister [[Hussein Arab Isse]] and Kenya's Defence Minister [[Mohamed Yusuf Haji]] then signed an agreement to collaborate against Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="Spsoaki"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3347755.htm Somali President speaks out against Kenyan invasion]. Australian Broadcasting Corporation.au (4 May 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries pledged to "co-operate in undertaking security and military operations", including "co-ordinated pre-emptive action".&lt;ref name="aj19"/&gt; The agreement reportedly restricted Kenyan activities to the southern [[Lower Juba]] region.&lt;ref name="Spoka"&gt;[http://www.skynews.com.au/world/article.aspx?id=677494&amp;vId= Somali president opposes Kenyan assault]. Sky News.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite media reports claiming otherwise, Kenyan Defence Minister Yusuf Haji denied the involvement of the Kenyan military in the capture by TFG forces of some Al-Shabaab bases in Lower Juba. He added that "Kenya trained more TFG troops in the past and they are battling now against al-Shabaab in southern Somalia regions and we are giving them both logistical and financial support." Somalia's Defence Minister Isse welcomed Kenya's participation, stating that Somalia "need[ed] the support of Kenya so that our forces will be able to end al-Shabaab or any other threats against both Kenya and Somalia".&lt;ref name="Srkasatfas"/&gt;

===Opposition to the pact===
On 24 October, President Ahmed stated again that although he welcomed Kenyan logistical support, he was against the Kenyan military presence.&lt;ref name="Ftskiis"/&gt; These statements before the press appeared to contradict the signed cooperative agreement between the Somali and Kenyan Defence ministers on 18 October.&lt;ref name="Spoka"/&gt; Ahmed claimed his administration and people in Somalia opposed the presence of Kenyan troops since the Somali federal government "had no agreement with Kenya beyond helping us with logistics".&lt;ref name="Spsoaki"/&gt; According to media, Ahmed's remarks may have stemmed from fears that the Kenyan government supported the establishment of an autonomous [[Jubaland]] in the south of Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21534828 |title=A Big Gamble |work=The Economist |date=29 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed had reportedly previously protested the deployment of 2500 Somalis trained in Kenya to southern Somalia, arguing that the forces be sent to Mogadishu to support the TFG there.&lt;ref name="StarKe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/national/national/46425-why-somali-president-wants-kenya-army-out |title=Why Somali President Wants Kenya Army Out |publisher=Nairobi Star |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A leaked 2010 cable detailing a meeting between the TFG and the United States government (USG) stated that "Sharif offered a qualified "yes" when asked if he supported the [Government of Kenya's (GOK)] Lower Juba initiative" and that he "told the GOK that the TFG did not want to see Somalia further divided[...] The GOK had reassured the TFG that it also did not want to see Somalia divided and that it intended to use the troops now being trained in Kenya for a national not a regional mission." The cable also suggested that "[Ahmed's] qualified willingness to support the long-incubated Kenyan Lower Juba initiative at this meeting was at variance with the skepticism he had expressed to Somalia Unit in Nairobi about two weeks ago", where Sharif "suggested that the troops in training at Isiolo did not have broad-based clan representation and speculated that it might be better to bring them to Mogadishu and integrate them into existing TFG security forces. He also in that meeting seemed more skeptical of the GOK's ability to manage a cross-border offensive." In addition, the cable stated that "Sharif predicted that efforts to reform TFG security forces in Mogadishu, TFG outreach to ASWJ, and troops trained by Kenya and Ethiopia would coalesce into a comprehensive effort to push Al-Shabaab out of south central Somalia."&lt;ref name="USgovcable"&gt;{{cite web|title=Under Secretary For Democracy And Global Affairs Maria Otero's January 31, 2010, Meeting with the Tfg President|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=10ADDISABABA167|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister of Somalia [[Abdiweli Mohamed Ali]] reportedly disowned any pact that the Somali authorities had with the Kenyan government to cross the border into Somalia, stating that "We do not have agreement with Kenya. We understand that we need to defend against the militants but there is no proof saying that we agreed with Kenya".&lt;ref name="Kspmatep"/&gt; He dismissed media reports suggesting he disagreed with the President.&lt;ref name="Arspwkto"&gt;[http://www.africareview.com/News/Somali+President+wants+Kenya+troops+out/-/979180/1262236/-/lehvaq/-/index.html Somali President wants Kenya troops out]. Africareview.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The two issued a joint statement on 27 October denying any agreement between the TFG and the Kenyan government to allow the Kenyan incursion into Somalia.&lt;ref name="StarKe"/&gt;
In allusion to a cooperative agreement with the Kenyan government reached before the 18 October Mogadishu pact, Somali Defence Minister Isse also indicated that "the Somali Government and the Kenyan ministers only agreed to tackle the fighting against Al-Shabaab jointly by Kenya supporting the Somali forces."&lt;ref name="Arspwkto"/&gt;

The opposition to Kenya's action was criticised by some other TFG officials, militia allied to the TFG, and many ordinary Somalis.&lt;ref name="StarKe"/&gt; Many felt that Sharif did not fully understand the negative impact of Al-Shabaab's actions on the general public. Protests reportedly took place in the towns of Dhobley, [[Tabto]] and [[Qoqani]], areas where Kenyan troops had passed through.&lt;ref name="Ftskiis"/&gt; His position reportedly conflicted with that of some Somali military and TFG officials, the latter of whom considered the deployment of Kenyan troops to be an extension of Kenya's support in ousting the Al-Shabaab rebels.&lt;ref name="Kspmatep"&gt;Musau, Nzau.

==Joint communique==
On 31 October, a Somali delegation led by Prime Minister Ali met in [[Nairobi]] with Kenyan Premier [[Raila Odinga]] and other government officials to iron out differences and to outline a joint strategy on Operation Linda Nchi. After lengthy talks, the delegations issued a joint communique pledging co-ordinated military, political and diplomatic support for the mission, requesting that [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] (AMISOM) peacekeepers police areas captured from Al-Shabaab, and that the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) begin formal investigations against the group's commanders. The communique declared that "the Somalia government supports the activities of the Kenyan forces, which are being fully co-ordinated with the TFG of Somalia".&lt;ref name="Tssgskfm"&gt;[http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/agriculture/InsidePage.php?id=2000045933&amp;cid=4&amp; Somalia government supports Kenyan forces' mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314153558/http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/agriculture/InsidePage.php?id=2000045933&amp;cid=4&amp; |date=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyan Premier Odinga took the opportunity to dispel media reports alleging that the Kenyan government supported plans to form an autonomous Jubaland region in southern Somalia. He said that the Somali and Kenyan governments would support the establishment of local administrations in liberated areas according to domestic consensus. In addition, Somali Prime Minister Ali urged the international community to support the joint operation, and stated that the mission "would be led by Somali forces with support of Kenyan forces". The two delegations also formed a joint "high-level co-ordinating committee" to maintain regular contacts between their respective governments.&lt;ref name="Tsksvtcas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=2000045955&amp;cid=4&amp;ttl=Kenya |title=Kenya, Somalia vow to clear Al Shabaab |work=The Standard  |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intergovernmental Authority on Development==
On 17 November, Somalia's President Sharif Ahmed met in Nairobi with Kenyan President [[Mwai Kibaki]] and Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] (who had Ugandan troops in Somalia as part of [[AMISOM]]).&lt;ref name="Shkfts"&gt;[http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2011/11/somalis-helping-kenyan-forces-tackle-shabaab/ Somalis helping Kenyan forces tackle Shabaab]. Capital Radio.co.ke (19 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 November, [[Voice of America]] reported that an alliance of countries in East Africa were planning a broader joint military campaign to quash Al-Shabaab. An [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD) meeting slated for 25 November would reportedly urge all member nations, including Ethiopia, to contribute troops to the operation. Ethiopian officials indicated that no decision had officially been reached with regard to joining the troop contributing nations. However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Dina Mufti stated that "You can simply guess Ethiopia is going to be part and parcel of this process[...] The decision is not made as to sending the army, but per the IGAD council's resolutions of the past months, all IGAD member countries, the [[African Union]] and others also will be summoned, will be called, will be expected to somehow contribute something to strengthening the operations in Somalia."&lt;ref name="Emjaasas"&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Ethiopia-May-Join-Alliance-Against-Somalias-Al-Shabab-134124988.html Ethiopia May Join Alliance Against Somalia's Al-Shabab] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120114146/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Ethiopia-May-Join-Alliance-Against-Somalias-Al-Shabab-134124988.html |date=20 November 2011 }}.

==End of operation==
In March 2012, Colonel Cyrus Oguna, head of the KDF's Information and Operations sector, indicated that Operation Linda Nchi was about to end, as Kenyan troops were set to re-hat under the African Union's general command.&lt;ref name="Olneaautovr"&gt;{{cite news|title=Operation Linda Nchi ends as African Union takes over|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/national/national/67433-operation-linda-nchi-ends-as-african-union-takes-over|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=The Star|date=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2012, the BBC reported that Kenyan soldiers, acting as AMISOM's southern contingent, assisted Somali government forces in capturing [[Afmadow]] from Al-Shabaab, a southern town considered important in the military campaign owing to its network of roads that grant access to many different parts of the country.&lt;ref name="Bsfckastoa"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia forces capture key al-Shabab town of Afmadow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18288639|accessdate=8 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyan forces were officially integrated into AMISOM in early June.&lt;ref name="Gkdmaaaism"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenya: Defense Minister appointed as acting Internal Security Minister|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Kenya_Defense_Minister_appointed_as_acting_Internal_Security_Minister.shtml|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=Garowe Online|date=19 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130165830/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Kenya_Defense_Minister_appointed_as_acting_Internal_Security_Minister.shtml|archivedate=30 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Shabaab===
The Al-Shaabaab Islamist group is the main target of the operation.&lt;ref name="Aljazeera"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/20111017171543493140.html |title=Al-Shabaab threatens to attack Kenya  |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Shabaab officially denied involvement in any of the kidnappings.&lt;ref name="Ftskiis"/&gt; Sheikh [[Ali Mohamud Rage]], a spokesman for the group, said that its fighters would attack Kenya unless the Kenyan troops are withdrawn. He also claimed that bombardment by Kenyan aircraft had caused damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. According to [[Al Jazeera]], Al-Shabaab have attempted to capitalise on the incursion by depicting itself as a resistance force fighting foreign occupiers and urged local residents to take up arms against the Kenyan soldiers.&lt;ref name="Aljazeera"/&gt; According to the Kenyan government, the organisation is supported by [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref name="Apkrceasr"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g3YuDFnpD99uHrXuGn1VHXix669g?docId=952e21d9fb0a4ea9b10ca1ad4ecfaa5a Kenya raises concerns Eritrea arming Somali rebels]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somalia===
On 18 October, President of Somalia Sharif Ahmed and other TFG officials hosted a Kenyan delegation in Mogadishu&lt;ref name="Srkasatfas"/&gt; where Somalia's Defence Minister Hussein Arab Isse and Kenya's Minister of Defence Mohamed Yusuf Haji agreed to collaborate against Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="Spsoaki"/&gt; On 24 October, Ahmed again stated that although he welcomed Kenyan logistical support, he was against the Kenyan military presence,&lt;ref name="Ftskiis"/&gt; contradicting the agreement made on the 18th.&lt;ref name="Spoka"/&gt; He and the Somali Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali issued a joint statement on 27 October denying any agreement between the TFG and Kenyan government to allow the Kenyan incursion into Somalia,&lt;ref name="StarKe"/&gt; a stance criticised by other TFG officials.&lt;ref name="Ftskiis"/&gt; A joint communique issued on 31 October by the Prime Ministers of Somalia and Kenya on behalf of their respective governments noted "the current operations are being led by the TFG of Somalia Forces with the support of the Kenyan Defence Forces".&lt;ref name="Jointc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Communique – Operation Linda Nchi|url=http://kenyahighcomtz.org/?action=event-read-more.html&amp;id=1|publisher=Kenya High Commission, Tanzania|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
According to the [[Associated Press]], Kenya had not "actively engaged" in the [[War in Somalia (2009–)|conflict in southern Somalia]] prior to this operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Kenya to pursue militants into Somalia to protect border after spate of European kidnappings | agency=Associated Press | date=15 October 2011 | accessdate=16 October 2011 | author1=Straziuso, Jason | author2=Mwihia, Joe | url=http://www.medicinehatnews.com/world-news/kenya-to-pursue-militants-into-somalia-to-protect-border-after-spate-of-european-kidnappings-20111015.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119183240/http://www.medicinehatnews.com/world-news/kenya-to-pursue-militants-into-somalia-to-protect-border-after-spate-of-european-kidnappings-20111015.html# | archive-date=19 January 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a correspondent with ''[[The Independent]]'', Kenya had previously been supporting at least two militias in southern Somalia in a proxy war against Al-Shabaab, but moved instead to a direct presence of Kenyan troops once that strategy had failed.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/kenya-sends-in-troops-to-somalia-in-pursuit-of-alshabaab-militants-2371620.html | title=Kenya sends in troops to Somalia in pursuit of al-Shabaab militants |work=The Independent  | date=17 October 2011 | accessdate=25 October 2011 |last=Howden |first=Daniel | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya's military is regarded as inexperienced and reporters voiced doubts that it has the capacity to conduct the required logistical operations.&lt;ref name="aj19"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/2011101942627768243.html |title=Kenya says making gains against al-Shabab |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=19 October 2011 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint communique issued on 31 October by the Kenyan and Somali governments stated that the Kenyan forces were fully co-operating with Somali forces in a TFG led operation.&lt;ref name="Jointc"/&gt;

An African Union initiative called for the Kenyan soldiers to eventually be brought under AMISOM's command.&lt;ref name="Emjaasas"/&gt; On 12 November, the Kenyan government released a statement announcing that it had approved the re-hatting of its Kenya Defence Forces under AMISOM. Analysts expect the additional AU troop reinforcements to help the Somali authorities gradually expand their territorial control.&lt;ref name="Katjam"&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2011-12/07/content_14225808.htm Kenya agrees to join AMISOM]. ''China Daily''. (7 December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the International Crisis Group reported that the Kenyan Defence Forces "divulges little about which and how many forces
are involved, though prior to January, it appears to have been less than 2,000", or two battalions.&lt;ref name=ICG/&gt; According to the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], the two battalions, which crossed into Somalia on 16 October 2011, numbered 2,400 troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csis.org/publication/kenyas-intervention-somalia|title=Kenya's Intervention in Somalia|first=David W.|last=Throup|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2015, academics David Anderson and Jacob McKnight stated that at the operation's peak "more than 6,000 security personnel were deployed, including the [[Kenya Police]] and its [[General Service Unit]], the [[Administration Police]] (another paramilitary unit), and units from the Kenya Air Force".&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

===Ethiopia===
Ethiopia's involvement in the Kenyan operation was formally raised in November, following an IGAD initiative calling for all member nations to contribute troops to the effort against Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="Emjaasas"/&gt;

Media subsequently reported eye witness accounts of Ethiopian troops setting up positions in border areas of southern Somalia. This marks Ethiopia's first large scale intervention in the Somali Civil War since January 2009, when it withdrew troops after an [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|inconclusive effort]] to support the TFG by defeating the [[Islamic Courts Union]].&lt;ref name="ethiopian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/somaliaNews/idAFL5E7MJ0NE20111119|agency=Reuters|title=Ethiopian troops move into Somalia – witnesses|date=19 November 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Etcisw"&gt;[http://www.africasia.com/services/news_africa/article.php?ID=CNG.22591b8acc958d42dd13da26f35d6b7f.891 Ethiopian troops cross into Somalia: witnesses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111010/http://www.africasia.com/services/news_africa/article.php?ID=CNG.22591b8acc958d42dd13da26f35d6b7f.891 |date=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopian officials would not comment directly on the troop build-up in [[Guri'el]], where it had previously established a base during its 2006 intervention, but at least one suggested that Ethiopia could be expected to join the operation.&lt;ref name="ethiopian"/&gt;

After a multinational IGAD conference held on 25 November in Addis Ababa, IGAD announced that the Ethiopian government had agreed to support the allied forces' campaign against Al-Shabaab. Ethiopia's exact role in the operation, however, was not specified.&lt;ref name="Eatbsaois"&gt;Davison, William. (1 December 2011) [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-25/ethiopia-agrees-to-back-somalia-army-operations-igad-says.html Ethiopia Agrees to Back Somalia Army Operations, IGAD Says]. ''Bloomberg BusinessWeek''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian government also admitted that its soldiers had entered Somalia for reconnaissance duties, and indicated that, while its current activities were limited to liaison work and reconnoitring, its troop deployment would be brief.&lt;ref name="Repmmts"&gt;Maasho, Aaron.

===United States===
According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the [[US Air Force]] has been sharing surveillance data with the Kenyan military that it gathered via unarmed [[MQ-9 Reaper]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) flying out of [[Arba Minch]] in southern Ethiopia. The UAVs have been used for monitoring military activities in southern Somalia, and also can be armed with missiles and laser-guided bombs.&lt;ref name="Kspmatep"/&gt;

===Eritrea===
The United Nations has consistently accused Eritrea of aiding Al-Shabaab. In early November 2011, media reports also claimed that the Eritrean government had sent two plane-loads of arms to Al-Shabaab insurgents in southern Somalia. Eritrea's Foreign Minister issued a press release dismissing the charges as "pure fabrication and outright lies", and suggested that the reports were part of a "disinformation campaign" with the intended effect of discrediting Eritrea.&lt;ref name="Vedrisatas"&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/east/Eritrea-Denies-Reports-it-Sent-Arms-to-Al-Shabab-133076528.html Eritrea Denies Reports it Sent Arms to Al-Shabab]. Voice of America.com (1 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November, Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula met with the Eritrean ambassador to Kenya to seek clarification on intelligence allegations that weapons were being flown to Al-Shabaab from Eritrea.&lt;ref name="Apkrceasr"/&gt; Wetangula later told the press on 11 November that Kenya would consider "reviewing diplomatic ties" with Eritrea if the Eritrean government did not provide a satisfactory account of the situation.&lt;ref name="Ksunaaeebefdr"&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/1267924/-/item/1/-/130msit/-/index.html Kenya seeks UN audience as Eritrean envoy blames Ethiopia for diplomatic row]. Nation.co.ke.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November, Eritrea's envoy to Nairobi [[Beyene Russom]] told the press that his government had no objections vis-a-vis Operation Linda Nchi. He blamed the allegations that Eritrea was supplying weapons to Al-Shabaab on lack of due diligence on the part of the media. Russom also accused Ethiopia, stating that "We have nothing against Kenya. This piling up of accusations is the work, as we believe, of Ethiopia to camouflage its illegal military occupation of Eritrean territory. What is being said now about the planeload of weapons to Al-Shabaab again we believe is a creation of Ethiopia." With regard to Wetangula's warning that the Kenyan government would sever ties, Russom indicated that [[Asmara]] believed the Kenyan authorities were acting on false information. Eritrea's Foreign Minister [[Osman Saleh Mohammed]] is scheduled to arrive in Nairobi for talks on the issue.&lt;ref name="Ksunaaeebefdr"/&gt;

On 5 December, the [[United Nations Security Council]] imposed tougher sanctions on Eritrea due to its reported role in providing support to the Al-Shabaab militants. Observers and members of the allied forces subsequently expressed optimism that the long-standing civil conflict in southern Somalia would soon be resolved. Colonel Felix Kulayigye, a spokesman for AMISOM's Ugandan military contingent, indicated that "Normally, sanctions are supposed to reduce the capability of the affected country in its financial muscle. And, therefore, if Eritrea faces sanctions, if they are comprehensive enough, that means it will have not a spare penny to spend on negative elements". Political analyst Sheikh Abdisamad, the chairman of the research organisation Southlink, also suggested that "If the sanctions become effective on Eritrea, what I'm sure is that they can easily defeat those militia within Somalia" since sanctions would disrupt flights funnelling supplies to Al-Shabaab along the "Eritrean route" between Asmara in Eritrea and Kismayo in southern Somalia. Girma Asmerom, Eritrea's Ambassador to the AU, responded that the sanctions on his country would have a negative effect on both Eritrea's development and that of the larger East Africa region. He also indicated that he would not wish such restrictions on other nations, describing the United Nations' sanctions as "illegal and unjust".&lt;ref name="Vaheswesc"&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Analysts-Hope-Eritrea-Sanctions-Will-End-Somali-Conflict-135110938.html Analysts Hope Eritrea Sanctions Will End Somali Conflict]. Voice of America.com (5 December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pundits have suggested that Eritrea's involvement in the Somali conflict, its reported support of Al-Shabaab and earlier alleged backing of the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU), are part of a "proxy war" against Ethiopia. According to Emmanuel Kisiangani, a senior researcher with the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies, "Eritrea has had differences with Ethiopia over the Badme border region, which the Court of Arbitration at The Hague awarded to Eritrea, a decision which Ethiopia has not respected[...] It all boils down to the two actors supporting different parties. It is only that Ethiopia has played its cards well and what it does is acceptable to the international community." Eritrean ambassador Girma indicated that the Eritrean authorities "have never thought to destabilize any of the countries because they are our potential markets, they are our assets, we want a strong, viable Ethiopia". He also dismissed the charges that Eritrea is offering assistance to Al-Shabaab as "lies and deceptions", adding that Eritrea has not supported the group and would never do so.&lt;ref name="Vaheswesc"/&gt;

On 21 October, the regional IGAD met in Addis Ababa and agreed unanimously to support the co-ordinated military operation in southern Somalia. [[Ethiopia]]n Deputy Prime Minister [[Haile Mariam Desalegne]] also indicated that his country may join the military campaign, as "the long-term goal is to eradicate al Shabaab from Somalia and this is the proper time and the process shows al-Shabaab is coming to an end".&lt;ref name="Eanbkois"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/East-African-Nations-Back-Kenyan-Offensive-in-Somalia-132374053.html|publisher=Voice of America|title=E.

On 17 October, media reported that Somali TFG forces had taken control of the town of Qoqani. Kenyan air support reportedly assisted in the battle, with attack helicopters bombarding Al-Shabaab positions. Some reports also suggested involvement by the United States military, though Somali and Kenyan officials alluded only to Kenyan participation in the clash.

According to Somali military officials, air-strikes bombed targets in the southern town of Kismayo, an Al-Shabaab stronghold.&lt;ref name="Lignes"/&gt; Although the origin of the assault jet could not be determined,&lt;ref name="aj24"/&gt; French media have speculated that it could belong to the French military.&lt;ref name="Lignes"/&gt; Al-Shabaab said that the attack has caused no casualties.&lt;ref name="aj24"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/10/201110245515244178.html |title=Fighter jet targets southern Somali port |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October, four civilians were killed when their car was attacked by unidentified assailants near the Kenyan-Somali border in [[Mandera]]. It is, however, unclear whether Al-Shabaab was behind the attack.&lt;ref name="aj27"/&gt;

On 28 October, a Kenyan military convoy was ambushed by Al-Shabaab militants between the towns of Tabda and Bilis Qoqani in southern Somalia. Assisting Somali federal troops, the convoy was positioned {{convert|60|km|mi}} from the border, on the Kismayo route, According to the BBC, the ambush represents the Kenyan troops' first confrontation with Al-Shabaab insurgents and reportedly lasted 30&amp;nbsp;minutes. A spokesman for the Kenyan military told the press that the attack left nine Al-Shabaab fighters dead and two Kenyan soldiers injured. Abdul Asis Abu Muscab, a spokesman for the group, also indicated that the ambush represented the beginning of the fighting and that further attacks would ensue.&lt;ref name="bbc28" /&gt;

On 30 October, [[Kenyan Air Force]] fighter jets bombed the town of [[Jilib]], killing 10 and injuring at least 45. Some of these were reported to be civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Kenyan-Jets-Bomb-Southern-Somalia-10-Dead-132884553.html |title=Kenyan Jets Bomb Southern Somalia, 10 Dead |publisher=Voice of America |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya admitted conducting an air raid but blames Al-Shabaab for the death of the civilians. Kenya's Premier Raila Odinga said that civilian deaths were regrettable and any incidents would result in an investigation. However, he blamed Al-Shabaab for causing the civilian casualties by stating that an Al-Shabaab [[Technical (vehicle)|technical]] equipped with a machine gun, which was targeted during the air raid, drove into a civilian compound while burning and exploded, leading to civilian casualties.&lt;ref name="aj1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/11/2011111182352183356.html |title=Kenya issues attack warning over Twitter  |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October, TFG troops killed at least ten Al-Shabaab insurgents during clashes in Busar and Modaale, villages near the town of [[Elwak]]. TFG forces were reported to be nearing the port of [[Burgabo]], 140 kilometres south of Kismayo.&lt;ref name="Kspmatep"/&gt; On 1 November the Kenyan military announced that it would attack ten Somali towns including Kismayo.&lt;ref name="aj1" /&gt; By 2 November Al-Shabaab began conscripting residents to help defend the entrenched Kismayo, while at sea a skiff carrying fuel was sunk by the Kenyan navy killing 18 militants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Al+Shabaab+militants+fall+back+to+defend+Kismayu+/-/1056/1266940/-/omsq6nz/-/ Al-Shabaab militants fall back to defend Kismayu – News]. nation.co.ke (2 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November, Kenyan military spokesman Emmanuel Chirchir warned Kenyan and Somali merchants via Twitter not to sell donkeys to Al-Shabaab, as the group has now "resorted to using donkeys to transport their weapons." He also cautioned the public that any "large concentration and movement of loaded donkeys will be considered an al-Shabab activity."&lt;ref name="Ktwdnsdta"&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Kenya-Tweets-Warning-Do-Not-Sell-Donkeys-to-al-Shabab-133183483.html Kenya Tweets Warning: Do Not Sell Donkeys to al-Shabab].

On 10 November, Al-Shabaab fighters ambushed a Kenyan convoy in between the towns of Tabda and Bills Qoqani. The fighting which started in the afternoon continued overnight and according to Al-Shabaab they managed to kill 30 Kenyan troops and destroy six Kenyan military trucks. The TFG, however, claimed only 21 soldiers had been killed and that only three trucks were destroyed, while four were captured by Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="ambush"&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail/209527.html Al-Shabaab ambush kills 30 Kenyan troops], 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya's military spokesman Major Emmanuel Chirchir was, however, quick to deny the claims, and stated that Al-Shabaab had resorted to a propaganda campaign and categorically stated that the reports carried on Iranian press TV to be unsubstantiated and completely false. "Attention of the Ministry of State for Defence has been drawn to the influx of propaganda and false information in regards to the on-going operation in Somalia. The continued false reporting by Press TV and other like minded media is unacceptable and should not be taken as factual information and events," said Major Chirchir.&lt;ref name="propaganda"&gt;[http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/archives/entertainment/InsidePage.php?id=2000046352&amp;cid=4&amp;.html Kenya's military might] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105071650/http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/archives/entertainment/InsidePage.php?id=2000046352&amp;cid=4&amp;.html |date=5 January 2012 }}, 7 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November, TFG and Kenyan forces attacked an Al-Shabaab base in Busar. An Al-Shabaab official alleged that his group had killed 8 and captured 3 allied soldiers during the battle. Kenyan military officials denied the claim, saying that the joint forces had killed 12 militants but incurred no casualties. Later that day, Al-Shabaab attacked [[Raskamboni movement]] positions in the town of Kulbio near Dobley.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;Leftie, Peter. (17 November 2011) [http://allafrica.com/stories/201111180120.html Nation's Army in New Battles As Advance Resumes]. Allafrica.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November, Kenyan Colonel Cyrus Oguna told the press that information and intelligence volunteered by local residents in southern Somalia had greatly assisted Kenyan forces. He cited captured Al-Shabaab positions as a testimony to this fact, and suggested that more areas would be secured courtesy of this information. The volunteered intelligence had also reportedly helped the soldiers successfully manage a change in tactics by the Al-Shabaab militants, the latter of whom had reportedly resorted to disguising themselves as women to escape the joint Somali and Kenyan troops.&lt;ref name="Shkfts"/&gt;

On 20 November, Kenyan forces assisted by warships reportedly destroyed an Al-Shabaab and Al-Qaeda training facility in [[Hola Wajeer]], situated in [[Lower Juba]]'s [[Badhadhe District]]. A military convoy of Somali and Kenyan troops was also ambushed in between the towns of [[Tabto]] and [[Dobley]]. According to a TFG official, the allied forces' casualties totalled one dead and several wounded TFG soldiers as well as a burned TFG vehicle, while 10 Al-Shabaab militants were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Mayoyo, Patrick.

On 21 November, Kenyan military spokesman Major Emmanuel Chirchir warned that the militants planned to release a video clip showing allegedly captured Kenyan soldiers being executed. He said this was part of the propaganda campaign against the operation. He said the relationship of the Kenyan and Somali military with the local people in the areas where Al-Shabaab have been flushed out continues to thrive. "Based on this, we received concrete information of an arms trade and Al-Shabaab infiltration which were countered successfully," he said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Kenya+and+Amisom+plan+joint+onslaught++/-/1056/1277658/-/item/0/-/op3euaz/-/index.html Kenya and Amisom plan joint onslaught]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2011, the TFG retook control of [[Beledweyne]] from the Al-Shabaab militants. Somali National Army (SNA) soldiers and around 3,000 allied Ethiopian army troops attacked the city in the early morning, capturing it after hours of fighting. Around 20 people were killed in the battle, mainly consisting of Ethiopian soldiers and Al-Shabaab insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16372453 |title=Ethiopian troops capture Beledweyne from Somalia militants |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 60 Al-Shabaab fighters were killed due to airstrikes by the Kenyan military on 7 January 2012, according to officials in Kenya, with a further 50 or so injured.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

On 28 September 2012, Kenyan AMISOM forces, assisted by forces from the Somali National Army and the Ras Kamboni militia, launched an [[Battle of Kismayo (2012)|amphibious offensive on Kismayo]].&lt;ref name="Apkfalrsoaqlmis"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenyan forces attack last remaining stronghold of al-Qaeda-linked militants in Somalia|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kenyan-forces-attack-last-remaining-stronghold-of-al-qaida-linked-militants-in-somalia/2012/09/28/c6905994-0937-11e2-9eea-333857f6a7bd_story.html|archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20120929052204/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kenyan-forces-attack-last-remaining-stronghold-of-al-qaida-linked-militants-in-somalia/2012/09/28/c6905994-0937-11e2-9eea-333857f6a7bd_story.html|archive-date=29 September 2012|accessdate=28 September 2012|agency=Associated Press|date=28 September 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gktlbaoscok"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chonghaile|first=Clar Ni|title=Kenyan troops launch beach assault on Somali city of Kismayo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/kenyan-soldiers-capture-kismayo-somalia|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 September 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Shabaab forces withdrew from the city the next day, with the AMISOM forces later moving in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19769058 |title=Somalia Islamists abandon Kismayo amid AU attack |publisher=BBC News |date=29 September 2012 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the [[Westgate shopping mall shooting]] in [[Nairobi]] was reportedly in retaliation for the Kenyan troop presence in Somalia and followed Al-Shabaab warnings that it would attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24186780|publisher=BBC News|title=Nairobi Westgate shoot-out 'kills 20' in Kenya|date=21 September 2013|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Panteleimon Oleksandrovych Kulish''' (also spelled ''Panteleymon'' or ''Pantelejmon Kuliš'', {{lang-uk|Пантелеймон Куліш}}, August 7, 1819 – February 14, 1897) was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[writer]], [[critic]], [[poet]], [[folklorist]], and [[translator]].

==Overview==
Panteleimon Kulish, born 7 August 1819 in [[Voronizh]] (now in [[Sumy Oblast]]), d 14 February 1897 in [[Borzna|Motronivka]], [[Chernigov Governorate]]. Prominent writer, historian, ethnographer, and translator. He was born into an impoverished [[Cossack-gentry]] family. After completing only five years at the [[Novhorod-Siverskyi]] [[Education in Russia|gymnasium]] he enrolled at [[Kiev University]] in 1837 but was not allowed to finish his studies because he was not a noble. He obtained a teaching position in [[Lutsk]] in 1840. There he wrote his first historical novel in [[Russian language|Russian]] ''Mykhailo Charnyshenko, or Little Russia Eighty Years Ago'' (2 vols, 1843). [[Mykhailo Maksymovych]] promoted Kulish's literary efforts and published several of his early stories. His first longer work written in Ukrainian was the epic poem ''Ukraina'' (1843). In 1843–5 Kulish taught in [[Kiev]] and studied Ukrainian history and ethnography. There he befriended [[Taras Shevchenko]], Mykola Kostomarov, and [[Vasyl Bilozersky]]; their circle later became the nucleus of the secret [[Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius]]. Panteleimon Kulish was the first person known to translate the whole of the [[Bible]] into the [[modern Ukrainian language]] and was also the first to write historical novels in Ukrainian. His most famous contribution in this field was the novel ''Chorna Rada'' (The Black Council) which was set in [[Cossack]] times. Kulish was also active in historical writing, composing a brief history of Ukraine in verse (under the title ''Ukraina'') and a much larger ''History of the Reunification of Rus'' in three volumes. The latter dealt with the era of Hetman [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] in the seventeenth century. His two-volume collection of Ukrainian folklore, ''Notes on Southern Rus'' retains its scholarly significance to the present day.

==Life==
During his early years at the [[University of Kiev]], Kulish came under the influence of the historian and literary figure [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych]] who turned his attention to his native Ukrainian culture. In the 1840s, he became close to the poet [[Taras Shevchenko]], and the historian [[Mykola Kostomarov]] and participated in the illegal [[Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius]] which envisioned a Ukrainian national rebirth, including national independence, within a free and equal Slavic federation.

In 1847, Kulish was arrested for his participation in this organization, and spent some time in prison and a few years in exile.

In the late 1850s, he was reunited with Kostomarov and others of the Cyril-Methodian "Brethren" and participated in the Ukrainian journal ''Osnova'' (The Foundation). At this time, he published his famous ''Notes on Southern Rus''' in which he pioneered a new [[Ukrainian orthography]] for the Ukrainian vernacular, the ''Kulishivka'' alphabet, based on phonetics rather than etymology.  This later became the basis of the modern written Ukrainian language.

In the 1860s and 1870s, he gradually turned more conservative and began to criticize Shevchenko, the Cossack revolts, and the ideal of the Cossacks as the defenders of popular liberty. Eventually, despite Tsarist repression of Ukrainian culture and the ban on the appearance of the Ukrainian language in print, he developed a theory that Ukraine and Russia should be politically united but divergent in culture, an approach which won few adherents among the Ukrainian intelligentsia of the time. Nevertheless, this conservative approach to Ukrainian affairs was never completely exinguished and was later resurrected in a different form by other Ukrainian political thinkers such as [[Vyacheslav Lypynsky]], Stepan Tomashivsky, and others.

In the 1880s, Kulish visited Austrian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and, in light of the ban on Ukrainian publications in the Russian Empire, cooperated with the Ukrainian cultural and political leaders there. Thus he was one of the first Ukrainian figures to, at least in part,  successfully bridge the gap between Russian and Austrian Ukraine.

He spent his last years isolated on his homestead in eastern Ukraine. During these years he translated a great deal of west European literature, including Shakespeare, into Ukrainian.

In [[genealogy]], '''pedigree collapse''' describes how reproduction between two individuals who share an ancestor causes the number of distinct ancestors in the family tree of their [[offspring]] to be smaller than it could otherwise be. [[Robert C. Gunderson]] coined the term; synonyms include '''implex''' and the German '''''Ahnenschwund''''' (loosely translated: “loss of lineage”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gundacker|first=Felix|title=Genealogical Dictionary|url=http://www.felixgundacker.at/Files/fgGenealogicalDictionary.pdf|year=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220040/http://www.felixgundacker.at/Files/fgGenealogicalDictionary.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
Without pedigree collapse, a person's ancestor tree is a [[binary tree]], formed by the person, the parents (2), the grandparents (4), great-grandparents (8), and so on. However, the number of individuals in such a tree [[exponential growth|grows exponentially]] and will eventually become impossibly high. For example, a single individual alive today would, over 30 generations going back to the [[High Middle Ages]], have &lt;math&gt;2^{30}&lt;/math&gt; or roughly a billion ancestors, more than the total [[world population]] at the time.&lt;ref name="River_Out_of_Eden"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=All Africa and her progenies | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | title = River Out of Eden | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-465-06990-3 | title-link = River Out of Eden }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed|date=October 2017}}

This paradox is explained by shared ancestors, referred to as pedigree collapse. Instead of consisting of all different individuals, a tree may have multiple places occupied by a single individual. This typically happens when the parents of an ancestor are related to each other (sometimes unbeknownst to themselves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John E. |last=Pattison |year=2001 |title=A New Method of Estimating Inbreeding in Large Semi-isolated Populations with Application to Historic Britain |journal=HOMO: Journal of Comparative Human Biology |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=117–134 |doi=10.1078/0018-442X-00024 |pmid=11802564 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018442X04700128 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John E. |last=Pattison |date=July–August 2007 |title=Estimating Inbreeding in Large Semi-isolated Populations: Effects of Varying Generation Length and of Migration |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=495–510 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.20610 |pmid=17546611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the offspring of two first cousins has at most only six great-grandparents instead of the normal eight. This reduction in the number of ancestors is pedigree collapse. It collapses the ancestor tree into a [[directed acyclic graph]].

In some cultures, cousins and other relations were permitted, encouraged, or required to marry. This may have been to keep kin bonds, wealth and property within a family ([[endogamy]]) or simply because there was a limited number of potential marriage partners available. Among [[Royal family|royalty]], the frequent requirement to only marry other royals resulted in a reduced [[gene pool]] in which most individuals were the result of extensive pedigree collapse. [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], for example, had only four great-grandparents instead of the usual eight. Furthermore, two of these great-grandparents, [[Charles IV of Spain]] and [[Maria Luisa of Parma]], who were first cousins, were parents of another twice great-grandmother, [[Maria Isabella of Spain]]. [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] was also the brother of another twice great-grandparent, [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]]; they were both sons of [[Charles III of Spain]] and [[Maria Amalia of Saxony]].

More generally, in many cultures intermarriage may frequently occur within a small village, limiting the available gene pool.

==Ancestry==
{{One source section|date=October 2017}}
The [[House of Habsburg]] gives a well-documented example of pedigree collapse. In the case of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], the last Habsburg King of Spain, there were three uncle-niece marriages among the seven unions of his immediate ancestry (i.e. parents, grandparents and great-grandparents). His father and two of his great-grandfathers married their nieces. His paternal grandparents were [[Cousin#First_cousins_once_removed|first cousins once removed]], but they comprised two of the seven marriages because they were also parents to his maternal grandmother. His maternal grandparents' marriage and the final marriage of great-grandparents was between first cousins.
{{Ancestors of Charles II of Spain|width=75%}}

The maximum pedigree collapse of 50% within a single generation is caused by procreation between full siblings; such children have only two different grandparents instead of the usual four. If two half-siblings procreate, their children have three grandparents instead of four (25%).

If a child and parent were to procreate, their offspring would have four grandparents; so, procreation between parents and children would result in less pedigree collapse than procreation between full siblings – although one of the grandparents would also be a parent and therefore introduce no additional genes.

If a person procreates with a full sibling of one of their parents (as with the uncle-niece marriages mentioned above), the offspring have four different persons as grandparents, and eight great-grandparents, but again some of these contribute no additional genes (see [[inbreeding]]).

Small, isolated populations such as those of remote islands represent extreme examples of pedigree collapse, but the common historical tendency to marry those within walking distance, due to the relative immobility of the population before modern transport, meant that most marriage partners were at least distantly related. Even in America around the 19th century, the tendency of immigrants to marry among their ethnic, language or cultural group produced many cousin marriages.

If one considers as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of time {{var|t}} the number of a given individual's ancestors who were alive at time {{var|t}}, it is likely that for most individuals this function has a maximum at around 1200 AD. Some [[geneticist]]s{{Which|date=October 2017}} believe that everyone on Earth is at most [[Cousin#Basic definitions|50th cousin]] to everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=George M. |last2=Adams |first2=Cecil |date=21 August 1987 |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_083b.html |website=The Straight Dope |title=2,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;8,&amp;nbsp;16,&amp;nbsp;... how can you always have MORE ancestors as you go back in time? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''social forum''' is an open meeting place for [[civil society|civil society organizations]] and individuals opposed to [[neoliberalism]] and what its participants regard as the domination of the world by [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2|title=Charter of Principles|publisher=Fórum Social Mundial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2ZvbQY?url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2|archivedate=2010-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first social forum was the [[World Social Forum]] (WSF) held in January 2001 in [[Porto Alegre]]. It was designed as a counter forum to the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) held in [[Davos]] at the same time. While the WSF regards the WEF as a meeting of the political and economic elite of the world, the WSF gathers social forces and aims to promotes [[democratization]] and [[social justice]].

After the first WSF, the social forum idea was replicated across the world in various transnational, national, and local social forums. Most, though not all, social forums adhere to the WSF Charter of Principles,&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; drawn up by the International Council of the WSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2|title=Who organizes it|publisher=Fórum Social Mundial|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006125543/http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2|archivedate=2010-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of participants in the social forums has reflected the diversity of the [[Global Justice Movement]] (or [[Anti-Globalization Movement]]).

== History ==
Located on rocky and elevated terrain, this important border town served well as a stronghold from the year 907&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Briz Martínez|first=Juan|title=Historia de la fundación y antigüedades de San Juan de la Peña|year=1620|location=Saragossa|page=chapter 9, folio 312}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was [[Reconquista|reclaimed]] by [[Sancho I of Pamplona]].

It was incorporated in 1044 by [[Ramiro I of Aragon|Ramiro I]] into the [[Kingdom of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="rabal" /&gt;

In the year 1452, during the [[War of Navarre]], Queen [[Juana Enríquez|Juana Enríquez de Córdoba]] moved to the town, then called "Sos". There she gave birth to the [[infante]] Ferdinand on March 10, 1452, who later became [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], one of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. His birth added "d'o Rei Catolico" to the name of the town,&lt;ref name="rabal"&gt;{{cite web | author = Alberto, Rosa and Javier | title = Sos del Rey Católico | url = http://www.hernandezrabal.com/espana/aragon/zaragoza/sosreycatolico.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates as either "''You are of the Catholic Monarch''" or "''You belong to the Catholic Monarch''".

'''St. John's''' is the capital and largest city of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. It is on the eastern tip of the [[Avalon Peninsula]] on the large Canadian island, [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Melvin Baker |url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/st-johns/ |title=St. John's |work=The Encyclopedia of Music in Canada|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city spans {{convert|446.04|km2|sqmi}} and is North America's easternmost city.&lt;ref name="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/06/29/cape-spear050629.html?email |title=Cape Spear's 'most easterly' sign to stay in place |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=29 June 2005 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/cabot1497.html|title=John Cabot's Voyage of 1497|work=Newfoundland and Labrador heritage Web Site Project|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|date=November 2010|accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kiosk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnskiosk.com/history.php|title=History of St. John's|publisher=St. John's Kiosk|accessdate=2011-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103005802/http://www.stjohnskiosk.com/history.php|archivedate=3 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldest city"&gt;[[Paul O'Neill (author)|Paul O'Neill]], ''The Oldest City: The Story of St. John's, Newfoundland'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-9730271-2-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name has been attributed to the Nativity of [[John the Baptist]], when [[John Cabot]] was believed to have sailed into the harbour in 1497 and to a Basque fishing town with the same name. Existing on maps as early as 1519, it is the oldest city in North America. It was officially incorporated as a city in 1888. With a metropolitan population of approximately 219,207 (as of July 1, 2017), the [[St. John's Metropolitan Area]] is Canada's [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|20th largest metropolitan area]] and the second largest [[Census geographic units of Canada|Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA) in [[Atlantic Canada]], after [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]].&lt;ref name="2017 population estimates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/180213/t001a-eng.htm|title=Table 1: Annual population estimates by census metropolitan area, July 1, 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population of census metropolitan areas|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo05a-eng.htm|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a rich history, having played a role in the [[French and Indian War]], the [[American Revolutionary War]], and the [[War of 1812]]. Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] received the first transatlantic wireless signal in St. John's.&lt;ref name="Belrose"&gt;{{cite web|last=Belrose|first=John S.|title=Fessenden and Marconi: Their Differing Technologies and Transatlantic Experiments During the First Decade of this Century|url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/radio/radio_differences.html|publisher=IEEE Canada|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its history and culture have made it into an important tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/photos-top-10-oceanfront-cities/#/oceanfront-stjohns-canada_86312_600x450.jpg |title=Photos: Top 10 Oceanfront Cities - National Geographic |publisher=Travel.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of St. John's history}}

===Early history (1500–1799)===
St. John's is one of North America's oldest European settlements, with fishermen setting up seasonal camps in the early 16th century.&lt;ref name="oldest city"/&gt; [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] declares in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b84389437/f1.item |title=Océan Atlantique nord. Reproduction grandeur de l'original d'une partie de la mappemonde de 1544 / par Sébastien Cabot |publisher=Sebastian Cabot |year=1544}}&lt;/ref&gt; that St. John's earned its name when he and his father, the Venetian explorer [[John Cabot]] became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, in the morning of 24 June 1494 (against British and French historians stating 1497),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=84-7782-265-4 |title=Cartografía Marítima Hispana}}&lt;/ref&gt; the feast day of Saint [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; However, the locations of Cabot's landfalls are disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/J002678F/john_cabot.htm |title=Oracle ThinkQuest – John Cabot |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513200219/http://library.thinkquest.org/J002678F/john_cabot.htm |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/cabot1497.html |title=John Cabot's Voyage of 1497 |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of expeditions to St. John's by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540 French, [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula. In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], it is a common belief the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of [[Pasaia]] in the Basque Country, where one of the fishing towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in [[Basque language|Basque]], Donibane).&lt;ref name="kiosk"/&gt;

The earliest record of the location appears as ''São João'' on a Portuguese map by [[Pedro Reinel]] in 1519. When [[John Rut]] visited St. John's in 1527, he found [[Normans|Norman]], [[Brittany|Breton]] and Portuguese ships in the harbour. On 3 August 1527, Rut wrote a letter to King Henry on the findings of his voyage to North America; this was the first known letter sent from North America. St. Jehan is shown on Nicolas Desliens' world map of 1541, and San Joham is found in João Freire's Atlas of 1546.&lt;ref name="The Early Settlement of St. John's"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/stjohns.html |title=The Early Settlement of St. John's |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August 1583, an English [[Sea Dogs|Sea Dog]], Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]] claimed the area as England's first overseas colony under [[Royal Charter]] of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Gilbert, Sir Humphrey |first=David B. |last=Quinn |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gilbert_humphrey_1E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no permanent population, however, and Gilbert was lost at sea during his return voyage, thereby ending any immediate plans for settlement.&lt;ref name="kiosk"/&gt; The [[Newfoundland National War Memorial]] is on the waterfront in St. John's, at the purported site of Gilbert's landing and proclamation.

By 1620, the fishermen of England's [[West Country]] controlled most of Newfoundland's east coast.&lt;ref name="Brief History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/newfoundland.htm|title=Newfoundland: Brief History|author=Stephen Luscombe|work=The British Empire|accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1627, William Payne, called St. John's "the principal prime and chief lot in all the whole country."

Sometime after 1630, the town of St. John's was established as a permanent community.&lt;ref name="Higgins"&gt;{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Jenny|title=Migratory Fishery and Settlement Patterns|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/settlement_patterns.html|work=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage|publisher=N&amp;L Heritage Website|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this they were expressly forbidden by the English government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast.

The population grew slowly in the 17th century: St. John's was Newfoundland's largest settlement when English naval officers began to take censuses around 1675.&lt;ref name="The Early Settlement of St. John's"/&gt; The population grew in the summers with the arrival of migratory fishermen.&lt;ref name="kiosk"/&gt; In 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South [[Devon]]) set up fishing rooms at St. John's, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats.&lt;ref name="The Early Settlement of St. John's"/&gt;

The town's first significant defenses were likely erected due to commercial interests, following the temporary seizure of St. John's by the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] in June 1665.

The inhabitants fended off a second Dutch attack in 1673, when it was defended by Christopher Martin, an English merchant captain. Martin landed six cannons from his vessel, the ''Elias Andrews'', and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near Chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour. With only 23 men, the valiant Martin beat off an attack by three Dutch warships. The English government planned to expand these fortifications ([[Fort William, Newfoundland|Fort William]]) in around 1689, but construction didn't begin until after the French admiral [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] captured and destroyed the town in the [[Avalon Peninsula Campaign]] (1696). When 1500 English reinforcements arrived in late 1697, they found rubble where the town and fortifications had stood.

The French attacked St. John's again in 1705 ([[Siege of St. John's]]), and captured it in 1708 ([[Battle of St. John's]]), devastating civilian structures with fire on each instance.&lt;ref name="The Early Settlement of St. John's"/&gt;

====The oldest European settlement in North America controversy====
There has been some controversy regarding which European settlement is the oldest in North America. As mentioned above, while English fishermen had set up seasonal camps in St. John's in the 16th century, they were expressly forbidden by the English government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English-controlled coast. As a result, the town of St. John's was not established as a 'permanent' community until after the 1630s.&lt;ref name="Higgins"/&gt; With respect to the oldest surviving permanent [[Colonial empire of the Kingdom of England|English settlements]] in North America, it was preceded by [[Jamestown, Virginia]] (1607),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamestown, A Place of Many Beginnings|url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/index.htm|publisher=US National Park Service website}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cuper's Cove]] colony at [[Cupids, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cupids]] (1610), [[St. George's, Bermuda]] (1612)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications, Bermuda|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/983|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Subdivision 1I, Newfoundland and Labrador#Bristol's Hope|Bristol's Hope]] colony at [[Harbour Grace]] (1618).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2223|title=The 400th Anniversary of Cupids, NL&amp;nbsp;– the Oldest English Colony in Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=2011-03-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513200226/http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2223|archivedate=13 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history (1800–present)===
The [[United Irish Uprising in Newfoundland|United Irish Uprising]] began with rumours in April 1800 that as many as 400 men took a secret oath of the [[Society of United Irishmen]] and rebelled against the [[British Army]].&lt;ref name="UIU"&gt;[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/united-irish-uprising.php The United Irish Uprising in Newfoundland, 1800]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century saw major changes in Newfoundland: population growth, beginnings of government, establishment of churches, reinforcement of commercial ties with North America and development of the seal, salmon and [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]] fisheries. St. John's population grew slowly. Although it was primarily a fishing station, it was also a [[garrison]], a centre of government and a commercial hub. St. John's served as a naval base during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name="The Early Settlement of St. John's"/&gt;
[[File:Saint John the Baptist Cathedral 1892.jpg|thumb|St. John's shortly after the [[Great Fire of 1892]]. The fire destroyed a significant portion of the city.]]
The core of the city was destroyed by fire several times, the most famous of which was the [[Great Fire of 1892]].&lt;ref name="City of Fire"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Butler|title=St. John's: City of Fire|date=22 August 2007|publisher=Flanker Press|ISBN=1-897317-11-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guglielmo Marconi]] received the first transatlantic wireless signal in St. John's on 12 December 1901 from his wireless station in [[Poldhu]], Cornwall.&lt;ref name="Belrose"/&gt; St. John's was the starting point for the first non-stop transatlantic aircraft flight, by [[Alcock and Brown]] in a modified [[Vickers Vimy]] IV bomber, in June 1919, departing from Lester's Field in St. John's and ending in a bog near [[Clifden]], [[Connemara]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviation-history.com/airmen/alcock.htm|title=Alcock and Brown|publisher=Aviation History Online Museum|accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, the flight was duplicated by American aviator and adventurer [[Steve Fossett]] in a replica Vickers Vimy aircraft, with [[St. John's International Airport]] substituting for Lester's Field (now an urban and residential part of the city).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4645853.stm|title=Historic flight lands in Ireland|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-04-17 |date=3 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of the Atlantic|Second World War]], the harbour supported [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ships that were engaged in [[anti-submarine warfare]]. It was the site of an [[United States Army Air Forces|American Army Air Force]] base, [[Pepperrell Air Force Base|Fort Pepperrell]], that was established as part of the "[[Lend-Lease]]" [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]] between the United Kingdom and United States.&lt;ref name="kiosk"/&gt; The base included several US-manned [[Harbor Defenses of Argentia and St. John's|coast defence guns]], and a Canadian-manned battery of two Lend-Lease [[10-inch gun M1888|10-inch M1888 guns]] was at Fort [[Cape Spear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Berhow | first1 = Mark A., Ed. | last2 = | first2 = | title = American Seacoast Defenses, A Reference Guide, Third Edition | location = McLean, Virginia | publisher = CDSG Press | year = 2015 | page = 225 | isbn = 978-0-9748167-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsg.org/defenses-in-newfoundland-canada/ US coast defences in Newfoundland at the Coast Defense Study Group website]&lt;/ref&gt; The base was transferred to Canadian control in 1960 and is now known as [[CFS St. John's]].

St. John's, and the province as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s by the [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|collapse]] of the northern [[Cod fisheries|cod fishery]], which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higgins|first=Jenny|title=Economic Impacts of the Cod Moratorium|year=2008|publisher=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Web Site|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/moratorium_impacts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the [[Hibernia oil field|Hibernia]], [[Terra Nova oil field|Terra Nova]] and [[White Rose oil field|White Rose]] [[oil fields]] led to an [[economic boom]] that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for about half of the province's [[economic output]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~oilpower/documents/NL%20oil%207-25-1.pdf |title=Offshore Oil: An Overview of Development in Newfoundland and Labrador|work=Oil, Power and Dependency|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|author=Leah Fusco|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2006/08/17/trade-midyear.html |title=CBC News: Some thorns in rosy outlook: St. John's trade board (Released August 08, 2006) |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=17 August 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:StJohns Newfoundland ViewfromSignalHill.jpg|thumb|Located on the northeast coast of the Avalon Peninsula, St. John's is North America's most easterly city.]]

The city is the largest in the province and the second largest in the Atlantic Provinces after [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=201&amp;S=3&amp;O=D&amp;RPP=150 |title=Population and dwelling counts, for census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations, 2006 and 2001 censuses|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[downtown St. John's|downtown]] area lies to the west and north of St. John's Harbour, and the rest of the city expands from the downtown to the north, south, east and west.

Coniferous trees such as [[black spruce]], [[white spruce]], and [[balsam fir]] dominate the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is [[white birch]]; species of lesser stature include [[alder]], [[cherry]] and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, [[sycamore maple]] is most abundant and [[Norway maple]] is common. [[Blue spruce]], [[Aesculus hippocastanum|common horsechestnut]], [[European beech]] and [[Tilia cordata|littleleaf linden]] are among the other non-native species grown.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Fry, Krista Ryall, Peggy Dixon and Dan Quiring (2008).

===Climate===
[[File:The Battery, St. John's Nfld. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Fog settling over [[The Battery, St. John's|The Battery]], a neighbourhood in St. John's, the [[fog]]giest city in Canada.]]
St. John's has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with lower seasonal variation than normal for the latitude, which is due to [[Gulf Stream]] moderation.

Despite this maritime moderation, average January maximum temperatures are slightly lower in St. John's than in [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]], an inland city that is near the more marine air of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], demonstrating the cold nature of Eastern Canada. Mean temperatures range from {{convert|-4.9|C|1}} in February to {{convert|16.1|C|1}} in August, showing somewhat of a seasonal lag in the climate. The city is also one of the areas of the country most prone to tropical cyclone activity, as it is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, where tropical storms (and sometimes hurricanes) travel from the United States. The city is one of the rainiest in Canada outside of coastal British Columbia. This is partly due to its propensity for tropical storm activity as well as moist, Atlantic air frequently blowing ashore and creating precipitation.

Of major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest (124 days),&lt;ref name="Foggiest location"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=37&amp;submit=Submit|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219193253/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=37&amp;submit=Submit|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-19|title=National Climate Data and Information Archive|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; windiest ({{convert|24.3|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} average speed),&lt;ref name="Windiest location year-round"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=60&amp;submit=Submit|title=National Climate Data and Information Archive|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2013-01-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121216045102/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=60&amp;submit=Submit|archivedate=16 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cloudiest (1,497&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine).&lt;ref name="Cloudiest skies year-round"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=58&amp;submit=Submit|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219192052/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=58&amp;submit=Submit|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-19|title=National Climate Data and Information Archive|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is unusual for humid continental climates, which typically have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds.

In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can turn into heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation. Snow cover in St. John's is variable, and especially early in the winter season, may be slow to develop, but can extend well into the spring months (March, April). The St. John's area is subject to freezing rain events (called "silver thaws"), the worst of which paralyzed the city in April 1984 and April 2017.

{{Main|Architecture of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador}} {{See also|Neighbourhoods in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|List of tallest buildings in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador}}

[[File:Waterside, St Johns.jpg|thumb|Coastline of the Waterside neighbourhood. Some residences, storage shacks, and wharves are primarily made of wood.]]
[[File:St John's Houses.jpg|thumb|left|Houses in St. John's are typically painted in bright colours.]]

St. John's architecture has a distinct style from the rest of Canada, and its major buildings are remnants of its history as one of the first British colonial capitals. Buildings took a variety of styles according to the means available to build them.

Starting as a fishing outpost for European fishermen, St. John's consisted mostly of the homes of fishermen, sheds, storage shacks, and wharves constructed out of wood. Like many other cities of the time, as the Industrial Revolution took hold and new methods and materials for construction were introduced, the landscape changed as the city grew. [[The Great Fire of 1892]] destroyed most of the [[downtown St. John's|downtown]] core, and most residential and other wood-frame buildings date from this period.&lt;ref name="City of Fire"/&gt;

Often compared to San Francisco due to the hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/nytimes/articles/2006/07/28/st_johns_newfoundland/ |work=The Boston Globe |title=St. Johns, Newfoundland |date=28 July 2006 |first1=Jeff |last1=Schlegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[St. John's City Council|city council]] has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=PHB Group Inc.|url=http://www.stjohns.ca/cityservices/planning/pdfs/Heritagefinal.pdf|title=St. John's Heritage Areas, Heritage Buildings and Public View|accessdate=5 August 2011|publisher=City of St. John's|date=21 March 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016204712/http://www.stjohns.ca/cityservices/planning/pdfs/Heritagefinal.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations have caused much controversy over the years. With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that do not meet the current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/01/21/nl-councillors-fortis-121.html |title=Wait and see on Fortis proposal: St. John's councillors |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/01/20/nl-fortis-critics-120.html?ref=rss&amp;loomia_si=t0:a16:g2:r1:c0.152619:b29896682 |title=Critics slam St. John's high-rise proposal |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/02/05/nl-woolworth-building-205.html |title=Proposal to replace St. John's eyesore gets praise |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2009/02/12/harbour-hotel.html |title=Planned harbour front hotel too tall, public meeting told |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=12 February 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet the need for more office space downtown without compromising the city's heritage, the city council amended heritage regulations, which originally restricted height to 15 metres in the area of land on Water Street between Bishop's Cove and Steer's Cove, to create the "Commercial Central Retail – West Zone". The new zone will allow for buildings of greater height. A 47-metre, 12-storey office building, which includes retail space and a parking garage, was the first building to be approved in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohns.ca/pdfs/1832-01%20LUAR%20FINAL_351%20Water%20St.%202010%20May%2028.pdf |author=PHB Group, Inc. |title=Land Use Assessment Report: Proposed Office and Parking Building – 351 Water Street |format=PDF |date=May 2010 |page=16 |accessdate=2011-01-02 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predominantly Christian, the population of St. John's was once divided along sectarian ([[Catholic]]/[[Protestant]]) lines. In recent years, this sectarianism has declined significantly, and is no longer a commonly acknowledged facet of life in St. John's. St. John's is the seat of the [[Basilica of St. John The Baptist|Roman Catholic Archbishop of St. John's]], and the Anglican [[Cathedral of St. John the Baptist (St. John's)|Bishop of Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador]]. All major Christian sects showed a decline from 2001–2011 with a large increase in those with no religion from 3.9% to 11.1%.

St. John's economy is connected to both its role as the provincial capital of Newfoundland and Labrador and to the ocean. The civil service which is supported by the federal, provincial and municipal governments has been the key to the expansion of the city's labour force and to the stability of its economy, which supports a sizable retail, service and business sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/govt58a-eng.htm?sdi=st%20john%20employment |title=Statistics Canada – Federal government employment, wages and salaries, by census metropolitan area |publisher=0.statcan.gc.ca |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005230634/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/govt58a-eng.htm?sdi=st%20john%20employment |archive-date=5 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial government is the largest employer in the city, followed by [[Memorial University of Newfoundland|Memorial University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Melvin |title=St. John's |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/st-johns/ |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohns.ca/cityhall/pdfs/StatisticalProfileJul2010.pdf |title=Statistical Profile St. John's Metro Area |format=PDF |date=June 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hockey===
St. John's has been home to several professional [[ice hockey|hockey]] franchises. The [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] were an [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) team from 1991 to 2005. The team left after the 2004–05 season to [[Toronto]] due to the desire of its parent team, the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], to reduce travel costs and to have a tenant for its [[Ricoh Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/08/09/babyleafs040809.html |work=CBC News |title=Baby Leafs to leave St. John's after 14 seasons |date=10 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, the Maple Leafs were replaced by the [[St. John's Fog Devils]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL). The team left St. John's in 2008 after just three seasons due to a poor lease arrangement with the city over the use of [[Mile One Centre]] and poor attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2008/01/23/fog-devils.html |work=CBC News |title=Fog Devils sold, move planned to Quebec |date=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/08/09/nl-stjohns-hockey-.html |work=CBC News |title=Puck may drop at St. John's Mile One |date=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both franchises were relocated to be closer to their parent team.

In 2018, the [[ECHL]] approved an expansion team for St. John's with the [[Newfoundland Growlers]] to begin play in the fall of 2018. The team is expected to become the ECHL affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs bringing the Leafs back to St. Johns for the first time since 2005.

==Local media==
{{Main|Media in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador}}
St. John's has one daily newspaper, ''[[The Telegram]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CA |url=http://www.thetelegram.com/ |title=The Telegram |publisher=The Telegram |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other local papers include ''[[The Muse (student paper)|The Muse]]'', ''[[The Gazette (Newfoundland)|The Gazette]]'', ''[[Le Gaboteur]]'', ''[[The Scope (alternative weekly)|The Scope]]'', ''The Business Post'' and ''The Current''.

[[CJON-DT]], known on air as "NTV", is an [[independent station]]. The station sublicenses entertainment programming from [[Global Television Network|Global]] and news programming from [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and Global, rather than purchasing primary broadcast rights. [[Rogers Cable]] has its provincial headquarters in St. John's, and their community channel [[Rogers TV]] airs local shows such as ''Out of the Fog'' and ''One Chef One Critic''. [[CBC Television|CBC]] has its Newfoundland and Labrador headquarters in the city and their television station [[CBNT-DT]] broadcasts from University Avenue.

The city is home to 15&amp;nbsp;AM and FM radio stations, two of which are [[French-language]] stations. St. John's is the only Canadian city served by radio stations whose call letters do not all begin with the letter ''C''. The [[ITU prefix]] ''VO'' was assigned to the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] before the province joined [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1949, and three [[AM radio|AM]] stations kept their existing call letters. However, other commercial radio stations in St. John's that went to air after 1949 use the same range of prefixes (''CF''–''CK'') currently in use elsewhere in Canada, with the exception of [[VOCM-FM]], which was permitted to adopt the VOCM callsign because of its corporate association with the AM station that already bore that callsign. VO remains in use in [[amateur radio]].

''allNewfoundlandLabrador'' is the city's daily [[online newspaper]], which focuses on business news from across the province.&lt;ref name=brad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=James|title=Subscription news site AllNovaScotia expands to Newfoundland|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/subscription-news-site-allnovascotia-expands-to-newfoundland/article28830527/|website=Globe and Mail|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suren M. Ayvazyan''' (4 August 1933 &amp;ndash; 11 September 2009)&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;[http://aivazyansuren.am/ Biography of Suren Ayvazyan] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[geologist]] and public figure. He is the author of several works on [[linguistics]] and the history of [[Armenia]].

==Works on the history of Armenia==
In 1960 Ayvazyan met Russian archaeologist [[Boris Piotrovsky]], who participated in the excavations of the ancient [[Urartu|Urartian]] city of [[Teishebaini]]. Ayvazyan discussed with Piotrovsky whether the mythological ancient Armenia described by [[Movses Khorenatsi]] was real. Boris Piotrovsky said to him, "As a geologist, you know that no natural process leaves no evidence. If, as you argue, Movses Khorenatsi's oldest Armenia is there, please show me an archaeological site in Armenia that confirms it."&lt;ref name="Айвазян2000"&gt;''Айвазян С. М.'' История России. Армянский след, «Крон-Пресс», Москва, 2000 {{ISBN|5-232-01223-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayvazyan chose as example an ancient monument of the Bronze Age, [[Metsamor site|Metsamor]], and published a work to demonstrate its relationship with Armenia,&lt;ref name="Айвазян1964"&gt;''Айвазян С. М.'' Известия Академии Наук Армянской ССР, серия Науки о Земле, XVII, 6, Ереван, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;where he made a false description of coins with alleged [[Hayasa]]n characters. He ascribed them to the 19th century BC and provided his own 'translation'. After checking in the Department of [[Numismatics]] of the Historical Museum of Armenia in 1968, he found that these coins were issued by the [[Atabeg]] dynasty of Azerbaijan in the period 1133-1225).&lt;ref name="Пиотровский1971"&gt;''[[Boris Piotrovsky]]'' Письмо в редакцию // Историко-филологический журнал, Ереван, № 3, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same article, Ayvazyan described the ''Hayasian inscription'' found on the rocks of Metsamor, which, after inspection conducted in 1968 by Professor V. Krachkovsky, was thought to be symbols of the [[Thuluth]] [[Arabic alphabet]] of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Пиотровский1971"/&gt; This falsification, however, found its way into some renowned scientific journals, including the Czechoslovak ''New Orient'' (B. Mkrtchian, "The Mystery of Metsamor," No. 3, VI, 1967) and Anatolian Studies(Volume XVIII, 1968), as well as into popular publications of Armenia: the newspaper Komsomolets (November 15, 1968) and the magazine Garun (No. 1, 1969). In these publications Ayvazyan argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|Finally, we found, together with a group of geologists Hayasian archaeological site Metsamor with its development Mining Metallurgy production and hieroglyphic writing system did not leave any doubt about the localization Hayasa within Ararat region of Armenia. Evidence of that is the Metsamor Hayasian (ie ancient), rather than any other monument of culture, are found here in the first Armenian hieroglyphic writing. Their decoding of the authors on the basis of correlation with the Armenian hieroglyphic marks, preserved in several medieval manuscripts of Matenadaran. It ceased to exist centenary misunderstanding - the concept of the state of [[Urartu]].
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Ayvazyan created a theory of the Armenian origins of Urartu, with the support of the abovementioned "evidence" of material culture and the discredited attempt at translating the Urartian cuneiform inscriptions into Armenian.{{clarify|date=January 2012}} As a matter of fact, [[Boris Piotrovsky]] noted that, by carrying out this work, Ayvazyan was unaware that he was replicating work done by A. Mordtmann in the 19th century, who tried to read the Urartian cuneiform inscriptions in Armenian.&lt;ref name="Мордтман"&gt;''Mordtmann A.D.'' Über die Keilinschriften von Armenien // Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, Leipzig, XXXI, 1877&lt;/ref&gt; "a work that has been rejected by science long time ago."&lt;ref name="Пиотровский1971"/&gt;

Despite the disclosure of the falsification, Suren Ayvazyan continued publishing the results of his 'studies' in the popular press, and in books, both in Armenian and in Russian, from the 1980s to the late 2000s.

==Works on the History of Russia==
Ayvazyan published a series of surprising assertions regarding the history of Russia. In particular, he argued that the birthplace of the Proto-Russian was the Armenian Highlands in the 11th millennium BC. He also argued that Armenian Smbat Bargatuni founded [[Kiev]], that the Christian churches of Kiev and Novgorod were built by Armenian architects in the 10th to the 11th centuries, that the Armenians introduced Christianity to Russia, and that the real name of [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] was Gevorg Bagratuni.

These opinions, according to Ayvazyan, are related to the fact that Mount Small Ararat is formed like a female breast. The other name for this mountain ''Sys'', in Russian, is short for the female breast.{{clarify|date=January 2012}} It is also related to the alleged (but not documented in the scientific literature) detection in the Armenian highlands of 'Slavic skulls', dated by Ayvazyan as the second millennium BC. However, a large part of his claims are based only on many linguistic parallels and archaeological research.&lt;ref name="Айвазян2000"/&gt;

==Socio-political activities==
In the years of the Soviet perestroika, Ayvazian was active in the [[Popular Front for Armenia]], and signed a number of letters to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], then the head of the Soviet state, about the transfer of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region to [[Armenia]].
In 2001 he wrote a letter to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|British Queen Elizabeth II]] to demand the return of Armenian treasures, consisting of the treasures of Cilicia, which according to some information [[Leo V, King of Armenia|Levon VI]] left in the possession of the [[Edward III of England|English King Edward III]] (1327–1377).&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/culture/2001/05/10/4992.html Новость сайта Pravda.ru от 10 мая 2001 года]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=264720 Газета «КоммерсантЪ» № 81 (2211) от 15.05.2001.

==Plot==
[[Josef Mengele]] is in exile in Argentina in 1960, living under a new identity. He makes a long journey by road to a new location by following a family, as the roads are dangerous.  Mengele has his own place to stay in [[Patagonia]], but he takes an interest in Lilith, the daughter of the family, and he moves into their hotel by paying six months' rent.

Lilith was born prematurely and, as a result, she is much shorter than her classmates.  She is bullied at school because of her size. Mengele is working as a doctor and suggests that he can help her grow more quickly, and Lilith's mother Eva agrees to this. Meanwhile, people who have been searching for Mengele believe that they have found him and begin to gather evidence on his true identity.

Eva is pregnant with twins, to Mengele's fascination. He compiles copious notes on them, Lilith, and the rest of her family as he continues to aid in her growth. Lilith becomes sick as a side effect of the growth hormones that Mengele has given her. Her father Enzo finds out the truth; he is furious and demands that Mengele leave the hotel.  Eva goes into labour, and Mengele is the only doctor nearby and is allowed to help with the care of the newborn twins. They are born prematurely, and Mengele starts experiments to ensure their survival.  He is conscious of the fact that people are trying to find his true identity, and when he's almost caught, he escapes the remote location on a seaplane.

{{Campaignbox War of Attrition}}

The '''War of Attrition''' ({{lang-ar|حرب الاستنزاف}} ''Ḥarb al-Istinzāf'', {{lang-he|מלחמת ההתשה}} ''Milhemet haHatashah'') involved fighting between [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[PLO]] and their allies from 1967 to 1970.

Following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], no serious diplomatic efforts tried to resolve the issues at the heart of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. In September 1967, the Arab states formulated the "[[Khartoum Resolution|three nos]]" policy, barring peace, recognition or negotiations with Israel. Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] believed that only military initiative would compel Israel or the [[international community]] to facilitate a full Israeli withdrawal from [[Sinai]],&lt;ref name="dunstan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Egypt Will Fight, Nasser Shouts|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=November 24, 1967|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19671124&amp;id=iy4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mmwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7156,4781952|page=2 |postscript = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hostilities soon resumed along the [[Suez Canal]].

These initially took the form of limited artillery duels and small-scale incursions into Sinai, but by 1969 the [[Egyptian Army]] judged itself prepared for larger-scale operations. On March 8, 1969, Nasser proclaimed the official launch of the War of Attrition, characterized by large-scale shelling along the Suez Canal, extensive aerial warfare and [[commando]] raids.&lt;ref name="dunstan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirages"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aloni|first=Shlomo|title=Israeli Mirage and Nesher Aces|publisher=Osprey|year=2004|pages=46–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hostilities continued until August 1970 and ended with a ceasefire, the frontiers remaining the same as when the war began, with no real commitment to serious peace negotiations.

==Egyptian front==
[[Israel]]'s victory in the [[Six-Day War]] left the entirety of the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] up to the eastern bank of the Suez Canal under Israeli control.  Egypt was determined to regain Sinai, and also sought to mitigate the severity of its defeat. Sporadic clashes were taking place along the cease-fire line, and Egyptian missile boats sank the Israeli destroyer [[HMS Zealous (R39)|INS ''Eilat'']] on October 21 of the same year.

Egypt began shelling Israeli positions along the [[Bar Lev Line]], using heavy artillery, [[Mikoyan|MiG]] aircraft and various other forms of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] assistance with the hope of forcing the [[Israeli government]] into concessions.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel responded with aerial bombardments, airborne raids on Egyptian military positions, and aerial strikes against strategic facilities in Egypt.

The international community and both countries attempted to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict.  The [[Jarring Mission]] of the United Nations was supposed to ensure that the terms of [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]] would be observed, but by late 1970 it was clear that this mission had been a failure.  Fearing the escalation of the conflict into an "[[Warsaw Pact|East]] vs. [[NATO|West]]" confrontation during the tensions of the mid-[[Cold War]], the American president, [[Richard Nixon]], sent his Secretary of State, [[William P. Rogers|William Rogers]], to formulate the [[Rogers Plan]] in view of obtaining a ceasefire.

In August 1970, Israel, [[Jordan]], and Egypt agreed to an "in place" ceasefire under the terms proposed by the Rogers Plan.  The plan contained restrictions on missile deployment by both sides, and required the cessation of raids as a precondition for peace.  The Egyptians and their Soviet allies rekindled the conflict by violating the agreement shortly thereafter, moving their missiles near to the Suez Canal, and constructing the largest anti-aircraft system yet implemented at that point in history.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name="JewishVirtualLibrary"&gt;{{cite web

The Israelis responded with a policy which their Prime Minister, [[Golda Meir]], dubbed "[[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetrical response]]", wherein Israeli retaliation was disproportionately large in comparison to any Egyptian attacks.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

Following Nasser's death in September 1970, his successor, [[Anwar Al-Sadat]], continued the ceasefire with Israel, focusing on rebuilding the [[Egyptian army]] and planning a full-scale attack on the Israeli forces controlling the eastern bank of the Suez Canal. These plans would materialize three years later in the [[Yom Kippur War]]. Ultimately, Israel would return Sinai to Egypt after the two nations signed a [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]].

Various military historians have commented on the war with differing opinions. [[Chaim Herzog]] notes that Israel withstood the battle and adapted itself to a "hitherto alien type of warfare."&lt;ref&gt;Herzog (1982), 220&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ze'ev Schiff]] notes that though Israel suffered losses, she was still able to preserve her military accomplishments of 1967 and that despite increased Soviet involvement, Israel had stood firm.&lt;ref&gt;Schiff, Ze'ev, ''History of the Israeli Army'', Straight Arrow Books (1974), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Dunstan notes that, although Israel continued to hold the Bar Lev Line, the war's conclusion "led to a dangerous complacency within the Israeli High Command about the resolve of the Egyptian armed forces and the strength of the Bar-Lev Line."&lt;ref name="dunstan"/&gt; On the tactical level, [[Kenneth Pollack]] notes that Egypt's commandos performed "adequately" though they rarely ventured into risky operations on a par with the daring of Israel's commandos,{{sfn|Pollack|2002|page=95}} Egypt's artillery corps encountered difficulty in penetrating the Bar-Lev forts and eventually adopted a policy of trying to catch Israeli troops in the exterior parts of the forts.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|page=94}}

The Egyptian Air Force and Air Defense Forces performed poorly.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|page=95}} Egyptian pilots were rigid, slow to react and unwilling to improvise.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|page=96}} According to U.S. intelligence estimates, Egypt lost 109 aircraft, most in air-to-air combat, while only 16 Israeli aircraft were lost, most to anti-aircraft artillery or [[Surface-to-air missile|SAMs]].{{sfn|Pollack|2002|page=96}} It took a salvo of 6 to 10 [[SA-2 Guideline|SA-2]] Egyptian anti-aircraft missiles to obtain a better than fifty percent chance of a hit.{{sfn|Pollack|2002|page=96}}

'''December 26–27, 1969''': Israel launches Operation [[Operation Rooster 53|Rooster 53]], carried out by paratroopers transported by [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion|Sikorsky CH-53E]] and [[Super Frelon]] helicopters. The operation results in the capture of an Egyptian [[P-12 radar|P-12]] radar at [[Ras Gharib]] and carrying it to Israel by 2 [[CH-53 Sea Stallion]] Helicopters. The operation enabled Israeli and American learning of the latest [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] radar technology, and caused a huge morale impact on the Egyptians.

'''January 22, 1970''': President Nasser secretly flies to Moscow to discuss the situation. His request for new [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] batteries (including the [[3M9 Kub]] and [[Strela-2]]) is approved.  Their deployment requires qualified personnel along with squadrons of aircraft to protect them.  Thus, he needed [[Red Army]] personnel in large numbers, something the [[Kremlin]] did not want to provide. Nasser then threatens to resign, implying that Egypt might turn to the United States for help in the future. The Soviets had invested heavily in President Nasser's regime, and so, the Soviet leader, [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General-Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]], finally obliged. The Soviet presence was to increase from 2,500–4,000 in January to 10,600–12,150 (plus 100–150 Soviet pilots) by June 30.

'''January 22, 1970''': [[Operation Rhodes]]. Israeli paratroopers and naval commandos are transported by IAF [[Super Frelon]] helicopters to [[Shadwan|Shadwan Island]] where they kill 70 Egyptian soldiers and take 62 more prisoner at the loss of 3 dead and 7 wounded. The soldiers dismantle an Egyptian radar and other military equipment for transport back to Israel. IAF aircraft sink two Egyptian P-183 [[torpedo boat]]s during the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Herzog, ''The Arab-Israeli Wars'', Random House New York (1982) p.214 {{ISBN|0-394-50379-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''April 8, 1970''': The Israeli Air Force carries out bombing raids against targets identified as Egyptian military installations. A group of military bases about 30 kilometers from the Suez Canal is bombed. However, in what becomes known as the [[Bahr El-Baqar primary school bombing|Bahr el-Baqar incident]], Israeli [[F4 Phantom II]] fighter jets attack a single-floor school in the Egyptian town of Bahr el-Baqar, after it was mistaken for a military installation. The school is hit by five bombs and two air-to-ground missiles, killing 46 schoolchildren and injuring over 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= | title=The Innocent Dead | date=April 20, 1970 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944025,00.html | work =Time Magazine | accessdate =April 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;^ "The War of Attrition as Reflected in Egyptian Sources" (1995), p. 107, by Mustafa Kabha (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; This incident put a definite end to the campaign, and the Israelis instead then concentrate upon Canal-side installations. The respite gives the Egyptians time to reconstruct its SAM batteries closer to the canal.  Soviet flown MiG fighters provide the necessary air cover. Soviet pilots also begin approaching IAF aircraft during April 1970, but Israeli pilots have orders not to engage these aircraft, and break off whenever Soviet-piloted MiGs appear.

'''July 30, 1970''': A large-scale dogfight occurs between Israeli and Soviet aircraft, codenamed ''[[Operation Rimon 20|Rimon 20]]'', involving twelve to twenty-four Soviet MiG-21s (besides the initial twelve, other MiGs are "scrambled", but it is unclear if they reach the battle in time), and twelve Israeli [[Dassault Mirage III]]s and four [[F-4 Phantom II]] jets. The engagement takes place west of the Suez Canal. After luring their opponents into an ambush, the Israelis shoot down four of the Soviet-piloted MiGs. A fifth is possibly hit and later crashes en route back to base. Four Soviet pilots are killed, while the IAF suffers no losses except a damaged Mirage.&lt;ref name=ACIG/&gt; The Soviets respond by luring Israeli fighter jets into a counter-ambush, downing two,&lt;ref&gt;Sachar, Howard: ''Israel and Europe: An Appraisal in History'', p. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt; and deploying more aircraft to Egypt. Following the Soviets' direct intervention, known as "Operation Kavkaz",&lt;ref name=ACIG /&gt; Washington fears an escalation and redoubles efforts toward a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

'''Early August, 1970''': Despite their losses, the Soviets and Egyptians manage to press the air defenses closer to the canal, shooting down a number of Israeli aircraft. The SAM batteries allow the Egyptians to move in artillery which in turn threatens the Bar Lev Line.

'''August 7, 1970''': A cease-fire agreement is reached, forbidding either side from changing "the military status quo within zones extending 50&amp;nbsp;kilometers to the east and west of the cease-fire line."  Minutes after the cease-fire, Egypt begins moving SAM batteries into the zone even though the agreement explicitly forbids new military installations.&lt;ref name="dunstan"/&gt;  By October there are approximately one-hundred SAM sites in the zone.

'''September 28, 1970''': President Nasser dies of a heart attack, and is succeeded by Vice President [[Anwar Sadat]].

==Casualties==
According to the military historian [[Ze'ev Schiff]], some 921 Israelis, of which 694 were soldiers and the remainder civilians, were killed on all three fronts.&lt;ref name="Schiff 1974 p246"&gt;Schiff (1974) p246&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaim Herzog]] notes a slightly lower figure of just over 600 killed and some 2,000 wounded&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Herzog, ''The Arab-Israeli Wars'', Random House New York, (1982) p.220 {{ISBN|0-394-50379-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Netanel Lorch, states that 1,424 soldiers were killed in action between the period of June 15, 1967 and August 8, 1970. Between 24&lt;ref name="Morris 1999 p362"&gt;Morris (1999) p362&lt;/ref&gt; and 26&lt;ref name="London Sunday Times 1974 p42"&gt;Insight Team of the London ''Sunday Times'' (1974) p42&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli aircraft were shot down. A Soviet estimate notes aircraft losses of 40. One destroyer, the [[HMS Zealous (R39)|INS ''Eilat'']], was sunk.

As with the previous Arab–Israeli wars of [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948]], [[Suez Crisis|1956]] and [[Six-Day War|1967]], Arab losses far exceeded those of Israel, but precise figures are difficult to ascertain because official figures were never disclosed. The lowest estimate comes from the former Egyptian Army Chief of Staff, [[Saad el Shazly]], who notes Egyptian casualties of 2,882 killed and 6,285 wounded. Historian [[Benny Morris]] states that a more realistic figure is somewhere on the scale of 10,000 soldiers and civilians killed. [[Ze'ev Schiff]] notes that at the height of the war, the Egyptians were losing some 300 soldiers daily and aerial reconnaissance photos revealed at least 1,801 freshly dug graves near the Canal zone during this period. Among Egypt's war dead was the Egyptian Army Chief of Staff, [[Abdul Munim Riad]].&lt;ref name="Schiff 1974 p246"/&gt;

Between 98&lt;ref name="Morris 1999 p362"/&gt; and 114&lt;ref name="London Sunday Times 1974 p42"/&gt; Egyptian aircraft were shot down, though a Soviet estimate notes air losses of 60.

Several Egyptian naval vessels were sunk. The Palestinian PLO suffered 1,828 killed and 2,500 were captured.&lt;ref name="Schiff 1974 p246"/&gt; Jordan's intervention on behalf of the PLO during the [[Battle of Karameh]] cost it 40-84 killed and 108-250 injured. An estimated 58 Soviet military personnel were killed and four to five Soviet-piloted [[MiG-21]] aircraft were shot down in aerial combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sdIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yGADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4832,777296|title=Al Ahram Editor Relates Soviet Air Losses To Israelis|last=United Press International|date=August 12, 1972|work=St. Petersburg Times|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syrian casualties are unknown but an armored raid by Israeli forces against Syrian positions in June 1970 led to "hundreds of Syrian casualties."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; [[Cuba]]n forces, which were deployed on the Syrian front, were estimated to have lost 180 dead and 250 wounded.&lt;ref name=karsh/&gt;

The '''Women's War''', or '''Aba Women's Riots''', was an insurrection in [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria|British Nigeria]] that occurred in November 1929. The revolt broke out when thousands of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] women from the [[Bende, Abia|Bende District]], [[Umuahia]] and other places in eastern Nigeria traveled to the town of [[Oloko]] to protest against the [[Warrant Chief]]s, whom they accused of restricting the role of women in the government. The Aba Women's Riots of 1929, as it was named in British colonial records, is more aptly considered a strategically executed anti-colonial revolt organised by women to redress social, political and economic grievances. The protest encompassed women from six ethnic groups (Ibibio, Andoni, Orgoni, Bonny, Opobo, and Igbo) &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zukas|first1=Lorna Lueker|title=Women's War of 1929|url=http://www.revolutionprotestencyclopedia.com/fragr_image/media/IEO_Womens_War_of_1929|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was organised and led by the rural women of [[Owerri]] and [[Calabar]] provinces. During the events, many Warrant Chiefs were forced to resign and 16 [[Native Court]]s were attacked, most of which were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birrell Gray Commission, p. 43; Public Records Office, CO583/169/3, Sessional Paper No. 12|url=http://jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu/~plarson/syllabi/122/reading/igbo/igbo.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907025858/http://jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu/~plarson/syllabi/122/reading/igbo/igbo.htm|archivedate=7 September 2006|year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{failed verification|date=October 2012}}

== History of women organizing in Nigeria ==
There is a long history of collective action by women in Nigeria. In the 1910s, women in Agbaja stayed away from their homes for a month because they thought that men were killing pregnant women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Women's War of 1929: Gender and Violence in Colonial Nigeria|last=Matera|first=Marc|last2=Bastia|first2=Misty|last3=Kingsley Kent|first3=Susan|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-1137377777|location=Basingstoke, United Kingdom|pages=ix-x, 19–21, 45–46|quote=|via=myilibrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their collective absence pushed village elders to take action to address the concerns of the women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1924, 3000 women in [[Calabar]] protested a market toll that was required by the government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In Southwestern Nigeria, there were other women organizations such as the [[Lagos Market Women's Association]], [[Nigerian Women's Party]], and [[Abeokuta Women's Union]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Cheryl D|year=1981|title=Grassroots Organizing: Women in Anti-Colonial Activity in Southwestern Nigeria|url=http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~triner/global/Johnson.pdf|journal=African Studies Association|volume=25|pages=138–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an "elaborate system of women's market networks,"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=Susan Z|year=1990|title=Rewriting history, motherhood, and rebellion: Naming an African women's literary tradition|url=|journal=Research in African Literatures|volume=21.1|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the Igbo and Ibibio women used to communicate information to organize the Women's War.

== Events and causes ==

In actuality, the emergence of the Aba Women's War was long in the making. [[Colonial Nigeria|Colonialism]] altered the position of various Nigerian women in their societies. Women traditionally were allowed to participate in the government&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and held a major role in the market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Men and women also worked collaboratively in the domestic sphere, and were recognized to both have important individual roles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women also had the privilege of participating in political movements due to the fact that they were married to elites. The British saw these practices as "a manifestation of chaos and disorder",&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and so they attempted to create political institutions which commanded authority and monopolized force. While they considered the political institutions headed by Igbo men, the British ignored those of the women, effectively shutting them out from political power.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;"Sitting on a Man": Colonialism and the Lost Political Institutions of Igbo Women, Author: Judith van Allen, Source: Canadian Journal of African Studies / Revue Canadienne des Études Africaines, Vol. 6, No. 2, Special Issue: The Roles of African Women: Past, Present and Future (1972), pp. 165-181 Stable URL: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/484197&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The British believed that this patriarchal and masculine order would establish a moral order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The women were dissatisfied with the British colonizers because of increased school fees, corruption by local officers, and forced labor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The event that ultimately led to the war was direct taxation. In April 1927, the British colonial government in Nigeria took measures to enforce the Native Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance. A colonial resident, W. E. Hunt, was commissioned by the lieutenant governor of Nigeria to explain the provisions and objects of the new ordinance to the people throughout the five provinces in the Eastern Region. This was to prepare the ground for the introduction of direct taxation due to take effect in April 1928. Direct taxation on men was introduced in 1928 without major incidents, thanks to the careful propaganda during the preceding twelve months. In September 1929, Captain J. Cook, an assistant [[District Officer]], was sent to take over the Bende division temporarily from the serving district officer, a Mr. Weir, until the return of Captain Hill from leave in November. Upon taking over, Cook found the original nominal rolls for taxation purposes inadequate because they did not include details of the number of wives, children, and livestock in each household. He set about revising the nominal roll. This exercise brought the colonial authority into direct conflict with women in Eastern Nigeria and was the catalyst for fundamental change in the local administration.

The announcement of Cook's intention to revise the nominal roll was made to a few chiefs in Oloko Native Court and the counting began about October 14, 1929. The women of Oloko suspected that the enumeration exercise was a prelude to the extension of direct taxation, which had been imposed on the men the previous year. Women were already burdered with supporting their families and helping men pay their taxes.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Nigeria|last=Falola|first=Toyin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780511399909|location=|pages=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the women did not have political power within the patriarchal colonial system, they utilized collective action to communicate their dissatisfaction. On December 2, 1929, more than ten thousand women demonstrated at Oloko, Bende, against the enumeration of men, women, and livestock by the acting district officer. This event at Oloko was to spread to most parts of the Eastern Region within the next four weeks in the ''Ogu Umunwanyi'' or Women's War of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Chima J.

Andrew C. Okolie (Africa World Press, 2003), 623–46, 630.&lt;/ref&gt;

From November to December, women from [[Owerri]] to [[Calabar]] looted factories and destroyed Native Court buildings and properties along with the property of members of the Native Court.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Oloko ===
The Aba Women's War was sparked by a dispute between a woman named Nwanyeruwa and a man, Mark Emereuwa, who was helping to make a census of the people living in the town controlled by the Warrant, Okugo. Nwanyeruwa was of [[Ngwa]] ancestry, and had been married in the town of [[Oloko]]. In Oloko, the [[census]] was related to taxation, and women in the area were worried about who would tax them, especially during the period of hyperinflation in the late 1920s. The financial crash of 1929 impeded women's ability to trade and produce so they sought assurance from the colonial government that they would not to be required to pay taxes. Faced with a political halt, the women settled that they would not pay taxes nor have their property appraised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, Culture and development: A study of human capabilities|last=Glover|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=449|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of November 18, Emereuwa  arrived at Nwanyereuwa's house and approached Nwanyereuwa, since her husband Ojim, had already died. He told the widow to "count her goats, sheep and people." Since Nwanyereuwa understood this to mean, "How many of these things do you have so we can tax you based on them", she was angry. She replied by saying "Was your widowed mother counted?," meaning "that women don't pay tax in traditional Igbo society."{{ref|Aba}} The two exchanged angry words, and Emeruwa grabbed Nwanyeruwa by the throat.&lt;ref&gt;''The Testimony of Nwanyoji, March 14, 1930. In'' The Women's War of 1929 ''by Toyin Falola and Adam Paddock. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2011.''&lt;/ref&gt; Nwanyeruwa went to the town square to discuss the incident with other women who happened to be holding a meeting to discuss the issue of taxing women. Believing they would be taxed, based on Nwanyeruwa's account, the Oloko women invited other women (by sending leaves of palm-oil trees) from other areas in the Bende District, as well as from [[Umuahia]] and [[Ngwa]]. They gathered nearly 10,000 women who protested at the office of Warrant Chief Okugo, demanding his resignation and calling for a trial.{{ref|Oriji}}

=== The Oloko Trio ===
The leaders of the protest in Oloko are known as the Oloko Trio: Ikonnia, Nwannedia and Nwugo.  The three were known for their persuasion, intelligence and passion. When protests became tense, it was often these three who were able to deescalate the situation, preventing violence. However, after two women were killed while blocking colonial roads as a form of protest, the trio was not able to calm the situation there, the police and army were sent to the town.{{ref|Oriji}}

===The legacy of Nwanyeruwa===
Due to her contribution to the Women's War, Madame Nwanyeruwa is and still remains the name that comes up when bringing up the history of militancy of women in Nigeria, and has been said to be linked to the history of British colonialism.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The feminization of development processes in Africa: Current and future perspectives|last=James, Valentine Udoh|first=and James, Etim|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=101|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nwanyereuwa played a major role in keeping the protests non-violent. She was advanced in age compared to many who led the protests. Under her advice, the women protested in song and dance, "sitting" on the Warrant Chiefs until they surrendered their insignia of office and resigned. As the revolt spread, other groups followed this pattern, making the women's protest a peaceful one. Other groups came to Nwanyeruwa to get in writing the inspirational results of the protests, which, as Nwanyeruwa saw them, were that, "women will not pay tax till the world ends [and] Chiefs were not to exist any more."{{ref}} Women of Oloko and elsewhere brought money contributions to Madam Nwanyeruwa for helping them avoid paying taxes. Unfortunately, many women rioted and attacked Chiefs, destroying their homes causing the revolt to be marked as violent.&lt;ref name="James, Valentine Udoh 1999"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The feminization of development processes in Africa: Current and future perspectives|last=James, Valentine Udoh|first=and James, Etim|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Madam Mary Okezie ===
Madam Mary Okezie (1906–1999) was the first woman from her Igbo clan to gain a Western education, and was teaching at the Anglican Mission School in Umuocham Aba in 1929 when the women's revolt broke out. Although she did not participate in the revolt, she was very sympathetic to the women's cause. She was the only woman who submitted a memo of grievance to the Aba Commission of Inquiry (sent in 1930). Today, the major primary source for studying the revolt is the Report of the Aba Commission of Inquiry. After the revolt, Madam Okezie emerged as founder and leader of the [[Ngwa]] Women's Association and working for the rest of her life to support women's rights in Nigeria.{{ref|Oriji}}

== Means of protest/protest strategies ==
{{main|Sitting on a man}}
A major tactic in the [[protest]]s was what is known as "sitting". Scholars like Glover have noted that men who did not value women, risked the possibility of being shunned and sat on by those who felt normalcy had to be restored within their society.&lt;ref name="Glover 1995"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, culture, and development: A study of human capabilities.|last=Glover|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} "[[Sitting on a man]]" or "making war on a man" was a long held tradition used as the women's main weapon when faced with injustices in their society. Scholars like Green (1964), Judith Van Allen (1976), and Monday Effiong Noah (1985) have noted that some methods used by Aba women were :surrounding the home of the man in question, insulting his manhood, and destroying anything that he would characterize as a prized possession.&lt;ref name="Glover 1995"/&gt;{{rp|6}} Women would gather at the compound of the man in question, and sing and dance while detailing the women's grievances against him. The women would often bang on his hut, demolish it, or plaster it with mud. Actions like mistreating his wife or violating women's market rules were punishable by being "sit on." If necessary, these practices were continued until he repented and changed his ways.&lt;ref name="Glover 1995"/&gt;{{rp|146–48}}&lt;ref&gt;M. M. GREEN, op. cit., pp. 196-97; [[Sylvia Leith-Ross]], op. cit.,
p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/484197 "Sitting on a Man": Colonialism and the Lost Political Institutions of Igbo Women], Author: Judith van Allen, Source: Canadian Journal of African Studies / Revue Canadienne des Études Africaines, Vol. 6, No. 2, Special Issue: The Roles of African Women: Past, Present and Future (1972), pp. 170&lt;/ref&gt; During the March of [[Grand-Bassam]] the method of sitting on a man was also used when a man got his girlfriend arrested after she put his RDA card into her underwear. Women then invaded the courts and when threatened by police women began to dance and take their clothes off: a method used as a powerful form of resistance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Writing Africa: West Africa and the Sahel|last=Sutherland-Addy, Esi,|first=and Aminata Diaw|publisher=Feminist Press at the City University of New York|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|170}} The nakedness of women in many African and Sahelian communities was considered a taboo that indicated the force of power women had to stop the malfeasance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|204}} When it came to the Warrant Chiefs, along with singing and dancing around the houses and offices, the women would follow their every move, invading their space and forcing the men to pay attention. The wives of the Warrant Chiefs were often disturbed and they too put pressure on the Warrants to listen to the demands of the women. This tactic of "sitting on the Warrants," i.e. following them everywhere and anywhere, was very popular with the women in Nigeria, and used to great effect. Through the choice of clothing, the use of body language and choice of song, drew attention to the role and status of women in Nigeria, particularly in protection the good of the land. Other men in the village rarely came to their rescue and would say that they brought the wrath of women onto themselves.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|170}}

==Aba commission of enquiry==

The first commission of enquiry occurred in early January 1930, but was met with little success. The second inquiry, called the Aba commission, met in March 1930.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The commission held public sittings for thirty-eight days at various locations in the [[Owerri]] and [[Calabar]] Provinces and interviewed 485 witnesses. Of this total number of witnesses, only about 103 were women. The rest consisted of local men and British administrative officials who were either called to explain their role in the revolt or why they could not stop the women.&lt;ref&gt;Nigeria, Report of the Commission of Inquiry Appointed to Inquire into the Disturbances in the Calabar and Owerri Provinces,December, 1929 (Lagos: printed by the Government Printer, 1930) http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2014/10/nigeria-report-of-commission-of-inquiry.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==
The women were able to transform "traditional methods for networking and expressing disapproval" into powerful mechanisms that successfully challenged and disrupted the local colonial administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geiger|first=Susan|year=1990|title=Women and African Nationalism|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/363196/pdf|journal=Journal of Women's History|volume=2|pages=229|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's protests were carried out on a scale that the colonial state had never witnessed in any part of Africa. The rebellion extended over six thousand square miles containing all of Owerri and Calabar Provinces, home to roughly two million people.&lt;ref&gt;HarryA.GAILEY,Op.cit.,p.137;MargeyPERHAM, NativeAdministrationinNigeria,
op. cit., pp. 209-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the end of December 1929, when troops restored order, ten native courts were destroyed, a number of others were damaged, houses of native court personnel were attacked, and European factories at [[Imo River]], [[Aba, Abia|Aba]], Mbawsi, and Amata were looted. Women 46 attacked prisons and released prisoners. But the response of the colonial authority was also decisive. By the time order was restored, about fifty-five women were killed by the colonial troops. British troops left Owerri on the 27 December 1929, and the last patrol in Abak Division withdrew on 9 January 1930. By 10 January 1930, the revolt was regarded as crushed. Throughout late December 1929 and early January 1930, more than thirty collective punishment inquiries were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Chima J. Korieh, 'Gender and Peasant Resistance: Recasting the Myth of the Invisible Women in Colonial Eastern Nigeria, 1925-1945', in The Foundations of Nigeria: Essays in Honor of Toyin Falola, ed. Andrew C. Okolie (Africa World Press, 2003), 623–46, 632.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally believed, according to Nina Mba, that this event marked the end of the women's activities because the new administration under Governor Donald Cameron took into account some of the women's recommendations in revising the structure of the Native Administration. Thus, the Women's War is seen as the historical dividing point in British colonial administration in Nigeria with far reaching implications.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Mba, Nigerian Women Mobilized: Women's Political Activity in Southern Nigeria, 1900-1965 (Berkeley: University of California, 1982) and "Heroines of the Women's War," in Nigerian Women in Historical Perspectives ed. [[Bolanle Awe]] (Ibadan: Sankare/Bookcraft, 1992), 75-88&lt;/ref&gt; The Women's War was also instrumental in marking the rise of gender ideology, offering women who were not married to the elites the opportunity to engage in social actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, Culture and Development: A study of human capabilities|last=Glover|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=450|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the protests, the position of women in society was greatly improved. In some areas, women were able to replace the Warrant Chiefs. Women were also appointed to serve on the Native Courts. After the Women's war, women's movements were very strong in Ngwaland, many events in the 1930s, 40s and 50s were inspired by the Women's War, including the Tax Protests of 1938, the Oil Mill Protests of the 1940s in Owerri and Calabar Provinces and the Tax Revolt in Aba and Onitsha in 1956 {{ref|Oriji}}. On two occasions [[British Empire|British district officers]] were called and security forces forced to break up protests. During these occasions, at least 50 women were shot dead and 50 more wounded. The women themselves never seriously injured anybody against whom they were protesting, nor any of the security forces who broke up those protests.{{ref|Aborisade}}

== Name discrepancy ==
The event goes by many different names, including (but not limited to) Aba Women's Riots of 1929, Aba Women's War, and The Women's Market Rebellion of 1929. It is usually referred to as the "Aba Women's Riots of 1929" because that was how it was named in British Colonial records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The women utilized protest techniques that were traditional and specific to their communities, such as sitting on a man and wearing traditional ritual wear.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While the men in the community understood what those techniques and tactics meant, the British did not because they were outsiders. As such, the event appeared to be "crazy acts by hysterical women," thus calling the events riots.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Scholars have argued that calling the event "Aba Riots" de-politicizes the "feminist impetus" as well as frame the events through a colonialist lens.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Since the event was called "Ogu Umunwanyi" in Igbo and "Ekong Iban" in Ibibio by the local women—both of which translates to "women's war"—people have made a push to call it the "women's war" in order to take the event out of a colonialist lens and center it on the women involved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
