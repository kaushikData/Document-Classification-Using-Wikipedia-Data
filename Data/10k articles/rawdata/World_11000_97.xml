The '''8th Army Corps''' was one of three army corps of the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces]]. The Corps was headquartered in [[Zhytomyr]], Ukraine. In 2015 all army corps were dissolved and their units were transferred under jurisdiction of the operation command.

On 1 December 1993, after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the 8th Army Corps was formed by the redesignation of the [[8th Tank Army]]. The 23rd Tank Division at [[Ovruch]] became the 6065th Base for Storage of Weapons and Equipment and the 117th Training Tank Division later became the 119th District Training Centre. The 30th Tank Division became a Ukrainian mechanised brigade.

In March 2015, the 8th Army Corps was disbanded and its subordinate units transferred to other commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Новоград-Волинський: Коротко про головне|url = http://vybory.osp-ua.info/mista-idxnews-95730.html|website = vybory.osp-ua.info|access-date = 2016-02-12|language = Ukrainian|trans-title = Novohrad-Volynskyi: General News Summary|date = 20 March 2015|publisher = Institute of Society Transformation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Codex Alimentarius''''' is a collection of internationally recognized standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other recommendations relating to [[food]]s, food production, and [[food safety]].

Its name is derived from the [[Codex Alimentarius Austriacus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/v7700t/v7700t09.htm ''Codex Alimentarius'': how it all began] Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations website. Accessed 6 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Its texts are developed and maintained by the '''''Codex Alimentarius'' Commission''', a body that was established in early November 1961 by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] (FAO), was joined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in June 1962, and held its first session in Rome in October 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.org/about-codex/the-foundation-history-of-codex/en/ Codex timeline from 1945 to the present]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission's main goals are to [[consumer protection|protect the health of consumers]] and ensure fair practices in the international food trade. The Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the [[World Trade Organization]] as an international reference point for the [[Dispute resolution|resolution of disputes]] concerning food safety and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="wto.org"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/15sps_01_e.htm Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures] World Trade Organization. Accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/codex/Publications/understanding/Understanding_EN.pdf Understanding the Codex Alimentarius]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Preface. Third Edition. Published in 2006 by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, there were 186 members of the Codex Alimentarius Commission: 186 member countries and one member organization, the [[European Union]] (EU). There were 215 Codex observers: 49 [[intergovernmental organization]]s, 150 [[non-governmental organization]]s, and 16 [[United Nations System|United Nations organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.org/members-observers/observers/en/ Observers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The Codex Alimentarius covers all foods, whether processed, semi-processed or [[raw food|raw]]. In addition to standards for specific foods, the Codex Alimentarius contains general standards covering matters such as [[Food labelling regulations|food labeling]], food [[hygiene]], [[food additives]] and [[pesticide]] residues, and procedures for assessing the safety of foods derived from modern [[biotechnology]].  It also contains guidelines for the management of official i.e. governmental [[import]] and [[export]] inspection and [[certification]] systems for foods.

The Codex Alimentarius is published in the six [[official languages of the United Nations]]: [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CODEX Alimentarius: Understanding Codex|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.org/about-codex/understanding-codex/en/|publisher=FAO and WHO|accessdate=6 September 2012|year=1999|quote=Understanding Codex is available in English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Russian version.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Not all texts are available in all languages.

===General texts===
* [[Food labelling]] (general standard, guidelines on [[nutrition]] labelling, guidelines on labelling claims)
* [[Food additive]]s (general standard including authorized uses, specifications for food grade chemicals)
* [[Contaminant]]s in foods (general standard, tolerances for specific contaminants including [[radionuclide]]s, [[aflatoxin]]s and other [[mycotoxin]]s)
* [[Pesticide]] and veterinary chemical residues in foods (maximum residue limits)
* [[Risk assessment]] procedures for determining the safety of foods derived from biotechnology ([[DNA]]-modified plants, DNA-modified [[micro-organism]]s, [[allergens]])
* Food [[hygiene]] (general principles, codes of hygienic practice in specific industries or food handling establishments, guidelines for the use of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point or “[[HACCP]]” system)
* Methods of analysis and sampling

===Specific standards===
* [[Meat]] products (fresh, frozen, processed meats and [[poultry]])
* [[Fish]] and [[fishery]] products (marine, fresh water and [[aquaculture]])
* [[Milk]] and milk products
* Foods for special [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] uses (including [[infant formula]] and [[baby food]]s)
* Fresh and processed [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[fruit juice]]s
* [[Cereal]]s and derived products, dried [[legume]]s
* Fats, oils and derived products such as [[margarine]]
* Miscellaneous food products ([[chocolate]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[mineral water]])

==Controversy==
The controversy over the Codex Alimentarius relates to a perception that it is a mandatory [[Technical standard|standard]] for the safety of food, including vitamin and mineral supplements. Supporters of the Codex Alimentarius say that it is a voluntary reference standard for food and that there is no obligation on countries to adopt Codex standards as a member of either Codex or any other international trade organization. From the point of view of its opponents, however, one of the main causes of concern is that the Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the [[World Trade Organization]] as an international reference standard for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="wto.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Proponents argue that the use of Codex Alimentarius during international disputes does not exclude the use of other references or scientific studies as evidence of food safety and consumer protection.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

It is reported that in 1996 the German delegation put forward a proposal that no herb, vitamin or mineral should be sold for preventive or therapeutic reasons, and that supplements should be reclassified as drugs.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/sep/14/medicineandhealth.lifeandhealth 'Health supplements: R.I.P.'. The Guardian newspaper, UK.] Published 14 September 2002. Accessed 2 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was agreed, but protests halted its implementation.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; The 28th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission was subsequently held July 4–9, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/codex/alinorm05/al28_41e.pdf Codex Alimentarius Commission 28th Session, FAO Headquarters, Rome, Italy, 4-9 July, 2005. Official report.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many issues discussed were the ''Guidelines for [[Vitamin]] and Mineral [[Dietary supplement|Food Supplements]]'',&lt;ref name="codexalimentarius.net"&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/10206/cxg_055e.pdf Codex Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements]&lt;/ref&gt; which were adopted during the meeting as new global safety guidelines: The guidelines state that "people should...be encouraged to select a balanced diet from food before considering any vitamin and mineral supplement. In cases where the intake from the diet is insufficient or where consumers consider their diet requires supplementation, vitamin and mineral food supplements serve to supplement the daily diet."&lt;ref name="codexalimentarius.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="un2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN commission adopts safety guidelines for vitamin and food supplements|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=14974&amp;Cr=codex&amp;Cr1|publisher=United Nations News Centre|accessdate=17 September 2012|date=11 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text has been the subject of considerable controversy among proponents of [[dietary supplements]]. Many countries regulate such substances as therapeutic goods or [[pharmaceutical]]s or by some other category, without requiring them to be shown to be medically useful.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The text does not seek to ban supplements, but subjects them to labeling and packaging requirements, sets criteria for the setting of maximum and minimum dosage levels, and requires that safety and efficacy are considered when determining ingredient sources. The [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) will implement these criteria with "labelling to stop consumers overdosing on vitamin and mineral food supplements." The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) has said that the Guidelines call "for labelling that contains information on maximum consumption levels of vitamin and mineral food supplements." The WHO has also said that the Guidelines "ensure that consumers receive beneficial health effects from vitamins and minerals."&lt;ref name=un2005 /&gt;

In 2004, similarities were noted between the EU's [[Food Supplements Directive]] and the Codex Alimentarius draft guidelines for vitamin and mineral supplements'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nil by mouth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/feb/29/health.shopping|publisher=The Observer, Guardian UK|accessdate=17 September 2012|author=Rose Shepherd|date=29 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional controversy has been expressed by proponents of ecologically and socially sustainable agriculture and food systems, such as the [[Slow Food]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slowfood.com/international/1/about-us|title=Slow Food International|last=|first=|date=|website=Slow Food International|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905122146/http://www.slowfood.com/international/1/about-us|archive-date=2012-09-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Slow Food movement has become more closely aligned with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slowfood.com About us, Slow Food] "Slow Food gratefully acknowledges funding support from the European Commission."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Manifesto on the Future of Food stated that "bureaucracies like the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Codex Alimentarius have codified policies designed to serve the interests of global agribusiness above all others, while actively undermining the rights of farmers and consumers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manifesto on the Future of Food | author=The International Commission on the Future of Food and Agriculture | date=July 15, 2003 | url=http://www.farmingsolutions.org/pdfdb/manifestoinglese.pdf | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050602203751/http://www.farmingsolutions.org/pdfdb/manifestoinglese.pdf | archivedate=June 2, 2005 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Columbus Hotel Monte-Carlo''' is a 3-star boutique hotel located at 23, Avenue des Papalins in the [[ Monaco|Fontvieille]] area of western [[Monaco]]. It was created by Scottish hotelier [[Ken McCulloch]] in partnership with [[Formula One]] racing car driver [[David Coulthard]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/in-the-drivers-seat-david-coulthards-16330m-hotel-haul-1980367.html|title=In the driver's seat: David Coulthard's £30m hotel haul|date=23 May 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=April date set for first opening in McCulloch's Columbus hotel chain|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/20/07/2000/28239/April-date-set-for-first-opening-in-McCulloch39s-Columbus-hotel-chain.htm|publisher=Caterer Search|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; until McCulloch sold his shares in 2008 to concentrate in developing his Dakota hotels in the UK. Coulthard sold out to [[London and Regional Properties]] in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coulthard’s Columbus in Monaco sold|url=http://www.rivieratimes.com/index.php/business-article/items/coulthards-columbus-in-monaco-sold.html|publisher=''The Riviera Times''|accessdate=30 September 2015|date=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel was opened on April 21, 2001 by [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco]].

The interior of the hotel was originally designed by international designer [[Amanda Rosa]] (McCulloch's wife)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amanda Rosa Interiors|url=http://www.amandarosa.com/|publisher=Amanda Rosa Interiors|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the [[cosy and boutique]] style with light colour palettes and natural furnishings of [[leather]], [[marble]], [[wood]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbushotels.com/english/rooms/|title=Accommodation in Monte-Carlo - Columbus Hotel Monte-Carlo|website=www.columbusmonaco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MCH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monte-carlomonaco.com/columbushotel.php|title=Monte Carlo Hotels|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308164454/http://www.monte-carlohotels.com/columbushotel.php|archivedate=2010-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel has 157 rooms and 23 suites, 1 apartment and a lobby bar. An extensive program of renovation started in August 2017 to be completed by April 2018. 13 studio &amp; apartments and 1 penthouse will be created, along with the refurbishment of the 181 rooms and suites - Certified Clef Verte (Green Key) - &lt;ref name="MCH"/&gt;

The hotel and Coulthard featured in an episode of [[Piers Morgan]]'s travelogue series ''[[Piers Morgan on...]]'' looking at [[Monaco]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">The '''Constitution (Amendment No. 11) Act 1929''' was an Act amending the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]].  It amended Article 34 of the constitution regarding the filling of casual vacancies in [[Seanad Eireann]].

As enacted, Article 34 provided that vacancies would be filled by a vote of the Seanad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/enacted/en/print.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 11th amendment, the provision was changed to provide that the vote would be by members of [[Dail Eireann]] and Seanad Eireann voting together (which remains the procedure to this day under the 1937 constitution).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1929/act/34/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act became obsolete on the repeal of the 1922 Constitution by the [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, and has formally been repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2016/1616/B16b16S.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statute Law Revision Bill 2016 |website=Oireachtas.ie |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenya's 1963 independence constitution''' was based on the standard "[[Lancaster House Conferences (Kenya)|Lancaster House template]]" used for the former British colonies in Africa, was subject to early amendments, and was replaced in 1969. 

Under the [[Constitution of Kenya]], the [[British monarch]], [[Queen Elizabeth II]], was represented as [[head of state]] by a [[Governor-General of Kenya]]. The Constitution also provided for a [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of Kenya|parliament]], the [[National Assembly of Kenya|National Assembly]], consisting of the [[Senate of Kenya|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of Kenya|House of Representatives]]. Each [[Provinces of Kenya|province]] had an elected assembly. 

In 1964, the Constitution was amended to make the country a [[republic]] with the [[President of Kenya|President]] as both head of state and head of government, and in 1966, the membership of the Senate and House of Representatives was combined to form a [[unicameral]] National Assembly.

'''"Frère Jacques"''' ("Brother John") was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1977]], performed in [[French language|French]] by [[France|French]] singer [[Anne-Marie Besse]].

As the title suggests, the [[disco]]-influenced song contains several references to [[Frère Jacques|the nursery rhyme of the same name]]; ''"Frère Jacques, dormez-vous?" ("Brother John, are you sleeping?") "J'entends les cloches qui sonnent" ("I can hear the bells ringing")'' and ''"Tu aurais bien mieux à faire que de jouer au grand frère..." ("There are so much better things for you to do than pretending to be my big brother....")''. The singer compares the childish rhyme to her current adulthood, singing about how she longs to have a relationship with some of Jacques/John's friends; ''"I'm not a child anymore, you know"''. The song ends with the line ''"Frère Jacques, réveille-toi et viens dormir avec moi..." ("Brother John, wake up and come sleep with me...")''.

The song was performed seventh on the night, following [[Germany]]'s [[Silver Convention]] with "[[Telegram (song)|Telegram]]" and preceding [[Portugal]]'s [[Os Amigos]] with "[[Portugal no coração]]". At the close of voting, it had received 17 points, placing 16th in a field of 18.

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978 Contest]] by [[Baccara]] with "[[Parlez-vous français?]]".

'''Hadiya ('''ሃድያ: Hadiya or Hadiyya) is the [[Ethiopian]] ethnic group of people who speak the [[Hadiyya language]]. However, proper historical definition of Hadiya people includes a number of Ethiopian ethnic groups currently known by other names according to ethnologist Ulrich Braukämper who lived in various parts of southern-central Ethiopia for over four years during his research &lt;ref name="Braukämper2012"&gt;{{cite book | last = Braukämper | first = Ulrich | title = A history of the Hadiyya in Southern Ethiopia | publisher = Harrassowitz Verlag | location = Wiesbaden | year = 2012 | isbn = 9783447068048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book titled A history of the Hadiyya in Southern Ethiopia he establishes linkages to ancient [[Hadiya Kingdom]] the current ethnic groups of [[Halaba people]] (Allaaba or Alaba), Silt'e or Selte [[Silt'e people]], "Hadiyya" clans of the Arisi-Oromo &amp; Ittuu-Oromo, and "Clans of Hadiyya origin in Wälaytta" in addition to current speakers of [[Hadiyya language]] in [[Hadiya Zone]] &amp; the Libidoo (speakers of [[Libido language]] dialect) of [[Mareko (woreda)|Mareko]] in [[Gurage Zone]]. 

The [[Hadiya Zone]] is named after the Hadiya people, whose homeland covers part of this [[Zones of Ethiopia|administrative division]].  The 2007 Ethiopian national census reported that 1,269,382 people (or 1.5% of the population) identified themselves as Hadiya, of whom 150,087 were urban inhabitants. The [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]] is home to 93.9% of this people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=264&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=521 "Census 2007, Country Level"] now it is projected as reaching 3 million, Table 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arsinoitherium hharder.png|thumb|right|[[Heinrich Harder]]'s reconstruction of ''[[Arsinoitherium zitteli]]'' in the Oligocene grassland of [[Jebel Qatrani]] escarpment.]]
The '''Jebel Qatrani Formation''' is a [[paleontology|palaeontological]]  and [[geologic formation]] located  in the [[Faiyum Governorate]] of central [[Egypt]].

Conformably{{check|date=November 2012}} overlying the [[Qasr el Sagha Formation]]. It is exposed namely between the [[Jebel Qatrani]] escarpment and the Qasr el Sagha [[escarpment]], north of [[Birket Qarun]] lake near [[Faiyum]].

==Geology==
These rocks were laid down in the [[Eocene]]-[[Oligocene]] period ([[Priabonian]] - [[Rupelian]]){{check|date=November 2012}}.  This formation was originally thought to be between 35.4 and 33.3 million years old, based on initial analysis of the formation. However, analysis by Erik Seiffert in 2006 concluded that the age of the Jebel Qatrani Formation should be revised. His assessment of more recent evidence indicates an age for most of the formation of between 30.2 and 29.5 million years ago, placing it almost entirely in the [[Rupelian|Early Oligocene]]. Seiffert states that only the lowest 48 metres was laid down in the [[Eocene]],&lt;ref name="Seiffert"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seiffert Erik R. |title=Revised age estimates for the later Paleogene mammal faunas of Egypt and Oman|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=103 |issue=13 |pages=5000–5005 |date=Jan 2006 | |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/13/5000.short| doi=10.1073/pnas.0600689103 |pmc=1458784}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent opinion holds the original hypothesis of a sediment straddling the Eocene-Oligocene boundary to be correct.{{Citation needed|reason=Cannot find any contradiction of Seiffert, everything found stating older appears to be from the 1990's, found one article published 2014 but that was an online republishing of Prothero&amp;Berggren(1992)|date=October 2017}}

Mostly [[sandstone]]s deposited by meandering rivers and seasonal lakes, the lower (Eocene) part of the formation represents a woodlanded ecosystem of which lots of [[petrified wood]] also remain. In contrast, the upper (Oligocene) layers present indication of much drier and cooler conditions, with [[savanna]] replacing the woodland for several million years before the climate turned wetter and warmer again and the forests regrew.

The [[fauna]] changes also notably during this time, which seems to be coincident with the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]] recorded in Eurasia.

[[File:Kongebjorka.jpeg|thumb|The iconic photograph of King Haakon VII and Crown Prince Olav seeking shelter under the birch tree during a German bombing raid in April 1940]]
The '''Royal Birch''' ({{lang-no|Kongebjørka}}) is a Norwegian national symbol and memorial of the [[Nazi occupation of Norway]] during [[World War II]]. It is located at Glomstua in the  city of [[Molde]] in [[More og Romsdal]], Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molde.kommune.no/kongebjoerka-og-fredslunden.5123076-266044.html ''Kongebjørka og Fredslunden'' (Kongebjørka i Molde)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mr.kulturnett.no/institusjon/kongebj%C3%B8rka ''Kongebjørka ved Glomstua i Molde'' (Møre og Romsdal kulturnett)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King Haakon VII]] and [[King Olav V|Crown Prince Olav]] was photographed by [[Per Bratland]] seeking shelter under the [[birch tree]] during a German [[bombing raid]] during the last weekend of April 1940. The iconic image was spread across the world and inspired further resistance to the occupation. It also inspired the poet [[Nordahl Grieg]], who was also in the area during the bombing, to write his poem ''Kongen''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Kongebj%C3%B8rka ''Kongebjørka'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitnorway.com/us/Product/?pid=32946 ''The Royal Birch and the Peace Grove'' (visitnorway.us)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, a memorial was erected near the tree. Close to the Royal Birch is a Peace Grove (''Fredslunden'') which was inaugurated in 1997. The original birch tree was destroyed by vandals in 1981, but a new birch tree was planted by [[King Olav V]] in 1982. During the 1992 New Year's storm, the replacement tree was destroyed, and a third tree was subsequently planted by [[King Harald V]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/Kongebj%C3%B8rka ''Kongebjørka'' (lokalhistoriewiki.no)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Kronprinsparet-ved-Kongebjorka-6837269.html ''Kronprinsparet ved Kongebjørka'' (Aftenposten 26.mai. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Le Pèlerin de Camp Nou''' ([[English language|English]]: "Captain Majid") is a 2009 feature film produced in the north-central African country of Chad. A work of "no-budget" digital cinema, it experienced international release at the Festival du Film PanAfricain in Cannes, France, in April 2009, and was featured at festivals in Montreal, Toronto, and London in 2009 before screening at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivaldufilmpanafricain.org/dossiers/dossiers.php?val=93_selection+officielle ''Sélection Officielle''] Festival du Film PanAfricain&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
Majid (Abakar Chene Massar) duels his own coach (Ousman Adoum) for the heart of team president's daughter Faiza (Nadech Ngaryo). Faiza, an avid football fan herself, makes her intentions clear: she will be devoted to one and one only.

Majid is almost sidelined in the town championship game but manages to lead his team to victory. His dream of playing international football is matched in intensity only by a budding relationship with Faiza and the upcoming academic exams that will determine his future. All is at stake, however, when local drugs threaten to throw Majid into a downward spiral.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1391623/synopsis ''Le Pèlerin de Camp Nou synopsis''] The Internet Movie Database (IMDB)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bulgaria-SanStefano -(1878)-byTodorBozhinov.png|thumb|A map which shows the territories of the liberated Bulgarian [[Tributary state]] in 1878 and its dividing at the same year with adoption of [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]]]
In [[Bulgaria]]n [[historiography]], the '''liberation of Bulgaria''' refers to those events of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] that led to the re-establishment of the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[Sovereign state|state]] under the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] of 3 March 1878.

The [[treaty]], championed and written by the honorable Peter, forced the [[Ottoman Empire]] give back to Bulgaria most of its territory conquered in 14th century. At the Berlin Congress of the same year, the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] was adopted, according to which the territories of the Bulgarian state, established as per the San Stefano treaty, were divided into three parts: the first part was the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], which functioned independently but was nominally a [[Vassal state|vassal]] of the Ottoman Empire and was limited to [[Moesia]] and areas adjacent to the capital [[Sofia]]; the second part was to be an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire—[[Eastern Rumelia]]; the third and largest part—all of the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Lozengrad]]—were restored to the Ottoman Empire while some outlands were assigned to Serbia and Romania. Those territories seized from Bulgaria after the Berlin Congress, including most of Macedonia, Thrace and others, had a majority ethnic Bulgarian population. On 6 September 1885, [[Bulgarian unification|Eastern Rumelia became part of the Principality of Bulgaria]] after a bloodless unification, although the principality was a ''[[de facto]]'' independent nation but ''[[de jure]]'' vassal nation of the Ottoman Empire until 1908, when Bulgaria proclaimed its [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]].

The 1908 declaration, which signified Bulgaria's break with the [[Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]], was actually the second liberation of Bulgaria. After the conquest of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in 1018, the first liberation of Bulgaria led to the establishment of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in the aftermath of the [[Uprising of Asen and Peter]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1185.

[[Gibraltar]] is a [[British overseas territory]] with many musical influences. [[Rock music|Rock]] based [[music]] is undergoing a [[renaissance]] with a multitude of local bands playing original material and covers. Local venues have begun accepting [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] bands and those from nearby [[Spain]], resulting in a varied mix of live performances every weekend as well as some weekday nights.

Musicians from Gibraltar include [[Charles Ramirez]], the first [[guitar]]ist invited to play with the [[Royal College of Music]] Orchestra,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronicle.gi/Features/Charles%20Ramirez/charles%20ramirez.htm ''The Gibraltar Chronicle'' Always a pleasure to perform in Gibraltar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030909225847/http://www.chronicle.gi/Features/Charles%20Ramirez/charles%20ramirez.htm |date=2003-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and successful [[rock band]]s like [[Breed 77]], [[Melon Diesel]] and [[Taxi (Gibraltar band)|Taxi]].

The best known Gibraltarian musician is [[Albert Hammond]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foghs.org.uk/nl/70.pdf Friends of Gibraltar Heritage Society Newsletter No 70 November 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; who has had top 10 hits in the UK &amp; US, and has written many songs for international artists such as [[Whitney Houston]], [[Tina Turner]] and [[Julio Iglesias]] among many others.

Concerts in Gibraltar by well known international acts have recently given local acts a showcase for original material in their supporting roles. These include [[Surianne]] supporting [[Suzanne Vega]], Sarah Howard supporting [[Steve Hogarth]], Jetstream supporting [[Ali Campbell]] and [[Jessie J]] and SuperWookie supporting [[Marillion]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2007/10-2007.pdf Government of Gibraltar press release - Announcement of Marillion Concert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118191214/http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2007/10-2007.pdf |date=2008-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the annual [[Gibraltar Music Festival]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6942">'''Optic Nerve''' is a [[mass surveillance]] programme run by the British [[signals intelligence]] agency [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), with help from the US [[National Security Agency]], that surreptitiously collects private [[webcam]] still images from users while they are using a [[Yahoo!]] [[webcam]] application. As an example of the scale, in one 6-month period, the programme is reported to have collected images from 1.8 million Yahoo! user accounts globally. The programme was first reported on in the media in February 2014, from documents leaked by the former [[National Security Agency]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]], but dates back to a prototype started in 2008, and was still active in at least 2012.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo|title=Yahoo webcam images from millions of users intercepted by GCHQ|work=The Guardian|first=Spencer |last=Ackerman |first2=James |last2=Ball|date=27 February 2014|accessdate= 28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perlroth-NYT/&gt;

The leaked documents describe the users under surveillance as "unselected", meaning that data was collected indiscriminately in bulk from users regardless of whether they were an intelligence target or not. The vast majority of affected users would have been completely innocent of any crime or suspicion of a crime. Optic Nerve as described in the documents collected one still image every 5 minutes per user, attempting to comply with human rights legislation.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The images were collected in a searchable database, and used for experiments in [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition]], to monitor known targets, and to discover new targets. The choice of Yahoo! for surveillance was taken because "Yahoo webcam is known to be used by GCHQ targets". Unlike the US [[NSA]], the UK GCHQ is not required by law to minimize the collection from domestic citizens, so UK citizens could have been targeted on the same level as non-UK citizens.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perlroth-NYT/&gt;

The story was broken by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in February 2014, and is based on leaked documents dating to between 2008 and 2012. Yahoo! expressed outrage at the programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://world.time.com/2014/02/27/nsa-leaks-edward-snowden-gchq-yahoo-webcam-spying/ | work = Time | title = Report: U.K. Spy Agency Stored Millions of Webcam Images| accessdate = 28 February 2014 | first = Denver| last = Nicks|date = 27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when approached by ''The Guardian'', and subsequently called it "a whole new level of violation of our users' privacy."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;  A GCHQ spokesperson stated "It is a long-standing policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters".&lt;ref name=Perlroth-NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/27/us-usa-security-britain-idUSBREA1Q1XX20140227| publisher = Reuters|accessdate = 28 February 2014 | date = 27 February 2014 | first = Julia | last = Fioretti| title = British spy agency collected images of Yahoo! webcam chats: Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there were some limits to which photos security analysts were allowed to see, with bulk searches limited to metadata, security analysts were allowed to see "webcam images associated with similar Yahoo identifiers to your known target".&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perlroth-NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlroth|first=Nicole|title=British Spies Said to Intercept Yahoo Webcam Images|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/technology/british-spies-said-to-have-intercepted-yahoo-webcam-images.html?hpw&amp;rref=technology&amp;_r=1|accessdate=28 February 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
Optic Nerve worked by collecting the information from GCHQ's large network of [[network tap|Internet cable taps]], feeding into systems provided by the United States' [[National Security Agency]]. NSA research was used to build the tool to isolate the webcam traffic.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

Given that both Yahoo! Messenger chats and webcam streams are sent unencrypted, it would have been relatively easy (though not trivial) to intercept the webcam traffic.&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/27/gchq_optic_nerve/|title=UK spies on MILLIONS of Yahoo! webcams, ogles sex vids - report|publisher=The Register|date=27 February 2014|author=Jack Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Snowden leaks, Yahoo! planned to give all users the option to encrypt all communications with Yahoo!'s servers by April, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/67373852814/our-commitment-to-protecting-your-information|title=Our Commitment to Protecting Your Information|publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexually explicit images==
Between 3% and 11% of the images captured by the webcams were sexually explicit in nature &lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; and deemed "undesirable nudity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/yahoo-webcam-users-intimate-images-intercepted-by-gchq-spy-programme-snowden-files-reveal-9158140.html | work = The Independent | accessdate = 28 February 2014 | date = 27 February 2014 | title = British agents spied on Yahoo users' 'intimate' webcam images, Snowden files reveal  | first = Ian | last = Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Unfortunately … it would appear that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate parts of their body to the other person. Also, the fact that the Yahoo! software allows more than one person to view a webcam stream without necessarily sending a reciprocal stream means that it appears sometimes to be used for broadcasting pornography.}}

==Other webcam traffic targets==
The documents mentioned interest in monitoring the video from the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]]'s [[Kinect]] camera,&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; something which [[Microsoft]] has reported it was oblivious to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GCHQ identified Kinect as possible snooping tool; Microsoft denies all knowledge|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/gchq-identified-kinect-as-possible-snooping-tool/0128871|work=The Market for Computer and Video Games|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
{{quote|This is a truly shocking revelation that underscores the importance of the debate on privacy now taking place and the reforms being considered.

The '''Public Eye on Davos''', held every year between 2000 and 2015, was a counter-event to the annual meeting of the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]].

The project involved [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) from around the world and was coordinated by Swiss organizations [[Erklärung von Bern]] (EvB, renamed "Public Eye" in 2016) and [[Greenpeace]] Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evb.ch/en/f25001565.html |title=Berne Declaration - Public Eye Awards 2009 |publisher=Evb.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Eye is a platform for substantial criticism of "purely profit-oriented globalization".&lt;ref name="publiceyeawards.ch"/&gt;  The focus of the Public Eye Awards since 2005 has been on [[corporate social responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evb.ch/en/p14518.html |title=Berne Declaration - Public Eye Awards 2009 |publisher=Evb.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Positive category was for the first time awarded for a courageous employee for his or her exemplary contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evb.ch/cm_data/Nominationsaufruf_e.pdf |title=Zurich, August 118,2008 - open letter |publisher=Evb.ch |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Public Eye was first hold in the year 2000 to accompany the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) in [[Davos]] critically. Together with the newspaper [[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung|WOZ]] they organized an event under the name ″Who rules the world″ and organized a public discussion with the president of the WEF, [[Klaus Schwab]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lora.ch/events/davos/wef2000/events.htm ''Auf nach Davos.''] Event Calendar of the [[Radio LoRa|Radio Lora]]. Visited on the 8.6.2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year the Public Eye was extended to a multiple day counter-conference with 20 participants from [[NGO]]s and critical scientists. They also followed the WEF to New York in 2002, where the [[President of the Swiss Confederation]], [[Kaspar Villiger]], opened the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Hollingdale |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/new-york-prepares-for-the-wef-and-public-eye/2515826 |title=New York prepares for the WEF and Public Eye |publisher=[[Swissinfo]] |date=2002-01-21 |accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 they introduced the Public Eye Awards as a renewal of the event, which was in future the main event of the Public Eye on Davos. In 2007, after [[Pro Natura (Switzerland)|Pro Natura]] stopped working on the event because the use of the event was too one-sited on the organizers of the WEF, [[Greenpeace]] was beside [[Erklärung von Bern]] the new organizing partner of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://zeitungsarchiv.nzz.ch/neue-zuercher-zeitung-vom-25-01-2007-seite-25.html Neue Zürcher Zeitung from 25 January 2007, page 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Eye celebrated its ten-year anniversary on 28 January 2009.&lt;ref name="publiceyeawards.ch"&gt;{{cite web|author=Feinheit |url=http://www.publiceyeawards.ch/de/p63000130.html |title=Public Eye Awards kriegen Unterstützung von renommierten Wirtschaftsethikern - Public Eye Awards 2012 |language=de |publisher=Publiceyeawards.ch |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Davos was for the last time the venue of the Public Eye Award with [[Chevron Corporation]] as winner of the lifetime award.&lt;ref name="schweizaktuell-20150116"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/schweiz-aktuell/fixer-eurokurs-im-wallis-wef-ohne-demos|title=WEF ohne Kritiker|publisher=[[Schweiz aktuell]]|author=|language=German|date=2015-01-16|accessdate=2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evb-bibidavos"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.evb.ch/medien/medienmitteilung/public_eye_davoser_abschiedsfeuerwerk_mit_lifetime_award_und_den_yes_men/|title=Public Eye: Davoser Abschiedsfeuerwerk mit "Lifetime Award" und den Yes Men|publisher=[[Erklärung von Bern]]|author=|language=German|date=2014-11-19|accessdate=2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Winner of the Lifetime Award: [[Chevron Corporation]]
Chevron was 'awarded' namely for its activities of the past 10 years in Bolivia, that caused enormous ecological damage.&lt;ref name="tagesschau-20150123-6pm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/tagesschau|title=Tagesschau 23 January 2015 at 18:00|publisher=Swiss Television SRF|author=|language=German|date=2015-01-23|accessdate=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Schweiz aktuell]] broadcast on 16 January 2015, a public presence during the WEF 2015 may not be guaranteed because the massively increased security in Davos. The Public Eye Award will be awarded for the last time in Davos: ''Public Eyes says Goodbye to Davos'', confirmed by the Rolf Marugg (now ''Landrats'' politician), by not directly enganed politicians, and by the police responsible.&lt;ref name="schweizaktuell-20150116"/&gt; As communicated before by [[Erklärung von Bern]] on 19 November 2014, following the announcement of the ''Lifetime Award'' winner on 23 January 2015, a closing conference will be hold, with the participation of the ''[[Yes Men]]'', [[Sven Giegold]], the [[Attac]] co-founder and [[Members of the European Parliament 2009–14|European Parliamentarian]], and [[Adrian Monck]] as Managing Director und Head of Public Engagement of the WEF association, as well as [[Noreena Hertz]], economy professor and best-selling author.&lt;ref name="evb-bibidavos"/&gt;

*Winners: [[Gazprom]], [[Gap Inc.|Gap]]

In December 2013, Gazprom became the first company in the world to start drilling for oil in the Arctic Barents Sea. Since the drilling began, the corporation has already violated several federal safety and environmental regulations. 
Fashion giant Gap has refused to sign the binding agreement «Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh». Instead, it is actively undermining serious reform by promoting a non-binding corporate-controlled program.&lt;ref name="woz-20140109"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woz.ch/1402/public-eye-awards/koenige-der-ausbeuter|title=Public Eye Awards: Könige der Ausbeuter|publisher=[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]] 02/2014|author=Mario Walser|language=German|date=2014-01-09|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SeaDefenseZoneMap.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Chart of Kriegsmarine Sea Defense Zones]] --&gt;
A '''sea defense zone''' (''Seeverteidigung'') was a tactical area in the [[organization of the Kriegsmarine]] intended to provide operational command of all German naval forces, within a [[Naval regions and districts of the Kriegsmarine|given geographical area]], in the event of actual enemy attack on the coastline of [[German-occupied Europe|occupied Europe]].

==History==

The first sea defense zones were established in the spring of 1940 to protect the large amount of coast line which Germany had acquired after invading the [[Low Countries]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[France]]. Originally, commanders of the sea defense zones were known as "coastal commanders" (''Küstenbefehlshaber'').  In the summer of 1940, in preparation for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the Kriegsmarine established seven "sea command sectors" (''Seebefehlsstellen'') which were commanded by officers ranked ''[[Kapitän zur See]]''.  All of the sea command sectors had been disestablished by the end of 1941.

'''Original Sea Command Sectors (1940)'''

* ''Seebefehlsstelle Antwerpen'' - [[Antwerp]] (Sep 1940 - May 1941)
* ''Seebefehlsstelle Boulogne'' - [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] (Aug - Oct 1940)
* ''Seebefehlsstelle Dünkirchen'' - [[Dunkirk]] (Aug - Oct 1940)
* ''Seebefehlshaber Le Havre'' - [[Le Havre]] (Aug - Oct 1940)
* ''Seebefehlshaber Rotterdam'' - [[Rotterdam]] (Jun 1940 - Dec 1940)
* ''Seebefehlshaber Ostende'' - [[Ostend]] (Aug - Oct 1940)
* ''Seebefehlshaber West'' - [[Calais]] (Aug 1940 - Mar 1941)	

In the spring 1940, the Kriegsmarine began to reorganize coastal defense under a new position known as ''Kommandant der Seeverteidigung'' (Sea Defense Zone Commander).  Between 1941 and 1945, the sea defense zones were expanded and retracted, gaining and losing territory to other zones or to the advance of [[Allies of World War II|allied]] or [[Red Army]] ([[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) forces.  Logistically, the sea defense zones were strictly a Navy command, but were integrated into the [[Atlantic Wall]] which was generally overseen by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]].

==Command and control==

Sea defense zones were normally commanded by an officer ranked as either ''[[Kapitän zur See]]'' or ''[[Konteradmiral]]''. The sea defense zone commander answered to a Navy [[Naval regions and districts of the Kriegsmarine#Naval regions|regional commander]] and would take tactical control over all shore forces in a given area should an enemy launch an attack against a segment of German coastline.

The only units permanently assigned to a sea defense zone were [[naval artillery]] batteries and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] units.  These units also maintained their own administrative chain of command in addition to falling under operational control of a sea defense zone.  During an actual enemy attack, the sea defense commander became the direct superior for all Navy units in the zone's geographical area.  This included all [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine#Harbor Security Commands|harbor defense unit]]s as well as [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine#Naval Infantry|naval infantry]] regiments.  Typically, the sea defense zone commander would appoint as a deputy the commander of a [[List of German naval ports during World War II|major German port]].  The defense zone commander would himself report to a naval region commander who then acted in the capacity as a ground forces [[Division (military)|divisional commander]].  The ultimate command authority for all sea defense zones were the [[Organization of the Kriegsmarine#Navy Group Commands|Navy Group commander]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1609">'''Shoreditch TV''' is a local [[community television]] station broadcasting to residents of [[Shoreditch]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref name=rights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutedisaster.co.uk/digitalbridge/sdtv/index.php |title=Digital Bridge - Shoreditch TV |publisher=Absolutedisaster.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experimental 'Crime' channel broadcasts live [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] from the streets of Shoreditch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4597990.stm |title=Rights group criticises 'Asbo TV' |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-01-10 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents can compare those on the streets to a 'gallery of rogues' and report to Police anyone breaching an [[ASBO]] or acting suspiciously. 
This concept has been criticised by civil rights campaigners, who have dubbed it [[ASBO]] TV. Matt Foot from ASBO Concern said 'Here, you will have a situation of people spying on each other, which raises concerns about vigilantism and vulnerable people such as children being bullied on CCTV'.&lt;ref name=rights/&gt;
The channel is currently available to 22,000 viewers.

'''Tado''' (formerly '''Ezame''') is a village in south east [[Togo]], near the border with [[Benin]].

Tradition states that Tado was the birthplace of the [[Aja (people)|Aja people]] at some point in the 12th or 13th century.  Today the Aja populate the south part of Togo and Benin.  It is also the reputed birthplace of [[Gangnihessou]], the first king of [[Dahomey]], in the 16th century.

Today Tado is a centre of [[pilgrim]]age for Aja people from across the region, who visit the village each August to pray for their ancestral spirits.

'''''The Juba Post''''' (also: '''''The Juba Post Newspaper''''') is an independent English-language newspaper in [[South Sudan]]. It currently has offices in both [[Juba]] and [[Khartoum]]. It is the first independent newspaper of South Sudan based in Juba, the capital of the [[Republic of South Sudan]]. The newspaper is owned by the Juba Media Company. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is Charles Rehan Surur. In 2011 the newspaper had a circulation of 2500 biweekly issues. It is financially supported by advertising and subscription. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The newspaper was established in 2004 by a group of displaced Southern Sudanese and students from [[Juba University]] in Khartoum, who were brought together by Hildebrand Bijleveld. It appeared initially in Khartoum as an unlicensed bi-lingual (Arabic/English) weekly before the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] was signed between the Khartoum government and the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] on 9 July 2005, leading to the Independence of South Sudan on 9 July 2011. 

The National Press Council in Khartoum issued in October 2004 an official letter to all the printing and publishing companies in Sudan not to print the newspaper. Despite this warning, the paper continued to appear and was even openly sold at newsstands in Khartoum. The paper was issued a license by the National Press Council on 23 March 2005, but almost immediately ran into difficulty.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Following reports by the newspaper on the expulsion of [[internally displaced person]]s from a camp in [[Khartoum]] and closing of the daily newspaper ''[[The Khartoum Monitor]]'', ''The Juba Post'' was shut down by the government and three of its reporters were jailed on the charge of being "illegal journalists." ''The Juba Post'' returned to operations shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article10338 "The Juba Post suspended"], press release, ''The Juba Post'', 23 June 2005 (hosted by ''[[Sudan Tribune]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Juba Post'' was for several years the only newspaper based in Juba, the capital of South Sudan. Over the years, a number of its editors and managers have been arrested by authorities after publishing articles concerning ethnic tension, lack of rule of law and corruption.

The newspaper's most current online issue is dated 12 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejubapost.org/ Welcome to the Frontpage], ''The Juba Post'', 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

USA-49 was launched at 18:10:01 UTC on 11 December 1989, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D190, flying in the 6925 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-49 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2.htm|title=GPS-2 (Navstar-2)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 1990, USA-49 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20009|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20357|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 718 minutes, and 54.9 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operated in slot 3 of plane D of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite had a mass of {{convert|840|kg}}, and generated 710 watts of power.&lt;ref name="NSSDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1989-097A|title=Navstar 2-05|publisher=US National Space Science Data Center|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a design life of 7.5 years,&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; and ceased operations on 23 February 2005.

'''World Hepatitis Day''', observed on July 28 every year, aims to [[raising awareness|raise global awareness]] of [[hepatitis]] — a group of infectious diseases known as Hepatitis [[hepatitis A|A]], [[hepatitis B|B]], [[hepatitis C|C]], [[Hepatitis D|D]], and [[Hepatitis E|E]] — and encourage prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Hepatitis affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, causing acute and chronic disease and killing close to 1.4 million people every year.&lt;ref name=WHOcampaign&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/hepatitis-day/2013/en/ World Hepatitis Day.] Accessed 8 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

World Hepatitis Day is one of eight official [[global health|global public health]] campaigns marked by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), along with [[World Health Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World Immunization Week]], [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Malaria Day]] and [[World AIDS Day]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/en WHO campaigns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hepatitis groups, patients and advocates worldwide take part in events on 28 July. Notably in 2012, a Guinness World Record was created when 12,588 people from 20 countries did the [[Three Wise Monkeys]] actions on World Hepatitis Day to signify the willful ignorance of the disease.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==History==
The inaugural International Hepatitis C Awareness day, coordinated by various European and Middle Eastern Patient Groups and Baby Muriel, took place on October 1, 2004,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.elpa-info.org/index.php/general-news---reader/items/id-500-million-people-await-world-health-assembly-decision-on-viral-hepatitis.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However many patient groups continued to mark 'hepatitis day' on disparate dates.&lt;ref name="url"&gt;{{cite press release|title=World Hepatitis Alliance Calls on Governments to Take Urgent Action to Tackle Chronic Viral Hepatitis B &amp; C Epidemic; 2008|url=http://www.aminumber12.org/Content/PDF/news_0004.pdf|work=World Hepatitis Day: Home Page|publisher=World Hepatitis Alliance|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason in 2008, the World Hepatitis Alliance in collaboration with patient groups declared May 19 the first global World Hepatitis Day.

Following the adoption of a resolution during the 63rd [[World Health Assembly]] in May 2010, World Hepatitis Day was given global endorsement as the primary focus for national and international awareness-raising efforts and the date was changed to July 28 (in honour of Nobel Laureate [[Baruch Samuel Blumberg]], discoverer of the hepatitis B virus, who celebrates his birthday on that date). The resolution resolves that "28 July shall be designated as World Hepatitis Day in order to provide an [[right to education|opportunity for education]] and greater understanding of [[viral hepatitis]] as a global public health problem, and to stimulate the strengthening of preventive and control measures of this disease in Member States."

World Hepatitis Day is now recognised in over 100 countries each year through events such as free screenings, poster campaigns, demonstrations, concerts, talk shows, flash mobs and vaccination drives, amongst many others.&lt;ref&gt;World Hepatitis Alliance, [http://www.worldhepatitisalliance.org/en/world-hepatitis-day-2012.html ''World Hepatitis Day Wrap-Up Report 2012''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Each year a report is published by the WHO and the World Hepatitis Alliance detailing all the events across the world.

==Themes==

World Hepatitis Day provides an opportunity to focus on actions such as:&lt;ref name=WHOcampaign/&gt;
*Raising awareness of the different forms of hepatitis and how they are transmitted; 
*Strengthening prevention, screening and control of viral hepatitis and its related diseases;
*Increasing hepatitis B vaccine coverage and integration into national immunization programmes; and
