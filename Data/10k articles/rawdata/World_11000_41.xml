[[File:Abbaye de Bellocq (cheese).jpg|thumb|Abbaye de Belloc Cheese]]
'''Abbaye de Belloc''' is a [[France|French]] Pyrenees, traditional farmhouse, semi-hard [[cheese]] from the [[Northern Basque Country|Pays Basque]] region, made from unpasteurized [[sheep milk]], with a fat content of 60%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belloc-urt.org/ Abbaye de Belloc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505192022/http://www.belloc-urt.org/ |date=May 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cheese is still made in the traditional manner by the [[Benedictine]] monks of the [[Belloc Abbey|Abbaye Notre-Dame de Belloc]], in the [[Communes of France|commune]] of [[Belloc]] in the [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]] [[Departments of France|department]] of southwestern [[France]]. Production of this [[Ossau-Iraty]] cheese is regulated by [[Appellation d'origine contrôlée|A.O.C.]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheese.about.com/od/frenchcheeses/p/abbayedebelloc.htm|title=Cheese of France: Abbaye de Belloc|website=[[About.com]]|first=Jennifer|last=Meier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbaye is produced from the milk of a centuries-old breed of red-nosed [[Manech]] ewes, particular to the Basque region, delivered by farms neighboring Belloc Abbey. It is believed that these Benedictine monks were the first to teach shepherds from the Basque region how to make cheese many centuries ago. Abbaye de Belloc has a pleasantly nutty and complex flavor that is characteristic of Basque,&lt;ref name=pinot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheese.about.com/od/cheeseandwine/tp/pinotnoir.htm|title=Pairing Wine and Cheese: Pairing Cheese with Pinot Noir|website=[[About.com]]|first=Jennifer|last=Meier}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is made in a 5&amp;nbsp;kg fat wheel with a natural, crusty, brownish colored rind with patches of red, orange and yellow. This semi-firm cheese has a dense, rich and creamy texture and a distinctive [[lanolin]] aroma. Careful attention under the correct maturing conditions accentuates this cheese's rich, caramelized flavors, which sometime resemble burnt [[caramel]], that can make Abbaye de Belloc so addictive. It pairs particularly well with Pinot Noir, as it is mild enough not to overwhelm the subtleties of this delicate varietal, but also has sufficient complexity to stand up to the bolder flavors of a Syrah/Shiraz.&lt;ref name=pinot/&gt;

'''Andorra''''s entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]] was chosen in an internal selection by national broadcaster [[Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra|RTVA]]. From over 44 candidates, the selectors chose [[Jenny (singer)|Jenny]], with the song "[[Sense tu]]" (Without you), which they described as similar to the music of artists such as [[Sam Brown (singer)|Sam Brown]] and [[Anastacia]].

Jenny was born in [[Asturias]], [[Spain]], and was a student of music under [[Helen Rowson]] in [[Barcelona]]. She was a new artist in both [[Spain]] and Andorra, with no previous commercial success in either country. The [[record producer|producer]] of this, as well as the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005 entry]], was [[Rafael Artesero]].

Not having advanced to the final in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]], Andorra had to compete in the semifinal in 2006 as well. As both previous Andorran entries, it fared quite poorly. Jenny failed to qualify to the final as well, finishing last of the 23 semifinal contestants.

The '''Banco de Portugal''' ([[English language|English]]: ''Bank of Portugal'') is the [[central bank]] of the [[Portugal|Portuguese Republic]].

==History==
Established by a royal charter on 19 November 1846 to act as a commercial bank and issuing bank, it came about as the result of a merger of the Banco de Lisboa and the Companhia de Confiança Nacional, an investment company specialised in the financing of the public debt.  The bank issues [[legal tender]] that is designated as the national currency – the [[Portuguese real|real]] until 1911, the [[Portuguese escudo|escudo]] from 1911 until 1998, and the euro since 1999.
:
Following its nationalisation in September 1974 and its new Organic Law (1975), the Banco de Portugal was, for the first time, responsible for the supervision of the banking system.

It is an integral part of the [[European System of Central Banks]], which was founded in June 1998.

The current governor is [[Carlos Costa (banker)|Carlos Costa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centralbanking.com/central-banking/news/1685670/carlos-costa-replaces-const-ncio-head-bank-portugal Central Banking: Carlos Costa replaces Constâncio at head of Bank of Portugal] retrieved June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the bank announced that it would pay €359 million in dividends, referring to the year of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/empresas/detalhe/lucros_do_banco_de_portugal_disparam_para_449_milhoes_em_2012.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the bank announced that it would pay €202 million in dividends, referring to the year of 2013, representing a steep decline in comparison to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://expresso.sapo.pt/banco-de-portugal-vai-dar-202-milhoes-em-dividendos-ao-estado=f868678&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Banco de Portugal announced it was restructuring Portugal's second biggest bank, [[Banco Espirito Santo]], by splitting the bank in two.  During the bank restructure, one of the lenders, Oak Finance, had its loan liabilities remain with [[Banco Espirito Santo]]. This triggered a lawsuit from a group of investors including: hedge funds and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Bronze of Levante''' ({{Lang-es|Bronce de Levante}}) is the name of the [[Iberians|proto-Iberian]] culture extending approximately over the [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Region of Valencia]] ([[Spanish Levante]]) in the 2nd millennium BCE. It is contemporary with the [[El Argar]] culture by which it is strongly influenced.

Between c. 1500 and 1300 BCE, the people of this culture colonized [[La Mancha]] with military constructions called ''[[Motillas]]''.

'''Childless Hundred Days''' (百日无孩) is a campaign of mass forced [[abortion]] in [[Shen County]] and [[Guan County, Shandong|Guan County]] in [[Shandong]], China. The campaign started in [[1 May]], [[1991]] and ended in [[10 August]], [[1991]]. It was designed to reduce local population growth, under the national [[One-child policy]]. The campaign was initiated by the local [[Party Committee Secretary]] Zeng Zhaoqi (曾昭起) and Bai Zhigang (白志刚). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=新中国旧故事：山东的百日无孩运动|url=http://www.sohu.com/a/111413012_119977}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the campaign, local officials were asked to perform forced abortion on any pregnant woman in these areas regardless of pregnancy terms or whether the unborn child is the first child of the family. The policy led to mass panic and dramatic reduction of local population in 1991. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=计生委前司长：中国妇女为计生牺牲很大 政府应予回报|url=http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/detail_2012_06/14/15293074_0.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Communal Democracy Party''' ({{lang-tr|Toplumcu Demokrasi Partisi}}, '''TDP''') is a [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[political party]] in the [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="Mirbagheri2009"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Farid Mirbagheri|title=Historical Dictionary of Cyprus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f82Jn_H4VukC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6298-2|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party came into being in May 2007 as a merger of the [[Peace and Democracy Movement]] with the [[Communal Liberation Party]].&lt;ref name="Mirbagheri2009"/&gt; At the 2009 [[legislative]] [[Northern Cyprus parliamentary election, 2009|elections]] for the [[Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus)|Assembly of the Republic]] in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, the TDP, in its first elections, won 2 out of 50 seats and 6.87% of the popular vote. In 2013, it took part in the interim [[Siber cabinet]] with three ministers. At the 2013 legislative [[Northern Cyprus parliamentary election, 2013|elections]], the party increased its share of the vote to 7.41% and its number of MPs to 3. The TDP currently holds the mayorship of the [[Nicosia Turkish Municipality]] with [[Mehmet Harmancı]].

In November 2016, MP Mehmet Çakıcı, the founder of the party and its leader until 2013, resigned from the party, as did former MP Mustafa Emiroğulları and 70 other members including the former Minister of Agriculture Sami Dayıoğlu. Many of these members had originated from the Communal Liberation Party and they criticised what they saw as the nepotism by Cemal Özyiğit. They went on to form a [[Communal Liberation Party (2016)|new party under the same name]] as their political origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TDP'den 70 yeni istifa… Çakıcı: "Tabandan gelen bu fırtına yalnızca bir başlangıç"|url=http://www.kibrispostasi.com/print.php?news=206799|publisher=Kıbrıs Postası|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2015 Turkish Cypriot presidential campaign ==
On 13 March 2015, [[Mustafa Akıncı]], a former member of the parliament from the party, completed his application to run for presidency, and was endorsed by the Communal Democracy Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Akıncı adaylık başvurusunu saat 09.00’da yapacak|url = http://www.gundemkibris.com/akinci-adaylik-basvurusunu-saat-09-00da-yapacak-108713h.htm|accessdate = 2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his campaign, he put his voice forward regarding the ghost town Varosha, which is a very lively topic regarding the Cyprus problem. It was possible to see that Akıncı favoured a settling approach to solve this problem. Regarding Varosha, Akıncı stated that, "Instead of living side by side a corpse let Varosha become a lively city where people live, contractors from both communities do business together and young people can find jobs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Akýncý: "Let Varosha become a lively town"|url = http://www.kpdailynews.com/index.php/cat/35/news/3094/PageName/CYPRUS_LOCAL_NEWS|accessdate = 2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akıncı went on to the second round by receiving 26.94% of the votes in the first round, and was elected president in the second round with 60.5% of the votes.

The TDP became a consultative member of the [[Socialist International]] in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/councils.cfm|title=Socialist International - Progressive Politics For A Fairer World|last=|first=|date=|website=www.socialistinternational.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was upgraded to full membership in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=2498|title=Socialist International - Progressive Politics For A Fairer World|website=www.socialistinternational.org|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:D Napier &amp; Son Acton - Napier Sabre - 1943 advertisement.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A 1944 advertisement for the [[Napier Sabre]] aero-engine]] --&gt;

'''D. Napier &amp; Son Limited''' was a British engineering company best known for its luxury motor cars in the [[Edwardian era]] and for its [[aero engine]]s throughout the early to mid-20th century.

Napier was founded as a precision engineering company in 1808 and for nearly a century produced machinery for the financial, print and munitions industries. In the early 20th century it moved for a time into internal combustion engines and road vehicles before turning to aero engines. Its powerful [[Napier Lion|Lion]] dominated the UK market in the 1920s and the Second World War era [[Napier Sabre|Sabre]] produced 3500&amp;nbsp;hp (2,600&amp;nbsp;kW) in its later versions. Many world speed records on land and water, as well as the [[Hawker Typhoon]] and [[Hawker Tempest|Tempest]] fighter planes, were powered by Napier engines. During the Second World War the company was taken over by [[English Electric]], and engine manufacture eventually ceased. Today, Napier Turbochargers is a subsidiary of the American company [[Wabtec]].

==Early years and precision engineering==

[[David Napier (precision engineer)|David Napier]], second son of the [[blacksmith]] to the [[Duke of Argyll]], was born in 1785. While cousins became [[shipbuilder]]s, he took engineering training in [[Scotland]] before coming to London. There in 1808 he founded the firm that was to become D. Napier &amp; Son in [[Lloyds Court]], [[St Giles, London]].&lt;ref name="W&amp;R"&gt;Wilson &amp; Reader (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a [[steam]]-powered [[printing press]], some of which went to [[Hansard]] (the printer and publisher of proceedings of the [[Houses of Parliament]]), as well as newspapers. The company moved to [[Lambeth]], South London in 1830.

Between 1840 and 1860, Napier was prosperous, with a well-outfitted factory and between 200 and 300 workers. Napier made a wide variety of products, including a [[centrifuge]] for sugar manufacturing, lathes and drills, [[ammunition]]-making equipment for the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]], and railway cranes.&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1483" &gt;[[#Hull (1974)|Hull (1974)]], p.&amp;nbsp;1438&lt;/ref&gt; David's younger son [[James Murdoch Napier (engineer)|James Murdoch]], born 1823, joined the firm in 1837 and became a partner in 1847, resulting in a change in the private company's name to D. Napier &amp; Son.&lt;ref name="W&amp;R" /&gt;

James succeeded his father as head of the firm in 1867, and after his father's death in 1873, specialised in beautifully crafted precision machinery for making [[coin]]s, printing stamps and banknotes. James proved an excellent engineer, but a poor businessman, considering salesmanship undignified. It became so bad that there were as few as seven employees in 1895, and James attempted to sell the business, but failed.&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1483" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1484" &gt;[[#Hull (1974)|Hull (1974)]], p.&amp;nbsp;1484&lt;/ref&gt;

==Montague Napier and high-performance vehicles==
James' son [[Montague Napier|Montague]], born 1870,&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1483" /&gt; inherited the business in 1895, along with his father's engineering talents.&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1483" /&gt; Montague was a hobby [[bicycle racing|racing cyclist]], and at the Bath Road Club, he met "ebullient Australian" [[Selwyn Edge|S. F. Edge]] (then a manager at [[Dunlop Rubber]] and colleague of [[Harry John Lawson|H. J. Lawson]] in London, and amateur racer of [[motorcycle|motor tricycle]]s.) Edge persuaded Napier to improve his [[Panhard]] ("Old Number 8", which had won the [[1896 Paris–Marseille–Paris]]), converting  from a [[tiller]] to a [[steering wheel]] and improving the [[lubrication|oiling]].&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1484" /&gt;

Dissatisfied, Napier offered to fit an engine of his own design, an 8 [[tax horsepower|hp]]&lt;!--tax horsepower does not convert to other units --&gt; [[Straight-twin engine|vertical twin]], with [[sparkplug|electric ignition]], superior to the Panhard's hot tube type.&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1485" &gt;[[#Hull (1974)|Hull (1974)]], p.&amp;nbsp;1485&lt;/ref&gt; Edge was sufficiently impressed to encourage Napier to make his own car and collaborated with [[Harvey du Cros]], his former boss at Dunlop, to form the [[Motor Power Company]], based in London,&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1485" /&gt; which agreed to buy Napier's entire output. The first of an initial order of six, three each two-cylinder 8hp and four-cylinder 16hp, all with aluminium bodies by [[Arthur Mulliner]] of [[Northampton]] and [[chain drive]], was delivered 31 March 1900; Edge paid [[pound Sterling|£]]400 and sold at £500.

In 1903 the manufacturing business moved from Lambeth to larger premises in [[Acton, London|Acton]] and in 1906 it became a limited liability company, D. Napier &amp; Son Limited, although it remained in effect a private company for the next few years.

Outside the racing program, Napier also gained fame in 1904 by being the first car to cross the [[Canadian Rockies]]: Mr and Mrs [[Charles Glidden]], sponsors of the [[Glidden Tour]]s, covered {{convert|3,536|mi|km}} from Boston to [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racing===
Recognising the value of publicity gained from [[auto racing|racing]], which no other British marque did,&lt;ref name="Wise589"&gt;Wise (1974) p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; in spring, Edge entered an 8&amp;nbsp;hp (6&amp;nbsp;kW) Napier in the Thousand Miles (1,600&amp;nbsp;km) [[Classic Trials|Trial]] of the [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club]] on behalf of [[Mary Eliza Kennard]]; driven by Edge, with Kennard along, on a circuit from Newbury to Edinburgh and back, it won its class, being one of only thirty-five finishers (of sixty-four starters&lt;ref&gt;Wise (1974) {{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and one of just twelve to average the requisite 12&amp;nbsp;mph (19&amp;nbsp;km/h) in England and 10&amp;nbsp;mph (16&amp;nbsp;km/h) in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Wise (1974) p. 1486.&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 1900, eight "16 hp"s had been ordered, and Edge entered one in the 837&amp;nbsp;mi (1,350&amp;nbsp;km) Paris-[[Toulouse]]-Paris race, with Rt. Hon. [[Charles Rolls|Charles S. Rolls]] (co-founder of Rolls-Royce) as [[riding mechanic]]. The 301.6 cu in (4.94 L) (101.6×152.4&amp;nbsp;mm, 4x6 in) [[sidevalve]] suffered problems with its ignition coils and cooling system, and failed to finish.&lt;ref&gt;Wise (1974) {{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1901, Montague designed a car sure not to lack speed, having a 16.3-litre (995.5 cu in) (165.1×190.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 6.5×7.5 in) sidevalve four capable of {{convert|103|bhp|abbr=on}} at 800 rpm, on a wheelbase of 115&amp;nbsp;inches (2.921&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;ref name="Wise"&gt;Wise (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; with four-speed [[gearbox]] and chain drive. Called the "50 hp", only two or three were completed, including one for Rolls.&lt;ref name="Wise"/&gt; Edge entered one in the 1901 [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing|Gordon Bennett Cup]], only able to test it ''en route'' (it was completed 25 May, only four days before the event), Montague serving as his riding mechanic; it overpowered its Dunlops, and fitting new (French) tyres led to disqualification, since they were not of the same nation of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Wise (1974) pp. 1486–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In the concurrent [[Paris-Bordeaux rally]], it retired with clutch trouble.&lt;ref&gt;Hull (1974), p. 1487.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[1902 Gordon Bennett Cup|1902 Gordon Bennett]], three entrants (the Charron-Girardot-Voigt, a [[Mors (automobile)|Mors]] and a [[Panhard]]) contested for France, with Edge in a Napier and two Wolseleys. The Napier was a three-speed, shaft-drive 6.44-litre (392.7 cu in) four (127×127&amp;nbsp;mm, 5x5 in) of 44.5&amp;nbsp;hp (33&amp;nbsp;kW) (though described as a 30&amp;nbsp;hp). Piloted by Edge and his cousin, Cecil, it wore what would become known as [[British racing green]], and won at an average 31.8&amp;nbsp;mph (51.2&amp;nbsp;km/h); although by default, since all other entrants retired during the race. It was the first British victory in international motorsport, and would not be repeated until [[Henry Segrave]] took the [[French Grand Prix]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="Wise"/&gt;

[[File:Glidden in London.jpg|thumb|[[Charles J. Glidden]] on his world tour of 1902]]
Napiers also inspired [[Charles J. Glidden]] to create the [[Glidden Tours]] in upstate [[New York state|New York]], which in turn persuaded Napier to build a factory in Boston. It, along with the [[Genoa]] factory (managed by [[Arthur McDonald]]), which built Napiers under licence as San Giorgios from 1906–9, was not a success.&lt;ref&gt;Wise (1974), p.1488.&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual production reached 250 cars in 1903, overwhelming the Lambeth factory, so a move was made to a new {{convert|3.75|acre|ha|adj=on|lk=out}} plant at [[Acton, London|Acton]], in west London. On 16 October of that year, Napier announced a six-cylinder car for 1904 and became the first manufacturer to make a commercially successful six, a "remarkably smooth and flexible" vehicle&lt;ref name="Wise"/&gt; 18&amp;nbsp;hp 301 cu in (4.9-litre) (101.6×101.6&amp;nbsp;mm, 4×4 in) with a three-speed gearbox and chain drive.&lt;ref name="Wise"/&gt; Within five years, there were 62 makers of six-cylinder cars in Britain alone, including the [[Ford Motor Company]]'s 1906 [[Ford Model K|Model K]].&lt;ref&gt;[[G. N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886–1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1904 Six Cylinder Napier Race Car.jpg|thumb|right|1904 Napier 6-cylinder race car]]
Napier's 1902 win brought the Gordon Bennett hosting duties to the United Kingdom, and the 1903 event was held south of [[Dublin]], with three shaft-driven Napiers defending the British and Irish honour, all in the (later famous) racing green: two 470 cubic inch (7708&amp;nbsp;cc) 45&amp;nbsp;horsepower (33.5&amp;nbsp;kW) fours for [[Charles Jarrott (racing driver)|Charles Jarrott]] and [[J. W. Stocks]], with McDonald, the Genoa plant manager, his riding mechanic, and an 80&amp;nbsp;horsepower (838 cubic inch, 13,726&amp;nbsp;cc), the Type K5, for Edge. Jarrott and Stocks crashed, and Edge was disqualified.&lt;ref name="Hull 1974"&gt;Hull (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; It was a bad year for Napier's racing program; a 35&amp;nbsp;hp in the hands of Colonel [[Mark Mayhew]] in the [[Paris-Madrid rally]] lost its steering and hit a tree. Edge, again with McDonald, fared no better with the K5 in the 1904 Gordon Bennett in Germany, but a new 920 cubic inch (15-litre; 158.7×127&amp;nbsp;mm, 6.25×5 inch) six, the L48, with an external radiator reminiscent of the [[Cord 810]], set the fastest time at the Velvet Strand speed trials at [[Portmarnock, Ireland|Portmarnock]], Ireland, in September, piloted by McDonald.&lt;ref&gt;Wise (1974) p. 1,489&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1905, the L48, again with McDonald in the seat, took the mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) record at [[Daytona Beach|Ormonde Beach]] at 104.65&amp;nbsp;mph (168.41&amp;nbsp;km/h); although this was shortly broken by Bowden's [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]], the run was disallowed. The versatile McDonald ran the L48 in the 1905 Gordon Bennett qualifying event at the [[Isle of Man]], taken over for the race by works driver [[Clifford Earp]], who placed ninth.

Edge's secretary, [[Dorothy Levitt]], drove a 100&amp;nbsp;hp (74.6&amp;nbsp;kW) development of the K5 at the [[Blackpool Speed Trials|Blackpool]] and [[Brighton Speed Trials]] in 1905, and the next year ran the L48 at the Blackpool Speed Trials, showing talent by equalling Edge's speed and setting a women's record in the [[flying kilometre]] of 90.88&amp;nbsp;mph (146.25&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name="Wise"/&gt;

By 1907, 1200&amp;nbsp;people were employed by Napier and were making about a hundred cars a year, aided by continuing racing success. [[Brooklands]] opened that year, where Napier engineer [[H. C. Tryon]] won the first ever event in a {{convert|40|hp|abbr=on}}, and Edge made a famous 24-hour run in June, covering 1,581&amp;nbsp;miles (2,544&amp;nbsp;km) at an average 65.905&amp;nbsp;mph (106.06&amp;nbsp;km/h) in a 60&amp;nbsp;horsepower 589 cubic inch (9,652&amp;nbsp;cc) (127×127&amp;nbsp;mm, 5×5 inch) six, a record which stood for 18&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Hull (1974), p. 1,489.&lt;/ref&gt; The L48, nicknamed ''Samson'', became famous there in the venue's first two years; in 1908, Napier's [[Frank Newton (racing driver)|Frank Newton]] covered half a mile (800&amp;nbsp;m) at 119.34&amp;nbsp;mph (190.05&amp;nbsp;km/h) in a stroked (178&amp;nbsp;mm, 7 inch) L48.&lt;ref name="Hull 1974"/&gt;

The company's last race win was with a four-cylinder at the 1908 [[RAC Tourist Trophy|Tourist Trophy]], using an alias, Hutton, to preserve the reputation of the sixes, in the hands of [[William Watson (motoring pioneer)|Willy Watson]].&lt;ref&gt;Hull (1974), p. 1490.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[French Grand Prix]], officials showed the perverse reasoning for which they later became notorious by claiming that removable wire wheels were an unfair advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Wise (1974) p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Napier was no longer in racing, its Lion aero engine was used by several [[:Category:Vehicles powered by Napier Lion engines|land speed record contestant]]s: [[Malcolm Campbell]]'s [[Napier-Campbell Blue Bird]] of 1927 and [[Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird]] of 1931, Segrave's [[Golden Arrow (car)|''Golden Arrow'']] of 1929, and [[John Cobb (motorist)|John Cobb]]'s [[Napier-Railton]] and [[Railton Special|Railton Mobil Special]], which held the record from 1939–64.

===Motor yachting===
Napier expanded into marine engines and launches. In 1903 a S. F. Edge's Napier launch won the inaugural British International [[Harmsworth Trophy]] for speedboats at [[Cork Harbour]] in Ireland, driven by Dorothy Levitt. She achieved {{convert|19.3|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} steel-hulled, speedboat fitted with a 3-blade propeller. As both the owner and entrant of the boat, "S. F. Edge" is engraved on the trophy as the winner. The third crew member, Campbell Muir, may also have taken the controls.

On 8 August 1903 Levitt drove the Napier at [[Cowes]] and won the race. She was then commanded to the [[HMY Britannia (Royal Cutter Yacht)|Royal yacht]] by [[King Edward VII]] where he congratulated her on her pluck and skill, and they discussed the performance of the boat and its potential for British government despatch work.&lt;ref name="PIP Nov 1906"&gt;"The Sensational Adventures of Miss Dorothy Levitt, – Champion Lady Motorist of the World", ''[[The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times]]'' (London, England), Saturday, November 17, 1906; p. 309; Issue 2373.[http://forums.autosport.com/index.php?showtopic=106579&amp;st=40&amp;start=40 Autosport, The Nostalgia Forum, Historical Research, Dorothy Levitt – early motoring]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in August Levitt won the ''[[Menier Chocolate|Gaston Menier Cup]]'' at Trouville, France. This was described as the ''five mile world's championship of the sea'' and the prize was  $1,750 prize.&lt;ref name="Chatty p8-9"&gt;''The Woman and the Car – A chatty little handbook for all women who motor or who want to motor'' by Dorothy Levitt. pages 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1903 Levitt won the ''Championship of the Seas'' at Trouville, and the French government bought the boat for £1,000.&lt;ref name="PIP Nov 1906"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatty p8-9"/&gt;

The 1905 boat ''Napier II'' set the world [[water speed record]] for a mile at almost 30 [[knot (unit)|knot]]s (56&amp;nbsp;km/h).

==Public limited company and WWI==
[[File:Napier Lion engine at Science Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Napier Lion]] engine]]
In 1912, following a dispute with Edge, the business was restructured. D. Napier &amp; Son Limited went public and bought out Edge's distribution and sales company, S.F. Edge (1907) Limited. The latter soon went into voluntary liquidation and thus the manufacture and marketing of Napier cars were united under a single organization.&lt;ref name="W&amp;R" /&gt; Production rose to around 700 cars a year with many supplied to the London [[Taxicab|taxi]] trade. That year, only six models were produced. 

On the outbreak of war sales of private vehicles collapsed and Napier turned to military orders. Vehicle production continued for a time on this basis and 2,000 trucks and ambulances were supplied to the [[War Office]]. Montague Napier's health declined and in 1917 he moved to Cannes, France, but continued to take an active involvement in the company until his death in 1931.

Early in the war, Napier was contracted to build engines from other companies' designs: initially the model [[RAF 3]], a V-12 by [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|Royal Aircraft Factory]], and then the V-8 [[Sunbeam Arab]]. Both proved to be rather unreliable, and in 1916 Napier decided to design its own instead, an effort that led to the superb [[W12 engine|W-block]] 12-cylinder [[Napier Lion|Lion]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunston, W.; ''World Encyclopaedia of Aero Engines'', 4th Edn., Patrick Stephens, 1998, p.121; "''The result was the Lion, a masterpiece."''&lt;/ref&gt; The Lion came into service shortly before the end of the war.

During the First World War the company was also contracted to build 600 aircraft at the Acton factory (50 [[Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.7]], 400 [[Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8]] and 150 [[Sopwith Snipe]]s). Together with the engine work, this required enormous expansion of the company.

==Interwar period==
[[File:Napier Type 75 TT 1920.jpg|thumb|1920 Type 75 TT]]
By the end of the war, military production had tailed off and the Lion was still barely in use.

In 1919 civilian car production was recommenced. The T75 motor car would be Napier's last. Designed by [[Arthur Rowledge|A. J. Rowledge]] (who left for [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] in 1921), its engine was a 40-50hp {{convert|377|cuin|cc|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|101.6|×|127|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) [[alloy]] six with detachable [[cylinder head]], [[overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|single overhead camshaft]], seven-[[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] [[crankshaft]], dual [[ignition magneto|magneto]] and [[ignition coil|coil]] ignition, dual plugs, and Napier-[[SU Carburettor]]. Coachwork was by [[Cunard (coachbuilder)|Cunard]], by then a subsidiary.&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1485" /&gt; 187 were built in all by 1924, and Napier quit car production with a total of 4,258 built.&lt;ref name="Hull, Napier, 1485" /&gt; The car was very expensive, costing about the same as a [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost]] and in the early 1920s sales were slow. The last car was sold in 1924.

The Lion was by now becoming a best-seller for the company, which eventually dropped all the other aero-engines. The Lion went on to be adapted for land and water, to set the [[Land Speed Record]] in [[Malcolm Campbell]]'s [[Napier-Campbell Blue Bird]] of 1927 and [[Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird]] 0f 1931 and [[Henry Segrave]]'s ''[[Golden Arrow (car)|Golden Arrow]]'' of 1931 and later in [[John Cobb (racing driver)|John Cobb]]'s [[Napier-Railton]] and [[Railton Mobil Special]], which held the record from 1939–64.

In the 1930s the introduction of much larger and more powerful aero-engines from other companies ended sales of the Lion. Napier quickly started work on newer designs, building on experience gained on the [[X engine|X style]] 16-cylinder, 1,000&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] (746&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Napier Cub|Cub]], used in the [[Blackburn Cubaroo]] single-engined bomber of the 1920s, and the resulting later 16-cylinder [[Napier Rapier|Rapier]] and 24-cylinder [[Napier Dagger|Dagger]] were both air-cooled H-block designs. Neither the Rapier nor the Dagger proved very reliable, due to poor cooling of the rearmost cylinders, and even the Dagger's {{convert|1000|hp|abbr=on}} was less than its competitors' offerings when shipped.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

As Lion sales faded, an attempt was also made to buy the bankrupt [[Bentley Motors Limited|Bentley]] company in 1931 but Napier was outbid at the last minute by Rolls-Royce. The last vehicle project was a three-wheeled tractor-trailer goods vehicle, but rather than produce this itself, the design was sold to [[Scammell]], which made several thousand.

==Second World War==
[[File:Napier Sabre01.jpg|thumb|[[Napier Sabre]] engine]]
Starting from scratch, Napier decided to use the new [[sleeve valve]] design in a much larger [[H engine|H-block]] 24-cylinder engine, soon to be known as the [[Napier Sabre|Sabre]]. Designed under [[Frank Halford]], the engine was very advanced and proved to be difficult to adapt to assembly line production. Therefore, although the engine was ready by 1940, it was not until 1944 that production versions were considered reliable. At that point efforts were made to improve it, leading eventually to the Sabre VII delivering 3,500&amp;nbsp;hp (2,600&amp;nbsp;kW), making it the most powerful engine in the world, from an engine much smaller than its competition.

Napier also worked on [[Aircraft diesel engine|diesel aircraft engines]]. In the 1930s it licensed the [[Junkers Jumo 204]] for production in England, which it called the [[Napier Culverin|Culverin]]. It also planned to produce a smaller version of the same basic design as the [[Napier Cutlass|Cutlass]], but work on both was cancelled at the outbreak of War in 1939.

Napier developed a marine engine from the Lion aero engine, the petrol-driven Sea Lion, which could deliver {{convert|500|hp|abbr=on}} and was used in the [[RAF Rescue Launch|"Whaleback" Air Sea Rescue]] Launches.
[[File:Napier Deltic Engine.jpg|thumb|[[Napier Deltic]] engine, cut away for display]]
During the war (1944) Napier was asked by the [[Royal Navy]] to supply a diesel engine for use in its [[patrol boat]]s, but the Culverin's 720&amp;nbsp;hp (537&amp;nbsp;kW) was not nearly enough for its needs. Napier then designed under the leadership of Ernest Edward Chatterton, Chief Engineer, the [[Napier Deltic|Deltic]], essentially three Culverins arranged in a large triangle (deltoid). Considered one of the most complex engine designs of its day, the Deltic was nevertheless very reliable, and was taken into service after the war as a [[locomotive]] powerplant (in [[British Rail]]'s [[British Rail Class 55|Class 55]]) in addition to the [[torpedo boat]]s, [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s and other small naval vessels for which it was designed.

Also during the Second World War a six-cylinder 300 cubic inch road-vehicle engine was commissioned by the government, but this design was sold to [[Leyland Motors]] by 1945.

==Post-war==
===English Electric===
Napier had been taken over by [[English Electric]] on 23 November 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Dan: ''British Secret Projects 5: Britain's Space Shuttle'', Crécy, 2016, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Last of the great Napier internal combustion engines was the [[Napier Nomad|Nomad]], a complicated "turbo-compound" design that combined a diesel engine with a [[turbine]] to recover energy otherwise lost in the exhaust. The advantage of this complex design was fuel economy: it had the best [[specific fuel consumption (shaft engine)|specific fuel consumption]] of any aircraft engine, even to this day. However, even better fuel economy could be had by flying a normal [[jet engine]] at much higher altitudes, while existing designs filled the "low end" of the market fairly well. First run in 1949, the Nomad I underwent radical redesign for the Nomad II but was largely ignored by the market and was cancelled in 1955.

Along with every major aero engine company in the post-war era, Napier turned to the jet turbine. Seeing a niche not yet adopted up by the larger vendors, Napier developed a number of [[turboshaft]] designs which saw some use, notably in [[helicopter]]s. Its first design, the [[Napier Naiad|Naiad]] and Double Naiad was developed for various Royal Navy [[Fleet Air Arm]] projects, but did not enter production. The smaller models developed later, the 3,000-hp-class [[Napier Eland|Eland]] and 1,500-hp-class [[Napier Gazelle|Gazelle]] did somewhat better, notably the Gazelle which powered several models of the popular [[Westland Wessex]] helicopter. Production ceased when a deal was struck with Rolls-Royce in 1961.

At the same time, the [[ramjet]] was showing promise for high-speed supersonic flight. From 1951 Napier developed a successful large-diameter experimental engine, the Napier Ram Jet (NRJ). Napier continued in ramjet development for several years, typically working alongside the English Electric aircraft design team.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Dan; ''British Secret Projects 5: Britain's Space Shuttle'', Cr&amp;eacute;cy, 2016, pp.18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Napier Aero Engines Limited ===
In 1961 a new company ''Napier Aero Engines Limited'' was formed by D. Napier &amp; Son and [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], to take over the Napier aero-engine business and the Acton engine factory.&lt;ref name="nae"&gt;"ENGLISH ELECTRIC-ROLLS ROYCE Napier Aero Engines Ltd." Times [London, England] 1 June 1961: 24. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 30 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It was to continue to market the Gazelle, while the completion of existing Gazelle contracts and the Eland remained the financial responsibility of the old company. But it closed only two years later, in 1963.&lt;ref&gt; [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/mar/08/napier-aero-engines-ltd-closure Napier Aero Engines Ltd (closure)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017100215/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/mar/08/napier-aero-engines-ltd-closure |date=17 October 2016 }} Hansard, 8 March 1963 vol 673 cc921-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the move of the aero engine business, D. Napier &amp; Son continued as a subsidiary of English Electric.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; With the ending of Deltic sales in the 1960s it had no new modern engine designs to offer. Today Napier is no longer in the engine business.

===Napier Turbochargers===
[[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] bought English Electric in the late 1960s. The GEC operation, now part of [[Ruston (engine builder)|Ruston Gas Turbines]], later moved to [[GEC-Alsthom]] and then [[Alstom]], before being sold to [[Siemens]] in March 2003.

''Napier Turbochargers'' was bought from Siemens in June 2008 in a [[management buyout]]. The buyout was funded by the private equity company Primary Capital for around £100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.lloydstsbcorporatemarkets.com/corporateservices/specialistfinancing/levfinance/majordeals/napier.asp |title=Napier|publisher=Lloydscorporatemarkets.com}}{{Dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/2791200/Primary-turbocharged-after-moving-on-Napier.html  |title=Primary turbocharged after moving on Napier|work=The Telegraph |date=6 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 2013 Napier Turbochargers became part of [[Wabtec]]. Napier Turbochargers currently produces turbochargers for the marine, power and rail industries, employing around 150 people.

'''David Andrew Farrow''' (born January 10, 1975) is a two-time Canadian [[Guinness World Record]] Holder for Most Decks of Playing Cards Memorized in a Single Sighting, [[entrepreneur]], memory coach, [[speed reader]] and [[keynote]] speaker. He is best known for winning the Guinness World Records for Most Decks of Playing Cards Memorized in a Single Sighting in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Guinness Book of World Records, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2007&lt;ref&gt;Guinness Book of World Records, 2009 edition&lt;/ref&gt; when he set out to reclaim his record after it was beaten in 2002. The initial record was set at the Guinness World Records museum in [[Niagara Falls]], [[Ontario]], Canada while the latter was performed for [[Discovery Channel Canada]] at [[CTV Television Network]] studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-decks-of-playing-cards-memorized-single-sighting.html|title=Most decks of playing cards memorised in a single sighting|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both records were accomplished under the controlled supervision of multiple cameras and multiple independent witnesses.

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2018}}
Dave Farrow was born on January 10, 1975, in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], to Wayne and Virginia Farrow. Born into a blue-collar family, his father Wayne is a retired factory worker, who dealt in space shuttle parts and his mother Virginia is a homemaker. After resuscitating him twice during birth, doctors offered a bleak prognosis, suggesting Farrow was unlikely to survive past his first year due to the numerous health problems that would plague his infancy and childhood. He was constantly in and out of the hospital during his formative years, which affected his studies and severely impacted his learning.

Despite experiencing this setback, Farrow was able to catch up on schoolwork through independent study. Although he went beyond the curriculum coursework and completed the requirements for the following year, the school refused his request to skip a grade. Farrow eventually got bored and started skipping school. His truancy coupled with his medical issues started to play a toll on his academia and by middle school; he fell behind the learning curve. He was told by one of his teachers that would not amount to anything in life and that he would end up in the blue-collar industry like his father. In addition, Farrow was diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and [[dyslexia]]. The doctors recommended that he be put on a consistent course of [[Ritalin]] but his mother refused. Following this decision, Farrow decided to take matter into his own hands and began exploring [[behavior modification]] approaches to manage his disability. He started going to the library on a frequent basis to expand his knowledge and coming up with memory methods to combat his ADHD and dyslexia through self-taught [[speed reading]] and memorizing. This created the foundation of what was later to be known as The Farrow Method. At the age of 14, Farrow was enrolled into [[Eastwood Collegiate Institute]], a public high school in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. It was there that he started improving his grades dramatically and graduated from high school with perfect distinction and continued on to become a successful businessman.

Farrow has an older sister, Kathy, who was born in September 1973. Growing up, he and his family would go to their family cottage at Biscotasi Lake Provincial Park in [[Biscotasing, Ontario]], on a regular basis for family vacations. The family trips to the outdoors helped build his passion for wilderness survival and hiking.

==Guinness World Records==
[[File:Dave Farrow at CTV Television Network studios in April, 2007.jpg|thumb|Dave Farrow setting his second Guinness World Record for Most Decks of Playing Cards Memorized in a Single Sighting at CTV Television Network studios in April, 2007]]
At the age of 21, Farrow received his first [[Guinness World Record]] for Most Decks of Playing Cards Memorized in a Single Sighting in 1996 where he memorized the order of 52 decks of [[playing cards]], randomly shuffled together, and recalled them correctly under Guinness Record rules (a total of 2704 cards) in a single sighting.&lt;ref&gt;Guinness Book of World Records, 1997 edition&lt;/ref&gt; This feat was accomplished at the Guinness World Records museum in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]] and is featured in the Guinness Book of World Records, 1997 edition. Years later in 2002, [[Dominic O'Brien]] broke his record by memorizing 54 decks of cards. By this time, Farrow was able to easily break the record again in 2007.

He memorized on single sighting, a random sequence of 59 separate packs of cards (3,068 cards), which took around 14 hours to memorize.  Farrow later recalled these cards at CTV Studios, ''[[Daily Planet (TV series)|Daily Planet]]'' in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, on April 2, 2007, and the recall took approximately 9 hours. While undertaking this feat, Farrow made just one mistake during the entire attempt, which he corrected without any external assistance. This successful record is currently featured in the Guinness Book of World Records, 2009 edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-decks-of-playing-cards-memorized-single-sighting.html|title=Most decks of playing cards memorised in a single sighting|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains unbroken to this day. What makes this record challenging is that participants can only see each card once with zero repetition and they are only allowed 0.5% errors while many other records allow a much high error rate. Therefore, this record is currently considered the most difficult memory feat for volume and accuracy of memory.

==Sony Reader Revolution==
In October 2008, [[Sony Corporation]] invited Farrow to participate in a publicity campaign for their just announced PRS-700 [[Sony Reader]]. As part of their Reader Revolution campaign, Farrow lived in the DataVision store window on [[Fifth Avenue]], New York City for 30 days. The Reader Revolution campaign was an effort to promote the newest version of the Sony Reader and to increase the engagement of the general public in digital reading. Sony promised that for each page Farrow read, Sony would give a set of 100 [[E-book]] classics to an education institution. The goal was to eventually give 15 million E-book titles to various schools by the end of the program. The first 100 schools to start downloading their selected classic titles will also receive and education pack of five Reader Digitial Books. During the campaign, Farrow read a total of 44,097 pages, which translates to 102 books.

==Career==
After gaining international attention for his 1996 Guinness World Record accomplishment, Farrow continued to utilize his own memory techniques and skills to educate himself in the field of [[nanotechnology]]. His passion in nanotechnology led him to speaking at conferences across North America, in front of the research division of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] and to members of the [[White House]] Task Force, as well as being featured in a nanotechnology trade magazine. Building on this success, Farrow founded the nanotechnology company, Accella Scientific Inc. In 2003 where he was involved in a U.S. patent filing for a reliable hand-held [[HIV]] diagnostics device that he hopes to bring to market and change the way HIV is tested in [[developing countries]]. In 2010, Farrow founded Farrow Inc., which {{as of|2015|lc=y}} has subsidiaries Farrow Memory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davefarrow.com|title=Farrow Memory|publisher=Dave Farrow|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; FarrowPR &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farrowpr.com|title=FarrowPR|publisher=Dave Farrow|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Farrowbot.

FarrowPR, a public relations firm based in [[Buffalo, New York]], was founded in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farrowpr.com|title=FarrowPR|publisher=Dave Farrow|accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers speaker services, sales training, media coaching, corporate and individual branding, social media and digital marketing, media and public relations services, and event management.

'''''Die Son''''' ([[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]: "The Sun") is an Afrikaans-language [[South Africa]]n [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] reporting sensational [[news]] essentially after the model of [[British tabloid]]s. It is the South African [[newspaper]] with the largest increase in readership in recent years. In the [[Western Cape]] province, it appears as a daily; in other provinces, it is a weekly paper. The editorial seat is in [[Cape Town]]. 

The publishing house [[Naspers]] began to publish ''Die Son'' in 2003, after the large success of the [[English language|English-language]] tabloid ''The Daily Sun'' in Western Cape, first under the title ''Kaapse Son'' ("Cape Sun"). The sales figures rose so rapidly that they decided in the same year to expand the sales to the whole of South Africa. In the first half-year (2005) the print run of the daily paper was estimated at 50&amp;nbsp;000; that on Fridays for the whole of South Africa averaged 220&amp;nbsp;000 copies. The other Afrikaans-language dailies (also from Naspers), like ''[[Die Burger]]'', did not suffer from the dramatic growth of ''Die Son''.

The English-language edition and the Afrikaans edition share most of the content (both news and [[advertisement]]), except minor differences such as that the English does not have the ''[[Page 3]]'' girl feature. The current, and founding, national editor is [[Ingo Capraro]], previously of ''Die Burger'', another Naspers publication.

'''Digital Access Signalling System 1''' ('''DASS1''') is a [[proprietary protocol]] defined by [[British Telecom]] to provide [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] services in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is now obsolete, having been replaced by [[DASS2]]. This too will become obsolete over the coming years as [[Q.931]], a [[Europe]]an standard, becomes widely adopted in the [[European Union|EU]].

'''Donald Malcolm Campbell''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (23 March 1921{{snd}}4 January 1967) was a British speed record breaker who broke eight absolute world speed records on water and on land in the 1950s and 1960s. He remains the only person to set both [[Land speed record|world land]] and [[water speed record]]s in the same year (1964). He died during a water speed record attempt at [[Coniston Water]] in the [[Lake District]], England.

==Family and personal life==

Campbell, mmn = Whittall&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell attended [[St Peter's School, Seaford]] and [[Uppingham School]]. At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] he volunteered for the [[Royal Air Force]], but was unable to serve because of a case of childhood rheumatic fever. He joined Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd in [[West Thurrock]], where he became a maintenance engineer. Subsequently, he was a shareholder in a small engineering company called Kine engineering, producing machine tools. Following his father's death on New Year's Eve, 31 December 1948 and aided by Malcolm's chief engineer, [[Leo Villa]], the younger Campbell strove to set speed records first on [[Water speed record|water]] and then [[Land Speed Record|land]].

He married three times: to Daphne Harvey in 1945, producing daughter Georgina (Gina) Campbell, born on 19 September 1946; to Dorothy McKegg in 1952; and to Tonia Bern in December 1958, which lasted until his death in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racingcampbells.com/content/donald.asp |title=Donald &amp; Malcolm Campbell - Donald |publisher=The Racing Campbells |date= |accessdate=26 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003155431/http://www.racingcampbells.com/content/donald.asp |archivedate=3 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell was intensely superstitious, hating the colour green, the number thirteen and believing nothing good ever happened on a Friday. He also had some interest in the [[paranormal]], which he nurtured as a member of [[the Ghost Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghostclub.org.uk/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301204630/http://www.ghostclub.org.uk/history.htm |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }} - "A Brief History" section&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell was a restless man and seemed driven to emulate, if not surpass, his father's achievements.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He was generally light-hearted and was generally, at least until his 1960 crash at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], optimistic in his outlook.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Behind the public façade of speed king, he was a complex character&amp;nbsp;— proud and vulnerable, increasingly anxious about his place in the world. Campbell was a great [[patriotism|patriot]] and saw his achievements as being for the greater good of Britain.&lt;ref name="tremayne"&gt;Donald Campbell: The Man Behind The Mask, David Tremayne, Bantam Press, London, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water speed records==

[[File:Bluebird K7 in 1960 at Goodwood.jpg|thumb|left| Bluebird K7 on display at Goodwood Motor Racing circuit in 1960.]]

Campbell began his speed record attempts in the summer of 1949, using his father's old boat, ''[[Blue Bird K4]]'', which he renamed Bluebird K4. His initial attempts that summer were unsuccessful, although he did come close to raising his father's existing record. The team returned to [[Coniston Water]], [[Furness|Lancashire]]&lt;!--Do not change to Cumbria, it did not exist prior to 1974--&gt; in 1950 for further trials. While there, they heard that an American, [[Stanley Sayres]], had raised the record from {{convert|141|to|160|mph|abbr=on}}, beyond K4's capabilities without substantial modification.

Over the winter of 1950 to 1951, Bluebird K4 was modified to make it a 'prop-rider' as opposed to her original immersed propeller configuration. This greatly reduced hydrodynamic drag as the third planing point would now be the propeller hub, meaning one of the two propeller blades was always out of the water at high speed. She now sported two cockpits, the second one being for Leo Villa.

Bluebird K4 now had a chance of exceeding Sayers' record and also enjoyed success as a circuit racer, winning the Oltranza Cup in [[Italy]] in the spring of that year. Returning to Coniston in September, they finally got Bluebird up to 170&amp;nbsp;mph after further trials, only to suffer a structural failure at {{convert|170|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} which wrecked the boat. Sayers raised the record the following year to {{convert|178|mph|abbr=on}} in Slo-Mo-Shun IV.

Along with Campbell, Britain had another potential contender for Water Speed Record honours - [[John Cobb (motorist)|John Cobb]]. He had commissioned the world's first purpose-built turbojet [[Hydroplane (boat)|Hydroplane]], ''[[Crusader (speedboat)|Crusader]]'', with a target speed of over {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}, and began trials on [[Loch Ness]] in autumn 1952. Cobb was killed later that year, when Crusader broke up, during an attempt on the record. Campbell was devastated at Cobb's loss, but he resolved to build a new Bluebird boat to bring the WSR back to Britain.

In early 1953, Campbell began development of his own advanced all-metal jet-powered ''[[Bluebird K7]]'' hydroplane to challenge the record, by now held by the American prop rider hydroplane Slo-Mo-Shun IV.[1] Designed by Ken and Lew Norris, the K7 was a steel framed, aluminium bodied, three-point hydroplane with a Metropolitan-Vickers Beryl axial-flow turbojet engine, producing 3,500 pound-force (16&amp;nbsp;kN) of thrust.

Like Slo-Mo-Shun, but unlike Cobb's tricycle Crusader, the three planing points were arranged with two forward, on outrigged sponsons and one aft, in a "pickle-fork" layout, prompting Bluebird's early comparison to a blue lobster. K7 was of very advanced design and construction, and its load bearing steel space frame ultra rigid and stressed to 25g (exceeding contemporary military jet aircraft). It had a design speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h|abbr=off}} and remained the only successful jet-boat in the world until the late 1960s.

The designation "K7" was derived from its Lloyd's unlimited rating registration. It was carried on a prominent white roundel on each sponson, underneath an infinity symbol. Bluebird K7 was the seventh boat registered at Lloyds in the 'Unlimited' series.

Campbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between July 1955 and December 1964. The first of these marks was set at [[Ullswater]] on 23 July 1955, where he achieved a speed of {{convert|202.32|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} but only after many months of trials and a major redesign of Bluebird's forward sponson attachments points. Campbell achieved a steady series of subsequent speed-record increases with the boat during the rest of the decade, beginning with a mark of {{convert|216|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1955 on Lake Mead in Nevada. Subsequently, four new marks were registered on Coniston Water, where Campbell and Bluebird became an annual fixture in the latter half of the '50s, enjoying significant sponsorship from the Mobil oil company and then subsequently BP.

Campbell also made an attempt in 1957 at [[Canandaigua]] in [[New York state]] in the summer of 1957, which failed due to lack of suitable calm water conditions. Bluebird K7 became a well known and popular attraction, and as well as her annual Coniston appearances, K7 was displayed extensively in the UK, USA, Canada and Europe, and then subsequently in Australia during Campbell's prolonged attempt on the land speed record (LSR) in 1963-64.

In order to extract more speed, and endow the boat with greater high speed stability, in both pitch and yaw, K7 was subtly modified in the second half of the 1950s to incorporate more effective streamlining with a blown Perspex cockpit canopy and fluting to the lower part of the main hull. In 1958, a small wedge shaped tail fin, housing an arrester parachute, modified sponson fairings, that gave a significant reduction in forward aerodynamic lift, and a fixed hydrodynamic stabilising fin, attached to the transom to aid directional stability, and exert a marginal down-force on the nose were incorporated into the design to increase the safe operating envelope of the hydroplane. Thus she reached {{convert|225|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1956, where an unprecedented peak speed of {{convert|286.78|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} was achieved on one run, {{convert|239|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1957, {{convert|248|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1958 and {{convert|260|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1959.

Campbell was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in January 1957 for his water speed record breaking, and in particular his record at [[Lake Mead]] in the USA which earned him and Britain very positive acclaim.

==Land speed record attempt==
[[File:1962 Bluebird Campbell CN7.JPG|thumb|left|''Bluebird CN7'' on display at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu|National Motor Museum]] in Beaulieu.]]

It was after the Lake Mead WSR success in 1955 that the seeds of Campbell's ambition to hold the [[Land Speed Record]] as well were planted. The following year, the serious planning was under way - to build a car to break the land speed record, which then stood at {{convert|394|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} set by John Cobb in 1947. The Norris brothers designed ''[[Bluebird-Proteus CN7]]'' with {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} in mind.

The brothers were even more enthusiastic about the car than the boat and like all of his projects, Campbell wanted Bluebird CN7, to be the best of its type, a showcase of British engineering skills. The British motor industry in the guise of [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]], [[BP]], [[Smiths Industries]] and [[Lucas Automotive]],Rubery Owen as well as many others, became heavily involved in the project to build the most advanced car the world had yet seen. CN7 was powered by a specially modified [[Bristol Proteus|Bristol-Siddeley Proteus]] [[Free-turbine turboshaft|free-turbine]] engine of {{convert|4450|shp|abbr=on}} driving all four wheels. Bluebird CN7 was designed to achieve 475–500&amp;nbsp;mph and was completed by the spring of 1960.

Following low-speed tests conducted at the [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] motor racing circuit in [[Sussex]], in July, the ''CN7'' was taken to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in Utah, USA, scene of his father's last LSR triumph, some 25 years earlier in September 1935. The trials initially went well, and various adjustments were made to the car. On the sixth run in CN7, Campbell lost control at over 360&amp;nbsp;mph and crashed. It was the car's tremendous structural integrity that saved his life. He was hospitalised with a fractured skull and a burst eardrum, as well as minor cuts and bruises but ''CN7'' was a write off. Almost immediately, Campbell announced he was determined to have another go. Sir [[Alfred Owen]], whose [[Rubery Owen]] industrial group had built CN7, offered to rebuild it for him. That single decision was to have a profound influence on the rest of Campbell's life. His original plan had been to break the LSR at over 400&amp;nbsp;mph in 1960, return to Bonneville the following year to really bump up the speed to something near to 500&amp;nbsp;mph, get his seventh WSR with K7 and then retire, as undisputed champion of speed and perhaps just as important, secure in the knowledge that he was worthy of his father's legacy.

Campbell decided not to go back to Utah for the new trials. He felt the Bonneville course was too short at {{convert|11|mi|adj=on}} and the salt surface was in poor condition. BP offered to find another venue and eventually after a long search, [[Lake Eyre]], in South Australia, was chosen. It hadn't rained there for nine years and the vast dry bed of the salt lake offered a course of up to {{convert|20|mi|adj=on}}. By the summer of 1962, Bluebird CN7 was rebuilt, some nine months later than Campbell had hoped. It was essentially the same car, but with the addition of a large stabilising tail fin and a reinforced fibreglass cockpit cover. At the end of 1962, CN7 was shipped out to Australia ready for the new attempt. Low-speed runs had just started when the rains came. The course was compromised and further rain meant, that by May 1963, Lake Eyre was flooded to a depth of 3 inches, causing the attempt to be abandoned. Campbell was heavily criticised in the press for alleged time wasting and mismanagement of the project, despite the fact that he could hardly be held responsible for the unprecedented weather.

To make matters worse for Campbell, American [[Craig Breedlove]] drove his pure thrust jet car '[[Spirit of America (automobile)|Spirit of America]]' to a speed of {{convert|407.45|mph}} at Bonneville in July 1963. Although the 'car' did not conform to [[FIA]] (Federation Internationale de L'Automobile) regulations, that stipulated it had to be wheel-driven and have a minimum of four wheels, in the eyes of the world, Breedlove was now the fastest man on earth.

Campbell returned to Australia in March 1964, but the Lake Eyre course failed to fulfil the early promise it had shown in 1962 and there were further spells of rain. BP pulled out as his main sponsor after a dispute, but he was able to secure backing from Australian oil company [[Ampol]].

The track never properly dried out and Campbell was forced to make the best of the conditions. Finally, in July 1964, he was able to post some speeds that approached the record. On the 17th of that month, he took advantage of a break in the weather and made two courageous runs along the shortened and still damp track, posting a new LSR of {{convert|403.10|mph|abbr=on}}. The surreal moment was captured in a number of well-known images by photographers, including Australia's Jeff Carter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/07/on-this-day-world-land-speed-record-broken|title=On this day: World Land Speed Record broken|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Campbell was bitterly disappointed with the record as the vehicle had been designed for much higher speeds. ''CN7'' covered the final third of the measured mile at an average of {{convert|429|mph|abbr=on}}, peaking as it left the measured distance at over {{convert|440|mph|abbr=on}}. He resented the fact that it had all been so difficult. 'We've made it – we got the bastard at last,' was his reaction to the success. Campbell's 403.1&amp;nbsp;mph represented the official Land Speed Record.

In 1969, after Campbell's fatal accident, his widow, Tonia Bern-Campbell negotiated a deal with Lynn Garrison, President of Craig Breedlove and Associates, that would see [[Craig Breedlove]] run Bluebird on Bonneville's Salt Flats. This concept was cancelled when the parallel Spirit of America supersonic car project failed to find support.[[File:Model of Donald Campbell Bluebird used in Breedlove promotion.png|thumb|Model of Donald Campbell Bluebird used in Breedlove promotion]]

==The Double==

Campbell now planned to go after the Water Speed Record one more time with Bluebird K7 - to do what he had aimed for so many years ago, during the initial planning stages of CN7 – break both records in the same year. After more delays, he finally achieved his seventh WSR at [[Lake Dumbleyung]] near [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], on the last day of 1964, at a speed of {{convert|276.33|mph|abbr=on}}. He had become the first, and so far only, person to set both land and water speed records in the same year.

Campbell's LSR was short-lived, because FIA rule changes meant that pure jet cars would be eligible to set records from October 1964. Campbell's {{convert|429|mph|abbr=on}} speed on his final Lake Eyre run remained the highest speed achieved by a wheel-driven car until 2001; ''Bluebird CN7'' is now on display at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu|National Motor Museum]] at Beaulieu in [[Hampshire]], England, its potential only partly realised.

==Rocket car plans and final water speed record attempt==

===Bluebird Mach 1.1===
[[File:Bluebird Mach 1.1 at Priors Ford.tif|thumb|left|Promotional model of Bluebird Mach 1.1 displayed outside Campbell's house in spring 1966.]] Campbell decided a massive jump in speed was called for following his successful 1964 LSR attempt in Bluebird CN7. His vision was of a supersonic rocket car with a potential maximum speed of {{convert|840|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Norris Brothers were requested to undertake a design study. Bluebird Mach 1.1 was a design for a rocket-powered supersonic land speed record car.
Campbell chose a lucky date to hold a press conference at the Charing Cross Hotel on 7 July 1965 to announce his future record breaking plans:

{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | text="...&amp;nbsp;In terms of speed on the Earth's surface, my next logical step must be to construct a Bluebird car that can reach Mach 1.1. The Americans are already making plans for such a vehicle and it would be tragic for the world image of British technology if we did not compete in this great contest and win. The nation whose technologies are first to seize the 'faster than sound' record on land will be the nation whose industry will be seen to leapfrog into the '70s or '80s. We can have the car on the track within three years."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}}}

Bluebird Mach 1.1 was to be rocket-powered. Ken Norris had calculated using rocket motors would result in a vehicle with very low frontal area, greater density, and lighter weight than if he went down the jet engine route. Bluebird Mach 1.1 would also be a relatively compact and simple design. Norris specified two off-the-shelf Bristol Siddeley BS.605 rocket engines. The 605 had been developed as a take-off assist rocket engine for military aircraft and was fuelled with kerosene, using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer. Each engine was rated at {{convert|8,000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust. In Bluebird Mach 1.1 application, the combined {{convert|16,000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust would be equivalent of 36,000&amp;nbsp;bhp (27,000&amp;nbsp;kW; 36,000 PS) at {{convert|840|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

===Final record attempt===

In order to increase publicity for his rocket car venture, in the spring of 1966, Campbell decided to try once more for a water speed record. This time the target was {{convert|300|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Bluebird K7'' was fitted with a lighter and more powerful [[Bristol Orpheus]] engine, taken from a [[Folland Gnat]] jet aircraft, which developed {{convert|4500|lb-f}} of thrust. The modified boat was taken back to Coniston in the first week of November 1966. The trials did not go well. The weather was appalling, and ''K7'' suffered an engine failure when her air intakes collapsed and debris was drawn into the engine. By the middle of December, some high-speed runs were made, in excess of {{convert|250|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} but still well below Campbell's existing record. Problems with ''Bluebird'''s fuel system meant that the engine could not reach full rpm, and so would not develop maximum power. Eventually, by the end of December, after further modifications to her fuel system, and the replacement of a fuel pump, the fuel starvation problem was fixed, and Campbell awaited better weather to mount an attempt.

===Death===
[[File:Donald Campbell's memorial plaque.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque for Donald Campbell, in Coniston village]]
On 4 January 1967,&lt;ref name=spkdicr&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6DhWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7ugDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5871%2C1363609 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Speed king dies in crash |date=5 January 1967 |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; weather conditions were finally suitable for an attempt. Campbell commenced the first run of his last record attempt at just after 8.45 am. Bluebird moved slowly out towards the middle of the lake, where she paused briefly as Campbell lined her up. With a deafening blast of power, Campbell now applied full throttle and Bluebird began to surge forward. Clouds of spray issued from the jet-pipe, water poured over the rear spar and after a few hundred yards, at 70&amp;nbsp;mph, Bluebird unstuck from the surface and rocketed off towards the southern end of the lake, producing her characteristic comet's tail of spray.
She entered the measured kilometre at 8:46. Leo Villa witnessed her passing the first marker buoy at about {{convert|285|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in perfect steady planing trim, her nose slightly down, still accelerating.
7.525 seconds later, Keith Harrison saw her leave the measured kilometre at a speed of over {{convert|310|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The average speed for the first run was {{convert|297.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Campbell lifted his foot from the throttle about 3/10 of a second before passing the southern kilometre marker. As Bluebird left the measured kilometre, Keith Harrison and Eric Shaw in a course boat at the southern end of the measured kilo both noticed that she was very light around the bows, riding on her front stabilising fins. Her planing trim was no worse than she had exhibited when equipped with the Beryl engine, but it was markedly different from that observed by Leo Villa at the northern end of the kilometre, when she was under full acceleration. Campbell had made his usual commentary throughout the run.


Campbell's words on his first run were, via radio intercom:

{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | text="...&amp;nbsp;I'm under way, all systems normal; brake swept up, er&amp;nbsp;... air pressure warning light on&amp;nbsp;... I'm coming onto track now and er&amp;nbsp;... I'll open up just as soon as I am heading down the lake, er doesn't look too smooth from here, doesn't matter, here we go&amp;nbsp;... Here we go&amp;nbsp;... [pause 3 seconds]&amp;nbsp;... Passing through four&amp;nbsp;... five coming up&amp;nbsp;... a lot of water, nose beginning to lift, water all over the front of the engine again&amp;nbsp;... and the nose is up&amp;nbsp;... low pressure fuel warning light&amp;nbsp;... going left&amp;nbsp;...

Instead of refuelling and waiting for the wash of this run to subside, Campbell decided to make the return run immediately. This was not an unprecedented diversion from normal practice, as Campbell had used the advantage presented i.e. no encroachment of water disturbances on the measured kilometre by the quick turn-a-round, in many previous runs. The second run was even faster once severe tramping subsided on the run-up from Peel Island (caused by the water-brake disturbance). Once smooth water was reached some 700 metres or so from the start of the kilometre, K7 demonstrated cycles of [[ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effect]] hovering before accelerating hard at 0.63g to a peak speed of {{convert|328|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} some 200 metres or so from the southern marker buoy. Bluebird was now experiencing bouncing episodes of the starboard sponson with increasing ferocity. At the peak speed, the most intense and long-lasting bounce precipitated a severe decelerating episode (328&amp;nbsp;mph - 296&amp;nbsp;mph, -1.86g) as K7 dropped back onto the water. Engine flame-out then occurred and, shorn of thrust nose-down momentum, K7 experienced a gliding episode in strong ground effect with increasing angle-of-attack, before completely leaving the water at her static stability pitch-up limit of 5.2°. Bluebird then executed an almost complete somersault (~ 320° and slightly off-axis) before plunging into the water (port sponson marginally in advance of the starboard), approximately 230 metres from the end of the measured kilometre. The boat then cartwheeled across the water before coming to rest. The impact broke K7 forward of the air intakes (where Campbell was sitting) and the main hull sank shortly afterwards.

[[Mr Whoppit]], Campbell's teddy bear mascot, was found among the floating debris and the pilot's helmet was recovered. Royal Navy divers made efforts to find and recover the body but, although the wreck of K7 was found, they called off the search, after two weeks, without locating his body. Campbell's body was finally located in 2001.

Campbell's last words, during a 31-second transmission, on his final run were, via radio intercom:

{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | text="...&amp;nbsp;Full nose up &amp;nbsp;... Pitching a bit down here &amp;nbsp;... coming through our own wash &amp;nbsp;... er getting straightened up now on track &amp;nbsp;... rather closer to Peel Island &amp;nbsp;... and we're tramping like mad &amp;nbsp;... and er &amp;nbsp;... FULL POWER &amp;nbsp;... er tramping like hell OVER. I can't see much and the water's very bad indeed &amp;nbsp;...

U-hh &amp;nbsp;... "&lt;ref name="Sheppard 2011 256" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=BBC News |title=Last words from Bluebird | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2560957.stm | date=10 December 2002 | access-date=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The cause of the crash has been variously attributed to several possible causes (or a combination of these causes): 
* Campbell did not wait to refuel after doing a first run of {{convert|297.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and hence the boat was lighter and travelled through the wash caused by his first run, a wash made much worse by the use of the water brake. These factors have since been found to be not particularly important:&lt;ref name=sheppard&gt;Sheppard, Neil (2011). Donald Campbell Bluebird And The Final Record Attempt. Stroud, UK: The History Press. {{ISBN|978 0 7524 5973 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water brake was used well to the south of the measured distance, and only from approx. {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The area in the centre of the course where Bluebird was travelling at peak speed on her return run was flat calm, and not disturbed by the wash from the first run, which had not had time to be reflected back on the course. Campbell knew this and, as discussed previously, adopted his well-practised, 'quick turn-around' strategy.
* Bluebird may have exceeded its aerodynamic static stability limit, complicated by the additional destabilising influences of loss of engine thrust. There is also evidence to point to the fact that K7's dynamic stability limit had been exceeded. The cause(s) of the engine flame-out cannot be established unequivocally. It could have been due to fuel starvation, damage to some ancillary structural element associated with engine function (following the worst bouncing episode), disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during the pitching episodes, or indeed a combination of all three. Further evidence of lost engine thrust may be seen in both cinematographic and still film recordings of the latter part of the run - as Bluebird left the water, jet exhaust from a functioning engine would have severely disturbed the water surface; no such disturbance or accompanying spray is evident. Also, close examination of such records show no evidence to the effect that the water brake was deployed.&lt;ref name=sheppard /&gt;
* Analysis of film footage suggests that ''Bluebird'' may have hit a duck during test runs, which may have affected the aerodynamic shape of the boat, making it harder to control at extreme speeds.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite web | work=The Telegraph |title=Duck may have played role in fatal Bluebird crash | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8815900/Duck-may-have-played-role-in-fatal-Bluebird-crash.html | first=Richard | last=Gray  | date=9 October 2011 | access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 1967 Campbell was posthumously awarded the [[Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct]] "for courage and determination in attacking the world water speed record."&lt;ref name="brave" /&gt;

==Recovery of Bluebird K7 and the body of Donald Campbell==
The wreckage of Campbell's craft was recovered by the Bluebird Project between October 2000, when the first sections were raised, and May 2001, when Campbell's body was recovered. The largest section comprising approximately two thirds of the centre hull was raised on 8 March 2001. The project began when diver Bill Smith was inspired to look for the wreck after hearing the [[Marillion]] song "Out of this World" (from the album ''[[Afraid of Sunlight]]''), which was written about Campbell and ''Bluebird''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.marillion.com/news/newsitem.htm?id=4 | title= A Day in the Lakes | publisher=marillion.com | first=Steve | last=Hogarth | date=8 March 2001 | accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recovered wreck revealed that the water brake had deployed after the accident as a result of stored accumulator pressure; Campbell would not have had time to deploy the relatively slow-moving brake as the boat flipped out of control. The boat still contained fuel in the engine fuel lines, discounting the fuel-starvation theory. The wreckage all evidenced an impact from left to right, wiping the whole front of the boat off in that direction. Campbell's lower harness mounts had failed and were found to be effectively useless. Further dives recovered various parts of K7, which had separated from the main hull when it broke up on impact.

Campbell's body was finally located just over two months later and recovered from the lake on 28 May 2001, still wearing his blue nylon overalls. On the night before his death, while playing cards he had drawn the queen and the ace of spades. Reflecting upon the fact that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] had drawn the same two cards the night before she was beheaded, he told his mechanics, who were playing cards with him, that he had a fearful premonition that he was going to “get the chop”.&lt;ref&gt; “Disaster on the cards for the man who diced with death”, The Telegraph, 8 Mar 2001
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1325433/Disaster-on-the-cards-for-the-man-who-diced-with-death.html &lt;/ref&gt; It was not possible to determine the cause of Campbell's death, though a consultant engineer giving evidence to the inquest said that the force of the impact could have caused him to be decapitated &lt;ref&gt;"Campbell's daughter clashes over his death", The Telegraph, 26 October 2002 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1411288/Campbells-daughter-clashes-over-his-death.html &lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:DonaldCampbellsGravestone.jpg|thumb|right|Campbell's gravestone in Coniston]]
Campbell was buried in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] Cemetery on 12 September 2001 after his coffin was carried down the lake, and through the measured kilometre, on a launch, one last time. A funeral service was then held at St Andrew's Church in Coniston, after an earlier, and positive DNA examination had been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1537909.stm|title=Final tribute to water speed king|date=12 September 2001|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral was attended by his widow Tonia, daughter Gina, other members of his family, members of his former team and admirers. The funeral was overshadowed in the media by coverage of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] in the [[United States]]. Campbell's sister, Jean Wales, had been against the recovery of her brother's body out of respect for his stated wish that, in the event of something going wrong, "Skipper and boat stay together". Jean Wales did, however, remain in daily telephone contact with project leader Bill Smith during the recovery operation in anticipation of any news of her brother's remains. When Campbell was buried in Coniston Cemetery on 12 September 2001 she did not attend the service. [[Steve Hogarth]], lead singer for Marillion, was present at the funeral and performed the song "Out of this World" solo.

==Legacy==
Between them, Donald Campbell and his father had set eleven speed records on water and ten on land.

The story of Campbell's last attempt at the [[water speed record]] on [[Coniston Water]] was told in the [[BBC]] television film ''Across the Lake'' in 1988, with [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Campbell. Nine years earlier, [[Robert Hardy]] had played Campbell's father, [[Malcolm Campbell|Sir Malcolm Campbell]], in the ''[[BBC2 Playhouse]]'' television drama "Speed King"; both were written by Roger Milner and produced by [[Innes Lloyd]]. In 2003, the BBC showed a documentary reconstruction of Campbell's fateful water-speed record attempt in an episode of ''Days That Shook the World''. It featured a mixture of modern reconstruction and original film footage. All of the original colour clips were taken from a film capturing the event, ''Campbell at Coniston'' by John Lomax, a local amateur filmmaker from Wallasey, England. Lomax's film won awards worldwide in the late 1960s for recording the final weeks of Campbell's life.

In 1956, he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] for the seventh episode of the new television show ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]''.

An [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]] commemorates Campbell and his father at Canbury School, Kingston Hill, Kingston upon Thames, where they lived.&lt;ref name="EngHet"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/campbell-malcolm-donald|title=Campbell, Donald (1921–1967) &amp; Campbell, Sir Malcolm (1885–1948)|publisher=English Heritage| access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the village of Coniston, the [[Ruskin Museum]] has a display of Donald Campbell memorabilia, and the Bristol Orpheus engine recovered in 2001 is also displayed. The engine's casing is mostly missing, having acted as a sacrificial anode in its time underwater, but the internals are remarkably preserved. Campbell's helmet from the ill-fated run is also on display.

==Restoration==
On Thursday 7 December 2006, Gina Campbell, Campbell's daughter, gave Bluebird K7 to the Ruskin Museum in Coniston on behalf of the Campbell Family Heritage Trust. In agreement with the Campbell Family Heritage Trust and the museum, Bill Smith is to organise the restoration of the boat.&lt;ref name="bbc7nov2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-37890287|title=Donald Campbell's Bluebird roars back to life|date=7 November 2016|publisher=BBC News|language=English|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention is to rebuild K7 back to running order circa 4 January 1967.

By May 2009, permission had been received for a one off set of proving trials of Bluebird on Coniston Water, where she will be tested to a safe speed for demonstration purposes only. There was no fixed date for completion of Bluebird K7 or the trials. K7 will be housed in her own purpose-built wing at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, while remaining in the care of the Bluebird Project.

By August 2018, the restoration had progressed far enough that the part-completed craft was transported to the Isle of Bute in Scotland for a low-speed crew training exercise on [[Loch Fad]] &lt;ref name="bbc3aug2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-45037080|title=Donald Campbell's restored Bluebird set for Scotland run|date=3 August 2018|publisher=BBC News|language=English|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The part-restored boat successfully completed runs up to 157mph. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bluebird 7 complete first return legs on Isle of bute |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofLCciRtruE |website=Youtube |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
K7 was exhibited at the Bute Highland games on 11 August 2011 and participated in the massed pipe band procession through the town of Rothesay.

'''Egschiglen''' are a [[Mongolia]]n [[Folk music|folk]] band, formed in [[Ulan Bator]] in 1991. In English, Egschiglen means "Beautiful Melody", and they are one of very few traditional Mongolian bands to have become internationally popular.

From the beginning, Egschiglen set the focus of their artistic work on contemporary music. They systematically explored the sound dimensions of works by classical-modernist [[List of Mongolian composers|Mongolian composers]], using traditional instruments from Mongolia and Central Asia, including the [[morin khuur]] (a violin with two strings made of horse hair), [[Topshur|tobshuur]] (a [[lute]] symbolizing a swan's throat as neck), [[Hammered dulcimer|joochin]] (a type of hammered dulcimer), bass, percussion and singing techniques like khöömii [[Overtone singing|throat singing]].

Their music is characterized by the delicacy and transparency of chamber music, but also by its deeply natural, compelling force. In Egschiglen’s performances, tunes from [[shamanic music|Shamanist]] or [[buddhist music|Buddhist]] tradition, which are common in [[Central Asia]], impress through their diversity of expression and their intricate arrangements.

The musicians also experiment with balancing acts between diverse cultures: in the course of the years, Egschiglen participated in a number of cooperation projects with musicians from various cultural areas. Furthermore, in a relaxed attitude, they present the latest finds from their adopted home, Franconia: traditional song material from the Altmühl valley, arranged as a Mongolian khöömii / morin khuur crossover, which the band has released on their recent album ''Gereg.''

Members of the band are: Tumenbayar Migdorj, Tumursaihan Yanlav, Uuganbaatar Tsend-Ochir, Amartuwshin Baasandorj, Sarangerel Tserevsamba, who are accompanied for live concerts by the female dancer Ariuanaa Tserendavaa.

The '''flag of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]]''' was adopted by the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Kirghiz SSR decreed by its Decree on December 22, 1952. The 1978 constitution of the Kirghiz SSR states that the ratio of the flag is 1:2 with the blue/white/blue stripes in the middle taking {{1/3}} of the flag height and the white stripes {{frac|20}} of flag height. The red, blue and white colors were derived from the [[Pan-Slavic colors]]. 

According to the constitution in detail in article 168:

{{quote|''"The national flag of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] is a [[Red flag (politics)|red cloth]] with a blue stripe in the middle of the entire length of the flag. The blue bar is one third of the width of the flag. Along the blue stripe in the middle is a white strip, equal to one-twentieth of the width of the flag. On the upper red part of the flag, at the shaft, are depicted a golden [[hammer and sickle]] and above them a [[red star|red five-pointed star]] framed with a gold border. The ratio of the width of the flag to its length is 1:2."''|source=Constitution of the Kirghiz SSR, April 20, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;http://statesymbol.ru/sovietsymbol/20050419/39595312.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The flag differences from the [[flag of the Soviet Union]] and the [[flags of the Soviet Republics]] was a larger star (in comparison with the image of the sickle and hammer) and the location of the hammer and sickle practically on the border of the red and blue stripes: on the flags of all other republics (except for Georgia and Turkmenia), the diameter of the circle into which the 5-terminal star was inscribed was exactly half the size of the side of the square in which the sickle and hammer were inscribed, and on the flag of Kirghizia, the diameter of the star (1/10 of the width of the flag) was more than half Side of the square (1/6 of the width of the flag).&lt;ref name=KySSR&gt;http://www.vexillographia.ru/kyrgyz/soviet.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When the Kirghiz SSR (commonly called Kirghizia) was formed in 1936, the flag was red with gold Latin characters in the top-left corner, {{lang|ky|QЬRGЬZSTAN SSR/QЬRGЬZ SSR}} (''Kyrgyz SSR'') and the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] script {{lang|ru|КИРГИЗСКАЯ ССР}} (''Kirgizskaya SSR'') in a sans-serif font. In 1940, the Kyrgyz script was translated from the Latin alphabet into an alphabet based on the Russian alphabet and the inscription in the Kyrgyz language on the flag began to be depicted in a new alphabet. It was renderred as {{lang|ky|КЫРГЫЗ ССР}} and {{lang|ru|КИРГИЗСКАЯ ССР}}.&lt;ref name=KySSR /&gt;

{{Flag entry|Width=180|Image=File:Flag of the Kyrgyz SSR (1940-1952).svg|Caption= Flag of the Kirghiz SSR (1940–1952)}}
{{End flag gallery}}

On December 22, 1952, the red flag was replaced with a new red flag with a blue and white stripes in the middle of the entire length of the flag. 

After independence, this flag remained the flag of the newly independent Kyrgyzstan until 1992 when a [[Flag of Kyrgyzstan|new flag]] was introduced.

'''Greenland''' ({{lang-kl|Kalaallit Nunaat}}, {{IPA-kl|kalaːɬit nunaːt|pron}}; {{lang-da|Grønland}}, {{IPA-da|ˈɡʁɶnˌlanˀ|pron}}) is an autonomous [[Denmark#Greenland and the Faroe Islands|constituent country]] of the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]] between the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] Oceans, east of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]]. Though [[physical geography|physiographically]] a part of the continent of [[North America]], Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically [[Norway]] and Denmark, the [[colonialism|colonial powers]], as well as the nearby island of [[Iceland]]) for more than a millennium.&lt;ref name=Brown2000&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/greenland/ The Fate of Greenland's Vikings], by Dale Mackenzie Brown, ''Archaeological Institute of America'', 28 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of its residents are [[Inuit]], whose ancestors began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.

Greenland is the [[List of islands by area|world's largest island]]. [[Australia]] and [[Antarctica]], although larger, are generally considered to be continental landmasses rather than islands.&lt;ref name="jc"&gt;{{cite web

In the early 18th century, Danish explorers reached Greenland again. To strengthen trading and power, [[Denmark–Norway]] affirmed sovereignty over the island. Because of Norway's weak status, it lost sovereignty over Greenland in 1814 when the union was dissolved. Greenland became Danish in 1814, and was fully integrated in the Danish state in 1953 under the [[Constitution of Denmark]].

In 1973, Greenland joined the [[European Economic Community]] with Denmark.

==Etymology==

The early Viking settlers named the island as ''Greenland.'' In the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic sagas]], the Norwegian-born Icelander [[Erik the Red]] was said to be exiled from [[Iceland]] for manslaughter. Along with his extended family and his [[thrall]]s (i.e. slaves or serfs), he set out in ships to explore an icy land known to lie to the northwest. After finding a habitable area and settling there, he named it ''{{lang|non|{{linktext|Grœnland}}}}'' (translated as "Greenland"), supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17946/17946-h/17946-h.htm |title=Eirik the Red's Saga |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=8 March 2006 |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ancientstandard&gt;[http://ancientstandard.com/2010/12/17/how-greenland-got-its-name/ "How Greenland got its name"].

===Early Paleo-Eskimo cultures===

In [[prehistory|prehistoric times]], Greenland was home to several successive [[Paleo-Eskimo]] cultures known today primarily through archaeological finds. The earliest entry of the Paleo-Eskimo into Greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500&amp;nbsp;BC. From around 2500&amp;nbsp;BC to 800&amp;nbsp;BC, southern and western Greenland were inhabited by the [[Saqqaq culture]]. Most finds of Saqqaq-period archaeological remains have been around [[Disko Bay]], including the site of Saqqaq, after which the culture is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grønnow, B. |year=1988|title= Prehistory in permafrost: Investigations at the Saqqaq site, Qeqertasussuk, Disco Bay, West Greenland|journal= Journal of Danish Archaeology|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 24–39|doi=10.1080/0108464X.1988.10589995|doi-broken-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Møbjerg, T. |year=1999|title= New adaptive strategies in the Saqqaq culture of Greenland, c. 1600–1400 BC|journal= World Archaeology|issue=3|pages= 452–65|jstor=124963|doi=10.1080/00438243.1999.9980423|volume=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norse settlement===
{{See also|Herjolfsnes (Norse Greenland)}}

From 986, Greenland's west coast was settled by [[Icelanders]] and [[Norwegians]], through a contingent of 14 boats led by [[Erik the Red]]. They formed three settlements—known as the [[Eastern Settlement]], the [[Western Settlement]] and the [[Ivittuut|Middle Settlement]]—on [[fjord]]s near the southwestern-most tip of the island.&lt;ref name=Brown2000 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kudeba, N. (19 April 2014). "Chapter 5 – Norse Explorers from Erik the Red to Leif Erikson", in ''Canadian Explorers.''&lt;/ref&gt; They shared the island with the late [[Dorset culture]] inhabitants who occupied the northern and western parts, and later with the [[Thule culture]] that entered from the north. Norse Greenlanders submitted to Norwegian rule in the 13th century under the [[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)]]. Later the [[Kingdom of Norway]] entered into a personal union with Denmark in 1380, and from 1397 was a part of the [[Kalmar Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boraas |first=Tracey |year=2002 |title=Sweden |publisher=Capstone Press |page=24 |isbn=0-7368-0939-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erik the Red's recruitment of others to colonize Greenland has been characterized recently as a land scam, the scam (and the name) portraying Greenland as better farm land than in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Grant Oster, [http://hankeringforhistory.com/unseen-property-cons-and-land-scams-in-history/ "Unseen Property Cons and Land Scams in History"], ''Hankering for History,'' January 2, 2014. (accessed 15 Dec. 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse settlements, such as [[Brattahlíð]], thrived for centuries but disappeared sometime in the 15th century, perhaps at the onset of the [[Little Ice Age]].&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jared Diamond]]|title=[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth [Eng.]|year=2006|isbn=0-14-303655-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from some [[runic]] inscriptions, no contemporary records or [[historiography]] survives from the Norse settlements. Medieval Norwegian sagas and historical works mention Greenland's economy as well as the bishops of [[Gardar (see)|Gardar]] and the collection of tithes. A chapter in the ''[[Konungs skuggsjá]]'' (The King's Mirror) describes Norse Greenland's exports and imports as well as grain cultivation.

Icelandic saga accounts of life in Greenland were composed in the 13th century and later, and do not constitute primary sources for the history of early Norse Greenland.&lt;ref name=Grove /&gt; Modern understanding therefore mostly depends on the physical data from archeological sites. Interpretation of [[ice core]] and [[clam]] shell data suggests that between 800 and 1300, the regions around the fjords of southern Greenland experienced a relatively mild climate several degrees Celsius higher than usual in the North Atlantic,&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;Arnold C. (June 2010) "Cold did in the Norse," ''Earth Magazine''. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; with trees&lt;!--"mild is vague" it makes people believe the climate was temperate ; This sentence also suggests that trees have stopped growing after 1300 and that trees are unable to grow in cold climates --&gt; and [[herbaceous plant]]s growing, and livestock being farmed.

These [[Norse colonization of Greenland|Icelandic settlements]] vanished during the 14th and early 15th&amp;nbsp;centuries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2003/07/17/2858655.htm Why societies collapse]". ABC Science.&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of the Western Settlement coincides with a decrease in summer and winter temperatures. A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability during the [[Little Ice Age]] showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th century to early 14th century—as much as {{convert|6|to|8|C-change}} lower than modern summer temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;William P. Patterson, Kristin A. Dietrich, Chris Holmden, and John T. Andrews (2010) "Two millennia of North Atlantic seasonality and implications for Norse colonies." http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0902522107&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. The Eastern Settlement was likely abandoned in the early to mid-15th century, during this cold period.

Theories drawn from archeological excavations at [[Herjolfsnes]] in the 1920s, suggest that the condition of human bones from this period indicates that the Norse population was [[malnutrition|malnourished]], maybe due to [[Erosion|soil erosion]] resulting from the Norsemen's destruction of natural vegetation in the course of farming, turf-cutting, and wood-cutting. Malnutrition may also have resulted from widespread deaths due to [[pandemic]] [[Infectious disease|plague]];&lt;ref name="IngstadIngstad2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helge Ingstad|author2=Anne Stine Ingstad|title=The Viking Discovery of America: The Excavation of a Norse Settlement in L'Anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gj-I5hdpzGoC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2000|publisher=Breakwater Books|isbn=978-1-55081-158-2|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the decline in temperatures during the Little Ice Age; and armed conflicts with the ''[[Skræling]]s'' (Norse word for Inuit, meaning "wretches"&lt;ref name="Diamond" /&gt;).

''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 40.11 (2013): 3890–902&lt;/ref&gt; More recent evidence suggests that the Norse, who never numbered more than about 2,500, gradually abandoned the Greenland settlements over the 1400s as [[walrus ivory]],&lt;ref name="LeoneKnauf2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark P.

Other theories about the disappearance of the Norse settlement have been proposed;
# Lack of support from the homeland.&lt;ref name="IngstadIngstad2000" /&gt;
# Ship-borne marauders (such as [[Basques|Basque]], English, or German pirates) rather than [[Skraelings]], could have plundered and displaced the Greenlanders.&lt;ref name="TriggerWashburn1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce G.

# They were "the victims of hidebound thinking and of a hierarchical society dominated by the Church and the biggest land owners.

===Thule culture (1300–present)===
[[File:Billeder fra Grønland 11441.tif|thumb|Pictures of Greenland, c. 1863]]
The [[Thule people]] are the ancestors of the current Greenlandic population. No genes from the Paleo-Eskimos have been found in the present population of Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/canada/story/1.2749691 "Inuit were not the first people to settle in the Arctic"], CBC News (Canada), 28 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Thule Culture migrated eastward from what is now known as [[Alaska]] around 1000, reaching Greenland around 1300. The Thule culture was the first to introduce to Greenland such technological innovations as [[dog sled]]s and [[toggling harpoon]]s.

===1500–1814===

In 1500, King [[Manuel&amp;nbsp;I of Portugal]] sent [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Greenland in search of a [[Northwest Passage]] to Asia which, according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], was part of Portugal's sphere of influence. In 1501, Corte-Real returned with his brother, [[Miguel Corte-Real]]. Finding the sea frozen, they headed south and arrived in [[Labrador]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Upon the brothers' return to Portugal, the cartographic information supplied by Corte-Real was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Ercole I d'Este]], [[Duke of Ferrara and of Modena|Duke of Ferrara]], by Alberto Cantino in 1502. The [[Cantino planisphere|''Cantino'' planisphere]], made in Lisbon, accurately depicts the southern coastline of Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;Nebenzahl, Kenneth.

[[File:Old Greenland 1747.jpg|thumb|left|A 1747 map based on Egede's descriptions and misconceptions]]

In 1605–1607, King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] sent a [[Christian IV's expeditions to Greenland|series of expeditions]] to Greenland and Arctic waterways to locate the lost eastern Norse settlement and assert Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were mostly unsuccessful, partly due to leaders who lacked experience with the difficult arctic ice and weather conditions, and partly because the expedition leaders were given instructions to search for the Eastern Settlement on the east coast of Greenland just north of [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]], which is almost inaccessible due to southward [[Drift ice|drifting ice]]. The pilot on all three trips was English explorer [[James Hall (explorer)|James Hall]].

[[File:Legende børn, ca. 1878 (8473597948).jpg|thumb|[[Nuuk|Godthåb]] in Greenland, c. 1878]]
After the Norse settlements died off, Greenland came under the de&amp;nbsp;facto control of various Inuit groups, but the Danish government never forgot or relinquished the claims to Greenland that it had inherited from the Norse. When it re-established contact with Greenland in the early 17th&amp;nbsp;century, Denmark asserted its sovereignty over the island. In 1721, a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by Danish-Norwegian missionary [[Hans Egede]] was sent to Greenland, not knowing whether a Norse civilization remained there. This expedition is part of the Dano-Norwegian colonization of the Americas. After 15&amp;nbsp;years in Greenland, Hans Egede left his son [[Paul Egede]] in charge of the mission there and returned to Denmark, where he established a Greenland Seminary. This new colony was centred at [[Nuuk|Godthåb]] ("Good Hope") on the southwest coast. Gradually, Greenland was opened up to Danish merchants, and closed to those from other countries.

When the union between the crowns of Denmark and Norway was dissolved in 1814, the [[Treaty of Kiel]] severed Norway's former colonies and left them under the control of the Danish monarch. Norway occupied then-uninhabited eastern Greenland as [[Erik the Red's Land]] in July 1931, claiming that it constituted ''[[terra nullius]]''. Norway and Denmark agreed to submit the matter in 1933 to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], which decided against Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_AB/AB_53/01_Groenland_Oriental_Arret.pdf ''Legal Status of Eastern Greenland''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511135249/http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_AB/AB_53/01_Groenland_Oriental_Arret.pdf |date=11 May 2011 }}, PCIJ Series A/B No. 53 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenland's connection to Denmark was severed on 9 April 1940, early in [[History of Greenland during World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II]], after Denmark was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. On 8 April 1941, the United States occupied Greenland to defend it against a possible invasion by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bhnf0fxI260C&amp;pg=PA331 |title=In Danger Undaunted: The Anti-Interventionist Movement of 1940–1941|author=Justus D. Doenecke |publisher=Hoover Press |date=8 July 1941 |isbn=978-0-8179-8841-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States occupation of Greenland continued until 1945. Greenland was able to buy goods from the United States and Canada by selling [[cryolite]] from the mine at [[Ivittuut]]. The major air bases were [[Bluie West-1]] at [[Narsarsuaq Airport|Narsarsuaq]] and [[Bluie West-8]] at [[Kangerlussuaq Airport|Søndre Strømfjord]] (Kangerlussuaq), both of which are still used as Greenland's major international airports. [[Bluie]] was the military code name for Greenland.

During this war, the system of government changed: [[List of governors of Greenland|Governor]] [[Eske Brun]] ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances; Governor Aksel Svane was transferred to the United States to lead the commission to supply Greenland. The Danish [[Slædepatruljen Sirius|Sirius Patrol]] guarded the northeastern shores of Greenland in 1942 using dogsleds. They detected several German [[weather station]]s and alerted American troops, who destroyed the facilities. After the collapse of the Third Reich, [[Albert Speer]] briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in Greenland, but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the [[United States Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Speer|Speer, Albert]]. ''Inside the Third Reich,'' 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940. The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish government]] had maintained a strict monopoly of [[Economy of Greenland|Greenlandic trade]], allowing only small scale [[troaking]] with Scottish whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the [[Landsrådene]], recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950: Greenland was to be a modern [[welfare state]] with Denmark as sponsor and example. In 1953 Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom. Home rule was granted in 1979.

Following World War II, the United States developed a [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] interest in Greenland, and in 1946 the United States offered to buy the island from Denmark for $100,000,000. Denmark refused to sell it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,778870,00.html |work=Time |date=27 January 1947 |title=Deepfreeze Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment050701b.shtml |date=7 May 2001 |title=Let's Buy Greenland! — A complete missile-defense plan |first=John J. |last=Miller |work=National Review |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107010850/http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment050701b.shtml |archivedate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the United States, according to [[WikiLeaks]], remains highly interested in investing in the resource base of Greenland and in tapping hydrocarbons off the Greenlandic coast.&lt;ref&gt;Keil, Kathrin (29 August 2011) [https://web.archive.org/web/20150113180223/http://www.thearcticinstitute.org/2011/08/us-interest-will-us-help-greenland-to.html "U.S. Interests in Greenland – On a Path Towards Full Independence?"], The Arctic Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewskurth.com/pressroom-publications-1165.html Andrews Kurth LLP, "Oil and Gas in Greenland – Still on Ice?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019102737/https://www.andrewskurth.com/pressroom-publications-1165.html |date=19 October 2015}}, Andrewskurth.com.

In 1950 Denmark agreed to allow the US to reestablish [[Thule Air Base]] in Greenland; it was greatly expanded between 1951 and 1953 as part of a unified [[NATO]] [[Cold War]] defense strategy. The local population of three nearby villages was moved more than 100&amp;nbsp;kilometres (62&amp;nbsp;mi) away in the winter. The United States tried to construct a subterranean network of secret nuclear missile launch sites in the Greenlandic ice cap, named [[Project Iceworm]]. It managed this project from [[Camp Century]] from 1960 to 1966 before abandoning it as unworkable. The Danish government did not become aware of the program's mission until 1997, when they discovered it while looking for records related to the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash|crash]] of a nuclear-equipped [[B-52]]&amp;nbsp;bomber at Thule in 1968.

With the 1953 Danish constitution, Greenland's colonial status ended as the island was incorporated into the Danish realm as an [[amt (country subdivision)|amt]] (county). Danish citizenship was extended to Greenlanders. Danish policies toward Greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilation—or de-Greenlandification. During this period, the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of the Danish language in official matters, and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post-secondary education. Many Greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark, and a number lost their cultural ties to Greenland. While the policies "succeeded" in the sense of shifting Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners, the Greenlandic elite began to reassert a Greenlandic cultural identity. A movement developed in favour of independence, reaching its peak in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Loukacheva, Natalia (2007).

University of Toronto Press, p. 25 {{ISBN|9780802094865}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of political complications in relation to Denmark's entry into the European Common Market in 1972, Denmark began to seek a different status for Greenland, resulting in the Home Rule Act of 1979.

This gave Greenland limited autonomy with [[Parliament of Greenland|its own legislature]] taking control of some internal policies, while the [[Folketing|Parliament of Denmark]] maintained full control of external policies, security, and natural resources. The law came into effect on 1 May 1979. The [[List of Danish monarchs|Queen of Denmark]], [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe&amp;nbsp;II]], remains Greenland's [[Head of state]]. In 1985, Greenland left the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) upon achieving self-rule, as it did not agree with the EEC's commercial fishing regulations and an EEC ban on [[pinniped|seal]] skin products.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stern|Stern]], pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; Greenland voters approved a [[Greenlandic self-government referendum, 2008|referendum on greater autonomy]] on 25 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

At least four scientific expedition stations and camps had been established on the ice sheet in the ice-covered central part of Greenland (indicated as pale blue in the map to the right): [[Eismitte]], [[North Ice]], North GRIP Camp and The Raven Skiway. There is a year-round station [[Summit Camp]] on the ice sheet, established in 1989. The radio station [[Jørgen Brønlund Fjord]] was, until 1950, the northernmost permanent outpost in the world.

The extreme north of Greenland, [[Peary Land]], is not covered by an ice sheet, because the air there is too dry to produce snow, which is essential in the production and maintenance of an ice sheet.

Scientists who probed {{convert|2|km|abbr=on|1}} through a Greenland glacier to recover the oldest plant [[DNA]] on record said that the planet was far warmer hundreds of thousands of years ago than is generally believed. DNA of trees, plants, spiders and insects including [[Butterfly|butterflies]] from beneath the southern Greenland glacier was estimated to date to 450,000 to 900,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, according to the remnants retrieved from this long-vanished boreal forest. That view contrasts sharply with the prevailing one that a lush forest of this kind could not have existed in Greenland any later than 2.4&amp;nbsp;million years ago. These DNA samples suggest that the temperature probably reached {{convert|10|C}} in the summer and {{convert|-17|C|1}} in the winter. They also indicate that during the [[Eemian|last]] [[interglacial]] period, 130,000–116,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, when local temperatures were on average {{convert|5|C-change|0}} higher than now, the glaciers on Greenland did not completely melt away.

===Postglacial glacier advances on the peninsula Nuussuaq===
The 1310 m-high Qaqugdluit-mountain-land on the south-side of the peninsula Nuussuaq, situated {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=off}} west of the Greenland inland ice at 70°07'50.92"N 51°44'30.52"W, is exemplary of the numerous mountain areas of West-Greenland.

They have to be classified as belonging to the global glacier advances in the years 1811 to 1850 and 1880 to 1900 ("Little Ice Age"), 1910 to 1930, 1948 and 1953.&lt;ref name=W1968 /&gt; Their snowlines rose step by step up to the level of 1979. The current snowline (Stage 0) runs nearly unchanged. During the oldest Postglacial Stage VII an ice-stream-network from valley glaciers joining each other, has completely covered the landscape. Its nourishing areas consisted of high-lying plateau-glaciers and local ice caps. Due to the uplift of the snowline about that about {{convert|230|m|ft|abbr=off}} – what corresponds to a warming about {{convert|1.5|C-change}}, since 1979 there exists a plateau-glaciation with small glacier tongues hanging down on the margins that nearly did not reach the main valley bottoms any more.&lt;ref name=K1983 /&gt;

[[File:Greenland-musk-ox hg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Muskox]] in Greenland]]

There are approximately 700 known species of insects in Greenland, which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide). The sea is rich in fish and invertebrates, especially in the milder [[West Greenland Current]], and a large part of the Greenland fauna associated with marine production, including large colonies of seabirds. The few native land mammals in Greenland include the [[polar bear]], [[Reindeer hunting in Greenland#Three subspecies in Greenland|reindeer]], [[arctic fox]], [[arctic hare]], [[musk ox]], [[Northern collared lemming|collared lemming]], [[ermine]], and [[arctic wolf]]. The last four are found naturally only in [[East Greenland]], having immigrated from [[Ellesmere Island]]. There are dozens of species of [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[whale]]s along the coast. Land fauna consists predominantly of animals that have spread from North America or for a lot of birds and insects coming from Europe. There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island.&lt;ref name="wildlife"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Natur_og_miljø/Zoologi/Dyreliv:_Danmark,_Færøerne,_Grønland/Grønland_(Dyreliv) |title=Greenland Wildlife |year=2014 |work=Redaction |publisher=The Great Danish Encyclopedia |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Greenland belongs to the Arctic province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The island is sparsely populated in vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland and small bushes, which is regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Greenland is the European white birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]'') along with gray-leaf willow (''[[Salix glauca]]''), rowans (''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]''), common junipers (''[[Juniperus communis]]'') and other smaller trees, mainly willows.

Greenland's flora comprises about 500 species of higher plants, i.e. [[flowering plant]]s, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[lycopodiophyta]]. Of the other groups, the [[lichen]]s are the largest with about 950 species; of major fungal species are known 600–700; [[moss]]es and [[algae]] anything less. Most of Greenland's higher plants are widespread, particularly in arctic and alpine regions, and only a dozen species of particular [[saxifrage]] and [[hawkweed]] is endemic. A few species were introduced by the Norsemen, such as [[Vicia cracca|cow vetch]].

The animals of Greenland include the [[Greenland dog]], which was introduced by the [[Inuit]], as well as [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]-introduced species such as [[Greenlandic sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[cattle]], [[reindeer]], [[horse]], [[chicken]] and [[sheepdog]], all descendants of animals imported by Europeans. [[Marine mammals]] include the [[hooded seal]] (''Cystophora cristata'') as well as the [[grey seal]] (''Halichoerus grypus'').&lt;ref name="brit1911"&gt;"Greenland". ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whale]]s frequently pass very close to Greenlandic shores in the late summer and early autumn. Species represented include the [[beluga whale]], [[blue whale]], [[bowhead whale|Greenland whale]], [[fin whale]], [[humpback whale]], [[minke whale]], [[narwhal]], [[pilot whale]], [[sperm whale]].&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenland-guide.gl/animal_life.htm|title=Animal life in Greenland – an introduction by the tourist board|website=Greenland Guide|publisher=Narsaq Tourist Office|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 225 species of fish are known from the waters surrounding Greenland, and the [[fishing industry]] is a major part of Greenland's economy, accounting for the majority of the country's total exports.

Birds, especially seabirds, are an important part of Greenland's animal life. On steep mountainsides breed large colonies of [[auk]]s, [[puffin]]s, [[skua]]s, and [[kittiwake]]s. By common ducks include [[eider]]s, [[long-tailed duck]]s and the [[king eider]] and in West Greenland [[white-fronted goose]] and in East Greenland [[pink-footed goose]] and [[barnacle goose]]. Breeding migratory birds are also including [[snow bunting]], [[lapland bunting]], [[ringed plover]], [[red-throated loon]] and [[red-necked phalarope]]. Of land birds that are usually sedentary, can be highlighted [[arctic redpoll]], [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]], [[short-eared owl]], [[snowy owl]], [[gyrfalcon]] and in West Greenland the [[white-tailed eagle]].&lt;ref name="wildlife" /&gt;

[[File:Central administration of Greenland.jpg|thumb|Greenland Government Building]]

The Kingdom of Denmark is a [[constitutional monarchy]], in which [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] is the head of state. The monarch officially retains [[Executive (government)|executive power]] and presides over the [[Danish Council of State|Council of State]] ([[privy council]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The executive power is vested in the King." [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html The Constitution of Denmark – Section 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The body of Ministers shall form the Council of State, in which the Successor to the Throne shall have a seat when he is of age.  The Council of State shall be presided over by the King..." [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html The Constitution of Denmark – Section 17.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the introduction of a [[parliamentary system]] of government, the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and [[ceremonial]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today The Monarchy today] – ''The Danish Monarchy'' (kongehuset.dk). Access date: 16 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] and other ministers in the executive government. The monarch is not answerable for his or her actions, and the monarch's person is sacrosanct.&lt;ref&gt;"The King shall not be answerable for his actions; his person shall be sacrosanct." [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html The Constitution of Denmark – Section 13.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political system===
The party system is dominated by the social-democratic [[Forward (Greenland)|Forward]] Party, and the democratic socialist [[Inuit Community]] Party, both of which broadly argue for greater independence from Denmark. While the [[Greenlandic parliamentary election, 2009|2009 election]] saw the unionist—and largely Danish—[[Democrats (Greenland)|Democrat]] Party (2&amp;nbsp;MPs) decline greatly, the [[Greenlandic parliamentary election, 2013|2013 election]] consolidated the power of the two main parties at the expense of the smaller groups, and saw the [[Eco-socialism|eco-socialist]] [[Inuit Party]]  elected to the [[Parliament of Greenland|Parliament]] for the first time. The dominance of the Forward and Inuit Community parties began to wane after the snap [[Greenlandic general election, 2014|2014]] elections, and [[Greenlandic general election, 2018|2018]] elections.

The non-binding [[Greenlandic self-government referendum, 2008|2008 referendum on self-governance]] favoured increased self-governance 21,355 votes to 6,663.

In 1985, [[Greenland–European Union relations|Greenland left the European Economic Community]] (EEC), unlike Denmark, which remains a member. The EEC later became the [[European Union]] (EU, renamed and expanded in scope in 1992). Greenland retains some ties with the EU via Denmark. However, EU law largely does not apply to Greenland except in the area of trade.  Greenland is a member state of the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name="47 Member States"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/47-members-states|title=47 Member States|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
{{Main|Politics of Greenland}}
[[File:Greenland-municipalities-2018.svg|thumb|upright|Municipalities of Greenland]]

Greenland's [[head of state]] is [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe&amp;nbsp;II]], [[Queen regnant]] of Denmark. The Queen's [[politics of Denmark|government in Denmark]] appoints a [[List of Danish High Commissioners in Greenland|High Commissioner]] (''Rigsombudsmand'') to represent it on the island. The commissioner is [[Mikaela Engell]].

Greenlanders elect two representatives to the [[Folketing]], Denmark's parliament, out of a total of 179. The representatives are [[Aleqa Hammond]] of the [[Siumut]] Party and [[Aaja Chemnitz Larsen]] of the [[Inuit Community]] Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.dk/ Folketinget – Folketinget.dk]. Ft.dk. Retrieved on 21 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenland also has its own [[Parliament of Greenland|Parliament]], which has 31&amp;nbsp;members. The government is the [[Naalakkersuisut]] whose members are appointed by the Premier. The [[head of government]] is the [[List of Premiers of Greenland|Premier]], usually the leader of the majority party in Parliament. The Premier is [[Kim Kielsen]] of the Siumut Party.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Greenland}}

Formerly consisting of three counties comprising a total of 18 municipalities, Greenland abolished these in 2009 and has since been divided into large territories known as "municipalities" ({{lang-kl|kommuneqarfiit}}, {{lang-da|kommuner}}): ''[[Sermersooq]]'' ("Much Ice") around the capital [[Nuuk]] and also including all [[Tunu|East Coast]] communities; ''[[Kujalleq]]'' ("South") around [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]]; ''[[Qeqqata]]'' ("Centre") north of the capital along the [[Davis Strait]]; ''[[Qeqertalik]]'' ("The one with islands") surrounding [[Disko Bay]]; and ''[[Avannaata]]'' ("Northern") in the northwest; the latter two having come into being as a result of the [[Qaasuitsup]] municipality, one of the original four, being partitioned in 2018. The northeast of the island composes the unincorporated ''[[Northeast Greenland National Park]]''. ''[[Thule Air Base]]'' is also unincorporated, an enclave within Avannaata municipality administered by the [[United States Air Force]]. During its construction, there were as many as 12,000 American residents but in recent years the number has been below 1,000.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Greenland}}

[[File:Greenland Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|Graphical depiction of Greenland's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories]]

The Greenlandic economy is highly dependent on fishing. Fishing accounts for more than 90% of Greenland's exports.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/28/greenland-narsaq-uranium-mine-dividing-town|title=‘You can't live in a museum’: the battle for Greenland's uranium|last=Walsh|first=Maurice|date=2017-01-28|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[shrimp]] and [[fish]] industry is by far the largest income earner.&lt;ref name="cia-factbook" /&gt;

Greenland is abundant in minerals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mining of [[ruby]] deposits began in 2007. Other mineral prospects are improving as prices are increasing. These include iron, [[uranium]], aluminium, nickel, [[platinum]], [[tungsten]], [[titanium]], and copper. Despite resumption{{when|date=January 2014}} of several [[hydrocarbon]] and mineral exploration activities, it will take several years before hydrocarbon production can materialize. The state oil company [[Nunaoil]] was created to help develop the hydrocarbon industry in Greenland. The state company Nunamineral has been launched on the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] to raise more capital to increase the production of gold, started in 2007.

[[File:Akamalik-royal-greenland-sisimiut-port.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Greenland]] fishing vessel "Akamalik", anchored at [[Sisimiut]]]]

Electricity has traditionally been generated by oil or diesel power plants, even if there is a large surplus of potential [[hydropower]]. There is a programme to build hydro power plants. The first, and still the largest, is [[Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant]].

There are also plans to build a large aluminium smelter, using hydropower to create an exportable product. It is expected that much of the labour needed will be imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[European Union]] has urged Greenland to restrict People's Republic of China development of [[rare-earth]] projects, as China accounts for 95% of the world's current supply. In early 2013, the Greenland government said that it had no plans to impose such restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-10/chinese-workers-in-greenland ''Chinese Workers—in Greenland?''] 10 February 2013 ''[[BusinessWeek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe.

Greenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. But, since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and [[zinc]] mine that year. More recently,{{when|date=January 2014}} new sources of [[ruby]] in Greenland have been discovered, promising to bring new industry and a new export from the country. (See [[Gemstone industry in Greenland]]).

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in Greenland|List of airports in Greenland}}
[[File:AirGreenland Airbus (11832722805).jpg|thumb|[[Air Greenland]] Airbus [[A330-200]] in-flight]]
[[File:The Town of Ilulissat, Greenland, as Seen From Secretary Kerry's Plane (27795542865).jpg|thumb|The port of [[Ilulissat]]]]

Air transportation exists both within Greenland and between the island and other nations. There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency. There are virtually no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network. The only exception is a gravel road of 3 miles length between [[Kangilinnguit]] and the now abandoned former [[cryolite]] mining town of [[Ivittuut]].&lt;ref name="iExplore"&gt;[https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/north-america/greenland/transportation Article about transportation in Greenland on iExplore.com, retrieved October 10, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few countryside roads have been built.

All civil aviation matters are handled by the [[Danish Transport Authority]]. Most airports including [[Nuuk Airport]] have short runways and can only be served by special fairly small aircraft on fairly short flights. [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]] around {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} inland from the west coast is the major airport of Greenland and the hub for domestic flights. Intercontinental flights connect mainly to [[Copenhagen]]. Travel between international destinations (except Iceland) and any city in Greenland requires a plane change.

[[Air Iceland]] operates flights from [[Reykjavík]] to a number of airports in Greenland, and the company promotes the service as a day-trip option from Iceland for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perrin|first1=Wendy|title=Greenland Day Trip from Iceland: Is it Worth It?|url=http://www.wendyperrin.com/greenland-day-trip-from-iceland-is-it-worth-it/|website=Wendy Perrin|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no direct flights to the United States or Canada, although there have been flights Kangerlussuaq – [[Baltimore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenland.com/content/english/tourist/news/news_archive/historical_maiden_flight_us-greenland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006075245/http://www.greenland.com/content/english/tourist/news/news_archive/historical_maiden_flight_us-greenland |archivedate=6 October 2008 |title=Historical Maiden Flight US-Greenland – Official national guide by Greenland Tourism and Business Council |publisher=Greenland.com |date=24 May 2007 |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nuuk – [[Iqaluit]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2012/06/07/north-greenland-first-air.html |title=Air Greenland teams with First Air for Iqaluit flights|work=CBC News|date= 7 June 2012|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were cancelled because of too few passengers and financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airgreenland.com/nyhed/?newsid=666 |title=The Baltimore route is to close |work=Air Greenland |date=12 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518074701/http://www.airgreenland.com/nyhed/?newsid=666 |archivedate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative between Greenland and the United States/Canada is Air Iceland/[[Icelandair]] with a plane change in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 Ways to Get to Greenland|url=https://www.fodors.com/news/4-ways-to-get-to-greenland-7070|website=Fodor's|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea [[passenger]] and [[Cargo|freight]] transport is served by the coastal ferries operated by [[Arctic Umiaq Line]]. It makes a single round trip per week, taking 80 hours each direction.

Greenland has a population of 56,370 (January 2013 estimate),&lt;ref name="Greenland in Figures 2013" /&gt; of whom 88% are [[Greenlandic Inuit]] (including [[mixed race|mixed]] persons). The remaining 12% are of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] descent, mainly [[Danish people in Greenland|Greenland Danes]]. Several thousand [[Greenlandic people in Denmark|Greenlandic Inuit reside in the Danish Peninsula]]. The majority of the population is [[Church of Denmark|Lutheran]]. Nearly all Greenlanders live along the fjords in the south-west of the main island, which has a relatively mild climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stalvik.com/Engelska/laegreenland.htm |title=Greenland |publisher=Stalvik.com |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 17,000 people reside in [[Nuuk]], the capital city.

===Languages===
[[File:Parkverbot Grönland.jpg|thumb|A bilingual sign in Nuuk, displaying the Danish and Kalaallisut for "Parking forbidden for all vehicles"]]

Both [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] (an [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] language) and [[Danish language|Danish]] have been used in public affairs since the establishment of home rule in 1979; the majority of the population can speak both languages. Greenlandic became the sole official language in June 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Danish is still widely used in the administration and in higher education, as well as remaining the first or only language for some Danish immigrants in Nuuk and other larger towns. Debate about the roles of Greenlandic and Danish in the country's future is ongoing. The orthography of Greenlandic was established in 1851&lt;ref&gt;Kleinschmidt, Samuel 1968 (1851): Grammatik der grønlændischen Sprache : mit teilweisem Einschluss des Labradordialekts. Hildesheim : Olms, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kalaallisut orthography|revised]] in 1973. The country has a 100% literacy rate.&lt;ref name="cia-factbook"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the population speaks Greenlandic, most of them bilingually. It is spoken by about 50,000 people, making it the most populous of the Eskimo–Aleut language family, spoken by more people than all the other languages of the family combined.

Kalaallisut is the Greenlandic dialect of West Greenland, which has long been the most populous area of the island. This has led to its de&amp;nbsp;facto status as the official "Greenlandic" language, although the northern dialect [[Inuktun]] remains spoken by 1,000 or so people around [[Qaanaaq]], and the eastern dialect [[Tunumiit dialect|Tunumiisut]] by around 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Mennecier, Philippe (1978). ''Le tunumiisut, dialecte inuit du Groenland oriental: description et analyse'', Collection linguistique, 78, Societé de linguistique de Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these dialects is almost unintelligible to the speakers of the other and are considered by some linguists to be separate languages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} A [[UNESCO]] report has labelled the other dialects as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect the East Greenlandic dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

About 12% of the population speak Danish as a first or sole language, particularly Danish immigrants in Greenland, many of whom fill positions such as administrators, professionals, academics, or skilled tradesmen. While Greenlandic is dominant in all smaller settlements, a part of the population of Inuit or mixed ancestry, especially in towns, speaks Danish. Most of the Inuit population speaks Danish as a second language. In larger towns, especially Nuuk and in the higher social strata, this is still a large group. While one strategy aims at promoting Greenlandic in public life and education, developing its vocabulary and suitability for all complex contexts, there are opponents of this.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

English is another important language for Greenland, taught in schools from the first school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eu.nanoq.gl/Emner/About%20Greenland/Travelling%20in%20Greenland.aspx |title=Travelling in Greenland |publisher=Greenland Representation to the EU, Greenland Home Rule Government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516025948/http://eu.nanoq.gl/Emner/About%20Greenland/Travelling%20in%20Greenland.aspx |archivedate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomadic [[Inuit people]] were traditionally [[shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanistic]], with a well-developed [[Inuit mythology|mythology]] primarily concerned with appeasing a vengeful and [[Sedna (mythology)|fingerless sea goddess]] who controlled the success of the [[seal hunting|seal]] and [[whaling|whale hunts]].

The first [[Norse colonization of Greenland|Norse colonists]] worshipped the [[Norse religion|Norse gods]], but [[Erik the Red]]'s son [[Leif Ericson|Leif]] was converted to Christianity by [[List of Norwegian monarchs|King]] [[Olaf Trygvesson]] on a trip to Norway in 999 and sent missionaries back to Greenland. These swiftly established sixteen parishes, some monasteries, and a bishopric at [[Garðar, Greenland|Garðar]].

Rediscovering these colonists and spreading ideas of the [[Danish Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] among them was one of the primary reasons for the [[Danish colonization of Greenland|Danish recolonization]] in the 18th century. Under the patronage of the [[Royal Mission College]] in Copenhagen, Norwegian and Danish [[Church of Denmark|Lutherans]] and German [[Moravian missions in Greenland|Moravian missionaries]] searched for the missing Norse settlements, but no Norse were found, and instead they began preaching to the Inuit. The principal figures in the [[Christianization]] of Greenland were [[Hans Egede|Hans]] and [[Poul Egede]] and [[Matthias Stach]]. The [[New Testament]] was translated piecemeal from the time of the very first settlement on Kangeq Island, but the first translation of the whole Bible was not completed until 1900. An improved translation using the [[Kalaallisut orthography|modern orthography]] was completed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sørensen, Leif Kiil |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/225350:Kirke---tro--Groenlandsk-bibel-praesenteret |title=Grønlandsk bibel præsenteret &amp;#124; Kristeligt Dagblad |publisher=Kristeligt-dagblad.dk |date=29 November 2000 |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the major religion is [[Protestant]] [[Christianity]], represented mainly by the [[Church of Denmark]], which is [[Lutheran]] in orientation. While there are no official census data on religion in Greenland, the [[Bishop of Greenland]] [[Sofie Petersen]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120325215706/http://www.oikoumene.org/news/news-management/eng/a/article/1634/bells-ring-a-wake-up-call.html "Bells ring a wake-up call for climate justice."] ''World Council of Churches''. 14 December 2010. Retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; estimates that 85% of the Greenlandic population are members of her congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groenlandsstift.dk/fileadmin/filer/Biskoppen/Groenland_GRUNDLOVEN_og_GEJSTLIGHEDEN_1005_2009_laast_til_ado.pdf |title=Grønland, Grundloven og Gejstligheden |format=PDF |accessdate=30 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231654/https://www.groenlandsstift.dk/fileadmin/filer/Biskoppen/Groenland_GRUNDLOVEN_og_GEJSTLIGHEDEN_1005_2009_laast_til_ado.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Denmark is the [[State religion|established church]] through the [[Constitution of Denmark]]:

This applies to all of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], except for the [[Faroe Islands]], as the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] became independent in 2007.

The [[Roman Catholic]] minority is pastorally served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. There are still Christian missionaries on the island, but mainly from [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic movements]] [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] fellow Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Faheem |title=Ramadan in Greenland |url=http://www.masjids.in/ramadan/ramadan-in-greenland/ |publisher=Masjids.in |accessdate=7 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022152720/https://www.masjids.in/ramadan/ramadan-in-greenland/ |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim in Greenland who Fasts for 21 hours |url=http://mynewshub.my/2011/08/13/the-only-muslim-in-greenland-who-fasts-for-21-hours/ |accessdate=7 May 2012 |newspaper=Malaysia News Hub |date=13 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228082117/http://mynewshub.my/2011/08/13/the-only-muslim-in-greenland-who-fasts-for-21-hours/ |archivedate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wetaka|first=Ahmed|title=The only Muslim in Greenland who fasts for 21 hours|url=http://um-bs.com/2011/08/16/the-only-muslim-in-greenland-who-fasts-for-21-hours/|publisher=Uganda Muslims|accessdate=7 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630040921/http://um-bs.com/2011/08/16/the-only-muslim-in-greenland-who-fasts-for-21-hours/|archivedate=30 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ramadan in Greenland: The only Muslim in the island fasts for 21 hours|url=http://www.ummid.com/news/2011/August/12.08.2011/only_muslim_in_greenland.htm|accessdate=7 May 2012|publisher=Ummid.com|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social issues===
The rate of [[suicide in Greenland]] is very high. According to a 2010 census, Greenland holds [[List of countries by suicide rate|the highest suicide rate in the world]].&lt;ref name="The Suicide Capital of the World"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Suicide Capital of the World|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2009/10/the_suicide_capital_of_the_world.single.html#pagebreak_anchor_2|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rising suicide rate baffles Greenland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rising suicide rate baffles Greenland|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/blog/europe/rising-suicide-rate-baffles-greenland|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant social issues faced by Greenland are high rates of unemployment, alcoholism, and HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18249474 "Greenland profile – Overview"]. ''BBC News''.&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol consumption rates in Greenland reached their height in the 1980s, when it was twice as high as in Denmark, and had by 2010 fallen slightly below the average level of consumption in Denmark (which is the 12th highest in the world). But at the same time alcohol prices are much higher, meaning that consumption has a high social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aage, H. |year=2012|title= Alcohol in Greenland 1951–2010: consumption, mortality, prices|journal= International Journal of Circumpolar Health|volume= 71|page=18444|doi=10.3402/ijch.v71i0.18444|pmid=23256091|pmc=3525923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Madsen, M.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Greenland|Music of Greenland}}
[[File:Nive Nielsen Rudolstadt 01.jpg|thumb| [[Nive Nielsen]], Greenlandic singer and songwriter]]
[[File:Inuk Silis Høegh, Tommi Kainulainen - WOMEX 15, Budapest, 2015.10.22 (1).JPG|thumb| Panel discussion with Greenlandic movie maker [[Inuk Silis Høegh]] at the launch of his movie about groundbreaking Greenlandic band [[Sume (band)|Sumé]]. Journalist and Sumé's record producer Karsten Sommer is speaking.]]

Today Greenlandic culture is a blending of traditional Inuit ([[Kalaallit]]) and Scandinavian culture. Inuit, or Kalaallit, culture has a strong artistic tradition, dating back thousands of years. The Kalaallit are known for an art form of figures called ''[[tupilak]]'' or a "spirit object." Traditional art-making practices thrive in the ''Ammassalik''.&lt;ref name=ingo20&gt;[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sperm whale]] ivory remains a valued medium for carving.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hessel|Hessel]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenland also has a successful, albeit small, music culture. Some popular [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] bands and artists include [[Sume (band)|Sume]] (classic rock), [[Chilly Friday]] (rock), [[Nanook]] (rock), [[Siissisoq]] (rock), [[Nuuk Posse]] (hip hop) and [[Rasmus Lyberth]] (folk), who performed in the [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979|Danish Eurovision Song Contest 1979]], performing in Greenlandic. The singer-songwriter [[Simon Lynge]] is the first musical artist from Greenland to have an album released across the United Kingdom, and to perform at the UK's [[Glastonbury Festival]]. The music culture of Greenland also includes traditional [[Inuit music]], largely revolving around singing and drums.

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in Greenland}}
Sport is an important part of Greenlandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular sports include [[association football]], [[track and field]], [[Team handball|handball]] and [[skiing]]. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,&lt;ref name=handball&gt;[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greenland national handball team|Greenland's men's national team]] was ranked among the top 20 in the world in 2001.

Greenland has excellent conditions for [[skiing]], [[fishing]], [[snowboarding]], [[ice climbing]] and [[rock climbing]], although [[mountain climbing]] and [[hiking]] are preferred by the general public. Although the country's environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there are nevertheless golf courses on the island.

The '''imperial coat of arms of the [[Central African Empire]]''' consists of a shield in the centre, with two flags on its edges, and with a sun rising over the shield, with an imperial eagle in the centre. With the imperial crown of [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa|Bokassa I]] above, below and above the shield are banners, and there is a medal located below the shield as well.

==Symbolism==
'''Zo Kwe Zo''', the motto on the left, means  "A person is a person" in Sango.
'''Zo A Yeke Zo''' ("A person is also a person")&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, Richard and Juan Fandos-Rius, ''Historical Dictionary of the Central African Republic'' (2016),  p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; is the motto on the right.

The elephant and the baobab tree represent nature and the backbone of the country. The gold star on a map of Africa symbolizes the position of the Central African Empire. The hand (bottom right corner) was the symbol of the dominant party in 1963 when the original arms were adopted.
The bottom left corner holds 3 diamonds, this symbolizes the mineral resources of the country.

The medal under the shield is the honorific decoration of the Order of Central African Merit.

'''India–Latvia relations''' refer to the bilateral relations between [[India]] and [[Latvia]]. Two countries established diplomatic relations at 1991, following the independence of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/Latvia_2015_07_02.pdf|title=India-Latvia relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's mission to Latvia is accredited from the Indian embassy in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]; while Latvia maintains an embassy and a consulate in [[New Delhi]].

==Economic relations==
In 2013, Latvia and India signed an agreement avoiding double taxation, which increased Indian exports to Latvia in term of economic benefits between two nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=http://irlat.com/latvia-india-double-taxation-avoidance-agreement-to-be-signed-in-near-future/|title=LATVIA-INDIA DOUBLE TAXATION AVOIDANCE AGREEMENT TO BE SIGNED IN NEAR FUTURE|date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently two countries are discussing on building a closer and deeper cooperation in transports and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=http://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/news/latest-news/56959-latvia-and-india-need-to-build-closer-cooperation-in-transport-and-logistics|title=Latvia and India need to build closer cooperation in transport and logistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India sees Latvia, as well as [[Estonia]] and [[Lithuania]], as strategic partners of Indian interests in the [[Baltics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lu.lv/eng/news/t/4551/|title=From India to Latvia: Interest in the Baltic States Brings to Riga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State visits==
In 2017, Latvian Prime Minister [[Māris Kučinskis]] visited India to accelerate the development of economic relations between the countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=https://www.mk.gov.lv/en/aktualitates/kucinskis-objective-visit-india-accelerate-development-economic-relations-between|title=Kučinskis: The objective of visit to India is to accelerate the development of economic relations between the countries|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''krar''' or '''kraar''' is a five- or six-stringed bowl-shaped [[lyre]] from [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]]. It is tuned to a [[pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] [[Scale (music)|scale]]. A modern ''krar'' may be [[Instrument amplifier|amplified]], much in the same way as an [[electric guitar]] or [[electric violin|violin]].

==Features==
A [[chordophone]], the krar is usually decorated with wood, cloth and [[bead]]s. Its five or six strings determine the available [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]es. The instrument's [[Timbre|tone]] depends on the musician's playing technique: bowing, strumming or plucking.  If plucked, the instrument will produce a soft tone. [[Strum]]ming, on the other hand, will yield a [[harmony|harmonious]] [[pulse (music)|pulsation]].

A krar is often played by musician-singers called ''[[azmari]]''. It usually accompanies [[love song]]s and [[secular music|secular songs]].

'''Malidzano''' is a traditional [[Macedonian cuisine|Macedonian]] spread made from puréed [[bell pepper]]s, [[eggplant]], [[oil]], [[salt]] and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]] (optional). It derives its name from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for eggplant, ''melanzane''. Malidzano is usually served as an [[appetizer]] with a side of [[bread]] like spread and piece of white cheese. In other countries of Western Balkans (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia), it is prepared with both green or red peppers so the color of the spread depends from that.

The '''Markets in Financial Instruments Directive''' 2004/39/EC (known colloquially as "'''MiFID'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:02004L0039-20060428:EN:NOT|title=Directive 2004/39/EC|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|year=2004|accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as subsequently amended&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:076:0033:0036:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2008/10/EC|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|year=2008|accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[European Union law]] that provides harmonised regulation for investment services across the 31 member states of the [[European Economic Area]] (the 28 EU [[EU member states|member states]] plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). The directive's main objectives are to increase competition and [[investor protection]] in investment services. As of the effective date, 1 November 2007, it replaced the Investment Services Directive (ISD).&lt;ref&gt;Directive 93/22/EEC&lt;/ref&gt;

MiFID is the cornerstone of the European Commission's [[Financial Services Action Plan]], whose 42 measures will significantly change how EU financial service markets operate. MiFID is the most significant piece of legislation introduced under the [[Lamfalussy process|Lamfalussy procedure]] designed to accelerate the adopting of legislation based on a [[four-level approach]] recommended by the [[Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets|Committee of Wise Men]] chaired by Baron [[Alexandre Lamfalussy]]. There are three other "Lamfalussy Directives"—the Prospectus Directive, the Market Abuse Directive and the Transparency Directive.

MiFID retained the principles of the EU "passport" introduced by the [[Investment Services Directive]] (ISD) but introduced the concept of "maximum harmonization" which places more emphasis on home state supervision. This is a change from the prior EU financial service legislation which featured a "minimum harmonization and mutual recognition" concept. "Maximum harmonization" does not permit states to be "super equivalent" or to "[[Gold-plating (European Union law)|gold-plate]]" EU requirements detrimental to a "level playing field". Another change was the abolition of the "concentration rule" in which member states could require investment firms to route client orders through regulated markets.&lt;ref&gt;This option was not taken up by all EU states.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://mifiddatabase.cesr.eu/ CESR MiFID databases] for a list of regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities, systematic internalisers and shares.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MiFID Level 1 Directive 2004/39/EC, implemented through the standard [[co-decision procedure]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], and the [[European Parliament]], sets out a detailed framework for the legislation. Twenty articles of this directive specified technical implementation measures (Level 2). These measures were adopted by the [[European Commission]], based on technical advice from the [[Committee of European Securities Regulators]] and negotiations in the [[European Securities Committee]] with oversight by the [[European Parliament]]. Implementation measures in the form of a Commission Directive and Commission Regulation were officially published on 2 September 2006.&lt;ref name="directive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_241/l_24120060902en00260058.pdf|title=COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/73/EC|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|year=2006|accessdate=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comreg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_241/l_24120060902en00010025.pdf|title=COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1287/2006|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|year=2006|accessdate=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Under European law, a Directive has to be transposed into national law: a Regulation, on the other hand, is automatically binding throughout all member states.&lt;/ref&gt;

After its initial implementation, MiFID was intended to be reviewed.  After extensive discussion and debate, in April 2014, the European Parliament approved both MiFID II, an updated version of the original MiFID law, and MiFID II's accompanying regulation, MiFIR.&lt;ref name=Holley14&gt;{{cite news |title=European Parliament passes "sensible" MiFID II |author=Elliott Holley |url=http://www.bankingtech.com/217362/european-parliament-passes-sensible-mifid-ii/ |work=Banking Technology |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive and regulation include fewer exemptions and expand the scope of the original MiFID to cover a larger group of companies and financial products.&lt;ref name="Smith14"&gt;{{cite news |title=ESMA unveils final guidance on MiFID II rules |author=Hannah Smith |url=http://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/news/2387771/esma-unveils-final-guidance-for-mifid-ii-rules |work=Investment Week |date=19 December 2014 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Changing14&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/mifid-ii/what-is-changing |title=MiFID II – what is changing? |date=9 December 2014 |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority |accessdate=27 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203100127/http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/mifid-ii/what-is-changing |archivedate=3 February 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MiFID II and MiFIR are effective from 3 January 2018.

==Background and history==
MiFID was intended to replace the Investment Services Directive, which was adopted in 1993.&lt;ref name=Legislationforce&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/isd/mifid/index_en.htm |title=Legislation in force: MiFID I |date=18 February 2015 |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law creates a single market for investment services and activities, which improves the competitiveness in EU markets.&lt;ref name=Legislationforce/&gt; While the original law did succeed in lowering prices and expanding choices for investors, weaknesses in MiFID's structure became apparent during the financial crisis in 2008.&lt;ref name=EC2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/docs/isd/mifid/COM_2011_656_en.pdf|title=Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments repealing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council|date=20 October 2011 |work=European Commission |format=PDF |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MiFID was also intended to make changes to share-trading, and it set guidelines for the use of related financial instruments.&lt;ref name=Legislationforce/&gt; The law was introduced in order to reduce [[systemic risk]] and strengthen existing investor protections.&lt;ref name=Hume15&gt;{{cite news |title=Trafigura says European trading rules have ‘little justification’ |author=Neil Hume |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f7a67662-cf1e-11e4-9949-00144feab7de.html |work=Financial Times |date=22 March 2015 |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the approval process for MiFID, a proposal from the European Commission was read by European Parliament in March 2004.&lt;ref name=Hemetsberger08&gt;{{cite book |title=European Banking and Financial Services Law |author=Walburga Hemetsberger |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=European Association of Public Banks |location= |isbn= |page=67 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2tx8ZX7S7PgC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;ots=sQ32WlpNWg&amp;dq=european%20parliament%20reading%20MiFID%20march%202004&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q=european%20parliament%20reading%20MiFID%20march%202004&amp;f=false |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECflowchart&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/stepbystep/diagram_en.htm |title=Codecision Flowchart |date=21 August 2012 |publisher=The European Commission |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, the Commission published consultation responses it received in 2005. In June 2006, the Commission published a new draft of MiFID.&lt;ref name=MIFIDIimp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/isd/archives_en.htm |title=MiFID – Archives |date=18 February 2015 |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EC and Parliament discussed any suggested amendments to approve Level One texts.&lt;ref name=ESMApaper14&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/content/Consultation-Paper-MiFID-IIMiFIR|title=Consultation Paper on MiFID II/MiFIR|publisher=ESMA|accessdate=16 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408232204/http://www.esma.europa.eu/content/Consultation-Paper-MiFID-IIMiFIR|archivedate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second reading of the legislature by both Parliament and the Commission followed.&lt;ref name=ECflowchart/&gt;

MiFID was introduced under the [[Lamfalussy process|Lamfalussy procedure]], which was designed to accelerate the adoption of legislation based on a [[four-level approach]] recommended by the [[Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets|Committee of Wise Men]]. The Committee was chaired by Baron [[Alexandre Lamfalussy]]. There are three other "Lamfalussy Directives," including the Prospectus Directive, the Market Abuse Directive and the Transparency Directive.&lt;ref name=Skinner07&gt;{{cite book |title=The Future of Investing in Europe's Markets after MiFID |author=Chris Skinner |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZv3z9Y5CI4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MiFID Level 1 Directive 2004/39/EC, implemented through the standard [[co-decision procedure]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], and the [[European Parliament]], sets out a detailed framework for the legislation.&lt;ref name="directive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="comreg"/&gt; It also amends Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC and repeals Council Directive 93/22/EEC, Investment Services Directive (ISD) originally adopted in 1993.&lt;ref name=L1D04&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1398325978410&amp;uri=CELEX:02004L0039-20110104 |title=MiFID Level 1 Directive 2004/39/EC |date=21 April 2004 |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level 2===
Twenty articles of this directive specified technical implementation measures (Level 2). These measures were adopted by the [[European Commission]], based on technical advice from the [[Committee of European Securities Regulators]] and negotiations in the [[European Securities Committee]] with oversight by the [[European Parliament]]. Implementation measures in the form of a Commission Directive and Commission Regulation were officially published on 2 September 2006.&lt;ref name="directive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="comreg"/&gt;

==Contents==
===Scope===
To determine which firms are affected by MiFID and which are not, MiFID distinguishes between "investment services and activities" ("core" services) and "ancillary services" ("non-core" services). More detail on the services in each category can be found in Annex 1 Sections A and B of the MiFID Level 1 Directive.

If a firm performs investment services and activities, it is subject to MiFID in respect both of these and also of ancillary services (and it can use the MiFID passport to provide them to member states other than its home state). However, if a firm only performs ancillary services, it is not subject to MiFID (but nor can it benefit from the MiFID passport).

MiFID covers almost all tradable financial products with the exception of certain foreign exchange trades. This includes commodity and other derivatives such as [[Shipping markets#freight derivatives|freight]], [[Weather derivative|climate]] and [[Energy derivative|carbon derivatives]], which were not covered by ISD.

That part of a firm's business that is not covered by the above is not subject to MiFID.

Celent, a financial services consultancy, estimated in 2007 that under MiFID, the three largest EU jurisdictions—France, (Germany), and the UK—would require publication of over 100 million additional trades annually, with spending increasing as well but at a slower rate, from €38&amp;nbsp;million yearly to close to €50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reports.celent.com/PressReleases/20070123/MiFIDPostTrade.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610221727/http://reports.celent.com/PressReleases/20070123/MiFIDPostTrade.asp |date=10 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substance===
;Authorisation, regulation and passporting: Firms covered by MiFID will be authorised and regulated in their "home state" (broadly, the country in which they have their registered office). Once a firm has been authorised, it will be able to use the MiFID passport to provide services to customers in other EU member states. These services will be regulated by the member state in their "home state" (whereas currently under ISD, a service is regulated by the member state in which the service takes place).

;Client categorisation: MiFID requires firms to categorise clients as "eligible counterparties", professional clients or retail clients (these have increasing levels of protection). Clear procedures must be in place to categorise clients and assess their suitability for each type of investment product. That said, the appropriateness of any investment advice or suggested financial transaction must still be verified before being given.

;Client order handling: MiFID has requirements relating to the information that needs to be captured when accepting client orders, ensuring that a firm is acting in a client's best interests and as to how orders from different clients may be aggregated.

;Pre-trade transparency: MiFID will require that operators of continuous order-matching systems must make aggregated order information on "liquid shares" available at the five best price levels on the buy and sell side; for quote-driven markets, the best bids and offers of market makers must be made available. (Note consideration is being given to extending these requirements to other financial instruments. Under Article 65(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC, the European Commission is due to submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on extending pre- and post-trade transparency requirements to transactions in financial instruments other than shares by October 2007.)

;Post-trade transparency: MiFID will require firms to publish the price, volume and time of all trades in listed shares, even if executed outside of a regulated market, unless certain requirements are met to allow for deferred publication. (Note see comment above regarding extension of these requirements to other financial instruments).

;Inducements and investment research: One of the most controversial aspects of MiFID II is that it severely restricts asset managers' ability to obtain investment research with client commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars, MiFID II and Other Trading Activities,'' §§11:4 – 11:7 (Thomson West, 2017–2018 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

;Best execution: MiFID II will require that firms take all sufficient steps to obtain the best possible result in the execution of an order for a client. The [[Best execution|best possible result]] is not limited to execution price but also includes cost, speed, likelihood of execution and likelihood of settlement and any other factors deemed relevant.  MiFID II's "all sufficient steps" test sets a somewhat higher standard than the previous "all reasonable steps" standard in MiFID.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars, MiFID II and Other Trading Activities,'' §11:8 (Thomson West, 2017–2018 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

;Systematic Internaliser: A Systematic Internaliser is a firm that executes orders from its clients against its own book or against orders from other clients. MiFID will treat Systematic Internalisers as mini-exchanges, hence, for example, they will be subject to pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements (see above).

==Market fragmentation==
Although MiFID was intended to increase transparency for prices, the fragmentation of [[trading venue]]s has had an unanticipated effect. Where once a financial institution was able to see information from just one or two exchanges, they now have the possibility (and in some cases the obligation) to collect information from a multitude of [[Multilateral trading facility|multilateral trading facilities]], Systematic Internalisers and other exchanges from around the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). This results in an additional amount of work to benefit from the transparency that MiFID has introduced.

The number of additional pricing sources introduced by MiFID means that financial institutions have had to seek additional data sources to ensure that they capture as many quotes/trades as possible. Numerous [[financial data vendors]] have worked with the MiFID Joint Working Group and Regulators to make sure that they are able to help financial institutions to deal with the fragmentation and benefit from the increased transparency, while helping them to fulfill their new reporting liabilities.

==Transposition==

MiFID and its accompanying implementing directive were [[Transposition (law)|transposed]] in full and on time, with minor exceptions. The European Commission has published a transposition table linking to lists of national provisions which transpose directives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_implementation_en.htm MiFID Transposition state of play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008172000/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_implementation_en.htm |date=8 October 2011 }} European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA), now the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA), was the body responsible for regulation of the securities industry in the United Kingdom during the period of implementation. It incorporated MiFID into its Handbook of rules and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsa.gov.uk/about/what/international/mifid Review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II)] Government of the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
The French government has implemented MiFID by modifying the French Monetary and Financial Code, in particular by ordinance number 2007-544 of 12 April 2007, and the decrees 2007-901 and 2007-904 of 15 May 2007. The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) has also applied MiFID to its General Regulations (''Règlement Général'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amf-france.org/documents/general/7839_1.pdf MiFID implementation in France]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} AMF-France.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==MiFID II/MiFIR==
In April 2010 [[Committee of European Securities Regulators|CESR]] issued consultation papers on MiFID review.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesr.eu/index.php?page=consultation&amp;mac=0&amp;id= |title=NetNames : Noms de domaine |publisher=Cesr.eu |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation period was short and ended on 31 May 2010. There was one day of open hearings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesr.eu/index.php?page=hearings&amp;mac=0&amp;id= |title=NetNames : Noms de domaine |publisher=Cesr.eu |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris on 17 May 2010. Public responses to the consultations are now available&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; although a number of institutions also submitted confidential responses.

On 8 December 2010, following a public hearing held in September 2010, the European Commission released a substantial public consultation relating to the review of MiFID (MiFID II), accompanied by a press release and frequently asked questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_en.htm Investment Services Directive – Markets in Financial Instruments Directive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321191440/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_en.htm |date=21 March 2011 }} 20 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The public consultation period was scheduled to close on 2 February 2011. On 26 May 2011, the Commission was reported to be working to present its proposals before the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/47044528-8797-11e0-af98-00144feabdc0.html Quick View: Are Emir and MiFID now delayed?] 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2011, the European Commission adopted formal proposals for a "Directive on markets in financial instruments repealing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council" (MiFID II Directive), and for a "Regulation on markets in financial instruments (MiFIR)", which would also amend the proposed [[European Market Infrastructure Regulation]] (EMIR) on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and [[Trade Repository|trade repositories]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_en.htm FT: Mifid amendment calls for commission ban to be scrapped] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321191440/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_en.htm |date=21 March 2011 }} 29 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, MEP [[Markus Ferber]] suggested amendments to the European Commission's proposals, intended to strengthen restrictions on [[high-frequency trading]] and commodity price manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Both MiFID II and MiFIR entered into force on 2 July 2014.  The initial date for implementation by the Member States was 3 January 2017, however, in February 2016 the European Commission delayed this until 3 January 2018 to allow for the building of IT systems to enable enforcement of the new package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Some banks and institutions advocated for a further delay to the implementations of MiFID II, with smaller organisations not yet equipped for the additional demands.&lt;ref name="FTmifidII"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stafford|first1=Philip|last2=Noonan|first2=Laura|last3=Murphy|first3=Hannah|title=Banks lobby for reprieve on key part of Mifid II rules|url=https://www.ft.com/content/89cb1f24-e011-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c|accessdate=19 December 2017|work=Financial Times|publisher=Nikkei Company|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, MiFID II came into force on the revised date of 3 January 2018.

Some analysts believe the impact of MiFID II will lead to global investment research expenditures falling by as much as $1.5bn annually when the rules come into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearlman|first1=Elisabeth|title=Banks want to delay a key part of the Mifid II legislation ahead of next month's deadline|url=https://www.verdict.co.uk/banks-mifid-ii-legislation-lei/|accessdate=19 December 2017|work=Verdict UK|publisher=GlobalData PLC|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days of coming into effect, [[Intercontinental Exchange]] announced plans to transfer trading in 245 energy futures contracts from London to the US, putting transactions under the oversight of US, rather than European, regulators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/999ab1c4-f648-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|access-date=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
The '''Minister of Defence, Disarmament, and Veterans''' ({{fr|Minister de defense, desarmament et ancien combatattants}}) (MDNDAC) is a minister of the [[Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo government]] responsible for implementation of government defence policy and supervises the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Since 2015, the position has been held by {{ill|Crispin Atama Tabe|fr}}.

The President, Major General [[Joseph Kabila]] is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Defence ministers, formally Ministers of Defence, Disarmament, and Veterans (Ancien Combattants), since the post-2002 transition began have been:
*[[Jean-Pierre Ondekane]] (of the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma]] (RCD-G)), July 2003-January 2005&lt;ref&gt;[[Africa Confidential]], 'The Nearly Government,' 11 July 2003. Born 1 January 1962 (other sources say 1960 or 1961, he originated in Bakatola sector, Ingende territoire, [[Équateur (former province)|Equateur Province]]. Studied at [[Ecole de formation d'officiers]], Kananga, graduated 1988 with the grade of sub-lieutenant. Became an officer in the SARM, commanded several company-level units, but cleaved to [[AFDL]] during the civil war. Became commander of 10th Brigade in [[North Kivu]] 5 October 1997. Became vice-president of RCD-G on 24 January 1999, stationed later at [[Kisangani]]. On 30 June 2003 he was named as Minister of National Defence (RCD-G quota). Lost his post on 3 January 2005. Later named as the head of the [[Directorate General of Immigration]], which post he lost in 2008. Omasombo, 2009, 252-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurent-Desire Kabila]] was serving as his own minister of defence in October 1997,&lt;ref&gt;IRIN, http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Newsletters/irinw101397.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Kabila]] was doing the same while President in August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Africa South of the Sahara 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous defence ministers before 2003 included:
*Jerome Anany (1960s)
*Admiral [[Mavua Mudima]] (c.1994-97)

With these results, Sarajevska Pivara became one of the four leading companies in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

'''''The Shape of Things to Come''''' is a work of science fiction by [[H. G. Wells]], published in 1933, which speculates on future events from 1933 until the year 2106.

A long economic slump causes a major war that leaves Europe devastated and threatened by plague. The nations with the strongest air-forces set up a benevolent dictatorship that paves the way for [[world peace]] by abolishing national divisions, enforcing the English language, promoting scientific learning and outlawing religion. The enlightened world-citizens are able to depose the dictators peacefully, and go on to breed a new race of super-talents, able to maintain a permanent utopia.
 
Some of Wells’ short-term predictions would come true, notably the [[Aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombing of whole cities]] and the eventual development of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]. Others, such as the withering of state-power and the dissolution of [[Islam]] were wide off the mark.

==Plot==
As a [[frame story]], Wells claims that the book is his edited version of notes written by an eminent diplomat, Dr Philip Raven, who had been having dream visions of a history textbook published in 2106 and wrote down what he could remember of it. It is split into five separate sections or "books":
#Today and Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration Dawns – The history of the world up to 1933.
#The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration – 1933–1960.
#The World Renaissance: The Birth of the Modern State – 1960–1978.
#The Modern State Militant – 1978–2059.
#The Modern State in Control of Life – 2059 to New Year's Day 2106.

''The Shape of Things to Come'' was written as a [[future history]]. In late 1933 or early 1934, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s failure to implement the [[New Deal]] and revive the US economy and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failure to revive the German economy by [[German re-armament|rearmament]]. Which causes the worldwide [[Great Depression|economic crisis]] to continue for thirty years, concurrently with the war, as described above.

Wells predicted a [[Second World War]] breaking out with a European conflagration from the flashpoint of a violent clash between Germans and Poles at [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]]. Wells set the date for this as January 1940 – quite close to the actual date of September 1939. But where Wells' imagined war sharply diverges from the actual WWII is in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] proving a military match for [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] – and they engage in an inconclusive war lasting ten years. More countries are eventually dragged into the fighting, but [[Third French Republic|France]] and the [[Soviet Union]] are only marginally involved, the [[United Kingdom]] remains neutral, and the [[United States]] fights inconclusively with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. The Austrian ''[[Anschluss]]'' happens during, rather than before, the war. [[Czechoslovakia]] avoids German occupation and its president, [[Edvard Beneš]], survives to initiate the final "Suspension of Hostilities" in 1950.

Wells' prediction was widely off the mark with regard to [[Spain]], which the book assumed would manage to stay away from the violent passions sweeping the rest of Europe – where in fact the [[Spanish Civil War]] would become the main focus of these passions, two years after ''Shape of Things to Come'' was published. Evidently, Wells greatly overestimated the influence of Spanish Liberals such as [[Unamuno]] on Spanish society as a whole.

Wells correctly predicted that the coming war would involve both sides launching heavy bombings of each other's main cities (his detailed depiction of the destroyed [[Unter Den Linden]] closely predicted the boulevard's actual fate in the war). However, Wells was wrong in assuming that land fighting would quickly bog down as in [[World War I]], and that the idea of using [[tank]]s to develop a [[Maneuver warfare|war of movement]]  would come to naught. Wells predicted that [[submarine]]s would become the launching pads for "air torpedos" (i.e. [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|missiles]]) carrying [[weapons of mass destruction]], enabling a country to threaten the destruction of places halfway around the world – which actually happened, though not in World War II but decades later.

Wells' predicted war ends with no victor but total exhaustion, collapse and disintegration of all the fighting states and of the neutral countries, equally affected by the deepening economic crisis. The whole world descends into chaos: nearly all governments break down, and a devastating [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1956 and 1957 kills a large part of humanity and almost destroys civilisation.

Wells then envisages a [[benevolent dictatorship]], "The Dictatorship of the Air", arising from the controllers of the world's surviving transport systems, who are the only people with global power. This dictatorship promotes [[science]], enforces [[Basic English]] as a global [[lingua franca]] and eradicates all [[religion]]s, setting the world on the road to a peaceful [[utopia]]. When the dictatorship chooses to murder a subject, the condemned person is given a chance to take a poison tablet (modeled on the [[Apiaceae|Hemlock]] given to [[Socrates]]).

The achievement of a [[classless society]] is not via a Marxist [[Dictatorship of the Proletariat]], an idea which Wells completely rejected. Rather, the [[working class]] is massively "pulled upwards" and completely eliminated in several generations of intensive [[upward social mobility]] – in effect leaving a humanity entirely composed of "middle class intellectuals". The limited amount of physical labor still needed is performed by the world's youths, undergoing two years of "labor conscription" instead of the no longer needed military conscription.

Eventually, after about 100 years of reshaping humanity, the Dictatorship of the Air is overthrown in a completely bloodless [[coup]], the former rulers are sent into a very honourable retirement, and the world state "withers away". The last part of the book is a detailed description of the utopian world that emerges.  The ultimate aim of this utopian world is to produce a world society composed entirely of [[polymath]]s, each and every one of its members the intellectual equal of the greatest geniuses of the past.

The book displays one of the earliest uses of the abbreviation "C.E.", which Wells explains as "[[Christian Era]]", but it is now more usually understood as "[[Common Era]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wells | first = HG | chapter-url = http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301391h.html#i01 | at = §1. A Chronological Note | chapter = Introduction | title = The Shape of Things to Come | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg Australia]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppression of religions==
One of the major aspects of the creation of the World State is the abolition of all organised religion—an act deemed indispensable to give the emerging "Modern State" a monopoly over education and the complete ability to mould new generations of humanity.

The abolition of [[Islam]] is carried out by the Air Police, who "descend upon [[Mecca]] and close down the main holy places", apparently without major incident.  Eventually, Islam disappears, its demise accelerated by the decay of [[Arabic]] and its replacement by "an expanded English".  Some twenty mosques survive, deemed to be worthy of preservation on architectural grounds. The [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese-American]] scholar George Nasser remarked on this aspect of Wells' book: "In the 1979 imagined by HG Wells, a self-appointed ruling elite composed mainly of Westerners, with one Chinese and one Black African and not a single Arab member, would establish itself in the Arab and Muslim city of [[Basra]] and calmly take the decision to completely extinguish and extirpate the Muslim religion...  In the 1979 of real history, [[Khomeini]]'s [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] came into being".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Dr. George | last = Nasser | contribution = The Long Tortuous and Arrogant Road to 9/11, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5 | editor-first = Barbara | editor-last = Wheatley | title = The West and Islam, Islam and the West: Confrontation or Accommodation?}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only a brief reference to the abolition of [[Buddhism]] and no reference to any serious problem encountered by the Modern State in eradicating it from [[East Asia]].

The most prolonged and formidable religious opposition envisaged by Wells is from the [[Catholic Church]]. (There is little reference to [[Protestantism|Protestants]].) The [[Pope]] and the entire Catholic hierarchy are gassed unconscious when blessing the new aircraft built by a revived [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]]. After the Catholic Church is decisively crushed in Italy, it finds refuge in [[Ireland]], "the last bastion of [[Christianity]]". [[Ireland]] is also subdued, and then Catholic resistance is maintained only in [[Latin America]], under "a coloured Pope in [[Pernambuco]]", until it too is finally put down.

Wells gives considerable attention to the fate of the [[Jew]]s. In this history, an enfeebled [[Nazi Germany]] is incapable of systematic murder on the scale of the [[Holocaust]]. However, Jews greatly suffer from "unorganized" persecution, and there is a reference to anti-Jewish [[pogrom]]s happening "everywhere in Europe" during the chaotic 1950s. Then, in a world where all nation-states are a doomed anachronism, [[Zionism]] and its ambition to create a new state come to naught. In the later struggle between the emerging world state and its opponents, Jews are seen as caught between the hammer and the anvil. Following the launch of its antireligious campaign, the Modern State closes down all [[kosher]] butcheries still in operation, while the opening act of the "Federated Nationalist" rebels opposing this state is to perpetrate a pogrom against Jews in the [[Frankfurt]] area. Eventually, in Wells's vision, it is the Modern State's forced assimilation that triumphs and the Jews, who had resisted earlier such pressures, become completely absorbed in the general society and lose their separate identity.

==Democracy, Fascism and Communism==

In the 1930s, especially after the collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], the survival of European Democracy seemed in doubt. Wells - not a great supporter of Democracy  even in its more robust times - clearly   shared this outlook. The future history book, from the vantage point of 2106, notes that at the outbreak of war in 1940 [[France]] was ''still'' a [[Parliamentary Democracy]] - the implication clearly being that that was an outmoded form of government, on its way out. The visionary Gustave de Windt, setting out the blueprint for the coming "Modern State", rejects categorically "[[Opposition (parliamentary)|The Principle of Opposition]]"  - which by definition rules out Parliamentary Democracy.

Wells' posterity remembers [[Fascism]] more as a ridiculous and stupid movement than as a horrible one. In the war envisioned in the book, an enfeebled [[Nazi Germany]] got bogged down in its war with [[Poland]], never achieved vast conquests nor engaged in  [[The Holocaust|a systematic murder of Jews]], and finally collapsed and disintegrated (no mention is made of [[Hitler]]'s ultimate fate, and the historian of 2106 clearly considers it unimportant).

German Nazism disappears witout a trace, and an attempt to revive [[Italian Fascism]] is easily swept away by the resurgent Modern State. The book notes that many people who were Fascists or Nazis in their early years had become staunch adherents of the Modern State in the more mature part of their lives.

This posterity remembers [[Stalin]] as having been narrow and limited in his understanding, but not as a bloody dictator. The [[Soviet Union]] is less effected than other countries by the worldwide chaos and disintegration of the late 1940s and the 1950s. With the rise of the Modern State, Russia experiences a bloodless takeover by the pilots and other skilled technicians, who displace the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] bureaucrats and eagerly assimilate into the new worldwide state. In the transition time, the old [[Hammer and Sickle]] is displayed side by side with the Modern State's Winged Disk.

Altogether, of the three competing systems of government - Democracy, Fascism and Communism - only the last would be remembered by Wells' Modern State as having been to some degree a predecessor of itself.

==Relation to ''Brave New World''==
{{original research section|date=June 2018}}
''The Shape of Things to Come'' was published two years after [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. The two share the same basic outline of humanity's future – i.e., a massive war leaves the world in ruins, a self-appointed elite takes over, rebuilds the world and engages in very thorough [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to completely refashion human society. Wells explicitly acknowledges this relationship in the book itself; when the future history book discusses the "Dictatorship of the Air" and its leadership, it is noted that ''"As Aldous Huxley, one of the most brilliant of the reactionary writers, foretold of them, they tidied up the world"''.

The crucial difference, of course, is in the kind of future society built up in the two books. The future society envisioned by Huxley is rigidly hierarchical, divided into five psychologically-conditioned classes, ranging from the highly intelligent and assertive Alphas on top to the subservient and moronic Epsilons at the bottom. As Huxley's cynical administrator Mustafa Mond asserts, such moronic underclasses are absolutely essential as society's "gyroscope" – since a society composed entirely of the intelligent and assertive "Alphas" would inevitably collapse in all-out conflict, as each of its members would seek to improve his or her position at the expense of the others.

It was this vision which, in Wells' view, would cause Huxley to be remembered by posterity as a "reactionary writer". Much of ''Shape of Things to Come'' is devoted to demonstrating that – given a century-long dedicated and intensive work by an elite possessing complete control of world education – such a society of intelligent and assertive "Alphas" could be made harmonious and functional, with no underclasses under them.

==Adaptations==
Wells loosely adapted the novel for the screenplay of the film ''[[Things to Come]]'', produced by [[Alexander Korda]] and directed by [[William Cameron Menzies]], and released in 1936.  It also takes elements from Wells's non-fiction book ''[[The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind]]'' (1931). The film stars [[Raymond Massey]], [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Cedric Hardwicke]] and [[Margaretta Scott]].

''[[H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come]]'' is a Canadian science fiction motion picture first released in May 1979.  Although credited to [[H. G. Wells]], the film takes only its title and some character names from the original source material. The film's plot has no relationship to the events of the book. The film was an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of such recent successes as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', and TV series such as ''[[Space: 1999]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', although the film had only a fraction of the production budget of any of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/109740/The-Shape-of-Things-to-Come/overview | title = The Shape of Things to Come | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Big Finish Productions]] released a 2017 audio adaptation loosely based on the novel, adapted by [[Guy Adams]], starring [[Nicola Walker]] and [[Sam Troughton]] and directed by [[Lisa Bowerman]]. This version presents events as taking part in an alternate timeline which Raven is shown, rather than the dreams of the original novel.

==Influence on later science fiction==
Theodore Wein&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Theodore | last = Wein|  title = HG Wells and the Golden Age of Science Fiction |chapter = 1|page = 5,7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that "Wells' ''Things to Come'' was at its most influential in the six years between its publication and the moment when the course of its predicted war was overtaken and overshadowed by the actual fast-unfolding events of the Second World War. These same years of the 1930s were the time of incubation for the people who were destined to become the greatest names in Science Fiction, the time when they read ravenously any SF on which they could lay their hands and started to formulate their own ideas. It is not surprising that traces of ''Things to Come'' are clearly visible in what they wrote in the 1940s and 1950s." Among such great names of Golden Age Science Fiction, Wein noted [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Robert Heinlein]] and [[Poul Anderson]], and he enumerated in the work of all three – as well of some lesser known SF writers – some influences which could be traced to "Things to Come".

[[Rex Warner]]'s [[dystopian]] novel ''The Aerodrome'' (1941) is partly a fictional critique of ''The Shape of Things to Come'', with Wells' "Air Police" transformed into the [[fascism|fascistic]] "Airmen".&lt;ref&gt;" In a literary response to ''Things to Come'', Rex Warner's allegorical novel ''The Aerodrome'' (1941) is, alas, little known. Its Air Vice-Marshal, who rejects the human world as it is...proposes the training of "a new and more adequate race of men": the Wellsian program exactly". [[Leon Stover|Leon E. Stover]], ''Science Fiction From Wells To Heinlein''.  Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland, 2002. {{ISBN|0786412194}}  (p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells depicted the European social scientist Gustave De Windt sitting down at the [[British Museum Library]] and setting out the precise blueprint for a transformation of the world which he would not live to see. This, in Theodore Wein's opinion, may have inspired [[Hari Seldon]], [[Isaac Asimov]]'s well-known character. Wein noted: "Wells' De Windt, conducting his library research in London, capital of the declining British Empire, realized that the world was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Wells's book details how  De Windt's disciples, the Modern State Society, set about implementing De Windt's vision. Asimov's Seldon conducted  his library research in the Imperial Library of [[Trantor]], capital of the declining Galactic Empire. He realized that the Galaxy was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Asimov's Foundation Series details how  Seldon's disciples, the First Foundation and the Second one, set about implementing Seldon's vision.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Theodore | last = Wein | title = HG Wells and the Golden Age of Science Fiction | chapter = 3,4|page = 17,43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wein also points to Wells' "Encyclopaedic organization which centres upon Barcelona, with its seventeen million active workers" which is tasked with creating "the Fundamental Knowledge System which accumulates, sorts, keeps in order and renders available everything that is known" as a possible inspiration for Asimov's [[Encyclopedia Galactica]], whose compilation was the original task of the First Foundation and quotes from which are sprinkled throughout the Foundation Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Theodore | last = Wein | title = HG Wells and the Golden Age of Science Fiction | chapter = 4|pages = 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Wells had the planes of the emerging World State overfly [[Washington, D.C.]] and undermine the authority of the [[President of the United States]]. A decade later, the American [[Robert Heinlein]] wrote "[[Solution Unsatisfactory]]" in which planes of the International Patrol do the same. Later, Heinlein upgraded the International Patrol into an [[Space Cadet|Interplanetary Patrol]], a self-appointed elite of highly motivated and rather puritanical spacemen reminiscent of those enforcing Wells' "Dictatorship of the Air".

Wells depicted "Federated Nationalists" who had banded together only so that they could fly at each other's throats once they had smashed the budding world government. [[Poul Anderson]] in his early future history, the [[Psychotechnic League]], depicted precisely the same kind of Nationalists violently opposing the [[United Nations]]' efforts to make itself a true world government and rebuild the war-torn world.

In 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a [[personal union]] when [[James I of England|James VI, King of Scots]], inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious institutions.&lt;ref name="D.

In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|were involved in a series of connected wars]] (including the [[English Civil War]]) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short-lived [[unitary republic]] of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/187936/English-Civil-Wars |title=English Civil Wars |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/uk/scotland/01_laws.php |title=Scotland and the Commonwealth: 1651–1660 |publisher=Archontology.org |date=14 March 2010 |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th and 18th centuries, British sailors were involved in acts of [[piracy]] ([[privateering]]), attacking and stealing from ships off the coast of Europe and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCarthy |first1=Mathew |title=Privateering, Piracy and British Policy in Spanish America, 1810–1830 |date=2013 |publisher=The Boydell Press |location=Woodbridge |isbn=978-1843838616 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Restoration (1660)|monarchy was restored]], the [[Interregnum (1649–1660)|Interregnum]] ensured (along with the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and the subsequent [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]]) that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, [[royal absolutism]] would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne.

Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments

===Treaty of Union===
{{Main|History of the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Treaty of Union.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Treaty of Union]] led to a single united kingdom encompassing all Great Britain]]
On 1 May 1707, the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] came into being, the result of [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] being passed by the parliaments of England and Scotland to ratify the 1706 [[Treaty of Union]] and so unite the two kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/docs/articles_union.htm |title=Articles of Union with Scotland 1707 |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/ |title=Acts of Union 1707 |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk/union.html |title=Treaty (act) of Union 1706 |publisher=Scottish History online |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under [[Robert Walpole]], in practice the first prime minister (1721–1742). A series of [[Jacobite Uprisings]] sought to remove the Protestant [[House of Hanover]] from the British throne and restore the Catholic [[House of Stuart]]. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746, after which the [[Scottish Highlanders]] were brutally suppressed. The British colonies in North America that broke away from Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] became the [[United States of America]], recognised by Britain in 1783. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to [[Company rule in India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, [https://books.google.com/?id=BQDgr_XvsHoC&amp;pg=PA73 ''The Impact of the American Revolution Abroad''], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century, Britain was involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. British [[Slave ship|ships]] transported an estimated two million slaves from Africa to the West Indies. Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the [[blockade of Africa]] and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties. The world's oldest international human rights organisation, [[Anti-Slavery International]], was formed in London in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513171717/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=9462&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html "Anti-Slavery International"].

===Union with Ireland===
{{main|Acts of Union 1800}}
The term "United Kingdom" became official in 1801 when the parliaments of Britain and Ireland each passed an [[Acts of Union (1800)|Act of Union]], uniting the two kingdoms and creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actofunion.ac.uk/actofunion.htm#act |title=The Act of Union |publisher=Act of Union Virtual Library |accessdate=15 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|thumb|alt=Painting of a bloody battle. Horses and infantry fight or lie on grass.|The [[Battle of Waterloo]], 1815, marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the start of ''[[Pax Britannica]]'']]
In the early 19th century, the British-led [[Industrial Revolution]] began to transform the country. Gradually political power shifted away from the old [[Tory]] and [[Whiggism|Whig]] landowning classes towards the new industrialists. An alliance of merchants and industrialists with the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] would lead to a new party, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], with an ideology of [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]''. In 1832 Parliament passed the [[Great Reform Act]], which began the transfer of political power from the aristocracy to the middle classes. In the countryside, [[enclosure]] of the land was driving small farmers out. Towns and cities began to swell with a new urban working class. Few ordinary workers had the vote, and they created their own organisations in the form of trade unions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

After the defeat of France at the end of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1792–1815), Great Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830).&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, L.-N.

Social reform and home rule for Ireland were important domestic issues after 1900.

===Irish independence===
{{main|Anglo-Irish Treaty}}
The rise of [[Irish nationalism]], and disputes within Ireland over the terms of [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]], led eventually to the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;SR&amp;O 1921, No. 533 of 3 May 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Free State]] became independent, initially with [[Dominion|Dominion status]] in 1922, and [[Statute of Westminster 1931#Irish Free State|unambiguously independent in 1931]].

Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the war when the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] (1929–1932) occurred. This led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest in the 1930s, with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. A coalition government was formed in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, W. D. (2004). ''Capitalism, Culture, and Decline in Britain, 1750–1990''.

Britain entered the [[Second World War]] by declaring war on [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939 after Germany had invaded Poland. [[Winston Churchill]] became prime minister and head of a coalition government in 1940. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year of the war, Britain and its Empire continued the fight alone against Germany. In 1940, the [[Royal Air Force]] defeated the German [[Luftwaffe]] in a struggle for control of the skies in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during [[the Blitz]]. There were also eventual hard-fought victories in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], the [[North Africa campaign]] and the [[Burma campaign]]. British forces played an important role in the [[Normandy landings]] of 1944, achieved with its United States ally.

The UK was the third country to develop [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|a nuclear weapons arsenal]] (with its [[Operation Hurricane|first atomic bomb test]] in 1952), but the new post-war limits of Britain's international role were illustrated by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956.

In the decade-long process of [[European integration]], the UK was a founding member of the alliance called the [[Western European Union]], established with the [[London and Paris Conferences]] in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the [[European Communities]] (EC). When the EC became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding members. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, which forms the constitutional basis of the European Union since then.

From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally known as [[the Troubles]].

Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Conservative government of the 1980s]] under [[Margaret Thatcher]] initiated a radical policy of [[monetarism]], deregulation, particularly of the financial sector (for example, [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies ([[privatisation]]), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=British politics since 1945 |first=Peter |last=Dorey |year=1995 |pages=164–223 |isbn=978-0-631-19075-2 |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell |series=Making contemporary Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in high unemployment and social unrest, but ultimately also economic growth, particularly in the services sector.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative geography of the United Kingdom}}
The geographical division of the United Kingdom into [[Counties of the United Kingdom|counties]] or shires began in England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages and was complete throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period.&lt;ref&gt;Hackwood Frederick William: ''The Story of the Shire, Being the Lore, History and Evolution of English County Institutions'' (1851)&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative arrangements were developed separately in each country of the United Kingdom, with origins which often pre-dated the formation of the United Kingdom. Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient counties, was introduced separately: in England and Wales in a [[Local Government Act 1888|1888 act]], Scotland in a [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889|1889 act]] and Ireland in a [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898|1898 act]], meaning there is no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/9th-uncsgn-docs/report%20of%209th%20uncsgn%20n0750902%20en.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lhCIacyi?url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/9th-UNCSGN-Docs/E-CONF-98-48-Add1.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2009 |title=Ninth UN Conference on the standardization of Geographical Names |date=August 2007 |author=[[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] |publisher=UN Statistics Division |accessdate=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Local government in Scotland|local government purposes]], Scotland is divided into [[subdivisions of Scotland|32 council areas]], with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of [[Glasgow]], Edinburgh, [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] are separate council areas, as is the [[Politics of the Highland council area|Highland Council]], which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000&amp;nbsp;people.

Elections are conducted by [[single transferable vote]] in multi-member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a [[Provost (civil)|Provost]], or [[Chairman|Convenor]], to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area.

[[Local government in Wales]] consists of 22 unitary authorities.

The United Kingdom is a [[unitary state]] under a [[constitutional monarchy]]. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] and head of state of the UK, as well as fifteen other independent countries. These sixteen countries are sometimes referred to as "[[Commonwealth realm]]s". The monarch has "the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn".&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Bagehot|Bagehot, Walter]] (1867). ''The English Constitution''. London: Chapman and Hall. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]] is [[uncodified constitution|uncodified]] and consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources, including [[statute]]s, judge-made [[case law]] and international treaties, together with [[British Constitution#Conventions|constitutional conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm#UK%20Legal%20System |title=A Guide To the UK Legal System |publisher=[[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]] |accessdate=16 May 2006 |author=Carter, Sarah |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67yH6Ly5h?url=http://www.llrx.com/features/uk2.htm |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and "constitutional law", the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] can perform "constitutional reform" simply by passing [[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of Parliament]], and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution. However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/sovereignty.cfm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67yH6yA8K?url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/sovereignty.cfm |archivedate=27 May 2012 |title=Parliamentary sovereignty |publisher=UK Parliament |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
{{Main|Government of the United Kingdom}}
The UK has a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary government]] based on the [[Westminster system]] that has been emulated around the world: a legacy of the British Empire. The parliament of the United Kingdom meets in the [[Palace of Westminster]] and has two houses: an elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and an appointed [[House of Lords]]. All bills passed are given [[Royal Assent]] before becoming law.

The position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;Since the early twentieth century the prime minister has held the office of [[First Lord of the Treasury]], and in recent decades has also held the office of [[Minister for the Civil Service]].&lt;/ref&gt; the UK's [[head of government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Government, Prime Minister and Cabinet |website=Public services all in one place |publisher=[[Directgov]] |url=http://direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073444 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921004951/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073444 |archivedate=21 September 2012 |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; belongs to the person most likely to command the [[Confidence and supply|confidence]] of the House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. The prime minister chooses a cabinet and its members are formally appointed by the monarch to form [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]]. By convention, the monarch respects the prime minister's decisions of government.&lt;ref name="npm"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245682.stm |title=Brown is UK's new prime minister |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=23 January 2008 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building has several large towers, including large clock tower.|The [[Palace of Westminster]], seat of both houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]]
The [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] is traditionally drawn from members of the prime minister's party or coalition and mostly from the House of Commons but always from both legislative houses, the cabinet being [[responsible government|responsible]] to both. Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]], and become [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]]. The current Prime Minister is [[Theresa May]], who has been in office since 13 July 2016. May is also the leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. For elections to the House of Commons, the UK is divided into [[United Kingdom constituencies|650 constituencies]],&lt;ref name="Elections and voting—UK Parliament"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/ |title=Elections and voting |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=19 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uEkDvhFK?url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/ |date=14 November 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; each electing a single member of parliament (MP) by [[plurality voting system|simple plurality]]. [[Elections in the United Kingdom|General elections]] are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises.

The [[Scottish Government]] and [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]] have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically [[reserved matters|reserved]] to the UK Parliament, including [[education in Scotland|education]], [[NHS Scotland|healthcare]], [[Scots law]] and [[local government in Scotland|local government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/the_scottish_parliament/310036.stm |title=Scotland's Parliament&amp;nbsp;– powers and structures |publisher=BBC News |date=8 April 1999 |accessdate=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the UK and Scottish governments signed the [[Edinburgh Agreement (2012)|Edinburgh Agreement]] setting out the terms for a [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on Scottish independence]] in 2014, which was defeated 55.3% to 44.7%.&lt;ref name=bbc-result&gt;{{cite news |title=Scotland Votes No |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/results |accessdate=4 August 2017 |agency=BBC News |date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Welsh Government]] and the [[National Assembly for Wales]] have more limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/wales_99/the_welsh_assembly/309033.stm |title=Structure and powers of the Assembly |publisher=BBC News |date=9 April 1999 |accessdate=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through [[Act of the National Assembly for Wales|Acts of the Assembly]], which require no prior consent from Westminster.

The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Assembly]] have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a [[diarchy]] representing [[Designated Unionist|unionist]] and [[Designated Nationalist|nationalist]] members of the Assembly.&lt;ref name="northernireland1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.northernireland.gov.uk/topics/your-executive |title=Your Executive |publisher=Northern Ireland Executive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devolution to Northern Ireland is contingent on participation by the Northern Ireland administration in the [[North-South Ministerial Council]], where the Northern Ireland Executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the [[Government of Ireland]]. The British and Irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting Northern Ireland through the [[British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference]], which assumes the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland administration in the event of its non-operation.

The UK does not have a [[codified constitution]] and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burrows |first=N. |doi=10.1111/1468-2230.00203 |title=Unfinished Business: The Scotland Act 1998 |journal=The Modern Law Review |volume=62 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=241–60 [p. 249] |quote=The UK Parliament is sovereign and the Scottish Parliament is subordinate.

Although the Agreement makes the general proviso that Westminster's 'powers to make legislation for Northern Ireland' remains 'unaffected', without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters, it may be more difficult than in Scotland or Wales for devolved powers to be repatriated. The retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in Northern Ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of parliamentary sovereignty but also the renegotiation of an intergovernmental agreement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scotland'''
{{Main|Education in Scotland}}
[[Education in Scotland]] is the responsibility of the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning]], with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility of Local Authorities. Two [[Scottish public bodies|non-departmental public bodies]] have key roles in Scottish education. The [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] is responsible for the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, [[Tertiary education|post-secondary]] colleges of [[further education]] and other centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/5656.html |title=About SQA |publisher=Scottish Qualifications Authority |date=10 April 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]] provides advice, resources and staff development to education professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/aboutlts/index.asp |title=About Learning and Teaching Scotland |publisher=Learning and Teaching Scotland |date= |accessdate=28 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401140609/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/aboutlts/index.asp |archivedate=1 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in 1496.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/education/e_brain_drain.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204064525/http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/education/e_brain_drain.html |archivedate=4 December 2007 |title=Brain drain in reverse |publisher=Scotland Online Gateway |date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just over 4% in 2016, but it has been falling slowly in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scis.org.uk/facts-and-figures/|title= Facts and Figures |publisher= SCIS |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish students who attend [[Scottish universities]] pay neither [[tuition fees]] nor graduate endowment charges, as fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment scheme was abolished in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7268101.stm |title=MSPs vote to scrap endowment fee |publisher=BBC News |date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wales'''
{{Main|Education in Wales}}
The [[Welsh Government]] has responsibility for [[education in Wales]]. A significant number of Welsh students are taught either wholly or largely in the [[Welsh language]]; lessons in Welsh are compulsory for all until the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Education System |url=http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/english/live/education_system/education_system.aspx |publisher=Welsh Government |accessdate=9 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312105509/http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/English/Live/Education_system/Education_system.aspx |archivedate=12 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans to increase the provision of Welsh-medium schools as part of the policy of creating a fully bilingual Wales.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

'''Northern Ireland'''
{{Main|Education in Northern Ireland}}
[[Education in Northern Ireland]] is the responsibility of the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Education]], although responsibility at a local level is administered by the [[Education Authority]] which is further sub-divided into five geographical areas. The [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment]] (CCEA) is the body responsible for advising the [[Northern Ireland Executive|government]] on what should be taught in Northern Ireland's schools, monitoring standards and awarding qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CCEA |url=http://www.ccea.org.uk/ |title=About Us&amp;nbsp;– What we do |publisher=Council for the Curriculum Examinations &amp; Assessment |date= |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a [[devolution|devolved matter]] and each country has its own system of private and [[publicly funded health care]], together with [[alternative medicine|alternative]], holistic and complementary treatments. Public healthcare is provided to all [[British nationality law|UK permanent residents]] and is mostly free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The [[World Health Organization]], in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world.&lt;ref name="Who2000"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Haden |editor-first=Angela |editor2-last=Campanini |editor2-first=Barbara |title=The world health report 2000&amp;nbsp;– Health systems: improving performance |year=2000 |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organisation |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |isbn=978-92-4-156198-3 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wgreene/Statistics/WHO-COMP-Study-30.pdf |title=Measuring overall health system performance for 191 countries |author=[[World Health Organization]] |publisher=New York University |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has been increased significantly to bring it closer to the European Union average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.healthp.org/node/71 |title=The NHS from Thatcher to Blair |first=Peter |last=Fisher |journal=NHS Consultants Association |quote=The Budget&amp;nbsp;... was even more generous to the NHS than had been expected amounting to an annual rise of 7.4% above the rate of inflation for the next 5 years. This would take us to 9.4% of GDP spent on health ie around EU average.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK spends around 8.4% of its gross domestic product on healthcare, which is 0.5 percentage points below the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] average and about one percentage point below the average of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/BriefingNoteUNITEDKINGDOM2012.pdf |title=OECD Health Data 2012&amp;nbsp;– How Does the United Kingdom Compare |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |location=Paris |date= |accessdate=9 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310214914/http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/BriefingNoteUNITEDKINGDOM2012.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the [[General Medical Council]], the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] and non-governmental-based, such as the [[Royal College]]s. However, political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four national [[executive (government)|executives]]; [[healthcare in England]] is the responsibility of the UK Government; [[healthcare in Northern Ireland]] is the responsibility of the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]; [[healthcare in Scotland]] is the responsibility of the [[Scottish Government]]; and [[healthcare in Wales]] is the responsibility of the [[Welsh Government]]. Each [[National Health Service]] has different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7586147.stm |title='Huge contrasts' in devolved NHS |publisher=BBC News |date=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm |title=NHS now four different systems |publisher=BBC News |date=2 January 2008 |first=Nick |last=Triggle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the United Kingdom}}
The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced by many factors including: the nation's island status; its [[History of the United Kingdom|history]] as a western liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a [[political union]] of four countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and symbolism. As a result of the [[British Empire]], British influence can be observed in the [[English language|language]], [[Culture of the United Kingdom|culture]] and [[Common law|legal systems]] of many of its former colonies including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and the United States. The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led it to be described as a "cultural superpower".&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;[http://www.britishpoliticssociety.no/British%20Politics%20Review%2001_2011.pdf "The cultural superpower: British cultural projection abroad"].

===Philosophy===
{{Main|British philosophy}}
The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of 'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy', sometimes referred to as the '[[Scottish School of Common Sense]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.rrbltd.co.uk/bibliographies/scottish_v5_bibliog.pdf |title=A bibliography of Scottish common sense philosophy: Sources and origins |accessdate=17 December 2010 |editor=Fieser, James |publisher=Thoemmes Press |location=Bristol |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous philosophers of British Empiricism are [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]]{{refn|group=note|Berkeley is in fact Irish but was called a 'British empiricist' due to the territory of what is now known as the [[Republic of Ireland]] being in the UK at the time}} and [[David Hume]]; while [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]] were major exponents of the Scottish "common sense" school. Two Britons are also notable for a theory of moral philosophy [[utilitarianism]], first used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and later by [[John Stuart Mill]] in his short work ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s7y5MJOuN30C&amp;pg=PA66 |title=Moral Problems in Medicine: A Practical Coursebook |author=Palmer, Michael |publisher=Lutterworth Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-7188-2978-0 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8A4xLnzfqYwC&amp;pg=PA82 |title=Utilitarianism |author=Scarre, Geoffrey |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1995 |page=82 |isbn=978-0-415-12197-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other eminent philosophers from the UK and the states and countries that preceded it include [[Duns Scotus]], [[John Lilburne]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred Jules Ayer|A.J.

Major sports, including association football, [[tennis]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[golf]], [[boxing]], [[netball]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[cricket]], originated or were substantially developed in the UK and the states that preceded it. With the rules and codes of many modern sports invented and codified in late 19th century [[Victorian Britain]], in 2012, the President of the IOC, [[Jacques Rogge]], stated; "This great, sports-loving country is widely recognised as the birthplace of modern sport. It was here that the concepts of sportsmanship and fair play were first codified into clear rules and regulations. It was here that sport was included as an educational tool in the school curriculum".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Games_London_2012/London_2012_Opening_ceremony_Speech_Jacques_Rogge.pdf "Opening ceremony of the games of the XXX Olympiad"].

In most international competitions, separate teams represent England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland usually field a single team representing all of Ireland, with notable exceptions being association football and the [[Commonwealth Games]]. In sporting contexts, the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish / Northern Irish teams are often referred to collectively as the [[Home Nations]]. There are some sports in which a single team represents the whole of United Kingdom, including the Olympics, where the UK is represented by the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain team]]. The [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] Summer Olympics were held in London, making it the first city to host the games three times.

[[Britannia]] is a [[national personification]] of the United Kingdom, originating from [[Roman Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.24carat.co.uk/britanniaframe.html |title=Britannia on British Coins |publisher=Chard |accessdate=25 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair, wearing a [[Corinthian helmet]] and white robes. She holds [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident and a shield, bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as riding on the back of a lion.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Since the height of the British Empire in the late 19th century, Britannia has often been associated with British maritime dominance, as in the patriotic song "[[Rule, Britannia!]]".{{cn|date=September 2018}} Up until 2008, the lion symbol was depicted behind Britannia on the [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|British fifty pence coin]] and on the back of the [[Ten pence (British decimal coin)|British ten pence coin]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the British Army.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

A second, less used, personification of the nation is the character [[John Bull]]. The [[bulldog]] is sometimes used as a symbol of the United Kingdom and has been associated with Winston Churchill's defiance of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Baker |first=Steve |title=Picturing the Beast |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2001 |page=52 |isbn=978-0-252-07030-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
