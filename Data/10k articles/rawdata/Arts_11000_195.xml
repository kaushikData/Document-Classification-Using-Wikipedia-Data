:''This article is about the ancient type of pottery. For the as yet unidentified ancient Egyptian city, see [[Amarna#Name]].''

An '''alabastron''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|b|æ|s|t|r|ə|n|,_|-|ˌ|t|r|ɒ|n}} or '''alabastrum''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|b|æ|s|t|r|ə|m}} ( plural: ''alabastra'' or ''alabastrons''; from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀλάβαστρον)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)la/bastron|ἀλάβαστρον|ref|mLSJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a small type of [[pottery]] or glass vessel used in the ancient world for holding oil, especially [[perfume]] or [[massage#Oil|massage oils]]. They originated around the 11th century BC in [[ancient Egypt]] as containers carved from [[alabaster]] &amp;ndash; hence the name &amp;ndash; but spread via [[ancient Greece]] to other parts of the classical world.

Most types of alabastron have a narrow body with a rounded end, a narrow neck and a broad, splayed mouth. They were often left without handles, but some types were equipped with ear-shaped projections or [[Lug (knob)|lug]]s into which holes were punched. Strings were then put through these holes for easy mobility.

The design of the first Egyptian alabastra was inspired by the [[palm tree]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} with a columnar shape, a palm capital and a stand. Later designs were made from [[glass]] decorated with various patterns, such as [[scallop]]s, festoons or abstract patterns of rings or zigzags.

Around the 7th century BC, alabastra spread to Greece and became an important element of [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|ancient Greek pottery]]. There were three distinct types of Greek alabastron:{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

* A basic [[Corinth]]ian bulbous shape standing about {{convert|3|-|4|in}} tall; a popular design found throughout Greece.
* A long and pointed version commonly seen in eastern Greek, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], and Italo-[[Corinth]]ian pottery.
* An [[Attica|Attic]] type about {{convert|4|-|8|in|cm}} long with a rounded base and lugs for carrying purposes.

Alabastra also appeared in many other places in the ancient world, notably [[Assyria]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]],&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 26:7&lt;/ref&gt; all having presumably been inspired by or exported from Greece or Egypt.

Within a hundred years after arriving in the area,{{Which|date=February 2012}} Greek artisans were producing elaborately decorated silver alabastra, long and narrow and {{convert|12|-|16|cm|sp=us}} in height.  The decoration usually involved dividing the body of the vase into four horizontal zones by ornamental bands around it.

[[Image:Divadloarena.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Divadlo Aréna]]

'''Arena Theatre''' ({{lang-sk|Divadlo Aréna}}) is one of the oldest theatres in [[Bratislava]]. 
It was established in 1828 on the right bank of [[Danube]]. In the beginning it served as 
an open summer [[amphitheatre]], hence the name Arena. The current building was built in 
1898.

From its establishment till the end of the [[Second World War]], many [[Hungary|Hungarian]], 
[[Austria]]n and [[Germany|German]] theatre companies performed there. After the war, the 
theatre was gradually closed and served as a storehouse for state-owned Slovak Television.

The theatre was revived by a group of people around [[Mime artist|mime]] artist [[Milan Sládek]], opening performance 
took place in 1997. The repertoire consisted of several pantomimic performances, an annual 
pantomimic festival took place there.

In 2003, renowned Slovak actor [[Juraj Kukura]] became managing director and focus of the 
theatre shifted to drama. Performance ''[[The Goat or Who is Sylvia?]]''&lt;ref&gt;co-production with [[Prague]]-based [[The Drama Club (Prague)|The Drama Club]]&lt;/ref&gt; was nominated 
for [[Dosky Awards|DOSKY Award]] 2004 in categories best performance and best director, Juraj 
Kukura and [[Emília Vášáryová]] won the categories for best actor/actress. A year later, 
monodrama ''Tiso'' was voted the best performance. [[Marián Labuda]], who was performing 
[[Jozef Tiso]], won the prize for best actor.

An '''artist collective''' is an initiative that is the result of a group of [[artist]]s working together, usually under their own [[management]], towards shared aims. The aims of an artist collective can include almost anything that is relevant to the needs of the [[artist]], this can range from purchasing bulk [[List of artistic media|materials]], sharing equipment, space or materials, through to following shared [[ideologies]], [[aesthetic]] and [[politics|political]] views or even living and working together as an [[extended family]]. Sharing of ownership, risk, benefits, and status is implied, as opposed to other, more common business structures with an explicit hierarchy of ownership such as an [[Voluntary association|association]] or a [[company]].

==Overview==
Artist collectives have occurred throughout history, often gathered around central resources, for instance the ancient sculpture workshops at the marble quarries on [[Milos]] in Greece and [[Carrara]] in Italy. Collectives featured during both the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]] when they were set up by the state in all major communities, and the [[French Revolution]] when the [[Louvre]] in Paris was occupied as an artist collective.

More traditional artist collectives tend to be smallish groups of two to eight artists who produce work, either collaboratively or as individuals toward exhibiting together in [[Art gallery|gallery]] shows or public spaces. Often an artists collective will maintain a collective space, for exhibiting or as workshop or studio facilities. Some newer, more experimental kinds of groups include intentional networks, anonymous, connector, hidden or nested groups, and groups with unconventional time-scales.  Artist collectives may be formed: For economic reasons, to give members volume purchasing power and allow costs of publicity and shows to be shared. For political reasons, to increase local lobbying power for arts infrastructure, to gather behind a cause or belief. For professional reasons, to develop a higher group profile that benefits the individuals by association, to create a hub for curators and commissioners to more easily locate potential talent.

'''''Broek in Waterland''''' is an 1889 [[oil painting]] by [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Indonesia|Indonesian]] artist [[Jan Toorop]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It is a [[pointillist]] image of the Dutch village of [[Broek in Waterland]] at twilight.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
After [[Seurat|Seurat's]] work premiered in [[Brussels]] in 1887, Toorop eagerly added those methods to his own repertoire. He became the most influential Dutch [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]], although his canvases in that style are rare and he frequently ignored that school's tenants, particularly the color principles. Their pointillist brushwork he used more readily, as in this painting. The couple gliding through the water may reflect his empathy for working men and women, a common Neo-Impressionist sentiment.

Toorop gave this landscape a very strong, geometrical structure. The sharply receding diagonals of the canals are echoed by the naked trunks of the pollard willows. These intersect with the ribbons of color in the sunset, its rosy hues firmly contrasting with the deep blues and greens of the landscape below.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt; ''Broek in Waterland'' was once coveted by the director of the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen|Boymans Museum]], who lauded its "'simple, usually disciplined structure,' 'distinction,' and controlled 'rhythmic composition.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopmans|first=Anita|title=Disputed Ownership: on the provenance of two works by Jan Toorop in the Boymans Museum|url=http://www.boijmans.nl/upload/File/toorop%20web%20UK.pdf|publisher=[[Netherlands Institute for Art History]]|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Historical information==
In February 1889, Toorop traveled to Broek in Waterland with [[Emile Verhaeren]], the Belgian poet and critic. Later that year, he painted this vivid image of the picturesque village, whose beauty had drawn emperors and tsars for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broek in Waterland|url=http://www.jan-toorop.com/artwork/1889/30|publisher=Jan Toorop Research Center|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Broek in Waterland'' was acquired by the IMA in 2002 as a gift in memory of Robert S. Ashby by his family and friends. It currently hangs in the Robert H. &amp; Ina M. Mohlman Gallery and has the acquisition number 2002.156.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Broek in Waterland|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/broek-waterland-toorop-jan|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crosby's Opera House''' (1865–1871) was an [[opera house]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States. It was founded by Uranus H. Crosby in 1865 in an effort to bring a great opera hall to the city. The building was designed by [[William W. Boyington]]; the great expense of its construction ruined Crosby. After holding only occasional performances, an association formed to relieve the house of its great debt. A lottery was held that distributed over 210,000 tickets, awarding purchasers great works of art and even the building itself. After it was sold back to Crosby by the lottery winner, the hall saw more consistent performances. The hall hosted the [[1868 Republican National Convention]]. It was destroyed in the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 and never rebuilt.

==History==
Uranus Harold Crosby came to Chicago from [[Chatham, Massachusetts]], on September 4, 1850. He did so on recommendation of his cousin Albert, who insisted that the city was well-cultured. Albert had arrived two years earlier to establish a liquor and tea trading house, Albert Crosby &amp; Co. In 1851, the cousins established a liquor manufactory and the operation became the largest wholesale distributor of distilled alcohol and [[camphine]].&lt;ref name=Crosby&gt;{{cite book|title=Crosby's Opera House: Symbol of Chicago's Cultural Awakening|last=Crosby|first=Eugene H.|year=1999|publisher=Associated University Presses|place=Cranbury, NJ|pp=27&amp;ndash;40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his new-found wealth, Uranus Crosby was disappointed at the lack of culture that he was promised in Chicago. The growing city could offer little more than [[brothel]]s, saloons, and gambling houses for entertainment. The one theater, built by [[John Blake Rice]] in 1847, was destroyed in a fire shortly before Crosby's arrival. When Rice rebuilt the theater in 1851, Crosby was disappointed that he showed little interest in exhibiting [[opera]] performances. [[James Hubert McVicker]], a close friend of Crosby's who was a neighbor in the Briggs House hotel, built a playhouse. Crosby probably assisted McVicker with raising credit for the institution.&lt;ref name=Crosby/&gt;

By 1855, Rice had retired from the theater business, leaving his theater a house of novelty shows. [[McVicker's Theater]] became the cultural center of Chicago entertainment, but Crosby believed that the city was overdue for a grand [[opera house]] like the ones he knew back East.&lt;ref name=Crosby/&gt; He selected a site on the north side of Washington Street between [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] and Dearborn Avenue, then embarked with architect [[William W. Boyington]] on a tour of opera houses in [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cities. Boyington then designed Crosby's Opera House with assistant architect John W. Roberts. Frescoes were painted by Otto Jevne and Peter M. Almini, who were partners in a Chicago decorating firm specializing in ornamental painting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philaprintshop.com/jevne.html Jevne and Almini, ''Chicago Illustrated''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813162915/http://www.philaprintshop.com/jevne.html |date=2013-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while William Voegtlin was tasked with other scenic art. Wellbaum &amp; Bauman handled carpentry and masonry with cut stone work by L. H. Boldenweck. The structure cost $600,000 ({{Inflation|US|600000|1865|fmt=eq|r=-4}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} which ruined Crosby financially.&lt;ref name=Andreas/&gt;

===Early performances===
Crosby's Opera House was scheduled to open April 17, 1865. The conductor Jules Grau would lead the inaugural series of Italian operas, performed by a company from [[New York City]]'s [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]] featuring [[Clara Louise Kellogg]]. However, the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] forced a three-day delay in the house's opening. ''[[Il trovatore]]'' was the first performance, followed by a four-week season with ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'', ''[[Poliuto|Il Poliuto]]'', ''[[Martha (opera)|Martha]]'', ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', ''[[Linda di Chamounix]]'', ''[[La sonnambula]]'', ''[[I puritani]]'', ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'', ''[[Dom Sébastien]]'', ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'', ''[[Ernani]]'', and ''[[Fra Diavolo (opera)|Fra Diavolo]]''.&lt;ref name=Andreas/&gt;

The opera house did not employ a permanent company, so there was not a continuous string of performances. In late May 1865, three comedies and a performance of ''[[Hamlet]]'' were staged as a benefit for the [[United States Sanitary Commission|Chicago Sanitary Fair]]. [[Karl Formes]] gave concerts that September, followed by performance by the [[Hanlon-Lees|Hanlon Brothers]] comedy group. The Music Hall annex, intended mostly for lectures and concerts, was completed on November 29. [[Edwin Forrest]] made his first appearance in Chicago since 1848 on January 22, 1866 with a company led by [[John Edward McCullough]]. [[James Edward Murdoch]] gave a reading for charity on February 5, 1866.&lt;ref name=Andreas/&gt;

===The Crosby Opera House lottery===
[[File:Constant Mayer - Recognition- North and South - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|''Recognition'', by [[Constant Mayer]], was the sixth prize of the lottery.]]
By May 1866, investors were weary of the leadership of Crosby, who failed to make significant profit on the property. As the Crosby Art Association, they organized a scheme to raise funds and dispose of property through a lottery. For $5 a ticket, people would receive an engraving and had the chance to acquire the opera house or any of its holdings. Works from the art gallery wing were of particular interest. The lottery was very successful, and the association had to open branch offices in other cities to comply with the demand for tickets. In the meantime, the money raised helped the opera house to hold performances from [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]] and [[Pasquale Brignoli]], which were free to anyone holding a ticket.&lt;ref name=Andreas&gt;{{cite book|last=Andreas|first=Alfred Theodore|title=History of Chicago: From the Earliest Period to the Present Time|volume=II|year=1885|publisher=The A. T. Andreas Company|place=Chicago, IL|pp=601–607}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prizes, and their values advertised, were:&lt;ref name=leslie&gt;{{cite news|title=The Opera House and Three Hundred Splendid Oil Paintings|date=August 1, 1866|publisher=''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]''|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*First: Crosby's Opera House, valued at $600,000 plus $30,000 expected earnings per year of use
*Second: [[Albert Bierstadt]]'s ''The Yo Semite Valley'', valued at $20,000.
*Third: [[Jasper Francis Cropsey]]'s ''An American Autumn'', valued at $9,000
*Fourth: [[Christian Schussele]]'s ''Washington Irving and His Friends'', valued at $5,000
*Fifth: [[James McDougal Hart]]'s ''Woods in Autumn'', valued at $5,000
*Sixth: [[Constant Mayer]]'s ''Recognition'', valued at $5,000
*Seventh: [[William Holbrook Beard]]'s ''Deer on the Prairie'', valued at $4,000
*Eighth: [[Régis François Gignoux]]'s ''Alpine Scenery'', valued at $3,000

The drawing was originally scheduled for October 11, 1866, but because of high ticket demand it was delayed until January 21, 1867. The association distributed 210,000 tickets and offered three hundred and two prizes, with the opera house as the grand prize.&lt;ref name=Andreas/&gt; 25,593 tickets were presented&lt;!--for a charge, or free?--&gt; to Crosby to give him a chance of maintaining ownership; the rest were sold.&lt;ref name=Andreas/&gt; Most shops and businesses in Chicago closed so that employees could attend the event. Nineteen trusted public officials from around the country such as banker [[William F. Coolbaugh]], former [[Lieutenant Governor of Illinois]] [[Francis Hoffmann]], [[American Express]] agent [[J. C. Fargo]], and historian [[David Pulsifer]] oversaw the drawing. ''Woods in Autumn'' was won by J. J. Taylor of [[Springfield, Illinois]] and ''Alpine Scenery'' was awarded to E. P. Dwyer of Chicago. Crosby maintained possession of ''The Yo Semite Valley'', ''An American Autumn'', and a sculpture of [[Abraham Lincoln]] by [[Leonard Volk]], valued at $2,500. ''Deer on the Prairie'' was awarded to Daniel Russell of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. A. H. Lee of [[Prairie du Rocher, Illinois]] had the winning ticket for the opera house. However, Lee's wife was ill and he had little interest in leaving her for Chicago. On January 25, 1867, he met with Crosby in Chicago and agreed to sell the house to him for $200,000.&lt;ref name=Andreas/&gt;

===Later engagements===
[[Adelaide Ristori]] made her first Chicago appearance the day after the lottery, January 22, 1867, as the lead role in ''[[Médée (Cherubini)|Médée]]''. [[James William Wallack]] and [[Edward Loomis Davenport]] gave a rendition of ''[[Othello]]'' on September 16. [[Edward Payson Weston]] held two receptions on November 28 after completing his walk from [[Portland, Maine]]. [[Patrick Gilmore]]'s band, featuring [[Camilla Urso]], began a series of concerts starting January 20, 1868. [[Fanny Janauschek]] performed for two weeks starting February 18. Works included Médée, ''[[Adriana Lecouvreur]]'', ''[[Marie Stuart (opera)|Marie Stuart]]'', ''[[Deborah (Handel)|Deborah]]'', ''[[Intrigue and Love|Love and Intrigue]]'', and ''[[Emilia Galotti]]''. Edwin Forrest made a final appearance in Chicago on March 23. The opera house was host to the [[1868 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref name=Andreas/&gt;
[[File:Lydia_Thompson..jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Lydia Thompson]] was arrested after attacking [[Wilbur F. Storey]] following his scathing review in the ''[[Chicago Times]]'' of one of her performances.]]
In November 1869, [[Lydia Thompson]] brought her troupe of dancers for a [[burlesque]]. She returned the next year on February 14. Thompson performed again on the 24th with [[Pauline Markham]]; after a particularly foul review by [[Wilbur F. Storey]] in the ''[[Chicago Times]]'', Thompson and Markham assaulted Storey in the street. Four were arrested and the trial made headlines. In April 1870, the [[Germania Männerchor]] gave three performances of ''[[The Magic Flute]]''. In May, they exhibited ''[[Stradella (opera)|Stradella]]''. In November, [[Marie Seebach]] presented ''Marie Stuart'' and ''Faust''.&lt;ref name=Andreas /&gt;

[[Christina Nilsson]] sang three concerts in December 1870. Starting on December 28 and continuing for over a month, notorious businessman [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] leased the house for his production, ''The Twelve Temptations''. Following the outrage over Rev. Lorenzo Sabine's refusal to accept the remains of actor [[George Holland]], a charity event was held on February 16, 1871 at Crosby's, raising almost $2,000 in support of Rev. [[George Hendric Houghton]] at the [[Church of the Transfiguration, Episcopal (Manhattan)|Little Church Around the Corner]]. [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]] gave the last major performance, a two-week engagement with his English Comedy Company.&lt;ref name=Andreas/&gt;

===Destruction===
In the summer of 1871, the opera house underwent alterations. Led by Albert Crosby, $80,000 was raised to lavishly redecorate the venue. An advertisement stated that the Crosby Opera House was to re-open on October 9, 1871, with a performance by [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]]. However, the night before the re-opening, a fire tore through the city. By the evening of the next day, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] had destroyed over {{convert|3.3|sqmi}} of the city, including Crosby's Opera House. It was never rebuilt,&lt;ref name=Andreas/&gt; and there was no permanent venue for opera in the city until the [[Chicago Opera House]] opened in 1885.

'''Cyber PowWow''' is an Aboriginally determined online gallery with digital artworks and a library of texts. It was conceived in 1996 and was live online from 1997 to 2004 in four main iterations. Cyber PowWow was part webspace and part chatroom, and all artwork displayed on the website was created specifically for Cyber PowWow. The website was hosted in Time Warner's "[[The Palace (computer program)|The Palace]]," a popular and influential chat room of the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Gaertner 55–78"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaertner|first=David|date=2016-04-15|title=Indigenous in Cyberspace: CyberPowWow,God's Lake Narrows, and the Contours of Online Indigenous Territory|url=http://uclajournals.org/doi/10.17953/aicrj.39.4.gaertner|journal=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|language=EN|volume=39|issue=4|pages=55–78|doi=10.17953/aicrj.39.4.gaertner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First Cyper PowWow exhibition ==
For the first Cyber PowWow event Six aboriginal artists and writers were invited to create work for the first Cyber PowWow event. The exhibition was launched with a simultaneous, distributed chat event. Participating artists, writers, and the wider public were invited to log on to the Palace to engage artists and visitors in discussions about the artwork. Skawennati Tricia Fragnito, one of the developers of Cyber PowWow, and Jason Lewis state that, "the event was successful in terms of the Aboriginal art and issues it brought into a public venue," but that, "critical dialogue was often interrupted by 'non-participants' drifting in from other chat rooms."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fragnito|first=Skawennati Tricia|date=|year=|title=Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/canada/aboriginal-territories-cyberspace|journal=|language=EN|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyber PowWow 2 ==
Cyber PowWow 2 signaled the launch of a separate Palace unique to Cyber PowWow. Eight Aboriginal artists and writers customized the chat space with imagery, scripts, and a variety of Indian avatars. Artists presented their work and answered questions about it from an enthusiastic audience composed largely of people from the Canadian contemporary art community. The participants included Ahasiw Maskegon-Iskwew, Sheryl Kootenhayoo, who contributed a Quicktime virtual reality piece, and [[Lori Blondeau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery: CyberPowWow2|url=http://www.cyberpowwow.net/gallery.html|website=CyberPowWow|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who created and led a virtual round dance.&lt;ref name="Gaertner 55–78"/&gt;

== CPW 2K: Cyber PowWow Goes Global ==
The third incarnation of Cyber PowWow included not only Canadian and American artists, but, for the first time, Australian artists as well as non-Native artists. The Aboriginal participants were joined by Mare Burgess, a white feminist researcher who studies Indian warrior women, and Sheila Urbanoski, a white artists who grew up in a town bordering a reserve. Skawennati Tricia Fragnito remarked in her curatorial essay: "Now that we have marked our territory, built a Palace and furnished it, it is time to invite in our neighbours: digital artists in the non-Native world. These friends, collaborators, and kindred spirits can talk about the very topic that we are engendering: Aboriginal meets non-Aboriginal."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Danza de los Viejitos''''' (dance of the old men) is a traditional [[folk dance]] in [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]].

== History ==
'''''Danza de los Viejitos''''' is said have begun as a dance in the [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]] Region. The men that perform this dance are known as "Danzantes" or "Dancers." This dance was danced by the Purepecha people four men to represent fire, water, earth, and air. Four dancers are also believed to be the correct number to dance in this traditional performance because there are four colors that make corn which is red, yellow, white, and blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Los viejitos, tradición purépecha|url = http://comoeneltianguis.com.mx/2014/06/01/los-viejitos/|website = Como en el tianguis|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dancers ask him for good harvest, communic.adileneation with spirits, and to learn about the past or to predict the future.

== Clothing ==
A Danzante wears a top and bottom made out of a white blanket. It is topped with a "[[Sarape]]," which is a blanket worn as a cloak in Latin America. Their Serape contains different designs and colors. They wear a hat made out of straw with adorned lengthy pieces of lace, each one a different color. The lace is parted down the middle of the hat, each one hanging 10&amp;nbsp;cm on the sides. Their shoes are sandals that have a wooden sole in order to make a tapping noise throughout their dance, followed by a wooden cane they also use. The dancers also wear a mask made out of either wood, cornstalk paste, or clay with an elderly mans face painted on it.

==Life and career==
Denis Dutton was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States, on 9 February 1944, as the second of four children of William and Thelma Dutton,&lt;ref name=woo&gt;{{Cite news| last = Woo| first = Elaine| title = Denis Dutton dies at 66: Founder of Arts &amp; Letters Daily website| work = Los Angeles Times| accessdate = 2012-02-27| date = 2 January 2011| url = http://articles.latimes.com/print/2011/jan/02/local/la-me-denis-dutton-20110102}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were booksellers and founded what became [[Dutton's Books]], a chain of independent bookstores.&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; He grew up in North Hollywood, graduated from [[North Hollywood High School]],&lt;ref name=woo /&gt; and was educated at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where he earned his bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1966 and his PhD in philosophy in 1975.&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; Between taking these degrees, he went to India with the [[Peace Corps]] and learned to play [[sitar]].&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; Dutton taught at several American universities, including the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and the [[University of Michigan–Dearborn]], before emigrating to New Zealand.

Dutton started teaching at the [[University of Canterbury]], [[Christchurch]], in 1984.&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; From 2008 to 2010, he was the Head of the Philosophy school in an unofficial capacity and acted briefly as Head of Humanities. At its December 2010 graduation ceremony, the University of Canterbury awarded Dutton a research medal for his work.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4463532"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/4463532/Renowned-academic-receives-top-honour |title=Renowned academic receives top honour |author=Matthews, Philip |date=16 December 2010 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2010, Dutton died from [[prostate cancer|cancer]].&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4498558"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/4498558/Professor-web-entrepreneur-Denis-Dutton-dies |title=Professor, web entrepreneur Denis Dutton dies |date=28 December 2010 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12088898 | work=BBC News | title=Arts author Denis Dutton dies aged 66 | date=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts &amp; Letters Daily==
{{main|Arts &amp; Letters Daily}}
Dutton was best known for the web aggregation site [[Arts &amp; Letters Daily]], which he founded in 1998 and which secured him a place among "the most influential media personalities in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Grossman| first = Lev| title = Meet Joe Blog| work = Time| date = 13 June 2004| url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,650732,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, described as "the first and foremost aggregator of well-written and well-argued book reviews, essays, and other articles in the realm of ideas",&lt;ref name=eskin&gt;{{cite news|date=28 December 2010|title=Denis Dutton|first=Blake|last=Eskin|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/postscript/2.html#entry-2000000001114450|work=The New Yorker}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; features links to articles across the web about literature, art, science, and politics, for which Dutton wrote pithy teasers.&lt;ref name=margalit-fox /&gt; In recognition of ''Arts &amp; Letters Daily'', [[Steven Pinker]] called Dutton a visionary for recognizing that a website "could be a forum for cutting-edge ideas, not just a way to sell things or entertain the bored".&lt;ref name=woo /&gt;

==Cybereditions==
Dutton served as executive director of Cybereditions, a [[print on demand]] publishing company he founded in 2000&lt;ref name=boynton&gt;{{Cite news| last = Boynton| first = Robert S.| title = Hoping Web Success Strikes Twice| work = New York Times| location = New York| date = 11 November 2000| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/11/arts/hoping-web-success-strikes-twice.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which specializes in new and out-of-print copyright works, mostly of a scholarly nature. The editorial board of the company has included other academics such as [[Frederick Crews]], [[Anthony Grafton]] and [[Marjorie Perloff]].&lt;ref name=riemer&gt;{{cite news | title=Reading between the dots|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=3 March 2001 |first=Andrew |last=Riemer|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
Dutton wrote on [[authenticity in art]] and distinguished between ''nominal authenticity'', in which a work of art is correctly attributed to its author rather than being a forgery, and ''expressive authenticity'', where a work is a true expression of an individual's or a society's values and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Authenticity in Art |url=http://www.denisdutton.com/authenticity.htm |journal=The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics |editor=Jerrold Levinson |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |author=Denis Dutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Art Instinct'' (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 1-60819-055-2| last = Dutton| first = Denis| title = The Art Instinct: Beauty, Pleasure, and Human Evolution| location = Oxford| year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton opposes the view that art appreciation is culturally learned, claiming instead that art appreciation stems from evolutionary adaptions made during the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/books/review/Gottlieb-t.html?ref=books | work=The New York Times | title=The Descent of Taste | first=Anthony | last=Gottlieb | date=1 February 2009 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set out abbreviated versions of his theory in a 2009 [[Google Videos|Google Talk]] lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Denis Dutton | year=2009 | title =Authors@Google: Denis Dutton |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-Di86RqDL4| publisher = YouTube.com | location = Mountain View, CA | accessdate = 27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2010 [[TED (conference)|TED talk]].&lt;ref name=ted&gt;{{Cite video | publisher = Video on TED.com | people = Dutton, Denis (Contributor) | title = Denis Dutton: A Darwinian theory of beauty | series = TED | accessdate = 2012-03-12 | date = February 2010 | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton also argued that progress in the arts and sciences had declined, especially since around 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denisdutton.com/murray_review.htm |title=Of Human Accomplishment| first=Denis|last=Dutton|work=Denisdutton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of academic prose==
As editor of the journal ''[[Philosophy and Literature]]'', Dutton ran the Bad Writing Contest, which aimed to "expose 'pretentious, swaggering gibberish' passed off as scholarship at leading universities".&lt;ref name=woo /&gt; In 1995, the contest was won by [[Homi K. Bhabha]] and [[Fredric Jameson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Dutton | first = Denis | title = The Bad Writing Contest: Press Releases, 1996–1998 | work = DenisDutton.com | accessdate = 2010-10-30 | year = 1998 | url = http://denisdutton.com/bad_writing.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the contest awarded first place to philosopher and [[University of California-Berkeley]] Professor [[Judith Butler]], for a sentence which appeared in the journal ''[[Diacritics (journal)|diacritics]].''&lt;ref name="language-crimes"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Dutton | first = Denis | title = Language Crimes: A Lesson in How Not to Write, Courtesy of the Professoriate | work = The Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2010-10-30 | date = 5 February 1999 | url = http://www.denisdutton.com/language_crimes.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler defended her work against the charges of academic [[pedantry]] and [[obscurantism]] in the pages of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Butler | first = Judith | title = A 'Bad Writer' Bites Back | work = New York Times | accessdate = 2010-10-30 | date = 20 March 1999 | url = https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/wash/www/butler.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111008194554/https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/wash/www/butler.htm | archivedate = 8 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton then ended the contest.

The Bad Writing Contest emerged in an intellectual climate dominated by fallout from the [[Sokal affair]],&lt;ref name=leo&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Times|date=13 March 1999| title=Pomobabble rooted in ivy|first=John|last=Leo|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

==Politics and activism==
Dutton supported "conservative ideas"&lt;ref name=colebatch&gt;{{cite news|title=Vale Denis Dutton: A professor of philosophy who civilized the Internet|first=Hal G.P.|last=Colebatch|date=30 December 2010|work=American Spectator|url=http://spectator.org/archives/2010/12/30/vale-denis-dutton|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118092733/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/12/30/vale-denis-dutton|archivedate=18 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] for some years.&lt;ref name=woo /&gt;

Dutton was one of the founding members and first chair of the [[NZ Skeptics]]. His skepticism led him to believe that "[[climate change]] is still an open question".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/lifestyle/248382/And-in-this-corner|title=And in this corner...|work=The Press|date=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a passionate supporter of [[public radio]]. In the early 1990s he founded the lobby group ''The New Zealand Friends of Public Broadcasting'' in response to proposals to devolve New Zealand's two non-commercial public radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzine.co.nz/features/broadcasting.html|title=NZine: Public broadcasting- Not everyone is apathetic|date=18 July 1998|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 he was appointed to the board of directors of [[Radio New Zealand]], where he served for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/node/12965|title=Board appointments for NZOA and RNZ|date=4 February 2002|author=Marion Hobbs, MP|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After concluding his term as a director, Dr Dutton and Dr John Isles issued a report criticising Radio New Zealand for loss of neutrality in news and current affairs, failure to adhere to charter and opposed to contestable funding of broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/mi-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/6/5/4/47HansD_20040331_00001531-Radio-New-Zealand-Amendment-Bill-In-Committee.htm |author=Coddington, Deborah M.P. |title=Parliamentary debate: 3rd reading of Radio New Zealand Amendment Bill |date=30 March 2004 |accessdate=2008-03-27 |work=Hansard }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Descent Into Hell''''' is a novel written by [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], first published in 1937.

==Overview==
Williams is less well known than his fellow [[Inklings]], such as [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Like some of them, however, he wrote a series of novels which combine elements of [[fantasy fiction]] and Christian symbolism.  Forgoing the [[detective fiction]] style of most of his earlier [[supernatural fiction|supernatural novels]], most of the story's action is spiritual or psychological in nature. It fits the "theological thriller" description sometimes given to his works. For this reason ''Descent'' was initially rejected by publishers, though [[T. S. Eliot]]'s publishing house [[Faber and Faber]] would eventually pick up the novel, as Eliot admired Williams's work, and, though he did not like ''Descent Into Hell'' as well as the earlier novels, desired to see it  printed.

==Allusions==
There are several prominent literary allusions running throughout ''Descent Into Hell''.
Battle Hill's resident poet, Peter Stanhope, frequently quotes and references [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.

[[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s work ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' is also referenced repeatedly, regarding the appearance of a [[doppelgänger]].

Less obvious Biblical allusions are present, as well as several references to mythology and legend, including [[Lilith]], [[Samael]], and [[succubus|succubi]].

==Summary==
The action takes place in Battle Hill, outside London,{{sfn|Hadfield|1987|p=141|ps=: C.W. may have had the town of [[St Albans]] in mind}} amidst the townspeople's staging of a new play by Peter Stanhope.  The hill seems to reside at the crux of time, as characters from the past appear, and perhaps at a doorway to the beyond, as characters are alternately summoned heavenwards or descend into hell.

Pauline Anstruther, the heroine of the novel, lives in fear of meeting her own [[doppelgänger]], which has appeared to her throughout her life.  But Stanhope, in an action central to the author's own theology, takes the burden of her fears upon himself—Williams called this The Doctrine of Substituted Love—and enables Pauline, at long last, to face her true self.  Williams drew this idea from the biblical verse, "Ye shall bear one another's burdens"&lt;ref&gt;[[Galatians 6#Verse 2|Galatians 6:2]], [[King James Version|Authorised Version]]&lt;/ref&gt;

And so Stanhope does take the weight, with no surreptitious motive, in the most affecting scene in the novel.  And Pauline, liberated, is able to accept truth.

On the other hand, Lawrence Wentworth, a local historian, finding his desire for Adela Hunt to be unrequited, falls in love instead with a spirit form of Adela, which seems to represent a kind of extreme self-love on his part. As he isolates himself more and more with this insubstantial figure, and dreams of descending a silver rope into a dark pit, Wentworth begins the descent into Hell.

A '''design sprint''' is a time-constrained, five-phase process that uses [[design thinking]] with the aim of reducing the risk when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market. It has been developed through independent work by many designers, including those within [[GV (company)|GV]] (formerly, Google Ventures), and those at Boston-Based User Experience Agency Fresh Tilled Soil. Two books have been published on the approach so far - one by Jake Knapp with co-authors John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprintbook.com/|title=About|website=The Sprint Book by Jake Knapp with John Zeratsky and Braden Kowitz|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another by C. Todd Lombardo, Richard Banfield, and Trace Wax&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922640422|title=Design sprint : a practical guidebook for building great digital products|last=Richard,|first=Banfield,|others=Lombardo, C. Todd,, Wax, Trace,|isbn=9781491923146|edition= First|location=Sebastopol, CA|oclc=922640422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[GV (company)|GV]], the Design Sprint concept developed from a vision to grow UX culture and the practice of design leadership across the organization. Multiple teams within Google experimented with different methods from traditional UX practice, IDEO, the Stanford dSchool and a range of other disciplines. 
The process aims to help teams to clearly define goals, validating assumptions and deciding on a product roadmap before starting development. It seeks to address [[Business strategy|strategic issues]] using interdisciplinary, rapid [[Software prototyping|prototyping,]] and [[Usability testing|user testing]]. This design process is similar to [[Sprint (software development)|Sprint]]s in an [[Agile software development|Agile]] development cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/getting-started-with-design-sprints/|title=Off To The Races: Getting Started With Design Sprints – Smashing Magazine|website=Smashing Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible uses ==

Claimed uses of the approach include

* Launching a new product or a service.
* Extending an existing experience to a new platform.
* Existing [[Minimum viable product|MVP]] needing revised [[User experience design]] and/or [[User interface design|UI Design]].
* Adding new features and functionality to a digital product.
* Opportunities for improvement of a product (e.g. a high rate of [[Abandonment rate|cart abandonment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shopify.com/blog/8484093-why-online-retailers-are-losing-67-45-of-sales-and-what-to-do-about-it|title=Why Online Retailers Are Losing 67.45%  of Sales and What to Do About It – Shopify|website=Shopify's Ecommerce Blog - Ecommerce News, Online Store Tips &amp; More|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Opportunities for improvement of a service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/service-design-sprints-deliver-speedy-improvements/|title=Service design sprints deliver speedy solutions|website= reminetwork|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phases ==
The creators of the Design Sprint approach, recommend preparation by picking the proper team, environment, materials and tools working with six key 'ingredients'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672889/from-google-ventures-the-6-ingredients-you-need-to-run-a-design-sprint|title=From Google Ventures, The 6 Ingredients You Need To Run A Design Sprint|website=Co.Design|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Understand:''' Discover the business opportunity, the audience, the competition, the value proposition, and define [[Key Performance Indicator|metrics of success]].
# '''Diverge:''' Explore, develop and iterate creative ways of solving the problem, regardless of feasibility.
# '''Converge:''' Identify ideas that fit the next product cycle and explore them in further detail through storyboarding.
# '''Prototype:''' Design and prepare prototype(s) that can be tested with people.
# '''Test:''' Conduct 1:1 [[Usability testing|user testing]] with (5-6) people from the product's primary [[target audience]]. Ask good questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dockyard.com/blog/2015/03/11/ask-good-questions|title=Ask good questions|last=Matveeva|first=Maria|date=March 10, 2015|website=Dockyard|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deliverables ==
The main deliverables after the Design sprint:
* Answers to a set of vital questions
* Findings from the sprint (notes, user journey maps, storyboards, information architecture diagrams, etc.)
* Prototypes
* Report from the user testing with the findings (backed by testing videos)
* A plan for next steps
* Validate or invalidate hypotheses before committing resources to build the solution

== Team ==
The suggested ideal number of people involved in the sprint is 4-7 people&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GV|title=Kevin Rose talks 'Sprint' with GV's Jake Knapp and Daniel Burka|date=2016-03-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1HBqlxQjZI|accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they include [[Facilitator|the facilitator]], [[designer]], a decision maker (often a [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] if the company is a [[Startup company|startup]]), [[product manager]], [[engineer]] and someone from companies core business departments (Marketing, Content, Operations, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1395">'''Doxography''' ({{lang-el|δόξα}} - "an opinion", "a point of view" + {{lang|el|γράφειν}} - "to write", "to describe") is a term used especially for the works of [[classical antiquity|classical]] historians, describing the points of view of past [[philosopher]]s and [[scientist]]s. The term was coined by the German classical scholar [[Hermann Alexander Diels]].

== Classic Greek philosophy ==

A great many philosophical works have been lost; our limited knowledge of such lost works comes chiefly through the doxographical works of later philosophers, commentators, and biographers.  Philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] also act as doxographers, as their comments on the ideas of their predecessors indirectly tell us what their predecessors' beliefs were.  Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Defense of Socrates]]'', for example, tells us much of what we know about the natural philosophy of [[Anaxagoras]].

== Islamic doxography ==

Islamic doxography is an aggregate of theosophical works (like ''[[Kitab al-Maqalat]]'' by  [[Abu Mansur Al Maturidi]]) concerning the aberrations in Islamic sects and streams.

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Vermeer]], ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]'' (1658–1660)]]

'''Dutch Golden Age painting''' is the painting of the [[Dutch Golden Age]], a period in Dutch history roughly spanning the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;In general histories 1702 is sometimes taken as the end if the Golden Age, a date which works reasonably well for painting. Slive, who avoids the term (see p. 296), divides his book into two parts: 1600–1675 (294 pages) and 1675–1800 (32 pages).&lt;/ref&gt; during and after the later part of the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) for Dutch independence.

The new [[Dutch Republic]] was the most prosperous nation in Europe and led European trade, science, and art. The northern [[Terminology of the Low Countries|Netherlandish]] provinces that made up the new state had traditionally been less important artistic centres than cities in Flanders in the south. The upheavals and large-scale transfers of population of the war, and the sharp break with the old monarchist and Catholic cultural traditions, meant that Dutch art had to reinvent itself.  The painting of religious subjects declined sharply, but a large new market for all kinds of secular subjects grew up.

Although Dutch painting of the Golden Age is included in the general European period of [[Baroque painting]], and often shows many of its characteristics, most lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including [[Flemish Baroque painting|that of neighbouring Flanders]]. Most work, including that for which the period is best known, reflects the traditions of detailed [[realism (arts)|realism]] inherited from [[Early Netherlandish painting]].
[[File:Frans Hals 008.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Hals]]' [[tronie]], with the later title ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]''. 1628–30. Oil on wood, {{convert|58|x|52|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The tronie includes elements of portraiture, genre painting, and sometimes history painting.]]

A distinctive feature of the period is the proliferation of distinct [[genre]]s of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Confusingly, one particular [[genre]] of painting is called [[genre painting]], the painting of some kind of everyday scenes with unidentified people. But, for example, [[still-life]] is also a genre in painting.&lt;/ref&gt; with the majority of artists producing the bulk of their work within one of these. The full development of this specialization is seen from the late 1620s, and the period from then until the [[Rampjaar|French invasion of 1672]] is the core of Golden Age painting.  Artists would spend most of their careers painting only portraits, genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes and ships, or still lifes, and often a particular sub-type within these categories.  Many of these types of subject were new in Western painting, and the way the Dutch painted them in this period was decisive for their future development.

==Types of painting==
[[File:Paulus Potter - Young Bull.JPG|thumb|[[Paulus Potter]], ''[[The Bull (painting)|The Bull]]'' (1647); 3.4 metres wide. An unusually monumental animal painting that challenges the [[hierarchy of genres]].]]

A distinctive feature of the period, compared to earlier European painting, was the limited number of religious paintings. Dutch [[Calvinism]] forbade religious paintings in churches, and though biblical subjects were acceptable in private homes, relatively few were produced. The other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present, but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres, sub-divided into numerous specialized categories, such as scenes of peasant life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes with animals, maritime paintings, flower paintings and [[still life]]s of various types. The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists.

The widely held theory of the "[[hierarchy of genres]]" in painting, whereby some types were regarded as more prestigious than others, led many painters to want to produce history painting. However this was the hardest to sell, as even Rembrandt found. Many were forced to produce portraits or genre scenes, which sold much more easily. In descending order of status, the categories in the hierarchy were:
*[[history painting]], including [[Allegory|allegories]] and popular religious subjects.
*[[Portrait painting]], including the ''[[tronie]]''
*[[Genre works|genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|landscape]], including seascapes, battlescenes, cityscapes, and ruins (landscapists were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 104&lt;/ref&gt;) 
*[[still life]]

The Dutch concentrated heavily on the "lower" categories, but by no means rejected the concept of the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Most paintings were relatively small – the only common type of really large paintings were group portraits. Painting directly onto walls hardly existed; when a wall-space in a public building needed decorating, fitted framed canvas was normally used. For the extra precision possible on a hard surface, many painters continued to use wooden panels, some time after the rest of Western Europe had abandoned them; some used copper plates, usually recycling plates from [[printmaking]]. In turn, the number of surviving Golden Age paintings was reduced by them being overpainted with new works by artists throughout the 18th and 19th century – poor ones were usually cheaper than a new canvas, stretcher and frame. 

There was very little Dutch sculpture during the period; it is mostly found in [[tomb monument]]s and attached to public buildings, and small sculptures for houses are a noticeable gap, their place taken by silverware and [[ceramic art|ceramics]]. Painted [[delftware]] tiles were very cheap and common, if rarely of really high quality, but silver, especially in the [[auricular style]], led Europe. With this exception, the best artistic efforts were concentrated on painting and printmaking.

==The art world==
[[File:Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirck Hals]], genre scene of ''Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior''. Note the paintings on the wall of what appears to be a tavern; also [[commons:File:Quiringh van Brekelenkam - Tailor's Workshop.jpg|here]].]]

Foreigners remarked on the enormous quantities of art produced and the large fairs where many paintings were sold – it has been roughly estimated that over 1.3 million Dutch pictures were painted in the 20 years after 1640 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, 15, citing [[Jonathan Israel]]. Perhaps only 1% survive today, and "only about 10% of these were of real quality".&lt;/ref&gt;  The volume of production meant that prices were fairly low, except for the best known artists; as in most subsequent periods, there was a steep price gradient for more fashionable artists.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Those without a strong contemporary reputation, or who had fallen out of fashion, including many now considered among the greatest of the period, such as [[Vermeer]], [[Frans Hals]] and [[Rembrandt]] in his last years, had considerable problems earning a living, and died poor; many artists had other jobs, or abandoned art entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Steen]] was an innkeeper, [[Aelbert Cuyp]] was one of many whose wealthy wives persuaded them to give up painting, although [[Karel Dujardin]] seems to have run away from his to continue his work. Conversely [[Jan van de Cappelle]] came from a very wealthy family, and [[Joachim Wtewael]] was a self-made [[flax]] tycoon. See their biographies in MacLaren. The fish artist [[Jacob Gillig]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qkW3ff-NRZoC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%22Jacob+Gillig%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jacob%20Gillig%22&amp;f=false also worked as a warder in the Utrecht prison, conveniently close to the fish market.] Bankrupts included: Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jan de Bray, and many others.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the French invasion of 1672 (the ''[[Rampjaar]]'', or "year of disaster"), brought a severe depression to the art market, which never quite returned to earlier heights.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 217 and ff. on 1672 and its effects.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of pictures was very wide: "yea many tymes, blacksmithes, cobblers etts., will have some picture or other by their Forge and in their stalle. Such is the generall Notion, enclination and delight that these Countrie Native have to Painting" reported an English traveller in 1640.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 43; Franits, 2 calls this "oft-quoted" remark "undoubtedly exaggerated".&lt;/ref&gt;  There were for virtually the first time many professional art dealers, several also significant artists, like [[Vermeer]] and his father, [[Jan van Goyen]] and [[Willem Kalf]]. Rembrandt's dealer [[Hendrick van Uylenburgh]] and his son [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh|Gerrit]] were among the most important.  Landscapes were the easiest uncommissioned works to sell, and their painters were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|The Haarlem Painter's Guild]]'' in 1675, by  [[Jan de Bray]], whose self-portrait is the second from the left]]

The technical quality of Dutch artists was generally high, still mostly following the old medieval system of training by apprenticeship with a master.  Typically workshops were smaller than in Flanders or Italy, with only one or two apprentices at a time, the number often being restricted by guild regulations.  The turmoil of the early years of the Republic, with displaced artists from the South moving north and the loss of traditional markets in the court and church, led to a resurgence of artists guilds, often still called the [[Guild of Saint Luke]].  In many cases these involved the artists extricating themselves from medieval groupings where they shared a guild with several other trades, such as housepainting.  Several new guilds were established in the period: [[Amsterdam]] in 1579, [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|Haarlem]] in 1590, and [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Delft]] between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2008), 151-153, or Prak (2003), 241&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leiden]] authorities distrusted guilds and did not allow one until 1648.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2008), 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century it began to become clear to all involved that the old idea of a guild controlling both training and sales no long worked well, and gradually the guilds were replaced with [[academies]], often only concerned with the training of artists.  [[The Hague]], with the court, was an early example, where artists split into two groups in 1656 with the founding of the [[Confrerie Pictura]].  With the obvious exception of portraits, many more Dutch paintings were done "speculatively" without a specific commission than was then the case in other countries – one of many ways in which the Dutch art market showed the future.&lt;ref name="Fuchs, 43"&gt;Fuchs, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many dynasties of artists, and many married the daughters of their masters or other artists. Many artists came from well-off families, who paid fees for their apprenticeships, and they often married into property. Rembrandt and Jan Steen were both enrolled at the [[University of Leiden]] for a while. Several cities had distinct styles and specialities by subject, but Amsterdam was the largest artistic centre, because of its great wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Franits' book is largely organized by city and by period; Slive by subject categories&lt;/ref&gt;  Cities such as [[Haarlem]] and [[Utrecht]] were more important in the first half of the century, with [[Leiden]] and other cities emerging after 1648, and above all Amsterdam, which increasingly drew to it artists from the rest of the Netherlands, as well as [[Flanders]] and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Franits throughout, summarized on p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch artists were strikingly less concerned about artistic theory than those of many nations, and less given to discussing their art; it appears that there was also much less interest in artistic theory in general intellectual circles and among the wider public than was by then common in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 76&lt;/ref&gt;  As nearly all commissions and sales were private, and between bourgeois individuals whose accounts have not been preserved, these are also less well documented than elsewhere. But Dutch art was a source of national pride, and the major biographers are crucial sources of information. These are [[Karel van Mander]] (Het Schilderboeck, 1604), who essentially covers the previous century, and [[Arnold Houbraken]] (''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' – "The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters", 1718–21). Both followed, and indeed exceeded, [[Vasari]] in including a great number of short lives of artists – over 500 in Houbraken's case – and both are considered generally accurate on factual matters.

The German artist [[Joachim von Sandrart]] (1606–1688) had worked for periods in Holland, and his ''Deutsche Akademie'' in the same format covers many Dutch artists he knew. Houbraken's master, and Rembrandt's pupil, was [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]] (1627–1678), whose ''Zichtbare wereld'' and ''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' (1678) contain more critical than biographical information, and are among the most important treatises on painting of the period. Like other Dutch works on the theory of art, they expound many commonplaces of Renaissance theory and do not entirely reflect contemporary Dutch art, still often concentrating on history painting.&lt;ref&gt;See Slive, 296-7 and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

==History painting==
[[File:Danae by Van Loo.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob van Loo]], ''[[Danaë]]'' (compare [[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Rembrandt's treatment]])]]

This category comprises not only paintings that depicted historical events of the past, but also paintings that showed biblical, mythological, literary and [[allegory|allegorical]] scenes. Recent historical events essentially fell out of the category, and were treated in a realist fashion, as the appropriate combination of portraits with marine, townscape or landscape subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 107&lt;/ref&gt;  Large dramatic historical or Biblical scenes were produced less frequently than in other countries, as there was no local market for church art, and few large aristocratic Baroque houses to fill. More than that, the Protestant population of major cities had been exposed to some remarkably hypocritical uses of [[Mannerist]] allegory in unsuccessful Habsburg propaganda during the [[Dutch Revolt]], which had produced a strong reaction towards realism and a distrust of grandiose visual rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 62, R.H. Wilenski, ''Dutch Painting'', "Prologue" pp.&amp;nbsp;27–43, 1945, Faber, London&lt;/ref&gt;  History painting was now a "minority art", although to an extent this was redressed by a relatively keen interest in print versions of history subjects&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 62-3&lt;/ref&gt;

More than in other types of painting, Dutch history painters continued to be influenced by Italian painting. Prints and copies of Italian masterpieces circulated and suggested certain compositional schemes. The growing Dutch skill in the depiction of light was brought to bear on styles derived from Italy, notably that of [[Caravaggio]]. Some Dutch painters also travelled to Italy, though this was less common than with their Flemish contemporaries, as can be seen from the membership of the [[Bentvueghels]] club in Rome.&lt;ref name="Fuchs, 43"/&gt;

[[File:Dirk van Baburen - Kroning met de doornenkroon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Utrecht Caravaggism]]: [[Dirck van Baburen]], ''Christ crowned with thorns'', 1623, for a convent in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], not a market available in most of Holland.]]

In the early part of the century many [[Northern Mannerist]] artists with styles formed in the previous century continued to work, until the 1630s in the cases of [[Abraham Bloemaert]] and [[Joachim Wtewael]].&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  Many history paintings were small in scale, with the German painter (based in Rome) [[Adam Elsheimer]] as much an influence as Caravaggio (both died in 1610) on Dutch painters like [[Pieter Lastman]], Rembrandt's master, and Jan and [[Jacob Pynas]]. Compared to Baroque history painting from other countries, they shared the Dutch emphasis on realism, and narrative directness, and are sometimes known as the "Pre-Rembrandtists", as Rembrandt's early paintings were in this style.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 62-69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utrecht Caravaggism]] describes a group of artists who produced both history painting and generally large genre scenes in an Italian-influenced style, often making heavy use of [[chiaroscuro]]. Utrecht, before the revolt the most important city in the new Dutch territory, was an unusual Dutch city, still about 40% Catholic in the mid-century, even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 65. Catholic 17th-century Dutch artists included Abraham Bloemaert and Gerard van Honthorst from Utrecht, and Jan Steen, [[Paulus Bor]], [[Jacob van Velsen]], plus Vermeer who probably converted at his marriage.[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/catholic_church.html]  [[Jacob Jordaens]] was among Flemish Protestant artists.&lt;/ref&gt;  The leading artists were [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerard van Honthorst]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]], and the school was active about 1630, although van Honthorst continued until the 1650s as a successful court painter to the English, Dutch and Danish courts in a more classical style.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 22-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Rembrandt began as a history painter before finding financial success as a portraitist, and he never relinquished his ambitions in this area. A great number of his [[etching]]s are of narrative religious scenes, and the story of his last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  Several artists, many his pupils, attempted with some success to continue his very personal style; [[Govaert Flinck]] was the most successful.  [[Gerard de Lairesse]] (1640–1711) was another of these, before falling under heavy influence from French classicism, and becoming its leading Dutch proponent as both artist and theoretician.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudity was effectively the preserve of the history painter, although many portraitists dressed up their occasional nudes (nearly always female) with a classical title, as Rembrandt did. For all their uninhibited suggestiveness, genre painters rarely revealed more than a generous cleavage or stretch of thigh, usually when painting prostitutes or "Italian" peasants.

==Portraits==
[[File:Portrait sophia trip wife of balthasar coymans.jpg|thumb|[[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], ''Sophia Trip'' (1645), a member of one of the wealthiest families in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beernink.com/articles/triptree.htm?timeline=off Trip family tree]. Her grandparents' various portraits by Rembrandt are famous.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century, as there was a large mercantile class who were far more ready to commission portraits than their equivalents in other countries; a summary of various estimates of total production arrives at between 750,000 and 1,100,000 portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart, 17 n.1 (on p. 228).&lt;/ref&gt;  Rembrandt enjoyed his greatest period of financial success as a young Amsterdam portraitist, but like other artists, grew rather bored with painting commissioned portraits of burghers: "artists travel along this road without delight", according to van Mander.&lt;ref&gt;Shawe-Taylor, 22-23, 32-33 on portraits, quotation from 33&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dutch portrait painting avoids the swagger and excessive rhetoric of the aristocratic Baroque portraiture current in the rest of 17th-century Europe, the sombre clothing of male and in many cases female sitters, and the Calvinist feeling that the inclusion of props, possessions or views of land in the background would show the sin of pride leads to an undeniable sameness in many Dutch portraits, for all their technical quality. Even a standing pose is usually avoided, as a full-length might also show pride. Poses are undemonstrative, especially for women, though children may be allowed more freedom. The classic moment for having a portrait painted was upon marriage, when the new husband and wife more often than not occupied separate frames in a pair of paintings. Rembrandt's later portraits compel by force of characterization, and sometimes a narrative element, but even his early portraits can be dispiriting ''en masse'', as in the roomful of 'starter Rembrandts' donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

[[File:Willem Heythuijsen by Frans Hals 1634.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frans Hals]], ''Willem Heythuijsen'' (1634), {{convert|47|x|37|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]
[[File:Van den Kerckhoven door Jan Mijtens.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johannes Mytens|Jan Mijtens]], family portrait, 1652, with the boys in "picturesque" dress.]]

The other great portraitist of the period is [[Frans Hals]], whose famously lively brushwork and ability to show sitters looking relaxed and cheerful adds excitement to even the most unpromising subjects. The extremely "nonchalant pose" of his portrait of Willem Heythuijsen is exceptional: "no other portrait from this period is so informal".&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart, 118&lt;/ref&gt;  The sitter was a wealthy textile merchant who had already commissioned Hals' only individual life-sized full-length portrait ten years before. In this much smaller work for a private chamber he wears riding clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart, 130 and 114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan de Bray]] encouraged his sitters to pose costumed as figures from classical history, but many of his works are of his own family. [[Thomas de Keyser]], [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], [[Ferdinand Bol]] and others, including many mentioned below as history or genre painters, did their best to enliven more conventional works. Portraiture, less affected by fashion than other types of painting, remained the safe fallback for Dutch artists.

From what little we know of the studio procedures of artists, it seems that, as elsewhere in Europe, the face was probably drawn and perhaps painted at an initial sitting or two. The typical number of further sittings is unclear - between zero (for a Rembrandt full-length) and 50 appear documented. The clothes were left at the studio and might well be painted by assistants, or a brought-in specialist master, although, or because, they were regarded as a very important part of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Married and never-married women can be distinguished by their dress, highlighting how few single women were painted, except in family groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 66-68&lt;/ref&gt;  As elsewhere, the accuracy of the clothes shown is variable - striped and patterned clothes were worn, but artists rarely show them, understandably avoiding the extra work.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 73&lt;/ref&gt; Lace and [[ruff]] collars were unavoidable, and presented a formidable challenge to painters intent on realism. Rembrandt evolved a more effective way of painting patterned lace, laying in broad white stokes, and then painting lightly in black to show the pattern. Another way of doing this was to paint in white over a black layer, and scratch off the white with the end of the brush to show the pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 69-71&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the century there was a fashion for showing sitters in a semi-fancy dress, begun in England by van Dyck in the 1630s, known as "picturesque" or "Roman" dress.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristocratic, and militia, sitters allowed themselves more freedom in bright dress and expansive settings than burghers, and religious affiliations probably affected many depictions. By the end of the century aristocratic, or French, values were spreading among the burghers, and depictions were allowed more freedom and display.

A distinctive type of painting, combining elements of the portrait, history, and genre painting was the [[tronie]]. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model was not supposed to be important, but they might represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. [[Jan Lievens]] and Rembrandt, many of whose self-portraits are also tronies (especially his etched ones), were among those who developed the genre.

Family portraits tended, as in Flanders, to be set outdoors in gardens, but without an extensive view as later in England, and to be relatively informal in dress and mood.  Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the officers of a city's [[schutterij]] or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter.  Rembrandt's ''[[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild (Rembrandt)|Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]]'' is a subtle treatment of a group round a table.

[[File:Frans Hals, De magere compagnie.jpg|thumb|350px|''The [[Meagre Company]]'', an Amsterdam [[militia group portrait]] or ''schutterstuk'' by [[Frans Hals]] and [[Pieter Codde]] (1633-37)]]

Scientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Physicians sometimes posed together around a cadaver, a so-called 'Anatomical Lesson', the most famous one being Rembrandt's ''[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'' (1632, [[Mauritshuis]], [[The Hague]]). Boards of trustees in their ''[[regentenstuk]]'' portraits preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces.

Most [[militia group portrait]]s were commissioned in [[Haarlem]] and [[Amsterdam]], and were much more flamboyant and relaxed or even boisterous than other types of portraits, as well as much larger.  Early examples showed them dining, but later groups showed most figures standing for a more dynamic composition.  Rembrandt's famous ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'' better known as the ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642), was an ambitious and not entirely successful attempt to show a group in action, setting out for a patrol or parade, also innovative in avoiding the typical very wide format of such works.

The cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. In Amsterdam most of these paintings would ultimately end up in the possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the [[Amsterdams Historisch Museum]]; there are no significant examples outside the Netherlands.

==Scenes of everyday life==
[[File:Jan Steen 004b.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[Jan Steen]] picture (c. 1663); while the housewife sleeps, the household play.&lt;ref&gt;Another version at [[Apsley House]], with a different composition, but using most of the same moralizing objects, is analysed by Franits, 206-9&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Genre paintings]] show scenes that prominently feature figures to whom no specific identity can be attached – they are not portraits or intended as historical figures. Together with landscape painting, the development and enormous popularity of genre painting is the most distinctive feature of Dutch painting in this period, although in this case they were also very popular in Flemish painting. Many are single figures, like the Vermeer's ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''; others may show large groups at some social occasion, or crowds. There were a large number of sub-types within the genre: single figures, peasant families, tavern scenes, "[[merry company]]" parties, women at work about the house, scenes of village or town festivities (though these were still more common in Flemish painting), market scenes, barracks scenes, scenes with horses or farm animals, in snow, by moonlight, and many more. In fact most of these had specific terms in Dutch, but there was no overall Dutch term equivalent to "genre painting" – until the late 18th century the English often called them "drolleries".&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 42 and Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Some artists worked mostly within one of these sub-types, especially after about 1625.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the century, genre paintings tended to reduce in size.

Though genre paintings provide many insights into the daily life of 17th-century citizens of all classes, their accuracy cannot always be taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 1, mentioning costume in works by the Utrecht Caravagggisti, and architectural settings, as especially prone to abandon accurate depiction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many which seemed only to depict everyday scenes actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings or conveyed a moralistic message – the meaning of which may now need to be deciphered by art historians, though some are clear enough. Many artists, and no doubt purchasers, certainly tried to have things both ways, enjoying the depiction of disorderly households or brothel scenes, while providing a moral interpretation – the works of [[Jan Steen]], whose other profession was as an innkeeper, are an example. The balance between these elements is still debated by art historians today.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 4-6 summarizes the debate, for which [[Svetlana Alpers]]' ''The Art of Describing'' (1983) is an important work (though see Slive's terse comment on p. 344). See also Franits, 20-21 on paintings being understood differently by contemporary individuals, and his p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerrit van Honthorst - De koppelaarster.jpg|thumb|[[Gerrit van Honthorst]] (1625), punning visually on the [[lute]] in this brothel scene]]

The titles given later to paintings often distinguish between "[[tavern]]s" or "[[inn]]s" and "[[brothel]]s", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: "Inn in front; brothel behind" was a Dutch [[proverb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf On Diderot's Art Criticism. Mira Friedman, p. 36] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721134904/http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Steen above is very clearly an ''exemplum'', and though each of the individual components of it is realistically depicted, the overall scene is not a plausible depiction of a real moment; typically of genre painting, it is a situation that is depicted, and satirized.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 39-42, analyses two comparable scenes by Steen and Dou, and p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] tradition of recondite [[emblem books]] had, in the hands of the 17th-century Dutch – almost universally literate in the vernacular, but mostly without education in the classics – turned into the popularist and highly moralistic works of [[Jacob Cats]], [[Roemer Visscher]], and others, often based in popular [[proverb]]s. The illustrations to these are often quoted directly in paintings, and since the start of the 20th century art historians have attached proverbs, sayings and mottoes to a great number of genre works. Another popular source of meaning is visual puns using the great number of Dutch [[slang]] terms in the sexual area: the [[vagina]] could be represented by a [[lute]] (''luit'') or [[stocking]] (''kous''), and sex by a bird (''vogelen''), among many other options,&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, pp 54, 44, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and purely visual symbols such as shoes, spouts, and jugs and flagons on their side.

[[File:Peasants in an Interior (1661) Adriaen van Ostade.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adriaen van Ostade]], ''Peasants in an Interior'' (1661)]]

The same painters often painted works in a very different spirit of housewives or other women at rest in the home or at work – they massively outnumber similar treatments of men.  In fact working class men going about their jobs are notably absent from Dutch Golden Age art, with landscapes populated by travellers and idlers but rarely tillers of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 191&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the Dutch Republic being the most important nation in international trade in Europe, and the abundance of marine paintings, scenes of dock workers and other commercial activities are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 1&lt;/ref&gt;  This group of subjects was a Dutch invention, reflecting the cultural preoccupations of the age,&lt;ref&gt;Explored at length by Schama in his Chapter 6. See also the analysis of [[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)]], claimed by different art historians for each tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; and was to be adopted by artists from other countries, especially France, in the two centuries following.

The tradition developed from the realism and detailed background activity of Early Netherlandish painting, which [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were among the first to turn into their principal subjects, also making use of proverbs. The [[Haarlem]] painters [[Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech]], [[Frans Hals]] and [[Esaias van de Velde]] were important painters early in the period. Buytewech painted "[[Merry company|merry companies]]" of finely dressed young people, with moralistic significance lurking in the detail. 
[[File:Gabriël Metsu 006.jpg|thumb|[[Gabriel Metsu]], ''The Hunter's Gift'', c. 1660, a study in marital relations, with a visual pun.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 180-182, though he strangely seems to discount the possibility that the couple are married. Married or not, the hunter clearly hopes for a return from his gift of (punning) birds, though the open shoe and gun on the floor, pointing in different directions, suggest he may be disappointed. Metsu used opposed dogs several times, and may have invented the motif, which was copied by Victorian artists. A statue of [[Cupid]] presides over the scene.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Van de Velde was also important as a landscapist, whose scenes included unglamorous figures very different from those in his genre paintings, which were typically set at garden parties in country houses. Hals was principally a portraitist, but also painted genre figures of a portrait size early in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 24-27&lt;/ref&gt;

A stay in Haarlem by the Flemish master of peasant tavern scenes [[Adriaen Brouwer]], from 1625 or 1626, gave [[Adriaen van Ostade]] his lifelong subject, though he often took a more sentimental approach. Before Brouwer, peasants had normally been depicted outdoors; he usually shows them in a plain and dim interior, though van Ostade's sometimes occupy ostentatiously decrepit farmhouses of enormous size.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 34-43. Presumably these are intended to imply houses abandoned by Catholic gentry who had fled south in the Eighty Years' War. His self-portrait shows him, equally implausibly, working in just such a setting.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ostade was as likely to paint a single figure as a group, as were the Utrecht Caravaggisti in their genre works, and the single figure, or small groups of two or three became increasingly common, especially those including women and children. The most notable woman artist of the period, [[Judith Leyster]] (1609–1660), specialized in these, before her husband, [[Jan Miense Molenaer]], prevailed on her to give up painting. The [[Leiden]] school of ''[[fijnschilder]]'' ("fine painters") were renowned for small and highly finished paintings, many of this type. Leading artists included [[Gerard Dou]], [[Gabriel Metsu]], [[Frans van Mieris the Elder]], and later his son [[Willem van Mieris]], [[Godfried Schalcken]], and [[Adriaen van der Werff]].

This later generation, whose work now seems over-refined compared to their predecessors, also painted portraits and histories, and were the most highly regarded and rewarded Dutch painters by the end of the period, whose works were sought after all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  Genre paintings reflected the increasing prosperity of Dutch society, and settings grew steadily more comfortable, opulent and carefully depicted as the century progressed. Artists not part of the Leiden group whose common subjects also were more intimate genre groups included [[Nicolaes Maes]], [[Gerard ter Borch]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]], whose interest in light in interior scenes was shared with [[Jan Vermeer]], long a very obscure figure, but now the most highly regarded genre painter of all.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Landscapes and cityscapes==
[[File:Esaias van de Velde Winter Landscape.jpg|thumb|left|[[Esaias van de Velde]], ''Winter Landscape'' (1623)]]

[[Landscape art|Landscape painting]] was a major genre in the 17th century. Flemish landscapes (particularly from [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]) of the 16th century first served as an example. These had been not particularly realistic, having been painted mostly in the studio, partly from imagination, and often still using the semi-aerial view from above typical of earlier [[Netherlandish]] landscape painting in the "[[world landscape]]" tradition of [[Joachim Patinir]], [[Herri met de Bles]] and the early [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. A more realistic Dutch landscape style developed, seen from ground level, often based on drawings made outdoors, with lower horizons which made it possible to emphasize the often impressive cloud formations that were (and are) so typical in the climate of the region, and which cast a particular light. Favourite subjects were the dunes along the western sea coast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often with the silhouette of a city in the distance. Winter landscapes with frozen canals and creeks also abounded. The sea was a favourite topic as well since the Low Countries depended on it for trade, battled with it for new land, and battled on it with competing nations.

Important early figures in the move to realism were [[Esaias van de Velde]] (1587–1630) and [[Hendrick Avercamp]] (1585–1634), both also mentioned above as genre painters – in Avercamp's case the same paintings deserve mention in each category. From the late 1620s the "tonal phase" of landscape painting started, as artists softened or blurred their outlines, and concentrated on an atmospheric effect, with great prominence given to the sky, and human figures usually either absent or small and distant. Compositions based on a diagonal across the picture space became popular, and water often featured. The leading artists were [[Jan van Goyen]] (1596–1656), [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] (1602–1670), [[Pieter de Molyn]] (1595–1661), and in marine painting [[Simon de Vlieger]] (1601–1653), with a host of minor figures – a recent study lists over 75 artists who worked in van Goyen's manner for at least a period, including Cuyp.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 189 – the study is by H.-U. Beck (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aelbert Cuyp - Rivierlandschap met ruiters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Aelbert Cuyp]], ''River landscape with Riders'' (c. 1655); Cuyp specialized in golden evening light in Dutch settings.]]

From the 1650s the "classical phase" began, retaining the atmospheric quality, but with more expressive compositions and stronger contrasts of light and colour. Compositions are often anchored by a single "heroic tree", windmill or tower, or ship in marine works.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 190 (quote), 195-202&lt;/ref&gt;  The leading artist was [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] (1628–1682), who produced a great quantity and variety of work, using every typical Dutch subject except the Italianate landscape (below); instead he produced "Nordic" landscapes of dark and dramatic mountain pine forests with rushing torrents and waterfalls.&lt;ref&gt;Derived from works by [[Allart van Everdingen]] who, unlike Ruysdael, had visited Norway, in 1644. Slive, 203&lt;/ref&gt;  

His pupil was [[Meindert Hobbema]] (1638–1709), best known for his atypical ''[[Avenue at Middelharnis]]'' (1689, London), a departure from his usual scenes of watermills and roads through woods. Two other artists with more personal styles, whose best work included larger pictures (up to a metre or more across), were [[Aelbert Cuyp]] (1620–1691) and [[Philips Koninck]] (1619–1688). Cuyp took golden Italian light and used it in evening scenes with a group of figures in the foreground and behind them a river and wide landscape. Koninck's best works are panoramic views, as from a hill, over wide flat farmlands, with a huge sky.

A different type of landscape, produced throughout the tonal and classical phases, was the romantic Italianate landscape, typically in more mountainous settings than are found in the Netherlands, with golden light, and sometimes picturesque Mediterranean [[staffage]] and ruins. Not all the artists who specialized in these had visited Italy. [[Jan Both]] (d. 1652), who had been to Rome and worked with [[Claude Lorrain]], was a leading developer of the subgenre, which influenced the work of many painters of landscapes with Dutch settings, such as Aelbert Cuyp. Other artists who consistently worked in the style were [[Nicolaes Berchem]] (1620–1683) and [[Adam Pijnacker]]. Italianate landscapes were popular as prints, and more paintings by Berchem were reproduced in engravings during the period itself than those of any other artist.&lt;ref name="Slive, 225"&gt;Slive, 225&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other artists do not fit in any of these groups, above all Rembrandt, whose relatively few painted landscapes show various influences, including some from [[Hercules Seghers]] (c. 1589–c. 1638); his very rare large mountain valley landscapes were a very personal development of 16th-century styles.&lt;ref&gt;Rembrandt owned seven Seghers; after a recent fire only 11 are now thought to survive – how many of Rembrandt's remain is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aert van der Neer]] (d. 1677) painted very small scenes of rivers at night or under ice and snow.

Landscapes with animals in the foreground were a distinct sub-type, and were painted by Cuyp, [[Paulus Potter]] (1625–1654), [[Albert Jansz. Klomp]] (1625-1688), [[Adriaen van de Velde]] (1636–1672) and [[Karel Dujardin]] (1626–1678, farm animals), with [[Philips Wouwerman]] painting horses and riders in various settings. The cow was a symbol of prosperity to the Dutch, hitherto overlooked in art, and apart from the horse by far the most commonly shown animal; goats were used to indicate Italy. Potter's ''The Young Bull'' is an enormous and famous portrait which Napoleon took to Paris (it later returned) though livestock analysts have noted from the depiction of the various parts of the anatomy that it appears to be a composite of studies of six different animals of widely different ages.

Architecture also fascinated the Dutch, churches in particular. At the start of the period the main tradition was of fanciful palaces and city views of invented Northern Mannerist architecture, which Flemish painting continued to develop, and in Holland was represented by [[Dirck van Delen]]. A greater realism began to appear and the exteriors and interiors of actual buildings were reproduced, though not always faithfully. During the century understanding of the proper rendering of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] grew and were enthusiastically applied. Several artists specialized in church interiors.

[[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]], whose father [[Jan Saenredam]] engraved sensuous nude Mannerist goddesses, painted unpeopled views of now whitewashed Gothic city churches. His emphasis on even light and geometry, with little depiction of surface textures, is brought out by comparing his works with those of [[Emanuel de Witte]], who left in the people, uneven floors, contrasts of light and such clutter of church furniture as remained in Calvinist churches, all usually ignored by Saenredam.  [[Gerard Houckgeest]], followed by van Witte and [[Hendrick van Vliet]], had supplemented the traditional view along a main axis of the church with diagonal views that added drama and interest.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 268-273&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Gerrit Berckheyde]] specialized in lightly populated views of main city streets, squares, and major public buildings; [[Jan van der Heyden]] preferred more intimate scenes of quieter Amsterdam streets, often with trees and canals. These were real views, but he did not hesitate to adjust them for compositional effect.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 273-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime painting==
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], typical ''View of Deventer Seen from the North-West'' (1657); an example of the "tonal phase".]]

The [[Dutch Republic]] relied on trade by sea for its exceptional wealth, had naval wars with Britain and other nations during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. It is therefore no surprise that the genre of [[marine art|maritime painting]] was enormously popular, and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists; as with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting was a crucial step.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;  Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a [[Dutch navy]] at the peak of its glory, though today it is usually the more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated. Ships are normally at sea, and dock scenes surprisingly absent.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

More often than not, even small ships fly the [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch tricolour]], and many vessels can be identified as naval or one of the many other government ships. Many pictures included some land, with a beach or harbour viewpoint, or a view across an estuary. Other artists specialized in river scenes, from the small pictures of [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] with little boats and reed-banks to the large Italianate landscapes of [[Aelbert Cuyp]], where the sun is usually setting over a wide river. The genre naturally shares much with landscape painting, and in developing the depiction of the sky the two went together; many landscape artists also painted beach and river scenes. Artists included [[Jan Porcellis]], [[Simon de Vlieger]], [[Jan van de Cappelle]], [[Hendrick Dubbels]] and [[Abraham Storck]].  [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|his son]] are the leading masters of the later decades, tending, as at the beginning of the century, to make the ship the subject, whereas in tonal works of earlier decades the emphasis had been on the sea and the weather. They left for London in 1672, leaving the master of heavy seas, the German-born [[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], as the leading artist.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213-224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Still lifes==
[[File:Pieter Claesz 002b.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Claesz]], ''Vanitas'' (1630)]]

[[Still lifes]] were a great opportunity to display skill in painting textures and surfaces in great detail and with realistic light effects. Food of all kinds laid out on a table, silver cutlery, intricate patterns and subtle folds in table cloths and flowers all challenged painters.

Several types of subject were recognised: ''banketje'' were "banquet pieces", ''ontbijtjes'' simpler "breakfast pieces".&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtually all still lifes had a moralistic message, usually concerning the brevity of life – this is known as the [[vanitas]] theme – implicit even in the absence of an obvious symbol like a skull, or less obvious one such as a half-peeled lemon (like life, sweet in appearance but bitter to taste).&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 279-281. Fuchs, 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Flowers wilt and food decays, and silver is of no use to the soul. Nevertheless, the force of this message seems less powerful in the more elaborate pieces of the second half of the century.

[[File:Pronkstillleven.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abraham van Beijeren]] (c. 1660); "ostentatious" still life.]]

Initially the objects shown were nearly always mundane. However, from the mid-century ''[[pronkstilleven]]s'' ("ostentatious still lifes"), which depicted expensive and exotic objects and had been developed as a subgenre in the 1640s in Antwerp by Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]], became more popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100349439?rskey=FT16aA&amp;result=0&amp;q=pronkstilleven Pronkstilleven] in: Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms&lt;/ref&gt; The early realist, tonal and classical phases of landscape painting had counterparts in still life painting.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 113-6&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Willem Claeszoon Heda]] (1595–c. 1680) and [[Willem Kalf]] (1619–1693) led the change to the ''pronkstilleven'', while [[Pieter Claesz]] (d. 1660) preferred to paint simpler "ontbijt" ("breakfast pieces"), or explicit ''vanitas'' pieces.

In all these painters, colours are often very muted, with browns dominating, especially in the middle of the century. This is less true of the works of [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]] (1606–1684), an important figure who spent much of his career based over the border in [[Antwerp]]. Here his displays began to sprawl sideways to form wide oblong pictures, unusual in the north, although Heda sometimes painted taller vertical compositions. Still life painters were especially prone to form dynasties, it seems: there were many de Heems and Bosschaerts, Heda's son continued in his father's style, and Claesz was the father of Nicholaes Berchem.

[[File:Jakob Gillig - Freshwater Fish.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Gillig]], ''Freshwater Fish'' (1684)]]
Flower paintings formed a sub-group with its own specialists, and were occasionally the speciality of the few women artists, such as [[Maria van Oosterwyck]] and [[Rachel Ruysch]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gQLqRd7hJq0C&amp;pg=PA984&amp;dq=Houbraken+Leyster&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0M61S8yHOuKJ4gbB1oWbCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Houbraken%20Leyster&amp;f=false and only a few others, see Slive, 128, 320-321 and index, and Schama, 414. The outstanding woman artist of the age was Judith Leyster.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dutch also led the world in botanical and other scientific drawings, prints and book illustrations. Despite the intense realism of individual flowers, paintings were composed from individual studies or even book illustrations, and blooms from very different seasons were routinely included in the same composition, and the same flowers reappear in different works, just as pieces of tableware do. There was also a fundamental unreality in that bouquets of flowers in vases were not in fact at all common in houses at the time – even the very rich displayed flowers one by one in  [[delftware]] [[Tulipiere|tulip-holder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 111-112. Slive, 279-281, also covering unseasonal and recurring blooms.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch tradition was largely begun by [[Ambrosius Bosschaert]] (1573–1621), a Flemish-born flower painter who had settled in the north by the beginning of the period, and founded a dynasty. His brother-in-law [[Balthasar van der Ast]] (d. 1657) pioneered still lifes of shells, as well as painting flowers. These early works were relatively brightly lit, with the bouquets of flowers arranged in a relatively simple way. From the mid-century arrangements that can fairly be called Baroque, usually against a dark background, became more popular, exemplified by the works of [[Willem van Aelst]] (1627–1683). Painters from [[Leiden]], The Hague, and Amsterdam particularly excelled in the genre.

Dead game, and birds painted live but studied from the dead, were another subgenre, as were dead fish, a staple of the Dutch diet – [[Abraham van Beijeren]] did many of these.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 287-291&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dutch were less given to the Flemish style of combining large still life elements with other types of painting – they would have been considered prideful in portraits – and the Flemish habit of specialist painters collaborating on the different elements in the same work. But this sometimes did happen – Philips Wouwerman was occasionally used to add men and horses to turn a landscape into a hunting or skirmish scene, Berchem or Adriaen van de Velde to add people or farm animals.

==Foreign lands==
[[File:Gezicht op Olinda, Brazilië Rijksmuseum SK-A-742.jpeg|thumb|[[Frans Post]], scene in [[Dutch Brazil]]; painted in 1662, some years after the colony was lost.]]
For Dutch artists, Karel van Mander's ''Schilderboeck'' was meant not only as a list of biographies, but also a source of advice for young artists. It quickly became a classic standard work for generations of young Dutch and Flemish artists in the 17th century. The book advised artists to travel and see the sights of Florence and Rome, and after 1604 many did so.  However, it is noticeable that the most important Dutch artists in all fields, figures such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hals, Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael, and others, did not make the voyage.&lt;ref name="Fuchs, 43"/&gt;

Many Dutch (and Flemish) painters worked abroad or exported their work; [[printmaking]] was also an important export market, by which Rembrandt became known across Europe. The [[Dutch Gift]] to [[Charles II of England]] was a diplomatic gift which included four contemporary Dutch paintings. English painting was heavily reliant on Dutch painters, with Sir [[Peter Lely]] followed by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], developing the English portrait style established by the Flemish [[Anthony van Dyck]] before the [[English Civil War]]. The marine painters van der Velde, [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son]], were among several artists who left Holland at the French invasion of 1672, which brought a collapse in the art market. They also moved to London, and the beginnings of English landscape painting were established by several less distinguished Dutch painters, such as [[Hendrick Danckerts]].

The [[Bamboccianti]] were a colony of Dutch artists who introduced the genre scene to Italy.  [[Jan Weenix]] and [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] specialized in game and birds, dead or alive, and were in demand for country house and shooting-lodge [[overdoor]]s across Northern Europe.  

Although the Dutch control of the northeast sugar-producing region of [[Dutch Brazil]] turned out to be brief (1630-54), Governor [[Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen]] invited Dutch artists to paint scenes which are valuable in showing the seventeenth-century landscape and peoples of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdger Joppien. "The Dutch Vision of Brazil: Johan Maurits and His Artists," in ''Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, 1604-1679: A Humanist Prince in Europe and Brazil'', ed. Ernst van den Boogaart, et al. 297-376. The Hague: Johan Maurits van Nassau Stichting, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most well known of these artists were [[Frans Post]], a landscapist, and a still life painter, [[Albert Eckhout]], who produced ethnographic paintings of Brazil's population. These were originally displayed in the Great Hall of the Vrijburg Palace in [[Recife]].&lt;!--  Eckhout's drawings influenced [[Jan van Kessel]]'s {{dn}} work in Antwerp.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Groesen, ''Amsterdam's Atlantic'', pp. 171-72. With the Portuguese replacementr of the Dutch, Maurits gave the Vrijburg Palace paintings to [[Frederick III of Denmark]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a market in Amsterdam for such paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Michiel van Groesen, ''Amsterdam's Atlantic: Print Culture and the Making of Dutch Brazil''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press 2017, pp. 150-51.&lt;/ref&gt; and Post continued to produce Brazilian scenes for years after his return to the Netherlands.  The [[Dutch East Indies]] were covered much less well artistically.

==Subsequent reputation==
[[File:Philips Wouwerman - Travelers Awaiting a Ferry.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philips Wouwerman]], ''Travelers Awaiting a Ferry'' (1649); a landscape with Wouwerman's trademark highlight of a white horse.]]

The enormous success of 17th-century Dutch painting overpowered the work of subsequent generations, and no Dutch painter of the 18th century—nor, arguably, a 19th-century one before [[Van Gogh]]—is well known outside the Netherlands. Already by the end of the period artists were complaining that buyers were more interested in dead than living artists.

If only because of the enormous quantities produced, Dutch Golden Age painting has always formed a significant part of collections of [[Old Master]] paintings, itself a term invented in the 18th century to describe Dutch Golden Age artists. Taking only Wouwerman paintings in old royal collections, there are more than 60 in [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden]] and over 50 in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 212&lt;/ref&gt;  But the reputation of the period has shown many changes and shifts of emphasis. One nearly constant factor has been admiration for [[Rembrandt]], especially since the Romantic period. Other artists have shown drastic shifts in critical fortune and market price; at the end of the period some of the active Leiden [[fijnschilders]] had enormous reputations, but since the mid-19th century realist works in various genres have been far more appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;See Reitlinger, 11-15, 23-4, and ''passim'', and listings for individual artists&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermeer was rescued from near-total obscurity in the 19th century, by which time several of his works had been re-attributed to others. However the fact that so many of his works were already in major collections, often attributed to other artists, demonstrates that the quality of individual paintings was recognised even if his collective oeuvre was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;See Reitlinger, 483-4, and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other artists have continued to be rescued from the mass of little known painters: the late and very simple still lifes of [[Adriaen Coorte]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 319&lt;/ref&gt; and the landscapists [[Jacobus Mancaden]] and [[Frans Post]] earlier in the century.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 191-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerard ter Borch (II) 019.jpg|thumb|[[Gerard ter Borch]], ''[[The Gallant Conversation|Paternal Admonition]]'', or ''Brothel Scene'' (c. 1654; Amsterdam version).]]

Genre paintings were long popular, but little-regarded. In 1780 [[Horace Walpole]] disapproved that they "invite laughter to divert itself with the nastiest indelicacy of boors".&lt;ref&gt;"Advertisement" or Preface to Vol. 4 of the 2nd edition of ''Anecdotes of Painting in England'', based on [[George Vertue]]'s notebooks, page ix, 1782, J. Dodwell, London, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AzRo__K1AqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], the English leader of 18th-century [[academic art]], made several revealing comments on Dutch art. He was impressed by the quality of Vermeer's ''Milkmaid'' (illustrated at the start of this article), and the liveliness of Hals' portraits, regretting he lacked the "patience" to finish them properly, and lamented that Steen had not been born in Italy and formed by the [[High Renaissance]], so that his talent could have been put to better use.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 144 (Vermeer), 41-2 (Hals), 173 (Steen)&lt;/ref&gt;  By Reynold's time the moralist aspect of genre painting was no longer understood, even in the Netherlands; the famous example is the so-called ''[[The Gallant Conversation|Paternal Admonition]]'', as it was then known, by [[Gerard ter Borch]]. This was praised by [[Goethe]] and others for the delicacy of its depiction of a father reprimanding his daughter. In fact to most (but not all) modern scholars it is a proposition scene in a brothel – there are two versions (Berlin &amp; Amsterdam) and it is unclear whether a "tell-tale coin" in the man's hand has been removed or overpainted in either.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 158-160 (coin quote), and Fuchs, 147-8, who uses the title ''Brothel Scene''. Franits, 146-7, citing Alison Kettering, says there is "deliberate vagueness" as to the subject, and still uses the title ''Paternal Admonition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 18th century, the down to earth realism of Dutch painting was a "[[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] taste" in England, and in France associated with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] and aspirations for political reform.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, I, 11-15. Quote p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century, with a near-universal respect for realism, and the final decline of the hierarchy of genres, contemporary painters began to borrow from genre painters both their realism and their use of objects for narrative purposes, and paint similar subjects themselves, with all the genres the Dutch had pioneered appearing on far larger canvases (still lifes excepted).

In landscape painting, the Italianate artists were the most influential and highly regarded in the 18th century, but [[John Constable]] was among those Romantics who denounced them for artificiality, preferring the tonal and classical artists.&lt;ref name="Slive, 225"/&gt;  In fact both groups remained influential and popular in the 19th century.

}}'''Enrique Peña Nieto''' ({{IPA-es|enˈrike ˈpeɲa ˈnjeto|-|Penanieto.ogg}}; born 20 July 1966), commonly referred to by his initials '''EPN''', is a Mexican politician who served as the 57th [[President of Mexico]], from 2012 to 2018. He previously served in the [[State of Mexico]] as Secretary of Administration (2000–2002), Representative (2003–2004), and [[Governor of the State of Mexico|State Governor]] (2005–2011).&lt;!--There is a purposeful lack of citations in the lede of this article as per WP:WHENNOTCITE. The standard allows the lead to remain relatively cite-less if all the information is sourced in the main body. If there is something not cited in the lead AND not cited in the body, please a {{citation needed}} next to it so it can be addressed.--&gt;&lt;!--Do not add any information that violates Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, edits that do will be promptly reverted.--&gt;

Born in [[Atlacomulco]] and raised in [[Toluca]], Peña Nieto attended [[Panamerican University]] graduating with a B.A. in [[Jurisprudence|legal studies]]. He began his political career after attaining a M.B.A. from [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education|ITESM]], by joining the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) in 1984. After serving as a [[public notary]] in [[Mexico City]], he began an ascension through local political ranks in the late 1990s culminating in his 2005 campaign for Governor of the State of Mexico. As governor, &lt;!--Do not change without editor consensus. --&gt;he pledged to deliver 608 ''compromisos'' (promises) to his constituency to [[Enrique Peña Nieto#Governor of the State of Mexico: 2005–2011|varying levels of success]]. His tenure &lt;!--Do not change without editor consensus. --&gt; was marked by low-to-moderate approval of his handling of [[Crime in Mexico|a rising murder rate]] and various public health issues. He launched his [[Enrique Peña Nieto#Presidential campaign: 2011-12|2011 presidential campaign]] on a platform of economic competitiveness and [[open government]]. After performing well in polls and a series of high-profile candidate withdrawals, Peña Nieto was elected president with 38.14% of the vote.

During his first four years, &lt;!--Do not remove sentence and citation without editor consensus. --&gt; Peña Nieto led an expansive breakup of [[Monopoly|monopolies]], liberalized [[Energy in Mexico|Mexico's energy sector]], reformed public education, and modernized the [[Economy of Mexico|country's financial regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-mexicos-president-may-have-rescued-his-country/2016/10/14/5154235a-8ff1-11e6-9c52-0b10449e33c4_story.html|title=How Mexico’s president may have rescued his country|last=Tepperman|first=Jonathan|date=October 14, 2016|work=Washington Post|access-date=April 28, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, political gridlock and [[Enrique Peña Nieto#Domestic policy|allegations of media bias]], gradually worsened corruption, crime, and [[Mexican Drug War|drug trade in Mexico]]. He instated the multi-lateral [[Pact for Mexico]] which soothed inter-party fighting and led to increased legislation across the political spectrum. Global [[2010s oil glut|drops in oil prices]] and [[Great Recession|economic slowdown of the 2010s]], rendered his economic reforms moderately successful which lowered political support for Peña Nieto. His handling of the [[2014 Iguala mass kidnapping|Iguala mass kidnapping]] in 2014&lt;!--Do not remove sentence without editor consensus. --&gt; and escaped drug lord [[Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán]] from [[Altiplano prison]] in 2015 sparked international acclaim and criticism.

[[Enrique Peña Nieto#Evaluations as president and legacy|Historical evaluations]] and approval rates of his presidency have been mixed.&lt;!--Do not remove sentence without editor consensus. --&gt; Detractors highlight a series of failed policies and a strained public presence while supporters note increased economic competitiveness and loosening of gridlock.

==Early life and education==
Enrique Peña Nieto was born on 20 July 1966 in [[Atlacomulco]], [[State of Mexico]], a city {{convert|55|mi|km}} northwest of [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=earlylifenyt/&gt; He is the oldest of four siblings; his father, Gilberto Enrique Peña del Mazo, was an electrical engineer; his mother, María del Perpetuo Socorro Ofelia Nieto Sánchez, a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name=earlylifenyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Enrique Peña Nieto|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/enrique_pena_nieto/index.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 July 2012|first1=Randal C.|last1=Archibold|first2=Karla|last2=Zabludovsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the nephew of two former governors of the State of México: on his mother's side, [[Arturo Montiel]]; on his father's, [[Alfredo del Mazo González]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/12/28/the-pri-and-loathing-in-mexico-city/|title=The PRI and Loathing in Mexico City|date=28 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2013/12/16/the-10-most-corrupt-mexicans-of-2013/|title=The 10 Most Corrupt Mexicans of 2013|first=Dolia|last=Estevez|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelsedano.com/blog/2012/05/18/lo-que-quiza-no-sabes-de-enrique-pena-nieto/comment-page-1/|title=Lo que (quizá) no sabes de Enrique Peña Nieto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Denis Hall School in [[Alfred, Maine|Alfred]], [[Maine]], during one year of junior high school in 1979 to learn English.&lt;ref name=earlylifenyt/&gt; After living in Atlacomulco for the first 11 years of his life, Peña Nieto's family moved to the city of [[Toluca]].&lt;ref name=bebe&gt;{{cite news|last=Becerril|first=Andrés |title=Enrique Peña Nieto, su hoja de vida: pulcro y protegido |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=&amp;cat=443&amp;id_nota=830468 |accessdate=17 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Excélsior]] |date=30 April 2012 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914021405/http://excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota |archivedate=14 September 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, his father would often take him to the campaign rallies of the State of Mexico's governor, [[Jorge Jiménez Cantú]], a close friend of Peña del Mazo The successor of the governor was [[Alfredo del Mazo González]], a cousin of Peña Nieto's father. During Del Mazo González's campaign in 1981, the fifteen-year-old Peña Nieto had his first direct contact with [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican politics]]: he began delivering campaign literature in favor of his relative, a memory Peña Nieto recalls as the turning point and start of his deep interest in politics.

In 1984 at the age of 18, Peña Nieto traveled to [[Mexico City]] and enrolled in the [[Panamerican University]], where he earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in legal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Becerril |first=Andrés |title=Enrique Peña Nieto, su hoja de vida: despertar político |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=seccion-nacional&amp;cat=1&amp;id_nota=830745&amp;photo=0 |accessdate=17 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Excélsior]] |date=1 May 2012 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914021405/http://excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota |archivedate=14 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto's academic thesis was found to contain some improper citations and plagiarism which stirred controversy in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-pena-nieto-idUSKCN10X0BE|title=Mexican president Pena Nieto plagiarized law thesis, report says|date=22 August 2016|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thesis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=seccion-nacional&amp;cat=1&amp;id_nota=835373|title=Por sus tesis los conoceréis|last=Reyes|first=Juan Pablo|date=20 May 2012|newspaper=[[Excélsior]]|accessdate=17 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914021405/http://excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota|archivedate=14 September 2012|deadurl=yes|language=es|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto sought a master's degree in [[Business Administration]] ([[Master of Business Administration|MBA]]) at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, State of Mexico|Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey]] (ITESM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://noticias.terra.com.mx/mexico/politica/elecciones/sucesion-presidencial/enrique-pena-nieto-la-cara-joven-del-viejo-pri,f67eade28f5e6310VgnVCM5000009ccceb0aRCRD.html|title=Enrique Peña Nieto: La cara joven del viejo PRI|date=June 2012|newspaper=[[Terra Networks]]|accessdate=17 July 2012|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.presidencia.gob.mx/presidencia/presidente/ Biography Enrique Peña Nieto] – website of the President of Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; based in the State of Mexico.

==Political beginnings==
Peña Nieto joined the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) in 1984, and with a law degree nearly completed, he began earning his own money.&lt;ref name=homex&gt;{{cite news|last=Becerril |first=Andrés |title=Enrique Peña Nieto, su hoja de vida: echado pa'delante |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=seccion-nacional&amp;cat=1&amp;id_nota=830990 |accessdate=17 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Excélsior]] |date=2 May 2012 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914021405/http://excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota |archivedate=14 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his final years in college, Peña Nieto worked for a [[public notary]] in Mexico City, around the same time when his relative, Alfredo del Mazo González, was mentioned as a firm candidate for the [[Mexican general election, 1988|1988 presidential elections]].&lt;ref name=homex/&gt; In his twenties, he worked at the San Luis Industrial Corporation, an auto parts manufacturer, and at the law firm Laffan, Muse and Kaye. While still a student at the [[Universidad Panamericana]], he roomed with Eustaquio de Nicolás, the current president of [[Homex]], a leading Mexican construction and real estate company. He also befriended and roomed with Luis Miranda, who occupied several offices during the 1999–2000 administration in the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name=homex/&gt;

Peña Nieto formally started his political career under the mentorship of Montiel Rojas, becoming the Secretary of the Citizen Movement of Zone I of the State Directive Committee of the National Confederation of Popular Organizations (CNOP), one of the three sectors of the PRI. For three consecutive years, Peña Nieto participated as a delegate to the Organization and Citizen Front in [[Municipalities of the State of Mexico|different municipalities]] of the State of Mexico. Then, between 1993 and 1998, during Emilio Chuayfett's term as governor, Peña Nieto was chief of staff and personal secretary to Montiel Rojas, the Secretary of Economic Development of the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name=homex/&gt;

After 1999, Peña Nieto went from having low-level secretary positions to higher and more qualified offices.&lt;ref name=despegue&gt;{{cite news|last=Becerril |first=Andrés |title=Enrique Peña Nieto, su hoja de vida: un despegue firme |url=http://www.tvnws.com/2014/08/enrique-pena-nieto-su-hoja-de-vida-un-despegue-firme/ |accessdate=17 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Telenews]] |date=3 May 2012 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084156/http://www.tvnws.com/2014/08/enrique-pena-nieto-su-hoja-de-vida-un-despegue-firme/ |archivedate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served from 1999 to 2000 as the Sub-secretary of Government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lantigua|first=Isabel F.|title=Enrique Peña Nieto|url=http://www.elmundo.es/america/tags/b8/enrique-pena-nieto.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as financial sub-coordinator of the political campaign of Montiel Rojas.&lt;ref name=homex/&gt; In 2001, Montiel Rojas named Peña Nieto Sub-secretary of Interior in the State of Mexico, a position that granted him the opportunity to meet and forge relationships with top PRI politicians and wealthy businessmen. After his term concluded, he served as the administrative secretary, as president of the Directive Council of Social Security, as president of the Internal Council of Health, and as vice president of the [[National System for Integral Family Development]] – all in the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name=despegue/&gt; Under the wing of Montiel Rojas, Peña Nieto formed a group known as the "Golden Boys of Atlacomulco" with other members of the PRI.&lt;ref name="cipher"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico-pena-nieto-20120709,0,6191537.story|title=Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto, man of mystery|last=Wilkinson|first=Tracy|date=9 July 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of the State of Mexico (2005–2011)==
[[File:Enrique Peña Nieto - World Economic Forum on Latin America 2010.jpg|right|thumb|Peña Nieto at the [[World Economic Forum]] (2010)]]On 15 September 2005, Peña Nieto was sworn as [[governor of the State of Mexico]] at the Morelos theater in Toluca. Among the hundreds of attendees were the outgoing governor, [[Arturo Montiel]]; the president of the Superior Court of Justice, José Castillo Ambriz; former governors, members of Peña Nieto's cabinet and party, mayors, businessmen, and church figures.&lt;ref name="rindeprotesta"&gt;{{cite news|title=Seis años atrás: Peña Nieto asumió la gubernatura en el Teatro Morelos|url=http://edomex.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/75d9bcfb7cba54dfc1973e6f4755c588|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Milenio]]|date=12 September 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centerpiece of Peña Nieto's governorship was his claim that he was to deliver his ''compromisos'' – 608 promises he signed in front of a notary to convince voters that he would deliver results and be an effective leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindsay|first=James M.|title=Hola, Enrique Peña Nieto: President-Elect of Mexico|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/lindsay/2012/07/02/hola-enrique-pena-nieto-president-elect-of-mexico/|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'', during Peña Nieto's first year as governor, his administration delivered 10 of the structural promises he had advocated in his campaign – marking the lowest figure in his six-year term.&lt;ref name="islas"&gt;{{cite news|last=Islas|first=Laura|title=Los compromisos de Peña Nieto, año por año|url=http://www.eluniversaledomex.mx/toluca/nota21395.html|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=31 August 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006, his administration carried out 141 of the promised projects, making that year the most active in the governor's term. The 608 projects Peña Nieto proposed consisted of creating highways, building hospitals, and creating adequate water systems to provide fresh water throughout the state. The most important of these was highway infrastructure, which tripled under Peña's government. By mid-2011, the official page of the State of Mexico noted that only two projects were left.&lt;ref name="islas" /&gt; The major projects in public transportation were the [[Suburban Railway of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area]] and the "Mexibús", both of which served commuters between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, providing service to more than 300,000 people every day and 100 million a year. Regarding public health services, 196 hospitals and medical centers were built throughout the state and the number of mobile units to attend remote and vulnerable areas doubled.&lt;ref name="mexibus" /&gt; Deaths caused by [[respiratory disease]]s were reduced by 55%, while deaths caused by [[dysentery]] and [[cervical cancer]] were reduced by 68% and 25% respectively. In addition, between 2005 and 2011, the State of Mexico was able to fulfill the requirement of the [[World Health Organization]] of having one doctor for every 1,000 inhabitants. The funds for these and all the other commitments were obtained through restructuring the state's public debt, a strategy designed by his first Secretary of Finance, [[Luis Videgaray Caso]]. The restructuring also managed to keep the debt from increasing during Peña Nieto's term because the tax base was broadened to the point that it doubled in six years.&lt;ref name="mexibus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Islas|first=Laura|title=6to Informe.

Peña Nieto also claimed that he halved the murder rate in the State of Mexico during his time as governor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexto Informe de Gobierno: Enrique Peña Nieto|url=http://igecem.edomex.gob.mx/descargas/informe/6Tomo2.pdf|publisher=[[State of Mexico]]|accessdate=18 July 2012|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106012919/http://igecem.edomex.gob.mx/descargas/informe/6Tomo2.pdf|archivedate=6 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but retracted this claim after ''[[The Economist]]'' showed that the murder rate did not diminish and was being measured in a different way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crime in Mexico: The governor's miraculous achievement|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2011/09/crime-mexico|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yo Soy 132]] student movement criticized Peña Nieto for his stance on the [[San Salvador Atenco|San Salvador Atenco unrest]], which occurred during his term as governor.&lt;ref name="atenco132"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zapata|first=Belén|title=Atenco, el tema que 'encendió' a la Ibero y originó #YoSoy132|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2012/06/04/atenco-el-tema-que-encendio-a-la-ibero-y-origino-yosoy132|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=CNNMéxico|date=4 June 2012|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628223514/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2012/06/04/atenco-el-tema-que-encendio-a-la-ibero-y-origino-yosoy132|archivedate=28 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto stated in an interview that he does not justify the actions of the state and municipal forces, but also mentioned that they were not gladly received by the citizens of San Salvador Atenco upon their arrival.&lt;ref name="esmas"&gt;{{cite news |title=Justifica Peña Nieto uso de la fuerza en Atenco |url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/535173.html |accessdate=18 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Esmas.com]] |date=14 May 2006 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702005439/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/535173.html |archivedate=2 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atenco132" /&gt;

==Presidential campaign==
[[File:Enrique Peña Nieto (2013).jpg|thumb|Peña Nieto campaigning in 2012]]
On 23 November 2011, Peña Nieto went to a book fair in [[Casa del Lago Juan José Arreola|Casa del Lago]], Mexico City. There he presented his book ''México, la gran esperanza (Mexico, the great hope)''. He was accompanied by writer [[Héctor Aguilar Camín]], the former governor of Mexico's Central Bank, [[Guillermo Ortiz Martínez]], and the journalist Jaime Sánchez Susarrey. In the book, Peña Nieto argued that Mexico needed to expand its economy to create more jobs, insisting that in the past the country has only created jobs in the [[informal sector]].&lt;ref name="book1" /&gt; Additionally, he argued that promoting [[Pemex]] (Mexico's state-owned oil company) to compete in the private sector would create more jobs, elevate productivity, and balance wealth distribution across Mexico. Nonetheless, Peña Nieto dedicated the book to his wife [[Angélica Rivera]] and to governor [[Eruviel Ávila Villegas]] and his family.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Peña Nieto presenta su libro: México, la gran esperanza |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/4259178fb116421ada4be474aca6b3e9 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128224632/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/4259178fb116421ada4be474aca6b3e9 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Milenio]] |date=23 November 2011 |language=es }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto said that the return of the PRI marks a new era in Mexico, and that his book served as a starting point to take Mexico "to better horizons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cárdenas|first=Jesús|title=En la presentación de su libro, Enrique Peña Nieto dijo que México tiene ante sí la oportunidad de entrar a una nueva etapa de progreso|url=http://noticierostelevisa.esmas.com/elecciones-mexico/noticias/369786/enrique-pena-nieto-presenta-libro/|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Televisa]]|date=23 November 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2011, a few days after the book fair, Peña Nieto was the PRI's last standing nominee for the 2012 Mexican presidential elections. The former State of Mexico governor completed his nomination at an event that gathered sympathizers and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallardo|first=Arturo|title=The PRI's unity candidate|url=http://blog.mysanantonio.com/beyondtheborder/2011/11/the-pris-unity-candidate/|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[San Antonio Express-News]]|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days earlier, the senator and preliminary candidate of the PRI, [[Manlio Fabio Beltrones]], withdrew from the race and gave Peña Nieto a clear path towards the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manlio Fabio Beltrones anuncia su declinación a la candidatura del PRI|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/11/21/manlio-fabio-beltrones-anuncia-su-declinacion-a-la-candidatura-del-pri|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=CNNMéxico|date=21 November 2011|language=es|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715213454/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/11/21/manlio-fabio-beltrones-anuncia-su-declinacion-a-la-candidatura-del-pri|archivedate=15 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a book fair a month later, Peña Nieto's public image came into question after he struggled to answer a question that asked which three books had marked his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico top presidential contender can't name books |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-mexico-top-presidential-contender-cant-name-books-2011dec05-story.html|work=San Diego Union Tribune|first=Mark|last=Stevenson|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Peña Nieto was interviewed by ''[[El País]]'' and admitted that he did not know the price of [[tortillas]]. When he was criticized as being out of touch, Peña Nieto insisted that he was not "the woman of the household" and thus would not know the price.&lt;ref name=cnngaffes&gt;{{cite news|last=Navarrette Jr.|first=Ruben|title=Is Peña Nieto good news for Mexico?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/03/opinion/navarrette-mexico-election/index.html|accessdate=28 July 2012|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===

On 1 July 2012, Mexico's presidential election took place. In an initial, partial count issued that night, the [[Federal Electoral Institute (Mexico)|Federal Electoral Institute]] (IFE) announced that based on a fast vote counting, Peña Nieto was leading the election with 38% of the votes.&lt;ref name=6points&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Tracy|title=Enrique Peña Nieto wins Mexico's presidency, early results show|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/02/world/la-fg-mexico-presidential-election-20120702|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nearest competitor, [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]], was just 6 points behind him. The figures were meant to be a representative sample of the votes nationwide; but shortly after this announcement, Peña Nieto appeared on national television claiming victory. "This Sunday, Mexico won," he said. He then thanked his voters and promised to run a government "responsible and open to criticism." At the PRI headquarters in Mexico City, the victory party began.&lt;ref name=6points/&gt; With more than 97% of the votes counted on election day, the PRI had won with about 38% of the votes, just 6.4 points above the leftist candidate López Obrador of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] (PRD), who refused to concede to the results and had threatened to challenge the outcome.&lt;ref name=lopezobradorvotes&gt;{{cite news|title=Pena Nieto set to become Mexico's president|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/07/2012722615392786.html/|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jorgeramos20121121&gt;{{cite web|title=Jorge Ramos interviews Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador|url=http://jorgeramos.com/en/there-is-no-democracy-in-mexico/|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his inauguration speech at the National Palace, Peña Nieto proposed his agendas and reforms for the new administration.

The auto manufacturing industry expanded rapidly under Nieto's presidency. In 2014, more than US$10 billion was committed in investment in the sector. In conjunction with Kia Motors in August 2014, the president announced plans for Kia to build a US$1 billion factory in [[Nuevo León]]. At the time, [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Nissan]] were already building a US$1.4 billion plant near [[Puebla City|Puebla]], while [[BMW]] was planning a US$1 billion assembly plant in [[San Luis Potosí]].

According to the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS), between December 2012 and June 2016, more than two million jobs were created in Mexico. Of those jobs, 41% were taken by women and 36% were taken by individuals between 20 and 34 years of age. IMSS also revealed that 86% were long-term jobs and 14% were temporary. These jobs have led to a 26% increase in revenue accumulation for IMSS, an additional MXN$50 billion. More than half a million jobs had salaries worth five minimum wages (about MXN$10,000 per month) and there was a 22% increase in jobs with salaries greater than 20 minimum wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=México crea dos millones de empleos en tresose jobs, años|url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2016/07/08/actualidad/1467994934_768007.html|publisher=El País|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Special economic zones====
[[File:Enrique Peña Nieto and Mariano Rajoy at the 2017 G-20 Hamburg summit (2).jpg|thumb|Peña Nieto with Spanish Prime Minister [[Mariano Rajoy]], 8 July 2017]]At the end of May 2016, Peña Nieto signed a law that will create [[special economic zones]] in economically [[List of Mexican states by Human Development Index|underdeveloped southern states]]. The first three are: [[Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán|Lázaro Cárdenas]], Michoacán; [[Port Chiapas]], Chiapas; and in the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] to better join the ports of [[Coatzacoalcos]], Veracruz and [[Salina Cruz]], Oaxaca. Another zone in the petroleum region of Tabasco and Campeche, hit by the [[2010s oil glut|downturn in the oil industry]], is planned for 2017.&lt;ref name="WSJ Harrup"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrup|first1=Anthony|title=Mexican President Signs Law for Special Economic Zones|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special economic zones are meant to alleviate the lack of industry in the South. During the signing, Peña Nieto highlighted the difference between the South and the industrial North and Center of Mexico: two of every three people in [[extreme poverty]] in Mexico live in the southern states. While the three poorest states (Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero) have about 10% of the population, they only receive $1 of every $36 in [[foreign direct investment]] in the country. He went on to say that there are two Mexicos: one "that competes and wins in the [[global economy]], with growing levels of income, development and [[well-being]]", while the other Mexico "has been left behind [and] hasn't been able to take advantage of its potential."&lt;ref name="WSJ Harrup" /&gt;

The special economic zones will offer [[tax incentives]] (exemption from the 16% [[VAT]]),&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's special economic zones: How the bottom half lives|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21701134-free-trade-areas-aim-boost-growth-impoverished-south-how-bottom-half|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; trade and customs benefits and the streamlining of regulatory processes.&lt;ref name="WSJ Harrup" /&gt; There will also be an increase in infrastructure spending in these regions. Private administrators will run the zones on 40-year contracts (managing infrastructure and attracting tenants).&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; According to Peña Nieto, at the latest, each of these zones will have an anchor tenant that will attract suppliers and other industries in the [[supply chain]] by 2018.

Peña Nieto enacted a massive public education reform that would tame the powerful teachers' union, [[Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación]] (SNTE), improve standards, centralize the process for hiring, evaluating, promoting and retaining teachers, and crack down on rampant corruption – such as wages for non-existent “ghost teachers”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico's Pena Nieto enacts major education reform|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-21582629|work=BBC|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico’s education reforms flounder as more spent on PR than teacher training|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/mexico-education-reform-controversy-presidential-election|work=The Guardian|first=David|last=Agren|date=15 May 2018|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after its signing, the plan has barely affected standards: Mexico still ranks last in education among the 35 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] countries and the [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat of Public Education]] spent more money on communications (2,700% more on communications in 2017 than was budgeted) than on teacher training.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

While campaigning, Peña Nieto appointed a former general of the [[National Police of Colombia]] as his external advisor for public security, and promised to reduce the murder rate in Mexico by 50% by the end of his six-year term.&lt;ref name="unclear" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Daniel|title=Mexico candidate Peña Nieto seeks Colombia drug fighter as advisor|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/06/mexico-enrique-pena-nieto-oscar-naranjo-colombia.html|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Peña Nieto's security strategy, however, said that he offered "little sense" in exactly how he will reduce the violence.&lt;ref name="how" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unclear" /&gt; During the three-month campaign, Peña Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wondered whether he was holding back politically sensitive details or simply did not know how he would attempt to squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in [[Mexican Drug War|Mexico's drug war]].&lt;ref name="unclear"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gomez Licon|first=Adriana|title=New Mexican president could target small gangs|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/07/05/new-mexican-president-could-target-small-gangs/|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States officials were worried that the election of Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party may mean a return to the old PRI tactics of "corruption [and] backroom deals" with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace.&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Raf|title=Mexican election raises fears in Washington|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/9365421/Mexican-election-raises-fears-in-Washington.html|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 June 2012|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Raf|title=Presidential favorite worries U.S. officials as Mexicans head to polls|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Presidential+favourite+worries+officials+Mexicans+head+polls/6866616/story.html|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|date=30 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hQYVQKF?url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Presidential+favourite+worries+officials+Mexicans+head+polls/6866616/story.html|archivedate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the president-elect emphasized that he did not support the involvement or presence of armed United States agents in Mexico, but considered allowing the United States to instruct Mexico's military training in [[counterinsurgency]] tactics. Beyond that, Peña Nieto promised that no other measures will be taken by the States in Mexico.&lt;ref name="usaid"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's Pena Nieto Will Use US Help in Drug War|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/2012/07/06/mexico-pena-nieto-will-use-us-help-in-drug-war|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security policy of Peña Nieto has prioritized the reduction of violence rather than attacking Mexico's drug-trafficking organizations head-on, marking a departure from the strategy of the previous six years during [[Felipe Calderón]]'s administration. One of the biggest contrasts is the focus on lowering murder rates, kidnappings, and extortions, as opposed to arresting or killing the country's [[List of Mexico's 37 most-wanted drug lords|most-wanted drug lords]] and intercepting their drug shipments.&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Patrick|title=What Mexico's Elections Mean for Crime Policy: Part I|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2811-what-mexicos-elections-mean-for-crime-policy-part-i|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=InSight Crime|date=25 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hOifSrP?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2811-what-mexicos-elections-mean-for-crime-policy-part-i|archivedate=5 August 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2012, a law was approved that included far-reaching security reforms. Mexico's [[Secretariat of the Interior (Mexico)|Interior Ministry]], greatly strengthened by the bill, was made solely responsible for public security. Part of Peña Nieto's strategy consists of the creation of a national police of 40,000 members, known as a "[[gendarmerie]]". ''The Economist'' reported that the gendarmerie would have an initial strength of 10,000, but the Washington Office on Latin America reported that it was reduced to 5,000 members and would not be operational until July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Maureen &amp; Clay Boggs. {{cite news|title=One Year into Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto's Administration|url=http://www.wola.org/commentary/one_year_into_the_enrique_pena_nieto_administration|accessdate=20 February 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Office on Latin America]]|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interior Ministry announced that 15 specialized police units were being formed to exclusively focus on major crimes that include kidnapping and extortion, along with a new task force dedicated to tracking missing persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico's new government coming out swinging| url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21568729-plans-improve-security-and-schools-coming-out-swinging|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto also proposed centralizing the sub-federal police forces under one command.&lt;ref name="how" /&gt;

In December 2017, the [[:es:Ley de Seguridad Interior|Law of Internal Security]] was passed by legislation but was met with criticism, especially from the [[CNDH|National Human Rights Commission]], accusing it gave the President a [[wikt:carte blanche|blank check]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/AristeguiOnline/status/936399552122380292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/3011/mexico/mas-poder-al-presidente-y-a-las-fuerzas-armadas-las-entranas-de-la-ley-de-seguridad-interior/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://thewire.in/206138/mexican-national-human-rights-commission-likely-take-legal-action-security-law/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Mexico-Human-Rights-Watchdog-to-Challenge-Security-Law-in-Court-20171222-0023.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/mexicos-president-signs-internal-security-law-before-court-review-2017-12&lt;/ref&gt;

During the presidential campaign, Peña Nieto promised to open [[Pemex]], Mexico's state-owned oil company, to the [[private sector]]. He also indicated interest in an economic agreement with [[Petrobras]], Brazil's oil company.&lt;ref name="shanon"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neil|first=Shannon K.|title=Peña Nieto and Energy Reform|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/oneil/2012/07/12/pena-nieto-and-energy-reform/|accessdate=16 July 2012|newspaper=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By giving more economic freedom to Pemex, investors say Peña Nieto's proposal could allow joint ventures and private investment in the oil company.&lt;ref name="majority"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wheatley|first=Jonathan|title=Thinking of investing in Pemex?

According to the ''Financial Times'' in 2012, Peña Nieto's PRI government, which held just over 38% of the votes in Congress, might have difficulty gaining a majority to pass such reforms, or the [[supermajority#Two-thirds majority|two-thirds majority]] needed to change the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican constitution]].&lt;ref name="majority" /&gt; Pemex was founded through the nationalization of foreign oil interests, and the Mexican constitution bans major outside investments.&lt;ref name="exxon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Eric|title=Pena Nieto Push to Open Mexico Oil Fields Sparks Exxon Interest|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-12/pena-nieto-push-to-open-mexico-oil-fields-sparks-exxon-interest|accessdate=16 July 2012|newspaper=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=12 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514181702/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-12/pena-nieto-push-to-open-mexico-oil-fields-sparks-exxon-interest|archivedate=14 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing Pemex could transform the psychology of Mexico's business sector and involve cultural and political changes that cannot be rushed.&lt;ref name="majority" /&gt;&lt;ref name="exxon" /&gt; President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] seized foreign oil company assets in 1938 to form Pemex, which has served as a symbol of national identity.&lt;ref name="opec" /&gt;

Peña Nieto invited U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] to visit on 31 August 2016, and appeared with him in a press conference. Peña Nieto was criticized for extending the invitation to Trump,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splinternews.com/what-the-hell-was-president-enrique-pena-nieto-thinking-1793861547|title=We Want to Know — Why Would Peña Nieto Invite Trump to Mexico?|publisher=[[Splinter (website)|Splinter]]|author= Fernandez de Castro, Rafa|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and following the conference, journalist [[Jorge Ramos (news anchor)|Jorge Ramos]] criticized Peña Nieto for not using the opportunity to publicly contradict Trump's campaign promise to make Mexico pay for his proposed [[Mexico–United States barrier|Mexico–United States border wall]], as well as Ramos called Trump's "attacks on Latin American immigrants, his rejection of free trade agreements and his scorn for global organizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Jorge Ramos (news anchor)|Ramos, Jorge]]|url=http://splinternews.com/jorge-ramos-mexico-s-shrinking-president-1793861671|title=Jorge Ramos: Mexico's Shrinking President|publisher=Splinter|date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Peña Nieto stated on his Twitter that he made it clear to Trump that Mexico would not pay for the wall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=EPN|author=Enrique Peña Nieto|number=771118159654891520|date=31 August 2016|title=Al inicio de la conversación con Donald Trump dejé claro que México no pagará por el muro.}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to shortly after get a reply from Donald Trump saying: "Mexico will pay for the wall!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=realDonaldTrump|author=Donald J.

Peña Nieto and Trump were to meet on 26 January 2017, until Trump wrote on his Twitter account: "If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting". This directly led Peña Nieto to cancel his visit to the U.S. President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/01/26/mexico-stunned-by-trump-tweet-on-cancelling-trip.html|title=Mexico stunned by Trump tweet on cancelling trip|date=26 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/mexico-president-donald-trump-enrique-pena-nieto-border-wall/index.html|title=Mexican president cancels meeting with Trump|last=CNN|first=Daniella Diaz|website=CNN|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Aristegui Noticias, Washington periodist Dolia Estévez said she obtained access to part of a one-hour phone conversation between the two presidents the day of the scheduled meeting. She stated, "Trump humiliated Peña Nieto," and said that the conversation only lasted 20 minutes; she also explained that the speech was prolonged to an hour due to translation efforts because Peña Nieto doesn't understand English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.aristeguinoticias.com/0102/mundo/trump-humillo-a-pena-nieto-el-presidente-mexicano-balbuceo-dolia-estevez/|title=Aristegui Noticias|website=m.aristeguinoticias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/472688/trump-humillo-a-pena-lo-amago-enviar-sus-tropas-a-mexico-revela-dolia-estevez|title=Trump humilló a Peña y lo amagó con enviar sus tropas a México, revela Dolia Estévez - Proceso|date=1 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-mexican-president-opt-phone-call-visit-article-1.2957415|title=Trump, Mexican president opt for phone call instead of visit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many media outlets praised Peña Nieto for cancelling the visit with Trump, ''[[Forbes|Forbes Mexico]]'' stated that despite showing support towards Peña Nieto for cancelling such event, "that shouldn't translate in forgiveness to what happens within our country [Mexico]" adding that "a state incapable of bringing credibility and stability could not grow", and that more than Trump, the thing keeping Mexico from prosperity was the corruption within the Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com.mx/la-corrupcion-frena-nuestra-prosperidad-no-trump/#gs.EL1BQzc|title=Es la corrupción lo que frena nuestra prosperidad, no Trump|first=Daniela García Santibáñez|last=Godoy|date=31 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
====Social media manipulation and publicity excess====
As of July 2017, [[Oxford University]]’s Computational Propaganda Research Project claimed Mexico's social media manipulation ([[Peñabot]]s) to come directly from the Mexican Government itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/07/17/spreading-fake-news-becomes-standard-practice-for-governments-across-the-world/|title=Spreading fake news becomes standard practice for governments across the world|last=Timberg|first=Craig|date=17 July 2017|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/495268/gobierno-mexico-manipula-bots-las-redes-sociales-universidad-oxford|title=Gobierno de México manipula con "bots" las redes sociales: Universidad de Oxford - Proceso|date=17 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2017 article of ''[[The New York Times]]'', reported Enrique Peña Nieto spending about 2 billion dollars on publicity, during his first 5 years as president, the largest publicity budget ever spent by a Mexican President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/es/2017/12/25/con-su-enorme-presupuesto-de-publicidad-el-gobierno-mexicano-controla-los-medios-de-comunicacion-pri-pena-nieto/|title=Con su enorme presupuesto de publicidad, el gobierno mexicano controla los medios de comunicación|first=Azam|last=Ahmed|date=25 December 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ayotzinapa====
{{See also|2014 Iguala mass kidnapping}}
In September 2014, 43 male college students were forcibly taken then disappeared in [[Guerrero]]. The forced mass disappearance of the students arguably became the biggest political and public security scandal Peña Nieto had faced during his administration. It led to nationwide protests, particularly in the state of Guerrero and Mexico City, and international condemnation.

====Carmen Aristegui====
In November 2014, an article was published by journalist [[Carmen Aristegui]], indicating that a $7 million "White House" owned by Enrique Peña Nieto and his wife [[Angelica Rivera]], in [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] was registered under the name of a company affiliated with a business group that had received government contracts to build a bullet train.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/luxurious-presidential-house-draws-mexican-press-scrutiny/2014/11/09/33bba1ee-65fd-11e4-ab86-46000e1d0035_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The revelation about the potential [[conflict of interest]] in the acquisition of the house aggravated discontent about the government. Rivera released a video in which she detailed her income as a former soap opera actress, stating that she was selling the house and that the property was not under her name because she had not made the full payment yet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/135880a6-6fc2-11e4-90af-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3KAeQBOPA&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after revealing the Mexican White House incident, Carmen Aristegui was controversially fired from her radio show at [[MVS Comunicaciones|MVS Communications]]. As noted by ''The New York Times'', Aristegui being fired was a perceived as a censorship towards news journalism and the liberty given by the freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/world/americas/in-mexico-firing-of-carmen-aristegui-highlights-rising-pressures-on-news-media.html&lt;/ref&gt; Aristegui took it to trial and by June 2018, three years after MVS fired her, the jury determined that it was indeed unconstitutional and against the law, to fire her and indeed was an act of censorship towards the freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/2106/mexico/ya-hay-sentencia-fue-ilegal-el-despido-de-aristegui-de-mvs-video/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/06/despido-aristegui-mvs-ilegal/&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto's successor in the presidency of Mexico, [[Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador]], promised Aristegui would be free to return to radio if she wanted and that there would be no more unfair censorship towards the freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/1508/mexico/amlo-asegura-que-procurara-el-regreso-de-carmen-aristegui-y-jose-gutierrez-vivo-a-la-radio/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Aristegui revealed in a special report arguing that Enrique Peña Nieto could have committed plagiarism on his law thesis, at least a third of it, with 197 out of 682 paragraphs being  unsourced or wrongly sourced works.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/4461186/mexican-president-plagiarize-law-thesis/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allegations of espionage on journalists====
During his tenure as president, Peña Nieto has been accused of failing to protect news journalists, whose deaths are speculated to be politically triggered, by politicians attempting to prevent them from covering political scandals. ''The New York Times'' published a news report on the matter titled, "''In Mexico it's easy to kill a journalist''", on it mentioning how Mexico became one of the worst countries in which to be a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/world/americas/veracruz-mexico-reporters-killed.html|title=In Mexico, ‘It’s Easy to Kill a Journalist’|first=Azam|last=Ahmed|date=29 April 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2017, ''The New York Times'' in conjunction with news reporter [[Carmen Aristegui]], and even backed by a ''[[Televisa]]'' news reporter [[Carlos Loret de Mola]], reported that the Mexican Government uses a [[spyware]] [[software]] known as [[Pegasus (spyware)|Pegasus]], to spy on targets such as Mexican News reporters (and their families) and Civil Rights Leaders (and their families) using text messages as lures. Since 2011, the Mexican Government invested $80 million worth of spyware. Pegasus spyware infiltrates a persons cellphone and reports every detail of their messages, e-mails, contacts and calendars.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/world/americas/mexico-spyware-anticrime.html|title=Using Texts as Lures, Government Spyware Targets Mexican Journalists and Their Families|first1=Azam|last1=Ahmed|first2=Nicole|last2=Perlroth|date=19 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/19/mexico-cellphone-software-spying-journalists-activists|title=Mexico accused of spying on journalists and activists using cellphone malware|first=David|last=Agren|date=19 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allegations of corruption====
''The New York Times'' published an article of December 2017, describing accusations towards Peña Nieto's government blocking its own investigations against corruption in the Mexican government, with a commissioner saying the Mexican government preventing the establishment of an impartial leader in the FEPADE in charge of investigating political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/world/americas/mexico-corruption-commission.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previously mentioned 22 ex-governors all members of the PRI political party are investigated for corruption with only five jailed.

By March 2018 in the dawn of the next presidential election, the PGR made official an investigation regarding PAN's candidate Ricardo Anaya laundering money. Ex-chief of FEPADE (the Mexican government's branch focused on political crimes), Santiago Nieto, whom the previous October had been controversially removed from his job as chief of FEPADE, coincidentally right after starting an investigation regarding illicit campaign money from the 2012 presidential campaign, received by Peña Nieto and would be president of [[Pemex]], [[Emilio Lozoya]] from the Brazilian conglomerate [[Odebrecht]]. The ex-chief of FEPADE, said that the accusations towards Anaya were minor in comparison to Odebretch and Peña Nieto scandal, adding also the same opinion about the money lost by SEDESOL, to corrupt governors from the PRI such as [[Javier Duarte]] and Cesar Duarte, all while PRI's presidential candidate Jose Antonio Meade was the man in charge of SEDESOL (the scandal is known as "La Estafa Maestra (The Master Robbery)" and about $435 million pesos were lost).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/01/robles-meade-estafa-maestra-sedesol/&lt;/ref&gt; The same week the PRI legislators were criticized for voting towards stopping the investigation of Odebretch against the wishes of Mexican people and organizations against corruption such as "Mexicanos contra la corrupcion (Mexicans against Corruption)".&lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/internacional/2018/03/07/actualidad/1520390316_791182.html&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation about Odebretch against [[Pemex]] leader at the time Lozoya, was legally stopped after, a judge controversially ordered it days after.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.culturacolectiva.com/noticias/jueza-suspende-investigacion-contra-lozoya-por-tiempo-indefinido/&lt;/ref&gt; Satiago Nieto said that the PGR was being used as tool by Peña Nieto's government to tamper elections and benefit Meade by removing Anaya from the race, complaining that it was not neutral the manner in whom the law enforcing organizations had made more effort to investigate Anaya in a month than towards investigating Peña Nieto's Odebretch money and Meade's SEDESOL lost money in the last six years. Going as far as saying the PGR and FEPADE were only attacking the rivals of the PRI, and saying the organizations were not being neutral.&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/0203/mexico/por-menos-que-lo-que-ha-hecho-la-pgr-contra-anaya-me-removieron-a-mi-santiago-nieto/&lt;/ref&gt;

Javier Duarte went to jail in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-corruption/jailed-former-mexican-governor-starts-hunger-strike-over-witch-hunt-idUSKCN1AY0D8&lt;/ref&gt; though, Cesar Duarte despite the overwhelming evidence against him, in March 2018, the PGR found him innocent of any crime. The successor governor Javier Corral from the PAN, who previously fought against the [[Televisa|Televisa law]], gave a similar opinion to Santiago Nieto, saying the PGR was being used to protect the allies of Peña Nieto and the PRI, and attack their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/articulo/default.aspx?id=1346330&amp;md5=2f59936ad96e8f39cfeaa31398842aa7&amp;ta=0dfdbac11765226904c16cb9ad1b2efe&amp;hootPostID=b87bc35a1b1c3e2e80eff9c658ae612b&lt;/ref&gt; AMLO said that not preceding towards Duarte, is one of the main reasons Mexicans lost their faith in the PRI, saying the few ex-governors declared criminals were only to simulate they care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.proceso.com.mx/526180/por-acciones-como-no-proceder-contra-cesar-duarte-la-gente-ya-no-le-cree-al-pri-amlo&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Santiago Nieto would later reveal that Peña Nieto's government tried to bribe him to keep him silent, which he refused saying “Sorry, but I can’t receive any money from Peña Nieto.”, he received menaces through phone messages with the words "Death follows you" and "Words of advice: stay out of Trouble", as a consequence he revealed to fear for the life of himself and his family.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-mexican-prosecutor-says-he-was-fired-to-stymie-corruption-probe-1521062636&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian conglomerate [[Odebrecht]], accused of corruption and bribes throughout Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41109132&lt;/ref&gt; is currently under investigation for allegedly overriding the Peña Nieto's presidential campaign with illegal campaign funds. In exchange oe the campaign money supposedly Peña Nieto gave Odebrecht contracts through state-owned [[Pemex]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/entrada-de-opinion/columna/salvador-garcia-soto/nacion/2017/08/14/odebrecht-pago-campana-de-epn&lt;/ref&gt; An Odebrecht employee told a Brazilian court that he had been asked to pay a bribe to [[Emilio Lozoya Austin]], then head of Pemex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Odebrecht Testimony in Brazil Points to Pemex Bribe in Mexico: Ex-official of Brazilian construction firm testified he was asked to pay $5 million to then-chief of Mexican oil company |publisher=Wall Street Journal |author=Juan Montes |date=5 May 2017 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/odebrecht-testimony-in-brazil-points-to-pemex-bribe-in-mexico-1494025050 |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Amparo" and "Fuero" requests against a possible political trial====
An "amparo" is a Mexican right, it can be used by anyone accused of a crime or multiple crimes, this gives them the right to know which crimes they are being accused of. It is mostly used by people expecting to go to trial, and is used to allow the prosecuted person to build a defense with the help of a lawyer. Peña Nieto is the first president in the history of Mexico to use this right, not only for himself but also for all of his collaborators during his presidency of Mexico. He took the right about an investigation regarding actions concerning the state of Chihuahua, it is feared he may have tampered the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;https://regeneracion.mx/amparo-de-epn-y-su-gabinete-porque-algo-hicieron-y-temen-que-los-alcance-la-justicia-fiscal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another right for prosecuted people is the "fuero", which Peña Nieto is also the first president in the history of Mexico to request. This right is exclusive to political figures, and is the right to be protected against legal trials and acusations of corruption committed during their time in office. Through this, he legally delayed any progress in the investigations against him, until the end of his presidency in December 2018, when the investigation will be allowed to continue.&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/2110/mexico/gobierno-de-pena-nieto-busca-anular-investigaciones-del-fuero-comun-contra-funcionarios-federales/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of media bias===
'''Televisa'''

''[[Televisa]]'', the largest conglomerate broadcasting in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries, was accused of tilting their coverage towards Peña Nieto ahead of the [[Mexican general election, 2012|July 1 vote]]. Thousands of university students protested of the perceived bias throughout Mexico City and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico students protest alleged media bias|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/05/201252492924104136.html|work=Al Jazeera|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexicans protest against 'media bias'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/10/mexicans-protest-against-media-bias|work=The Guardian|first=Jo|last=Tuckman|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico youth protest media's flattering coverage of Enrique Peña Nieto|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-05-24/mexico-youth-protest-medias-flattering-coverage-enrique-pe-nieto-photos|work=PRI|first=Alex|last=Leff|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2018, ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Jo Tuckman reported about dozens of computer files – forwarded to ''The Guardian'' by a source who worked with ''Televisa'' but hasn't been possible to confirm the authenticity of the documents – suggesting that ''Televisa'' sold favorable coverage to Peña Nieto when he was governor of the state of Mexico and developed a [[smear campaign|dirty tricks campaign]] against López Obrador ahead of his first bid for the presidency in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer files link TV dirty tricks to favourite for Mexico presidency|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/mexico-presidency-tv-dirty-tricks|work=The Guardian|first=Jo|last=Tuckman|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Televisa'' and the PRI suggested that the documents were false.

'''Time Magazine'''

On the March 24, 2014 weekly [[Time (magazine)|Time]] issue, Peña Nieto was issued on the front cover with the headline, "Saving Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;http://content.time.com/time/covers/pacific/0,16641,20140224,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was credited for having passed social, political, and economic reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Mexico's New Mission|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2165465-1,00.html|work=Time|first=Michael|last=Crowley|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front cover was met with widespread disapproval of the Mexican public, prompting various spoofs on social media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enrique Pena Nieto’s TIME Cover Sparks Outrage In Mexico (PHOTOS)|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/17/enrique-pena-nieto-time_n_4803677.html|work=Huffington Post|first=Carolina|last=Moreno|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time magazine just made lots of enemies in Mexico|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-02-15/time-magazine-just-made-lots-enemies-mexico|work=PRI|first=Alex|last=Leff|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; even prompting a petition to have him removed from the cover.

===Evaluations as president and legacy===
In August 2016, Peña Nieto's approval ratings dropped to 23 percent (74 percent said they disapproved of his performance), which newspaper ''Reforma'' revealed to be the lowest approval rating for a president since they began polling in 1995.&lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/why-mexican-president-enrique-pe-nieto-so-unpopular-n640611|title=Why Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is so unpopular|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approval decreased to 12% by January 19, 2017.&lt;ref name="Eric Martin @EMPosts More stories by Eric Martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-18/mexico-s-pena-nieto-approval-falls-to-12-after-gasoline-soars|title=Mexican President's Support Plumbs New Low as Gasoline Soars|author=Eric Martin @EMPosts More stories by Eric Martin|date=|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 presidential elections, the lack of popularity and credibity of Peña Nieto's government, is perceived to have caused his political party the PRI, to suffer its most monumental defeat, getting the least percentage of votes in the history of the PRI. The candidate [[Jose Antonio Meade]], and the political party did not win majority of votes within any of the 300 voting locations around the 32 states of Mexico, losing to other political parties. The PRI was also defeated, on each of the nine elections for state governors where MORENA won five, PAN three, and [[Citizens' Movement (Mexico)|Citizens' Movement]] one. The presidency of Mexico went to [[Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador]], from MORENA.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/07/morena-logra-5-de-9-gubernaturas-pri-pierde/&lt;/ref&gt; The PRI also lost to MORENA in [[Atlacomulco]], the hometown of Enrique Peña Nieto.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/elecciones-2018/el-pri-perdio-en-atlacomulco-cuna-de-enrique-pena-nieto&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://regeneracion.mx/pena-nieto-pierde-hasta-atlacomulco-ante-morena/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Critical pedagogy}}
{{Feminism sidebar}}
In [[composition studies]], [[feminism]] is generally focused on giving feedback while taking into account gender difference. Thus, an instructor with a [[feminist pedagogy]] is unlikely to favor an androcentric method of teaching. A feminist approach in composition "would focus on questions of difference and dominance in written language".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Flynn, Elizabeth. "Composing as a Woman." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston:
Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 243–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
In the 1960s, the second wave of feminism began and one major goal was to raise society’s consciousness of the struggles of women. The goals of feminists were largely carried out in university classrooms. Specifically, in the composition classroom, Faye Spencer Moar claimed that the way writing was taught largely favored male writers.&lt;ref&gt;Moar, Faye Spencer. "Part One: Introduction." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary P Hiatt claimed that women implicitly write differently than men, and that men tended to write in the dominant, most oft taught style.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Hiatt, Mary P. "The Feminine Style: Theory and Fact." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston:
Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiatt argues that the terms "masculine" and "feminine" are applied to styles of writing–that of men and women, respectively–but, instead of describing the style, what is actually described is the male views on both men and women. Her examples include "strong", "rational", and "logical" for men, and "emotional", "hysterical", and "silly" for women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Thus, the aim of feminism in composition studies was to create a classroom in which women perceived themselves intellectually and in which their voices were relevant in what some feminists perceive to be an androcentric world.

==Pedagogy==
[[Elizabeth Flynn]] writes that feminist theory "emphasize[s] that males and females differ in their developmental processes and in their interactions with others".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Thus, a feminist instructor will take into account the implicit differences between male and female writers and teach appropriately, without favoring or focusing on androcentric or gynocentric studies. [[Feminist pedagogy]] involves reading texts written by women, and taking care to understand those texts are not simply appropriations of texts written by men, without any sort of critique of androcentrism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Focus is also placed upon the reading and reviewing of student-created texts. Feminist instructors try to create a supportive classroom environment and validate student’s experiences.&lt;ref name="Jarratt 2003. 263–280"&gt;Jarratt, Susan C. "Feminism and Composition: The Case for Conflict." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston:
Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 263–280.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Jarratt]] mentions a feminist pedagogy that advocates women writing about "personal experiences after reading women’s autobiography, history, and fiction".&lt;ref name="Jarratt 2003. 263–280"/&gt;

One style of feminist theory that is being utilized in the composition classroom is the theory of Invitational Rhetoric. Sonja K. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin, &lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K,. and Cindy L. Griffin. "Beyond Persuasion: A Proposal for an Invitational Rhetoric." Communication Monographs 62.1 (1995) 2-18.&lt;/ref&gt; first proposed the idea of Invitational Rhetoric as "grounded in the feminist principles of equality, imminent value and self-determination" (5). Originally this was considered a communication theory. More recently, it has grown across curriculums, including the use in English composition classrooms. As a newer philosophy in English composition, the use of invitational rhetoric is used as a way to make students feel comfortable in the classroom setting. By using Foss and Griffin’s Invitational Rhetoric theory as a guide in conducting classes, instructors are able to encourage their students to share their beliefs and learn to respect others opinions, without having to feel like opposite views are being force-fed to them in a way that would cause them to turn away from debate or discussions that could foster critical thinking. According to Foss and Griffin, Invitational Rhetoric works through the use of debate and discussion as a way to learn about various viewpoints, with the freedom to ultimately make up one’s own minds about the topic. Abby Knoblauch &lt;ref&gt;Knoblauch, A. Abby. "Disrupting Disruption: Invitational Pedagogy as." Disrupting Pedagogies in the Knowledge Society: Countering Conservative Norms with Creative Approaches:Countering Conservative Norms with Creative Approaches (2011): 122.&lt;/ref&gt;describes the use of Invitational Rhetoric as a way to make sure conservative students are not put on the offensive by more liberal teachers and their ideals. By using Invitational Rhetoric as a guide in presenting material, an instructor can in turn foster a student’s creativity and encourage them to write about what is important to them.

==Research==
Flynn researched the narratives of her first-year composition students for their disparities. She says, "The narratives of the female students are stories of interaction, of connection, or of frustrated connection. The narratives of the male students are stories of achievement, of separation, or of frustrated achievement".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Feminist research "tries to arrive at hypotheses that are free of gender loyalties," says Patricia A. Sullivan.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sullivan, Patricia A. "Feminism and Methodology in Composition Studies." Feminism and Composition: A Critical Sourcebook. Kirsch, Gail E., ed. Boston:
Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2003. 124–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] lists three characteristics of feminist research in her book ''Feminism and Methodology'' that Sullivan deems appropriate for consideration into feminist studies of composition, not just the social sciences, which is what Harding is concerned with. These characteristics are, first, using women’s experiences as an "indicator of the realist against which hypotheses are tested." Second, the research is "designed for women" and provides "social phenomena that [women] want or need." Third, it "insists that the inquirer her/himself be placed in the same critical plane as the overt subject matter" .&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Sullivan believes these three characteristics are relevant to composition studies because of the common practice to conduct research from a standpoint that is gender-neutral (neither men over women, nor vice versa), gender-inclusive (considering both male and female perspectives, processes, and styles, not just those of females), and researcher disinterestedness (the common practice of keeping one’s self out of the research process in order to allow for an unbiased analysis).

{{distinguish|Transformation geometry}}

A '''geometric transformation''' is any [[bijection]] of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] having some geometric structure to itself or another such set. Specifically, "A geometric transformation is a function whose domain and range are sets of points. Most often the domain and range of a geometric transformation are both R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or both R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Often geometric transformations are required to be 1-1 functions, so that they have inverses." &lt;ref&gt;Zalman Usiskin, Anthony L. Peressini, [[Elena Marchisotto]] – ''Mathematics for High School Teachers: An Advanced Perspective'', page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[geometry]] may be approached via the study of these transformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Gerard A.|last=Venema|title=Foundations of Geometry|year=2006|publisher=[[Pearson Prentice Hall]]|isbn=9780131437005|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometric transformations can be classified by the dimension of their operand sets (thus distinguishing between planar transformations and those of space, for example). They can also be classified according to the properties they preserve:
* [[displacement (vector)|displacement]]s preserve [[distance]]s and [[angle|oriented angles]];
* [[Isometry|isometries]] preserve angles and distances;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{google books |id=pN0iAVavPR8C|

page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Similarity (geometry)|similarities]] preserve angles and ratios between distances;
* [[affine transformation]]s preserve [[parallelism (geometry)|parallelism]];&lt;ref name=Berger /&gt;
* [[projective transformation]]s preserve [[collinearity (geometry)|collinearity]];&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;Leland Wilkinson, D. Wills, D. Rope, A. Norton, R. Dubbs – ''{{google books|id=NRyGnjeNKJIC|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these classes contains the previous one.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson /&gt;

*[[Circle inversion]] preserve the set of all lines and circles in the planar case (but may interchange lines and circles), and [[Möbius transformation]]s conserve all planes and spheres in dimension 3.

'''Geumgang jeondo''' (금강전도 金剛全圖) is a famous landscape painted by [[Jeong Seon]] during the reign of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]]. The title literally means "General view of Mt. [[Kumgangsan|Geumgangsan]]" or The Diamond Mountains).&lt;ref name="Koreandb"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ideal of Korean people: Geumgang jeondo |url=http://www.koreandb.net/OldPaint/op_sansu07_1.htm |publisher=[[Empas]]/ [[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512235729/http://www.koreandb.net/OldPaint/op_sansu07_1.htm |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was classified as the 217th [[National Treasures of South Korea|National Treasure of South Korea]] on August 6, 1984. The painting is currently held and managed by the [[Ho-Am Art Museum]] in [[Yongin]], [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi Province]] and is owned by [[Lee Kun-hee]].

While many contemporaneous painters imitated the latest art trends from China, Jeong Seon ignored these to create unique themes based on Korean landscapes.  His catalogue of paintings of Geumgansan made him famous and the preeminent painter of his time at the age of 37.  He eventually painted around 100 images of the mountains which still exist to this day.  The artist’s love of the mountains influenced other artists to depict the Diamond Mountains and even encouraged mapmakers to make maps of the area.

Although Jeong Seon made many paintings of Mt. Geumgangsan, this painting is the largest and considered his best.  Like many of his paintings, Jeong Seon painted this landscape while actually viewing the mountains.  The painting is 130.7 centimeters in height and 94.1 centimeters in width.  It is painted with India ink.  The painting is of Naegeumgang, the Inner Mt. Geumgangsan.  The painting depicts a total of twelve thousand peaks.  The highest peak, Birobong, lies in the background and water flows from it toward a valley called Manpokdong which is divided from the left and right. The high sharp peaks are depicted by the artist with lines painted up and down while the artist used a dotting brush method to depict the earthen peaks, making them appear relatively soft and lush.  This composition harmonizes the contrasting sharp edges of the rocky peaks with the softer earthen peaks.
  
The painter included the title of the painting, some comments, and his pen name, Gyeomjae, in the upper right hand corner.  The inscription also dates the painting to 1734 when Jeong Seon was 59 years old.  The artist’s comments reads: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Even if you visit the mountain yourself and tread on its every nook and cranny, how can your joy be compared with what you feel upon viewing this picture from your bedside?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film stars [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Kate McKinnon]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], [[Charles Dance]], [[Michael Kenneth Williams]], and [[Chris Hemsworth]]. It is the third feature film in the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]], and serves as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series. The story focuses on four women who begin a [[Ghost hunting|ghost-catching]] business in New York City.

A third ''Ghostbusters'' film had been in various stages of development following the release of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989. As a result of original cast member [[Bill Murray]]'s refusal to commit to the project and the death of fellow cast member [[Harold Ramis]] in 2014, Sony decided to reboot the series. Much of the original film's cast make [[cameo appearance]]s in new roles. The announcement of the female-led cast in 2015 drew a polarized response from the public and Internet backlash,&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite web|author=Zack Sharf |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/ghostbusters-scene-change-internet-backlash-1201703854/ |title=‘Ghostbusters’ Reboot Added New Scene As Reaction To Internet Backlash |publisher=IndieWire |date=2016-07-08 |accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the film's [[IMDb]] page and associated [[YouTube]] videos receiving low ratings prior to the film's release.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Britt|title=‘Ghostbusters’ Haters Spam IMDb With Low Ratings|url=http://screencrush.com/ghostbusters-imdb-what-the/|website=ScreenCrush|accessdate=19 November 2017|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickey"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hickey|first1=Walt|title=‘Ghostbusters’ Is A Perfect Example Of How Internet Movie Ratings Are Broken|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ghostbusters-is-a-perfect-example-of-how-internet-ratings-are-broken/|website=FiveThirtyEight|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Physicists Abby Yates and Erin Gilbert are authors of a research book which posits the existence of paranormal phenomena, such as ghosts. While Abby continued to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Jillian Holtzmann, Erin, now a professor at [[Columbia University]], disowned the work, fearing it will impact her [[Academic tenure|tenure]]. When Abby republishes the book, Erin convinces her to agree to remove the book from publication in exchange by helping Abby and Jillian in a paranormal investigation. They witness a malevolent ghost, restoring Erin's belief in the paranormal, but video footage of the investigation is posted online, and Erin is fired by the university. She joins Abby and Jillian to set up new offices above a Chinese restaurant, calling themselves "Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination". They build equipment to study and capture ghosts, and hire the dimwitted but handsome Kevin Beckman as a [[receptionist]].

[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] staffer Patty Tolan witnesses a ghost in a subway line and contacts the group. They document the ghost and successfully test Jillian's [[Proton pack|proton containment laser]], but their findings are again dismissed. They continue to develop their technology and advertise their services with the name pundits have labeled them, "Ghostbusters". Patty joins the team, providing historical knowledge of New York City and a repurposed [[hearse]], "[[Ecto-1]]".

Unbeknownst to the Ghostbusters, the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an [[occultist]] attempting to bring about the [[apocalypse]]. When Rowan plants another device at a live music venue, the Ghostbusters are called in and capture the ghost in front of the audience. When supernatural [[debunker]] Dr. Martin Heiss challenges the Ghostbusters, the incensed Erin releases the ghost as proof; it throws Heiss out a window and escapes. The Ghostbusters are brought to Mayor Bradley and his secretary Jennifer Lynch, who reveal that the city and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) are aware of New York's ghost problem. While privately supporting the team's work, the mayor's office and the DHS publicly denounce them as fraudsters.

The Ghostbusters realize that Rowan is planting his devices along [[ley line]]s, which intersect at the Mercado Hotel in [[Times Square]], a site with a history of paranormal activity, and discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement. To avoid capture, Rowan commits suicide by electrocuting himself, after which Jillian deactivates the portal.  Erin discovers a copy of her and Abby's book among Rowan's possessions and realizes that he killed himself so he could become a ghost and command a spirit army.  Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, possessing Abby and then Kevin. As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts. The police and DHS are subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.

Rowan takes the form of the ghost in the Ghostbusters' logo, grows to enormous height, and attacks the city. The team devises a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension. The plan succeeds, but Rowan drags Abby into the portal with him; Erin leaps into the portal and rescues her as Rowan is obliterated. The mayor's office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters' research while continuing to publicly denounce them as frauds. With new funding, the Ghostbusters move to a better facility, a disused fire house. New York lights up with thanks and tributes to the Ghostbusters. Patty hears something unusual in a recording and asks: "What's '[[w:Ghostbusters|Zuul]]'?"

==Production==

===Development===
A third ''Ghostbusters'' film had been in various stages of development following the release of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref name="Murrayexplains"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connell|first1=Sean|title=Bill Murray Finally Explains Why He Kept Passing On Ghostbusters 3|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Bill-Murray-Finally-Explains-Why-He-Kept-Passing-Ghostbusters-3-67711.html|website=Cinema Blend|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/471237/long-troubled-history-newghostbustersmovie-timeline|title=The long, troubled history of the new Ghostbusters movie: A timeline|first=Scott| last=Meslow|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[The Week]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Murray]], who played Ghostbuster [[Peter Venkman]] in the original films, was reluctant to participate as he felt ''Ghostbusters II'' had been lackluster and was critical of new scripts he had read. [[Dan Aykroyd]], who co-starred in and co-wrote the original films, stated that the studio was aware that "without Murray there may be nothing there" for a sequel, and was considering a way to introduce a new generation of Ghostbusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/ghostbusters-reboot-will-bill-murray-return-in-smaller-role-1201330132/|title=‘Ghostbusters’ Reboot: Will Bill Murray Return in Smaller Role?|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One script, ''Ghostbusters 3: Hellbent'', written by Aykroyd in 1999, had Venkman leaving the Ghostbusters to spend time with [[Sigourney Weaver]]'s character Dana Barrett; the remaining Ghostbusters, including a new younger member, fought souls that had been evicted from a hellish version of Manhattan known as Manhelltan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/07/30/ign-filmforce-exclusive-the-stax-report-script-review-of-ghostbusters-3-hellbent|title=IGN Filmforce Exclusive: The Stax Report: Script Review of Ghostbusters 3: Hellbent!|author=Stax|date=July 30, 2002|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hellbent'' script was revised as ''Ghostbusters in Hell'', with plans to replace Murray with [[Ben Stiller]]. The story had the Ghostbusters finding a portal to an alternate dimension in which "all the worst things about modern urban life" are "magnified"; traffic is stuck in perpetual gridlock and no two people speak the same language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/ramis-plans-ghostbusters-3-with-stiller-57152611/|title=Ramis Plans ‘Ghostbusters 3’ with Stiller|date=November 6, 2005|accessdate=July 29, 2016|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another story idea had Venkman transformed into a ghost.&lt;ref name="Murrayexplains" /&gt;

While the third film remained in development, ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' was developed by [[Terminal Reality]] and released in 2009. Aykroyd and [[Harold Ramis]], cowriters of the original films, used the game to explore the Ghostbusters{{'}} history; all four original actors, including Murray, voiced their characters, along with other actors from the original films. Aykroyd considered the game "essentially the third movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/dan-aykroyd-on-ghostbusters-game/|title=Dan Aykroyd on Ghostbusters game|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=Now Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game sold over a million units, prompting [[Columbia Pictures]] to move forward on the ''Ghostbusters'' franchise. Ramis stated that the new film would feature the original Ghostbusters but introduce new characters in a script written by [[Lee Eisenberg]] and [[Gene Stupnitsky]], who had cowritten his 2009 comedy ''[[Year One (film)|Year One]].'' The movie was set to be filmed in 2010 and released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heebmagazine.com/ramis-on-_ghostbusters-3_-plans-to-shoot-next-summer-and-release-in-2011|title=Ramis on Ghostbusters 3: "Plans to Shoot Next Summer and Release in 2011"|first=Brian|last=Abrams|date=December 29, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Heeb Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/features/columbia-calls-up-new-ghostbusters-1117991624/|title=Columbia calls up new ‘Ghostbusters’|first=Michael|last=Flemming|date=September 4, 2008|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around March 2010, while the new script was being developed, ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'' reported that Columbia wanted to target a younger audience and that original ''[[Ghostbusters (film)|Ghostbusters]]'' director [[Ivan Reitman]] was under pressure to step down in place of a younger director. Reitman, along with Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis, had long-standing contracts in place with Columbia that effectively allow any of them to veto the development of a ''Ghostbusters'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/03/ghostbusters_3_ivan_reitman.html|title=Vulture Exclusive: Columbia Wants a Younger Director for Ghostbusters III, But Ivan Reitman’s Contract Says Otherwise|first=Claude|last=Brodesser-Akner|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=March 17, 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray had told ''[[GQ]]'' in 2010 that he felt the script written by Eisenberg and Stupnitsky was poor and "that dream just vaporized", but said that Columbia was pressuring him to make it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/bill-murray-dan-fierman-gq-interview|title=Bill Murray Is Ready To See You Now|first=Dan|last=Fierman|date=July 18, 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[GQ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aykroyd defended the script, saying that it offered Murray "the comic role of a lifetime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/10/dan-akroyd-writing-ghostbusters-3-script-selling-vodka-out-of-his-rv|title=DAN AYKROYD WRITING GHOSTBUSTERS 3 SCRIPT, SELLING VODKA OUT OF HIS RV|first=Susan |last=Michels|date=October 5, 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012 Aykroyd stated that the film was in "suspended animation" as Murray was still uncooperative. Aykroyd refused to recast the role as he would not make a film that "exploits the franchise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/9097816/Dan-Aykroyd-a-comedy-legends-spiritual-side.html|title=Dan Aykroyd: a comedy legend's spiritual side|first=Chrissey|last=Iley|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2012, the Eisenberg and Stupnitsky script had been discarded and new writers were working on a script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/ghostbusters-3/|title=Dan Aykroyd Says GHOSTBUSTERS 3 Has a New Writing Team | first=Dave|last=Trumbore|date=July 3, 2012|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray's reluctance to commit to the project resulted in the decision to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the franchise instead.&lt;ref name="Murrayexplains" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-ghostbusters-3-1783369285|title=The Rise and Fall of Ghostbusters 3|last=Lussier|first=Germain|language=English|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Reitman suggested a remake of the original ''Ghostbusters'', which would allow them to introduce a new cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/ivan-reitman-lauren-shuler-donner-dave-blu-ray-interview/|title=Ivan Reitman and Lauren Shuler Donner Talk DAVE on Blu-ray, How Gary Ross Got Involved, As Well As Sequel News for GHOSTBUSTERS and TWINS|last=Radish|first=Christia|date=September 24, 2012|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=Collider.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reitman was working on a ''Ghostbusters'' reboot that would be filmed during 2013, with [[Etan Cohen]], Aykroyd, and himself working on the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2012/10/paramount-punts-kevin-costners-draft-day-is-tom-cruises-our-name-is-adam-next-355415/|title=Paramount In Talks For Tom Cruise Pic ‘Our Name Is Adam,’ But Studio Punts Ivan Reitman/Kevin Costner’s ‘Draft Day’|last=Flemming Jr.|first=Mike|date=October 17, 2012|accessdate=July 29, 2016|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline ramis death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/03/ghostbusters-movie-going-forward-without-ivan-reitman-sony-701057/|title=Third Installment Of ‘Ghostbusters’ A Go For Early 2015; Death Of Pal Harold Ramis Prompts Ivan Reitman To Turn Over Directing Reins|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|date=March 18, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2016|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/104516-dan-aykroyd-reveals-new-ghostbusters-3-plot-details|title=Dan Aykroyd Reveals New Ghostbusters 3 Plot Details|last=Lenchek|first=Silas|date=May 20, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Comingsoon.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Ramis's death in February 2014, Reitman decided to leave the director role to focus on smaller projects, but remained a producer to help Columbia and Sony find a new director for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/director-ivan-reitman-backs-out-of-ghostbusters-sequel-20140319|title=Director Ivan Reitman Backs Out of 'Ghostbusters' Sequel|last=Reed|first=Ryan|date=March 19, 2014|accessdate=July 28, 2014|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the script featured the original Ghostbusters in minor roles.&lt;ref name="deadline ramis death" /&gt;

Or tell a story you've seen before, but in a way you haven't seen it."&lt;ref name="Feig at NYDN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/ghostbusters-director-paul-feig-responds-attacks-article-1.2621647|title=‘Ghostbusters’ director Paul Feig responds to attacks on his all-female reboot|last=Klickstein|first=Mathew|date=May 2, 2016|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feig said that [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]]'s co-chairman [[Amy Pascal]] had been pushing for comedy writers to produce a script for a new ''Ghostbusters'' film for some time, but he believed that most of these writers, like himself, did not want to ruin the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] of the original films. He also wanted to avoid a premise similar to ''Ghostbusters II'', in which the Ghostbusters have to lose their success to begin a new story. This led to the idea of a reboot featuring a new set of characters, an idea that Pascal agreed with.&lt;ref name="wired feig july2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/paul-feig-ghostbusters-qa/|title=Ghostbusters Director Paul Feig Talks Haters, Slime, and Sexism|last=Rafterty|first=Brian|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
In January 2015, Feig confirmed his intention to use [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Kate McKinnon]], and [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]] in the lead roles. At that point, McCarthy had already committed to the film while Sony was in negotiations with the other three actresses.&lt;ref name="CastTweeted"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/Ghostbusters-female-cast-taking-shape-at-sony-1201415358/|title=‘Ghostbusters’ Female Cast Taking Shape at Sony|date=January 27, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/new-all-female-ghostbusters-cast-767610|title=New All-Female 'Ghostbusters' Cast Chosen|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=January 27, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma Stone]] was approached to star but declined partly because she did not want to commit to a franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/emma-stone-talks-irrational-man-the-sony-hack-and-keeping-her-personal-life-private-1434547660?tesla=y|title=Emma Stone Talks ‘Irrational Man,’ the Sony Hack and Keeping Her Personal Life Private|date=June 17, 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|last1=Eells|first1=Josh|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily Strong]], who appears in a supporting role, was also considered for a leading role.&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.filmdivider.com/9016/paul-feig-has-carved-out-great-role-in-Ghostbusters-just-for-cecily-strong/|title=Paul Feig has carved out a great role in Ghostbusters just for Cecily Strong|date=February 17, 2015|work=Film Divider|last1=Cunningham|first1=Joe|accessdate=June 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621225527/http://www.filmdivider.com/9016/paul-feig-has-carved-out-great-role-in-ghostbusters-just-for-cecily-strong/|archivedate=June 21, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aykroyd stated that he and his family were "delighted by this inheritance of the ''Ghostbusters'' torch by these most magnificent women in comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dan-aykroyd-new-ghostbusters-cast-767943|title=Dan Aykroyd: New 'Ghostbusters' Cast Is "Magnificent"|last=McDermott|first=Emmet|date=January 28, 2015|accessdate=July 20, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===
Six companies dealt with the 1,700 [[visual effects]] shots, under the supervision of Pete Travers. The main studios were [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], with 300 shots that included the climactic Times Square sequence and all the proton beams,&lt;ref name=PMZ&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romanello|first1=Lina|title=Ghostbusters: MPC tackles the paranormal|url=http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2016/August-1-2016/-i-Ghostbusters-i-MPC-tackles-the-paranormal.aspx|website=Post Magazine|accessdate=December 1, 2017|date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), with 250 shots that centered around the final battle which included Rowan's monster form,&lt;ref name=PMZ/&gt; and Australian company Iloura, with 500 shots encompassing various ghosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/iloura-gets-spooky-ghostbusters|date=July 21, 2016|title=Iloura Gets Spooky for ‘Ghostbusters’|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority of the work involved [[computer-generated imagery]], there was an attempt to use various practical effects akin to the original movies, with Travers explaining it was done "not to pay homage, but because it was the best way to achieve the effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18414-ghostbusters-reboot-vfx-slimer-and-stay-puft-as-cgi|title=How 'Ghostbusters' Reboot Revived Slimer and Stay Puft as CGI|last=Failes|first= Ian|date=July 18, 2016|publisher=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stand-ins for the ghosts were created on the set for the actors to interact with, including actresses suspended by wires, [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]s as references for flying ghosts, a [[Slimer]] puppet and giant balloons for a [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]] parade balloon. As the ghosts in the film glow, the doubles were covered in [[light-emitting diode]]s to provide lighting references for the effects crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giardina|first1=Carolyn|title='Ghostbusters': How the Visual Effects Team Brought Slimer and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man Back to Life|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/ghostbusters-how-visual-effects-team-911727|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=9 August 2017|language=en|date=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Failes|first1=Ian|title=Crossing Streams: A Step-by-Step Guide to the VFX of ‘GHOSTBUSTERS’|url=http://oneperfectshotdb.com/news/crossing-streams-a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-vfx-of-ghostbusters/|website=Film School Rejects|accessdate=December 1, 2017|date=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climactic Times Square sequence, which starts with the antagonist proclaiming "Welcome to the glory days of New York City", used special effects to transform it into a [[Times Square#1960s–1980s|bygone mix]] of stores, buildings and billboards dating back through the decades, including [[Bond Clothing Stores#New York City|Bond Clothing Store]], neon signs for the defunct airlines [[Braniff International Airways]] (ended in 1982) and [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] (ended in 1974), billboards advertising the release of the 1976 film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and the 1971 film ''[[Isle of the Snake People]]'' and the 1962 to 1964 [[Broadway theatre]] production of ''[[Beyond the Fringe#International Success|Beyond the Fringe]]'', a combination of the [[Sony]], [[Canadian Club]] and [[Coca-Cola]] neon signs that light up Times Square in different eras, marquees for long departed Times Square movie theatres showing [[Pornography|XXX]] films and the 1971 film ''[[Fists of Fury]]'', and other chronological anachronisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/how-ghostbusters-re-created-a-bizarro-times-211201128.html |title=How 'Ghostbusters' Re-Created a Bizarro Times Square |last=Korn |first=Steve |work=[[Yahoo!

''Ghostbusters'' received criticism from [[social media]] users following word of Feig's involvement and the all-female cast, which some felt was a "gimmick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/04/showbiz/movies/paul-feig-ghostbusters/|title='Ghostbusters' reboot: Paul Feig, and an all-women cast?|last=Hare|first=Breeanna|date=August 4, 2014|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its first day of release, the first trailer for the film collected 12,000 "likes" and 13,800 "dislikes" from YouTube viewers which, according to David Griner of ''[[Ad Week]]'' made it "one of the most polarizing in recent memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/reactions-all-female-ghostbusters-trailer-prove-itll-be-most-polarizing-movie-year-169984|title=Reactions to the All-Female Ghostbusters Trailer Prove It'll Be the Most Polarizing Movie of the Year|last=Griner|first=David|date=March 3, 2016|publisher=Ad Week|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2016, the trailer had become the most disliked film trailer on YouTube&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-36191146|title=Ghostbusters trailer 'most disliked' on YouTube|date=May 3, 2016|work=BBC News|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ninth-[[List of most-disliked YouTube videos|most-disliked YouTube video]], with 280,000 likes to over one million dislikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/youtube-dislikes-controversy-sonys-new-895442|title=After YouTube "Dislikes" Controversy, Sony's New 'Ghostbusters' Trailer Debuts Elsewhere First|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=May 18, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/all-female-ghostbusters-already-fending-controversy|title=All-female ‘Ghostbusters’ already fending off controversy|last=Howard|first=Adam|date=March 9, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/6/30/12027882/ghostbusters-reboot-all-female-backlash-sexism-sony|title=How the all-female Ghostbusters reboot became a lightning rod of controversy|last=Framke|first=Caroline|date=July 15, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ScreenCrush]] described the reaction as a campaign "to downvote [the film] into oblivion" by "a certain subset of people on the internet [with] an unhealthy fixation with hating on the ''Ghostbusters'' remake".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/ghostbusters-trailer-most-disliked-movie-trailer-in-history/?trackback=tsmclip|title=Why the ‘Ghostbusters’ Trailer Is the Most ‘Disliked’ Movie Trailer in YouTube History|date=April 29, 2016|last1=Sampson|first1=Mike|work=Screen Crush|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one interview, Melissa McCarthy felt it was a "very, very, very tiny, tiny group of people" who were misogynistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/entertainment/ghostbuster-melissa/2954166.html|title=Ghostbuster Melissa McCarthy on who she wants to slime in real life|first=Genevieve Sarah|last= Loh|publisher=Channel News Asia|date=July 13, 2016|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons proposed for the negative reaction to the trailer included a lack of interest in reboots, nostalgia for the original film, and a perceived lack of humor in the trailer.&lt;ref name="atlantic outcry"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/the-sexist-outcry-against-the-ghostbusters-remake-gets-louder/483270/|title=The Ongoing Outcry Against the Ghostbusters Remake|date=May 18, 2016|website=The Atlantic|last1=Sims|first1=David|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's [[IMDb]] page was also subject to a coordinated effort to lower its rating prior to the film's release.&lt;ref name="Hayes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickey"/&gt;

Todd Martens of the ''Los Angeles Times'' suggested that fans felt "entitled" to a film that preserved the franchise as they imagined it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-comic-con-fan-entitlement-20160722-snap-story.html|title=Creators, fans and death threats: Talking to Joss Whedon, Neil Gaiman and more on the Age of Entitlement|last=Martens|first=Todd|date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Mashable, Ivan Reitman said "I think there’s way too much talk about gender [when it comes to this film]" and "I think that many of the people who were complaining were actually lovers of the [original] movie, not haters of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coggan|first1=Devan|title=Original 'Ghostbusters' director Ivan Reitman: Reboot backlash due to nostalgia, not sexism|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/06/30/ghostbusters-ivan-reitman-reboot-backlash-sexism/|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=9 August 2017|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some saw the portrayal of [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]' character, a "street-smart New Yorker", as a [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotype of African Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/ghostbusters-leslie-jones-character-criticised-for-a6909681.html|title=Anger over 'add-on' black character in new Ghostbusters film|date=March 3, 2016|website=The Independent|last1=Clarisse|first1=Loughrey|accessdate=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/21/12239704/ghostbusters-is-still-haunted-by-negative-racial-tropes|title=Ghostbusters is still haunted by negative racial tropes|date=July 21, 2016|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|last1=D|first1=Tanya|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson |first1=Janessa E. |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/08/ghostbusters-remake-not-feminist-black-women |title=They call this Ghostbusters reboot feminist.

However, journalists from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Atlantic]]'' stated that a majority of the criticism constituted [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] and anti-[[Feminism|feminist]] comments in regard to the all-female cast.&lt;ref name="atlantic outcry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="People hate at WP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/03/04/people-are-hating-the-ghostbusters-trailer-guess-why/|title=People hate the ‘Ghostbusters’ trailer, and yes, it’s because it stars women|last=Merry|first=Stephanie|date=March 4, 2016|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiig was "bummed out" that "there was so much controversy because we were women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-mn-conversation-kristen-wiig-nasty-baby-20151025-story.html|title=With 'Nasty Baby,' Kristen Wiig is officially crazy-busy|last=Olsen|first=Mark|date=October 23, 2015|accessdate=July 20, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feig said he believed a group of fans had "real issues with women. But there’s also a huge group of people who are just concerned about the property, and I completely understand. I’m completely sympathetic to that."&lt;ref name="wired feig july2016"/&gt; In May 2016, additional scenes were shot for the film which served as a [[meta-reference]] to the Internet controversy. In those scenes, the characters upload a video to YouTube and react to unpleasant comments left by viewers.&lt;ref name="indiewire"/&gt;

Filmmaker [[James Rolfe]] declared that he would not see the new film and disliked how it was based in a new universe with no continuity to the previous films.&lt;ref name="atlantic outcry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes rolfe 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/ghostbusters-frozen-and-strange-entitlement-fan-cu-237139|title=Ghostbusters, Frozen, and the strange entitlement of fan culture|last=Hassenger|first=Jesse|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2016|work=[[The A.V.

While speaking at [[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture Festival LA]] in November 2017, Feig expressed regret that the [[social issue]]s surrounding ''Ghostbusters'' negatively impacted its public perception and commercial performance, stating that "I think it kind of hampered us a little bit because the movie became so much of a cause. I think for some of our audience, they were like, 'What the fuck? We don't wanna go to a cause. We just wanna watch a fuckin' movie'". However, he expressed satisfaction with his work on the film and defended it, explaining "It was a great regret in my life that the movie didn't do better, 'cause I really loved it. It's not a perfect movie. None of my movies are perfect. I liked what we were doing with it. It was only supposed to be there to entertain people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferber|first1=Taylor|title=Paul Feig Regrets That His Ghostbusters Remake Turned Into a ‘Cause’|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/paul-feig-regrets-that-ghostbusters-remake-became-a-cause.html|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=2017-11-21|language=en|date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony partnered with [[Snapchat]] to promote the film with "busting" and "sliming" features.

=== Title ===
The end credits use the title ''Ghostbusters: Answer the Call.'' Feig said this was added by the studio, who wanted to avoid confusion by having two films of the title ''Ghostbsusters''. He rejected the title ''Ghostbusters 2016'', feeling it would date it. The studio chose ''Answer the Call''; according to Feig, "I just said, 'Don’t put it on the front of the movie. If you put it on the end, I don’t care.'"&lt;ref name="Lussier" /&gt;

In a June 2017 television appearance, Aykroyd blamed the film's underperformance on Feig.

===Critical response===
&lt;!--Please see talk page before adding or changing summarized critical reception. Last consensus was omission of summarized reception.--&gt;On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Ghostbusters'' has an approval rating of 74%, based on 350 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Ghostbusters'' does an impressive job of standing on its own as a freewheeling, marvelously cast supernatural comedy—even if it can't help but pale somewhat in comparison with the classic original."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghostbusters_2016/ |title=Ghostbusters (2016) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="Meta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ghostbusters-2016 |title=Ghostbusters Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cinemascore/status/754160672703819776 |title=''Ghostbusters'' |publisher=[[CinemaScore]] on [[Twitter]] |date=July 15, 2016 |accessdate=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers under 18 gave it a higher score of "A-".&lt;ref name="thr"/&gt;

[[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the film as "that rarest of big-studio offerings—a movie that is a lot of enjoyable, disposable fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/movies/ghostbusters-review-melissa-mccarthy-kristen-wiig.html|title=Our ‘Ghostbusters’ Review: Girls Rule.

Smith awarded the film four out of five stars and wrote that the "mean-spirited reception to the film before anyone had seen it does not seem to have put a dampener on the movie itself.

==Future of the franchise==

After its opening weekend, Sony's president of worldwide distribution, Rory Bruer, told [[TheWrap]] that "while nothing has been officially announced, there's no doubt in my mind [a sequel] will happen." He also said that ''Ghostbusters'' was expected to become an important Sony franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Venter |first=Jason |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/18/12211904/ghostbusters-sequel-sony |title=Sony has plans for a Ghostbusters sequel |publisher=Polygon |date=2016-07-18 |accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal cast and Feig had signed on for two sequels.&lt;ref name="HWR8"/&gt;

On August 10, 2016, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' expressed doubts about a sequel due to the film's box office performance.&lt;ref name="HWR8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VFLoss"/&gt; Box office analyst Jeff Bock said, "I just can't fathom the creative talents behind it—Feig, McCarthy, Wiig, etc—slogging out another one when the reception to the first one was so mediocre."&lt;ref name="HWR8"/&gt;

In an October 2016 interview, Feig told ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' that a sequel was not in the works, but could be possible if the film performed well on its [[home video|home release]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/189427-a-ghostbusters-sequel-could-still-happen-if-holtzmann-fans-show-their-support-says-director-paul-feig|title=A 'Ghostbusters' Sequel Could Still Happen If Holtzmann Fans Show Their Support, Says Director Paul Feig|first=Rachel|last=Simon|date=October 24, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November, Feig confirmed that a direct sequel would not be made due to the film's mediocre box office performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityherald.com/articles/51482/20161124/ghostbusters.htm|title=Sequel to Ghostbusters Reboot Not Happening According To Director|date=November 24, 2016|work=University Herald|accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, Reitman stated in an interview that other ''Ghostbusters'' projects were in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/future-ghostbusters-movies/ |title=Ivan Reitman Says There Are "Many" More ‘Ghostbusters’ Movies in Development |last=Anderton |first=Ethan |publisher=[[/Film]] |date=November 28, 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mMXD54ta?url=http://www.slashfilm.com/future-ghostbusters-movies/ |archivedate=November 28, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Reitman's announcement, an animated series, ''Ghostbusters: Ecto Force'', was stated to be targeting an early 2018 debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Sony Unveils Plans for Animated 'Spider-Man' and 'Emojimovie: Express Yourself'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sony-unveils-plans-animated-spider-904574|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 20, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reitman further clarified plans for future animated films within the ''Ghostbusters'' franchise during the July 2017 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], including having one set from the viewpoint of the ghosts rather than the Ghostbusters, as well as a work to potentially tie in to the 35th anniversary of the original film in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Auty|first1=Dan|title=Future Ghostbusters Movies Teased, Including New Animated Film|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-ghostbusters-movies-teased-including-new-an/1100-6451882/|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=21 July 2017|date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, [[IDW Publishing]] announced that it would release a six-part [[Limited series (comics)|limited series comic]], ''Ghostbusters 101'', featuring the original Ghostbusters teaming up with the 2016 team. The first issue was released in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/32477-ghostbusters-to-meet-1984-originals-in-ghostbusters-101.html |title=GHOSTBUSTERS To Meet 1984 Originals in GHOSTBUSTERS 101 |publisher=Newsarama |date=2016-12-21 |accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A five-issue limited series, ''Ghostbusters: Answer the Call'', which continues the adventures of the 2016 team, began in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Arrant |url=https://www.newsarama.com/35441-all-girl-ghostbusters-gets-their-own-idw-title.html |title=The New GHOSTBUSTERS Gets Their Own IDW Title |publisher=Newsarama |date=2017-07-19 |accessdate=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Dan Aykroyd, on a appearance on [[AXS TV]]'s ''The Big Interview'' with Dan Rather, announced that the script for ''Ghostbusters 3'' was still being written, saying there is "a possibility of a reunion with the three remaining Ghostbusters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sam Moore |title=Dan Aykroyd gives another update on 'Ghostbusters 3' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/dan-aykroyd-ghostbusters-3-update-2402563 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=November 15, 2018 |date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dan Aykroyd Says Script for Ghostbusters 3 Is Being Written Right Now |url=https://screenrant.com/ghostbusters-3-dan-aykroyd-script/ |website=[[Screen Rant]] |accessdate=November 15, 2018 |date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''Great Moon Hoax'''" refers to a series of six articles that were published in ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a New York newspaper, beginning on August 25, 1835, about the supposed discovery of life and even civilization on the [[Moon]]. The discoveries were falsely attributed to Sir [[John Herschel]], one of the best-known [[astronomer]]s of that time.

The story was advertised on August 21, 1835, as an upcoming feature allegedly reprinted from ''[[Edinburgh Courant|The Edinburgh Courant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maliszewski, Paul. "Paper Moon," ''Wilson Quarterly''. Winter 2005. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The first in a series of six was published four days later on August 25.

==Article==
[[File:1836 the-great-moon-hoax-new-inhabitants-of-the-moon.png|thumb|right|220px|Portrait of a man-bat ("''Vespertilio-homo''"), from an edition of the Moon series published in [[Naples]]]]

The headline read:

{{cquote|
&lt;center&gt;GREAT ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;LATELY MADE&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;BY SIR JOHN HERSCHEL, L.L.D. F.R.S. &amp;c.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''At the [[Cape of Good Hope]]'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[From Supplement to the [[Edinburgh]] Journal of Science]&lt;/center&gt;
}}

The articles described fantastic animals on the Moon, including [[bison]], [[goats]], [[unicorn]]s, [[bipedal]] tail-less [[beavers]] and [[bat]]-like winged humanoids ("''Vespertilio-homo''") who built temples. There were trees, oceans and beaches. These discoveries were supposedly made with "an immense [[telescope]] of an entirely new principle."

The author of the narrative was ostensibly Dr. Andrew Grant, the travelling companion and [[amanuensis]] of Sir John Herschel, but Grant was fictitious.

Eventually, the authors announced that the observations had been terminated by the destruction of the telescope, by means of the [[Sun]] causing the lens to act as a "[[burning glass]]," setting fire to the observatory.&lt;ref name="AsimovGunn1975"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gunn |first1=James E. |authorlink1=James Gunn (author) |last2=Asimov |first2=Isaac |authorlink2=Isaac Asimov |title=Alternate worlds: the illustrated history of science fiction |date=1975 |publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]] |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |isbn=0-89104-049-8 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
Authorship of the article has been attributed to Richard Adams Locke (1800–1871),&lt;ref Name="Deseret"&gt;{{Cite news |title=They Formed A Pair |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xaZOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hkIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6760,5192821 |newspaper=[[Deseret News|The Deseret Weekly]] |publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company |location=Salt Lake City, UT |date=May 13, 1893 |page=665 |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/locke_richard_adams |title=Locke, Richard Adams |first1=John |last1=Clute |first2=John |last2=Eggeling |website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |accessdate=November 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reporter who, in August 1835, was working for ''The Sun''. Locke publicly admitted to being the author in 1840, in a letter to the weekly paper ''New World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=Matthew |date=2008 |title=The Sun and the Moon |location=New York |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |page=274 |isbn=978-0-465-00257-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, rumours persisted that others were involved. Two other men have been noted in connection with the [[hoax]]: [[Joseph Nicollet|Jean-Nicolas Nicollet]],&lt;ref Name="Deseret" /&gt; a French astronomer travelling in America at the time (though he was in Mississippi, not New York, when the Moon-hoax issues appeared), and [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', a literary magazine. However, there is no good evidence to indicate that anyone but Locke was the author of the hoax.

Assuming that Richard A. Locke was the author, his intentions were probably, first, to create a sensational story which would increase sales of ''The Sun'', and, second, to ridicule some of the more extravagant astronomical theories that had recently been published. For instance, in 1824, [[Franz von Gruithuisen|Franz von Paula Gruithuisen]], professor of Astronomy at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]], had published a paper titled "Discovery of Many Distinct Traces of Lunar Inhabitants, Especially of One of Their Colossal Buildings." Gruithuisen claimed to have observed various shades of color on the lunar surface, which he correlated with climate and vegetation zones. He also observed lines and geometrical shapes, which he felt indicated the existence of walls, roads, fortifications, and cities.

However, a more direct object of Locke's satire was Rev. [[Thomas Dick (scientist)|Thomas Dick]], who was known as "The Christian Philosopher" after the title of his first book.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Rh4PAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=thomas+dick+christian+philosopher&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Christian Philosopher]''&lt;/ref&gt; Dick had computed that the [[Solar System]] contained 21,891,974,404,480 (21.9 trillion) inhabitants. In fact, the Moon alone, by his count, would contain 4,200,000,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dick |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Dick (scientist) |title=Celestial Scenery; or, The Wonders of the Planetary System Displayed: Illustrating the Perfections of Deity and a Plurality of Worlds |url=https://archive.org/download/celestialscener00dick/celestialscener00dick.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |origyear=First published London 1837; New York 1838 |date=1845 |publisher=Edward C. Biddle |location=Philadelphia |pages=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were enormously popular in the [[United States]], his fans including intellectual [[wikt:luminaries|luminaries]] such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

==Reaction and effect==
According to legend, ''The Sun''{{'}}s circulation increased dramatically because of the hoax and remained permanently greater than before, thereby establishing ''The Sun'' as a successful paper. However, the degree to which the hoax increased the paper's circulation has certainly been exaggerated in popular accounts of the event. It was not discovered to be a hoax for several weeks after its publication and, even then, the newspaper did not issue a retraction.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Doris V. "[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1972207.htm Thomas Low Nichols, Poe, and the 'Balloon Hoax'"] collected in ''Poe Studies'', vol. V, no. 2. December 1972. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel was initially amused by the hoax, noting that his own real observations could never be as exciting. He became annoyed later when he had to answer questions from people who believed the hoax was serious.

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] claimed the story was a plagiarism of his earlier work "[[The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall]]."  His editor at the time was Richard Adams Locke.  He later published "[[The Balloon-Hoax]]" in the same newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-great-moon-hoax-180-years-ago?linkId=16545579|title=The Great Moon Hoax – History in the Headlines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poe had published his own Moon hoax in late June 1835, two months before the similar Locke Moon hoax, in the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' entitled "Hans Phaall – A Tale," later republished as "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall." The story was reprinted in the ''[[New York Transcript]]'' on September 2–5, 1835, under the headline "Lunar Discoveries, Extraordinary Aerial Voyage by Baron Hans Pfaall." Poe described a voyage to the Moon in a hot-air balloon, in which Pfaall lives for five years on the Moon with lunarians and sends back a lunarian to earth. The Poe Moon hoax was less successful because of the satiric and comical tone of the account. Locke was able to upstage Poe and to steal his thunder. In 1846, Poe would write a biographical sketch of Locke as part of his series "The Literati of New York City" which appeared in ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]''.

The hoax, as well as Poe's "Hans Pfaall", are mentioned by characters in [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''.

Nate DiMeo's historical podcast ''[[The Memory Palace]]'' dedicated an episode to the Great Moon Hoax entitled "The Moon in the Sun."&lt;ref name="Episode 24: The Moon in the Sun"&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://thememorypalace.us/2010/01/episode-24-the-moon-in-the-sun/ |title=Episode 24: The Moon in the Sun |website=The Memory Palace |publisher=[[WordPress]] |host=DiMeo, Nate |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Hamzanama''''' ([[Persian Language|Persian]]/[[Urdu Language|Urdu]]: {{lang|fa|حمزه نامه}} ''Hamzenâme'', Epic of Hamza) or '''''Dastan-e-Amir Hamza''''' (Persian/Urdu: {{lang|fa|داستان امیر حمزه}} ''Dâstâne Amir Hamze'', Adventures of [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Amir Hamza]]) narrates the [[legend]]ary exploits of Amir Hamza, an uncle of [[Muhammad]], though most of the stories are extremely fanciful, "a continuous series of romantic interludes, threatening events, narrow escapes, and violent acts".&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the characters of the ''Hamzanama'' are fictitious. In the West the work is best known for the enormous illustrated manuscript commissioned by the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] in about 1562.

The ''Hamzanama'' contains 46 volumes and has approximately 48000 pages. It is said that Dastaan Ameer Hamza was written in the era of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]].

The text augmented the story, as traditionally told in dastan performances. The dastan (storytelling tradition) about Amir Hamza persists far and wide up to Bengal and Arakan (Burma), as the [[Mughals]] controlled those territories.&lt;ref&gt;see Asim Roy, 1983, ''The Islamic Syncretistic Tradition in Bengal'', Sterling: New Delhi, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–5; The Bustan of Amir Hamzah (the Malay version of Dastan-e-Amir Hamza);Farooque Ahmed, ''The Sangai Express''-Imphal, May 25, 2006 Amir Hamza-book review, ''muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/%3Fp%3D1824''&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the first Mughal Emperor, [[Babur]], described the ''Hamzanama'' as "one long far-fetched lie; opposed to sense and nature",&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 60&lt;/ref&gt; his grandson [[Akbar]], who came to the throne at the age of fourteen, greatly enjoyed it.  He commissioned his court workshop to create an illustrated manuscript of the ''Hamzanama'' early in his reign (he was by then about twenty), which was conceived on such an unusually large scale that it took fourteen years, from about 1562 to 1577, to complete.  Apart from the text, it included 1400 full page [[Mughal miniature]]s of an unusually large size, nearly all painted on paper, which were then glued to a cloth backing.  The work was bound in 14 volumes.  After the early pages, where various layouts were experimented with, one side of most folios has a painting, about 69&amp;nbsp;cm x 54&amp;nbsp;cm (approx. 27 x 20&amp;nbsp;inches) in size, done in a fusion of [[Persian miniature|Persian]] and Mughal styles. On the other side is the text in [[Persian language|Persian]] in [[Nasta'liq script]], arranged so that the text is opposite the matching picture in most openings of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the commission was completely unprecedented, and stretched even the huge imperial workshop.  According to contemporary accounts, about thirty main artists were used, and over a hundred men worked on the various aspects of the book in all.  According to Badauni and Shahnawaz Khan the work of preparing the illustrations was supervised initially by Mir Sayyid Ali and subsequently by Abdus Samad, the former possibly being replaced as head of the workshop because the pace of production was too slow.  After seven years only four volumes were completed, but the new head was able to galvanize production and complete the ten volumes in another seven years, without any loss of quality. Indeed, "the later pages are the most exciting and innovative in the work".&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Colophon (publishing)#Production notes|colophon]] of this manuscript is still missing. None of the folios of this manuscript so far found is signed, though many have been attributed to different artists.  Compared to Akbar's ''[[Tutinama]]'', a smaller commission begun and completed while the ''Hamzanama'' commission was in progress, the manuscript shows a much greater fusion of the styles of Indian and [[Persian miniature]]s.  Though the elegance and finish may seem closer to Persian works, the compositional style and narrative drama owe more to Indian tradition.  Between them, these two manuscripts are the key works in the formation of the [[Mughal miniature]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a little over a hundred of the paintings survive.  The largest group of 61 images is in the [[Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna]] (Österreichisches Museum für angewandte Kunst or MAK), with the rest spread over many collections. The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] possess 27 images, bought in [[Kashmir]], and the [[British Museum]] in London has one.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 189; [http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/h/hamzanama/ Titley says "only just over one hundred of the paintings have survived", while the V&amp;A says "about 140", but they are counting fragments.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/scene_from_hamzanama,_painting.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018145357/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/scene_from_hamzanama,_painting.aspx |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MAK organized in 2009 the exhibition ''GLOBAL:LAB, Art as a Message.

==Other versions==

The ''Dastan-e-Amir Hamza'' existed in several other illustrated manuscript versions. One version by Navab Mirza Aman Ali Khan Ghalib Lakhnavi was printed in 1855 and published by the Hakim Sahib Press, Calcutta, India. This version was later embellished by Abdullah Bilgrami and published by the Naval Kishore Press, Lucknow, in 1871.  Two English language translations have been published. The first is available in an expanded version on the website of the translator Frances Pritchett, of Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pritchett|first=Frances|title=The Romance Tradition in Urdu: The Adventures from Dastan-e Amir Hamza|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/hamzah/index.html|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pritchett's former student at Columbia University, Pasha Mohamad Khan, who currently teaches at McGill University, researches qissa/dastan (romances) and the art of dastan-goi (storytelling), including the ''Hamzanama''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/islamicstudies/people/tenure-stream-professors/pasha-m-khan|title=Pasha M. Khan {{!}} Institute of Islamic Studies - McGill University|website=www.mcgill.ca|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Musharraf Ali Farooqi]], a Pakistani-Canadian author, translated the Ghalib Lakhnavi/Abdulla Bilgriami version into English.

A Pakistani author [[Maqbool Jahangir]] wrote ''Dastan-e-Amir Hamza'' for children in 
Urdu language. His version contains 10 volumes and was published by [[Ferozsons]] (also Ferozsons Publishers).

The story is also performed in [[wayang|Indonesian puppet theatre]], where it is called ''Wayang Menak''.  Here, Hamzah is also known as Wong Agung Jayeng Rana or Amir Ambyah.

'''''Heroes for Hope: Starring the X-Men''''' is a 1985 [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] designed to raise awareness about hunger in Africa. Proceeds from the comic went to the [[American Friends Service Committee]], to assist in their work on behalf of  [[Africa]]n [[famine]] relief and recovery. Published in the form of a "[[comic jam]]," or [[exquisite corpse]], the book featured an [[all-star]] lineup of comics creators as well as a few notable authors from outside the comic book industry, such as [[Stephen King]], [[George R. R. Martin]], and [[Edward Bryant]]. It also saw a rare [[Alan Moore]] Marvel Comics credit outside his early [[Marvel UK]] work.

''Heroes for Hope'' featured some memorable artist/writer and penciler/inker pairings, including [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]]; [[Stephen King]] and [[Bernie Wrightson]]; Moore and [[Richard Corben]]; [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]]; [[Mike Baron]] and [[Steve Rude]], [[Howard Chaykin]] inked by [[Walt Simonson]]; and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] reuniting on the X-Men.

== Publication history ==
''Heroes for Hope'' came about in response to the devastating [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 223|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Horrified by the plight of starving children in Africa, writer/artist Jim Starlin and illustrator Bernie Wrightson convinced Marvel to publish ''Heroes For Hope''. It was a 'jam' book...and all of Marvel's profits were donated to famine relief in Africa.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was in the spirit of contemporaneous [[benefit concert|musical fund-raisers]] like [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", [[USA for Africa]]'s "[[We Are the World]]", and the [[Live Aid]] concerts. Then-Marvel Comics editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] described the genesis of the project this way:

{{quote|One night, a few months ago, artist [[Jim Starlin]] called me at home to propose an idea that his friend and fellow artist [[Berni Wrightson]] had suggested to him — that Marvel Comics publish a special issue of ''The X-Men'', a benefit book for famine relief in Africa. Jim and Berni wanted to do the book as a "jam," with as many artists and writers contributing, which would enable us to bring a small army of outstanding talents together on the project, making it a real event. I thought it was a great idea. The next morning I pitched it to Publisher [[Mike Hobson]] and President [[Jim Galton]]. . . . Jim and Berni recruited the artists. [[Chris Claremont]] . . . quickly volunteered to recruit writers, and to help . . . coordinate the entire project.&lt;ref name="afterword"&gt;Shooter, Jim. Afterword, ''Heroes for Hope: Starring the X-Men'' (Marvel Comics, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to the contributors donating their work for the project, so did logo designer [[Janet Jackson (comics)|Janet Jackson]] and Marvel's production staff; while [[Curtis Circulation Company]] and all the [[direct market]] distributors and [[comics specialty shop]]s donated their profits.&lt;ref name="afterword" /&gt;

== Plot ==
The comic book opens with [[Rachel Summers]] poking her head out of the [[X-Mansion]] to grab the mail, only to be confronted with a horrible sight. The X-Men rush to the entrance to see that the mansion has somehow been transported to the middle of a barren desert.

After retrieving the comatose mail carrier, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] senses that all is not right, and claws him in the face. But it turns out that it was all an illusion. The X-Men go back to business as usual after this fiasco, but then things begin to go wrong. One by one, a series of psychic assaults is launched on each member of the team, as they are subjected to their greatest subconscious fears.

First [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (with art by Byrne and Austin) is mocked by steely apparitions of his teammates. This is more than he can bear, and he curls up in a [[fetal position]]. [[Kitty Pryde]], as told by King, Wrightson, and inker [[Jeffrey Catherine Jones|Jeff Jones]], goes to grab something from the refrigerator only to be surprised by an evil Death-type being in a cloak. He exposes Kitty's great fear of going hungry. As told by [[Bill Mantlo]], [[Charles Vess]], and [[Jon J Muth]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] finds Kitty turned into a wizened old hag, which leads to his own experience, focusing on [[Christian]] imagery and moral dilemmas. Kurt is offered the chance to sacrifice himself so that one other person might breath the air and eat the food he would. He declines, and thinks himself a coward. Thanks to Moore and [[Richard Corben]], the next to fall prey to the spiritual onslaught is [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who is offered a glimpse of a world where his dream of mutant supremacy has been realized — and that it's not all it's cracked up to be. Rachel is swept back to her past, where she's confronted by a horde of mutant-hunting [[doppelgänger]] [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], reminding her of her part in that dystopian future. Wolverine, by Ellison, Miller, and inker Sienkiewicz, must confront the tension between his human and animal sides. Claremont, [[Brian Bolland]], and [[P. Craig Russell]] depict [[Ororo|Storm]] confronted by a carnival ringmaster, who traps her in a [[house of mirrors]]. She is shown various images of her possible self, each one more distorted than the last. Ororo gets drawn into the crazy carnival games, and in the first concrete expression of the story's theme, she realizes that it is wrong to waste food. Having defeated the psychic attacker by feeding illusory cream pies to illusory people, Storm returns to her teammates for discussion of what has transpired.

Courtesy of Rachel's powers, the X-Men track the psychic presence that's been harassing them to the continent of Africa. They fly the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] to the source, where they are met with horrible scenes of deprivation. Before long, a fleet of [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft arrive, full of supplies, which the X-Men help distribute.

That night, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] becomes so frustrated that she has not had her turn of psychic punishment yet that she decides to hunt down the entity herself. She sneaks around the campsite stealing her teammates' powers. Using the psychic powers of Rachel Summers, the Rogue hybrid traces the presence of the X-Men's harasser to a desert hideaway. Upon entering the crypt, Rogue is attacked by the avatar of the psychic being. Things are not going well for Rogue when Storm appears to give aid. The "entity" is revealed to be a primeval god-force that feeds on human despair. One by one, the X-Men awake from their Rogue-induced comas and join in the battle.

The X-Men finally defeat the entity and return to their campsite, where they resume the enormous task of feeding the starving refugees. They realize their battle with the entity was a metaphor for the fight against famine, and indeed any human struggle. Kitty expresses fear that the entity survived the battle and is ready to strike again, but Wolverine comforts her with words of hope.

'''Ibn al-Bawwāb''' was a Persian [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] and [[illuminated manuscripts|illuminator]] who lived during the time of the [[Buyid dynasty]]. He most likely died around 1022 AD in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/280693/Ibn-al-Bawwab|title=Ibn al-Bawwāb brief bio|accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ibn al-Bawwāb was from a poor family.  His name literally translates as the “son of the doorkeeper.”  He was trained in law and theology, was very devout and is said to have been able to recite the [[Quran|Qurʾān]] from memory.&lt;ref&gt;"Ibn al-Bawwab" [Biography], ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ibn-al-Bawwab Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied calligraphy with the daughter of [[Ibn Muqla]]. He was fluent in all six scripts and refined them. He achieved fame in his own lifetime and was readily recognised by his long beard. His students carried his improved style through to succeeding generations of calligraphers.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, G., ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World'',  Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, Ibn al-Bawwāb reputedly produced 64 copies of the Qurʾān. One of the most beautiful in the rayḥānī script is in the [[Laleli Mosque]] in Istanbul, and another is in the [[Chester Beatty Library]] in Dublin, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbl.ie/Collections/The-Islamic-Collection/The-Qur-an-Collection.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; a gift of the Ottoman Sultan [[Selim I]] (1470–1512). Ibn al-Bawwāb was recognized as a master in his own time; his school of calligraphy lasted until Baghdad fell to the [[Mongols]] more than two centuries after his death.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

==Works==
One of his greatest achievements was the perfection of the [[al-Khatt al-Mansub]] (literally, ''the well-proportioned script'') style of [[Islamic calligraphy]]. He also contributed to the development of many of the early cursive scripts including [[rayḥānī]], [[Naskh (script)|naskh]], [[Tawqi|tawqīʿ]] and [[muhaqqaq]].&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; Only one of Q'ran by al-Bawwab is known to have survived. It is the earliest extant manuscript written in cursive script on paper. &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, F (ed.), ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World'',  Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kate Bishop''' (1848 – 12 June 1923) was an English [[actress]] from [[Bristol]], a member of a theatrical family. Her brother and daughter were also successful actors. Her greatest success was in ''[[Our Boys]]'', which ran for more than four years in London. She temporarily retired from the theatre in the late nineteenth century, and returned to play character roles in the early years of the twentieth century.

==Biography==
Bishop was born into a theatrical family, the daughter of Charles Bishop. She began acting as a [[Child actor|child]] in [[Bristol]] in 1863.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''[[The Times]] obituary notice'', 13 June 1923, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Alfred also successfully entered the theatrical profession.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 May 1928, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
In 1868, Bishop appeared with [[Edward Askew Sothern]] in a revival of ''[[Our American Cousin]]'', in which ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' thought her "arch" but "lacking in dignity".&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 24 August 1868, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[West End theatre|West End]] she appeared in ''A Loving Cup'' at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 10 February 1869, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1871 at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in a succession of three new plays by [[W. S. Gilbert]], playing  Edith Temple in ''[[Randall's Thumb]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 January 1871, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Pipette in ''[[Creatures of Impulse]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 April 1871, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and Jessie Blake in ''On Guard''.  Of her performance in the last, ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "The notion of the irresistible flirt is completely realized by Miss Kate Bishop."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 November 1871, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop  played in ''About Town'' by Bertie Vyse in 1873&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 16 May 1873, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Ruy Blas Righted'' and ''Romulus and Remus'', both by [[Robert Reece]], in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 January 1874, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picturehistoryprints.com/product/id/19988 Picture History]. Retrieved 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Her most famous stage role was Violet Melrose in [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''[[Our Boys]]'', which she created in January 1875 and played practically continuously throughout its historic run of four years and four months.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; When ''Our Boys'' finally closed, it was by far the longest-running work of theatre up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Michael R. Review of plays by H. J. Byron including ''Our Boys'' in ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 82, No. 3, pp. 716-17 (July 1987; Modern Humanities Research Association)&lt;/ref&gt; Byron supplied a successor, ''The Girls'', in which Bishop had another leading role.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 April 1879, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Family life in Australia took her away from the English stage for some 15 years at the end of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; In 1900 she returned to the stage in ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', at the [[Garrick Theatre]], together with [[George Grossmith Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 December 1900, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; She played Mrs Percival de Hooley in [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''The Passing of the Third Floor Black'' in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 6 September 1908, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 she appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''Penelope'', by [[Somerset Maugham]], at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]]. Her last stage appearance was in 1915, as Lady Matilda Rye in [[Horace Annesley Vachell|H. A. Vachell's]] ''The Case of Lady Camber'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 13 June 1923, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1885, Bishop married Lewis J. Löhr, [[treasurer]] of the [[Melbourne]] [[Opera House]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Five years later their daughter [[Marie Lohr]], later a leading actress, was born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillan, Don.

Retrieved 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/marie-lohr-1 Answers.com] Retrieved 20 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop died in London, aged 75,&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

'''Literary fiction''' is a term used in the [[Publishing|book-trade]] to distinguish [[novel]]s that are regarded as having [[artistic merit|literary merit]] from most commercial or [[genre fiction|"genre" fiction]].  All the same, a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, [[John Banville]] publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both [[Doris Lessing]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] have written science fiction. Furthermore, Nobel laureate [[André Gide]] stated that [[Georges Simenon]], best known as the creator of the fictional detective [[Jules Maigret]], was "the most novelistic of novelists in French literature".&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Claffey, ''The Boston Globe September'',  10, 1989 Contributing to this report was Boston Globe book editor Mark Feeney.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Neal Stephenson]] has suggested that, while any definition will be simplistic, there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand, literary authors are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, Stephenson suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor ''Slashdot Interview'' from October 20, 2004 with Neal Stephenson]&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the distinction is becoming blurred with major writers of literary fiction, like Nobel laureate [[Doris Lessing]], as well as [[Margaret Atwood]], writing science fiction.  Doris Lessing described science fiction as "some of the best [[social fiction]] of our time", and called [[Greg Bear]], author of ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', "a great writer". &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dorislessing.org/boston.html Doris Lessing: Hot Dawns]'', interview by Harvey Blume in ''Boston Book Review''&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Georges Simenon]], the creator of the [[Maigret]] [[detective novel]]s, has been described by American composer and writer [[Ned Rorem]] as "one of the five greatest French writers of our century". Rorem placed Simenon in the company of [[Proust]], [[André Gide|Gide]], [[Cocteau]], and [[Sartre]]. 

In an interview, [[John Updike]] lamented that "the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit".{{sfn|Grossman|2006}} Likewise, on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', Updike argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because "they are written in words".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 ''The Charlie Rose Show'' from June 14, 2006 with John Updike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054558/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 |date=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Characteristics of literary fiction generally include one or more of the following:
*A concern with [[social commentary]], [[political criticism]], or reflection on the [[human condition]].{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}
*A focus on "introspective, in-depth character studies" of "interesting, complex and developed" characters,{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=7}} whose "inner stories" drive the plot, with detailed motivations to elicit "emotional involvement" in the reader.{{sfn|Coles|2007|p=26}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=8}}
*A slower pace than popular fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} As [[Terrence Rafferty]] notes, "literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way".{{sfn|Rafferty|2011}}
*A concern with the [[style (fiction)|style]] and complexity of the writing: Saricks describes literary fiction as "elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered".{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=179}}
*Unlike genre fiction plot is not the central concern.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=181-182}} 
*The [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}}

== Freak shows ==
Fraser has shown a continuing interest in freak shows.

His 2001 play 'Sealboy: Freak' draws on the life history of Stanislaus Berent, a sideshow performer with naturally occurring phocomelia who worked under the stage name [[Sealo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/932307/|title=B.F.I. Screenonline|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser's 2002 television documentary "Born Freak" looked at this historical tradition and its relevance to modern disabled performers.  This work has become the subject of academic analysis in the field of disability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/575/752|title=Disability Studies Quarterly|author1=Mitchell, David  |author2=Snyder, Sharon|date=Summer 2005|website=Volume 25, No. 3|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the documentary, Fraser performed in a Coney Island freak show.  He was invited to return to work there professionally and has since worked several summer seasons there.

Fraser's 2011 show, " From Freak to Clique", charted the history of portrayals of disability, including freak show performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatermania.com/chicago-theater/news/03-2011/mat-fraser-to-perform-from-freak-to-clique-at-vict_35532.html|title=Theatermania|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser was commissioned by the Research Centre for Museums and Galleries at the University of Leicester to create a new artistic work, shaped out of a collaborative engagement with museum collections, research and expertise in medical history, museums and disability.  The resulting  performance, "Cabinet of Curiosities: How disability was kept in a box" was performed at the Thackray Medical Museum, Leeds, the Silk Mill Museum, Derby and Manchester Museum.  It won the Observer Ethical Awards, Arts and Culture 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/museumstudies/rcmg/projects/cabinet-of-curiosities|title=University of Leicester|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guardian's Lyn Gardner stated that, "by making a spectacle of himself, Fraser is not only raising the spectre of the Victorian freak show but also subverting it by questioning what is exhibited and what isn't, and making us confront what we are shown and what we are not shown, both in art and in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2014/jan/22/disability-mat-fraser-museum-cabinet-curiosities-theatre|title=The Guardian|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=22 January 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mooghaun North Hoard''' or ''Great Clare Find'' is the name of an important Bronze Age hoard found at [[Mooghaun]] North, near Newmarket-on-Fergus in [[County Clare]], Ireland. Considered one of the greatest [[Bronze Age]] hoards of gold ever found north of the Alps, unfortunately most of the treasure was melted down soon after its discovery. What remains of the hoard is currently split between the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin and the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/info/objectsandtechniques.aspx National Museum of Ireland website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=5133&amp;plaA=5133-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; It is no. 11 in ''[[A History of Ireland in 100 Objects]]''.

==Discovery==
In March 1854, some workers building the [[West Clare Railway]] near [[Newmarket-on-Fergus]] were realigning a [[ditch|dyke]] near [[Mooghaun]] Lake, when they accidentally uncovered a huge cache of gold jewellery from the Bronze Age. While shifting a stone they brought to light a large cavity in the ground where the treasure was kept.  Most of the precious objects were sold to local dealers who melted them down for their [[bullion]] value and only 29 out of a total of over 150 objects survived. Most of the British Museum's share of the find was purchased from [[William Cole, 3rd Earl of Enniskillen|William Willoughby Cole]], 3rd Earl of Enniskillen in 1857.

==Description==
When discovered, the Mooghaun North Hoard was one of the largest Bronze Age treasures ever found in Northern or Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Arch"/&gt;{{rp|13}}  It consisted of over 150 gold objects including 138 bracelets, six collars, two [[torc]]s and several other items which in total weighed over 5&amp;nbsp;kg. Just 29 objects survived the melting pot - 15 in the [[National Museum of Ireland|National Museum]] and 14 in the [[British Museum]]. The extant items of jewellery from the hoard are mostly crescent-shaped bracelets (23) and six neck collars. Fortunately many pieces from the hoard were copied before they were destroyed. Archaeologists are unsure why the hoard was deposited in the stone chamber - it may have been for safe-keeping during a local crisis or was perhaps a [[votive offering]] to the gods.

Recent research indicates that much of the gold used in the creation of these pieces came from the [[Mourne Mountains]] in County Down.&lt;ref name="Arch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carthy|first=Hugh|title=Burren Archaeology|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848891050|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}

'''Muhanna Durra''' ({{lang-ar|مهنا دره}}), {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the Star of Jordan|OSJ]]}},  is a Jordanian painter widely regarded as a pioneer of the Jordanian Arts Movement and for being the first to introduce [[Cubism]] and [[abstract art]] into the Jordanian visual arts community. He is a professor at the Faculty of Fine Art and Design at [[University of Jordan]] and serves as the President of the [[Jordan Association of Fine Arts]].

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] in 1938 to a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] father and a Turkish mother,&lt;ref&gt;"Myhana Al Durra" in ''Guide to Jordanian Culture,'' Online: http://www.bourse-des-voyages.com/jordanie/guide-culture-peintres-muhanna-al-durra.php&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Dura was raised in a striking red hilltop villa in downtown Amman. The house is only a few blocks away from Amman's popular tourist attraction, the Roman amphitheater, and is commonly believed to rest atop an ancient Roman cemetery. As a child, spooky folklore about his neighborhood sparked a fascination with ghouls and "ignited fantasy in what was beyond the observable, physical world."&lt;ref name="colors"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuhur|first=Sherifa|title=Colors of enchantment: theater, dance, music and the visual arts of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOVPaLXjjsAC&amp;pg=PA377&amp;dq=Muhanna+Durra&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4h4cTbKaJM2r8AbgrfCOCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Muhanna%20Durra&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 December 2010|year=2001|publisher=American Univ. in Cairo Press|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A notoriously rebellious youth with a penchant for drawing, he was sent by his father to study art with George Allief (also known as ''[[George Aleef]]''), a former Russian officer with the Tsarist army. Allief taught him the basics of watercolor, drawing and painting, and the European understanding of perspective. These lessons with Allief marked the young artist's transition from childhood drawing to the disciplined work of a professional artist. According to Dura's memoirs, Allief taught his students to meticuoulsy render a matchbox as an exercise in perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the formative years with Allief, the young Muhanna met Dutch painter, William Hallowin, who introduced him to Rembrandt and the Dutch school which sparked an obsession with the power of light. In 1954, he was sent to the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma|Academy of Fine Arts in Rome]] to become the first Jordanian to receive a formal art education.&lt;ref&gt;"Muhanna Durra," in ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Vol. 2, Jonathan M. Bloom and Sheila S. Blair (eds), Oxford University Press, 2009, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to have been disillusioned by the academy and committed himself to studying the classics through art in museums and churches. After graduating in 1958, Durra returned to Amman to teach history of art at the Teachers' Training College. In 1964, Durra established the Fine Arts Section at the Department of Culture and Art, Amman, and then established the Jordan Institute of Fine Arts in 1970. &lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, pp 175-76&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1960 and 1970, Al-Durra returned to Rome, where he experimented with abstraction and cubism. In 1970, he returned to Jordan to receive the Kawkab Decoration from King Hussein. &lt;ref&gt;"Muhanna Al Durra," ''University of Jordan Newsletter,'' October, 2017, &lt;Online:http://ju.edu.jo/Lists/NewsLetter/Disp_form.aspx?ID=1418&amp;Issue=October%202017&amp;order=10&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Durra established an art studio; the first Jordanian to establish an art studio to teach local students.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; Among his notable students was the Princess [[Wijdan Ali]] who is best known for her attempts to revive the traditions of Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;Hashem Talham, G., ''Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013 p. 24; Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, pp 377-78 &lt;/ref&gt; Another student was Nawal Abdallah, who is one of the leading lights of Jordan's contemporary arts scene.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, M., "A Hit List of Jordanian Artists" in ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides, 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Durra is best known for his portraits and also for the way he treated shifting masses of colour.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, M., ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides, 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; He is also acknowledged as the first artist to introduce cubism and abstract art to the Jordanian arts community. &lt;ref&gt;"Muhanna Al Durra," ''University of Jordan Newsletter,'' October, 2017, &lt;Online:http://ju.edu.jo/Lists/NewsLetter/Disp_form.aspx?ID=1418&amp;Issue=October%202017&amp;order=10&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool.jpeg|thumb|300px|''Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool'', 1966, David Hockney]]
'''''Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool''''' is an [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]]-on-canvas painting by the British [[pop art]] artist [[David Hockney]], completed in 1966. It depicts the rear view of a naked man climbing out of a swimming pool outside a contemporary  house. It is held at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in Liverpool.  

==Background==
Hockney moved from England to California in 1964, drawn by its sleek modernist aesthetic and warm [[Mediterranean climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/david-hockney-pool-paintings|title=The pull of Hockney’s pool paintings - Apollo Magazine|date=4 February 2017|publisher=.apollo-magazine.com|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, while teaching at [[UCLA]], Hockney met the American art student [[Peter Schlesinger]].  The two became lovers, and Hockney started painting a series of pool pictures, often featuring Schlesinger. A few of these, such as ''Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool'' (1966), ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'' (1967) and ''[[Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)]]'' (1972), later achieved iconic status.  On 15 November 2018, the latter set a world record for the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction by a living artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/david-hockney-painting-sells-for-a-record-90-million.html|title=David Hockney painting sells for a record $90 million|first=Chloe|last=Taylor|date=16 November 2018|publisher=cnbc.com|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting measures {{cvt|152|x|152|cm|in}}. It depicts the communal pool of the apartment block at 1145 [[Larrabee Street]], Hollywood, north of [[Sunset Boulevard]], which was then the home of art dealer [[Nicholas Wilder]], and shows a naked Schlesinger, then 18 years old, climbing up and out of the pool.  Hockney, in his characteristic style, simplifies and flattens the image, and the rippling surface of the water is abstracted into wavy white lines on blue, similar to a comic or an advertisement.  The straight lines in the painting were created using [[masking tape]].  The work has a border of un-[[Primer (paint)|primed]] canvas, like a photograph, which Hockney says he left "to make the picture look more like a painting".  

The figure in the painting is based on a [[Instant camera|polaroid]] photograph Hockney took of Schlesinger standing up against the hood of his own [[MG Cars|MG car]]. Interviewed about the painting in 2012, Schlesinger laughed about it, saying "That’s why the part under the water isn't painted well—because it was just invented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/27/peter-schlesinger-david-hockney-s-muse-shows-new-works-in-l-a|title=Peter Schlesinger, David Hockney’s Muse, Shows New Works in L.A.|first=Isabel|last=Wilkinson|date=27 January 2012|publisher=thedailybeast.com|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967, Hockney's painting won the [[John Moores Painting Prize]] at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]].  The painting was acqiuired as a bequest from Sir [[John Moores (British businessman)|John Moores]] who in 1957 established the epomymous biannual award and subsequently often purchased the winning entry and then presented the work to the museum. Moores purchased this work in 1967 and presented it to the museum in 1968. The picture remains in the Walker's permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/hockney/pool.aspx|title='Peter Getting out of Nick's Pool', David Hockney - Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool museums|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rochas''' is a [[fashion design|fashion]], [[cosmetics|beauty]], and [[perfume]] house founded in 1925&lt;ref name="place"/&gt; by French designer Marcel Rochas (born 1902, died 1955) the first designer of 2/3-length coats and skirts with pockets.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;  
Rochas had been known primarily for its signature perfume, "[[Perfume#Famous perfumes classified by year of creation|Femme]]," which was packaged in a pink box with black [[lace]].&lt;ref name="place"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hirschberg|first=Lynn|title=Is There A Place for Olivier Theyskens?|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/magazine/06theyskens.html?ex=1312516800&amp;en=11147b14eed665ef&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss| date=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jackets"/&gt;  

The company found recent recognition for its [[fashion design]] when it chose [[Olivier Theyskens]] as its [[creative director]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="place"/&gt;  (In the years leading to his appointment, its clothes had not been considered notable.&lt;ref name="jackets"&gt;{{cite news | last =Hirschberg | first = Lynn| title =The Shape of Jackets to Come| publisher =New York Times | date =2003-11-30 | url =http://www.umsl.edu/~sauter/analysis/creativity/30THEYSKENS.html | accessdate = 2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Theyskens, within his first few months, created an "entirely new silhouette for the house" that was [[France|French]]-influenced and elegant.&lt;ref name="place"/&gt;  His first full collection, for Fall 2003, was praised by style.com as "ravishing" and "nothing short of magnificent."&lt;ref name="vogue fall 2003"&gt;{{cite web| last =Mower| first =Sarah | title =Rochas Runway Review (Fall 2003)| publisher =Style.com | date =2003-03-06| url =http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/F2003RTW/review/ROCHAS | accessdate = 2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next several years, Rochas continued to garner praise among fashion critics&lt;ref name="vogue spring 2004"&gt;{{cite web| last =Mower| first =Sarah | title =Rochas Runway Review (Spring 2004)| publisher =Style.com | date =2003-10-08| url =http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/S2004RTW/review/ROCHAS | accessdate = 2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vogue fall 2004"&gt;{{cite web| last =Mower| first =Sarah | title =Rochas Runway Review (Fall 2004)| publisher =Style.com | date =2004-03-03| url =http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/F2004RTW/review/ROCHAS | accessdate = 2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vogue spring 2005"&gt;{{cite web| last =Mower| first =Sarah | title =Rochas Runway Review (Spring 2005)| publisher =Style.com | date =2004-10-10| url =http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/S2005RTW/review/ROCHAS | accessdate = 2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vogue fall 2005"&gt;{{cite web| last =Mower| first =Sarah | title =Rochas Runway Review (Fall 2005)| publisher =Style.com | date =2005-03-02| url =http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/F2005RTW/review/ROCHAS | accessdate = 2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vogue spring 2006"&gt;{{cite web| last =Mower| first =Sarah | title =Rochas Runway Review (Spring 2006)| publisher =Style.com | date =2005-10-05| url =http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/S2006RTW/review/ROCHAS | accessdate = 2007-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to attract loyal followers.  Rochas' clients included [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Kate Bosworth]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Rachel Weisz]], and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; In 2006, the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]] awarded Theyskens the International Award.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; However, Theyskens' focus on "[[demicouture]]" (special pieces too costly to mass-produce but which may not meet strict [[haute couture|couture]] rules regarding hand-stitching and numbers of fitting) was questioned by fashion insiders as a viable business strategy.&lt;ref name="place"/&gt;  His gowns, some of which were priced upwards of $20,000, were often out of reach for all but the most fabulously wealthy.&lt;ref name="place"/&gt; Theyskens took a purer approach to fashion and did not rely (like many fashion houses) on accessory sales and cheaper sister lines for a steady stream of revenue.&lt;ref name="place"/&gt;

In July 2006, Procter &amp; Gamble announced the discontinuation of Rochas' fashion division, shocking many in the fashion industry.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title =House of Rochas suddenly out of fashion| publisher =[[Daily Telegraph]] | date =2006-07-19 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2006/07/19/efrochas19.xml | accessdate = 2007-03-12 | location=London | first=Hilary | last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One "longtime designer," commenting anonymously in the New York Times, said of the closure, "That sort of perfect, made-to-measure business can't exist today, which is really too bad. Everything is about business now, and fashion shouldn't have to follow normal economic models&amp;mdash;that's not the point. What happened to investing in beauty?"&lt;ref name="place"/&gt;

News emerged in 2008 that there were plans to reopen the fashion house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122334740444310553?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=P&amp;G Pact to Reopen Rochas Fashion House | first=Ellen | last=Byron | date=2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2008, Marco Zanini was named new artistic director for the fashion house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/fashion/designers-of-desire-marco-zanini-at-rochas.html|title=Designers of Desire: Marco Zanini at Rochas|last=Seidler|first=Benjamin|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed his first collection during Paris Fashion Week in February 2009.

About half a century separate Marco Zanini from the creator and founder of the house, Marcel Rochas. Born in 1971, Marco Zanini graduated from the Fine Arts Academy of Milan in 1995. After having been Assistant at [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] for their ready-to-wear line, he became [[Donatella Versace]]'s right arm. He then relaunched the American brand of [[Halston]]. Rochas conferred the responsibility of its ready-to-wear collections upon him in 2009. His ambition to build "brick by brick" and season after season the foundations of a renewed House of Rochas, his insistence on making each new collection "unpredictable", confirm the renaissance of Rochas in fashion.

In September 2013, it was confirmed that Zanini would be leaving Rochas after five years with the brand to take on the role of Creative Director at the [[Elsa Schiaparelli| House of Schiaparelli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG10343784/Marco-Zanini-appointed-Schiaparelli-creative-director.html Marco Zanini appointed Schiaparelli creative director], ''Telegraph Fashion'', September 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He would be replaced by [[Alessandro Dell'Acqua]] who currently also designs his own line [[No. 21]]. Dell'Acqua's first show for Rochas is set to take place in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2013/09/26/alessandro-dell-acqua-replaces-marco-zanini-at-rochas Dell'Acqua Replaces Zanini At Rochas],''Vogue UK'', September 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Rochas has made their first foray into menswear. In January the formerly only women's wear oriented label unveiled their first menswear collection, created by French designer Béatrice Ferran. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.fashionnetwork.com/news/Paris-Fashion-Week-Rochas-unveils-sophisticated-menswear-collection,783506.html#.WV9FU4SGO70|title=Paris Fashion Week: Rochas unveils sophisticated menswear collection|last=Muret|first=FashionNetwork.com, Dominique|work=FashionNetwork.com|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''screenplay writer''' (also called '''screenwriter''' for short), '''scriptwriter''' or '''scenarist''', is a writer who practices the craft of [[screenwriting]], writing [[screenplay]]s on which [[mass media]], such as [[film]]s, [[television program]]s and [[video games]], are based.

==Profession==
Screenwriting is a [[freelance]] profession. No education is required to become a professional screenwriter, just good [[storytelling]] abilities and [[imagination]]. Screenwriters are not hired employees but contracted freelancers. Most, if not all, screenwriters start their careers writing on speculation (spec) and so write without being hired or paid for it. If such a script is sold, it is called a [[spec script]]. What separates a [[professional]] screenwriter from an [[amateur]] screenwriter is that professional screenwriters are usually represented by a [[talent agent|talent agency]]. Also, professional screenwriters do not often work for free, but amateur screenwriters will often work for free and are considered "writers in training." Spec scripts are usually penned by unknown professional screenwriters and amateur screenwriters.

There are a legion of would-be screenwriters who attempt to enter the [[film industry]], but it often takes years of trial-and-error, failure, and gritty persistence to achieve success. In ''Writing Screenplays that Sell'', Michael Hague writes, "Screenplays have become, for the last half of [the twentieth] century, what the [[Great American Novel]] was for the first half. Closet writers who used to dream of the glory of getting into print now dream of seeing their story on the big or small screen."&lt;ref name=Hauge&gt;{{cite book|last=Hauge|first=Michael|title=Writing Screenplays That Sell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film industry==
Every screenplay and teleplay begins with a thought or idea, and screenwriters use their ideas to write scripts, with the intention of selling them and having them produced.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Brooks|title=Creativity and integrity: Marketing the "in development" screenplay|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=17 April 2009|volume=26|issue=5|pages=421–444|doi=10.1002/mar.20281}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the script is based on an existing property, such as a book or person's life story, which is adapted by the screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenwriterdude.com/biopic---book-adaptation.html Biopic &amp; Book Adaptation - http://www.screenwriterdude.com/biopic---book-adaptation.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the time, a film project gets initiated by a screenwriter. The initiator of the project gets the exclusive writing assignment.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"/&gt; They are referred to as "exclusive" assignments or "pitched" assignments. Screenwriters who often pitch new projects, whether original or an adaptation, often do not have to worry about competing for assignments and are often more successful. When word is put out about a project a [[film studio]], [[production company]], or producer wants done, they are referred to as "open" assignments. Open assignments are more competitive. If screenwriters are competing for an open assignment, more-established writers usually win the assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and personally offered a writing assignment.

==Script doctoring==
Many screenwriters also work as full or part-time [[script doctor]]s, attempting to better a script to suit the desires of a [[film director|director]] or [[movie studio|studio]]. For instance, studio management may have a complaint that the motivations of the characters are unclear or that the dialogue is weak.

Script-doctoring can be quite lucrative, especially for the better-known writers. [[David Mamet]] and [[John Sayles]], for instance, fund the movies that they direct themselves, usually from their own screenplays, by writing and doctoring scripts for others. In fact, some writers make very profitable careers out of being the ninth or tenth writer to work on a piece, and they often work on projects that never see exposure to an audience of any size. Many up-and-coming screenwriters also [[ghostwrite]] projects and allow more-established screenwriters to take public credit for the project to increase the chances of it getting picked up.

==Development process==
After a screenwriter finishes a project, he or she pairs with an industry-based representative, such as a [[film producer|producer]], director, [[literary agent]], entertainment lawyer, or entertainment executive. The partnerships often pitch their project to investors or others in a position to further a project. Once the script is sold, the writer has only the rights that were agreed with the purchaser.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"/&gt;

A screenwriter becomes credible by having work that is recognized, which gives the writer the opportunity to earn a higher income.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"/&gt; As more films are produced independently (outside the studio system), many up-and-coming screenwriters are turning to pitch fests, screenplay contests, and independent development services to gain access to established and credible independent producers. Many development executives are now working independently to incubate their own pet projects.

==Production involvement==
Screenwriters are rarely involved in the development of a film. Sometimes they come on as advisors, or if they are established,  as a producer. Some screenwriters also direct. Although many scripts are sold each year, many do not make it into production because the number of scripts that are purchased every year exceeds the number of professional directors that are working in the film and [[TV industry]]. When a screenwriter finishes a project and sells it to a [[film studio]], [[production company]], TV network, or producer, he or she often has to continue networking, mainly with directors or executives, and push to have their projects "chosen" and turned into films or TV shows. If interest in a script begins to fade, a project can go dead.

==Union==
Most professional screenwriters in the U.S. are [[unionized]] and are represented by the [[Writers Guild of America]]. Although membership in the WGA is recommended, it is not required of a screenwriter to join. The WGA is the final arbiter on awarding [[WGA screenwriting credit system|writing credit]] for projects under its jurisdiction.  The WGA also looks upon and verifies film copyright materials.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Service mark.svg|thumb|250px|A [[fiction]]al [[logo]] using the [[service mark symbol]].]]

A '''service mark''' or '''servicemark''' is a [[trademark]] used in the [[United States]] and several other countries to identify a [[Service (economics)|service]] rather than a [[product (business)|product]].&lt;ref&gt;For the U.S. definition, see {{cite web|title=15 U.S. Code § 1127. Construction and definitions; intent of chapter|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1127|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Trademark Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/intellectual_property/trademark_law.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a service mark is federally registered, the standard registration symbol [[registered trademark symbol|&amp;reg;]] or "Reg U.S. Pat &amp; TM Off" may be used (the same symbol is used to mark registered trademarks).  Before it is registered, it is common practice (with some legal standing) to use the [[service mark symbol]] &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;℠&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; (a [[superscript]] SM).

The service mark symbol is mapped in [[Unicode]] as {{unichar|2120|Service mark}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2100.pdf
|title=The Unicode Standard 7.0, Letterlike Symbols
|publisher=Unicode, Inc.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Unicode-capable browser is needed to display this character properly, which appears similar to "&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;". The HTML entity is &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8480;&lt;/code&gt;.

== Usage ==
A service mark differs from a trademark in that the mark is used on the advertising of the service rather than on the packaging or delivery of the service, since there is generally no "package" to place the mark on, which is the practice for trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Lawrence E.|title=Primer on Trademarks and Service Marks|journal=St. Mary's Law Journal|date=1986|volume=18|page=138|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/stmlj18&amp;div=13&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[private carrier]] can paint its service mark on its vehicles, such as on planes or buses. Personal service providers can place their service marks on their delivery vehicles, such as on the trucks of [[plumbers]] or on [[moving van]]s.  However, if the service deals with communications, it is possible to use a service mark consisting of a sound (a [[sound trademark]]) in the process of delivering the service.  This has been done in the case of [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]], which uses a tone sound followed by a woman speaking the company's name to identify its long distance service; [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], which uses the sound of a [[lion]]'s roar; and [[RKO Pictures]], which used a [[Morse code]] signal for their motion pictures.

Under United States law, service marks have a different standard of use in order to count as a use in commerce, which is necessary to complete registration and to stop infringement by competitors. A trademark normally needs to be used on or directly in association with the sale of goods, such as on a store display. As services are not defined by a concrete product, use of a service mark on the uniforms or vehicles of service providers or in [[advertisement]]s is instead accepted as a use in commerce. However, like trademarks, service marks must pass a test of distinctiveness for it to be qualified as a service mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard|first1=Donna L.|title=Trademarks and Service Marks and Internet Domain Names: Giving ICANN Deference|journal=Arizona State Law Journal|date=2001|volume=33|page=637|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/arzjl33&amp;div=23&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Dollar-Thrifty Automotive Group|Thrifty, Inc.]] attempted to submit a service mark application that described aspects of their business (uniforms, buildings, certain vehicles) as "being blue." The application was rejected for not being specific enough, and the rejection was upheld on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In re Thrifty, Inc., 274 F.3d 1349, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2001)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15159379864415021322|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Stanley Carr Boulter''' (29 May 1852 – 5 January 1917) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] lawyer and businessman, who established The [[Law Debenture Corporation]].  In 1902, he married [[Helen Carte]], widow of [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], and he assisted in the financing of the [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]] hotel group.

==Education and career==
Boulter was educated at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] before being [[called to the Bar]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BLTR873SC|name=Boulter, Stanley Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Obituary: p. 152, ''The Annual Register: a review of public events at home and abroad, for the year 1917''. London: Longmans, Green and Co. 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 28 January 1879, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; During his legal career, he was at one point editor of the Law Reports in ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  As a barrister he concentrated on commercial and financial civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 10 March 1883, p. 6; 18 April 1883, p. 6; 30 April 1883, p. 3; and 4 July 1883, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Such criminal cases as he took were generally concerned with fraud and breaches of bankruptcy laws.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., ''The Times'', 16 May 1884, p. 33; and 30 October 1885, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1885 onwards he was sufficiently eminent to appear before the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 May 1885, p. 5; and 8 July 1885, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Boulter turned his energies to finance.  He was one of the founders of the [[Law Debenture Corporation]], of which he remained the chairman until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesharegallery.co.uk/1939_Law_Debenture.htm The Share Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also chairman of the Imperial Colonial Finance and Agency Corporation, and the New Investment Company.&lt;ref name=tt&gt;''The Times'', 9 January 1917, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Times]]'' called him "one of the leading representatives of the great [[Trust company|Trust Companies]]....  Nobody was better than Mr. Boulter at handling a difficult meeting of shareholders ... and restoring confidence."&lt;ref name=tt/&gt;

In politics, Boulter began as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], but disagreed with his party leader, [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E. Gladstone]], over [[Irish Home Rule bills|Irish home rule]]. Boulter stood unsuccessfully as a "[[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]]" in the general election of 1886,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 July 1886, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and his political views came to be aligned with those of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] party, particularly on any matters affecting the integrity of the [[British empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulter, Stanley.  "Liberal Votes and the Boers", ''The Times'', 18 October 1900&lt;/ref&gt; In social politics he remained more liberal, advocating public assistance for working men to buy homes.&lt;ref&gt;"Municipal aided purchase of artisans' dwellings", ''[[The Observer]]'', 31 July 1894, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his later years, he was a [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Family==
The son of John Boulter of [[Frimley]], Surrey, Boulter first married Edith ''née'' Anderson. There were three sons and four daughters of the marriage.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U193749 " Boulter, Stanley Carr"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 18 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Edith died in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 September 1896, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1902, he married [[Helen Carte]].  Her first husband, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], had built and operated both the [[Savoy Theatre]] and [[Savoy Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 May 1902, p. 1. The wedding took place on 25 April 1902 at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]].&lt;/ref&gt; Boulter used the Law Debenture Corporation to assist in raising funds for expansion of the hotel and was appointed vice-chairman of the Savoy hotel group.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Stanley Boulter", obituary, ''The Times'', 8 January 1917, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  After his wife's death in 1913, he continued as vice-chairman and assisted the new chairman, her stepson [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], with matters related to the D'Oyly Carte businesses.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 November 1915, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Boulter died in London in 1917 at the age of 64.

'''''The First Grader''''' is a 2010 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Justin Chadwick]]. It stars [[Naomie Harris]], [[Oliver Litondo]], and [[Tony Kgoroge]]. The film is based on the true story of [[Kimani Maruge]], a [[Kenya]]n farmer who enrolled in elementary school at the age of 84 following the Kenyan government's announcement of free universal primary education in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/movies/the-first-grader-justin-chadwicks-tale-of-kenyan-culture-review.html?ref=movies&amp;_r=0 | title = Simple Quest for Literacy Hits a Wall of Politics | work = A.O. Scott | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2015-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Plot==
In 2003, a disc jockey announces over a Kenyan radio station that the government is offering free primary school education to all natives who can prove citizenship with a birth certificate. Kimani Maruge (Litondo), an 84-year-old villager, hears this and decides to take it upon himself to seek an education. Arriving at his local school, he meets Jane Obinchu (Harris), the principal and teacher. He expresses his desire to learn how to read. Her teaching colleague Alfred (Munyua), ridicules him and demands he leave. Later, Jane informs her husband Charles (Kgoroge) about Maruge. He discourages her in supporting his educational endeavor. 

After beginning his initial classes, Maruge is plagued by memories of his service during the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] against the British in the 1950s. He begins to hallucinate and becomes confrontational with the students, struggling to continue his academics. Controversy begins to stir over Maruge’s education. Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility.

Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Maruge’s case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. Following negative feedback and random acts of violence against the school, Jane soon receives a letter that she is to be transferred to another educational institute a few hundred miles away.

Jane reveals to Maruge that she is relocating, and then commences an emotional goodbye with the children. Following protests and disobedience on part of the students towards their new teacher, Maruge is motivated to travel to Nairobi to appeal himself to the education board. Jane is reinstated at the school, where Maruge and the children are there to welcome her. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that at age 84, Maruge is the oldest person to start primary school according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Supplementally, he was invited to make a speech before international leaders at the [[United Nations|UN]] in New York regarding the power of education. He inspired a whole new generation of people to go to school for the first time. Maruge later died in 2009.

===Filming===
[[File:Africa6 006.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]] in Kenya, where filming took place.]]
US based film producer [[Sam Feuer]] found the story on the front page of the LA Times and optioned the rights. He, and then, producing partner Richard Harding, partnered with BBC Films and hired Ann Peacock to write the screenplay. The British produced film was shot on location in the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Rift Valley]] in Kenya, despite earlier reports that it would be filmed in [[South Africa]]. Director Chadwick conveyed, "We could have shot it in South Africa, but Kenya has this unbelievable, inexplicable energy inherent in the children, and the people we were making the film about".&lt;ref&gt;Interview with director Justin Chadwick, reproduced by Soda Pictures.

In [[comedy]], a '''throwaway line''' (also: '''throwaway joke''' or '''throwaway gag''') is a [[joke]] delivered "in passing" without being the [[punch line]] to a [[comedy routine]], part of the [[wikt:buildup|build up]] to another joke, or (in the context of [[drama]]) there to advance a story or develop a character. Throwaway lines are often [[one-liner joke|one-liner]]s, or [[in-joke]]s, and often delivered in a [[deadpan]] manner.

In [[comic strip]]s ([[Sunday comics]] in particular) throwaway gags are often placed in the throwaway panels of the comic, and are located there so that removing the throwaway panels for space reasons will not destroy the narrative of the central comic.

In [[episodic fiction]], a line intended originally as a throwaway line in one episode may later be [[retconned]] by being incorporated into the [[back-story]] of the main drama, and used to develop the longer-term plot.

'''UbuWeb''' is a large web-based educational resource for [[avant-garde]] material available on the internet, founded in 1996 by poet [[Kenneth Goldsmith]]. It offers [[visual poetry|visual]], [[Concrete poetry|concrete]] and [[sound poetry]], expanding to include [[film]] and [[sound art]] [[mp3]] archives.

==Philosophy==

UbuWeb was founded in response to the marginal distribution of crucial [[avant-garde]] material. It remains [[non-commercial]] and operates on a [[gift economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith, [http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/goldsmith/ubuweb.html "Ubuweb Wants to be Free" Open Letter], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; UbuWeb ensures educational open access to out-of-print works that find a second life through [[digital art]] reprint while also representing the work of contemporaries. It addresses problems in the distribution of and access to intellectual materials.

==Distribution policy==

UbuWeb does not distribute commercially viable works but rather resurrects [[avant-garde]] [[sound art]], [[video]] and textual works through their translation into a [[digital art]] web environment - re-contextualising them with current academic commentary and contemporary practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Damon Krukowski]], "[http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/goldsmith/artforum.html Free Verses: Kenneth Goldsmith and UbuWeb]", ''[[Artforum]]'', March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It houses and distributes freely the entire archive of the [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] project.

==Content==

Beyond its repository of works, UbuWeb features curated sections including [http://www.ubu.com/ubu/ ''/ubu Editions''] book-length editions of contemporary [[poetry]], selected and introduced by the poet Brian Kim Stefans. [http://www.ubu.com/ethno/ ''UbuWeb: Ethnopoetics''], curated by [[Jerome Rothenberg]], is fusing the avant-garde with traditional ethnic practices. [http://www.ubu.com/papers/ ''UbuWeb: Papers''] a series of contextual academic essays. [http://www.ubu.com/outsiders/ ''UbuWeb:Outsiders''] considers the legitimization of Outsider works and features [http://www.ubu.com/outsiders/365/index.html ''The 365 Days Project''] curated by Otis Fodder.

==Infrastructure==

UbuWeb is not affiliated to any academic institution, instead relying on alliances of interest and benefiting from bandwidth donations from its partnerships with [https://web.archive.org/web/20060715105639/http://greylodge.org/gpc/ GreyLodge], [[WFMU]], PennSound, The Electronic Poetry Center, The Center for Literary Computing, and ArtMob.

UbuWeb's board of directors includes the poets [[Charles Bernstein]], [[Darren Wershler-Henry]] and critic [[Marjorie Perloff]].

{{nihongo|'''Ukiyo-e'''{{efn|The obsolete transliteration ''ukiyo-ye'' appears in older texts.}}|浮世絵||{{IPA-ja|ɯkʲijoꜜe|pron}}; literally "picture[s] of the [[ukiyo|Floating World]]"|lead=yes}} is a genre of [[Japanese art]] which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries.  Its artists produced [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] and [[Nikuhitsu-ga|paintings]] of such subjects as female beauties; [[kabuki]] actors and [[sumo]] wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; [[Flora of Japan|flora]] and [[Wildlife of Japan#Fauna|fauna]]; and [[erotica]].

[[Edo]] (modern Tokyo) became the seat of government for the [[Shōgun|military dictatorship]] in the early 17th century.  The merchant class at the bottom of [[Four occupations|the social order]] benefited most from the city's rapid economic growth.  Many indulged in the entertainments of kabuki theatre, [[oiran|courtesans]], and [[geisha]] of the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  The term ''[[ukiyo]]'' ("floating world") came to describe this hedonistic lifestyle.  Printed or painted ''ukiyo-e'' images of this environment emerged in the late 17th century and were popular with the merchant class, who had become wealthy enough to afford to decorate their homes with them.

The earliest success was in the 1670s with [[Hishikawa Moronobu|Moronobu]]'s paintings and monochromatic prints of beautiful women.  [[Colour printing|Colour in prints]] came gradually—at first added by hand for special commissions.  By the 1740s, artists such as [[Okumura Masanobu|Masanobu]] used multiple woodblocks to print areas of colour.  From the 1760s the success of [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]]'s [[nishiki-e|"brocade prints"]] led to full-colour production becoming standard, each print made with numerous blocks.  Specialists have prized the portraits of beauties and actors by masters such as [[Torii Kiyonaga|Kiyonaga]], [[Utamaro]], and [[Sharaku]] that came in the late 18th century.  In the 19th century followed a pair of masters best remembered for their landscapes: the bold formalist [[Hokusai]], whose ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa|Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' is one of the best-known works of Japanese art; and the serene, atmospheric [[Hiroshige]], most noted for his series ''[[The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō]]''.  Following the deaths of these two masters, and against the technological and social modernization that followed the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, ukiyo-e production went into steep decline.

Some ukiyo-e artists specialized in making paintings, but most works were prints.  Artists rarely carved their own woodblocks for printing; rather, production was divided between the artist, who designed the prints; the carver, who cut the woodblocks; the printer, who inked and pressed the woodblocks onto [[Washi|hand-made paper]]; and the publisher, who financed, promoted, and distributed the works.  As printing was done by hand, printers were able to achieve effects impractical with machines, such as the [[Bokashi (printing)|blending or gradation of colours]] on the printing block.

Ukiyo-e was central to forming the West's perception of [[Japanese art]] in the late 19th century–especially the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige.  From the 1870s [[Japonism]] became a prominent trend and had a strong influence on the early [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] such as [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and [[Claude Monet|Monet]], as well as [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]] such as [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]] and [[Art Nouveau]] artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]].  The 20th century saw a revival in Japanese printmaking: the ''[[shin-hanga]]'' ("new prints") genre capitalized on Western interest in prints of traditional Japanese scenes, and the ''[[sōsaku-hanga]]'' ("creative prints") movement promoted individualist works designed, carved, and printed by a single artist.  Prints since the late 20th century have continued in an individualist vein, often made with techniques imported from the West.

==History==

===Pre-history===

Japanese art since the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) had followed two principal paths: the nativist ''{{transl|ja|[[Yamato-e]]}}'' tradition, focusing on Japanese themes, best known by the works of the [[Tosa school]]; and Chinese-inspired ''{{transl|ja|kara-e}}'' in a variety of styles, such as the monochromatic [[ink wash painting]] of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] and his disciples.  The [[Kanō school]] of painting incorporated features of both.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=8–9}}

Since antiquity, Japanese art had found patrons in the aristocracy, military governments, and religious authorities.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=66}}  Until the 16th century, the lives of the common people had not been a main subject of painting, and even when they were included, the works were luxury items made for the ruling samurai and rich merchant classes.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=66–67}}  Later works appeared by and for townspeople, including inexpensive monochromatic paintings of female beauties and scenes of the theatre and [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  The hand-produced nature of these ''{{transl|ja|shikomi-e}}''{{efn|{{lang|ja|仕込絵}} ''{{transl|ja|shikomi-e}}''}} limited the scale of their production, a limit that was soon overcome by genres that turned to mass-produced [[woodblock printing]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=67–68}}

[[File:Kano Hideyori - Maple Viewers - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|alt=A painted screen of six panels depicting a park-like setting in which visitors enjoy the scenery|''Maple Viewing at Takao'' (mid-16th century) by [[Kanō Hideyori]] is one of the earliest Japanese paintings to feature the lives of the common people.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=66}}]]

During a [[Sengoku period|prolonged period of civil war]] in the 16th century, a class of politically powerful merchants had developed.  These {{illm|Machishū|ja|町衆|lt=''{{transl|ja|machishū}}''}}{{efn|{{nihongo||町衆|{{illm|machishū|ja|町衆}} }} }} allied themselves with the court and had power over local communities; their patronage of the arts encouraged a revival in the classical arts in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.{{sfn|Kita|1984|pp=252–253}}  In the early 17th century [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] (1543–1616) unified the country and was appointed ''[[shōgun]]'' with supreme power over Japan.  He consolidated [[Tokugawa shogunate|his government]] in the village of [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo),{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}} and required the [[Daimyō|territorial lords]] to [[Sankin-kōtai|assemble there in alternate years]] with their entourages.  The demands of the growing capital drew many male labourers from the country, so that males came to make up nearly seventy percent of the population.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=17}}  The village grew during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867) from a population of 1800 to over a million in the 19th century.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}}

The centralized shogunate put an end to the power of the ''{{transl|ja|machishū}}'' and divided the population into [[Four occupations|four social classes]], with the ruling [[samurai]] class at the top and the merchant class at the bottom.  While deprived of their political influence,{{sfn|Kita|1984|pp=252–253}} those of the merchant class most benefited from the rapidly expanding economy of the Edo period,{{sfn|Singer|1986|p=66}} and their improved lot allowed for leisure that many sought in the pleasure districts—in particular [[Yoshiwara]] in Edo{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=4–5}}—and collecting artworks to decorate their homes, which in earlier times had been well beyond their financial means.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=6}}  The experience of the pleasure quarters was open to those of sufficient wealth, manners, and education.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=137}}

[[File:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|alt=Painting of a mediaeval Asian man seated and dressed in splendour|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] established his government in the early 17th century in Edo (modern Tokyo).&lt;br/&gt;''Portrait of Tokugawa Ieyasu'', [[Kanō school]] painting, [[Kanō Tan'yū]], 17th century]]

[[Woodblock printing in Japan]] traces back to the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' in 770&amp;nbsp;CE.  Until the 17th century such printing was reserved for Buddhist seals and images.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=68}}  [[Movable type]] appeared around 1600, but as the [[Japanese writing system]] required about 100,000 type pieces,&lt;!-- this doesn't mean 100,000 characters in the writing system---it means that certain characters were used multiple times on the same page, and therefore multiples of the characters had to be available to the printer --&gt; hand-carving text onto woodblocks was more efficient.  In [[Saga Domain]], calligrapher [[Honami Kōetsu]] and publisher {{Interlanguage link multi|Suminokura Soan|ja|3=角倉素庵}} combined printed text and images in an adaptation of ''[[The Tales of Ise]]'' (1608) and other works of literature.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}  During the [[Kan'ei]] era (1624–1643) illustrated books of folk tales called ''{{transl|ja|tanrokubon}}'', or "orange-green books", were the first books mass-produced using woodblock printing.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=68}}  Woodblock imagery continued to evolve as illustrations to the ''{{transl|ja|[[kanazōshi]]}}'' genre of tales of hedonistic urban life in the new capital.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=69}}  The rebuilding of Edo following the [[Great Fire of Meireki]] in 1657 occasioned a modernization of the city, and the publication of illustrated printed books flourished in the rapidly urbanizing environment.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=69–70}}

The term "ukiyo",{{efn|{{nihongo||浮世|ukiyo}} "floating world"}} which can be translated as "floating world", was [[Homophone|homophonous]] with an ancient Buddhist term signifying "this world of sorrow and grief".{{efn|{{nihongo||憂き世|ukiyo}} "world of sorrow"}}  The newer term at times was used to mean "erotic" or "stylish", among other meanings, and came to describe the hedonistic spirit of the time for the lower classes.  [[Asai Ryōi]] celebrated this spirit in the novel ''Ukiyo Monogatari'' ("''Tales of the Floating World''", {{circa|1661}}):{{sfn|Hickman|1978|pp=5–6}}

{{quote
|text = "living only for the moment, savouring the moon, the snow, the cherry blossoms, and the maple leaves, singing songs, drinking sake, and diverting oneself just in floating, unconcerned by the prospect of imminent poverty, buoyant and carefree, like a gourd carried along with the river current: this is what we call ''ukiyo''."}}

===Emergence of ukiyo-e (late 17th&amp;nbsp;– early 18th centuries)===

The earliest ukiyo-e artists came from the world of [[Japanese painting]].{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  Yamato-e painting of the 17th century had developed a style of outlined forms which allowed inks to be dripped on a wet surface and spread out towards the outlines—this outlining of forms was to become the dominant style of ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=155}}

[[File:Hikone Screen.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|alt=A folding screen painted with Japanese figures at play against a gold background|The [[Hikone screen]] may be the oldest surviving ukiyo-e work, dating to {{circa|1624–44}}.]]

Around 1661, painted [[Kakemono|hanging scrolls]] known as ''Portraits of Kanbun Beauties'' gained popularity.  The paintings of the [[Kanbun (era)|Kanbun era]] (1661–73), most of which are anonymous, marked the beginnings of ukiyo-e as an independent school.{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  The paintings of [[Iwasa Matabei]] (1578–1650) have a great affinity with ukiyo-e paintings.  Scholars disagree whether Matabei's work itself is ukiyo-e;{{sfn|Kita|1999|p=39}} assertions that he was the genre's founder are especially common amongst Japanese researchers.{{sfn|Kita|2011|pp=149, 154–155}}  At times Matabei has been credited as the artist of the unsigned [[Hikone screen]],{{sfn|Kita|1999|pp=44–45}} a ''{{transl|ja|[[byōbu]]}}'' folding screen that may be one of the earliest surviving ukiyo-e works.  The screen is in a refined Kanō style and depicts contemporary life, rather than the prescribed subjects of the painterly schools.{{sfn|Yashiro|1958|pp=216, 218}}

[[File:Moronobu b-w shunga.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A black-and-white illustration of a pair of lovers in splendid dress at play|Early woodblock print, [[Hishikawa Moronobu]], late 1670s or early 1680s]]&lt;!-- there is a really nice coloured version of this print on Commons.  Please don't replace this one with it, as there are few monochrome prints in the article. --&gt;

In response to the increasing demand for ukiyo-e works, [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] (1618–1694) produced the first ukiyo-e woodblock prints.{{sfn|Kikuchi|Kenny|1969|p=31}}  By 1672, Moronobu's success was such that he began to sign his work—the first of the book illustrators to do so.  He was a prolific illustrator who worked in a wide variety of genres, and developed an influential style of portraying female beauties.  Most significantly, he began to produce illustrations, not just for books, but as single-sheet images, which could stand alone or be used as part of a series.  The Hishikawa school attracted a large number of followers,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=70–71}} as well as imitators such as [[Sugimura Jihei]],{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=71–72}} and signalled the beginning of the popularization of a new artform.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=71}}

[[Torii Kiyonobu&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Kaigetsudō Ando]] became prominent emulators of Moronobu's style following the master's death, though neither was a member of the Hishikawa school.  Both discarded background detail in favour of focus on the human figure—[[kabuki]] actors in the ''[[yakusha-e]]'' of Kiyonobu and the [[Torii school]] that followed him,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=72–73}} and courtesans in the ''[[bijin-ga]]'' of Ando and his [[Kaigetsudō school]].  Ando and his followers produced a stereotyped female image whose design and pose lent itself to effective mass production,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=72–74}} and its popularity created a demand for paintings that other artists and schools took advantage of.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=75–76}}  The Kaigetsudō school and its popular "Kaigetsudō beauty" ended after Ando's exile over his role in the [[Ejima-Ikushima affair|Ejima-Ikushima scandal]] of 1714.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=74–75}}

Kyoto native [[Nishikawa Sukenobu]] (1671–1750) painted technically refined pictures of courtesans.{{sfn|Noma|1966|p=188}}  Considered a master of erotic portraits, he was the subject of a government ban in 1722, though it is believed he continued to create works that circulated under different names.{{sfn|Hibbett|2001|p=69}}  Sukenobu spent most of his career in Edo, and his influence was considerable in both the [[Kantō region|Kantō]] and [[Kansai region]]s.{{sfn|Noma|1966|p=188}}  The paintings of [[Miyagawa Chōshun]] (1683–1752) portrayed early 18th-century life in delicate colours.  Chōshun made no prints.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=154}}  The [[Miyagawa school]] he founded in the early-18th century specialized in romantic paintings in a style more refined in line and colour than the Kaigetsudō school.  Chōshun allowed greater expressive freedom in his adherents, a group that later included [[Hokusai]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=75–76}}

===Colour prints (mid-18th century)===

Even in the earliest monochromatic prints and books, colour was added by hand for special commissions.  Demand for colour in the early-18th century was met with ''tan-e''{{efn|{{nihongo||丹|tan}}: a pigment made from red lead mixed with sulphur and [[Niter|saltpetre]]{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=76}} }} prints hand-tinted with orange and sometimes green or yellow.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=76–77}}  These were followed in the 1720s with a vogue for pink-tinted ''beni-e''{{efn|{{Nihongo||紅|beni}}: a pigment produced from [[safflower]] petals.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}} }} and later the lacquer-like ink of the ''[[urushi-e]]''.  In 1744, the ''[[benizuri-e]]'' were the first successes in colour printing, using multiple woodblocks—one for each colour, the earliest ''beni'' pink and vegetable green.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}}

[[File:Okumura Masanobu - Taking the Evening Cool by Ryōgoku Bridge.png|thumb|left|Western-style [[perspective (graphical)|graphical perspective]] and increased use of printed colour were amongst the innovations [[Okumura Masanobu]] claimed.&lt;br/&gt;''Taking the Evening Cool by Ryōgoku Bridge'', {{circa|1745}}]]

A great self-promoter, [[Okumura Masanobu]] (1686–1764) played a major role during the period of rapid technical development in printing from the late 17th to mid-18th centuries.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=77}}  He established a shop in 1707{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=16}} and combined elements of the leading contemporary schools in a wide array of genres, though Masanobu himself belonged to no school.  Amongst the innovations in his romantic, lyrical images were the introduction of [[geometrical perspective]] in the ''[[uki-e]]'' genre{{efn|{{Interlanguage link multi|Torii Kiyotada|ja|3=鳥居清忠}} is said to have made the first ''uki-e'';{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}} Masanobu advertised himself as its innovator.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=78}}&lt;br /&gt;''A Layman's Explanation of the Rules of Drawing with a Compass and Ruler'' introduced Western-style geometrical perspective drawing to Japan in the 1734, based on a Dutch text of 1644 (see [[Rangaku]], "Dutch learning" during the Edo period); Chinese texts on the subject also appeared during the decade.{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}}&lt;br /&gt;Okumura likely learned about geometrical perspective from Chinese sources, some of which bear a striking resemblance to Okumura's works.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=64–68}} }} in the 1740s;{{sfn|Suwa|1998|p=64}} the long, narrow ''hashira-e'' prints; and the combination of graphics and literature in prints that included self-penned [[haiku]] poetry.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=77–79}}

Ukiyo-e reached a peak in the late 18th century with the advent of full-colour prints, developed after Edo returned to prosperity under [[Tanuma Okitsugu]] following a long depression.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=80–81}}  These popular colour prints came to be called ''[[nishiki-e]]'', or "brocade pictures", as their brilliant colours seemed to bear resemblance to imported Chinese Shuchiang [[brocade]]s, known in Japanese as ''Shokkō nishiki''.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=82}}  The first to emerge were expensive calendar prints, printed with multiple blocks on very fine&lt;!---or finer than standard--&gt; paper with heavy, opaque inks.  These prints had the number of days for each month hidden in the design, and were sent at the New Year{{efn|Until 1873 the [[Japanese calendar]] was [[Lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], and each year the [[Japanese New Year]] fell on different days of the [[Gregorian calendar]]'s January or February.}} as personalized greetings, bearing the name of the patron rather than the artist.  The blocks for these prints were later re-used for commercial production, obliterating the patron's name and replacing it with that of the artist.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=150, 152}}

The delicate, romantic prints of [[Suzuki Harunobu]] (1725–1770) were amongst the first to realize expressive and complex colour designs,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=81}} printed with up to a dozen separate blocks to handle the different colours{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=89}} and half-tones.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=155}}  His restrained, graceful prints invoked the classicism of [[waka (poetry)|waka]] poetry and [[Yamato-e]] painting.  The prolific Harunobu was the dominant ukiyo-e artist of his time.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=82–83}}  The success of Harunobu's colourful ''nishiki-e'' from 1765 on led to a steep decline in demand for the limited palettes of ''benizuri-e'' and ''urushi-e'', as well as hand-coloured prints.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=89}}

A trend against the idealism of the prints of Harunobu and the Torii school grew following Harunobu's death in 1770.  [[Katsukawa Shunshō]] (1726–1793) and [[Katsukawa school|his school]] produced portraits of kabuki actors with greater fidelity to the actors' actual features than had been the trend.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=83}}  Sometime-collaborators [[Koryūsai]] (1735&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|1790}}) and [[Kitao Shigemasa]] (1739–1820) were prominent depicters of women who also moved ukiyo-e away from the dominance of Harunobu's idealism by focusing on contemporary urban fashions and celebrated real-world courtesans and [[geisha]].{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=84–85}}  Koryūsai was perhaps the most prolific ukiyo-e artist of the 17th century, and produced a larger number of paintings and print series than any predecessor.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|p=3}}  The [[Kitao school]] that Shigemasa founded was one of the dominant schools of the closing decades of the 18th century.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}}

In the 1770s, [[Utagawa Toyoharu]] produced a number of ''uki-e'' perspective prints{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=68}} that demonstrated a mastery of Western perspective techniques that had eluded his predecessors in the genre.{{sfn|King|2010|p=47}}  Toyoharu's works helped pioneer the landscape as an ukiyo-e subject, rather than merely a background for human figures{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=1922|1p=224|2a1=Neuer|2a2=Libertson|2a3=Yoshida|2y=1990|2p=259}}  In 19th century, Western-style perspective techniques were absorbed into Japanese artistic culture, and deployed in the refined landscapes of such artists as Hokusai and [[Hiroshige]],{{sfn|Thompson|1986|p=44}} the latter a member of the [[Utagawa school]] that Toyoharu founded.  This school was to become one of the most influential,{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=204}} and produced works in a far greater variety of genres than any other school.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=105}}

===Peak period (late 18th century)===

[[File:Kitagawa Utamaro - Two Beauties with Bamboo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=A colour print of a close-up of the head and upper torso of a finely dressed Japanese woman.  Behind her is a bamboo screen on which is depicted a similar woman's head and upper torso.|''Two Beauties with Bamboo''&lt;br/&gt;[[Utamaro]], {{circa|1795}}]]

While the late 18th century saw hard economic times,{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=145}} ukiyo-e saw a peak in quantity and quality of works, particularly during the [[Kansei]] era (1789–1791).{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}}  The ukiyo-e of the period of the [[Kansei Reforms]] brought about a focus on beauty and harmony{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}} that collapsed into decadence and disharmony in the next century as the reforms broke down and tensions rose, culminating in the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}}

Especially in the 1780s, [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815){{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=85}} of the Torii school{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}} depicted traditional ukiyo-e subjects like beauties and urban scenes, which he printed on large sheets of paper, often as multiprint horizontal [[diptych]]s or [[triptych]]s.  His works dispensed with the poetic dreamscapes made by Harunobu, opting instead for realistic depictions of idealized female forms dressed in the latest fashions and posed in scenic locations.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=85–86}}  He also produced portraits of kabuki actors in a realistic style that included accompanying musicians and chorus.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=87}}

A law went into effect in 1790 requiring prints to bear a censor's seal of approval to be sold.  Censorship increased in strictness over the following decades, and violators could receive harsh punishments.  From 1799 even preliminary drafts required approval.{{sfn|Michener|1954|p=231}}  A group of Utagawa-school offenders including [[Utagawa Toyokuni|Toyokuni]] had their works repressed in 1801, and [[Utamaro]] was imprisoned in 1804 for making prints of 16th-century political and military leader&lt;!-- the source calls him "Shogun", but Hideyoshi was never appointed shogun --&gt; [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=224}}

Utamaro ({{circa|1753}}–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his ''bijin ōkubi-e'' ("large-headed pictures of beautiful women") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=87–88}}  Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background.  Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=88}}  By the end of the decade, especially following the death of his patron [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]] in 1797, Utamaro's prodigious output declined in quality,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=88–89}} and he died in 1806.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}

Appearing suddenly in 1794 and disappearing just as suddenly ten months later, the prints of the enigmatic [[Sharaku]] are amongst ukiyo-e's best known. Sharaku produced striking portraits of kabuki actors, introducing a greater level of realism into his prints that emphasized the differences between the actor and the portrayed character.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=91–92}}  The expressive, contorted faces he depicted contrasted sharply with the serene, mask-like faces more common to artists such as Harunobu or Utamaro.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=155}}  Published by Tsutaya,{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}} Sharaku's work found resistance, and in 1795 his output ceased as mysteriously as it had appeared, and his real identity is still unknown.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=89–91}}  Utagawa Toyokuni (1769–1825) produced kabuki portraits in a style Edo townsfolk found more accessible, emphasizing dramatic postures and avoiding Sharaku's realism.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=91–92}}

A consistent high level of quality marks ukiyo-e of the late 18th-century, but the works of Utamaro and Sharaku often overshadow those other masters  of the era.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}  One of Kiyonaga's followers,{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=91}} [[Eishi]] (1756–1829), abandoned his position as painter for ''shōgun'' [[Tokugawa Ieharu]] to take up ukiyo-e design.  He brought a refined sense to his portraits of graceful, slender courtesans, and left behind a number of noted students.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=40}}  With a fine line, [[Eishōsai Chōki]] (fl. 1786–1808) designed portraits of delicate courtesans.  The Utagawa school came to dominate ukiyo-e output in the late Edo period.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|pp=40–41}}

Edo was the primary centre of ukiyo-e production throughout the Edo period.  Another major centre developed in the [[Kamigata]] region of areas in and around [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]].  In contrast to the range of subjects in the Edo prints, those of Kamigata tended to be portraits of kabuki actors.  The style of the Kamigata prints was little distinguished from those of Edo until the late 18th century, partly because artists often moved back and forth between the two areas.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=38}}  Colours tend to be softer and pigments thicker in Kamigata prints than in those of Edo.{{sfn|Salter|2001|pp=12–13}}  In the 19th century many of the prints were designed by kabuki fans and other amateurs.{{sfn|Winegrad|2007|pp=18–19}}

===Late flowering: flora, fauna, and landscapes (19th century)===

[[File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg|thumb|alt=A colour illustration of a violent wave|[[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', 1831]]

The [[Tenpō Reforms]] of 1841–1843 sought to suppress outward displays of luxury, including the depiction of courtesans and actors. As a result, many ukiyo-e artists designed travel scenes and pictures of nature, especially birds and flowers.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=132}}  Landscapes had been given limited attention since Moronobu, and they formed an important element in the works of Kiyonaga and [[Katsukawa Shunchō|Shunchō]].  It was not until late in the Edo period that landscape came into its own as a genre, especially via the works of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].  The landscape genre has come to dominate Western perceptions of ukiyo-e, though ukiyo-e had a long history preceding these late-era masters.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=175}}  The Japanese landscape differed from the Western tradition in that it relied more heavily on imagination, composition, and atmosphere than on strict observance of nature.{{sfn|Michener|1959|pp=176–177}}

The self-proclaimed "mad painter" Hokusai (1760–1849) enjoyed a long, varied career.  His work is marked by a lack of the sentimentality common to ukiyo-e, and a focus on formalism influenced by Western art.  Among his accomplishments are his illustrations of [[Takizawa Bakin]]'s novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Crescent Moon (novel)|ja|3=椿説弓張月|lt=Crescent Moon}}'', his series of sketchbooks, the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'', and his popularization of the landscape genre with ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'',{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=92–93}} which includes his best-known print, ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1a2=Lewis|1y=2008|1p=385|2a1=Honour|2a2=Fleming|2y=2005|2p=709|3a1=Benfey|3y=2007|3p=17|4a1=Addiss|4a2=Groemer|4a3=Rimer|4y=2006|4p=146|5a1=Buser|5y=2006|5p=168}} one of the most famous works of Japanese art.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1a2=Lewis|1y=2008|1p=385|2a1=Belloli|2y=1999|2p=98}}  In contrast to the work of the older masters, Hokusai's colours were bold, flat, and abstract, and his subject was not the pleasure districts but the lives and environment of the common people at work.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=158}}  Established masters [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]], [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi|Kuniyoshi]], and [[Kunisada]] also followed Hokusai's steps into landscape prints in the 1830s, producing prints with bold compositions and striking effects.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=84–85}}

Though not often given the attention of their better-known forebears, the Utagawa school produced a few masters in this declining period.  The prolific Kunisada (1786–1865) had few rivals in the tradition of making portrait prints of courtesans and actors.{{sfn|Lane|1962|pp=284–285}}  One of those rivals was Eisen (1790–1848), who was also adept at landscapes.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=290}}  Perhaps the last significant member of this late period, Kuniyoshi (1797–1861) tried his hand at a variety of themes and styles, much as Hokusai had.  His historical scenes of warriors in violent combat were popular,{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=285}} especially his series of heroes from the ''[[Water Margin|Suikoden]]'' (1827–1830) and ''[[Chūshingura]]'' (1847).{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=153–154}} He was adept at landscapes and satirical scenes—the latter an area rarely explored in the dictatorial atmosphere of the Edo period; that Kuniyoshia could dare tackle such subjects was a sign of the weakening of the shogunate at the time.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=285}}

Hiroshige (1797–1858) is considered Hokusai's greatest rival in stature.  He specialized in pictures of birds and flowers, and serene landscapes, and is best known for his travel series, such as ''[[The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō]]'' and ''[[The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō]]'',{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=94–95}} the latter a cooperative effort with Eisen.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=290}}  His work was more realistic, subtly coloured, and atmospheric than Hokusai's; nature and the seasons were key elements: mist, rain, snow, and moonlight were prominent parts of his compositions.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|pp=158–159}}  Hiroshige's followers, including [[Japanese adult adoption|adopted]] son [[Hiroshige II]] and son-in-law [[Hiroshige III]], carried on their master's style of landscapes into the Meiji era.{{sfn|King|2010|p=116}}

===Decline (late 19th century)===

Following the deaths of Hokusai and Hiroshige{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=200}} and the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e suffered a sharp decline in quantity and quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Michener|1y=1959|1p=200|2a1=Kobayashi|2y=1997|2p=95}}  The rapid Westernization of the [[Meiji period]] that followed saw woodblock printing turn its services to journalism, and face competition from photography.  Practitioners of pure ukiyo-e became more rare, and tastes turned away from a genre seen as a remnant of an obsolescent era.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=200}}  Artists continued to produce occasional notable works, but by the 1890s the tradition was moribund.{{sfnm|1a1=Kobayashi|1y=1997|1p=95|2a1=Faulkner|2a2=Robinson|2y=1999|2pp=22–23|3a1=Kobayashi|3y=1997|3p=95|4a1=Michener|4y=1959|4p=200}}

Synthetic pigments imported from Germany began to replace traditional organic ones in the mid-19th century.  Many prints from this era made extensive use of a bright red, and were called ''[[aka-e]]'' ("red pictures").{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=71}}  Artists such as [[Yoshitoshi]] (1839–1892) led a trend in the 1860s of gruesome scenes of murders and ghosts,{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=69}} monsters and supernatural beings, and legendary Japanese and Chinese heroes.  His ''One Hundred Aspects of the Moon'' (1885–1892) depicts a variety of fantastic and mundane themes with a moon motif.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=153}}  [[Kobayashi Kiyochika|Kiyochika]] (1847–1915) is known for his prints documenting the rapid modernization of Tokyo, such as the introduction of railways, and his depictions of Japan's wars [[First Sino-Japanese War|with China]] and [[Russo-Japanese War|with Russia]].{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=69}} Earlier a painter of the Kanō school, in the 1870s [[Toyohara Chikanobu|Chikanobu]] (1838–1912) turned to prints, particularly of the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial family]] and scenes of Western influence on Japanese life in the Meiji period.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1986|pp=125–126}}

Aside from Dutch traders, who had had [[Japan–Netherlands relations|trading relations]] dating to the beginning of the Edo period,{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}} Westerners paid little notice to Japanese art before the mid-19th century, and when they did they rarely distinguished it from other art from the East.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}}  Swedish naturalist [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] spent a year in the Dutch trading settlement [[Dejima]], near Nagasaki, and was one of the earliest Westerners to collect Japanese prints.  The export of ukiyo-e thereafter slowly grew, and at the beginning of the 19th century Dutch merchant-trader [[Isaac Titsingh]]'s collection drew the attention of connoisseurs of art in Paris.{{sfn|Neuer|Libertson|Yoshida|1990|p=48}}

The arrival in Edo of American Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] in 1853 led to the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] in 1854, which opened Japan to the outside world after [[Sakoku|over two centuries of seclusion]].  Ukiyo-e prints were amongst the items he brought back to the United States.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163}}  Such prints had appeared in Paris from at least the 1830s, and by the 1850s were numerous;{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=93}} reception was mixed, and even when praised ukiyo-e was generally thought inferior to Western works which emphasized mastery of naturalistic perspective and anatomy.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|pp=680–681}}  Japanese art drew notice at the [[International Exposition (1867)|International Exhibition of 1867 in Paris]],{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}} and became fashionable in France and England in the 1870s and 1880s.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=667}}  The prints of Hokusai and Hiroshige played a prominent role in shaping Western perceptions of Japanese art.{{sfn|Watanabe|1984|p=675}}  At the time of their introduction to the West, woodblock printing was the most common mass medium in Japan, and the Japanese considered it of little lasting value.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=12}}

Early Europeans promoters and scholars of ukiyo-e and Japanese art included writer [[Edmond de Goncourt]] and art critic [[Philippe Burty]],{{sfn|Weisberg|Rakusin|Rakusin|1986|p=7}} who coined the term "[[Japonism]]".{{sfn|Weisberg|1975|p=120}}{{efn|Burty coined the term ''{{lang|fr|le Japonisme}}'' in French in 1872.{{sfn|Weisberg|1975|p=120}} }}  Stores selling Japanese goods opened, including those of Édouard Desoye in 1862 and art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]] in 1875.{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|p=89}}  From 1888 to 1891 Bing published the magazine ''[[Artistic Japan]]''{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=96}} in English, French, and German editions,{{sfn|Weisberg|Rakusin|Rakusin|1986|p=6}} and curated an ukiyo-e exhibition at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1890 attended by artists such as [[Mary Cassatt]].{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|p=90}}

[[File:Debussy - La Mer - The great wave of Kanaga from Hokusai.jpg|thumb|alt=Cover of book of sheet music depicting a stylized wave|Not only the visual arts but also music drew inspiration from ukiyo-e in the West: the cover of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1905).]]

American [[Ernest Fenollosa]] was the earliest Western devotee of Japanese culture, and did much to promote Japanese art—Hokusai's works featured prominently at his inaugural exhibition as first curator of Japanese art [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston, and in Tokyo in 1898 he curated the first ukiyo-e exhibition in Japan.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|pp=101–103}} By the end of the 19th century, the popularity of ukiyo-e in the West drove prices beyond the means of most collectors—some, such as [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], traded their own paintings for such prints.  [[Tadamasa Hayashi]] was a prominent Paris-based dealer of respected tastes whose Tokyo office was responsible for evaluating and exporting large quantities of ukiyo-e prints to the West in such quantities that Japanese critics later accused him of siphoning Japan of its national treasure.{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|pp=96–97}}  The drain first went unnoticed in Japan, as Japanese artists were immersing themselves in the classical painting techniques of the West.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=15}}

Japanese art, and particularly ukiyo-e prints, came to influence Western art from the time of the early [[Impressionism|Impressionist]]s.{{sfn|Mansfield|2009|p=134}}  Early painter-collectors incorporated Japanese themes and compositional techniques into their works as early as the 1860s:{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=93}} the patterned wallpapers and rugs in [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]'s paintings were inspired by ukiyo-e's patterned kimonos, and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] focused his attention on ephemeral elements of nature as in ukiyo-e landscapes.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=17}}  [[Vincent van Gogh|Van&amp;nbsp;Gogh]] was an avid collector, and painted [[Copies by Vincent van Gogh|copies in oil]] of prints by Hiroshige and [[Keisai Eisen|Eisen]].{{sfn|Sullivan|1989|p=230}}  Degas and Cassatt depicted fleeting, everyday moments in Japanese-influenced compositions and perspectives.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=37–39, 45}}  Ukiyo-e's flat perspective and unmodulated colours were a particular influence on graphic designers and poster makers.{{sfn|Jobling|Crowley|1996|pp=90–91}}  [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]]'s lithographs displayed his interest not only in ukiyo-e's flat colours and outlined forms, but also in their subject matter: performers and prostitutes.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=80}}  He signed much of this work with his initials in a circle, imitating the seals on Japanese prints.{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=80}}  Other artists of the time who drew influence from ukiyo-e include [[Claude Monet|Monet]],{{sfn|Mansfield|2009|p=134}} [[John La Farge|La Farge]],{{sfn|Meech-Pekarik|1982|p=99}} [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]],{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=96}} and [[Les Nabis]] members such as [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]]{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=56}} and [[Édouard Vuillard|Vuillard]].{{sfn|Ives|1974|p=67}}  French composer [[Claude Debussy]] drew inspiration for his music from the prints of Hokusai and Horoshige, most prominently in ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1905).{{sfn|Gerstle|Milner|1995|p=70}}  [[Imagism|Imagist]] poets such as [[Amy Lowell]] and [[Ezra Pound]] found inspiration in ukiyo-e prints; Lowell published a book of poetry called ''Pictures of the Floating World'' (1919) on oriental themes or in an oriental style.{{sfn|Hughes|1960|p=213}}

===Descendant traditions (20th century)===

[[File:Yamamoto 1904.jpg|thumb|alt=Monochromatic print of a man in a heavy coat standing, looking away from the viewer at the ocean|''Fisherman''&lt;br/&gt;[[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]], 1904]]
The travel sketchbook became a popular genre beginning about 1905, as the Meiji government promoted travel within Japan to have citizens better know their country.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=119, 121}}  In 1915, publisher [[Shōzaburō Watanabe]] introduced the term ''[[shin-hanga]]'' ("new prints") to describe a style of prints he published that featured traditional Japanese subject matter and were aimed at foreign and upscale Japanese audiences.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=81}}  Prominent artists included [[Goyō Hashiguchi]], called the "Utamaro of the [[Taishō period]]" for his manner of depicting women; [[Shinsui Itō]], who brought more modern sensibilities to images of women;{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=2006|1p=22|2a1=Seton|2y=2010|2p=81}} and [[Hasui Kawase]], who made modern landscapes.{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=2006|1p=23|2a1=Seton|2y=2010|2p=81}}  Watanabe also published works by non-Japanese artists, an early success of which was a set of Indian- and Japanese-themed prints in 1916 by the English [[Charles W. Bartlett]] (1860–1940). Other publishers followed Watanabe's success, and some shin-hanga artists such as Goyō and [[Hiroshi Yoshida]] set up studios to publish their own work.{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=21}}

Artists of the ''[[sōsaku-hanga]]'' ("creative prints") movement took control of every aspect of the printmaking process—design, carving, and printing were by the same pair of hands.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=81}}  [[Kanae Yamamoto (artist)|Kanae Yamamoto]] (1882–1946), then a student at the [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Tokyo School of Fine Arts]], is credited with the birth of this approach. In 1904, he produced ''Fisherman'' using woodblock printing, a technique until then frowned upon by the Japanese art establishment as old-fashioned and for its association with commercial mass production.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=109}}  The foundation of the [[Japanese Woodcut Artists' Association]] in 1918 marks the beginning of this approach as a movement.{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=181}}  The movement favoured individuality in its artists, and as such has no dominant themes or styles.{{sfn|Statler|1959|p=39}}  Works ranged from the entirely abstract ones of [[Kōshirō Onchi]] (1891–1955) to the traditional figurative depictions of Japanese scenes of [[Un'ichi Hiratsuka]] (1895–1997).{{sfn|Munsterberg|1957|p=181}}  These artists produced prints not because they hoped to reach a mass audience, but as a creative end in itself, and did not restrict their print media to the woodblock of traditional ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Statler|1959|pp=35–38}}

&lt;!-- let's avoid using "kindai hanga" -- the term isn't set in stone the way "shin-hanga" and "sōsaku-hanga" are --&gt;Prints from the late-20th and 21st centuries have evolved from the concerns of earlier movements, especially the sōsaku-hanga movement's emphasis on individual expression.  [[Screen printing]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[mixed media]], and other Western methods have joined traditional woodcutting amongst printmakers' techniques.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999}}

The colours are bold and flat, and the contours are outlined in black.|''Woman Visiting the Shrine in the Night'', [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]], 17th century. Bold, flat lines define and contain areas of flat colour.]]

Early ukiyo-e artists brought with them a sophisticated knowledge of and training in the composition principles of classical [[Chinese painting]]; gradually these artists shed the overt Chinese influence to develop a native Japanese idiom.  The early ukiyo-e artists have been called "Primitives" in the sense that the print medium was a new challenge to which they adapted these centuries-old techniques—their image designs are not considered "primitive".{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|pp=9–11}}  Many ukiyo-e artists received training from teachers of the Kanō and other painterly schools.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=9}}

A defining feature of most ukiyo-e prints is a well-defined, bold, flat line.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2004|1p=xiv|2a1=Michener|2y=1959|2p=11}}  The earliest prints were monochromatic, and these lines were the only printed element; even with the advent of colour this characteristic line continued to dominate.{{sfn|Michener|1959|pp=11–12}}  In ukiyo-e composition forms are arranged in flat spaces{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=90}} with figures typically in a single plane of depth.  Attention was drawn to vertical and horizontal relationships, as well as details such as lines, shapes, and patterns such as those on clothing.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=xvi}}  Compositions were often asymmetrical, and the viewpoint was often from unusual angles, such as from above.  Elements of images were often [[Cropping (image)|cropped]], giving the composition a spontaneous feel.{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=298}}  In colour prints, contours of most colour areas are sharply defined, usually by the linework.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=34}}  The aesthetic of flat areas of colour contrasts with the modulated colours expected in Western traditions{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=90}} and with other prominent contemporary traditions in Japanese art patronized by the upper class, such as in the subtle monochrome [[Ink wash painting|ink brushstrokes]] of [[zenga]] brush painting or tonal colours of the [[Kanō school]] of painting.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=34}}

[[File:Black Raku Tea Bowl.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of a tea bowl, dark-coloured, humble, and asymmetric|''[[Wabi-sabi]]'' aesthetic in a 16th-century tea bowl]]

The colourful, ostentatious, and complex patterns, concern with changing fashions, and tense, dynamic poses and compositions in ukiyo-e are in striking contrast with many concepts in traditional [[Japanese aesthetics]].  Prominent amongst these, ''[[wabi-sabi]]'' favours simplicity, asymmetry, and imperfection, with evidence of the passage of time;{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=50–52}} and ''[[shibui]]'' values subtlety, humility, and restraint.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=53–54}}  Ukiyo-e can be less at odds with aesthetic concepts such as the racy, urbane stylishness of ''[[iki (aesthetics)|iki]]''.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=66}}

Ukiyo-e displays an unusual approach to graphical perspective, one that can appear underdeveloped when compared to European paintings of the same period.  Western-style geometrical perspective was known in Japan—practised most prominently by the [[Akita ranga]] painters of the 1770s—as were Chinese methods to create a sense of depth using a homogeny of parallel lines.  The techniques sometimes appeared together in ukiyo-e works, geometrical perspective providing an illusion of depth in the background and the more expressive Chinese perspective in the fore.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=57–60}}  The techniques were most likely learned at first through Chinese Western-style paintings rather than directly from Western works.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=62–63}}  Long after becoming familiar with these techniques, artists continued to harmonize them with traditional methods according to their compositional and expressive needs.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=106–107}}  Other ways of indicating depth included the Chinese tripartite composition method&lt;!-- 三部構図法 --&gt; used in Buddhist pictures,&lt;!-- 仏画 --&gt; where a large form is placed in the foreground, a smaller in the midground, and yet a smaller in the background; this can be seen in Hokusai's ''Great Wave'', with a large boat in the foreground, a smaller behind it, and a small Mt Fuji behind them.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=108–109}}

There was a tendency since early ukiyo-e to pose beauties in what art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Midori Wakakura|ja|3=若桑みどり}} called a "serpentine posture",{{efn|{{lang|ja|蛇体姿勢}} ''{{transl|ja|jatai shisei}}'', "serpentine posture"}} which involves the subjects' bodies twisting unnaturally while facing behind themselves.  Art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Motoaki Kōno|ja|3=河野元昭}} posited that this had its roots in traditional [[buyō]] dance; {{Interlanguage link multi|Haruo Suwa|ja|3=諏訪春雄}} countered that the poses were artistic licence taken by ukiyo-e artists, causing a seemingly relaxed pose to reach unnatural or impossible physical extremes.  This remained the case even when realistic perspective techniques were applied to other sections of the composition.{{sfn|Suwa|1998|pp=101–106}}

===Themes and genres===

Typical subjects were female beauties ("'[[bijin-ga]]'"), kabuki actors ("'[[yakusha-e]]'"), and landscapes.  The women depicted were most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments to be found in the pleasure districts.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=60}}  The detail with which artists depicted courtesans' fashions and hairstyles allows the prints to be dated with some reliability.  Less attention was given to accuracy of the women's physical features, which followed the day's pictorial fashions—the faces stereotyped, the bodies tall and lanky in one generation and petite in another.{{sfn|Hillier|1954|p=20}}  Portraits of celebrities were much in demand, in particular those from the kabuki and [[sumo]] worlds, two of the most popular entertainments of the era.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=95, 98}}  While the landscape has come to define ukiyo-e for many Westerners, landscapes flourished relatively late in the ukiyo-e's history.{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=175}}

[[File:Suzuki Harunobu - Evening Snow on the Heater.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour print of two finely dressed Japanese women by a heater.  The wallpaper and other items are extensively embossed.|Portraits of beauties were a mainstay of ukiyo-e.  The wallpaper and other items in this [[nishiki-e|brocade print]] are extensively [[paper embossing|embossed]].&lt;br/&gt;''[[Evening Snow on the Nurioke]]'', [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]], 1766]]

Ukiyo-e prints grew out of book illustration—many of Moronobu's earliest single-page prints were originally pages from books he had illustrated.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}  ''[[E-hon]]'' books of illustrations were popular{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=41}} and continued be an important outlet for ukiyo-e artists. In the late period, Hokusai produced the three-volume ''One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji'' and the fifteen-volume ''Hokusai Manga'', the latter a compendium of over 4000 sketches of a wide variety of realistic and fantastic subjects.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=38, 41}}

Traditional Japanese religions do not consider sex or pornography a moral corruption in the [[Judaeo-Christian]] sense,{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=124}} and until the changing morals of the Meiji era led to its suppression, [[shunga]] erotic prints were a major genre.{{sfnm|1a1=Seton|1y=2010|1p=64|2a1=Harris|2y=2011|p=119}}  While the Tokugawa regime subjected Japan to strict censorship laws, pornography was not considered an important offence and generally met with the censors' approval.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=224}}  Many of these prints displayed a high level a draughtsmanship, and often humour, in their explicit depictions of bedroom scenes, voyeurs, and oversized anatomy.{{sfn|Seton|2010|p=64}}  As with depictions of courtesans, these images were closely tied to entertainments of the pleasure quarters.{{sfn|Screech|1999|p=15}}  Nearly every ukiyo-e master produced shunga at some point.{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=128}}  Records of societal acceptance of shunga are absent, though [[Timon Screech]] posits that there were almost certainly some concerns over the matter, and that its level of acceptability has been exaggerated by later collectors, especially in the West.{{sfn|Screech|1999|p=15}}

Scenes from nature have been an important part of Asian art throughout history.  Artists have closely studied the correct forms and anatomy of plants and animals, even though depictions of human anatomy remained more fanciful until modern times.  Ukiyo-e nature prints are called ''[[kachō-e]]'', which translates as "flower-and-bird pictures", though the genre was open to more than just flowers or birds, and the flowers and birds did not necessarily appear together.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=132}}  Hokusai's detailed, precise nature prints are credited with establishing ''kachō-e'' as a genre.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=134}}

The Tenpō Reforms of the 1840s suppressed the depiction of actors and courtesans.  Aside from landscapes and ''kachō-e'', artists turned to depictions of historical scenes, such as of ancient warriors or of scenes from legend, literature, and religion.  The 11th-century ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]''{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}} and the 13th-century ''[[The Tale of the Heike|Tale of the Heike]]''{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=155–156}} have been sources of artistic inspiration throughout Japanese history,{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}} including in ukiyo-e.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=146}}  Well-known warriors and swordsmen such as [[Miyamoto Musashi]] (1584–1645) were frequent subjects, as were depictions of monsters, the supernatural, and heroes of [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] and [[Chinese mythology]].{{sfn|Harris|2011|pp=148, 153}}

From the 17th to 19th centuries [[Sakoku|Japan isolated itself]] from the rest of the world.  Trade, primarily with the Dutch and Chinese, was restricted to the island of [[Dejima]] near [[Nagasaki]].  Outlandish pictures called ''Nagasaki-e'' were sold to tourists of the foreigners and their wares.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163}}  In the mid-19th century, [[Yokohama]] became the primary foreign settlement after 1859, from which Western knowledge proliferated in Japan.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=163–164}}  Especially from 1858 to 1862 ''[[Yokohama-e]]'' prints documented, with various levels of fact and fancy, the growing community of world denizens with whom the Japanese were now coming in contact;{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=166–167}} triptychs of scenes of Westerners and their technology were particularly popular.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=170}}

Specialized prints included ''[[surimono]]'', deluxe, limited-edition prints aimed at connoisseurs, of which a five-line [[kyōka]] poem was usually part of the design;{{sfn|King|2010|p=111}} and ''[[uchiwa-e]]'' printed [[hand fan]]s, which often suffer from having been handled.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=37}}

{{Main|Nikuhitsu-ga}}

Ukiyo-e artists often made both prints and paintings; some specialized in one or the other.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}  In contrast with previous traditions, ukiyo-e painters favoured bright, sharp colours,{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=xii}} and often delineated contours with [[inkstick|sumi ink]], an effect similar to the linework in prints.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=236}}  Unrestricted by the technical limitations of printing, a wider range of techniques, pigments, and surfaces were available to the painter.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=235–236}}  Artists painted with pigments made from mineral or organic substances, such as [[safflower]], ground shells, lead, and [[cinnabar]],{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|pp=29, 34}} and later synthetic dyes imported from the West such as [[Paris green]] and Prussian blue.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|pp=35–36}}  Silk or paper  ''[[kakemono]]'' hanging scrolls, ''makimono'' [[handscroll]]s, or ''[[byōbu]]'' folding screens were the most common surfaces.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}

{{Main article|Woodblock printing in Japan}}

Ukiyo-e prints were the works of teams of artisans in several workshops;{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}} it was rare for designers to cut their own woodblocks.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=21}}  Labour was divided into four groups: the publisher, who commissioned, promoted, and distributed the prints; the artists, who provided the design image; the woodcarvers, who prepared the woodblocks for printing; and the printers, who made impressions of the woodblocks on paper.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=11}}  Normally only the names of the artist and publisher were credited on the finished print.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=61}}

Ukiyo-e prints were impressed on [[Washi|hand-made paper]]{{sfn|Michener|1959|p=11}} manually, rather than by mechanical press as in the West.{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=1}}  The artist provided an ink drawing on thin paper, which was pasted{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=64}} to a block of cherry wood{{efn|Traditional Japanese woodblocks were cut along the grain, as opposed to the blocks of Western [[wood engraving]], which were cut across the grain.  In both methods, the dimensions of the woodblock was limited by the girth of the tree.{{sfn|Statler|1959|pp=34–35}}  In the 20th century, [[plywood]] became the material of choice for Japanese woodcarvers, as it is cheaper, easier to carve, and less limited in size.{{sfnm|1a1=Statler|1y=1959|1pp=34–35|2a1=Salter|2y=2001|1p=64}} }} and rubbed with oil until the upper layers of paper could be pulled away, leaving a translucent layer of paper that the block-cutter could use as a guide. The block-cutter cut away the non-black areas of the image, leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}  The original drawing was destroyed in the process.{{sfn|Salter|2001|p=64}}

Prints were made with blocks face up so the printer could vary pressure for different effects, and watch as paper absorbed the water-based sumi ink,{{sfn|Penkoff|1964|p=1}} applied quickly in even horizontal strokes.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=225}}  Amongst the printer's tricks were [[Paper embossing|embossing]] of the image, achieved by pressing an uninked woodblock on the paper to achieve effects, such as the textures of clothing patterns or fishing net.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=246}}  Other effects included burnishing{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=247}} by rubbing with [[agate]] to brighten colours;{{sfn|Frédéric|2002|p=884}} [[varnish]]ing; [[overprinting]]; dusting with metal or [[mica]]; and sprays to imitate falling snow.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=247}}

The ukiyo-e print was a commercial art form, and the publisher played an important role.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}}  Publishing was highly competitive; over a thousand publishers are known from throughout the period.  The number peaked at around 250 in the 1840s and 1850s{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=180}}—200 in Edo alone{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=19}}—and slowly shrank following the opening of Japan until about 40 remained at the opening of the 20th century.  The publishers owned the woodblocks and copyrights, and from the late 18th century enforced copyrights{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=180}} through the Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild.{{efn|{{nihongo||地本問屋|Jihon Toiya}} "Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild"{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}} }}{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}  Prints that went through several pressings were particularly profitable, as the publisher could reuse the woodblocks without further payment to the artist or woodblock cutter.  The woodblocks were also traded or sold to other publishers or pawnshops.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=18}}  Publishers were usually also vendors, and commonly sold each other's wares in their shops.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}  In addition to the artist's seal, publishers marked the prints with their own seals—some a simple logo, others quite elaborate, incorporating an address or other information.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}}

[[File:Tsutaya Jūzaburō seal.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A publisher's seal in the shape of a flower within a stylized mountain|The publisher's seal of [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]], who published [[Utamaro]] and [[Sharaku]] in the 1790s]]

Print designers went through apprenticeship before being granted the right to produce prints of their own that they could sign with their own names.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=13}}  Young designers could be expected to cover part or all of the costs of cutting the woodblocks.  As the artists gained fame publishers usually covered these costs, and artists could demand higher fees.{{sfn|Marks|2012|pp=13–14}}

In pre-modern Japan, people could go by numerous names throughout their lives, their childhood ''{{transl|ja|yōmyō}}'' personal name different from their ''zokumyō'' name as an adult.  An artist's name consisted of a ''{{transl|ja|gasei}}'' artist surname followed by an ''{{transl|ja|azana}}'' personal art name.  The ''{{transl|ja|gasei}}'' was most frequently taken from the school the artist belonged to, such as Utagawa or Torii,{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=22}} and the ''{{transl|ja|azana}}'' normally took a Chinese character from the master's art name—for example, many students of Toyokuni (豊国) took the "kuni" (国) from his name, including Kunisada (国貞) and Kuniyoshi (国芳).{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=13}}  The names artists signed to their works can be a source of confusion as they sometimes changed names through their careers;{{sfn|Merritt|1990|pp=ix–x}}  Hokusai was an extreme case, using over a hundred names throughout his seventy-year career.{{sfn|Link|Takahashi|1977|p=32}}

The prints were mass-marketed{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}} and by the mid-19th century total circulation of a print could run into the thousands.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2008|pp=153—154}}  Retailers and travelling sellers promoted them at prices affordable to prosperous townspeople.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=2011|1p=62|2a1=Meech-Pekarik|2y=1982|2p=93}}  In some cases the prints advertised [[kimono]] designs by the print artist.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=62}}  From the second half of the 17th century, prints were frequently marketed as part of a series,{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}} each print stamped with the series name and the print's number in that series.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=48–49}}  This proved a successful marketing technique, as collectors bought each new print in the series to keep their collections complete.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=21}}  By the 19th century, series such as Hiroshige's ''Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō'' ran to dozens of prints.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=48–49}}

====Colour print production====

While [[colour printing]] in Japan dates to the 1640s, early ukiyo-e prints used only black ink.  Colour was sometimes added by hand, using a red lead ink in ''tan-e'' prints, or later in a pink safflower ink in ''beni-e'' prints.  Colour printing arrived in books in the 1720s and in single-sheet prints in the 1740s, with a different block and printing for each colour.  Early colours were limited to pink and green; techniques expanded over the following two decades to allow up to five colours.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}  The mid-1760s brought full-colour ''nishiki-e'' prints{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}} made from ten or more woodblocks.{{sfnm|1a1=Ishizawa|1a2=Tanaka|1y=1986|1p=38|2a1=Merritt|2y=1990|2p=18}}  To keep the blocks for each colour aligned correctly [[Printing registration|registration marks]] called ''kentō'' were placed on one corner and an adjacent side.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=27}}

[[File:Pigment Berliner Blau.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of a dish of deep blue powder|[[Prussian blue]] was a prominent synthetic dye in the 19th century.]]

Printers first used [[Natural dye|natural colour dyes]] made from mineral or vegetable sources.  The dyes had a translucent quality that allowed a variety of colours to be mixed from [[Primary color|primary]] red, blue, and yellow pigments.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=26}}  In the 18th century, [[Prussian blue]] became popular, and was particularly prominent in the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige,{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=26}} as was ''[[bokashi (printing)|bokashi]]'', where the printer produced gradations of colour or the blending of one colour into another.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=31}}  Cheaper and more consistent synthetic [[aniline]] dyes arrived from the West in 1864.  The colours were harsher and brighter than traditional pigments.  The [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]] promoted their use as part of broader policies of Westernization.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=234}}

==Criticism and historiography==

Contemporary records of ukiyo-e artists are rare.  The most significant is the ''[[Ukiyo-e Ruikō]]'' ("''Various Thoughts on Ukiyo-e''"), a collection of commentaries and artist biographies.  [[Ōta Nanpo]] compiled the first, no-longer-extant version around 1790.  The work did not see print during the Edo era, but circulated in hand-copied editions that were subject to numerous additions and alterations;{{sfn|Takeuchi|2004|pp=118, 120}} over 120 variants of the ''Ukiyo-e Ruikō'' are known.{{sfn|Tanaka|1999|p=190}}

Before World War II, the predominant view of ukiyo-e stressed the centrality of prints; this viewpoint ascribes ukiyo-e's founding to Moronobu.  Following the war, thinking turned to the importance of ukiyo-e painting and making direct connections with 17th-century Yamato-e paintings; this viewpoint sees Matabei as the genre's originator, and is especially favoured in Japan.  This view had become widespread among Japanese researchers by the 1930s, but the militaristic government of the time suppressed it, wanting to emphasize a division between the Yamato-e scroll paintings associated with the court, and the prints associated with the sometimes anti-authoritarian merchant class.{{sfn|Kita|2011|pp=149, 154–155}}

[[File:Ernest Fenollosa.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A black-and-white profile photograph of the head and shoulders of a middle-aged bearded man, facing left|American scholar of Japanese art [[Ernest Fenollosa]] was the first to complete a comprehensive critical history of ukiyo-e.]]

The earliest comprehensive historical and critical works on ukiyo-e came from the West.  Ernest Fenollosa was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Tokyo|Imperial University]] in Tokyo from 1878, and was Commissioner of Fine Arts to the Japanese government from 1886.  His ''Masters of {{not a typo|Ukioye}}'' of 1896 was the first comprehensive overview and set the stage for most later works with an approach to the history in terms of epochs: beginning with Matabei in a primitive age, it evolved towards a late-18th-century golden age that began to decline with the advent of Utamaro, and had a brief revival with Hokusai and Hiroshige's landscapes in the 1830s.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=3–5}}  [[Laurence Binyon]], the Keeper of Oriental Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote an account in ''Painting in the Far East'' in 1908 that was similar to Fenollosa's, but placed Utamaro and Sharaku amongst the masters.  [[Arthur Davison Ficke]] built on the works of Fenollosa and Binyon with a more comprehensive ''Chats on Japanese Prints'' in 1915.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=8–10}}  [[James&amp;nbsp;A. Michener]]'s ''The Floating World'' in 1954 broadly followed the chronologies of the earlier works, while dropping classifications into periods and recognizing the earlier artists not as primitives but as accomplished masters emerging from earlier painting traditions.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=12}}  For Michener and his sometime collaborator [[Richard Douglas Lane|Richard Lane]], ukiyo-e began with Moronobu rather than Matabei.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=20}}  Lane's ''Masters of the Japanese Print'' of 1962 maintained the approach of period divisions while placing ukiyo-e firmly within the genealogy of Japanese art.  The book acknowledges artists such as Yoshitoshi and Kiyochika as late masters.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=13–14}}

{{Interlanguage link multi|Seiichirō Takahashi|ja|3=高橋誠一郎}}'s ''Traditional Woodblock Prints of Japan'' of 1964 placed ukiyo-e artists in three periods: the first was a primitive period that included Harunobu, followed by a golden age of Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku, and then a closing period of decline following the declaration beginning in the 1790s of strict [[sumptuary law]]s that dictated what could be depicted in artworks.  The book nevertheless recognizes a larger number of masters from throughout this last period than earlier works had,{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=14–15}} and viewed ukiyo-e painting as a revival of Yamato-e painting.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=155}}  {{Interlanguage link multi|Tadashi Kobayashi|ja|3=小林忠}} further refined Takahashi's analysis by identifying the decline as coinciding with the desperate attempts of the shogunate to hold on to power through the passing of draconian laws as its hold on the country continued to break down, culminating in the Meiji Restoration in 1868.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=15–16}}

Ukiyo-e scholarship has tended to focus on the cataloguing of artists, an approach that lacks the rigour and originality that has come to be applied to art analysis in other areas.  Such catalogues are numerous, but tend overwhelmingly to concentrate on a group of recognized geniuses.  Little original research has been added to the early, foundational evaluations of ukiyo-e and its artists, especially with regard to relatively minor artists.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=13–14}}  While the commercial nature of ukiyo-e has always been acknowledged, evaluation of artists and their works has rested on the aesthetic preferences of connoisseurs and paid little heed to contemporary commercial success.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=5–6}}

Standards for inclusion in the ukiyo-e canon rapidly evolved in the early literature.  Utamaro was particularly contentious, seen by Fenollosa and others as a degenerate symbol of ukiyo-e's decline; Utamaro has since gained general acceptance as one of the form's greatest masters.  Artists of the 19th century such as Yoshitoshi were ignored or marginalized, attracting scholarly attention only towards the end of the 20th century.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=17–18}}  Works on late-era Utagawa artists such as Kunisada and Kuniyoshi have revived some of the contemporary esteem these artists enjoyed.  Many late works examine the social or other conditions behind the art, and are unconcerned with valuations that would place it in a period of decline.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=19–20}}

Novelist [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]] was critical of the superior attitude of Westerners who claimed a higher aestheticism in purporting to have discovered ukiyo-e.  He maintained that ukiyo-e was merely the easiest form of Japanese art to understand from the perspective of Westerners' values, and that Japanese of all social strata enjoyed ukiyo-e, but that Confucian morals of the time kept them from freely discussing it, social mores that were violated by the West's flaunting of the discovery.{{sfn|Yoshimoto|2003|p=65–66}}

[[File:Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white comic strip in Japanese|[[Manga]] histories often find an ancestor in the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]''.&lt;br/&gt;[[Rakuten Kitazawa]], ''Tagosaku to Mokube no Tōkyō Kenbutsu'',{{efn|''{{transl|ja|Tagosaku to Mokube no Tokyo Kenbutsu}}'' {{lang|ja|田吾作と杢兵衛の東京見物}} ''Tagosaku and Mokube Sightseeing in Tokyo''}} 1902]]

Since the dawn of the 20th century historians of ''{{transl|ja|[[manga]]}}''—Japanese comics and cartooning—have developed narratives connecting the art form to pre-20th-century Japanese art.  Particular emphasis falls on the ''Hokusai Manga'' as a precursor, though Hokusai's book is not narrative, nor does the term ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' originate with Hokusai.{{sfn|Stewart|2014|pp=28–29}}  In English and other languages the word ''{{transl|ja|manga}}'' is used in the restrictive sense of "Japanese comics" or "Japanese-style comics",{{sfn|Stewart|2014|p=30}} while in Japanese it indicates all forms of comics, cartooning,{{sfn|Johnson-Woods|2010|p=336}} and caricature.{{sfn|Morita|2010|p=33}}

==Collection and preservation==

The ruling classes strictly limited the space permitted for the homes of the lower social classes; the relatively small size of ukiyo-e works was ideal for hanging in these homes.{{sfn|Bell|2004|pp=140, 175}}  Little record of the patrons of ukiyo-e paintings has survived.  They sold for considerably higher prices than prints—up to many thousands of times more, and thus must have been purchased by the wealthy, likely merchants and perhaps some from the samurai class.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=137}}  Late-era prints are the most numerous extant examples, as they were produced in the greatest quantities in the 19th century, and the older a print is the less chance it had of surviving.{{sfn|Kita|2011|p=149}}  Ukiyo-e was largely associated with Edo, and visitors to Edo often bought what they called ''azuma-e''{{efn|{{nihongo||東絵|azuma-e}} "pictures of the Eastern capital"}} ("pictures of the Eastern capital") as souvenirs.  Shops that sold them might specialize in products such as hand-held fans, or offer a diverse selection.{{sfn|Marks|2012|p=10}}

The ukiyo-e print market was highly diversified as it sold to a heterogeneous public, from dayworkers to wealthy merchants.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=140}}  Little concrete is known about production and consumption habits.  Detailed records in Edo were kept of a wide variety of courtesans, actors, and sumo wrestlers, but no such records pertaining to ukiyo-e remain—or perhaps ever existed.  Determining what is understood about the demographics of ukiyo-e consumption has required indirect means.{{sfn|Hockley|2003|pp=7–8}}

Determining at what prices prints sold is a challenge for experts, as records of hard figures are scanty and there was great variety in the production quality, size,{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|p=216}} supply and demand,{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=31}} and methods, which went through changes such as the introduction of full-colour printing.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=32}}  How expensive prices can be considered is also difficult to determine as social and economic conditions were in flux throughout the period.{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|pp=216—217}}  In the 19th century, records survive of prints selling from as low as 16 ''{{transl|ja|[[Japanese mon (currency)|mon]]}}''{{sfn|Ōkubo|2008|pp=151—153}} to 100 ''{{transl|ja|mon}}'' for deluxe editions.{{sfn|Kobayashi|Ōkubo|1994|p=217}}  Jun'ichi Ōkubo suggests that prices in the 20s and 30s of ''{{transl|ja|mon}}'' were likely common for standard prints.{{sfn|Ōkubo|2013|p=43}}  As a loose comparison, a bowl of [[soba]] noodles in the early 19th century typically sold for 16 ''mon''.{{sfnm|1a1=Kobayashi|1a2=Ōkubo|1y=1994|1p=217|2a1=Bell|2y=2004|2p=174}}

[[File:Ichiyōsai Yoshitaki pre-fade post-fade.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Colour print illustration of a Japanese woman crouching.  The image combines two photos of the same image.  The right side of the photo is faded.|Ukiyo-e prints are sensitive to light.  The left half shows this print in 1989, the right shows the same print after being on display until 2001.&lt;br/&gt;[[Utagawa Yoshitaki]], 19th century]]

The dyes in ukiyo-e prints are susceptible to fading when exposed even to low levels of light; this makes long-term display undesirable.  The paper they are printed on deteriorates when it comes in contact with [[acid]]ic materials, so storage boxes, folders, and mounts must be of neutral pH or [[Alkalinity|alkaline]].  Prints should be regularly inspected for problems needing treatment, and stored at a [[relative humidity]] of 70% or less to prevent fungal discolourations.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999–2001}}

The paper and pigments in ukiyo-e paintings are sensitive to light and seasonal changes in humidity.  Mounts must be flexible, as the sheets can tear under sharp changes in humidity.  In the Edo era, the sheets were mounted on long-fibred paper and preserved scrolled up in plain [[Paulownia tomentosa|paulownia]] boxes placed in another lacquer wooden box.{{sfn|Fleming|1985|p=61}}  In museum settings display times must be limited to prevent deterioration from exposure to light and environmental pollution.  Scrolling causes concavities in the paper, and the unrolling and rerolling of the scrolls causes creasing.{{sfn|Fleming|1985|p=75}}  Ideal relative humidity for scrolls should be kept between 50% and 60%; brittleness results from too dry a level.{{sfn|Toishi|1979|p=25}}

Because ukiyo-e prints were mass-produced, collecting them presents considerations different from the collecting of paintings.  There is wide variation in the condition, rarity, cost, and quality of extant prints.  Prints may have stains, [[foxing]], wormholes, tears, creases, or dogmarks, the colours may have faded, or they may have been retouched.  Carvers may have altered the colours or composition of prints that went through multiple editions.  When cut after printing, the paper may have been trimmed within the margin.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=180, 183–184}}  Values of prints depend on a variety of factors, including the artist's reputation, print condition, rarity, and whether it is an original pressing—even high-quality later printings will fetch a fraction of the valuation of an original.{{sfn|Fiorillo|2001–2002a}}  As of 2016, the record price for an ukiyo-e print sold at auction was {{€|link=yes}}{{val|745000}} for Utamaro's ''[[Fukaku Shinobu Koi]]'' ({{circa|1793–94}}).{{sfn|AFP–Jiji staff|2016}}

Ukiyo-e prints often went through multiple editions, sometimes with changes made to the blocks in later editions.  Editions made from recut woodblocks also circulate, such as legitimate later reproductions, as well as pirate editions and other fakes.{{sfn|Fiorillo|1999–2005}}  Takamizawa Enji (1870–1927), a producer of ukiyo-e reproductions, developed a method of recutting woodblocks to print fresh colour on faded originals, over which he used tobacco ash to make the fresh ink seem aged.  These refreshed prints he resold as original printings.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=36}}  Amongst the defrauded collectors was American architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who brought {{val|1500}} Takamizawa prints with him from Japan to the US, some of which he had sold before the truth was discovered.{{sfn|Fiorillo|2001–2002b}}

Ukiyo-e artists are referred to in the Japanese style, the surname preceding the personal name, and well-known artists such as Utamaro and Hokusai by personal name alone.{{sfn|Lane|1962|p=313}}  Dealers normally refer to ukiyo-e prints by the names of [[Woodblock printing in Japan#Print sizes|the standard sizes]], most commonly the {{convert|34.5|x|22.5|cm|in|adj=on}} ''aiban'', the {{convert|22.5|x|19|cm|in|adj=on}} ''chūban'', and the {{convert|38|x|23|cm|in|adj=on}} ''ōban''{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=31}}—precise sizes vary, and paper was often trimmed after printing.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=40}}

Many of the largest high-quality collections of ukiyo-e lie outside Japan.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=13}}  Examples entered the collection of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]] in the first half of the 19th century.  The [[British Museum]] began a collection in 1860{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=38}} that by the late 20th century numbered {{val|70000}} items.{{sfn|Merritt|1990|pp=13–14}}  The largest, surpassing {{val|100000}} items, resides in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],{{sfn|Merritt|1990|p=13}} begun when Ernest Fenollosa donated his collection in 1912.{{sfn|Bell|2004|p=39}}  The first exhibition in Japan of ukiyo-e prints was likely one presented by [[Kōjirō Matsukata]] in 1925, who amassed his collection in Paris during World War&amp;nbsp;I and later donated it to the [[National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo]].{{sfn|Checkland|2004|p=107}}  The largest collection of ukiyo-e in Japan is the {{val|100000}} pieces in the [[Japan Ukiyo-e Museum]] in the [[Matsumoto, Nagano|city of Matsumoto]].{{sfn|Garson|2001|p=14}}
