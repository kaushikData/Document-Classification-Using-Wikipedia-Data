The extension '''.green''' is a generic Top Level Domain ([[gTLD]]). The Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) delegated the .green extension to the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) on June 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Delegated Strings &amp;#124; ICANN New gTLDs &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHapA90I?url=http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The .green gTLD is used by individuals, communities, industries and [[environmental organization]]s showcasing their position in the green movement.  .green websites support the spread of green awareness and information around the world. The .green TLD and those who use it promote the green economy, innovation and conservation. The organization donates a percentage of all sales and renewals of .green domain names to The DotGreen Foundation for the purpose of funding environmental [[sustainability]] projects for organizations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daedulus |first=Cheyla |url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2009/07/30/dot-eco-domain-faces-competition-from-dot-green/ |title=Dot Eco Domain Faces Competition From Dot Green |publisher=Ecorazzi |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information ==
'''.green''' domain name registrations became available March 24, 2015&lt;ref name="going.green"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150201111714/http://www.going.green/launch-schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/announcements-and-media/announcement-28feb14-en |title=New Contracting Statistics Released |publisher=ICANN |date=2014-02-28 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Nic.green/ went live at the end of 2014 and was the first ever .green website.  DotGreen's main and current website, http://www.going.green/ went live January 26, 2015  .green domain names can be purchased at most online registrars around the world just like .com and .org.

==World's environmental top level domain ==
The '''.green''' new Top Level Domain is under the stewardship of the DotGreen Community, Inc., which was formed for the purpose of bringing .green to the Internet through the New gTLD Program with the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN.  DotGreen is a SF Bay Area company that works closely with one of the largest Registry Operators in the world, Afilias Limited in Dublin, Ireland.

In an article titled 5 ways Brands should be using new gTLDs, the author writes, "brand owners should survey the entire space of new TLDs on a consistent basis to make sure that they register and use domains in meaningful spaces to connect with consumers. For example, a company like Patagonia should consider the idea of owning the domain www.patagonia.green. The brand could use the site to highlight its work in the "green" community. Additionally, Patagonia will be able to leverage the work that the .green gTLD is doing to connect with that community and make it a known quantity amongst consumers who want to support "green" initiatives." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=5 ways brands should be using gTLDs - iMediaConnection.com &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/34234.asp#PdgsRZdH7r5gpiZq.99 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHastHVK?url=http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/34234.asp#PdgsRZdH7r5gpiZq.99 |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Long history to bring .green to the internet ==
The .green initiative began in 2007 after the Generic Names Supporting Organization, known as the GNSO completed the policy discussion about new gTLDs at the ICANN meeting in Los Angeles, 2007. (Aside from .Berlin proposed during an earlier round) .green was the first of what later became 1409 gTLDs and amounted to the greatest domain name expansion of the Internet since its inception.  .green is the world's first environmental TLD proposed to both Internet and Environmental communities. It was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area by a member of the green movement, a stay at home mother with four children.  The .green initiative was originally built around a California not for profit organization called The DotGreen Foundation, established for this purpose by Ms. Annalisa Roger in 2007,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dotgreen.org/about-us/|title = About us|publisher = Dotgreen|date = |accessdate = 2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated in 2008 as a Public Benefit Charity with [[501(c) organization|U.S. 501 (c)3]] Tax Exempt Status. It was unknown if and when the new gTLD Program would be written, approved, and implemented.

Paris, France, June 2008, ICANN announced the new gTLD Program and .green was at the forefront.   At that time, the effort behind .green was run by volunteers as a not-for-profit initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2009/07/30/dot-eco-domain-faces-competition-from-dot-green/ |title=Dot Eco Domain Faces Competition From Dot Green |website=Ecorazzi.com |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new group appeared with a second environmental Top Level Domain thought to be competition for .green.  Later, an interesting reveal was discovered that the .eco group was backed by Al Gore and Sir Roger Moore.  However, the .eco TLD soon became contentious when as many as three parties were interested in developing the .eco top-level domain as a for profit business.  The volunteers behind DotGreen established a website and traveled internationally following ICANN meetings to spread awareness, growing support for .green from environmental, humanitarian, and Internet communities.

2009, DotGreen contracted with Neustar for Registry Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dotgreen-selects-neustar-to-provide-registry-and-dns-support-to-green-tld-60632402.html |title=DotGreen Selects Neustar to Provide Registry and DNS Support to .green TLD |website=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with EarthShare for global distribution of funds earned through .green domain name sales. The volunteer effort behind DotGreen was funded by two women, Annalisa Roger and another local mom, Ms. Jennifer Knoll. Their team participated at ICANN for three years working with the Internet community to forward the new gTLD program.   It became necessary to find additional funding to support their team and for the .green initiative to survive the long, unknown timeline of ICANN's new gTLD program.  In 2011, The DotGreen Community, Inc. a private corporation, was co-founded by DotGreen Foundation's Director, Annalisa Roger, Jennifer Knoll, joined by a local investor, Mr. Jeremy Coon who offered to raise investor funding.  DotGreen Community, Inc. formed a partnership with the existing DotGreen Foundation and submitted the application to ICANN. According to Roger, the proposed gTLD stands for "Global Response to Environmental and Economic Necessities" (.GREEN).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  June 6, 2012, Singapore, Competition for .green surfaced at ICANN's Big Reveal when three Internet veterans positioned themselves at the last minute as .green applicants.  All three had filed applications for large portfolios of other new gTLDs with ICANN.

== Competition ==
DotGreen Community, Inc., its supporters, and the global green community exercised all options within the framework of the new gTLD applicant guidebook program during every stage of ICANN's multi-stakeholder program over the following year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DotGreen Is No More &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20131012_dotgreen_is_no_more/ |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHaprFRn?url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20131012_dotgreen_is_no_more/ |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This included an outpouring of public support where notable individuals and organizations posted fifty online comments and letters to the ICANN Public Comments Forum website, and wrote letters to both ICANN and the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) insisting that DotGreen Community gain the delegation of .green over the other applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ICANN's Application Comments and Program Feedback - View Comments &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=https://gtldcomment.icann.org/comments-feedback/applicationcomment/viewcomments |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHauaVgs?url=https://gtldcomment.icann.org/comments-feedback/applicationcomment/viewcomments |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No other .green applicant  received a letter in favor of their .green applications.

The Czech Republic, a member of the Government Advisory Committee [GAC] wrote a letter to the ICANN Board in favor of DotGreen and issued a GAC Warning (an official part of the new gTLD program) stating: "This early warning is for three applications for the string .green, they are: Top Level Domain Holdings Limited, United TLD Holdco, and Afilias Ltd. This early warning is based on concerns that these 3 applications are not directly involved or focused on the Global Public Benefit of the .green string."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Search - ICANN GAC &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=https://gacweb.icann.org/dosearchsite.action?queryString=.green |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHaySjIz?url=https://gacweb.icann.org/dosearchsite.action?queryString=.green |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ICANN Board did not respond to this GAC Early Warning nor the many pleas for public benefit posted in ICANN's online Public Forum.  There were no GAC warnings issued to DotGreen Community's application.

The publicly traded companies, [[Top Level Domain Holdings Ltd.]] and Demand Media's affiliate known as [[United TLD Holdco Ltd.]] later traded under the name, Rightside and a third privately held Irish corporation, Afilias Limited planned a private auction to determine by way of the highest bidder, which one would gain the rights to manage the .green gTLD.  Top Level Domain Holdings Limited (operating as Minds + Machines) was the well funded group seeking the .eco domain.

== DotGreen Community, Inc. withdrew ==
DotGreen withdrew its application from ICANN for the .green gTLD in October 2013.&lt;ref name="ipmirror"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipmirror.com/new-gtld/dotgreen-registry-quits |title=Latest News on New gTLDs - All articles |website=Ipmirror.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled, "DotGreen calls it quits with “impossible” gTLD auction looming" the author writes, "It seems the final decision was financial — the cost of delays and an auction too much for the start-up to bear. It’s a pity really — there was some genuine enthusiasm for the cause behind this bid." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DotGreen calls it quits with &amp;#8220;impossible&amp;#8221; gTLD auction looming &amp;#124; DomainIncite - Domain Name Industry News, Analysis &amp;amp; Opinion &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://domainincite.com/14695-dotgreen-calls-it-quits-with-impossible-gtld-auction-looming |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHaxGkAE?url=http://domainincite.com/14695-dotgreen-calls-it-quits-with-impossible-gtld-auction-looming |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter, the Founder of .green wrote to the community she said, "...the auction procedure [allowed by ICANN] disregarded DotGreen's long history in the green community, and ignored the authenticity of DotGreen's application, and the importance of public benefit which is in both the policies of the new gTLD program and stated in ICANN's bylaws." &lt;ref&gt;collaborative nature of the green movement&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloggers described the withdrawal as disappointing.  The announcement came months before the fate of the .green TLD would be decided via ICANN’s auction process that saw companies with very deep pockets including Demand Media (Rightside), TLDH (Minds+Machines) and Afilias all vying to become the official .green registry.&lt;ref name="nametalent6231"&gt;{{cite web |title=DotGreen Community Inc. &amp;amp; Afilias Partnership Best gTLD Story of the Year &amp;#124; NameTalent.com &amp;#8211; Domain Name Publication &amp;#8211; Domain Sales, Strategy, Trends, Analysis and Happenings &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://nametalent.com/blog/?p=6231 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHavPqbf?url=http://nametalent.com/blog/?p=6231 |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== .green environmental TLD auctioned to highest bidder ==
February 2014, "The industry headline was, Two more new gTLDs — .wedding and .green — were auctioned off, with proceeds amounting to millions of dollars."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=.wedding and .green gTLD auctions raise millions &amp;#124; DomainIncite - Domain Name Industry News, Analysis &amp;amp; Opinion &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://domainincite.com/15896-wedding-and-green-gtld-auctions-raise-millions |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHawU3ot?url=http://domainincite.com/15896-wedding-and-green-gtld-auctions-raise-millions |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afilias stood as the lone and winning applicant for .green (to go along with their other color TLDs .black, .blue, .pink, .red).&lt;ref name="nametalent6231"/&gt;

== DotGreen Community, Inc. rises from the ashes ==
On Sept. 16, 2014 almost one year after DotGreen withdrew from the race, DotGreen Community, Inc. and Afilias announced a contracted relationship to bring the world's first gTLD for the growing green economy, businesses, social and environmental initiatives to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150201141707/http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/2014/09/16/PH12671 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry responded to the news with articles and headlines: DotGreen Community Inc. &amp; Afilias Partnership Best gTLD Story of the Year &lt;ref name="nametalent6231"/&gt; and DotGreen Rises From the Ashes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DotGreen Rises From the Ashes &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://www.internetnews.me/2014/09/16/dotgreen-rises-ashes/ |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHaqMY1X?url=http://www.internetnews.me/2014/09/16/dotgreen-rises-ashes/ |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and DotGreen is back from the dead &lt;ref name="domainincite1"&gt;{{cite web |title=DotGreen is back from the dead &amp;#124; DomainIncite - Domain Name Industry News, Analysis &amp;amp; Opinion &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://domainincite.com/17346-dotgreen-is-back-from-the-dead |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XHarp8HV?url=http://domainincite.com/17346-dotgreen-is-back-from-the-dead |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry blogger, Kevin Murphy wrote, "It appears to be a unique, first-of-its-kind relationship in the new gTLD space...Afilias will run the technical infrastructure of the registry, but the heavy-lifting of actually marketing the names falls on DotGreen...Given that DotGreen spent quite a lot of time in the run-up to the new gTLD application process building relationships with environmental groups, this could be an incredibly shrewd move by Afilias." &lt;ref name="domainincite1"/&gt;

==Alternative DNS roots==
A .green gTLD bearing no connection to the above is supported in the [[alternative DNS root]] [[Name.Space]].

The '''2013 Anti–Sri Lanka protests''' are a series of [[student protest]]s and agitations initiated by the [[Students Federation for Freedom of Tamil Eelam]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], against war crimes committed against [[Sri Lankan Tamil people]] by [[Sri Lankan army]] during the [[Eelam War IV]]. The protesters demanded that the [[Government of India]] vote in support of a [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC) resolution censuring the [[Government of Sri Lanka]] for [[war crimes]].&lt;ref name="toi _20130316"&gt;{{cite news|title=Students protest continues in Tamil Nadu to press Centre for UN resolution against Sri Lanka|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-16/india/37766450_1_students-protest-school-students-lankan-tamils-issue|date=16 March 2013|work=[[Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some radical groups even demanded the prosecution of the [[President of Sri Lanka]], [[Mahinda Rajapakse]] for his role in the alleged genocide of Sri Lankan Tamils. Apart from college students, doctors, film personalities and employees of IT companies also participated in the protests.&lt;ref name="thehindu_20130320"&gt;{{cite news|title=Techies swayed by anti-Sri Lanka stir|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/techies-swayed-by-antisri-lanka-stir/article4523008.ece?homepage=true|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From school to colleges mass number of students participated in protest. Students from other states lik who are studying in Tamil Nadu colleges too participated. Numerous protests, rallies held in marina beach which saw huge number of students. The anger and anguish of students turned against DMK and Congress which is the ruling party during 2009 Eelam war.   A statewide general strike declared on 12 March 2013 by the [[Tamil Eelam Supporters Organisation]] (TESO) evoked a mixed response with most of the political parties in the state keeping aloof alleging inaction on the part of the main participant [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) which was in power during the decisive stages of Eelam War IV.&lt;ref name="thehindu_20130313_1"&gt;{{cite news|title=General strike evokes mixed response|work=The Hindu|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/general-strike-evokes-mixed-response/article4503349.ece|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-parties-barring-vck-keep-away/article4503348.ece | title=All parties barring VCK keep away | work=The Hindu | date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student organisations called for statewide agitations on Monday, 18  March, forcing arts and science colleges in the state to close down for an indefinite period.&lt;ref name="thehindu_20130316"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arts colleges closed|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/arts-colleges-closed/article4514675.ece|work=The Hindu|date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As colleges and schools remained closed student groups organised protest through social media, Tamilandu people who themselves are sympathetic towards Sri Lankan Tamils sent their children to take part in the protests. As protests peaked in Tamil Nadu national and international media  provided good coverage. One remarkable effect of this protest is DMK chief Karuna fearing students outrage pulled out of congress alliance, On 19 March DMK chief announced withdrawal from UPA alliance citing Congress disregard to the suffering of Eelam Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/karunanidhi-clarifies-why-dmk-pulled-out-of-upa/article4529227.ece | title=Karunanidhi clarifies why DMK pulled out of UPA | date=20 March 2013 | newspaper=The Hindu | accessdate=8 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When DMK pulled out of UPA it was well received by DMK supporters. Congress was isolated in Tamilandu in 2014 general elections it contested in 40 seats alone and lost in all constituencies. But ironically  DMK formed alliance with congress again in May 2016 Tamil Nadu state elections showing its own colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/dmk-congress-alliance-sure-to-form-next-govt-in-tn-chidambaram/ | title=DMK-Congress alliance sure to form next govt in TN: Chidambaram | date=16 May 2016 | author=PTI | newspaper=The Indian Express | accessdate=8 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tamil Nadu Assembly Resolution==
The [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly|Tamil Nadu State Legislative Council]] passed legislation on 27 March 2013 urging the [[India|Indian Government]] to slap economic sanctions on [[Sri Lanka]] and demand for the formation of a separate [[Tamil Eelam|state]] for the [[Tamils of Sri Lanka]].

The resolution which was proposed by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[Jayalalitha]] was unanimously passed at the Assembly. The resolution was passed following the debate in the Council regarding the [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly|ongoing statewide students protests]] in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="Source 1"&gt;[http://onlineuthayan.com/english-news/uthayannews/x27403y2h1h1r2p2 Uthayan Referendum for separate Tamil Eelam. Resolution unanimously passed at Tamil Nadu Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Source 2"&gt;[http://www.tamilguardian.com/article.asp?articleid=7427 Tamil Guardian Tamil Nadu Assembly adopts resolution seeking Eelam referendum ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution demanded the formation of a separate [[Tamil Eelam|state]] in Sri Lanka, through the means of a referendum by a resolution at the UN Security Council which should be conducted among Tamils in Sri Lanka and other displaced Tamils across the world.&lt;ref name="Source 2"/&gt;

Moving the resolution, Jayalalithaa said the ongoing students protest was reflective of her government's initiative on the Sri Lankan issue even as she requested them to withdraw the stir and resume classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/news/tamil-nadu/tn-assembly-wants-india-to-move-unsc-resolution-against-lanka_838176.html Zee News TN Assembly demands referendum for separate Tamil Eelam ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution also called on the Indian Government to stop considering Sri Lanka as a 'friendly country' and impose economic sanctions, as well as calling for an international inquiry in "genocide and war crimes" against Sri Lankan Tamils.&lt;ref name="Source 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Source 2"/&gt;

== In United Kingdom ==
On 20 June 2013, during [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]] semi final match between India and Sri Lanka at the [[SWALEC Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], Tamil Eelam supporters invaded the pitch with the flags of the Tamil Eelam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-champions-trophy-2013/content/story/643955.html | title=Security breaches disrupt semi-final | publisher=espncricinfo.com | date=20 June 2013 | accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, at least 400 protesters held up the Sri Lankan team bus and raised anti-Sri Lankan government slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sports.ndtv.com/icc-champions-trophy-2013/news/209561-protesters-hold-up-sri-lankan-team-bus-after-supporters-invade-cardiff-pitch | title=Protesters hold up Sri Lankan team bus after supporters invade Cardiff pitch | publisher=NDTV | date=21 June 2013 | accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Al Bander report [Al Bandar]''' refers to an alleged political conspiracy by certain government officials in [[Bahrain]] to foment [[sectarian strife]] and marginalize the majority [[Shia]] community in the country. The conspiracy was allegedly led and financed by [[Ahmed bin Ateyatalla Al Khalifa]], Minister of Cabinet Affairs and head of the Civil Informatics Organization and member of the [[Al Khalifa]] royal family. The allegations were revealed in September 2006, in a 240-page document produced by the [[Gulf Centre for Democratic Development]], and authored by Dr [[Salah Al Bandar]], an adviser to the Cabinet Affairs Ministry. Following the distribution of the report, Bahraini police forcibly deported Dr Al Bandar to the United Kingdom, where he holds citizenship.

According to Dr Al Bander, the Minister in Bahrain paid five main operatives a total of more than $2.7 million to run:
* a secret intelligence cell spying on [[Shi’a]]s
* ‘[[GONGO]]s’ – government operated bogus NGOs like the ‘Bahraini Jurists Society’ and the ‘[[Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society]]’
* internet forums and websites that foment sectarian hatred
* subsidisation of ‘new converts’ from [[Shia]] Islamic sect to the [[Sunni]] sect
* payments for election rigging

'''Ambridge''' is a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania|Beaver County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. Incorporated in 1905 as a company town by the [[American Bridge Company]], Ambridge is located 16 miles (25&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of [[Pittsburgh]], along the [[Ohio River]]. The population was 7,050 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]].

==Early history==
The town is near the location of [[Legionville]], the training camp for General [[Anthony Wayne|"Mad" Anthony Wayne]]'s [[Legion of the United States]]. Wayne's was the first attempt to provide [[basic training]] for regular U.S. Army recruits and Legionville was the first facility established expressly for this purpose.

The [[Harmony Society]] first settled the area in the early 19th century, founding the village of "Ökonomie" or [[Old Economy Village|Economy]] in 1824. Although initially successful, accumulating significant landholdings, the sect went into decline.  By the end of the 19th century, only a few Harmonists remained.  The Society was dissolved and its vast real estate holdings sold, much of it to the [[American Bridge Company]], who subsequently enlarged the town and incorporated it as Ambridge in 1905.

==Industry==

American Bridge attracted thousands of immigrants who came to fulfill their dreams of work, freedom, and peace.  The steel mills became the focal point of the town.  Most of the employees were relatives of relatives and the small town grew, with wards separating the town into ethnic sections. In addition, many of the ethnicities had their own church, club, and musical group that sought to give immigrants a familiar place to be as well as to preserve their culture. Many were from Eastern and Southern Europe including Italian, Greek, Slovak, Croatian, Ukrainian, Polish, Slovene, and Carpartho-Rusyn to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slater|first1=Larry|title=Ambridge(Images of America)|date=April 9, 2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=0738554863|url=https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/9780738554860/Ambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christ The King church|url=http://diopitt.org/parishes/christ-king-ambridge|website=Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy Trinity Ambridge|url=http://diopitt.org/parishes/holy-trinity-ambridge|website=Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divine Redeemer Ambridge|url=http://diopitt.org/parishes/divine-redeemer-ambridge|website=Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Stanislaus, Ambridge|url=http://diopitt.org/parishes/saint-stanislaus-ambridge|website=Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church|url=http://www.htgoc.org/about-us/history-of-our-parish/|website=Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church of Ambridge|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy Ghost Orthodox Church, Ambridge, Pennsylvania|url=http://www.holyghostoca.org/orthodoxy.html|website=Holy Ghost Orthodox Church, Ambridge|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growth of the steel mills, Ambridge became a worldwide leader in steel production.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  The borough became known for bridge building, metal molding, and the manufacture of tubes (large iron pipes).  During [[World War II]], the American Bridge Company fabricated steel for the building of LSTs (Landing Ship Tanks). The steel was then sent by rail to the adjacent American Bridge naval shipyard in [[Leetsdale, Pennsylvania|Leetsdale]], PA where the LSTs were built. The area was also home to several other steel mills like Armco, the pipe mill which manufactured oil piping, and A.M. Byers, a major iron and tool fabricator.  Eventually competition by foreign steel producers began to cause the share of the steel market for U.S. manufacturers to dwindle. With the shift of steel production overseas, the American Bridge Company ended operations in Ambridge in 1983.  The legacy of American Bridge can be seen today in [[American Bridge Company|bridges]] around the world.

The decline of both the steel industry and the town in chronicled in ''Rust Belt Boy'' by Ambridge native [[Paul Hertneky]].&lt;ref name="BeheGrowingUp"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Behe|first1=Rege|title=Writer chronicles growing up in '60s Ambridge|url=http://triblive.com/aande/books/10466889-74/hertneky-ambridge-belt|accessdate=June 1, 2016|publisher=Pittsburgh Tribune Review|date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current day==
Even though the steel mills no longer dominate the landscape, Ambridge remains the home of [[Old Economy Village]], a [[National Historic Landmark]] administered by the [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]].  The site interprets the [[Harmony Society]], one of America's most successful 19th century Christian [[Commune (intentional community)|communal]] societies.  Old Economy Village also provides public education and preservation of the Society's unique material culture.  Founded by [[George Rapp]], it was the third and final location of the Harmonites.  Established in 1824, Old Economy - known to the Harmonites as "Ökonomie" - was founded upon German [[Pietism]], which called for a higher level of purity within [[Christianity]].  Soon the Harmonites were not only known for their piety, but also for their production of wool, cotton, and silk.  As a pioneer in the American silk industry, Economy became known as the American silk center in the 1830s and 1840s.  Today, the site maintains seventeen carefully restored structures and gardens that were built between 1824 and 1830.  The buildings reflect the unusual life style of the organization, which, by the 1840s, was well renowned for its economic success in textile production.  The site also portrays the community's involvement with agricultural production, railroads, and oil.  The recreated gardens encompass more than {{convert|2|acre|m2}}, providing colorful 19th century flowers.  The gardens' formal pathways, stone pavilion, and seasonal flowering hedges are among the striking features.  Old Economy's buildings, grounds, library, archives and 16,000 original artifacts are fused to create an interpretive facility for the Commonwealth.

Although the different ethnic groups of Ambridge have blended over time, the community continues to recognize the origins from which it came.  Since 1966, Ambridge has held an annual heritage festival celebrating the borough's ethnic pride.  Diversity in food, music, and entertainment continues to unite the community in remembering its origins.  Organized by the Ambridge Chamber of Commerce, the three-day Nationality Days festival takes place in May and is located in the heart of the downtown Commercial District.  Vendors line the center of Merchant Street as thousands of attendees – locals and tourists – enjoy Italian, Ukrainian, Greek, Polish, German, Croatian, and Slovenian cuisine.  Booths are sponsored by numerous churches in Ambridge, bringing with them the recipes for their cultural dishes such as pirohy, haluski, stuffed cabbage, and borscht.  Live entertainment, arts and crafts, and children's activities are also available. Thousands visit this festival daily (located on Merchant Street from 4th Street to 8th Street).

With Ambridge now over 100 years old, revitalization is beginning to occur along Merchant Street in the Downtown Commercial District.  Entrepreneurs and investors have begun to renovate the Victorian facades of the commercial storefronts.  [[Antique shop]]s are opening in the Historic District, which is also a National Historic Landmark, and a once industrial warehouse area is being converted to condominiums, shops, and parks.  In 2007 Ambridge was designated as a Preserve America Community by the White House.  Convenient to Pittsburgh along the Ohio River Boulevard and just across the Ohio River from the Pittsburgh Airport, Ambridge leaders hope it will benefit by its location and low cost of living.

== Background ==
{{main|Cursed soldiers}}

In the aftermath of the joint [[German invasion of Poland|German]]-[[Soviet invasion of Poland]], the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish government evacuated to the West]] and created the [[Polish Underground State]]. While no war was declared between Poland and the Soviet Union, the relations were tense, and eventually broke down in 1943 in the aftermath of the revelations of the [[Katyn massacre]]. The Soviets eventually created their own Polish communist puppet government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (''Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego'', ''PKWN'') and refused to deal with the Underground State just like they refused to deal with the government-in-exile; its leaders and soldiers on "liberated" Polish territories were persecuted.&lt;ref name="Rzecz"&gt;[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]], 02.10.04 Nr 232, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20140910065136/http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_041002/specjal_a_6.html Wielkie polowanie: Prześladowania akowców w Polsce Ludowej]'' (Great hunt: the persecutions of AK soldiers in the People's Republic of Poland).

As late as the 1980s, the last decade of the People's Republic of Poland, government representative [[Jerzy Urban]] declared that the Polish government had "no evidence to support the theory that a group of Polish citizens disappeared in the Augustów region in 1945."&lt;ref name=IPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=wywiad/&gt; After the [[fall of communism]], the new Polish government supported the investigation, carried out by the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN), which classified it as a [[communist crime]].&lt;ref name=np/&gt; While it is commonly accepted that the Soviet Union, backed by communist Polish forces, arrested and likely executed approximately 600 Polish citizens connected to the anti-communist resistance, no conclusive information on their exact fate and resting place has yet been found.&lt;ref name=IPN/&gt; In 1995 the Russian government confirmed that 590 Polish citizens were arrested and 579 were put on trial, but that there is no information on their subsequent fate.&lt;ref name=gdzie/&gt;&lt;ref name=wywiad/&gt; In 2005 IPN noted that the research possibilities on Polish territory had been exhausted; even the archives of Polish secret services involved in the operations were analysed but contained only cursory information that they were aiding the Soviets without being given much information.&lt;ref name=wywiad/&gt; However, Polish requests to the Russian government for support in the investigation were not productive, and many have been ignored.&lt;ref name=IPN/&gt; A symbolic monument has been built in the village of [[Giby]], where a mass grave was found (these were later proven to belong to German soldiers from a nearby field hospital).&lt;ref name=np/&gt;&lt;ref name=gdzie/&gt;

'''Bookland''' ({{lang-ang|bocland}}) was a type of land tenure under [[Anglo-Saxon law]] and referred to land that was vested by a [[Anglo-Saxon Charters|charter]]. Land held without a charter was known as ''folkland'' ({{lang-ang|folcland}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Baxter|2005|p=19}} ''A Model of Land Tenure''&lt;/ref&gt;

The meanings of these terms have more depth when their [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] origins are considered. The concept of bookland arose in the seventh century and referred to land that could be 'alienated' (i.e., disposed of) at will. It evolved to resemble ownership in the modern sense. Folkland was land held under ancient, unwritten folk-law or custom and by that custom it could not be alienated (i.e., removed) from the kin of the holder, except under special circumstances. No such claim by the kin could be made on bookland. The definition of those ancient folk-laws and customs, and the definition of the word ''folkland'', has long been the subject of controversy. The model suggested by the historian [[Patrick Wormald]], given in the definition above, allows for the graceful sidestepping of that controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Baxter|2008|p=145}} ''Land''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept was ''loanland'' ({{lang-ang|lænland}}), which was land granted temporarily, without any loss of ownership. Such land might be granted for a term of years, or for the life of a person, or it might be granted to an official for the term of his office (e.g., as royal patronage). Both folkland and bookland might become loanland at one time or another.

== Historical background ==
By ancient law and custom, folkland was the only means of holding land in Anglo-Saxon England, and referred to land held by a single person as the representative of a kinship group. Land could be permanently transferred outside of the kinship group, or "alienated", but only with the agreement of the [[king]] and the [[witanagemot]]. Failing that, land could be transferred only within the kinship group, for example through inheritance.

However, the exact nature of these unwritten ancient customs is not clearly understood, and might include several different types of land tenure, such as kinship holdings intended to remain within the kinship, or holdings of the king to be granted as rewards for service, or holdings of the people as a whole (the "folk") to be granted in their name by the king, or any combination of these.

The concept of bookland entered Anglo-Saxon law in the seventh century via the influence of the late [[Roman Empire]]'s Vulgar Law,&lt;ref&gt;See Eric John's ''Land Tenure in Early England'' (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to land that was granted in perpetuity by a [[Anglo-Saxon Charters|charter]], and thereafter could be conveyed from anyone to anyone else at will. This was its only practical distinction from "folkland".

The altering of the law to add this concept had its origins in the [[christianisation]] of the Anglo-Saxons in the seventh century. As neither the [[Roman Catholic Church#Early Middle Ages|Church]] nor its clergy could be fitted into the existing laws of land tenure, Anglo-Saxon law added the granting of charters as a means of supporting them. It had been intended as a permanent grant of land for landowners building religious establishments, with the stipulation that the holder must perform road and bridge upkeep and supply men for the [[Leidang|fyrd]].  Though there is evidence that this was not the first charter to be written in Anglo-Saxon England, the earliest surviving genuine charter, in favour of the abbot and monastery at [[St Mary's Church, Reculver|Reculver]], in [[Kent]], was granted by [[Hlothere|King Hlothere of Kent]] in May 679.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aschart.kcl.ac.uk/content/charters/text/s0008.html Online text of charter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720083511/http://www.aschart.kcl.ac.uk/content/charters/text/s0008.html |date=July 20, 2007 }}. See also [[Leslie E. Webster|Webster, L.]] &amp; [[Janet Backhouse|Backhouse, J.]] (eds.), ''The Making of England Anglo-Saxon Art and Culture AD 600-900'', British Museum Press, 1991, pp. 43-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The desirability of possessing unencumbered "bookland" in preference to "folkland" must have been immediately apparent to the laity, as [[Bede]] complained in a letter to [[Ecgbert, Archbishop of York|Archbishop Ecgbert of York]] in 731, regarding the vast tracts of land acquired by "pretended monks" whose licentious interests were anything but Christian. To begin with, church land under bookright was exempt from taxation and immune from the ''trimodia necessitas'', that is, the upkeep of bridges and fortifications on the land, and the provision of military service, or [[fyrd]].&lt;ref&gt;E. John, ''Land Tenure in Early England''(1960)&lt;/ref&gt; These immunities were removed from church land by the end of the 8th century, perhaps in response to the situation of which [[Bede]] complains.

As Anglo-Saxon law evolved, the religious requirement atrophied and was finally discarded, so that bookland resembled full ownership in the modern sense, in that the owner could grant it in his lifetime, in the same manner as he had received it, by ''boc'' or book, and also dispose of it by will.

== The end of Anglo-Saxon law ==
The nature of Anglo-Saxon land tenure was substantially changed by the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, as all land was then held by the King under [[Normans|Norman]] [[feudalism|feudal]] control. The King's tenants in chief held their land in return for provision of men at arms to the King. However, the changes in the nature of tenure were not absolute. Military service had been a duty of landholders before 1066 and some Anglo-Saxon law and custom continued to apply after the conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Williams, ''How Land was Held before and after the Norman conquest'' (in RWH Erskine and Ann Williams, ''The Story of Domesday Book'', Phillimore, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] does not mention folkland or bookland, but the form of tenure in January 1066 (TRE) is frequently given. Although a variety of wording is used. Ann Williams equates land held "freely" (libere) with bookland.

The laws regarding land tenure continued to evolve after the conquest, and there was no return to pre-Norman law and custom. Thus, the distinction between folkland and bookland is of historical interest, but without a substantive modern impact. However, the legacy of the pre-Norman Anglo-Saxon kingdoms is certainly of interest to those of Anglo-Saxon heritage, and to scholars attempting to construct histories and attempting to provide a full legal provenance for modern English law.

As few ancient records have survived, constructed histories are necessarily conjectural, with much room for disagreement. This accounts for the tautological definition: it represents an effort to be accurate while sidestepping any and all ongoing disputes regarding ancient Anglo-Saxon law and custom.

== Controversies over folkland ==
The exact meaning of the term folkland has been the subject of considerable controversy. However, the definition of bookland has suffered from less uncertainty, as its inception is within recorded history, with numerous examples available in the records.

Ignoring any prior conjectures, the idea that folkland was land owned by the entire folk was introduced by [[John Allen (historian)|John Allen]] in his 1830 ''Inquiry into the Rise and Growth of the Royal Prerogative in England''. He asserted that the land was the property of the people as a whole, to be let out at will, and returned to the people's control when the grant had expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Allen|1830|pp=135–36}} ''Tenure of Landed Property''&lt;/ref&gt; This became the accepted view of mainstream historians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Vinogradoff|1893|pp=1–2}} ''Folkland''. A lengthy list of respected historians and jurists is provided, and others are mentioned in the course of the article, including internationals. Allen's view had attracted very wide support.&lt;/ref&gt; who then developed arguments and theories based on the correctness of the proposition.

In a short article in ''The English Historical Review'' of 1893, [[Paul Vinogradoff]] asserted that folkland referred to land governed by folklaw or custom. It was this law that kept land within a family or kinship group, and folkland was not land collectively owned by the folk. He said that such land was held by a single representative of a kinship group, and that such land could not be alienated from (i.e., transferred from) the kinship group without special permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Vinogradoff|1893|pp=1–17}} ''Folkland''.&lt;/ref&gt; Vinogradoff then proceeded to show that his assertion was everywhere consistent with the historical record and nowhere inconsistent, pointing out along the way that neither the "accepted view" nor its derivatives satisfied the criterion of historical consistency.

While the idea of folkland as the common land of the folk was effectively put to rest for some, others persisted in their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Stubbs|1901|pp=74–132}} ''The Anglo-Saxon System'', for example.&lt;/ref&gt; Vinogradoff's own assertion did not go unchallenged, even by those who agreed with the thrust of his argument. Some, such as [[Frederic William Maitland|Frederic Maitland]], gave partial or cautious support,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Maitland|1897|pp=244–58}} ''Book-land and Folk-land''&lt;/ref&gt; while others rejected the assertion and offered their own definitions.

A more recent text dealing explicitly with these controversies is Eric John's 1960 work, ''Land Tenure in Early England''.&lt;ref&gt;E. John, Land Tenure in Early England (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; He emphatically denies the previously held view that bookland evolved to take the land out of the family line, and in fact developed specifically to keep it within the family, claiming that the king's power over folkland remained too powerful and that his favour depended too much on a subject's good behaviour towards him. An episode from [[Beowulf]] is employed to indicate that a subject who displeased the king was likely to have his folkland removed. Bookland, by contrast, provided the holder more definite powers of bequest removed from royal influence.

As there are only three explicit references to folkland in surviving documents, few plausible definitions can be ruled out, so long as they satisfy the criterion of historical consistency. The tautological definition sidesteps the controversy: it is agreed that all land that is not bookland is folkland. Ros Faith describes folkland as "the counterpart or antithesis of bookland".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Rosamund|last=Faith|title=The English peasantry and the growth of lordship|page=89|publisher=Leicester University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-7185-0011-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brusseline''' is a custom [[typeface]] developed in 2006 by [[Eric de Berranger]] for the signage of the [[Brussels Metro|Brussels public transport network]] (STIB-MIVB) managing metro, pre-metro and trams. The typeface started being used on the network in 2007 as part of company image campaign. The name is inspired by [[Parisine]], the typeface of Paris’ public transport network.

[[File:coaltub.png|right|frame|A succession of laws on child labour, the so-called [[Factory Acts]], were passed in the UK in the 19th century. Children younger than nine were not allowed to work, those aged 9–16 could work 16 hours per day per [[Cotton Mills, etc. Act 1819|Cotton Mills Act]]. In 1856, the law permitted child labour past age 9, for 60 hours per week, night or day.

'''Child labour''' refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives children of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child labour?|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=2012|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is considered exploitative by many [[international organisations]].

Child labour has existed to varying extents, through most of history. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many children aged 5–14 from poorer families still worked in Europe, the United States and various colonies of European powers. These children mainly worked in agriculture, home-based assembly operations, factories, mining and in services such as [[Newsboys Strike of 1899#Background|news boys]]. Some worked night shifts lasting 12 hours. With the rise of household income, availability of schools and passage of child labour laws, the incidence rates of child labour fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Labour in Historical Perspective: 1800-1985|publisher=UNICEF|author=Cunningham and Viazzo|isbn=88-85401-27-9|url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/hisper_childlabour_low.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ep99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Child Labour|author=Hugh Hindman|publisher=M.E.

Globally the incidence of child labour decreased from 25% to 10% between 1960 and 2003, according to the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Norberg, Johan (2007), ''[http://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/94943fabd8c9427492a71d6324e2d23a/varldens-valfard-fyra-decennier-som-forandrade-planeten Världens välfärd]'' (Stockholm: Government Offices of Sweden), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the total number of child labourers remains high, with [[UNICEF]] and [[ILO]] acknowledging an estimated 168 million children aged 5–17 worldwide, were involved in child labour in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To eliminate child labour, "attack it at its roots" UNICEF says|publisher=UNICEF|year=2013|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_70610.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Mill Children in Macon 2.jpg|thumb|Child labourers, [[Macon, Georgia]], 1909]]

===Child labour in preindustrial societies===
Child labour forms an intrinsic part of pre-industrial economies.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Diamond, J., The World Before Yesterday&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-industrial societies, there is rarely a concept of childhood in the modern sense. Children often begin to actively participate in activities such as child rearing, hunting and farming as soon as they are competent. In many societies, children as young as 13 are seen as adults and engage in the same activities as adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The work of children was important in pre-industrial societies, as children needed to provide their labour for their survival and that of their group. Pre-industrial societies were characterised by low productivity and short life expectancy, preventing children from participating in productive work would be more harmful to their welfare and that of their group in the long run. In pre-industrial societies, there was little need for children to attend school. This is especially the case in non literate societies. Most pre-industrial skill and knowledge were amenable to being passed down through direct mentoring or apprenticing by competent adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The Industrial Revolution===

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain in the late 18th century, there was a rapid increase in the industrial exploitation of labour, including child labour. Industrial cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool rapidly grew from small villages into large cities and improving [[child mortality]] rates. These cities drew in the population that was rapidly growing due to increased agricultural output.  This process was replicated in other industrialising counties.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The [[Victorian era]] in particular became notorious for the conditions under which children were employed.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Del Col, West Virginia University, [http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England]&lt;/ref&gt; Children as young as four were employed in production factories and mines working long hours in dangerous, often fatal, working conditions.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;E. P. Thompson ''The Making of the English Working Class'', (Penguin, 1968), pp. 366–7&lt;/ref&gt; In [[coal mine]]s, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Humphries, ''Childhood And Child Labour in the British Industrial Revolution'' (2010) p 33&lt;/ref&gt; Children also worked as errand boys, [[crossing sweeper]]s, shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods.&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt; Some children undertook work as [[apprentice]]s to respectable trades, such as building or as [[domestic servant]]s (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants worked 80-hour weeks.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Child labour played an important role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship. The children of the poor were expected to contribute to their family income.&lt;ref name="dan"&gt;Barbara Daniels, [http://www.hiddenlives.org.uk/articles/poverty.html Poverty and Families in the Victorian Era]&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a [[breadwinner]], as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered [[cotton mill]]s were described as children.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.galbithink.org/child.htm Child Labour and the Division of Labour in the Early English Cotton Mills]".&lt;/ref&gt; A high number of children also worked as [[prostitute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/hist8.html |title=Child Labour by Professor David Cody, Hartwick College |publisher=The Victorian Web|accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Charles Dickens]] worked at the age of 12 in a [[Blacking (polish)|blacking]] factory, with his family in [[debtor's prison]].&lt;ref name=Foster23&gt;{{harvnb|Forster|2006|pp=23–24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Child wages were often low; as little as 10–20% of an adult male's wage.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Galbi. Centre for History and Economics, King's College, Cambridge CB2 1ST.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] was an outspoken opponent of child labour,&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Part II:Proletariats and Communist and ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Part III&lt;/ref&gt; saying British industries, "could but live by sucking blood, and children’s blood too," and that U.S. capital was financed by the "capitalized blood of children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf|author=Mark Neocleous|title=THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE DEAD: MARX’S VAMPIRES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|author=Karl Marx|title=Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association|year=1864}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] castigated child labour in her 1835 poem ''The Factory'', portions of which she pointedly included in her 18th Birthday Tribute to Princess Victoria in 1837.

Throughout the second half of the 19th century, child labour began to decline in industrialised societies due to regulation and economic factors because of the Growth of [[Trade Unions]] . The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803. As early as 1802 and 1819 [[Factory Acts]] were passed to regulate the working hours of [[workhouse]] children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the "Short Time Committees" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in [[Factories Act 1847|1847]] limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] was an outspoken advocate of regulating child labour.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

As technology improved and proliferated, there was a greater need for educated employees. This saw an increase in schooling, with the eventual introduction of [[compulsory schooling]]. Improved technology and automation also made child labour redundant.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Early 20th century===

In the early 20th century, thousands of boys were employed in glass making industries. [[Glass production|Glass making]] was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133&amp;nbsp;°F). When the boys are at work, they are exposed to this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm to 3:00&amp;nbsp;am. Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hine|first=Russell Freedman ; with photographs by Lewis|title=Kids at work : Lewis Hine and the crusade against child labour|year=1994|publisher=Clarion Books|location=New York|isbn=0395587034|pages=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 1.7 million children under the age of fifteen were employed in American industry by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://webinstituteforteachers.org/%7Ebobfinn/2003/industrialrevolution.htm |title=The Industrial Revolution |publisher=Web Institute for Teachers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804084618/http://webinstituteforteachers.org/~bobfinn/2003/industrialrevolution.htm |archivedate=4 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, over 2 million children in the same age group were employed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hine-photos/ Photographs of Lewis Hine: Documentation of Child Labour]". The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;  This included children who rolled cigarettes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~arubin/HIST402_SP2007/87C1FBEB4AC722BB805B2CABD2BC32D4.html|title=Virginia:  Cigarette Rollers|website=userpages.umbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; engaged in factory work, worked as bobbin [[doffer]]s in textile mills, worked in coal mines and were employed in canneries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpages.umbc.edu/~arubin/HIST402_SP2007/9B72B3F098F81A13DAA017F591A2D33E.html Child Labour in the South: Essays and Links to photographs from the Lewis Hine Collection at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Hine]]'s photographs of child labourers in the 1910s powerfully evoked the plight of working children in the American south.  Hine took these photographs between 1908 and 1917 as the staff photographer for the [[National Child Labor Committee]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

====Household enterprises====
Factories and mines were not the only places where child labour was prevalent in the early 20th century. Home-based manufacturing across the United States and Europe employed children as well.&lt;ref name=ep99&gt;{{cite book|title=The Global Construction of Gender - Home based work in Political Economy of 20th Century|author=Elisabeth Prügl|pages=25–31, 50–59|isbn=978-0231115612|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governments and reformers argued that labour in factories must be regulated and the state had an obligation to provide welfare for poor. Legislation that followed had the effect of moving work out of factories into urban homes. Families and women, in particular, preferred it because it allowed them to generate income while taking care of household duties.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Home-based manufacturing operations were active year-round. Families willingly deployed their children in these income generating home enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kids at Work: Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labour|author=Russell Freedman|publisher=Sandpiper|year=1998|isbn=978-0395797266}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, men worked from home. In France, over 58 percent of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 and 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture. In 1946, [[Frieda S. Miller]] - then Director of the [[United States Department of Labor]] - told the International Labour Organization that these home-based operations offered, "low wages, long hours, child labour, unhealthy and insanitary working conditions."&lt;ref name=ep99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Miller, Frieda S.

Child labour is still common in many parts of the world. Estimates for child labour vary. It ranges between 250 and 304 million, if children aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted. If light occasional work is excluded, ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008. This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004. Some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming, dairy, fisheries and forestry. Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail, hawking goods, restaurants, load and transfer of goods, storage, picking and recycling trash, polishing shoes, domestic help, and other services. The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, operating machinery, and such operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Child labour in Kyrgyz coal mines |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6955202.stm |accessdate=2007-08-25 | date=24 August 2007 |first=Natalia |last=Antelava}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global child labour developments: Measuring trends from 2004 to 2008|author1=Yacouba Diallo |author2=Frank Hagemann |author3=Alex Etienne |author4=Yonca Gurbuzer |author5=Farhad Mehran |publisher=ILO|year=2010|isbn=978-92-2-123522-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web |title=The State of the World's Children 1997  |work=UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc97/report/ |accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two out of three child workers work alongside their parents, in unpaid family work situations. Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants. Child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas (70%) and informal urban sector (26%).

Contrary to popular beliefs, most child labourers are employed by their parents rather than in manufacturing or formal economy. Children who work for pay or in-kind compensation are usually found in rural settings, then urban centres. Less than 3 percent of child labour aged 5–14 across the world work outside their household, or away from their parents.&lt;ref name="ep05" /&gt;

Child labour accounts for 22% of the workforce in Asia, 32% in Africa, 17% in Latin America, 1% in the US, Canada, Europe and other wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/237384/toolkitfr/pdf/facts.pdf|title=Server Error|website=info.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of child labourers varies greatly among countries and even regions inside those countries. Africa has the highest percentage of children aged 5–17 employed as child labour, and a total of over 65 million. Asia, with its larger population, has the largest number of children employed as child labour at about 114 million. Latin America and Caribbean region have lower overall population density, but at 14 million child labourers has high incidence rates too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tackling child labour: From commitment to action|publisher=[[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] - ILO|year=2012|isbn=978-92-2-126374-6|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Informationresources/WCMS_181875/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accurate present day child labour information is difficult to obtain because of disagreements between data sources as to what constitutes child labour. In some countries, government policy contributes to this difficulty. For example, the overall extent of child labour in China is unclear due to the government categorizing child labour data as “highly secret”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Rights: China|publisher=Law Library of Congress, United States|year=2012|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/china.php#Child%20Labour%20and%20Exploitation}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has enacted regulations to prevent child labour; still, the practice of child labour is reported to be a persistent problem within China, generally in agriculture and low-skill service sectors as well as small workshops and manufacturing enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The dark side of labour in China|author=Karine Lepillez|year=2009|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/slavery/china.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China: End Child Labour in State Schools |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=4 December 2007 |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/12/02/china-end-child-labour-state-schools |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111234752/http://www.hrw.org/news/2007/12/02/china-end-child-labour-state-schools |archivedate=11 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2014, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] issued a ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' where China was attributed 12 goods the majority of which were produced by both underage children and indentured labourers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/|title=List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor|website=www.dol.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report listed electronics, garments, toys and coal among other goods.

==Causes of child labour==

===Primary causes===
International Labour Organization (ILO) suggests poverty is the greatest single cause behind child labour.&lt;ref name="ilo2008a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child labour - causes|year=2008|publisher=ILO, United Nations|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/eurpro/moscow/areas/ipec/causes.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; For impoverished households, income from a child's work is usually crucial for his or her own survival or for that of the household. Income from working children, even if small, may be between 25 and 40% of the household income. Other scholars such as Harsch on African child labour, and Edmonds and Pavcnik on global child labour have reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="ep05"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Labour in the Global Economy|author1=Eric V. Edmonds |author2=Nina Pavcnik |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=19|number=1|date=Winter 2005|pages=199–220|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hiscox/EdmondsPavcnik.pdf|doi=10.1257/0895330053147895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ernest Harsch|journal=Africa Recovery|title=Child labour rooted in Africa's poverty|volume=15|number=3|date=October 2001|pages=14–15|url=https://www.un.org/en/africarenewal/vol15no3/153chil4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basu, Kaushik and Van, Phan Hoang, 1998. 'The Economics of Child Labour', [http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/contents/ ''American Economic Review''], 88(3),412–427&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of meaningful alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO,&lt;ref name="ilo2008a" /&gt; is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work because they have nothing better to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or the quality of education is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.&lt;ref name="ep05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Relationship between Education and Child Work|author=Jo Boyden|publisher=UNICEF|year=1994|url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/crs9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural causes===
In European history when child labour was common, as well as in contemporary child labour of modern world, certain cultural beliefs have rationalised child labour and thereby encouraged it. Some view that work is good for the character-building and skill development of children. In many cultures, particular where the informal economy and small household businesses thrive, the cultural tradition is that children follow in their parents' footsteps; child labour then is a means to learn and practice that trade from a very early age. Similarly, in many cultures the education of girls is less valued or girls are simply not expected to need formal schooling, and these girls pushed into child labour such as providing domestic services.&lt;ref name="ilo2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHILD LABOUR: ISSUES, CAUSES AND INTERVENTIONS |author1=Faraaz Siddiqi |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=The World Bank |year=1999 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079934475/547667-1135281552767/Child_Labour_issues.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Labour in Latin America: Poverty as Cause and Effect |author=Michaelle Tauson |year=2009 |url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/latinamerica2/digest-human%20rights%20in%20latin%20america%20vol%202-childlabour.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Labour and Cultural Relativism: From 19th Century America to 21st Century Nepal|author=Michele D'Avolio|journal=Pace International Law Review|date=Spring 2004|volume=16|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol16/iss1/5/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macroeconomic causes===
Biggeri and Mehrotra have studied the macroeconomic factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest&lt;ref name="mbsm"&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian Informal Workers: Global Risks, Local Protection|author1=Mario Biggeri |author2=Santosh Mehrotra |publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-38275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that child labour is a serious problem in all five, but it is not a new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Policy Analysis of Child Labour: A Comparative Study|author1=Christiaan Grootaert |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0312221225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Labour and the Division of Labour in the Early English Cotton Mills|author=Douglas Galbi|journal=Journal of Population Economics|year=1997|volume=10|issue=4|pages= 357–375|url=http://www.galbithink.org/child.pdf|doi=10.1007/s001480050048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, D.

===Colonial empires===
Systematic use of child labour was common place in the colonies of European powers between 1650 and 1950. In Africa, colonial administrators encouraged traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. Millions of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries.&lt;ref name="bass04"&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Labour in Sub-Saharan Africa|author=Loretta Bass|year=2004|isbn=978-1588262868|pages=30–43|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Child Labour|author=Beverly Grier (Ed: Hugh Hindman)|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2009|pages=173–177|isbn=978-0-7656-1707-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated schemes were promulgated where children in these colonies between the ages of 5–14 were hired as an apprentice without pay in exchange for learning a craft. A system of Pauper Apprenticeship came into practice in the 19th century where the colonial master neither needed the native parents' nor child's approval to assign a child to labour, away from parents, at a distant farm owned by a different colonial master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters, Servants, and Magistrates in Britain and the Empire, 1562-1955 (Studies in Legal History)|author=Douglas Hay|year=2007|isbn=978-0807828779|pages=38–46|publisher= University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other schemes included 'earn-and-learn' programs where children would work and thereby learn. Britain for example passed a law, the so-called Masters and Servants Act of 1899, followed by Tax and Pass Law, to encourage child labour in colonies particularly in Africa. These laws offered the native people the legal ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labour of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as ''picannins''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Beyond laws, new taxes were imposed on colonies. One of these taxes was the [[tax per head|Head Tax]] in the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonial empires. The tax was imposed on everyone older than 8 years, in some colonies. To pay these taxes and cover living expenses, children in colonial households had to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child labour in the Gold Coast: the economics of work, education and the family in late-colonial Africa, c.1940-57|author=Jack Lord|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=4|issue=1|year=2011|pages=88–115|url=|doi=10.1353/hcy.2011.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invisible Hands: Child Labour and the State in Colonial Zimbabwe by Beverly Grier (a review)|author=Karen Wells|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=1|number=3|date=Fall 2008|pages=481–483 |doi= 10.1353/hcy.0.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Head Tax, Social Structure and Rural Incomes in Cameroun, 1922-1937|author=Jane Guyer|journal=Cahiers d'Études Africaines|volume=20|issue=79|year=1980|pages=305–329|doi=10.3406/cea.1980.2338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In southeast Asian colonies, such as Hong Kong, child labour such as the ''[[Mui Tsai]]'' (妹仔), was rationalised as a cultural tradition and ignored by British authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child slavery in Hong Kong: the mui tsai system|year=1930|author=Hugh Lyttleton Haslewood|publisher=Sheldon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Theorizing the Chinese: The MUI TSAI controversy and construction of transnational chineseness in Hong Kong and British Malaya|author=Karen Yuen|journal=New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies|volume= 6|number= 2| date= December 2004|pages= 95–110|url= http://www.nzasia.org.nz/downloads/NZJAS-Dec04/6_2_6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dutch East India Company]] officials rationalised their child labour abuses with, "it is a way to save these children from a worse fate." Christian mission schools in regions stretching from Zambia to Nigeria too required work from children, and in exchange provided religious education, not [[secular education]].&lt;ref name="bass04" /&gt; Elsewhere, the Canadian Dominion Statutes in form of so-called Breaches of Contract Act, stipulated jail terms for uncooperative child workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters, Servants, and Magistrates in Britain and the Empire, 1562-1955 (Studies in Legal History)|author=Douglas Hay|year=2007|isbn=978-0807828779|pages=203–207|publisher= University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals to regulate child labour began as early as 1786.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Charnovitz]], "Child Labour: What to do?," ''Journal of Commerce'', 15 August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Child labour in Africa}}
Children working at a young age has been a consistent theme throughout [[Africa]]. Many children began first working in the home to help their parents run the family farm.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|title = Children and Youth in the Labour Process in Africa|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDEwNzQ0X19BTg2?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 11}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children in Africa today are often forced into exploitative labour due to family debt and other financial factors, leading to ongoing poverty.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Other types of domestic child labour include working in commercial [[plantation]]s, begging, and other sales such as boot shining.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|title = Children and Youth in the Labour Process in Africa|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDEwNzQ0X19BTg2?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 15}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, there is an estimated five million children who are currently working in the field of agriculture which steadily increases during the time of harvest. Along with 30 percent of children who are picking coffee, there are an estimated 25,000 school age children who work year round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Children and Youth in the Labour Process in Africa|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDEwNzQ0X19BTg2?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 16}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What industries children work in depends on if they grew up in a [[rural area]] or an [[urban area]]. Children who were born in urban areas often found themselves working for street vendors, washing cars, helping in construction sites, weaving clothing, and sometimes even working as exotic dancers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While children who grew up in rural areas would work on farms doing physical labour, working with animals, and selling crops.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Of all the child workers, the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to the physical and emotional abuse they endured by their employers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To address the issue of child labour, the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child Act was implemented in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Children and Youth in the Labour Process in Africa|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDEwNzQ0X19BTg2?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 12}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet due to poverty, lack of education and ignorance, the legal actions were not/are not wholly enforced or accepted in Africa.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

Other legal factors that have been implemented to end and reduce child labour includes the global response that came into force in 1979 by the declaration of the International Year of the Child.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|title = Children and Youth in the Labour Process in Africa|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDEwNzQ0X19BTg2?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 17}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, these two declarations worked on many levels to eliminate child labour.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Although many actions have been taken to end this epidemic, child labour in Africa is still an issue today due to the unclear definition of adolescence and how much time is needed for children to engage in activities that are crucial for their development.  Another issue that often comes into play is the link between what constitutes as child labour within the household due to the cultural acceptance of children helping run the family business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Children and Youth in the Labour Process in Africa|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDEwNzQ0X19BTg2?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 18}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, there is a consistent challenge for the national government to strengthen its grip politically on child labour, and to increase education and awareness on the issue of children working below the legal age limit. With children playing an important role in the African economy, child labour still plays an important role for many in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf%2540sessionmgr110&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=121|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 765}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
From European settlement in 1788, child convicts were occasionally sent to Australia where they were made to work. Child labour was not as excessive in Australia as in Britain. With a low population, agricultural productivity was higher and families did not face starvation as in established industrialised countries. Australia also did not have significant industry until the later part of the 20th century when child labour laws, and compulsory schooling had developed under the influence of Britain. From the 1870s Child labour was restricted by compulsory schooling.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Child labour laws in Australia differ from state to state. Generally, children are allowed to work at any age, but restrictions exist for children under 15 years of age. These restrictions apply to work hours and the type of work that children can perform. In all states, children are obliged to attend school until a minimum leaving age, 15 years of age in all states except Tasmania and Queensland where the [[School-leaving age|leaving age]] is 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/find-help-for/young-workers-and-students/what-age-can-i-start-work|title=Welcome to the Fair Work Ombudsman website|website=Fair Work Ombudsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CriancaLixao20080220MarcelloCasalJrAgenciaBrasil.jpg|thumb|Child labour in [[Brazil]], leaving after collecting recyclables from a landfill.]]

Child labour has been a consistent struggle for children in [[Brazil]] ever since the country was colonised on April 22, 1500 by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Work that many children took part in was not always visible, legal, or paid. Free or slave labour was a common occurrence for many youths and was a part of their everyday lives as they grew into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27|page = 417}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet due to there being no clear definition of how to classify what a child or youth is, there has been little historical documentation of child labour during the colonial period. Due to this lack of documentation, it is hard to determine just how many children were used for what kinds of work before the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27|page = 419}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documentation of child labour in Brazil occurred during the time of indigenous societies and slave labour where it was found that children were forcibly working on tasks that exceeded their emotional and physical limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27|page = 418}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Armando Dias, for example, died in November 1913 whilst still very young, a victim of an electric shock when entering the textile industry where he worked.

In Brazil, the minimum working age has been identified as fourteen due to continuous constitutional amendments that occurred in 1934, 1937, and 1946.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27|page = 428}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet due to a change in the [[dictatorship]] by the military in the 80’s, the minimum age restriction was reduced to the age of twelve but was reviewed due to reports of dangerous and hazardous working conditions in 1988. This led to the minimum age being raised once again to 14. Another set of restrictions was passed in 1998 that restricted the kinds of work youth could partake in, such as work that was considered hazardous like running construction equipment, or certain kinds of factory work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although many steps were taken to reduce the risk and occurrence of child labour, there is still a high number of children and adolescents working under the age of fourteen in Brazil. It was not until recently in the 80’s that it was discovered that almost nine million children in Brazil were working illegally and not partaking in traditional childhood activities that help to develop important life experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 429}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian census data (PNAD, 1999) indicate that 2.55 million 10-14 year-olds were illegally holding jobs. They were joined by 3.7 million 15-17 year-olds and about 375,000 5-9 year-olds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92%2540sessionmgr112&amp;vid=16&amp;hid=126|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|publication-date = |location = |page = 5}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the raised age restriction of 14, at least half of the recorded young workers had been employed illegally which lead to many not being protect by important labour laws.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although substantial time has passed since the time of regulated child labour, there is still a large number of children working illegally in Brazil. Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence. This type of work that youth are taking part in is very dangerous due to the physical and psychological implications that come with these jobs. Yet despite the hazards that come with working with drug dealers, there has been an increase in this area of employment throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 421}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Britain ===
Many factors played a role in Britain’s long-term economic growth, such as the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] in the late 1700s and the prominent presence of child labour during the industrial age.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=9&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=9|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 121}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who worked at an early age were often not forced; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Child Labour first started to occur in [[England]] when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes, working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although there are many counts of children under the age of ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen. This age range was an important time for many youths as they were first helping to provide for their families; while also transitioning to save for their own future families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=9&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=9|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 124}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the obligation, many children had to help support their families financially; another factor that influenced child labour was the demographic changes that occurred in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Workers in England, 1780-1820 : Parish Apprentices and the Making of the Early Industrial Labour Force|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzI2OTI5MF9fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=8&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=3|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 3}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the eighteenth century, 20 percent of the population was made up of children between the ages of 5 and 14. Due to this substantial shift in available workers, and the development of the industrial revolution, children began to work earlier in life in companies outside of the home.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|title = Childhood and Child Labour in Industrial England : Diversity and Agency, 1750-1914|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzYzMzE4M19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=7&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 157}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, even though there was an increase of child labour in factories such as cotton textiles, there consistently was large numbers of children working in the field of [[agriculture]] and domestic production.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

With such a high percentage of children working, the rising of illiteracy, and the lack of a formal education became a widespread issue for many children who worked to provide for their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Childhood and Child Labour in Industrial England : Diversity and Agency, 1750-1914|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzYzMzE4M19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=7&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 163}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this problematic trend, many parents developed a change of opinion when deciding whether or not to send their children to work. Other factors that lead to the decline of child labour included financial changes in the economy, changes in the development of technology, raised wages, and continuous regulations on factory legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Childhood and Child Labour in Industrial England : Diversity and Agency, 1750-1914|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzYzMzE4M19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=7&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 169}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first legal steps taken to end the occurrence of child labour was enacted more than fifty years ago. In 1966, the nation adopted the UN General Assembly of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour in a Globalized World : A Legal Analysis of ILO Action|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fMjcwODc1X19BTg2?sid=02a823b0-8932-4058-b07b-b4ba13e729f8@sessionmgr111&amp;vid=6&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=7|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 203}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This act legally limited the minimum age for when children could start work at the age of 14. But 23 years later in 1989 the Convention on the Rights of Children was adopted and helped to reduce the exploitation of children and demanded safe working environments. They all worked towards the goal of ending the most problematic forms of child labour.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Ecuador ===
An Ecuadorean study published in 2006 found child labour to be one of the main environmental problems affecting children's health. It reported that over 800,000 children are working in Ecuador, where they are exposed to heavy metals and toxic chemicals and are subject to mental and physical stress and the insecurity caused by being at risk of work-related accidents. Minors performing agricultural work along with their parents help apply pesticides without wearing protective equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Harari,R., Harari,H., (2006), Children’s Environment and Health in Latin America: The Ecuadorian Case, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1076, 660-677.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Child labour in India}}

In 2015, the country of [[India]] is home to the largest number of children who are working illegally in various industrial industries. Agriculture in India is the largest sector where many children work at early ages to help support their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 428}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these children are forced to work at young ages due to many family factors such as unemployment, a large number of family members, poverty, and lack of parental education. This is often the major cause of the high rate of child labour in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 424}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 1757, the English East India Company defeated [[Siraj-ud-Daula]], the [[Nawab]] of Bengal, in the [[Battle of Plassey]]. The British thus became masters of east India (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa) – a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture, industry and trade.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This led to a large number of children being forced into labour due to the increasing need of cheap labour to produce large numbers of goods. Many multinationals often employed children because that they can be recruited for less pay, and have more endurance to utilise in factory environments.&lt;ref name="eds.b.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 425}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason many Indian children were hired was because they lack knowledge of their basic rights, they did not cause trouble or complain, and they were often more trustworthy. The innocence that comes with childhood was utilised to make a profit by many and was encouraged by the need for family income.&lt;ref name="eds.b.ebscohost.com" /&gt;

[[File:A-Boy-with-Monkey.jpg|thumb||An eight-year-old boy making his livelihood by showing a playful monkey in a running train in [[India]] in 2011.]]
A variety of Indian social scientists as well as the [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) have done extensive research on the numeric figures of child labour found in India and determined that India contributes to one-third of Asia’s child labour and one-fourth of the world's child labour.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 421}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a large number of children being illegally employed, the Indian government began to take extensive actions to reduce the number of children working, and to focus on the importance of facilitating the proper growth and development of children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; International influences help to encourage legal actions to be taken in India, such as the Geneva Declaration of the Right of Children Act was passed in 1924. This act was followed by [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|The Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 to which incorporated the basic human rights and needs of children for proper progression and growth in their younger years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 426}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These international acts encouraged major changes to the workforce in India which occurred in 1986 when the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was put into place. This act prohibited hiring children younger than the age of 14, and from working in hazardous conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the increase of regulations and legal restrictions on child labour, there has been a 64 percent decline in child labour from 1993-2005.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 422}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is a great decrease in the country of India, there is still high numbers of children working in the rural areas of India. With 85 percent of the child labour occurring in [[rural area]]s, and 15 percent occurring in [[urban area]]s, there are still substantial areas of concern in the country of India.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

India has legislation since 1986 which allows work by children in non-hazardous industry. In 2013, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave a landmark order that directed that there shall be a total ban on the employment of children up to the age of 14 years, be it hazardous or non-hazardous industries. However, the Court ruled that a child can work with his or her family in family based trades/occupations, for the purpose of learning a new trade/craftsmanship or vocation.&lt;sup&gt;[142]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Ireland===
In post-colonial Ireland, the rate of child exploitation was extremely high as children were used as farm labourers once they were able to walk, these children were never paid for the labour that they carried out on the family farm. Children were wanted and desired in Ireland for the use of their labour on the family farm. Irish parents felt that it was the children's duty to carry out chores on the family farm &lt;ref&gt;Curtin, Chris and Anthony Varley. 1984.

===Japan===
Though banned in modern Japan, ''shonenko'' (child labourers) were a feature of the Imperial era until its end in 1945. During [[World War 2]] labour recruiting efforts targeted youths from [[Taiwan|Taiwan (Formosa)]], then a Japanese territory, with promises of educational opportunity. Though the target of 25,000 recruits was never reached, over 8,400 Taiwanese youths aged 12 to 14 relocated to Japan to help manufacture the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therunagatesclub.blogspot.tw/2008/06/shonenko-taiwanese-boys-who-built.html|title=SHONENKO - the Taiwanese boys who built Mitsubishi aircraft as Japan's defences crumbled|website=therunagatesclub.blogspot.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipixels.net/twff/shonenko-En.html|title=shonenko-En|website=ipixels.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quietsummer.com/Emeraldhorizon/SBackgroundE.html|title=SHONENKO - BACKGROUND|website=www.quietsummer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
[[Child labour in the Netherlands|Child labour]] existed in the Netherlands up to and through the Industrial Revolution. Laws governing child labour in factories were first passed in 1874, but child labour on farms continued to be the norm up until the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Soviet Union and Russia ===
Although formally banned since 1922, child labour was widespread in the [[Soviet Union]], mostly in the form of mandatory, [[unpaid work]] by schoolchildren on Saturdays and holidays. The students were used as a cheap, unqualified workforce on [[kolhoz|''kolhoz'' (collective farms)]] as well as in industry and forestry. The practice was formally called "work education".&lt;ref&gt;Svetlana Stephenson, [http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=child "Child Labour in the Russian Federation"], 2002, University of North London&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s on, the students were also used for unpaid work at schools, where they cleaned and performed repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Евгений Жирнов, [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/798328 Среднее и высшее самообслуживание], 2007, Kommersant&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has continued in the Russian Federation, where up to 21 days of the summer holidays is sometimes set aside for school works. By law, this is only allowed as part of specialised occupational training and with the students' and parents' permission, but those provisions are widely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otvet.mail.ru/question/77019732|title=Ответы@Mail.Ru: Школьников заставляют работать в школьном участке в каникулах. 21 дней.

Out of former [[Soviet Union]] republics [[Uzbekistan]] continued and expanded the program of child labour on industrial scale to increase profits on the main source of [[Islam Karimov]]'s income, cotton harvesting. In September, when school normally starts, the classes are suspended and children are sent to cotton fields for work, where they are assigned daily quotas of 20 to 60&amp;nbsp;kg of raw cotton they have to collect. This process is repeated in spring, when collected cotton needs to be hoed and weeded. In 2006 it is estimated that 2.7 million children were forced to work this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty |author=[[Daron Acemoglu]], James Robinson |pages=loc. 6515–6529 (MOBI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
{{Main|Child labour in Switzerland}}

As in many other countries, [[child labour in Switzerland]] affected among the so-called ''[[Kaminfegerkinder]]'' ("chimney sweep children") and children working p.e. in spinning mills, factories and in agriculture in 19th-century Switzerland,&lt;ref name="hds-kinderarbeit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D13909.php|title=Kinderabeit|publisher=HDS|author=Thomas Gull|language=German|date=2008-10-13|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also to the 1960s so-called ''[[Verdingkinder]]'' (literally: "contract children" or "indentured child laborers") were children who were taken from their parents, often due to poverty or ''moral reasons'' – usually mothers being unmarried, very poor citizens, of [[Names of the Romani people|Gypsy]]–[[Yeniche people|Yeniche]] origin, so-called ''[[Kinder der Landstrasse]]'',&lt;ref name="roger_sablonier_unizh-publikationen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.uzh.ch/fachbereiche/mittelalter/emeriti/sablonier/publikationen.html|title=Prof. Dr. Roger Sablonier, Publikationen|publisher=[[University of Zürich]], Historisches Seminar|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. – and sent to live with new families, often poor farmers who needed cheap labour.&lt;ref name="wiedergutmachungsinitiative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiedergutmachung.ch/|title=Wiedergutmachungsinitiative|publisher=wiedergutmachung.ch|language=German|date=2014|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were even ''Verdingkinder'' auctions where children were handed over to the farmer asking the least amount of money from the authorities, thus securing cheap labour for his farm and relieving the authority from the financial burden of looking after the children. In the 1930s 20% of all agricultural labourers in the [[Canton of Bern]] were children below the age of 15. Swiss municipality guardianship authorities acted so, commonly tolerated by federal authorities, to the 1960s, not all of them of course, but usually communities affected of low taxes in some Swiss cantons&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Swiss historian Marco Leuenberger investigated, that in 1930 there were some 35,000 indentured children, and between 1920 and 1970 more than 100,000 are believed to have been placed with families or homes. 10,000 ''Verdingkinder'' are still alive.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29765623|title=Switzerland's shame: The children used as cheap farm labour|publisher=BBC News|author=Kavita Puri|language=|date=2014-10-29|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/opinion/slaverys-shadow-on-switzerland.html?_r=0|title=Slavery’s Shadow on Switzerland|publisher=New York Times|author=Tony Wild|language=|date=2014-11-10|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the so-called ''[[Wiedergutmachungsinitiative]]'' was started in April 2014.

{{Main|Child labour laws}}
{{See also|Legal working age}}

Almost every country in the world has laws relating to and aimed at preventing child labour. International Labour Organization has helped set international law, which most countries have signed on and ratified. According to ILO [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|minimum age convention (C138)]] of 1973, child labour refers to any work performed by children under the age of 12, non-light work done by children aged 12–14, and hazardous work done by children aged 15–17. Light work was defined, under this Convention, as any work that does not harm a child's health and development, and that does not interfere with his or her attendance at school. This convention has been ratified by 135 countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Retrieved 21 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 32 of the convention addressed child labour, as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Parties recognise the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |work=United Nations |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003230539/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=3 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under Article 1 of the 1990 Convention, a child is defined as "... every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child, a majority is attained earlier." Article 28 of this Convention requires States to, "make primary education compulsory and available free to all."&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;

195 countries are party to the Convention; only two nations have not ratified the treaty, [[Somalia]] and the [[US ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child|United States]].&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government of Somalia ratifies UN Convention on the Rights of the Child|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_78732.html?p=printme|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ILO helped lead the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|Worst Forms Convention 182]] (C182),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C182 - Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999|publisher=International Labour Organization, United Nations|year=1999|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312327}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has so far been signed upon and domestically ratified by 151 countries including the United States. This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labour, including forced recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work. Both the Worst Forms Convention (C182) and the Minimum Age Convention (C138) are examples of [[international labour standards]] implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.

In addition to setting the international law, the United Nations initiated International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC)|publisher=International Labour Organization, United Nations|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative aims to progressively eliminate child labour through strengthening national capacities to address some of the causes of child labour. Amongst the key initiative is the so-called time-bounded programme countries, where child labour is most prevalent and schooling opportunities lacking. The initiative seeks to achieve amongst other things, universal primary school availability. The IPEC has expanded to at least the following target countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, [[Child labour in Nepal|Nepal]], Tanzania, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa and Turkey.

Targeted child labour campaigns were initiated by the [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC) in order to advocate for prevention and elimination of all forms of child labour. The global Music against Child Labour Initiative was launched in 2013 in order to involve socially excluded children in structured musical activity and education in efforts to help protect them from child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music Against Child Labour Initiative|publisher= IPEC, International Labour Organization, United Nations|year=2013|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/MusicInitiative/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in 1996, member countries of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC,&lt;ref name="EUR-Lex"/&gt; agreed to a number of exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the competent authority. Children above the age of 13 &lt;!--  --&gt;may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protections of young people at work|publisher=Europa|year=2004|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/employment_and_social_policy/health_hygiene_safety_at_work/c11205_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, many children under the age of 13 do work, even in the most developed countries of the EU.

Scholars disagree on the best legal course forward to address child labour. Some suggest the need for laws that place a blanket ban on any work by children less than 18 years old. Others suggest the current international laws are enough, and the need for more engaging approach to achieve the ultimate goals.&lt;ref name=sosecon&gt;{{cite news|title=Sickness or symptom? - Child Labour|publisher=The Economist|date=5 February 2004|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2405051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=January 2016}} suggest any labour by children aged 18 years or less is wrong since this encourages illiteracy, inhumane work and lower investment in human capital. Child labour, claim these activists, also leads to poor labour standards for adults, depresses the wages of adults in developing countries as well as the developed countries, and dooms the third world economies to low-skill jobs only capable of producing poor quality cheap exports. More children that work in poor countries, the fewer and worse-paid are the jobs for adults in these countries. In other words, there are moral and economic reasons that justify a blanket ban on labour from children aged 18 years or less, everywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Child Labour Inefficient?|author=Jean‐Marie Baland and James A.

Other scholars{{who|date=January 2016}} suggest that these arguments are flawed, ignores history and more laws will do more harm than good. According to them, child labour is merely the symptom of a greater disease named poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it is a necessity, the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable of a set of very bad choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Policy Analysis of Child Labour: A Comparative Study|author1=Christiaan Grootaert |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1999|pages=8–54|isbn=978-0312221225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economics of Consumer Actions against Products with Child Labour Content|author=Eric Edmonds|date=May 2007|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~eedmonds/clwa.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These scholars suggest, from their studies of economic and social data, that early 20th-century child labour in Europe and the United States ended in large part as a result of the economic development of the formal regulated economy, technology development and general prosperity. Child labour laws and ILO conventions came later. Edmonds suggests, even in contemporary times, the incidence of child labour in Vietnam has rapidly reduced following economic reforms and GDP growth. These scholars suggest economic engagement, emphasis on opening quality schools rather than more laws and expanding economically relevant skill development opportunities in the third world. International legal actions, such as trade sanctions increase child labour.&lt;ref name=sosecon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Does Child Labour Decline with Improving Economic Status?|author=Eric Edmonds|journal=Journal of Human Resources| volume=40|number= 1|date=Winter 2005|pages=77–99|doi=10.3368/jhr.XL.1.77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The economics of child labour: A framework for measurement|author=Richard ANKER|journal=International Labour Review|volume=139|issue=3|pages=257–280|date=September 2000|doi=10.1111/j.1564-913X.2000.tb00204.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Will trade sanctions reduce child labour?: The role of credit markets|author1=Saqib Jafareya |author2=Sajal Lahiri |journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=68|issue=1|date=June 2002|pages=137–156|doi=10.1016/S0304-3878(02)00009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[The Incredible Bread Machine]]", a book published by "World Research, Inc." in 1974, stated:

{{blockquote|Child labour was a particular target of early reformers. William Cooke Tatlor wrote at the time about these reformers who, witnessing children at work in the factories, thought to themselves: 'How much more delightful would have been the gambol of the free limbs on the hillside; the sight of the green mead with its spangles of buttercups and daisies; the song of the bird and the humming bee...'
But for many of these children the factory system meant quite literally the only chance for survival. Today we overlook the fact that death from starvation and exposure was a common fate before the Industrial Revolution, for the pre-capitalist economy was barely able to support the population. Yes, children were working. Formerly they would have starved. It was only as goods were produced in greater abundance at a lower cost that men could support their families without sending their children to work. It was not the reformer or the politician that ended the grim necessity for child labour; it was capitalism.}}

Glencore mentioned being aware of child miners who were part of a group of artisanal miners who had without authorisation raided the concession awarded to the company since 2010; Glencore has been pleading with the government to remove the artisanal miners from the concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mining giant Glencore accused in child labour and acid dumping row|author=John Sweeney|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 April 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/14/glencore-child-labour-acid-dumping-row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale [[artisanal mining]] of gold is another source of dangerous child labour in poor rural areas in certain parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Poisonous Mix - Child Labour, Mercury, and Artisanal Gold Mining in Mali|author=Human Rights Watch|year=2011|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/mali1211_forinsertWebUpload_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of mining uses labour-intensive and low-tech methods. It is informal sector of the economy. Human Rights Watch group estimates that about 12 percent of global gold production comes from artisanal mines. In west Africa, in countries such as [[Mali]] - the third largest exporter of gold in Africa - between 20,000 and 40,000 children work in artisanal mining. Locally known as ''orpaillage'', children as young as 6 years old work with their families. These children and families suffer chronic exposure to toxic chemicals including [[Mercury poisoning|mercury]], and do hazardous work such as digging shafts and working underground, pulling up, carrying and crushing the ore. The poor work practices harm the long term health of children, as well as release hundreds of tons of mercury every year into local rivers, ground water and lakes. Gold is important to the economy of Mali and Ghana. For Mali, it is the second largest earner of its export revenue. For many poor families with children, it is the primary and sometimes the only source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child labour in gold mining|publisher=ILO, United Nations|year=2012|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Miningandquarrying/MoreaboutCLinmining/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artisanal Gold Mining: Unglamorous Practices at High Prices |author=Sandra Garcia |publisher=Mining Magazine |date=April 2010 |url=http://magazine.mining.com/issues/1003/Vol03-02-ArtisanalGoldMining-36-38.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meatpacking===
In early August 2008, [[Iowa]] Labour Commissioner David Neil announced that his department had found that [[Agriprocessors]], a [[kosher]] [[meatpacking]] company in [[Postville, Iowa|Postville]] which had recently been raided by [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], had employed 57 minors, some as young as 14, in violation of state law prohibiting anyone under 18 from working in a meatpacking plant.  Neil announced that he was turning the case over to the state Attorney General for prosecution, claiming that his department's inquiry had discovered "egregious violations of virtually every aspect of Iowa's child labour laws."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/us/06meat.html?hp Inquiry Finds Under-Age Workers at Meat Plant.] The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; Agriprocessors claimed that it was at a loss to understand the allegations. Agriprocessors' CEO went to trial on these charges in state court on 4 May 2010. After a five-week trial he was found not guilty of all 57 charges of child labour violations by the Black Hawk County District Court jury in Waterloo, Iowa, on 7 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Preston (7 June 2010).

===GAP===
[[File:Ooty 15.jpg|thumbnail|Working child in [[Ooty]], India]]
A 2007 report claimed some GAP products had been produced by child labourers. GAP acknowledged the problem and announced it is pulling the products from its shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/28/ethicalbusiness.india|title=Child sweatshop shame threatens Gap's ethical image|first=Dan|last=McDougall|date=28 October 2007|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found Gap had rigorous social audit systems since 2004 to eliminate child labour in its supply chain. However, the report concluded that the system was being abused by unscrupulous subcontractors.

GAP's policy, the report claimed, is that if it discovers child labour was used by its supplier in its branded clothes, the contractor must remove the child from the workplace, provide it with access to schooling and a wage, and guarantee the opportunity of work on reaching a legal working age.

In 2007, The New York Times reported that GAP, after the child labour discovery, created a $200,000 grant to improve working conditions in the supplier community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/business/worldbusiness/15iht-gap.1.8349422.html|title=Gap moves to recover from child labor scandal|first=Amelia|last=Gentleman|date=15 November 2007|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===H&amp;M and Zara===
In December 2009, campaigners in the UK called on two leading high street retailers to stop selling clothes made with cotton which may have been picked by children. [[Anti-Slavery International]] and the [[Environmental Justice Foundation]] (EJF) accused [[H&amp;M]] and [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]] of using cotton suppliers in Bangladesh. It is also suspected that many of their raw materials originates from Uzbekistan, where children aged 10 are forced to work in the fields. The activists were calling to ban the use of Uzbek cotton and implement a "track and trace" systems to guarantee an ethical responsible source of the material.

H&amp;M said it "does not accept" child labour and "seeks to avoid" using Uzbek cotton, but admitted it did "not have any reliable methods" to ensure Uzbek cotton did not end up in any of its products. [[Inditex]], the owner of Zara, said its code of conduct banned child labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itn.co.uk/d42d75c1cd515910d3b780d161e03b0d.html "Stores urged to stop using child labour cotton"] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silk weaving===
A 2003 Human Rights Watch report claimed children as young as five years old were employed and worked for up to 12 hours a day and six to seven days a week in silk industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/news/2003/jan/23silk.htm|title=Indian silk industry employs child labour: Human Rights Watch|date=23 January 2003|publisher=[[Rediff]]|accessdate = 2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children, HRW claimed, were bonded [[child labour in India]], easy to find in [[Karnataka]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1801/18010660.htm|title=Child Labour: Blood on silk |work=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|accessdate = 2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a German news investigative report claimed that in silk weaving industry, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) had found up to 10,000 children working in the 1,000 silk factories in 1998. In other places, thousands of bonded child labour were present in 1994. After UNICEF and NGOs got involved, after 2005, child labour figure is drastically lower, with the total estimated to be fewer than a thousand child labourers. The released children were back in school, claims the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India: Freeing the Small Hands of the Silk Industry|publisher=Deutsche Welle (Germany)|year=2010|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1114659,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primark===
In 2008, the BBC reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7468927.stm|title=BBC News - Embroidered T-shirt. Price: £4. Cost: Misery|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the company [[Primark]] was using child labour in the manufacture of clothing. In particular, a £4 hand-embroidered shirt was the starting point of a documentary produced by [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme. The programme asks consumers to ask themselves, "Why am I only paying £4 for a hand embroidered top? This item looks handmade. Who made it for such little cost?", in addition to exposing the violent side of the child labour industry in countries where child exploitation is prevalent.

As a result of the BBC report, Royal Television Society awarded it a prize, and Primark took immediate action and fired three Indian suppliers in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7456897.stm|title=BBC News - Primark fires child worker firms|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primark continued to investigate the allegations for three years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primarkresponse.com/panorama/timeline-of-events/ Primark's Investigation findings of BBC's fake reporting on child labour, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911094612/http://www.primarkresponse.com/panorama/timeline-of-events/ |date=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that BBC report was a fake. In 2011, following an investigation by the [[BBC Trust]]’s Editorial Standards Committee, the BBC announced, "Having carefully scrutinised all of the relevant evidence, the committee concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, it was more likely than not that the [[Bangalore]] footage was not authentic." BBC subsequently apologised for faking footage, and returned the television award for investigative reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/bbcs-primark-apology-over-fake-child-labour-footage|title=BBC’s Primark apology over ‘fake’ child labour footage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8579966/BBC-to-apologise-over-faked-footage-in-Panorama-report-about-Primark.html|title=BBC to apologise over 'faked footage' in Panorama report about Primark|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/28/bbc-hands-back-panorama-rts-award|title=BBC hands back RTS award for Panorama programme on Primark|first=Josh|last=Halliday|date=28 June 2011|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eliminating child labour==
[[File:Childlabourcoal.jpg|thumb|Child labour in a coal mine, [[United States]], c. 1912. Photograph by [[Lewis Hine]].]]
[[File:HN99~Worker 7xKidsWork.jpg|thumb|Different forms of child labour in [[Central America]], 1999.]]

Concerns have often been raised over the buying public's moral complicity in purchasing products assembled or otherwise manufactured in [[developing countries]] with child labour. However, others have raised concerns that [[boycott]]ing products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or strenuous professions, such as prostitution or agriculture. For example, a [[UNICEF]] study found that after the [[Child Labor Deterrence Act|Child Labour Deterrence Act]] was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in [[Bangladesh]], leaving many to resort to jobs such as "stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution", jobs that are "more hazardous and exploitative than garment production". The study suggests that boycotts are "blunt instruments with long-term consequences, that can actually harm rather than help the children involved."&lt;ref name="unicef"/&gt;

According to [[Milton Friedman]], before the Industrial Revolution virtually all children worked in agriculture.&lt;ref name="Schultz2010"&gt;"Some authors such as conservative Nobel economist Milton Friedman claim that child labour actually decreased during the industrial revolution. He argues that before the industrial revolution almost all children were working in agriculture(...)" {{cite book|author=Robert A. Schultz|title=Information Technology and the Ethics of Globalization: Transnational Issues and Implications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Fk7pHWGERoC|accessdate=7 July 2013|year=2010|publisher=IGI Global Snippet|isbn=978-1-60566-923-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Industrial Revolution many of these children moved from farm work to factory work.  Over time, as real wages rose, parents became able to afford to send their children to school instead of work and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Cunningham, "The Employment and Unemployment of Children in England c.1680–1851." ''Past and Present''. Feb. 1990. {{doi|10.1093/past/126.1.115}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] said that British and American children of the pre- and post-Industrial Revolution lived and suffered in infinitely worse conditions where jobs were not available for them and went "voluntarily and gladly" to work in factories.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothbard, [https://www.mises.org/daily/1607 Down With Primitivism: A Thorough Critique of Polanyi] [[Ludwig Von Mises Institute]], reprint of June 1961 article.&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian and socialist [[E. P. Thompson]] in ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' draws a qualitative distinction between child domestic work and participation in the wider (waged) labour market.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt; Further, the usefulness of the experience of the industrial revolution in making predictions about current trends has been disputed. Social historian Hugh Cunningham, author of ''Children and Childhood in Western Society Since 1500'', notes that:
:''"Fifty years ago it might have been assumed that, just as child labour had declined in the developed world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, so it would also, in a trickle-down fashion, in the rest of the world. Its failure to do that, and its re-emergence in the developed world, raise questions about its role in any economy, whether national or global."''&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Cunningham, "The decline of child labour: labour markets and family economies in Europe and North America since 1830", ''Economic History Review'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Thomas DeGregori, an economics professor at the [[University of Houston]], in an article published by the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think-tank operating in Washington D.C., "it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools. Then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer, healthier lives. However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century. So, while the struggle to end child labour is necessary, getting there often requires taking different routes—and, sadly, there are many political obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;DeGregori, Thomas R., [http://www.cato.org/dailys/10-08-02.html "Child Labour or Child Prostitution?"] Cato Institute. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013140459/http://www.cato.org/dailys/10-08-02.html |date=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC), founded in 1992, aims to eliminate child labour. It operates in 88 countries and is the largest program of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=ipec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/programme/lang--en/|title=About the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) (IPEC)|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPEC works with international and government agencies, NGOs, the media, and children and their families to end child labour and provide children with education and assistance.&lt;ref name=ipec/&gt;

From 2008 to 2013, the [[ILO]] operated a program through [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC) entitled "Combating Abusive Child Labour (CACL-II)". The project, funded by the [[European Union]], contributed to the [[Government of Pakistan]] by providing alternative opportunities for vocational training and education to children withdrawn from the worst forms of child labour.&lt;ref name="Combating Abusive Child Labour II"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/islamabad/whatwedo/projects/WCMS_143210/lang--en/index.htm|title=Combating Abusive Child Labour II|date=1 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodically, governments, employers' and workers' organisations have met in global conference to assess progress and remaining obstacles and to agree measures to eliminate the worst forms of child labour by 2016: first in [[Oslo]] (1997), secondly in [[The Hague]] (2010); the third Global Conference on Child Labour took place in [[Brasilia]], 8010 October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;ILO, [http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/BrasiliaConference/lang--en/index.htm III Global Conference on Child Labour - Brasilia, 8-10 October 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth global conference is scheduled to be held in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], 14–16 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;ILO, [http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/BuenosAiresConference/lang--it/index.htm IV Global Conference on the Sustained Eradication of Child Labour, Buenos Aires, 14-16 November 2017], accessed 17 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential positives of children working==

The term child labour can be misleading when it confuses harmful work with employment that may be beneficial to children. It can also ignore harmful work outside employment and any benefits children normally derive from their work.&lt;ref&gt;For examples see Bourdillon et al pp 1-6, 180-194.  Pp 195-200 offer an alternative and more effective approach to protecting working children.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domestic work is an example: all families but the rich must work at cleaning, cooking, caring, and more to maintain their homes. In most families in the world, this process extends to productive activities, especially herding and various types of agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Polak|first=Barbara|contribution=Bamana Peasants' Children at Work: Deconstructing Stereotypes of Child Work|year=2012|title= African Children at Work: Working and Learning in Growing Up for Life|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Berlin|editor=Gerd Spittler and Michael Bourdillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and to a variety of small family businesses. Where trading is a significant feature of social life, children can start trading in small items at an early age, often in the company of family members or of peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Invernizzi|first=Antonella|title=Street-Working Children and Adolescents in Lima: Work as an Agent of Socialization|journal=Childhood|date=2003|volume=10|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work is undertaken from an early age by vast numbers of children in the world and may have a natural place in growing up.&lt;ref name="Bourdillon 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdillon|first=Michael|title=Rights and Wrongs of Children's Work|date=2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick|author2=Deborah Levison |author3=William Myers |author4=Ben White }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Work can contribute to the well-being of children in a variety of ways;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdillon|first=Michael|title="Children's Work" in Handbook of Child-Well Being|date=2013|publisher=Springer|editor=Asher Ben-Arieh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  children often choose to work to improve their lives, both in the short- and long-term. At the material level, children’s work often contributes to producing food or earning income that benefits themselves and their families; and such income is especially important when the families are poor. Work can provide an escape from debilitating poverty, sometimes by allowing a young person to move away from an impoverished environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hashim|first=Iman M.|title=Child Migration in Africa|date=2011|publisher=Zed Books|location=London|author2=Dorte Thorsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young people often enjoy their work, especially paid work, or when work involves the company of peers. Even when work is intensive and enforced, children often find ways to combine their work with play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Cindi|title=Growing Up Global: Economic Restructuring and Children's Everyday Lives|date=2004|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While full-time work hinders schooling, empirical evidence is varied on the relationship between part-time work and school.&lt;ref name="Bourdillon 2010"/&gt;   Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance.  On the other hand, many poor children work for resources to attend school. Children who are not doing well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work. Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Call|first=Kathleen|title=Arenas of Comfort in Adolescence: A Study of Adjustment in Context|date=2001|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=London|author2=Jeylan T. Mortimer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the modern world, school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Qvortrup|first =Jens |contribution =School-Work, Paid Work and the Changing Obligations of Childhood|year =2001|title =Hidden Hands: International Perspectives on Children's Work and Labour|editor-last =Mizen|editor-first =Philip|place =London|publisher =Routledge.}}&lt;/ref&gt; often replacing participation in productive work. If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork, school may impede the learning of skills, such as agriculture, which will become necessary for future livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Ben|title=Agriculture and the Generation Problem: Rural Youth, Employment, and the Future of Farming|journal=IDS Bulletin|date=2012|volume=43|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1778">'''Coordination failure''' is the [[electoral]] problem resulting from [[competition]] between two or more [[Nomination|candidates]] or [[political parties]] from the same or approximate location in the political ideological spectrum or space against an opposing candidate or political party from the other side of the political ideological spectrum or space.  The resulting fragmentation of political support may result in electoral defeat.  Coordination failures, and thus political calculations attempting to avoid them, appear most frequently in elections involving executives and representatives from single member districts.  

"Coordination Failure" in a game-theoretic context is a state of affairs in which agents' inability to coordinate their behavior (choices) leads to an outcome (equilibrium) that leaves all agents worse off than in an alternative situation that is also an equilibrium. This can occur due to lack of information, inefficiencies, or differing expectations.

[[File:Carte Guerre de Sept Ans Europe.PNG|thumb|300px|The alliances formed as a result of the Diplomatic Revolution.]]

The '''Diplomatic Revolution of 1756''' was the reversal of longstanding alliances in Europe between the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;D.B. Horn, "The Diplomatic Revolution" in J.O. Lindsay, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History vol. 7, The Old Regime: 1713–63'' (1957): pp 449–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  Austria went from an ally of Britain to an ally of France, while Prussia became an ally of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''Essay and Reflection: On the 'Old System' and the Diplomatic Revolution' of the Eighteenth Century" ''International History Review'' (1990) 12#2 pp. 301–323 &lt;/ref&gt; The most influential diplomat involved was an Austrian statesman, [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Franz A.J. Szabo, "Prince Kaunitz and the Balance of Power." ''International History Review'' 1#3 (1979): 399–408. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40105021 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The change was part of the [[stately quadrille]], a constantly shifting pattern of alliances throughout the 18th century, efforts to preserve or upset the [[European balance of power]].

== Background ==

The diplomatic change was triggered by a separation of interests between Austria, Britain, and France. The [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]], after the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] in 1748, left Austria aware of the high price it paid [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|in having Britain as an ally]]. [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] had defended her claim to the Habsburg throne and had her husband, Francis Stephen, crowned Emperor in 1745. However, she had been forced to relinquish valuable territory in the process. Under British diplomatic pressure, Maria Theresa had given up most of [[Lombardy]] and occupied [[Bavaria]]. The British also forced her to cede [[Parma]] to Spain and, more importantly, to abandon the valuable state of [[Silesia]] to Prussian occupation.

During the war, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II ("the Great")]] of Prussia had seized Silesia, one of the Bohemian crown lands. That acquisition had further advanced Prussia as a great European power, which now posed an increasing threat to Austria's German lands and to Central Europe as a whole. The growth of Prussia, dangerous to Austria, was welcomed by the British, who saw it as a means of balancing French power and reducing French influence in Germany, which might otherwise have grown in response to Austria's weakness.

== Westminster Convention ==
{{Main article|Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)}}
The results of the War of Austrian Succession made it clear that Britain no longer viewed Austria as powerful enough to check French power but was content to build up smaller states like Prussia. Therefore, Britain and Prussia, in the Westminster Convention (16 January 1756), agreed that Britain would not aid Austria in a renewed conflict for Silesia if Prussia agreed to protect [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanover]] from France. Protection of Hanover was important to Britain because it was a possession of its king, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] (who was born and raised in the Electorate). Britain felt that with Prussia's growing strength, it would be more apt to defend Hanover than Austria. Meanwhile, Austria was determined to reclaim Silesia so the two allies found themselves with conflicting interests. Maria Theresa recognized the futility of renewed alliance with Britain and so set out to align Austria with France, who could replace Britain as a valuable ally. Maria Theresa knew that without a powerful ally such as France, she could never hope to reclaim Silesia from Frederick.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Habsburg Monarchy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 157–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement was followed by a more direct [[Anglo-Prussian Convention]] in 1758.

== First Treaty of Versailles ==
{{Main article|Treaty of Versailles (1756)}}
Maria Theresa sent her foreign policy minister, Count [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]], to France to secure an alliance to enable Austria to reclaim Silesia. Kaunitz approached [[Madame de Pompadour]], [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s mistress, to intervene in the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitford|first1=Nancy|title=Madame de Pompadour|date=31 March 2001|publisher=New York Review of Books|isbn=978-0-940322-65-3|pages=213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEjxtxanbCwC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;hl=en|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Louis XV proved reluctant to agree to any treaty presented by Kaunitz. Only with renewed aggression between France and Britain was Louis made to align with Austria.

Furthermore, Austria no longer surrounded France; instead, Frederick II had managed to end the prospect of Habsburg-German dominion bordering French lands. Therefore, France no longer saw Austria as an immediate threat and so entered into a defensive alliance with Austria. In response to the Westminster Convention, Louis XV’s ministers and Kaunitz concluded the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] (1 May 1756), both sides agreeing to remain neutral and to provide 24,000 troops if either one got into conflict with a third party.
== Second Treaty of Versailles ==
{{Main|Treaty of Versailles (1757)}}
Maria Theresa's diplomats, after securing French neutrality, actively began to establish an anti-Prussian coalition. Austria's actions alerted Frederick II, who decided to strike first by invading Saxony, commencing the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763). Frederick's actions were meant to scare Russia out of supporting Austria (the two countries had previously entered into a defensive alliance in 1746). However, by invading [[Saxony]], Frederick had inflamed his enemies; Russia, under the direction of [[Empress Elizabeth]], sent an additional 80,000 troops to Austria. One year after the signing of the First Treaty of Versailles, France and Austria signed a new offensive alliance, the Second Treaty of Versailles, on 1 May 1757.

In it, Austria promised France the Austrian Netherlands, but in return, Maria Theresa would receive Parma as well as 129,000 French troops and the promise of 12 million livres every year until [[Silesia]] was returned to Austria.

== Aftermath ==

As a result of this diplomatic revolution, Britain and Prussia faced Austria, France and Russia. Despite the reversal of alliances, however, the basic antagonisms remained: Prussia versus Austria and Britain versus France. All the tensions erupted during the Seven Years' War to which the Diplomatic Revolution is considered{{by whom|date=June 2015}} a prelude.

The war ended in a victory for Britain and Prussia. Britain's control of the seas and Prussia's formidable army proved to be a winning combination, despite the attempts of France, Austria and their European allies to preserve the balance of power.

However, the [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian alliance]] proved to be short-lived largely because Britain withdrew financial and military support for Prussia in 1762; Prussia subsequently allied with Russia instead. The dissolution of the alliance and the pre-eminent rise of Britain left it with no allies by the time the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out.

The '''Dwekh Nawsha''' ({{lang-syr|ܕܒ݂ܝܚ ܢܦ̮ܫܐ}}; literally "one who sacrifices") is a military organization created in June 2014 in order to defend Iraq's [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population from the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), and possibly retake [[Assyrian homeland|their lands]] currently controlled by ISIL. They are a Christian militia.

The Dwekh Nawsha operates in coordination with the regional and international security forces.&lt;ref name=almonoct2014&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/10/iraq-christian-paramilitary-forces-nineveh.html | title=Iraq's Christian paramilitaries split in IS fight | date=30 October 2014 | agency=[[Al-Monitor]] | accessdate=10 March 2015 | author=Henderson, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Europa Universalis II''''' is a [[strategy game|strategy computer game]] developed by [[Paradox Development Studio]] and published by [[Strategy First]], based on world [[history]] spanning a timeline between 1419 through 1820. It was released on December 11, 2001.

==Gameplay==
In the game, the player controls a single nation across many centuries, managing its economy, military, political alliances, scientific development, exploration and colonization, religious affairs, and internal stability. In addition, yearly random events, as well as hundreds of pre-scripted ones based on the historical record, make for a great deal of gameplay challenge and variety.

''Europa Universalis II'' differs from many similar [[turn-based]] strategy games in that time flows continuously during gameplay, rather than taking place in discrete turns. The player is able to pause the action to ponder the situation and give orders, then speed up or slow down time to let events take their course.

The game ships with several historical scenarios, including games that take place during the [[Age of Exploration]], the [[American Revolution]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The Grand Campaign lets players choose one world power and guide it from the end of the [[Middle Ages]] and into the 19th century. There is also a Fantasy Scenario, starting in an unoccupied and unexplored earth with only 8 civilizations to choose. In this scenario, casual gameplay and strategy that should be applied are slightly different, more like a [[4X]] game with a strong emphasis on colonization.

While the Grand Campaign is geared primarily towards the major European powers of the time, such as [[Austria]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]],  and [[Ottoman Empire]], the game is unique in that players can choose to play as one of more than a hundred obscure, no longer existing nations, from the Indian subcontinent to the Balkans.

==Development==
The game was developed by [[Paradox Interactive]] as a sequel to ''[[Europa Universalis]]'', and was first released for the [[Personal computer|PC]] in 2001 by [[Strategy First]], with a Macintosh port created by [[Virtual Programming]] and published by [[MacPlay]]. A [[Linux]] port was in development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_gaming_frank&amp;num=1 | title = An Interview With A Linux Game Porter | publisher = Phoronix }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not released.

===Game modding===
The game goes into a great deal of granular detail, including urban populations for each of the hundreds of provinces, thousands of historical monarchs, generals, and explorers, as well as names for colonies, armies, and fleets.

In addition, with almost all of the game data stored in easy-to-edit text files, Europa Universalis II is easy to modify and customize, which has yielded a large and thriving [[mod (computer gaming)|mod community]]. Players have been able to create new flags, maps, units, historical events, leaders and even entire scenarios.

It is also possible to play a campaign beginning with ''[[Crusader Kings (video game)|Crusader Kings]]'', followed by ''Europa Universalis II'', ''[[Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun|Victoria]]'' (or ''[[Victoria II]]'') and finished with ''[[Hearts of Iron II#Doomsday|Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday]]'', allowing for campaigns to range from 1066 to 1954.  This is by using the in-built features of these games that convert a saved campaign to the chronologically-next Paradox title.

===Asia chapters===
A version of the game, called ''Europa Universalis II: Asia Chapters'', was released for Asian markets, adding new graphics and scenarios that center around [[Asian history]] instead. It featured an updated map with greater detail and added provinces in [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[China]].

The '''European Movement UK''' is an independent [[pressure group]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which campaigns in support of greater [[European integration]] and for reform of the [[European Union]]. It is part of the [[European Movement International]] which pushes for a "democratic, federal, enlarged European Union".

The current President of the European Movement UK is [[Paddy Ashdown|Lord Ashdown]] and the current chairman (since December 2016) is [[Stephen Dorrell]]. The organisation promotes a "more democratic, effective and accountable" EU. It opposes Brexit.

== History ==

The origins of the [[European Movement International|European Movement]] lie in the aftermath of the [[Second World War]]. More than eight hundred delegates from across [[Europe]] gathered in [[The Hague]] in May 1948, under the chairmanship of Sir [[Winston Churchill]], to create a new international movement to promote European unity and prevent further wars between its European countries. The British section of the European Movement was founded a year later.

During the UK's [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|European Communities membership referendum]] in 1975, the organisation was involved within the 'Yes' campaign.

Other campaigns since then have included pressing for direct elections to the [[European Parliament]] in the 1970s and promoting the benefits of the [[single market]] in the run-up to 1992. 

It campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum and continues to oppose [[Brexit]] in collaboration with other major pro-European campaign groups such as [[Open Britain]] and Britain for Europe. 

In February 2018 [[George Soros]]'s [[Open Society Foundations]] donated £500,000 to a number of groups opposing Brexit including £182,000 to European Movement UK.&lt;ref name="Guardian_182"&gt;{{cite news | last = Elgot | first = Jessica | title = George Soros raises donation to anti-Brexit Best for Britain group | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/11/george-soros-best-for-britain-pro-eu-100000 | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 11 February 2018 | access-date = 24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April the same year the group joined the [[People's Vote]] to campaign for a second vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Porritt | first = Richard | title = Campaign launched to push for People’s Vote | url = http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/second-brexit-vote-campaign-launch-1-5476745 | work = [[The New European]] | date = 15 April 2018 | access-date = 17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Launch of the new national People’s Vote campaign | url = https://www.open-britain.co.uk/launch_of_the_new_national_people_s_vote_campaign | website = open-britain.co.uk | publisher = [[Open Britain]] | date = 15 April 2018 | access-date = 17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hereditary dictatorship''', or '''family dictatorship''', in political science terms a '''personalistic regime''', is a form of [[dictatorship]] that occurs in a nominally or formally [[republic]]an or [[Socialism|socialist]] regime, but operates in practice like an [[absolute monarchy]] or [[Despotism|despotate]], in that political power passes within the dictator's family. Thus, although the key leader is often called [[president]] or [[prime minister]] rather than a [[king]] or [[emperor]], power is transmitted between members of the same family due to the overwhelming authority of the leader. Sometimes the leader has been declared [[president for life]] and uses this power to nominate one of his or her family as successor.

A family dictatorship is different from a [[monarchy]] (where the descent is required by general constitutional law), or a [[political family]] (where members of the family possess informal, rather than formal and overwhelming political authority).

==Distinguishing features==
A family dictatorship is different from an absolute monarchy, and the ruler does not usually base his or her authority on the concept of [[divine right of kings|divine right]]. In the latter, the transition of power within a family is required by general law as part of the state's constitutional arrangement, and continues to apply to all successions in the regime. In the former, this arrangement is not required by general law. In some cases, a special law might be enacted to formally nominate one particular family member of the present leader as the successor. In other cases, the law of the state may even formally provide for elections, but control exerted by the leader on the political and electoral process ensures a hereditary succession. Furthermore, whether each succession succeeds depends on the level of authority and control of the leader. As a result, modern family dictatorships often transition into a non-familial (non-personalistic) regime after a small number of successions: usually just one, and rarely more than two.

A family dictatorship is also different from other [[political family|political families]]. In the latter, informal power and influence accrued to the family enables the family to continue to hold political power, often through open and contested elections. In the former, the family uses either formal legal or political power or control to ensure a familial succession, and usually via a controlled or uncontested election, or no election at all.

Because a family dictatorship exerts significant control on its succession, a successor is often determined well in advance. However, because it often lacks a formal general law basis for the succession, there are often long periods of uncertainty as to the identity of the successor. As often happens in other types of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes which plan their own succession, after a successor is determined or short-listed, they often go through a significant period of "grooming", in which the successor gains the experiences and qualifications aimed to make him or her attain the authority necessary to lead the regime.

==Successful transitions of power==

Dates in parentheses denote the period of rule.
&lt;!-- Please sort this list by the start of the first ruling period --&gt;
===Europe===
* [[Roman Republic]]: [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] (49–44 BCE) succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted son [[Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]]  (44–27 BCE).
* [[Roman Empire]]: The early dynasties of the Roman Empire operated similarly to a family dictatorship. [[Augustus]] (27 BCE–14 CE) kept up the facade of a republic during his reign but designated his own successor, [[Tiberius]], by adopting Tiberius and convincing the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to transfer his powers to Tiberius (14 CE–37 CE) upon his death. For three hundred years, subsequent emperors customarily designated their successor by adoption. From the reign of [[Diocletian]] (284–305) onwards, emperors ruled in an openly monarchic style.
* [[Dutch Republic]]: [[Stadtholder|Stadtholders]] were chosen exclusively from the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. In all, nine princes of this dynasty ruled the Republic from 1559 to 1795. Stadtholders were described as dictators by [[William Aglionby]] in his 1669 book, ''The Present State of the United Provinces of the Low-Countries''.&lt;ref&gt;Aglionby, William A. (1669), ''[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A26549.0001.001?view=toc The Present State of the United Provinces of the Low-Countries]''. John Starkey.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CCL5 072.jpg|thumb|The flag of the Arab revolt- Aqaba 2006]] 
The '''Flag of the Arab Revolt''' also known as the [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Flag of Hejaz]] was a [[flag]] used by the [[Arab nationalists]] during the [[Arab Revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]].

==History==
[[File:030Arab.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers in the Arab Army during the Arab Revolt of 1916–1918. They are carrying the flag of the Arab Revolt and are pictured in the Arabian Desert.]]

The flag was designed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat Sir [[Mark Sykes]], in an effort to create a feeling of "Arab-ness" in order to fuel the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;William Easterly, ''The White Man's Burden'' (2006), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Arab Revolt was only very limited in scope and concerted by the British rather than by Arabs themselves, the flag influenced the [[national flags]] of a number of emerging [[Arab World|Arab states]] after World War I. Flags inspired by that of the Arab revolt include those of [[Flag of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Flag of Jordan|Jordan]], [[Flag of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Flag of Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[Flag of Sudan|Sudan]], [[Flag of Syria|Syria]], the [[Flag of the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Flag of Yemen|Yemen]], [[Palestinian flag|Palestine]], [[Flag of Somaliland|Somaliland]], the [[Flag of Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] and [[Flag of Libya|Libya]].

The horizontal colors stand for the [[Abbasid]] (black), [[Umayyad]] (white) and [[Fatimid]] (green) [[Caliphates]]. The red triangle refers to the [[Hashemite]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Midura, [https://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197802/flags.of.the.arab.world.htm "Flags of the Arab World"], in ''Saudi Aramco World'', March/April 1978, pages 4–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, [http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/meaning_of_flag.htm "Palestine Facts: The Meaning of the Flag"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222200644/http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/meaning_of_flag.htm |date=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, the colours' symbolism has been described as follows: white for the Damascene [[Umayyad]] period, green for the [[Caliph Ali]], red for the [[Khawarij]] radical Islamic movement, and black for the [[Prophet Mohammed]], showing the "political use of religion" in opposition to the increasingly secularized Turkish colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Sergie, Lina, ''[https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/70372 Recollecting history : songs, flags and a Syrian square]'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Architecture, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hashemites were allies of the British in the conflict against the Ottoman Empire. After the war ended, the Hashemites achieved or were granted rule in the [[Hejaz]] region of [[Arabia]], [[Jordan]], formally known as the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan'', briefly in [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Greater Syria]], and [[Iraq]]. 

Greater Syria was dissolved after only a few months of existence, in 1920. The Hashemites were overthrown in the Hejaz in 1925 by the [[House of Saud]], and in Iraq in 1958 by a [[coup d'etat]], but retained power in [[Jordan]].

A 60 m × 30 m version of the flag currently flies from the [[Aqaba Flagpole]], currently the sixth tallest freestanding [[flagpole]] in the world, located in [[Aqaba]], [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.andrewcusack.com/2016/arab-revolt-flag/ |title=The Flag of the Arab Revolt |publisher=andrewcusack.com |access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The [[flag]] contains the four [[Pan-Arab colors]]: [[black]], [[white]], [[green]] and [[red]]. There are three horizontal stripes: black, green, and white, going down the flag. There is also a red triangle on the hoist side of the flag.

== History and Key Work==
Founded in 2014, the Geneva Water Hub, with offices at the [[University of Geneva]] and the [[World Meteorological Organization]], works to bridge the gap between water research, policy and practice on the ground - often at cross boundary and [[River Basin|river basin]] scale. 

From 2015 until 2017 it acted as the Secretariat to the [[Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace|Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace]] and now acts as the secretariat for the Group of Friends for Water and Peace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genevawaterhub.org/platforms/group-friends-water-and-peace|title=Group of Friends on Water and Peace {{!}} Geneva Water Hub|website=www.genevawaterhub.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, about forty countries represented by their Permanent Missions to the United Nations in Geneva&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-63865.html|title=“Transforming water into a source of cooperation and peace”|last=Council|first=The Federal|website=www.admin.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It also coordinates the Universities Partnership for Water Cooperation and Diplomacy, launched at the 2018 [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos|Davos, Switzerland]] with IHE Delft Institute for Water Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un-ihe.org/|title=Home {{!}} IHE Delft Institute for Water Education|website=www.un-ihe.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iitg.ac.in/|title=Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati|website=www.iitg.ac.in|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the German-Kazakh University in Almaty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/v/iwm-network/partners/Kazakh-German_University/index.html|title=Kazakh-German University|date=2013-08-30|website=www.geo.fu-berlin.de|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Oregon State University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gradwater.oregonstate.edu/|title=Water Resources Graduate Program|website=Water Resources Graduate Program|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This university consortium was established to encourage dialogue and capacity-building between countries and among different professional sectors.  

=== Water and Peace  ===
In 2015, the World Economic Forum ranked [[water scarcity]] as the largest global risk over the next decade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/01/why-world-water-crises-are-a-top-global-risk/|title=Water crises are a top global risk|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Already, 40% of the world's population is affected by water scarcity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/17825HLPW_Outcome.pdf|title=Making Every Drop Count|last=Water|first=High Level Panel on|date=14 March 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a planet where more than 260 international rivers cross many man-made boundaries. In addition, more than half the planet's [[Wetland|wetlands]] have disappeared&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwf.panda.org/?322330/Half-of-the-worlds-wetlands-have-disappeared-since-1900|title=Half of the world's wetlands have disappeared since 1900!|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[climate change]] is impacting weather and water patterns around the world.  

Yet, as the dialogue of ‘water wars’ increases, research shows that water is far more a tool for cooperation and peace than conflict. During the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century there were only seven minor confrontations over water, with 145 treaties signed in the same 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Aaron T.|date=2007-11-01|title=Shared Waters: Conflict and Cooperation|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.energy.32.041006.101434|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=241–269|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.32.041006.101434|issn=1543-5938|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through academic research, policy and hydro-diplomacy the Geneva Water Hub works to shift the global dialogue from ‘[[Water conflict|water and conflict]]’ to ‘water for peace and cooperation’, to deliver better water governance and the long-term protection of critical water resources and infrastructure.  

=== Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace ===
In 2015, the Geneva Water Hub began working as Secretariat to the [[Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace|Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace]] – a 15 country co-convened initiative focused on strengthening the global framework to prevent and resolve water-related conflicts and to facilitate the use of water as an instrument of peace and cooperation&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwater.org/report-global-high-level-panel-water-peace/|title=Report of the Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace {{!}} UN-Water|date=2017-09-18|work=UN-Water|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In its 2017 report “A Matter of Survival”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/world/matter-survival-report-global-high-level-panel-water-and-peace|title=A Matter of Survival - Report of the Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace - World|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace outlined its recommendations for a fundamental rethinking of international water cooperation from the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] to other multilateral institutions and down to grass-roots level organisations.

=== Water Governance Education  ===
At the University of Geneva, the Geneva Water Hub runs an annual Summer School in Water Governance and a distance learning course on International Water Law and the Law of Transboundary Aquifers. It also offers several open access [[Massive open online course|Massive Online Open Courses]] for water technicians and the water policy community on topics such as water resources policy and management, international water law and [[ecosystem services]].

'''''Hammer &amp; Tickle: The Communist Joke Book''''' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] about the nature of [[Russian political joke]]s under the powerful and socially restrictive [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist regime]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Satellite state#Soviet satellite states|satellite nations]].  The film's name exemplifies the kind of mockery or criticism of the regime that the Soviet government would have found to be disagreeable by playing on the [[Communist symbolism|symbol of communism]] itself, the [[hammer and sickle]].  The film tells the story of the power that jokes had to enable social and political change and advance personal freedoms from within the USSR - the film's opening scene uses a quote from [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'': "Every joke is a tiny revolution."

==Content==
Under the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|watchful eyes]] of the oppressive Soviet government, the Russian people had very few outlets in which they could publicly express their disapproval of their government and its policies.  The film shows the story of how jokes served as an outlet for the people's expression of their desire for reform and freedom.  These jokes were often told quietly to one another, as to avoid retribution from the Soviet [[secret police]] agencies who kept a close eye on such expressions of [[Civil disobedience|political dissent]]. Oftentimes, however, even private and seemingly benign displays of such dissent couldn't escape detection. Eva Kovacs of the Secret Police Archives in Hungary tells the story of a university student who spent two years in prison and had all his possessions confiscated after telling an unseemly joke about [[Mátyás Rákosi|Comrade Rákosi]].

In an interview with Ilie Merce ([[:ro:Ilie Merce|ro]]), former Colonel of the [[Communist Romania]]n secret police agency [[Securitate]], Merce says that his agency paid particular attention to jokes about the lack of availability of basic products and the censorship of television, as they "functioned as indicators of the spirit of the people."

On several occasions, the film shows [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] poking fun at the Soviet Union's shortcomings, highlighting how he too used humor to sway public opinion.

==Reception==
''Hammer &amp; Tickle'' premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in 2006 to positive reviews,&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Martha|title=Tribeca Review: Hammer &amp; Tickle -- The Communist Joke Book|url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2006/04/10/tribeca-review-hammer-and-tickle-the-communist-joke-book/|accessdate=28 November 2011|publisher=[[Moviefone]]|date=10 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the title of "Best Documentary" at the [[Zurich Film Festival]] later that year.&lt;ref name="Lewis Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammerandtickle.com/?cat=3|title=Ben Lewis Biography|year=2011|work=Hammer and Tickle|accessdate=30 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318055521/http://www.hammerandtickle.com/?cat=3|archivedate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Martin Sutermeister''' (29 September 1907  – 4 May 1977 pen name: Hans Moehrlen) was a [[Swiss]] [[physician]] and [[medical writer]], [[politician]], and activist against [[Miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]].

==Life==

===Early years===
Hans Martin was born to Freidrich Sutermeister (1873-1934) and Maria Hunziker (1875-1947). His brothers include the writer [[Peter Sutermeister|Peter]] and composer [[Heinrich Sutermeister|Heinrich]].  His grandfather was the folklorist [[Otto Sutermeister]]. A minister's son, Hans Martin studied [[theology]] in Germany, changing to medicine at [[University of Basel]] just before completing his degree.&lt;ref name=Mauz&gt;Gerhard Mauz. [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46272426.html “Schuldig, weil wir keinen anderen haben: SPIEGEL-Reporter Gerhard Mauz über die Fehlurteilsjäger Hans Martin Sutermeister und Gustav Adolf Neumann.”] In: ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 18/28, April 1965, p. 116 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; After his [[Doctorate|promotion]] with his uncle [[Hans Hunziker]] in 1941, Sutermeister published, under the pseudonym “Hans Moehrlen” (following the surname of his great-grandfather [[Christophe Moehrlen]]), an autobiographical novella about his life as a [[bachelor]]. The novella describes his philosophical change of direction towards a [[monism|monist]] view of love and happiness, inspired by natural science; remarkably is its heartedness in times of [[World War II|war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, Sutermeister published a series on [[neopositivism|neopositivist]] medical thought. He was especially interested in [[psychosomatic]] medicine and [[music psychology]]. For example, according to him, “[[swing music]] is restful” because &lt;blockquote&gt;the brain becomes fatigued when it is worked too hard, as in acquiring knowledge of new facts. Both students and business men can benefit by such music … the best way to rest the brain after such fatigue is to “[[Regression (psychology)|regress]]” to more basic or primitive forms of thought and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=efUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=%22Dr.+H+M+Sutermeister%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NgZNnKKMrS&amp;sig=CZX48jDsCLA85cDWrtf2CTnK3wA&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=tNzBTKzPE8KaOtT9yMoL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dr.%20H%20M%20Sutermeister%22&amp;f=false “Swiss Says Swing Smoothly Soothes.”] In: ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', January 17, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During [[World War II]], he worked for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] in Germany, [[Poland]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], as well as a physician at the Swiss border. After the war he wrote for medical journals and was an instructor in [[psychophysiology]] at the [[Volkshochschule]] (Folk high school) in [[Bern]]. In 1945, he opened his first a [[family medicine|family medical]] practice in Bern.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In order to get a [[venia legendi]] in [[History of Medicine]] and [[Medical Psychology]] (Psychosomatics), Sutermeister successively deposited, at the beginning of the 1950s, three [[Habilitation|post-doctoral theses]] at the Medical Faculty of the [[University of Berne]]:&lt;ref name="klaesi"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/JakobKlaesiToBernhardWalthard6.9.1954 ''Betrifft Habilitationsgesuch des Dr. med.

Sutermeister was in contact with the medical historian [[Erich Hintzsche]] particularly because of his work ''Schiller as physician'', and he participated in a seminar on medical history 1953 in Lugano. In a letter to Hintzsche, [[Henry E. Sigerist]] described Sutermeister's review, published in 1955 as Volume 13 of the ''Berne contributions to the history of medicine and natural sciences'', as “a very nice work … that is interesting even to [[literary historian]]s.”&lt;ref name="bickel"&gt;[[Marcel H.

Pages 378 and 572–574. {{ISBN|978-3-03911-499-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessor [[Jakob Klaesi]] recommended to the Dean of the Faculty [[Bernhard Walthard]] to allow Sutermeister's habilitation allow for the government to issue Sutermeister's habilitation as a lecturer in Medicine history and Psychosomatic medicine.&lt;ref name="klaesi" /&gt; Hintzsche, however, who decided jointly, rejected his habilitation.&lt;ref name="bickel" /&gt;

===Politics===

He joined the [[Ring of Independents]] political party and began his political career in the [[Grand Council of Bern|legislature of the Canton of Bern]]. From 1967 to 1971 he served as a member of the municipal [[Executive (government)|executive]], as well as director of the city's schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bähler |first=Anna |author2=Bühler, Susanna |author3=Erne, Emil |author4=Lüthi, Christian |editor=Barth, Robert |title=Bern - die Geschichte der Stadt im 19. und 20.

Although he had a reputation as a progressive within his party, he also stirred some concern both inside and outside the party&lt;ref name=anneepolitique&gt;[http://www.anneepolitique.ch/APS/fr/APS_1971/APS1971_I_1_e.html Élections communales, année politique Suisse 1971], University of Bern (French - password required): ''A Berne, lors des élections à l'exécutif communal, les radicaux, grâce à A.

''[[Der Spiegel]]'' quoted his warning to all educators: &lt;blockquote&gt;We will not permit our youth, who are today still healthy, and our freedom-based Western culture, to be undermined by such softening-up tactics, which are clearly controlled from the East, and made 'Ready for conquest' by Communism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44943670.html “Der SPIEGEL berichtete: Schüler-Lehrerbeziehung.”] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 28/1970, July 6, 1970: ''Wir lassen uns unsre heute noch gesunde Jugend und unsre freiheitliche westliche Kultur nicht durch solche eindeutig vom Osten gesteuerte Aufweichungstaktik unterminieren und “sturmreif” für den Kommunismus machen.''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and added that some schools banned the book; Radio Bern canceled a broadcast on it; and bookstores canceled orders; the city authorities determined that the book was not seditious, but with police assurance that they had the power to do so, banned it as posing a danger to minors. His actions revealed latent attitudinal and generational divisions within the party, and he was not re-elected in 1971.&lt;ref name=anneepolitique/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.memoriav.ch/memobase/search/detail.aspx?docid=RJSFDRS_93077691&amp;startrank=1&amp;rankcount=9726 see also]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he opened his new family medical practice in Basel.

===Activism against miscarriages of justice===

[[File:Hans Martin Sutermeister 1971.jpg|thumb|upright|Of the [[Swiss Posters Collection]]: Sutermeister's election poster for the Bernese [[Gemeinderat (Bern)|Gemeinderat]], 1971.]]

In the 1960s, Sutermeister became interested in [[forensic pathology]], and began to involve himself in investigating and attempting to right miscarriages of justice. He traveled widely and wrote analyses on false recognition, intimidation by prison inmates, uncritical acceptance of expert testimony, suggestibility and emotionalism in jurors and psychological errors by judges. His book ''Summa Iniuria'', which treats hundreds of cases, is one of the most thorough German-language works in the field. He concerned himself particularly with the case of [[Jaccoud case|Pierre Jaccoud]], whom he was convinced had been wrongly convicted of murdering Charles Zumbach based on faulty forensic work. At one point Pierre Hegg, the head of the police criminological laboratory, sued him for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-43067286.html "Ein gewisses Lächeln"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 45/1960, 2 November 1960, p. 71 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts on behalf of Jaccoud made him a prominent and effective opponent of courtroom injustice,&lt;ref name=Mauz/&gt; and he went so far as to assemble the funds to hire Horace Mastronardi and other lawyers to appeal Jaccoud's conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Thorwald]], ''Blutiges Geheimnis'', Munich: Droemer Knaur, 1969, {{OCLC|159809005}}, pp. 257-58 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his efforts, the case was never reopened.

The criminal law expert [[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]] puts Sutermeister's ''Summa iniuria'' in the context of the earlier works of [[Erich Sello]], [[Max Alsberg]], [[Albert Hellwig]], [[Max Hirschberg]] and [[Heinrich Jagusch]] and considers him as a "committed fighters for a constitutionally protected Criminal Justice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]].

== Bibliography ==
{{Cleanup|section|reason=totally exagerrated list of published items|date=December 2016}} 
The '''bibliography of Hans Martin Sutermeister''' includes a fictional novel and around 150 scientific articles, essays and books, some of them [[Investigative journalism]] written by the Swiss writer Hans Martin Sutermeister, pen name Hans Moehrlen (1907–1977). Sutermeister was a prolific writer on topics related to [[psychosomatic medicine]], [[music psychology]] and [[history of medicine]] as well as contemporary Swiss society and cultural criticism, whom [[Karl Peters (jurist)|Karl Peters]] in 2008 declared "a fierce fighter for justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Peters | first = Karl | authorlink = Karl Peters (jurist) | title = Justiz als Schicksal: ein Plädoyer für die andere Seite | publisher = [[De Gruyter]] | year = 1979 | location = Berlin | pages = 192 | language = German | isbn =978-2-01-005712-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutermeister is best remembered for his contradictory political as a both-left-and-rightwing libertarian-authoritarian presence in local media. Every line of work that he has written since 1942 seeming, directly or indirectly, in favour of a [[monism|monist]] [[Weltanschauung|worldview]]. To that end, Sutermeister used his scientific writing to defend his political convictions, as shown in several book reviews. He first achieved acclaim with his non–fictional books from ''Psychologie und Weltanschauung'' (1944) to ''Schiller als Arzt'' (1955) and cemented his place in local history as one of the greatest Swiss pamphletists with the publication of ''[[Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrtümer]]'' shortly before his death.

Sutermeister wrote non-fiction—including book reviews, editorials, and investigative journalism—for a variety of Swiss periodicals, mainly [[Public health journal|medical journals]]. He particularly wrote a book-length investigation of [[comprehensive school]]s in Switzerland and another of [[miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]] in the form of ''[[Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrtümer]]'', a retrospective of criminal justice mainly in Switzerland and Germany.

No attempts have been made until now to comprehensively collect the entirety of his miscellany.

=== Books ===
Sutermeister composed one novel, ''Zwischen zwei Welten'', which is autobiographical; it was inspired by his period working as a student during [[Second World War|wartime]]; it records his experiences living and [[wikt:tramping|tramping]] in a town where he later finished his medical studies; the names are partially fictionalized:

=== Articles ===
Sutermeister wrote dozens of essays and book reviews. His insights into [[history of medicine]], literature, and politics (defending in particular [[anti-fascist]], [[liberal socialist]], [[freethought]] and somehow [[anti-communist]] ideas) during the following years. Since his death, many essays have disappeared, with the first attempt at a comprehensive collection being this list. Some of his essays, mainly during his time as member of the [[Ring of Independents]] political party, took the form of [[pamphlet]]s and were published and distributed (by himself) independently.

The following list contains the articles which are both registered in [[PubMed]] and can be considered as outstanding because of their scope, theme range or length:

Paris: [[UNESCO]], 1961, p. 70.&lt;ref&gt;„The  film is here considered as an aid to a healthier emotional life.  The  cinema in the school and for the people at large is a form of collective therapy, but it constitutes a certain danger for adolescents who are particularly suggestible without having sufficient experience to serve as a counterweight. It is perhaps not so much the erotic element in the movies which is dangerous, but rather the illusions which they foster of social ascension without effort, and the glorification of idleness and of the easy life.“&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other cultural manifestation===

As a member of the so–called bernese [[nonconformist]]s, Sutermeister spoke in the [[Junkere 37]] (sometimes called [[Speakers' Corner]] of [[Bern]]). Some fragments of these manifestations are traceable in the ''Nonkonformismus Archiv Fredi Lerch''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukas Dettwiler (creator of the inventary): [http://ead.nb.admin.ch/images/lerch/Personen.xml Short biography of Hans Martin Sutermeister] in the „Nonkonformismus Archiv [[Fredi Lerch]].“ [[Swiss Literary Archives]], 2011, with links to the ''Junkere 37'' sources.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Schulreform: Beobachtungen des städtischen Schuldirektors im Ausland.'' Bernese newspaper article, spring 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Sutermeister was not known for his [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] work, he did compose two “little [[waltz]]” and a poem:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2892">In German-speaking countries, '''Hauptwohnsitz''' ({{lang-en|Main domicile}}) denotes the primary place of residence. In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], the concept of Hauptwohnsitz has special legal ramifications, primarily involving [[tax]].

In [[Austria]] the Hauptwohnsitz&lt;ref name="hws-oe"&gt;[http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/99/Seite.990076.html help.gv.at - ''Hauptwohnsitz''] (German language), accessed 10 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; has an important meaning in the context of [[finance|financial]] adjustment between the [[Government of Austria|federation]] and the local [[municipality|municipalities]].  On the basis of the [[census]] determined number of inhabitants with Hauptwohnsitz, the municipality receives its budget from the federal government.  Hauptwohnsitze count themselves for a municipality in two regards: By the direct payment per head, and an increase in premiums after exceeding certain thresholds for the number of inhabitants.  This leads to frequent censuses to match the budget of a municipality to its number of inhabitants. In fact, many municipalities are negatively affected by this system. The city of [[Graz]], Austria's second largest city, counts about  260,000 registered Hauptwohnsitze, however, almost 300,000 people do have their main residence there, as there are many students still having their Hauptwohnsitz registered in their hometowns. Since those are not taken into account concerning fiscal distribution, Graz faces serious economic problems. Currently there are campaigns trying to motivate students having their Hauptwohnsitz registered there.

The Hauptwohnsitz in [[Germany]] is based on the main center of ones' interest (''Lebensmittelpunkt'').&lt;ref name="mrrg"&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/mrrg/ ''Melderechtsrahmengesetz''] (German language), § 12 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hauptwohnsitz is also the place in which one exercises the right to [[Elections in Germany|vote]], and where the [[Municipalities_of_Germany|municipal administration]] issues a citizen's [[German identity card|ID card]] and [[German passport|passport]]. The income tax revenue is split between the federal government, the [[States of Germany|Land]] government and the municipality where the respective taxpayer has their ''Hauptwohnsitz''. Apart from the ''Hauptwohnsitz'' a person can establish multiple secondary places of residence (''Nebenwohnsitze'', sg. ''Nebenwohnsitz'') where they are also registered as residents but do not have a right to vote. A number of German municipalities impose a secondary-residence tax (''Zweitwohnungssteuer'') on persons having such a secondary residence, the rationale for that being that they have to provide services to these persons but do not share in their income tax.

'''Hegewald''' was a short-lived German colony during [[World War II]], situated near [[Zhytomyr]] in [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]. It was repopulated in late 1942 and early 1943 by the ethnically German settlers classified as ''[[Volksdeutsche]]''; transferred from occupied territories of Poland, Croatia, Bessarabia, and the Soviet Union to an area earmarked for the projected [[Germanization]] of the Ukrainian lands. The plans were prepared months in advance by the [[SS]], [[RKFDV]] and [[VoMi]], but major problems with supplies occurred right from the region's initial establishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn H. Nicholas]], ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' [https://books.google.ca/books?id=PeUKT6d9khIC&amp;lpg=PT474&amp;vq=Hegewald&amp;pg=PT473#v=snippet&amp;q=Hegewald&amp;f=false pp. 336, 473], {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s original plans to recruit settlers from Scandinavia and the Netherlands were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn H. Nicholas]], ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' p 330-1, {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The initial plans were difficult to implement for a number of reasons including the reluctance and fear among many ''Volksdeutsche'' owing to partisan activities in the area. Elaborate guidelines were set up to prepare the locations.&lt;ref name="cruel331"&gt;Nicholas, pp. 331, 474.&lt;/ref&gt; The new settlers were to receive the homes of killed or evicted Ukrainian peasants, as well as their furniture, livestock, and food, and schools were to be built.&lt;ref name="cruel331"/&gt; This required a massive deportation effort, mostly on foot.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p 331-2&lt;/ref&gt; Most homes were in terrible shape by German standards. There was a considerable shortage of lumber, and general lack of winter clothing and shoes.&lt;ref name="cruel474"&gt;Nicholas, p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ukrainian and Polish Germans did arrive on trains, having been forcibly removed from their homes, to be doled out plots of land and informed of their quotas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heather Pringle]], ''[http://www.historynet.com/heinrich-himmler-the-nazi-leaders-master-plan.htm/1 Heinrich Himmler: The Nazi Leader's Master Plan]''&lt;/ref&gt; They received use, but not ownership, of the land assigned to them.&lt;ref name="harvest45"&gt;[[Karel C. Berkhoff]], ''Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine Under Nazi Rule'' p 45 {{ISBN|0-674-01313-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the deported Ukrainians nor the ethnic Germans received more than a few hours' notice of their relocation.&lt;ref name="harvest45"/&gt; Despite damage to the houses, most could be made functional before snowfall.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p 336&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate Christmas pageants were set up, deliberately irreligious, to celebrate the return of light and link it to the "dark powers" surrounding Germany, and gifts and food were provided.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p 336-7,&lt;/ref&gt;

All did not go as planned. The intended preparations were undermined by flinching of craftsmen, and neither food nor clothing arrived as promised.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p 338&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many evicted Ukrainians returned to the area.&lt;ref name="cruel339"&gt;Nicholas, p 339&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to continue, with the [[League of German Girls]] members being sent even when they had to receive gas masks and soldier escorts, but by November 1943, the inhabitants were in flight before the Red Army.&lt;ref name="cruel339"/&gt; These were the first of [[Flight and evacuation of German civilians during the end of World War II|massive flights from Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, p 434&lt;/ref&gt;

==Villages==
The colony consisted of 27 villages, all named in German differently from their traditional names; they were situated along the [[Zhytomyr]]-[[Berdychiv]] road. The existing villages of today are in the Ukrainian language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy Lower|Lower, Wendy]]: ''Nazi empire-building and the Holocaust in Ukraine'', p. 176.

The '''International Crisis Group''' ('''ICG'''; also simply known as the '''Crisis Group''') is a transnational [[non-profit]], [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 1995 that carries out field research on violent conflict and advances policies to prevent, mitigate or resolve conflict. It advocates policies directly with governments, multilateral organisations and other political actors as well as the media.&lt;ref&gt;"It is not a campaign organization in the familiar grass-roots, or now social-media sense, but it is certainly a high-level advocacy one, seeking constantly to communicate directly with government policymakers and those who influence them, and with a strong media profile." - [http://www.gevans.org/speeches/speech471.html The International Crisis Group: The Role of a Global NGO in Preventing and Resolving Deadly Conflict], Gareth Evans, 17 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Destexhe was succeeded in September 2014 by [[Jean-Marie Guéhenno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.challengesforum.org/en/About/News/International-Crisis-Group-announces-next-President--CEO-Jean-Marie-Guehenno/|title=International Crisis Group announces next President &amp; CEO Jean-Marie Guéhenno|website=Challenges Forum|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018 [[Robert Malley]], became President and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/robert-malley-0|title=Robert Malley|date=2017-04-14|work=Crisis Group|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICG garnered controversy in April 2013 as it awarded Myanmar President [[Thein Sein]] its "In Pursuit of Peace Award", with the award ceremony coinciding with the publication of a [[Human Rights Watch]] report of ethnic cleansing by Sein's administration.&lt;ref name="ATimes"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/SEA-01-220413.html |title=Conflicted Peace Prize for Thein Sein |author=William Corliss |publisher=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;

==Criticism==
Gareth Evans, president and CEO of the International Crisis Group for nine years and former foreign minister of Australia, officially recognized East Timor as a province of Indonesia, a decade after the dictatorship invaded and carried out a "genocide" of the East Timorese in 1991, killing 200,000, according to a report co-sponsored by the Australian Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydneypeacefoundation.org.au/2011-city-of-sydney-peace-prize-lecture-by-prof-noam-chomsky/|title=2011 City of Sydney Peace Prize Lecture by Prof Noam Chomsky|work=Sydneypeacefoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans described the massacre by the Indonesian Army as an "aberration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://johnpilger.com/articles/east-timor-a-lesson-in-why-the-poorest-threaten-the-powerful |title=East Timor: a lesson in why the poorest threaten the powerful |date=5 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017043430/http://johnpilger.com/articles/east-timor-a-lesson-in-why-the-poorest-threaten-the-powerful |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A July 2014 special edition of the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Third World Quarterly]]'' published 10 critiques of the organisation, ranging from it's influence on foreign-policy makers, "manufacturing" crises, and the methodologies it deploys in gathering its research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ctwq20/35/4#.U-KNSYBdWRE Knowledge Production in Conflict: the International Crisis Group] Third World Quarterly, 2014, Volume 35, Issue 4, pages 545-722.

==Organization==
===Funding===
A January 1995 meeting in London brought many international figures together, and approved a proposal for an annual budget of $8m and 75 full-time staff. In mid-1995 it was formally registered in the US as a tax-exempt non-profit organisation.&lt;ref name="ICG15"&gt;ICG, [http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/misc/crisisgroup-15years.ashx Fifteen Years on the Front Lines, 1995-2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313110057/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/misc/crisisgroup-15years.ashx |date=2013-03-13 }}. pp. 10-27.&lt;/ref&gt;From 1996 to 1999, Crisis Group had an annual budget of around $2m and around 20 full-time staff; by 2008 its budget was $15m.&lt;ref name=ICG15/&gt; By 2017 its budget had risen to over $17 million. Crisis Group receives funding under grants from governments, charitable foundations, private companies and individual donors. In 2017, it received 43% of its funding from governments, 28% from charitable foundations, 22% from the private sector, 3% from investment income, 3% from other sources and 2% from program service revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d2071andvip0wj.cloudfront.net/ICG%202017%20FS.pdf|title=International Crisis Group 2016 Financial Statement |last=|first=|date=June 30, 2017 |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}} Independent auditor: Gelman, Rosenberg &amp; Feldman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Di Pietro]] was [[Italian Minister of Public Works|minister of Public Works]] in the [[Prodi I Cabinet]] from May to November 1996, when he resigned because he was under investigation in [[Brescia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/novembre/15/Ora_basta_Pietro_lascia_governo_co_0_9611156464.shtml |title=" Ora basta " : Di Pietro lascia il governo |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1997 Di Pietro was elected senator for [[The Olive Tree (Italy)|The Olive Tree]] in a by-election in [[Mugello]], a stronghold of the [[Democrats of the Left]] (DS) in [[Tuscany]], with 67.7% of the vote, much more than [[Centre-right coalition|centre-right]] independent [[Giuliano Ferrara]] (16.1%) and [[Communist Refoundation Party|Communist]] [[Sandro Curzi]] (13.0%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/novembre/10/Pietro_supera_Ferrara_fermo_16_co_0_9711105269.shtml |title=Di Pietro supera il 67 %, Ferrara fermo al 16 |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1998 Di Pietro established his party, '''Italy of Values''' (IdV), alongside [[Willer Bordon]] of the [[Democratic Union (Italy)|Democratic Union]] and [[Rino Piscitello]] and [[Franco Danieli]] of [[The Network (political party)|The Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/marzo/22/Pietro_nasce_Italia_dei_Valori_co_0_98032213938.shtml |title=Di Pietro, nasce l' " Italia dei Valori " |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Leoluca Orlando]] (a future IdV member).

In February 1999 Di Pietro integrated IdV into [[The Democrats (Italy)|The Democrats]], a new centrist party founded by [[Romano Prodi]] with the goal of  transforming The Olive Tree coalition in a single "Democratic" party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1999/febbraio/28/Democratici_scelgono_asinello_co_0_9902282547.shtml |title=I Democratici scelgono un asinello |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Italy)|1999 European Parliament election]] The Democrats scored 7.7% and Di Pietro was elected [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]. He was also appointed organisational secretary and [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]] floor leader of the party. In April 2000, however, Di Pietro abruptly left in opposition to the appointment of [[Giuliano Amato]], a long-time member of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (which was the main subject of investigation of Di Pietro as prosecutor), as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] after the resignation of [[Massimo D'Alema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2000/aprile/28/Democratici_Pietro_sbatte_porta_co_0_0004281876.shtml |title=Democratici, Di Pietro sbatte la porta |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Di Pietro set up IdV again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2000/maggio/23/Pietro_lancia_movimento_per_correre_co_0_0005238269.shtml |title=Di Pietro lancia un movimento per correre alle politiche |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IdV took part to the [[Italian general election, 2001|2001 general election]] as a stand-alone party on a [[populism|populist]] platform, which included tough management of [[illegal immigration]] and protest against waste of public money. IdV's campaign was focused principally against [[Silvio Berlusconi]], who was the candidate for Prime Minister of the [[House of Freedoms]] (CdL) centre-right coalition. IdV won 3.9% in the election, 0.1% short of the 4% threshold, and obtained no seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]]. The party elected one senator, [[Valerio Carrara]], but, after a few days from the election, he surprisingly switched to Berlusconi's [[Forza Italia]] (FI) party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/maggio/31/Carrara_passa_con_Forza_Italia_co_0_0105316479.shtml|title=Carrara passa con Forza Italia. L' ex pm: è un piccolo uomo Primo ribaltone, senatore di Di Pietro con il Polo|date=2001-05-31|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving IdV without parliamentary representation for the next five years.

===From isolation to electoral success (2001–2009)===
In the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Italy)|2004 European Parliament election]] Di Pietro teamed up with [[Achille Occhetto]], a former leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) and the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] (PDS), under the banner "Civil Society Di Pietro–Occhetto". The electoral list gained 2.1% of the national vote and both men were elected [[Members of the European Parliament|MEPs]]. After the election, Occhetto immediately renounced to his seat and was replaced by [[Giulietto Chiesa]], a communist journalist, who sat with the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Party of European Socialists Group]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parlArchives/mepArch/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&amp;id=28973&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 IdV joined [[The Union (Italy)|The Union]], a new centre-left coalition led by Prodi, who won the [[Italian centre-left primary election, 2005|primary election]] with 74.2% of the vote, defeating also Di Pietro (3.3%). In early 2006 [[Leoluca Orlando]], former mayor of [[Palermo]], some splinters from the [[Union of Democrats for Europe]] (UDEUR), including [[Pino Pisicchio]] and [[Egidio Pedrini]], and former DS such as [[Fabio Evangelisti]] and [[Federico Palomba]], joined the party, in an effort of broadening its electoral base.

The Union narrowly won the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]], IdV scored a mere 2.1% and Di Pietro was sworn in as [[Italian Minister of Infrastructures and Transports|Minister of Infrastructures]] in the [[Prodi II Cabinet]].

After the fall of Prodi's government, Di Pietro formed an alliance with the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (PD) for the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general election]]. The coalition was defeated by Berlusconi's [[Centre-right coalition|centre-right]], but IdV obatained 4.4% of the vote, 29 deputies and 14 senators. Following the election, IdV formed its own groups in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, instead of joining the Democrats in a joint group as promised, and started a competition with its main ally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2008/04/24/veltroni-idv-niente-gruppo-unico-braccio-di-ferro.html|title=Veltroni-Idv, niente gruppo unico braccio di ferro sui capigruppo|date=2008-04-24|publisher=[[La Repubblica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfoglio.it/soloqui/1169|title=Il polo Di Pietro|date=2008-10-11|publisher=[[Il Foglio]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014102650/http://www.ilfoglio.it/soloqui/1169|archivedate=14 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008 Veltroni, who distanced from Di Pietro many times, declared that "on some issues he [Di Pietro] is distant from the democratic language of the centre-left",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_ottobre_19/veltroni_fine_alleanza_dipietro_fc8b7390-9dfb-11dd-b589-00144f02aabc.shtml|title=Veltroni: con Di Pietro alleanza finita|date=2008-10-19|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the PD decided to support [[Carlo Costantini]] (IdV) in the [[Abruzzo regional election, 2008|2008 regional election in Abruzzo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asca.it/moddettnews.php?idnews=786879&amp;canale=ORA&amp;articolo=ABRUZZO/ELEZIONI:%20IL%20CENTROSINISTRA%20PUNTA%20TUTTO%20SU%20COSTANTINI%20(IDV) |title=ABRUZZO/ELEZIONI: IL CENTROSINISTRA PUNTA TUTTO SU COSTANTINI (IDV) |date=2008-10-28 |publisher=[[ASCA (news agency)|ASCA]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512103259/http://www.asca.it/moddettnews.php?idnews=786879&amp;canale=ORA&amp;articolo=ABRUZZO%2FELEZIONI%3A%20IL%20CENTROSINISTRA%20PUNTA%20TUTTO%20SU%20COSTANTINI%20%28IDV%29 |archivedate=12 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Costantini was defeated, but in the event IdV came close to the PD (15.0%–19.6%).

In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Italy)|2009 European Parliament election]] the list got 8.0% of the national vote, quadrupling the votes obtained five years before and gaining 7 seats. In the run-up for the election Di Pietro recruited to run in IdV lists [[Pino Arlacchi]], a former senator for the DS, [[Gianni Vattimo]], a left-wing philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Politica/?id=3.0.3165256132|title=Da Gianni Rivera all'ex pm De Magistris, le squadre dei partiti per le Europee|date=2009-04-01|publisher=[[Adnkronos]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurizio Zipponi]], a former trade unionist and deputy of the [[Communist Refoundation Party]] (PRC), and [[Luigi de Magistris (politician)|Luigi de Magistris]], a left-wing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fainotizia.it/2009/04/29/perch%C3%A8-de-magistris-ha-scelto-di-candidarsi-con-litalia-dei-valori-e-non-con-il-pd?reportage=5041978 |title=De Magistris, vecchio compagno del PCI ai tempi di Berlinguer &amp;#124; Fai notizia – il primo sito di giornalismo partecipativo |language=it |publisher=Fainotizia.it |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; former [[prosecutor]] of [[Catanzaro]] who inquired Romano Prodi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/aprile/14/svolta_operaista_Pietro_co_8_090414018.shtml|title=La svolta "operaista" di Di Pietro|date=2009-04-14|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arlacchi, De Magistris and Vattimo were all elected to the European Parliament. From the results of the European election, IdV was the fourth largest party in the country.

Following these results, Di Pietro said that IdV "will remove his name from the symbol of the party, in order to build something larger, more useful and that represents something more important". He also said that "we need to become a great progressive party that supports a proposal for a credible government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=347028 Di Pietro: "Farò io il grande partito che sostituirà i Democratici" - Interni - ilGiornale.it del 28-04-2009&lt;!-- Titolo generato automaticamente --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However the party's executive finally decided not to remove the name of its founder, considering that name still too important for the party.

==="Populist" turn and discontents (2009–2013)===
[[File:Antonio Di Pietro Siena 2010.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Antonio Di Pietro]] in 2010.]]
Since de Magistris's strong showing in the 2009 European election there was talk of an underground row between him and Di Pietro for the leadership of the party. Moreover, as some members of the party were entailed with corruption charges, others like [[Francesco Barbato]] urged Di Pietro to be more earnest in cleaning up the party.&lt;ref name="Corriere 4-11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/novembre/04/dipietristi_Magistris_Cosi_partito_pezzi_co_9_091104001.shtml |title=I dipietristi a de Magistris "Così il partito va in pezzi" |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/novembre/05/partito_personale_Pietro_alle_prese_co_9_091105014.shtml |title=Il "partito personale" di Di Pietro alle prese con la questione morale |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Magistris, keen on aligning the party with the far left and the most radical groups in opposition to Berlusconi, dubbed Di Pietro as too moderate and denounced that the party "risks of becoming the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|DC]] of the third millennium".&lt;ref name="Corriere 10-02"/&gt; While the party's grassroots supported a change of leadership and de Magistris initially did not rule this out,&lt;ref name="Corriere 7-11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/la_sinistra_fa_10_domande_di_pietro/micromega-pietro/10-11-2009/articolo-id=397778-page=0-comments=1 |title=La sinistra fa 10 domande a Di Pietro - Interni - ilGiornale.it del 10-11-2009 |publisher=Ilgiornale.it |date= |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the party's old guard ([[Silvana Mura]],&lt;ref name="Corriere 4-11"/&gt; [[Massimo Donadi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/novembre/14/Magistris_faccia_retromarcia_Oppure_dovra_co_9_091114052.shtml |title=De Magistris faccia retromarcia Oppure dovrà lasciare il partito |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felice Belisario]], [[Luigi Li Gotti]] and [[Leoluca Orlando]]) staunchly defended the leader. Finally an agreement was reached between the two: during the 5–7 February 2010 party congress de Magistris would support Di Pietro in exchange of a leading role in the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/novembre/17/Mossa_Magistris_iscrivo_all_Idv_co_8_091117032.shtml |title=Mossa di De Magistris: mi iscrivo all' Idv e sosterrò Di Pietro |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any event Di Pietro was re-elected as party president unopposed, while de Magistris did not became party secretary as he wanted.&lt;ref name="Corriere 10-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/febbraio/10/Magistris_deluso_volevo_fare_segretario_co_8_100210031.shtml |title=De Magistris deluso: volevo fare il segretario |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/febbraio/08/Pietro_governo_con_nuovi_compagni_co_8_100208027.shtml |title=Di Pietro: al governo con il Pd Sì a nuovi compagni di viaggio |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The populist course taken by the party, that enforced its co-operation with the far left, and the emergence of more "extreme" figures like de Magistris led [[Pino Pisicchio]] and his centrist faction to leave the party in order to join [[Francesco Rutelli]]'s [[Alliance for Italy]] (ApI) in November 2009. While leaving the party along with other three MPs, Pisicchio told the press that lining up IdV in the "antagonist camp" was a departure from its original nature of a "centrist party of liberal-democratic inspiration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asca.it/news-IDV__PISICCHIO__PRESTO_LASCIO_DI_PIETRO__CON_LUI_MISITI__RAZZI_E_ASTORE-872489-ORA-.html |title=Idv Pisicchio Presto Lascio Di Pietro Con Lui Misiti Razzi E Astore – Agenzia Di Stampa Asca |publisher=Asca.it |date=2004-05-26 |accessdate=2010-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716235225/http://www.asca.it/news-IDV__PISICCHIO__PRESTO_LASCIO_DI_PIETRO__CON_LUI_MISITI__RAZZI_E_ASTORE-872489-ORA-.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilriformista.it/stories/Prima%20pagina/121235/ |title=Il Riformista |publisher=Ilriformista.it |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2010-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722035947/http://www.ilriformista.it/stories/Prima%20pagina/121235/ |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giuseppe Astore]], a senator, offered similar views: "De Magistris is too far on the left for me [...].

In early 2011 IdV proposed three [[referendum]]s. Thanks to its activists, the party was able to collect two million signatures among the Italian population in support of these referendums, which were concerned with the abrogation of the so-called "legittimo impedimento" (an Italian law which permits the Prime Minister to postpone potential trials if prosecuted by the judiciary), the abrogation of a law allowing the construction of [[nuclear power|nuclear power plants]] in Italy and the abrogation of a law allowing the [[Water privatization|privatisation of water]] [[water management|management]]. The referendums took place in June 2011 and the "yes" prevailed in all three cases (see [[Italian referendums, 2011]]).

On 30 May 2011 de Magistris was elected [[List of mayors of Naples|mayor of Naples]] by a landslide. The IdV candidate, who had received just 27.5% of the vote in the first round (enough to beat the Democratic candidate off the second round), won a thumping 65.4% of the vote against the centre-right candidate in the run-off. This was a huge success for IdV and its main ally, the [[Federation of the Left]], which together also gained the majority in the municipal council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comunali.interno.it/comunali/amm110515/C0510490.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518160512/http://comunali.interno.it/comunali/amm110515/C0510490.htm |archivedate=18 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May 2012 the party had another major electoral breakthrough when [[Leoluca Orlando]] was elected [[List of mayors of Palermo|mayor of Palermo]] with 72.4% of the vote in a run-off.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corriere.it/Speciali/Politica/2012/elezioni12/SEAS/amministrative/comunali/comune_PALERMO.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Both mayors would distance from IdV in a few years.

In October 2012 IdV came under pressure after some news inquiries reported obscurities in party finances, while suffering heavy losses in opinion polls due to the success of a new protest party led by comedian [[Beppe Grillo]], the [[Five Star Movement]] (M5S). In an interview to ''[[Il Fatto Quotidiano]]'', Di Pietro declared IdV "dead" and, foreseeing its exclusion from Parliament after the next election, stated that the party would fight from the outside and would endorse the M5S.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/11/01/di-pietro-litalia-dei-valori-e-morto-con-report-ora-risorgiamo/400595/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/novembre/02/Pietro_noi_finiti_tiferemo_Grillo_co_0_20121102_c883e70e-24b5-11e2-9a14-282adc24cdaa.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Grillo proposed Di Pietro as [[President of Italy|President of the Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beppegrillo.it/2012/11/antonio_di_piet_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; but ruled out any alliance between M5S and IdV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lastampa.it/2012/11/06/italia/politica/grillo-nessuna-alleanza-con-di-pietro-HGQOEdyVHPicpG4xhyrDEP/pagina.html&lt;/ref&gt; The interview caused unrest within party ranks&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/11/01/idv-donadi-intervista-e-necrologio-e-pardi-e-ora-di-cambiare-leader/400744/&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the exit of a "moderate" wing led by Massimo Donadi, who was replaced as floor leader in the Chamber by [[Antonio Borghesi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/novembre/09/Idv_altro_addio_Caccia_deputati_co_0_20121109_8b97bad4-2a35-11e2-8158-e1332556f42a.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Donadi, along with other three deputies ([[Nello Formisano]], [[Giovanni Paladini]] and [[Gaetano Porcino]]) and one senator ([[Stefano Pedica]]), launched [[Rights and Freedom]] (DL),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.agi.it/politica/notizie/201211221148-pol-rt10098-donadi_lancia_diritti_e_liberta_caro_tonino_senza_rancore |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305014303/http://www.agi.it/politica/notizie/201211221148-pol-rt10098-donadi_lancia_diritti_e_liberta_caro_tonino_senza_rancore |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ivg.it/2012/11/i-fuoriusciti-dellidv-fondano-diritti-e-liberta-marylin-fusco-la-politica-del-fare-iniziava-a-scricchiolare/&lt;/ref&gt; which later joined the [[Democratic Centre (Italy)|Democratic Centre]] (CD).

In October 2012 also de Magistris quit the party and formed the [[Orange Movement]] (MA), which was joined by many IdV left-wingers.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/dicembre/13/Arancioni_campo_Lotta_alla_mafia_co_0_20121213_523ccd34-44f1-11e2-a357-2faad4646d31.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; However, as soon as late December both IdV and MA were founding components of [[Civil Revolution]] (RC), a far-left coalition led by [[Antonio Ingroia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/dicembre/30/Ingroia_candida_attacca_Grasso_Scelto_co_0_20121230_78884a4e-5249-11e2-b6fa-b83cb0fbff5f.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and re-organisation (2013–present)===
In the [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 general election]] RC won a mere 2.2% of the vote and IdV was thus out of Parliament for the first time in almost ten years.

After RC's debacle, Di Pietro resigned from party president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unita.it/italia/speciale-elezioni-2013/di-pietro-si-dimette-da-capo-dell-idv-1.485515 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302020752/http://www.unita.it/italia/speciale-elezioni-2013/di-pietro-si-dimette-da-capo-dell-idv-1.485515 |archivedate=2 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 May Di Pietro, on behalf of the party's executive, announced that the experience of RC was over for IdV and that the party would elect a new leader during a congress to be held in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italiadeivalori.it/interna/20752-lidv-riparte-congresso-straordinario-a-giugno |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016050952/http://www.italiadeivalori.it/interna/20752-lidv-riparte-congresso-straordinario-a-giugno |archivedate=16 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, [[Leoluca Orlando]], [[Felice Belisario]], [[Carlo Costantini]] and other leading members of IdV left the party to launch the [[139 Movement]] (139 being the number of the articles of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/palermo/notizie/politica/2013/15-giugno-2013/orlando-sfida-aperta-pdora-c-movimento-139-2221665607709.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Italy)|2014 European election]], IdV received just 0.65% of the vote, losing the party's remaining representation in the European Parliament.

In the party congress, convened for 28–30 June, delegates chose the new leader, a secretary instead of a president, among five candidates: [[Antonio Borghesi]], [[Matteo Castellarin]], [[Ignazio Messina]], [[Niccolò Rinaldi]] and [[Nicola Scalera]]. In the last ballot Messina was elected with 69.1% of the vote over Rinaldi, who had received the endorsements of Borghesi, Castellarin and Scalera.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2013/06/30/news/idv_messina_il_nuovo_segretario-62126586/&lt;/ref&gt; In October Di Pietro left the party altogether.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antoniodipietro.it/2014/10/coraggio-e-tempo-di-ricominciare&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015 the party was joined by three senators ([[Alessandra Bencini]], [[Maurizio Romani]] and [[Francesco Molinari (politician)|Francesco Molinari]]) and saw the return of a deputy (Formisano). However, in 2017 Formisano left again in order to join the [[Article 1 – Democratic and Progressive Movement|Democratic and Progressive Movement]] (MDP), which was joined also by Di Pietro.

In December 2017 IdV was a founding member of the [[Popular Civic List]] (CP), a centrist electoral list within the centre-left coalition, along with [[Popular Alternative]] (AP), the [[Centrists for Europe]] (CpE), [[Solidary Democracy]] (DeS), the [[Union for Trentino]] (UpT), [[Italy is Popular]] (IP) and minor parties/groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/12/29/news/nasce_la_lista_centrista_alleata_col_pd_sara_guidata_da_lorenzin-185423728&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2017/12/29/centrosinistra-ce-anche-il-terzo-mini-alleato-del-pd-civica-popolare-guidata-dalla-lorenzin-simbolo-una-margherita/4065143/|title=Centrosinistra, c'è anche il terzo mini-alleato del Pd: Civica Popolare guidata dalla Lorenzin.

In the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]] CP obtained a mere 0.5% and no seats, thus IdV was again excluded from Parliament.

==Ideology and factions==
While the party had been generally aligned with the [[Centre-left in Italy|centre-left]], its members had been very diverse ideologically, ranging from the [[far-left politics|far left]] (i.e. [[Franca Rame]], a former member of ''[[Soccorso Rosso]]'', and [[Pancho Pardi]], a former activist of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'') to the [[right-wing politics|right]], thanks to the populist message of the party. The party includes former [[Italian Communist Party|Communists]] and former ''[[Lega Nord|Leghisti]]'', as well as former ''[[Italian Social Movement|Missini]]'' and several former [[Christian Democracy (Italy, 1997)|Christian Democrats]]. According to 2009 a study by [[Pino Pisicchio]], a political scientist who was then deputy of IdV, 57.1% of the party's MPs were former Christian Democrats or members of post-Christian Democratic parties (including 11.9% from the [[Union of Democrats for Europe|UDEUR Populars]]), 9.5% were former Communists, 4.8% came from far-left parties and movements, 2.4% were former ''Missini'' and 2.4% former ''Leghisti''.&lt;ref&gt;Pino Pisicchio, ''Italia dei Valori. Il post partito'', Rubbettino, [[Soveria Mannelli]] ([[Province of Catanzaro|CZ]]) 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party is a supporter of [[legality]], [[law and order (politics)|law and order]], the [[police]] forces, [[first-past-the-post voting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noisefromamerika.org/index.php/articoli/Dove_sta_andando_la_riforma_elettorale%3F|title=Dove sta andando la riforma elettorale?|date=2006-12-21|publisher=noiseFromAmeriKa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[federalism]], corporate reform, lowering the costs of politics, improving the efficiency of [[public service]]s, fighting corruption, simplifying trials bureaucracy to achieve faster verdicts and regulating [[conflict of interest]].

During the [[Prodi II Cabinet]] IdV was one of the most [[centrism|centrist]] voices in the centre-left coalition and sometimes, despite its harsh criticism of Berlusconi, it switched sides in Parliament on some key issues. At some point, Di Pietro even proposed an electoral alliance between its party, the UDEUR Populars and the [[Union of the Centre (2002)|Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (UDC), while ruling out any future alliance with the far left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2007/agosto/01/Mai_piu_alleati_della_sinistra_co_9_070801020.shtml|title=Mai più alleati della sinistra massimalista|date=2007-08-01|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2007/agosto/10/Aggregare_moderati_Divide_appello_Casini_co_9_070810021.shtml|title="Aggregare i moderati" Divide l' appello di Casini|date=2007-08-10|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2007/ottobre/27/Pietro_meglio_Tabacci_degli_sfasciavetrine_co_9_071027019.shtml|title=Di Pietro: meglio Tabacci degli "sfasciavetrine". E lui: con Tonino? Si può fare|date=2007-10-27|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the [[Berlusconi IV Cabinet]], IdV supported some plans of the government, notably the introduction of [[fiscal federalism]]. However, due to its uncompromising ''anti-berlusconismo'', IdV has been at times very popular among left-wing voters, a fact that was highlighted also by the increasing number of communists in party ranks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/febbraio/06/Capo_delfino_platea_divisa_Luca_co_8_100206016.shtml |title=Capo e "delfino", platea divisa Su De Luca il nuovo duello |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often forms stable alliances with the parties of the far left at the local level, such as in the case of [[Luigi de Magistris (mayor)|Luigi de Magistris]]' election as mayor of Naples or in the [[Sicilian regional election, 2012|2012 regional election in Sicily]]. The shift to the left embodied by the emergence of figures like de Magistris and [[Franco Grillini]] (honorary president of [[Arcigay]], who joined in November 2009).&lt;ref name="Corriere 7-11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/novembre/07/Idv_lacerata_liti_addii_ritorni_co_8_091107036.shtml |title=Idv lacerata da liti, addii e ritorni E De Magistris lavora alla fronda |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was criticised by Pisicchio because, in his view, it was endangering the centrist nature of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/aprile/19/Pisicchio_ideologo_Pietro_nostra_base_co_9_090419026.shtml|title=Pisicchio, l' ideologo di Di Pietro: la nostra base è ex dc|date=2009-04-19|publisher=[[Corriere della Sera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the party has continued to recruit people also on the right, such as [[Alessandro Cè]], a [[social conservatism|social-conservative]] former member of [[Lega Nord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/novembre/16/Pietro_sfida_suoi_delusi_co_8_091116016.shtml |title=E Di Pietro sfida i "suoi" delusi |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that IdV was a member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]], formerly known as European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), does not mean that it is a [[liberalism|liberal]] party.&lt;ref name="BardiKatzMair_136"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Luciano Bardi |author2=Richard S. Katz |author3=Peter Mair |title=Towards a European Politics |work=Parties and Party Systems: Structure and Context |publisher=UBC Press |year=2015 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding its former European affiliation, the party has rarely been regarded as liberal in Italy, due to its "justicialist" and "populist" tendencies. In fact the party's character is that of a "protest party" and it opposes many policies generally supported by liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agoravox.it/Di-Pietro-e-l-Idv-liberali-solo-a.html |title=Di Pietro e l'Idv: liberali solo a parole – AgoraVox Italia |publisher=Agoravox.it |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the left Di Pietro is described as a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] by [[Fausto Bertinotti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFFBpOClLO4|title=Bertinotti: "Di Pietro non fa opposizione, è un populista di destra"|date=2007-08-10|publisher=[[SKY TG24]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by some political commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clandestinoweb.com/le-opinioni-di-luigi-crespi/voto-08-veltroni-dipietro-lapparentamento-della-vergogna.-di-l.c.html|title=VOTO' 08: VELTRONI/DIPIETRO L'APPARENTAMENTO DELLA VERGOGNA. di L.Crespi |date=2008-02-13|publisher=[[Clandestinoweb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.sardegna.it/documenti/1_60_20081020103028.pdf|title="Moriremo dipietristi?"

Di Pietro added that "ELDR as the common house of European Liberals is the political home for us in terms of common convictions and a strong support for the cause of political freedoms in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eldr.eu/en/news/2010/03/european-and-italian-liberals-close-ranks-ahead-of-regional-elections |title=European and Italian Liberals close ranks ahead of regional elections |publisher=Eldr.eu |date=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2010-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720161221/http://www.eldr.eu/en/news/2010/03/european-and-italian-liberals-close-ranks-ahead-of-regional-elections |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2010 party congress, Di Pietro remarked IdV's liberal identity and denounced what he called "Berlusconi's false liberalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/296772 |title=L'alternativa per una nuova Italia – Congresso Nazionale de L'Italia dei Valori – seconda giornata |language=it |publisher=RadioRadicale.it |date=2010-02-06 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012 IdV became the first Italian political party to announce publicly that it would push for [[Same-sex marriage|marriage equality]]. Di Pietro said: "Our party has been the first in Italy to follow U.S. president [[Barack Obama]]. We invite other Italian parties to support gay marriage. You don't have to be shy, you have to say yes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.care2.com/causes/italian-political-party-say-yes-to-gay-marriage.html#13432076411271&amp;action=collapse_widget&amp;id=124804&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular support==
The 2001–2010 electoral results in the 10 most populated [[regions of Italy]] plus [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]] (the party's main strongholds) are shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elezionistorico.interno.it/ |title=::: Ministero dell'Interno ::: Archivio Storico delle Elezioni |language=it |publisher=Elezionistorico.interno.it |date= |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, the party is stronger in the [[Southern Italy|South]] than in the [[Northern Italy|North]], where the protest vote is absorbed primarily by [[Lega Nord]].

'''James Haughton Jr.''' (1929-2016) was a prominent American [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] activist, labor leader, [[Community organizing|community organizer]], and social worker. Haughton is most widely known for advocating for racial equality within the construction industry.

== Personal Life ==
James Haughton was born on October 1929 in Brooklyn, New York to James Haughton Sr. and Mary Miller, both immigrants from the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/nyregion/james-haughton-who-fought-racial-barriers-in-building-trades-dies-at-86.html|title=James Haughton, Who Fought Racial Barriers in Building Trades, Dies at 86|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haughton received a BSS from the [[City College of New York]] in 1951 and an [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] from [[New York University]] in 1960. From 1951 to 1953 Haughton fought in the [[Korean War]] as a US Army lieutenant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/scm/20945|title=archives.nypl.org -- James Haughton Papers|website=archives.nypl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 to 1960, Haughton worked with gangs in Los Angeles and New York City as a youth counselor and social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/nyregion/james-haughton-who-fought-racial-barriers-in-building-trades-dies-at-86.html|title=James Haughton, Who Fought Racial Barriers in Building Trades, Dies at 86|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Haughton married prominent anthropologist, social theorist, and feminist [[Eleanor Leacock|Elanor Leacock]] and remained with her until her death in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56014756|title=Notable American women : a biographical dictionary completing the twentieth century|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Belknap Press|others=Ware, Susan, 1950-, Braukman, Stacy Lorraine., Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.|year=|isbn=067401488X|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=374|oclc=56014756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
In 1960, Haughton joined the newly formed Negro American Labor Council (NALC), remaining involved with the organization until his 1962 departure. Following his involvement with NALC, Haughton served as chairman of the Labor and Industry Committee of the New York Branch of the [[NAACP]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Frustrated with a perceived passivity within established civil rights organizations, Haughton, in 1964, established the Harlem Unemployment Center. The organization, renamed Fight Back in 1969, employed more aggressive tactics in advocating for minority hiring in the construction industry, equal employment opportunities, and minority—particularly Black and Puerto Rican— inclusion in unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/7038/|title=James Haughton on Racism in the House of Labor|last=Jackson|first=Janine|date=1999|website=George Mason University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2016/may/12/james-haughton-crusader-against-construction-indus/|title=James Haughton, crusader against the construction industry|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haughton was involved in a number of other causes including the [[anti-war movement]], [[anti-nuclear movement]], [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-Apartheid movement]], and Puerto Rico solidarity movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/436872248|title=James Haughton papers, 1924-1984 (bulk 1959-1982)|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Afghan provincial governors front row.jpg|thumb|250px|A regional ''jirga'' in [[Jalalabad]], [[Afghanistan]].]]

A '''jirga''' (occasionally '''jarga''' or '''jargah'''; [[Pashto language|Pashto]]: {{big|جرګه}}) is a traditional assembly of leaders that make decisions by consensus and according to the teachings of [[Pashtunwali]]. It predates modern-day written or fixed-laws and is conducted to settle disputes among the [[Pashtun people]] but to a lesser extent among other nearby groups that have been influenced by Pashtuns (historically known as ''[[Afghans]]''). Its primary purpose has been to prevent tribal war. Most jirgas are conducted in [[Afghanistan]] but also among the Pashtun tribes in neighboring [[Pakistan]], especially in [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA) and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (KPK). In 2017, the Pakistani government was aiming to integrate jirgas into the formal justice system.&lt;Ref name=“veconomist” /&gt;  

According to &lt;i&gt;[[The Economist]]&lt;/i&gt;, “barbarism has become synonymous with jirgas” due to their use of punishments such as gang-rape, although, others view such punishments as rare and originating from illiterate backwaters.&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Pakistan is “mainstreaming” misogynist tribal justice|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21730202-it-fast-and-cheap-if-not-always-edifying-pakistan-mainstreaming-misogynist-tribal-justice|work=[[The Economist]]|date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology and its Function ==

'Jirga' itself is a well-known term of Mongolian origin. It referred historically to a large assembly of men forming a very broad circle, initially intended for laying siege around games or animals to be hunted for sport or for food. Probably, the Pashtun elders were also sitting initially in a circular formation when debating and hearing a given dispute.

The community council meaning is often found in circumstances involving a dispute between two individuals; a jirga may be part of the [[dispute resolution]] mechanism in such cases. The disputants would usually begin by finding a [[Mediation|mediator]], choosing someone such as a senior religious leader, a local notable, or a mediation specialist (a ''[[Khan (title)|khan]]'' or ''Malik''). In tribal Pashtun society the Maliks serve as ''[[de facto]]'' arbiters in local conflicts, interlocutors in state policy-making, tax-collectors, heads of village and town councils and delegates to provincial and national jirgas as well as to Parliament. The mediator hears from the two sides and then forms a jirga of community elders, taking care to include supporters of both sides. The jirga then considers the case and, after discussing the matter, comes to a decision about how to handle it, which the mediator then announces. The jirga's conclusion is binding.

The jirga was also used as a [[court]] in cases of criminal conduct, but this usage is being replaced by formal courts in some settled areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, elsewhere it is still used as courts in tribal regions.

The jirga holds the prestige of a court in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Although a political agent appointed by the national government maintains law and order through the [[Frontier Crimes Regulation]] (FCR), the actual power lies in the jirga. The political agent maintains law and order in his tribal region with the help of jirgas. The jirga can award [[capital punishment]], such as [[stoning]] to death in case of adultery, or expulsion from the community.

The Sindh High Court imposed a ban on the holding of jirgas in April 2004&lt;ref&gt;SBLR 2004 Sindh 918; [http://www.dawn.com/news/1072875/a-first-step excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt; because of the sometimes inhumane sentences awarded to people, especially women and men who marry of their own free will. The ban, however, has been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/476785/tribal-courts-shc-seeks-official-version-against-jirgas/ SHC seeks official version against jirgas] (2012-12-08)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent military operations against [[al Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]] in Pakistan's restive southern tribal agencies bordering Afghanistan, jirgas played a key role of moderator between the government and the militants. The tradition of jirga has also been adopted by Muslims in the [[Kashmir valley]] of [[Indian-administered Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="telegraphindia1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061030/asp/nation/story_6934322.asp |title=Justice rolls in Kashmir, Afghan-style - Jilted, sheep stolen' Some people in the Valley never go to police but pin faith on a time-tested tribal system to settle disputes and redress grievances |work =[[The Telegraph (Calcutta) |The Telegraph]] - Calcutta, India |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2013-11-26 |author=Muzaffar Raina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An all-female jirga Khwaindo jirga ("sister's council") was held in Pakistan, and had 25 members.&lt;ref name="foxnews1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/11/women-challenge-men-in-pakistan-first-female-jirga/#ixzz2Z2Iis4tr |title=Women challenge men in Pakistan's first female jirga |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-11-26 |author=Khurram Shahzad |agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was headed by [[Tabassum Adnan]] which helped 11 women get justice as of 2013.&lt;ref name="foxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afpak.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/11/president_asif_ali_zardaris_security_chief_killed_in_bazaar_attack |title=President Asif Ali Zardari's security chief killed in bazaar attack |author=Jennifer Rowland |author2=Bailey Cahall |section= |work =[[Foreign Policy]]: The AfPak Channel |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56125">'''John D. Hamaker''' (1914–1994), was an [[United States|American]] [[mechanical engineer]], [[ecologist]], [[agronomist]] and science writer in the fields of [[soil regeneration]], [[rock dust]]ing, [[mineral cycles]], [[climate cycles]] and [[glaciology]].

==Biography==

===Background===

John Hamaker was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], [[United States]] and graduated from [[Purdue University]] in [[Mechanical Engineering]]. Concerned for the [[Natural environment|environment]], he became a student of [[ecology]] and [[agriculture]] and was influenced by books such as ''Bread From Stones'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Bread From Stones: A New and Rational System of Land Fertilization and Physical Regeneration'', republished by Acres USA, Austin, Texas&amp;nbsp;– Julius Hensel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbon-negative.us/soil/bread.htm Julius Hensel by John Mann]&lt;/ref&gt; which showed [[plants]] grow better in [[soils]] generated by mimicking natural soil-forming processes that take [[millennia]], such as the advance and retreat of [[glaciers]] scouring over the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], or rock [[weathering]] of [[volcanic]] [[lava]]. In the 1960s, Hamaker cultivated a strong interest in soil and climate issues, and began publishing articles about how the health of an individual, society and [[planet]]ary ecology only thrive as an integrated interdependent whole. For 30 years, he wrote and campaigned for [[organic agriculture]] based on [[soil remineralization]], and was the first to call for the remineralization of the [[Earth]] to forestall the next [[glacial period]] within the current [[ice age]] cycle. Hamaker produced a notable book ''The Survival Of Civilization'' in 1982, republished in 2002&lt;ref&gt;"Hamaker's book, The Survival of Civilization, published in 1982, declares that only a worldwide remineralization of the soil can stop a plunge into the worst catastrophe of recorded history. He wrote that we must stop fossil fuel use on a crash basis, grind rocks to put the minerals back into the soil to save our forests and crops, and manage the greatest social transition ever attempted. Otherwise we die.", ''The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited'', Acres, U.S.A., Volume 16, page 28, published by Acres U.S.A., Kansas City, Missouri, 1989, digitized by Cornell University, Dec 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; by Remineralize The Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remineralize.org/don/synopsis01.html The Survival Of Civilization by John D Hamaker, Remineralize The Earth, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.remineralize.org]

===Early developments===

In the 1970s, a series of scientific conferences concluded that the world's climate is [[Global cooling|cooling]].&lt;ref&gt;Implications of the Climatic Controversy for Global Society, Irving Kaplan, November 1980, "In 1972, a sizable group of climatologists meeting at Brown University issued letters to the governments of the world in which they warned of a global climatic disaster. Again in 1974, the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study issued a similarly grave message to the community of governments from a meeting in Bonn. In 1976, a meeting of 85 climatologists chaired by the late Nobel Laureate Willard Libby and pioneer climatologist Cesare Emiliani put forth another warning which it had written in 1974 and which provided the same message in greater detail. The consensus of the 1979 World Climate Conference was reported by Nature as stating that the world had entered a 10,000 year cooling, that the warming theory was complex and questionable and that the loss of life and economic substance to the climate would increase."&lt;/ref&gt; Books such as ''The Cooling'',&lt;ref&gt;The Cooling, Lowe Ponte, 1976, "The cooling has already killed thousands of people in poor nations. If it continues and no strong measures are taken to deal with it, the cooling will cause world famine, world chaos, and probably world war, and this could all come about by the year 2000."&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Weather Conspiracy'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Weather Conspiracy'', Peter Kilroy, Alastair Clark and The Climate Impact Team, Heron Publishing/Ballantine Books (1977). {{ISBN|0-345-27209-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Weather Machine &amp; The Threat Of Ice'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Weather Machine &amp; The Threat Of Ice'', Nigel Calder, BBC Publications, 1974, "Going by past form, the warm periods between ice ages last about 10,000 years and ours has lasted 10,000 years. One might therefore argue that there is a virtual certainty of the next ice age starting some time in the next two thousand years. Then the odds are only about 20 to 1 against it beginning in the next 100 years."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Climates Of Hunger'',&lt;ref&gt;Climates Of Hunger, Reid Bryson &amp; Thomas Murray, University of Wisconsin Press, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ice Ages''&lt;ref&gt;''Ice Ages'', Imbrie and Imbrie, 1979, Enslow Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Climate: Present, Past &amp; Future'',&lt;ref&gt;''Climate: Present, Past &amp; Future'', H. H. Lamb, Routledge 1977&lt;/ref&gt; warned of a coming ice age within decades. In 1975, Newsweek ran an article entitled "The Cooling World" that foretold the [[wikt:decimation|decimation]] of agricultural productivity based on a dramatic decrease in the Earth's [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/newsweek-coolingworld.pdf Newsweek, The Cooling World, 28 April 1975]&lt;/ref&gt; and the New York Times published the article "Scientists ask why world is changing; Major cooling may be ahead".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/ny-times-1975-05-21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, books such as ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'', [[Edward Goldsmith]], Penguin Books, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Limits To Growth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Limits To Growth'', Donella Meadows, Club Of Rome, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Population Bomb]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The Population Bomb, Paul Ehrlich, Ballantine Books, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; warned of multiple [[social]], [[economic]], [[ecological]] and [[population]] [[crises]]. At the same time, Hamaker continued to generate articles and bulletins&lt;ref&gt;''Factors That May Be Bringing On The Next Ice Age and How We Can Stop It'', John Hamaker, Hamaker Weaver Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solar Age Or Ice Age? Bulletin, John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; as well as campaign, on what was by now his main pre-occupation, the remineralization of the world's [[soils]].

According to his writings, in 1976, Hamaker spread rock dust on part of his {{convert|10|acre|m2}} in [[Michigan]]. The following year, his [[Maize|corn]] produced 65 [[bushels]] per [[acre]], compared to [[Crop yield|yield]]s of under 25 from other local [[farms]], and also tested higher in many [[minerals]]. He calculated that remineralizing the soil with [[river]], [[Shore|seashore]], [[mountain]] and [[glacial]] rock dust, would enable [[United States|American]] agriculture to produce four times as much [[food]] or the same amount with a 25% reduction in cost, without the need for [[pesticides]] or [[chemical fertilizers]].

===''The Survival Of Civilization''===

In 1982, he produced with [[California]]n [[ecologist]] Donald A. Weaver ''The Survival Of Civilization: Carbon Dioxide, Investment Money, Population&amp;nbsp;– Three Problems Threatening Our Existence'', which was re-published by Remineralize The Earth in 2002&lt;ref&gt;http://www.remineralize.org/don/synopsis01.html The Survival Of Civilization: Carbon Dioxide, Investment Money, Population&amp;nbsp;– Three Problems Threatening Our Existence; Soil, Tectonics, Climate &amp; Economic Systems Explained-Problems and Solutions'', John Hamaker &amp; Donald Weaver, Hamaker Weaver Publishers, 1982 / Remineralize The Earth, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 by SoilandHealth.org. Annotations and supporting evidence were provided by Weaver. The book which initially sold 14,000 copies, concerned the threat of an imminent ice age, remineralizing the world's soils on a local and global scale and [[reforesting]] the [[planet]] to return [[atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] to a normal [[interglacial]] level near 280 ppm, to help slow the glacial advance.&lt;ref&gt;"worldwide destruction of forests at 30 hectares per minute, plus acid rain and pollution, depleted minerals in soils&amp;nbsp;– also causing trees and forests to die and burn, causing the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere normally balanced by forests, causing extremes in climate, cold, heat, drought, floods, storms, wind and an imminent new ice age, causing crop failure, food shortages, global famine and starvation, - is the end of civilization." ''The Survival Of Civilization'', John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[treatise]] was a synthesis of Hamaker's thinking that emerged from his studies and research in several disciplines including [[soil science]] and [[paleoclimatology]]. His message, dubbed the ''Hamaker Thesis'', was that due to [[intensive farming|modern]] agricultural and agro-forestry practices, the soils were running out of minerals, causing the dying and burning of [[forests]] worldwide and [[nutrient]] deficiencies in food. He offered soil remineralization as a solution, advocating regeneration of soil and forests with rock dusts as an economic and ecologically [[sustainable]] alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Hamaker regarded this as one of the most powerful ideas in [[human history]]. The book and its message was well received by soil and [[nutritional]] [[scientists]] and regarded as a [[blueprint]] for restoring the planet's ecological integrity by the worldwide remineralization movement.&lt;ref&gt;"The book contained a carbon dioxide curve based on the Mauna Loa recorded concentration of carbon dioxide between 1957 and 1976, plus an anticipated extension of the curve based on soil demineralization and anticipated forest decline and burning. This curve demonstrates that more than 345 part per million of {{CO2}} will produce a glacial period if nothing is done to reduce the carbon dioxide. The destruction of our forests must be offset and a sufficient soil forest-energy program must be carried out to stop and reverse the {{CO2}} increase." ''The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited'', Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, eco-agriculture newspaper, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testimonials===

Endorsing the book, [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[inventor]] of the [[geodesic dome]], author of the book ''Critical Path'' and Professor Emeritus at the University of [[Pennsylvania]], wrote in a publicized letter to Donald Weaver in 1983: "I have received and read John Hamaker’s ''The Survival of Civilization''. Well done. Completely convincing.... I will tell all those inquiring of me about matters relevant to our survival that they had best read Hamaker's book." &lt;ref&gt;''To Love &amp; Regenerate The Earth'' (book), Don Weaver, 2002, remineralize.org&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book, writer Bertram Cohen expressed concern that a [[Earth|global]] [[climate]] [[Abrupt climate change|shift]] would make the [[temperate zone]] part of the sub-[[arctic]] zone and deprive [[World population|humanity]] of its [[food supply]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Bertram Cohen, ''Health Science Journal'', American Natural Hygiene Society, Tampa, Florida, July 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen also pointed out that "Dr [[Herbert Shelton]], both in his books and in Hygienic Review, emphasised the importance of soil remineralization in creating a Hygienic Agriculture." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In support of the book, The Earth Renewal Society presented a statement to a [[Congressional hearing]] in [[Chicago]] in March 1984.&lt;ref&gt;(Palynologist) Geneviève Woillard has shown that the transition period to an Ice Age occurs in a 75 to 150 period with an intense 20 year changeover period at the end. John Hamaker states that we are 10 years into this changeover period. His criteria are the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: the annual rate of increase doubled from 1975 to 1985 and will double again from 1985 to 1995. Other criteria: the increase of volcanic activity and of [[earthquakes]], the shortening of the growing seasons, the increase of [[soil erosion]] - doubling in the United States from 1975 to 1981 - the increased flooding in spring, the increase of drought in the tropical areas and the drought in the temperate zones in summer, the increasing severity of winters, the increase of snow and ice masses in the polar regions, the advances of glaciers in localized areas such as [[China]] and the increase of forest fires." The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, Acres USA, 1990s, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries and inventions==

===Rock medicine===

Hamaker believed remineralizing the world's soil with rock dust, a [[quarrying]] [[by-product]], could revitalise barren soil and reverse climate change. Rock dust nourished soil [[micro-organisms]] whose [[protoplasm]] is the basis of all living things. When mixed with [[compost]], the dust created rich, deep soils which could produce high growth [[vegetation]] free from [[pest (organism)|pest]]s and [[predator]]s, at an accelerated rate. The idea was later confirmed by agricultural scientists such as Arden Andersen, who showed how high [[sugar]] and [[mineral]] levels in soil gave [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to soil [[bacteria]], stopping [[insect]] and [[fungal]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;''Anatomy Of Life and Energy in Agriculture'', Arden Andersen, Paperback. {{ISBN|0-911311-19-X}}. Publisher: Acres USA.&lt;/ref&gt; For Hamaker and Andersen, minerals were the primal food for micro-organisms which provided [[life]] and [[health]] for the soil.

===Rock grinders===

Hamaker invented an [[autogenous grinding mill|autogenous]] rock [[Mill (grinding)|grinder]], designed to grind rock upon rock with minimal wear of [[metal]] parts, and a macro version, both for creating rock dust. The full design for the rock grinder was described in ''The Survival Of Civilization'' and Donald Weaver's ''To Love And Regenerate The Earth''. On 19 October 1984, [[China]]'s Research Institute of Forests accepted a copy of Hamaker's rock grinder [[patent]] papers, since at the time, China was taking the lead in [[reforestation]] programs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific basis==

===Climate cycles===

The Earth's soil is demineralized during every [[interglacial period]], the short 10,000-year [[warm period]] between every 90,000-year glacial period which is within the current Ice Age or [[Quaternary Period]] encompassing the [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]], or current [[interglacial]]. This causes a decline in the world's forests and other vegetation which are [[carbon dioxide sinks]], and so more carbon dioxide is released into the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stone Age Science: Rejuvenating The Earth With Rock Dust'', Dylan Keating, Permaculture, Spring 2007, "As we reach the end of the interglacial period, the minerals have mainly left the soil.... as these minerals leave the soil, plant life decreases and carbon is released. The increased carbon acts as a signal to the planet that minerals are needed. The Earth then goes through a glacial period to replace those nutrients."&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere rose throughout the 20th century and continue to do so. Excessive [[heat]] from the [[sun]] is trapped by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other [[greenhouse gases]], affecting global climate. Hamaker explained the 100,000-year cycle of major ice ages by postulating that the [[greenhouse effect]] takes place mainly in the [[tropics]], which receives the most sun, instead of in [[polar region]]s.

===Polar expansion===

When temperature differences between the [[poles]] and the tropics increase, a cycle of heavy [[wind]], [[hurricanes]], [[storms]] and [[tornadoes]] occurs.&lt;ref&gt;''The Next Ice Age'', Larry Ephron, in The Futurist; September 01, 1989, "The hot tropical air rises faster, and cold polar air rushes in to replace it. The result is higher winds, including more and bigger hurricanes and tornadoes. These greenhouse winds often carry much moisture with them, evaporated from the overheated tropical oceans. Carried in clouds to the higher latitudes, this moisture falls as increasing rain during the spring and fall and as increasing snow during the winter. Thus, winters get longer and colder, and there are more devastating floods in the spring."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Next Ice Age Is on Its Way, Philip V. Brennan, Newsmax.com, Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2005 "The {{CO2}} becomes moisture and falls as rain in the summer, autumn and spring, and snow in winter."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How Global Warming May Cause The Next Ice Age, Thom Hartmann, adapted from chapter in The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight, Three Rivers Press&lt;/ref&gt; More [[evaporated]] [[moisture]] is carried to higher [[latitudes]] where it is deposited in [[ice]] and [[snow]], the eventual result being [[glaciation]] and another ice age.&lt;ref&gt;"the global climate system seems to be more stable when the Earth has a huge volume of water locked in ice sheets in polar regions than under the present condition with ice sheets existing only on Antarctica and Greenland. It is therefore possible that the present global warming may act as the trigger of the next glaciation. If the interglacial is indeed a brief unstable period for Earth, then we should be very careful not to risk triggering the shift to the next glacial period through anthropogenic activities.", Isamu Kayane in Interactions between the Biospheric Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle and Land Use/Cover Change, Global Change Newsletter, 25: 8-9, March 1996, quoted in Global Warming Triggers New Ice Age, Living Nutrition, Volume 4, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Record snow in the [[Northern hemisphere]] and the shortening of the [[growing season]] is a prevailing pattern. As glaciers [[Glacial motion|advance]] and recede during each ice age, they grind down rocks in their path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturallifemagazine.com/9712/organics.htm Remineralization by Jeff Johnston, Natural Life Magazine, 1997 "These glaciers ground rock into powders as fine as flour and distributed them over wide areas."]&lt;/ref&gt; The mineral-rich dust is distributed over the Earth's surface, by powerful wind and [[water]] [[systems]], remineralizing soils and enlivening plant life.

===Shorter growing season===

Hamaker believed that within as little as a [[decade]], the growing season would decrease leading to mass [[starvation]] in [[Wealth|rich]] and [[Poverty|poor]] [[nations]] alike. He therefore proposed the remineralization of the world's soils and reforesting the land, to propagate carbon sinks, thereby absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and so contributing to general climatic stability. By assuming the task of remineralizing the Earth's soils, just like glaciers do during an ice age, remineralization would create fertile soils&amp;nbsp;– the basis for the re-creation of stable [[ecosystems]].

===Glacial threat===

Hamaker believed in a distinct and imminent threat of a new glacial period, following a long series of glaciations in the [[geological]] and glacial-interglacial cycle [[timeframe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Climatic Cycles (Hamaker)'', Australia: Nexus Magazine, 1990s, vol. 1, no. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Climate: The Key to Understanding Business Cycles'', Raymond H. Wheeler, Tide Press (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that remineralizing the world's soils and reforesting the land could generate a climax geosystem (as opposed to a pioneer one), through mass reforestation. This would solve the [[climate crisis]] as well as the [[food crisis]], by assisting the planet's ability to geophysiologically self-regulate, and potentially, postpone the next glaciation indefinitely.

===Volcanic El Ninos===

Hamaker also believed that increased [[tectonic]] activity occurring with snow and ice buildup, could heat up tropical [[oceans]] through [[sea floor]] [[volcanism]], and in addition to the intensified greenhouse effect, be a prime cause of the [[El Nino]] phenomenon.

==Corroborated findings==

In 1983, [[Nicholas Shackleton]] and other [[UK]] scientists published an article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' which stated that the last glacial period began when the {{CO2}} in the atmosphere reached about 290ppm, and that the world was already ahead of that figure at a critical 343-345 ppm. Hamaker explained the significance of Shackleton's findings in Acres USA:[http://www.acresusa.com] "{{CO2}} has its primary importance as the initiator of glaciation. Once an extensive ice field is established, its cooling effect maintains the temperature differential which keeps glaciation going. Variations in the amount of {{CO2}} simply cause variations in the world albedo, but they do not stop or start glaciation. The world is committed to glaciation when the ice fields alone reflect enough sunlight to ensure cooling." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On 3 June 1984, Hamaker appeared on [[Ted Turner]]'s [[Atlanta]] [[Superstation]] declaring that increased high-latitude [[albedo]] is what initiates glacial advances/retreats. He was citing [[George Simpson (meteorologist)|Sir George Simpson]]'s 1938 analysis on ice ages&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Sir George, Ice Ages, Nature 141: 591, 1938, reprinted in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution 1938, 289-302.&lt;/ref&gt; and later commentary by [[Richard Somerville]] and Lorraine Remer of the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in their article in the Journal of Geophysical Research: "It's that cloud that you have to worry about because it's reflecting 80% of the sun's energy back into space and it's never becoming effective in warming the Earth. So we're getting cooling as the result of the carbon dioxide buildup." &lt;ref&gt;''The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited'', by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA (newspaper), 1990s&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, [[Scientific American]] summarized: "They (Somerville &amp; Remer) suggest the global warming might be lessened by concurrent changes in the properties of clouds... Denser clouds will reflect a larger proportion of incoming solar radiation; the reduction in the energy reaching the surface will counteract the greenhouse effect." &lt;ref&gt;Scientific American article quoted in ''The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited'', by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1984, Robert Beckman produced ''The Downwave'' citing the studies of Dr. [[Raymond Wheeler]] and its climate-societal implications.&lt;ref&gt;The Downwave, Robert Beckman, 1984, "Dr Raymond Wheeler of the University of Kansas invested 20 years and a staff of over 200 to compile detailed charts covering 3,000 years of world weather, correlated with the exact dates of significant events in recorded history. According to Wheeler, the world should now be preparing for long shortages in water supplies and for shorter, not longer, growing seasons. Colder weather and longer droughts will bring a scarcity of food for the prosperous nations, famine and staration for the less economically stable."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, climatologist [[George Kukla]], expressed support for the belief in an imminent ice-age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/an_unrepentant_prognosticator.php An Unrepentant Prognosticator, Climatologist George Kukla still believes an ice age is likely, Mari  Krueger,  Gelf Magazine, April 24, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
John D. Hamaker's work inspired a growing [[Social movement|movement]] of [[people]] to become involved in remineralization, including [[permaculture|permaculturists]], organic [[farmers]], [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] farmers, [[gardeners]], [[vegetarians]], [[environmentalists]], scientists, [[climatologists]], [[journalists]], [[Religious denomination|religious groups]], [[political groups]], [[community organizations]] and ordinary [[citizens]].

===''Remineralize The Earth''===

In the 1980s, Hamaker became a [[catalyst]] for the formation of Remineralize The Earth (RTE), set up by Joanna Campe, its President and Executive Director who produced the Soil Remineralization Newsletter in the 1980s and Remineralize the Earth magazine in the 1990s, before the [[non-profit]] organization's [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] in 1994.

RTE began promoting the regeneration of soils and forests worldwide with finely ground rock dust as a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. As well as [[recycling]] and returning [[organic matter]] to the soil, the organization asserted that returning all of the mineral nutrients which create fertile soils and healthy crops and forests, was equally important. For RTE, remineralization was essential to restoring [[ecological balance]] and stabilizing the climate.

In 1994, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]], National Stone Association and National Aggregates Association co-sponsored a [[symposium]]  "Soil Remineralization and Sustainable Agriculture" at USDA headquarters in [[Washington DC]].

In 1995, Campe coordinated a two-year research project with the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] into remineralization.

In Campe's letter to [[Newsweek]] Magazine in October 2006, she warned that [[global warming]] could trigger an ice age &lt;ref&gt;“we are still concerned that global warming could trigger an ice age. Remineralize the Earth advocates the remineralization of soils worldwide with finely ground rock dust as an alternative to chemical fertlilizers and pesticides and as a way to sequester carbon and stabilize the climate, whether it is ultimately warming or cooling.” [[Newsweek]], October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and that soil remineralization and reforestation were the solutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Global warming is now accelerating so quickly and so alarmingly, that if the Arctic were to totally melt, it would possibly take us out of the glacial to interglacial cycle altogether. Otherwise, warming leading to cooling is still a possibility. Remineralization of soils is not only key to stabilizing the climate, but in this era of great concern about peak oil, could create an [[post-scarcity economy|economics of abundance]] rather than scarcity (fertilizing soils with petrochemicals). Millions of tons of mineral fines are stored as a by-product of the aggregate industry and could be the basis for a new sustainable agriculture and forestry." [[Newsweek]], October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, major [[magazines]] expressed concern of a coming ice age including The [[Atlantic Monthly]],&lt;ref&gt;The Great Climate Flip-Flop, William Calvin, Atlantic Monthly, January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Sea Study Warns Mini Ice Age May Be Coming Soon'', James Owen, National Geographic News, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Discover Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;Discover, "Global Warming Surprise: A New Ice Age", "Oceanographers have discovered a huge river of freshwater in the Atlantic formed by melting polar ice. They warn it could soon bury the Gulf Stream, plunging North America and Europe into frigid winters."&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Spectator]]&lt;ref&gt;Preparing For The Big Chill, Andrew Kenny, The Spectator, 22 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BBC Focus]] Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Focus Magazine, Snowball Earth edition&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institutes]] in [[Northern Europe]] and the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] shared the concern.

Campe was invited by the [[U.S. State Department]] to speak at the [[Washington International Renewable Energy Conference]] 2008.

In 2009, the Global Coral Reef Alliance invited RTE to produce a chapter for the DVD ROM book ''The Green Disk: New Technologies for A New World'', being distributed to all [[U.N.]] delegates at the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Copenhagen]] during December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''The Potential of Remineralization with Rock Mineral Fines to Transform Agriculture, Forestry, Sustainable Biofuels Production, Sequester Carbon and Stabilize the Climate'', Joanna Campe, Dan Kittredge and Lee Klinger, appearing in ''The Green Disk: New Technologies for a New World'' (Gibby Media Group Inc, 2009), "Soil Remineralization (SR) creates fertile soils by returning the minerals to the soil much the same way the Earth does: by weathering of minerals from rocks.", "SR is an essential tool for sustainable development, economic empowerment, and social justice by creating a local nutrient dense food supply for all,  improved health and generating livelihoods within local communities and  it can play a critical role in overcoming  hunger and poverty, ecological restoration, carbon sequestration and climate stabilization." https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AWwNnu6EDTeLZGM2OTJmOWdfMTgwa3c0OTgzZmc&amp;hl=en&amp;invite=CJ6G99QG&lt;/ref&gt;

RTE's ''Real Food Campaign'', directed by Dan Kittredge, is a project promoting nutrient rich food and creating a new standard for food quality. Award-winning ecological designer, Dr. [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], of [[Ocean Arks International]] directs RTE's Agroforestry Project in [[Costa Rica]], a project [[intercropping]] commercial [[hardwoods]], fruit trees and [[jatropha]], which produces a sustainable [[biofuel]] while regenerating the soil.

===Sustainable Ecological Earth Regeneration===

Inspired by Hamaker, in the 1990s, Cameron and Moira Thomson set up the [[charitable trust]] Sustainable Ecological Earth Regeneration (SEER)[http://www.seercentre.org.uk] in [[Scotland]], to develop the ideas which Hamaker founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angushorticulture.co.uk/images/Rock%20Dust%20Article%20In%20PM.pdf Stone Age Science: Rejuvenating The Earth With Rock Dust, Dylan Keating, Permaculture Magazine, Spring 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paul Kelbie's article ''Remineralization Might Save Us From Global Warming'',&lt;ref&gt;Remineralization Might Save Us From Global Warming, The Independent, Paul Kelbie, 21st March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in [[The Independent]], he wrote that since the last ice age, three million years ago, the Earth has gone through 25 glaciations, each lasting about 90,000 years, and that we are now 10,800 years into an interglacial&amp;nbsp;– a hiatus between ice–ages. Previous interglacials averaged 10 to 12,000 years in duration, with the most significant environmental change being interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession.&lt;ref&gt;Global Warming Triggers New Ice Age, Don Weaver, Living Nutrition Volume 4, 1997 "We must learn from the paleo-ecological and paleo-climatological evidence of past interglacial periods and their alternation with approximately 90,000 years average glacial periods within our current ice age."&lt;/ref&gt; Since this meant modern soils were relatively barren, leading to the adoption of imbalanced and artificial fertilisers, it was SEER's belief that by "By spreading the dust, we are doing in minutes what the earth takes thousands of years to do&amp;nbsp;– putting essential minerals in the rocks back into the earth." SEER won funding from the [[Scottish Executive]] to conduct the UK's first official rock dust trials, and maintained that rock dust could fight climate change because [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] in the dust converts carbon in the [[air]] into [[carbonates]], in addition to enhanced [[biosequestration]] by soil organisms and vegetation. The theory captured the attention of [[NASA]] who were researching the growing of plants on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;Lunar Base Agriculture: Soils For Plant Growth&amp;nbsp;– D. Ming &amp; D. Henninger, American Society of Agronomy (1989), {{ISBN|0-89118-100-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For SEER, as well as producing high yields, and re-balancing the Earth's ecology and [[geophysiology]], rock dusting also brought nutritional benefits due to the enrichment of crops, and so benefits to human health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardening-guy.com/stories/storyReader$37 On a Fad Diet of Rock Dust, How the Garden Does Grow Henry Homeyer, June 24, 2004, ''New York Times''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

But the SEER centre has been frustrated in their hopes to provide [[scientific proof]] of their claims for higher yields and enriched crops, through the use of rock dust. Their 3-year [[flagship]] [[research programme]] with [[Glasgow University]] (2009) found that rock dust made no difference to [[crop yield]] or nutrient-content in the test conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theses.gla.ac.uk/617/ The use of rock dust and composted materials as soil fertility amendments, Nicola Campbell (2009) Glasgow University]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regenerate The Earth===
In 2002, 20 years after Hamaker's book was published, Donald Weaver produced ''To Love And Regenerate The Earth'', an update on Hamaker's book, which was published by Remineralize The Earth&lt;ref&gt;''To Love &amp; Regenerate The Earth'', Don Weaver, Remineralize The Earth, 2002, http://www.remineralize.org&lt;/ref&gt; and re-published in 2006 by Soiland Health.org.&lt;ref&gt;''To Love &amp; Regenerate The Earth'', Don Weaver, SoilandHealth.org, 2006, http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010147tlarte.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The new book clarified ideas raised in the original book whilst providing new evidence from the 1990s and 2000s to show the direction of climate and environmental change.

Weaver considered Hamaker a broad [[synthesist]] in the fields of ecology and climate, who recognized how the forests and the [[trees]] integrated with the whole [[biological]]-tectonic-climatic Earth system. For Weaver and Hamaker, a new glacial period, one in a long series of glacial periods, was due in the geological and glacial-interglacial cycle timeframe. Weaver explained that Hamaker was convinced that [[human]]ity was rushing into the next glacial period due to carbon dioxide build-up after the normal interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession, as summarized by [[Johannes Iversen]] and Svend Andersen, [[Sovereign state|State]] [[Geologists]] from [[Denmark]] in the book ''The Holocene'' by Neil Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Svend, 1966, The Palaeobotanist 15:117; Andersen, Svend, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interglacial vegetation and soil development, Medd. Dansk Geol. Foren, Kovenhavn, Bind 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Retrogressive development of a forest ecosystem demonstrated by pollen, Iversen, J., 1969, Oikos Supplement, 12, 35-49, Copenhagen&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute For A Future===

In the mid-1980s, author, and [[Harvard]] [[clinical psychologist]], Dr. Larry Ephron, set up the U.S. based Institute For A Future and wrote ''The End: The Coming Ice Age &amp; How We Can Stop It'',&lt;ref&gt;The End: The Coming Ice Age &amp; How We Can Stop It&amp;nbsp;– Larry Ephron Ph.D., California: Celestial Arts, 1988, {{ISBN|0-89087-507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examined the theory and themes raised in Hamaker's book&lt;ref&gt;"Given Hamaker's position as an outsider who doesn't publish in the right journals, his work was almost bound to be dismissed. It would not be easy for the scientific establishment to admit that an outsider might have solved the ice age problem." ''The End'', Larry Ephron, California: Celestial Arts, 1988, chapter ''The Political Climate''&lt;/ref&gt; citing climatologist Reid Bryson, of the University of Wisconsin: "Breakthrought never come from within the establishment."&lt;ref&gt;''The End'' by Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, California, 1988, {{ISBN|0-89087-507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book specifically examined man's influence on [[nature]] and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;"Record cold winters again and again; increasing floods, hurricanes and tornadoes; dying forests; massive fossil fuel burning; and the clearcutting of the tropical rainforests. All these may be related. The next ice age may be virtually upon us&amp;nbsp;– a natural 100,000 year cycle which we are accelerating in many ways. If we act very quickly, we may be able to stop the ice ages. If not, we may stop eating." ''The End'' by Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, California, 1988, {{ISBN|0-89087-507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics covered included [[astrophysics]], climatology, geology, glaciology, [[microbiology]], [[paleobotany]], [[paleontology]], [[palynology]], [[plate tectonics]], soil remineralization, [[seismology]], soil science, [[solar physics]] and human survival.

Ephron showed how climatologists such as [[John Gribbin]] and [[Stephen Schneider]] who recognized the connection between global warming and the buildup of snow and ice, saw ice buildup only as a side effect of continued overall warming, rather than linking {{CO2}} increase, global warming, ice buildup, glaciation and [[ice ages]], together. An exception was Pierre Lehman, a [[Swiss]] [[atmospheric physicist]] who noted the important link between soil and climate.&lt;ref&gt;"Hamaker has at least made an attempt to put the climatic issue on a broader basis not very different from the Gaia approach of Jim Lovelock. Climate, biosphere and tectonic systems form an indissociable whole and condition each other. The biosphere and the atmosphere are interlocked in a permanent exchange of matter (carbon in particular) and energy which makes it impossible for the one not to be influenced by the other. So the soil fertility is a contributor to the climate." The Political Climate, in The End, Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; NASA climatologist [[James Hansen]] was also noted as saying "it is not certain whether {{CO2}} warming will cause the ice sheets to shrink or grow. For example, if the ocean warms but the air above the ice sheets remains below freezing, the effect could be increased snowfall, net ice sheet growth."&lt;ref&gt;The Political Climate, in The End, Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, [[Dave Foreman]], Founder of [[Earth First!]] wrote: "An ice age is coming, and I welcome it as a much needed cleansing. I see no possible solution to our ruination of Earth except for a drastic reduction of the human population." Also quoted is S. W. Matthews, Assistant Editor, ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'': "The ice age, which has really not left the planet for two million years, is reasserting itself. The warm time... is over. The next great return of ice has begun." and Paul Gersper, Professor of Soil Science, University of California: "The actions recommended here are urgently needed to avoid global disaster."

A film was made of the book called ''Stopping The Ice Age''&lt;ref&gt;Stopping The Coming Ice Age, 1988, Institute For A Future, Director: Larry Ephron&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988, which Ephron co-produced and directed. Like the book, it carried endorsements from various scientists and [[universities]] including Kenneth Watt, Professor of [[Environmental Studies]], [[University of California]]: "An astonishing service for humanity" and [[recording artist]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]: "Everybody has to see this". Ephron's writing on the ice age threat also appeared in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' and Acres USA.

===New Energy Movement===

In the 1980s, a contemporary of Hamaker, Alden Bryant,&lt;ref&gt;''Broken Planet, Broken Dreams'', Alden Bryant, Earth Regeneration Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Whose World to Lose?'', Alden Bryant, Earth Regeneration Society, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; founded a campaign organization called Earth Regeneration Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20091221082526/http://www.earthregenerationsociety.org/] with former [[IBM]] [[engineer]] Fred Wood, Barbara Logan and others, advocating global soil remineralization, reforestation, carbon dioxide reduction and a [[Alternative energy|new energy]] movement. After attending many international conferences on climate issues, Bryant set up the New Energy Movement organization.[http://www.newenergymovement.org]

==Further proponents==
Several books citing remineralization have been published including ''The Tree War: How to Save the Earth and Bring Together the Nations'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Tree War: How to save the earth and bring together the nations'', Barry Lynes, Mass: Springfield, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Enlivened Rock Powders'',&lt;ref&gt;The Enlivened Powders, Harvey Lisle, Acres USA, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Secrets of the Soil'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Secrets of the Soil: New Solutions for Restoring Our Planet'', Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird (Arkana,  1992), {{ISBN|0-14-019311-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Empty Harvest''&lt;ref&gt;Empty Harvest: understanding the link Between Our Food, Our Immunity, and Our Planet, Dr. Bernard Jensen &amp; Mark Anderson, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Secret Life Of Plants''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret Life of Plants'', Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, HarperPerennial 1989, {{ISBN|0-06-091587-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, [[Peter von Fragstein]] of the [[University of Kassel]], Germany, began researching remineralization with many different rock types as a slow-release [[fertilizer]] and to deter insects.

Hamaker's research also complemented work by [[Bill Mollison]]&lt;ref&gt;Permaculture: A Designers' Manual: A Designer's Manual by Bill Mollison and Andrew Jeeves, Tagari Publications, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; on permaculture, John Jeavons&lt;ref&gt;How to Grow More Vegetables: And Fruits, Nuts, Berries, Grains, and Other Crops Than You Can Imagine, John Jeavons, Ten Speed Press; 7th Revised edition (30 Nov 2006), {{ISBN|1-58008-796-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] on sustainable organiculture, [[Emilia Hazelip]] on synergistic agriculture and [[Rudolf Steiner]] on biodynamic farming. It further brought interest from science writer Philip Callaghan&lt;ref&gt;Paramagnetism: Rediscovering Nature's Secret Force of Growth, Philip Callahan, Halcyon House Publishers; 1998&lt;/ref&gt; who developed the rock dusting theme in his work on paramagnetism, a field related to [[radionics]], [[biophotonics]], bio-energetics, bio-resonance, Schumann waves, magnetometeorology and [[subtle energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paramountgrowth.com/images/rockdust_sdiver01.pdf Rock Dusts in Agriculture: Insights on Remineralization and Paramagnetism by Steve Diver]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the [[Men of the Trees]] organization in [[Australia]] conducted remineralization trials on many [[species]] of trees in [[Australia]] with significant results, such as five times the growth of tree [[seedlings]] of one variety of [[eucalyptus]], compared to the untreated controls.

Barry Lynes wrote ''Climate Crime'' in 1985 chronicling the case for global cooling,&lt;ref&gt;''Climate Crime'', Barry Lynes, Tree War Assembly, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Felix, author of ''Not by Fire But By Ice'' echoed concerns about re-[[glaciation]], expressed by Hamaker and Bryant, which he documented at Ice Age Now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kortexplores.com/node/80, The Ice Is Coming, Kort Patterson, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.iceagenow.com]

In the 2000s, [[NCAR]] scientist Dr. Lee Klinger [http://www.suddenoaklifeorg.wordpress.com] began to investigate the relationship between rock dust and plant growth to save dying trees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remineralize.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=47 Minerals for Ageing Soils - Lee Klinger at Remineralize.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remineralize.org/saving_california_oaks.pdf Klinger uses remineralization to restore dying trees at Remineralize.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;suddenoaklife.org&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]] began to experiment with [[lunar soil]], plant growth and hydrophonics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/plantgrowth/home/index.html Lunar Plant Growth Challenge, NASA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Alanna Moore wrote the book ''Stone Age Farming: Eco-Agriculture for the 21st Century''&lt;ref&gt;Stone Age Farming: Eco Agriculture For the 21st Century, Alanna Moore, Python Press, Australia (1 Jul 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; which combined remineralization with permaculture for a new eco-agricultural [[paradigm]].

In 2005, Allan Yeomans&lt;ref&gt;Priority One: Together We Can Beat Global Warming, Allan J. Yeomans, Biosphere Media, 2007, 700 pages, {{ISBN|0-9794799-3-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented in ''Priority One'', the potential to bring atmospheric carbon to pre-industrial levels within 5 years, through remineralization of the world's agricultural lands. For Yeoman, as well as reducing global {{CO2}} levels to safe levels, it would revitalize the soil and biological life on the planet, and increase human nutrition and health levels.

In 2006, British author, Graham Harvey,&lt;ref&gt;We Want Real Food by Graham Harvey, Constable, 2006, {{ISBN|1-84529-267-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced the book ''We Want Real Food'' which documented the results of remineralization, in terms of soil health and nutritional values in food, and documented major declines in the mineral content of crops.

==Rocks for Crops==
In 2007, the research organization Rocks for Crops&lt;ref&gt;''Agrogeology: The Use of Rocks for Crops'', Peter Von Straaten, Enviroquest Ltd 2007, {{ISBN|0-9680123-5-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.uoguelph.ca/rocks] was initiated by soil scientist, Jairo Restrepo Rivera of the University of [[Pelotas]], Río Grande del Sur ([[Brazil]]), who translated ''Bread From Stones'' into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and gave conferences on remineralization in [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]]; Peter Von Straaten from the University of [[Guelph]] ([[Canada]]); and Suzi Teodoro from the University of [[Brasilia]] ([[Brazil]]).

The group confirmed that a branch of geology called '''agrogeology''', originating at the University of Guelph, was evolving, since Von Straaten published the book ''Agrogeology: The Use of Rocks for Crops'' and Rivera produced the book and [[video]], ''Manual Práctico ABC de la Agricultura Orgánica y Harina de Rocas'',&lt;ref&gt;''Manual Práctico ABC de la Agricultura Orgánica y Harina de Rocas'', Jairo Restrepo Rivera, Ventas Publicaciones/COAS, Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; which described how to regenerate overcultivated soils with rock dust. The science was developing in Germany, [[Canada]] and USA, and being researched in Brazil, [[Tanzania]] and the [[Canary Islands]]. Other university researchers included professors William Fyfe and Ward Chesworth.

The science of agrogeology is the study of natural geological materials suitable for restoring soils as an alternative to chemical fertilizers, particularly for worn out tropical soils. Due to intense tropical [[rainfall]], chemical fertilizers are washed away from [[laterite]] soils within weeks, and cannot be stored by the soils, are thus especially harmful to the [[groundwater]]. Rock fertilizers supply nutrients over longer periods to cultivated plants. When the rocks break down, new minerals are made available to the soil micro-organisms and whole soil-food web. From the soil chemist's perspective, the process improves the [[ion-exchange]] capacity of soils while forming new clay minerals.&lt;ref&gt;"The total ionic charge that can be held in a soil. The number of positively or negatively charged sites in a soil body.", ''Cation Exchange Capacity'', http://www.tereco.sr.unh.edu/definitions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, a Rocks for Crops conference was held in Brasilia with 170 participants to discuss the new [[science]]. Further conferences were held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and in [[Mexico]], in December 2009 for the study and promotion of remineralization worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;First International Conference on Rock Dust and Soil Health, University of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Hamaker conducted the groundwork for a mass movement of people concerned about the health of the world's soils, sustainable forests, climate change and improved nutrition from food. His proposal, [[rock dust]]ing, known to enhance plant growth by nourishing biological and chemical aspects of the rhizosphere, resulted in [[soil regeneration]] to boost global plant cover. This assisted Earth's self-regulation and offered a more natural [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] solution to the climate crisis not dependent on [[high technology]], or on-going climate manipulation by man.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society’s Report on Geoengineering the Climate: Geoengineering or Geopiracy?, Sep 4 2009, ETC Group, Canada, etcgroup.org&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists have postulated that [[technological]] solutions may exist to assist the remineralization process, such as converting carbon dioxide into [[organic carbon]] to be mineralized as [[sediment]] before being weathered to soil.

==Writings==
Hamaker's main book was ''The Survival Of Civilization'' (1983, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remineralize.org/don/synopsis01.html ''The Survival Of Civilization'', John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers, 1983, Remineralize The Earth 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; He also produced various articles and publications from the 1960s to the 1990s. His ideas were further elucidated by Donald A. Weaver in his book ''To Love &amp; Regenerate The Earth'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010147tlarte.pdf ''To Love &amp; Regenerate The Earth'', Donald Weaver, Remineralize The Earth, 2002, republished by Soil and Health 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and in articles for publications including ''Living Nutrition'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Whole Life Systems Depend On Healthy Soil, Don Weaver, Living Nutrition Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mother Earth's Call To Humanity: Help Me Regenerate Now, Living Nutrition Magazine, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingnutrition.com/article_samples/global.html Global Warming Triggers Ice Age, Remineralization Connection, Don Weaver, Living Nutrition Magazine, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What Should We Do About Climate Change?, Don Weaver, Living Nutrition Magazine, December 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restoring Our Earth To Vibrant Health, Don Weaver, Vibrance, Number 1, Spring 2008&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the publication of the e-book "Regenerate the Earth!: Nature's Call to Remineralize Our Soil, Re-Green Our Land, Rescue Our Climate and Restore Our Health" by Vibrance!,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vibranthealthandwealth.com/vibrance&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. Weaver remains involved in education campaigns to alert humanity to the climate crisis and foundational rock dust solution.

==Criticisms==

===Energy===

Hamaker's hypothesis is criticised because [[fossil fuel]] energy is potentially required to create and distribute rock dust, and this generates {{CO2}} when derived from fossil fuel, however, rock dust is predominantly a byproduct of the existing aggregate and quarrying industries &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.championtrees.org/topsoil/PitnQuarry.htm Soil remineralization: a future market for aggregate industry fines, Robert J. Able, June 1995, ''Pit &amp; Quarry'']&lt;/ref&gt; Future rock dust production for broad-scale soil remineralization can be powered by renewable sources, such as wind energy and bio-fuels grown on remineralized soils.

===Climate control===

Since land is naturally fertilized in glacial periods, remineralizing the Earth would emulate the glaciation process, allowing the reversal of what Hamaker and Weaver referred to as the ''interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession'' (decline in the [[NDVI|vegetative index]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Survival of Civilization'', John Hamaker, Hamaker Weaver Publishers, 198&lt;/ref&gt; They reasoned that this would indefinitely sustain the interglacial ecosystem and climate, or at least slow down the speed of re-glaciation. However, scientists such as Mukul Sharmar,&lt;ref&gt;100,000-year Climate Pattern Linked To Sun's Magnetic Cycles, Professor Mukul Sharma, Dept. Earth Sciences, Dartmouth College, 2002, http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2002/june/060602.html&lt;/ref&gt; Charles A.

Swvensmark, Friis-Christensen and Lassen (Science 254, 698).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Chizhevsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Solar Activity &amp; The Biosphere: Heliobiology. From A.L. Chizhevsky To The Present by Boris M. Vladimirsky, N.A. Temuryants/Temurjants. Foreword &amp; Editor: Prof. L. Blyumenfeld, Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. 1999. 30 pages, 93 figures, 24 tables, and Bibliography with 500 items. Distributed by: International Independent Ecological &amp; Politological University, Zdanie MEI Moscow Power Generation Institute Building, Moscow, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; who have cited variations in the sunspot cycle as the dominant mechanism in climate cycles on Earth, not vegetation,&lt;ref&gt;The Deniers: The World Renowned Scientists Who Stood Up Against Global Warming Hysteria, Political Persecution, and Fraud&amp;nbsp;– and Those Who are Too Fearful to Do So by Lawrence Solomon, Richard Vigilante Books, 2008, {{ISBN|0-9800763-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Link Between Solar Cycle &amp; Earth's Climate'', Nexus, Volume 4, Number 4, June 1999; Science, April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sun and Earth: A New View of Climate&amp;nbsp;– Jack Sauers, 21st Century Science &amp; Technology Magazine, Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt; have yet to incorporate the demineralization dimension.

More than a [[mini ice age]] in 2013-2041, Hamaker's immediate concern was the shortening of the growing season from the coming glacial period, which he believed could be forestalled through rock dusting, resulting in more abundant yields at [[harvest]]. He believed the coming glacial period would preceded by an interglacial-to-glacial transition phase already underway since the 1970s, and strongly advocated an intensive global co-operative soil remineralization effort to maintain the quantity of food while improving its quality. To achieve this, he recommended simultaneous remineralization of dying forests and soils, also needed to grow bio-fuels, as part of a goal to return excessive carbon dioxide to stable interglacial levels of 280 ppm.

There are four languages with official status in [[Catalonia]] (an [[autonomous community]] of [[Spain]]): [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]- which is official throughout [[Spain]]; [[Aranese]], a [[dialect]] of [[Occitan]] spoken in the [[Aran Valley]]; and [[Catalan Sign Language]].&lt;ref name="estatut_langs"&gt;[http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826045656/http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf |date=2013-08-26 }}, Article 50, paragraph 6. Retrieved 2012-08-24. "The public authorities shall guarantee the use of Catalan sign language and conditions of equality for deaf people who chooses to use this language, which shall be the subject of education, protection and respect."&lt;/ref&gt; Many other languages are spoken in Catalonia as a result of recent immigration from all over the world.

Catalan has enjoyed special status since the approval of the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]] which declares it to be the language "proper to Catalonia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528011550/http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6 |date=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish had been the only official language for most of the period between the 18th century and 1975.

According to a 2008 survey,&lt;ref name="idescat.cat" /&gt; in everyday use, 45.9% of the population usually spoke Spanish, while 35.6% usually employed Catalan, and 12% of the population used either language habitually.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-catalunya-arabe-urdu-aparecen-lenguas-habituales-catalunya-creando-peligro-guetos-20090629150020.html |title=Árabe y urdu aparecen entre las lenguas habituales de Catalunya, creando peligro de guetos |publisher=Europapress.es |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2015-04-10|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 45% of respondents used Spanish to address their parents (versus 36% who choose Catalan).&lt;ref name="idescat.cat"/&gt; This is attributed to extensive migration from other areas in Spain during the second half of the 20th century, as a consequence of which many Catalans have one or both parents born outside Catalonia. However, a majority (52.6%) used Catalan with their children (compared to 42.3% for Spanish). This can be attributed to some Spanish-speaking citizens shifting from their native language to Catalan at home.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Outside the family, 48.6% of the population indicated that they addressed strangers exclusively or preferentially in Catalan, while the proportion of those who used Spanish was 41.7%, and 8.6% claimed to use both equally.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Social origin of the language diversity ===
The main cause of Spanish and Catalan social [[bilingualism]] in modern Catalonia was large-scale migration from the rest of Spain during the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant [[industrialization]] which demanded an increased [[workforce]] from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} "While the repressive policy of the central authorities had an undeniably negative impact on Catalan use and even on Catalan competence (e.g. an entire generation went through school without any opportunity to acquire or polish Catalan literacy, a limitation that has very recognizable consequences to this very day among most older Catalans), an indirect development of those same years has had even more massive and more devastating consequences for the language. Catalonia had long been one of the most economically advanced areas of Spain and, as a result, its cities (most particularly Barcelona) had long attracted unemployed Spaniards from the rest of the country. These immigrants came in numbers that did not demographically swamp the indigenous (or indigenized) Catalans, and within a generation or more the latest newcomers too were recurringly Catalanized. [...] However, the immigration that transpired between 1950 and 1975 was so huge, relative to Catalonia’s absorptive capacity, that the rather effortless and rapid ethnolinguistic transformation of its members that had formerly been the rule was no longer possible.

The economic consequences of the rapid addition of nearly one and a half million unskilled immigrants to the previous two and a half million 'native Catalans' were not seriously problematic ones for the host population. [...] However, the cultural and intercultural consequences became doubly problematic as social class differences compounded the ethnolinguistic differences separating the two populations. Even now, decades after the end of massive immigration (an immigration that would have been even larger had not whole trainloads of newcomers been turned back prior to their arrival) only slightly more than half of the adult population of Catalonia habitually speaks Catalan, a percentage which is halved again in the immigrant 'industrial belt' surrounding Barcelona where Spanish-speaking newcomers and their children, many of the latter born in Catalonia, are overwhelmingly concentrated."&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish has historically been spoken among a minority of civil servants born in other regions in Spain and among segments of the wealthiest bourgeoisie. Spanish has also been spoken as a second language by most Catalans, as it has been the only official language over long periods since the eighteenth century.

It has been calculated that the total population of Catalonia with no migration would have grown from 2 million people in 1900 to just 2.4 million in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ced.uab.cat/publicacions/PapersPDF/Text183.pdf Anna Cabré: ''Immigration and welfare state'' (in Catalan)] Ced.uab.es (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; 39% of the real population of 6.1 million for that date, which was over 7.5 million in 2016. As a consequence, there exists a somewhat different identity for those whose native language is Catalan and those whose native language is Spanish,&lt;ref name=Strubell1&gt;
"...una societat que, en encetar-se el procés, es trobava escindida entre la població d’origen autòcton, de primera llengua catalana quasi sense excepcions, i la d’origen immigrant, molt majoritàriament monolingüe hispanòfona."

L’"admirable inversió" del català a les escoles de Catalunya (in Catalan)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to anthropologist [[Kathryn Woolard]], who has studied these identities, Catalans tend to classify anyone as either ''castellà'' (that is, having Spanish as their native language) or ''català'' (that is, having Catalan as their native language).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The claim that the population would have only increased 20% from 1900 to 1980 is disputable since the population of Spain as a whole doubled from 18 to 37 million even allowing for high levels of emigration from the province to the Western Hemisphere and Europe.

== Statistics ==

According to the linguistic census elaborated by the Government of Catalonia corresponding to 2008, 45.92% of citizens over 15 years old declared Spanish as their [only] habitual language of use, versus 35.64% for Catalan, with 11.95% of complete bilinguals; a larger number claims Catalan as "their own language" (37.25% Catalan compared to 46.53% Spanish and 8.81% bilinguals).&lt;ref name="idescat.cat"/&gt;

Lastly, since the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]], [[Aranese]]—a [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan language|Occitan]] dialect—has been official and subject to special protection in the [[Aran Valley]]. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants was the only place where Occitan (spoken mainly in France and some Italian valleys) received full official status. However, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Aranese became official throughout Catalonia.

==Spanish==
{{Main|Linguistic features of Spanish language spoken by Catalan-speakers|Spanish language}}

According to the government of Catalonia, Spanish, locally known as Castilian, is currently the most spoken language in Catalonia (45.9% daily users of Spanish vs. 35.6% daily users of Catalan vs. 11% daily users of both Spanish and Catalan) and especially in the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]], as well as native language and usual language of many Catalan citizens. This language is widely prevalent in the press, cinema and in daily life.

Spanish is the language that Catalan citizens can read and write the most, due to the fact that until the 1980s it was the only language used in school and in all official communications.

The Spanish language developed from [[Vulgar Latin]] in the North of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], expanding quickly to the South. It has lexical influences from [[Arabic]] and possible [[Substratum|substrate]] influences from [[Basque language|Basque]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]]. It has been the only official language in Spain for most periods since the eighteenth century.

==Catalan==
{{Main|Catalan language}}
According to the official government of Catalonia, Catalan is the second most spoken language of the region, after Spanish (over 35% of Catalans use exclusively Catalan as their first language, while 11% of Catalans use equally both Catalan and Spanish). It is the most spoken language in many [[comarques of Catalonia|comarques]] of Catalonia, with the exception of the Barcelona metropolitan area ([[Barcelonès]] plus surrounding comarques) and [[Camp de Tarragona]]. Catalan is a compulsory subject in schools and enjoys equals rights with Spanish throughout Catalonia.

Since the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] and the approval of a new democratic Constitution in Spain, Catalan has experienced a new revival in its usage, first, due to the liberalisation and devolution of the Catalan linguistic and cultural institutions, and second, to their promotion. However, some political activists claim that Catalan-speaking people continue suffering some types of discrimination, as explained in the European Parliament on January 29, 2014. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Catalan, a [[Romance language]], is regarded by some Iberian [[linguistics|linguists]] as belonging to the [[Iberian Romance languages|Iberian Romance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proel.org/mundo/catalan.htm |title=Hemos renovado nuestra página y este fichero ya no existe, pero estamos redirigiéndole a la nueva ubicación |publisher=Proel.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; sub-family (which also includes Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, and Aragonese), while others (especially Occitanists) classify it within the [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbilat.com/Languages/Catalan/Catalan.html |title=Catalan Language |publisher=Orbilat.com |date=1990-12-11 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; sub-family (which includes [[French language|French]], [[Occitan]] and [[Gallo-Italian]]) languages. It shares attributes with both linguistic groups.

===Literacy===
According to the 2001 Linguistic Census,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/socio/docs/censling2001.pdf |accessdate=August 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108233606/http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/socio/docs/censling2001.pdf |archivedate=November 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 5,900,000 people in Catalonia (nearly 95% of the population) understand the Catalan language. The percentage of people aged two and older who can speak, read and write Catalan is as follows:

As a result of the ongoing linguistic [[affirmative action|policies favouring]] Catalan, implemented in various degrees by the autonomous government during the last 20 years, knowledge of Catalan has advanced significantly in all these areas, with the ability to write it having experienced the most pronounced increase, from 31.6% of the population in 1986 to 49.8% in 2001.

By age groups, those between 10 and 29 have the highest level of Catalan-language literacy (e.g., 98.2% aged 10&amp;ndash;14 understand it, and 85.2% can write it); this is attributed to these individuals having received their education in Catalan.

Geographically, Catalan is understood in northwest Catalonia ([[High Pyrenees]], [[Aran Valley]]), at 97.4%, followed by south and western Catalonia, whereas [[Barcelona]]'s metropolitan area sees the lowest knowledge, at 93.8%.  The situation is analogous for written-language skills, with central Catalonia scoring the highest percentages (61.4%), and Barcelona the lowest (46.4%).

Barcelona is one of the main centres of the Spanish publishing industry for both Spanish-language and Catalan-language publishing.

==Aranese==
{{Main|Aranese dialect|Occitan language}}

According to the 2001 [[Aranese]] Linguistic Census,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/aran/docs/a_aran_cens.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626042846/http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/aran/docs/a_aran_cens.pdf |date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge of Aranese in the Occitan-speaking territory of Aran is as follows:

Compared to previous data from 1996, the number of those able to understand Aranese has declined slightly (90.5% in 1996), while at the same time there has been a marginal increase in the number of those able to write it (24.97% in 1996).

By age groups, the largest percentage of those with knowledge of Aranese is in the 15-19 and 65-69 groups (both above 96%), while those aged 30–34 score lowest (just over 80%).  Literacy is higher in the 10-19 group with over 88% declaring themselves able to read, and 76% able to write Aranese. Those over 80 are the least literate, with only about 1.5% of them being able to write the language.

In everyday use, according to 2008 data, Spanish is the main language in the Aran valley, habitually spoken by 38% of the population, then followed by Aranese, spoken by 23.4% of the population. In Aran, Catalan is the third language, habitually spoken by 16% of the population.&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt;

==Catalan Sign Language==
{{Main|Catalan Sign Language}}

According to [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=csc Ethnologue], about 18,000 [[Deaf culture|deaf]] Catalans use Catalan Sign Language (LSC, ''Llengua de signes catalana''). Since, like other [[deaf sign languages]], LSC has no generally used written form, there is no literacy data.

==Immigrant languages in Catalonia==
{{Main|Immigration to Spain}}

As a part of the intense immigration process which Spain in general and Catalonia in particular have experienced over the last decade, there is a large number of [[immigrant language]]s spoken in various cultural communities in Catalonia, of which ([[Maghrebi Arabic|Maghrebi]]) [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hindustani language|Urdu]] are the most common&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt; if Spanish-speaking migrants are not taken into account.

From all four [[Outline of Catalonia#Provinces of Catalonia|Provinces of Catalonia]], the largest number of habitual foreign language speakers are located in [[Girona (province)|Girona]].&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt;

==Political and social issues==
Under the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] dictatorship Catalan was, until the 1970s, excluded from the state education system and all other official and governmental use, including the prohibition of baptizing children with certain Catalan names. [[Rural-urban migration]] originating in other parts of Spain reduced the social use of the language in urban areas. Lately, a similar [[sociolinguistic]] phenomenon has occurred with foreign immigration. In an attempt to reverse this, the re-established self-government institutions of Catalonia embarked on a long term [[language policy]] to increase the use of Catalan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=li0Fmtfxd6kC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;ots=wZKdr8Yxeq&amp;dq=linguistic+policy+Catalonia&amp;sig=_XXKHeB8_QEDLJDSTjLGsPrlLYE |title=Multilingualism in Spain: Sociolinguistic and Psycholinguistic Aspects of ... |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1994-07-30 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has, since 1983, enforced laws which attempt to protect, and extend, the use of Catalan.

The [[language policy]] favouring Catalan consistently implemented by the successive governments ruling the regional government of Catalonia since the 1980s has become increasingly contentious and controversial during the 2000s, especially in [[public education]].

In this context, Catalan was the only language of instruction between 1979 and 2012. Thus, pupils were [[language immersion|immersed in Catalan]] except for three hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. However, the most recent Spanish Education Law and some judicial sentences aim at increasing the time of instruction in Spanish for other subjects, if only one child per class asks it, even if the other families don't agree, because of complaints that current policies hinder the right to an education in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136059.htm |title=2009 Human Rights Report: Spain |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political parties and civic organizations denounce this situation in which a co-official language like Spanish is barred from public education, claiming that this is a severe breach of civic rights and against the spirit of free circulation of people within Spain. In September 2008 a demonstration was held in Barcelona to support full coexistence of both languages without linguistic discrimination of either.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20081001044632/http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20080928/53550121278.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012 the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] ruled that schools must also use Spanish as a medium of instruction, if parents wish it, and cannot force Catalan-language education on the entire population, citing the disadvantage of the inability {{Clarify|date=September 2012}} to be educated in the national language and the necessity of maintaining the ability for citizens to move from one part of Spain to another without learning the local language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20120701/54319269947/catalan-bajo-prision.html |title=La lengua catalana, bajo presión |publisher=Lavanguardia.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-Catalan language activists claim that some activities cannot be done in Catalan, because almost 500 different rules&lt;ref name="plataforma-llengua.cat"/&gt; are forbidding the use of any language except Spanish or because delegations of the Spanish Government do not accept the use of documents written in Catalan, though it is a co-official language in Catalonia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">{{Politics of Morocco}}
'''Makhzen''' ([[Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|المخزن}}, [[Berber language|Berber]]: ''Lmexzen'') is the governing institution in [[Morocco]] and in [[Beylik of Tunis|pre-1957 Tunisia]], centered on the king and consisting of royal notables, top-ranking military personnel, landowners, security service bosses, civil servants and other well-connected members of the [[The Establishment|establishment]]. The term "Makhzen" is also popularly used in Morocco as a word meaning "State" or "Government".

==Etymology==

The word ''makhzen'' ({{lang-ar|مخزن}}) literally means "warehouse" in [[Maghrebi Arabic]] (from ''khazana'' "to store up"&lt;ref&gt;[[NOAD]]&lt;/ref&gt;), where the king's civil servants used to receive their wages; but this usage of the word became in [[Moroccan Arabic]] synonymous with the elite. It is likely a [[metonymy]] related to [[tax]]es, which the ''makhzen'' used to collect; the term may also refer to the state, but this usage is increasingly rare and is primarily used by the older generation. Recently, the term is also being used to describe the police.

The word has also been adopted into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] with a different meaning, as ''almacén'' and ''armazém'' (with addition of the [[Arabic definite article]]), and into [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] as ''magasin'' (meaning "store") and ''magazzino''. It came into the [[English language]] from [[Middle French]] as ''magazine'', originally referring to a [[magazine (artillery)|storehouse]] for ammunition and later to [[magazine|publications]].  With the "store" meaning, it was also adopted from French into [[Russian language|Russian]] as ''[[:ru:Магазин]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/magazine |title=‘Magazine’ |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018 |website=Oxford Living Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=4 May 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Berber culture of Morocco, the Berber equivalent of "mekhzen" (warehouse) would be ''agadir''. Berber tribes also considered the ''agadir'' (warehouse of the tribe's crops and valuables) as a powerhouse guarded and managed through a legal system. The Arabic word "makhzen" is probably a translation of the original Berber word "agadir".

==Makhzen in Morocco==
The Makhzen is a very ancient notion in Morocco, it roughly coincides with the notion of the feudal state predating the [[French protectorate in Morocco]]. "Bilād al-makhzen" (the land of the makhzen) was the term used to describe the areas under central government authority, while those areas still run by tribal authority were known as "bilād as-siba" (the land of dissidence).&lt;ref name="HoursAhmed2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bernard Hours|author2=Pepita Ould Ahmed|title=An Anthropological Economy of Debt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6noGCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT83|date=10 April 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-49708-0|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubert Lyautey]], who served as resident-general of Morocco from 1912 until 1925 during the era of the protectorate, was a fervent proponent of indirect colonisation, especially in [[Berber languages|Berber]]-speaking areas. Lyautey maintained the role of the Makhzen and even enhanced it by giving important roles to local notables such as [[Thami El Glaoui]]. Local notables acted as a relay between the population and the French authorities.&lt;ref name="Hamadal-Anani2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.

'''New Socialist Party''' ({{lang-fr|Nouveau parti socialiste}}, NPS) is an organized [[caucus]] in the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]. The NPS made up part of the [[left-wing politics|left wing]] of the party. The NPS was founded in October 2002 by [[Arnaud Montebourg]], [[Vincent Peillon]], [[Julien Dray]] (former member of the [[Socialist Left (France)|Socialist Left]]) and [[Benoît Hamon]].

At the [[Dijon Congress]] in 2003, the NPS motion obtained 16.88%. At the 2005 [[Le Mans Congress]], the NPS motion obtained 23.54%. However, the NPS imploded following the Le Mans Congress, with [[Arnaud Montebourg]] founding the [[Renovate Now]] faction and Peillon, Hamon, and Emmanuelle continuing a rump NPS. 

The rump NPS split again before the [[Reims Congress]] in 2008, when Peillon left the NPS, which supported Benoît Hamon's motion, to support [[Ségolène Royal]]'s motion.

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''''Official Journal of the European Union''''' (the '''''OJ''''') is the [[official gazette]] of record for the [[European Union]] (EU). It is published every working day in all of the [[Languages of the European Union|official languages of the]] [[Member state of the European Union|member states]]. Only legal acts published in the Official Journal are [[contract|binding]].

It was first published on 30 December 1952 as the ''Official Journal of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]''. This was renamed ''Official Journal of the European Communities'' with the establishment of the [[European Community]] before taking its current title when the [[Treaty of Nice]] [[coming into force|entered into force]] on 1 February 2003.  Since 1998 the Journal has been available online via the [[EUR-Lex]] service.

As of the 1st of July 2013, the electronic version of the Official Journal bears legal value instead of the paper version.  Each issue is published as a set of documents in [[PDF/A]] format (one per official language) plus one [[XML]] document ensuring the overall coherency through [[Hash function|hashes]] and a ''qualified electronic signature'' (a kind of [[digital signature]] defined in European law) extended with a [[Trusted timestamping|trusted time stamp]].

The Journal comprises two series:
* The '''L&amp;nbsp;series''' contains [[EU legislation]] including [[EU regulation|regulations]], [[EU directive|directives]], decisions, recommendations, and opinions.
* The '''C&amp;nbsp;series''' contains reports and announcements including the [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]s of the [[European Court of Justice]] and the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] (formerly known as the Court of First Instance).
There is also a supplementary '''S&amp;nbsp;series''' which contains invitations to tender, and other documents relating to the EU Procurement Directives (see: [[Government procurement in the European Union]]). The S&amp;nbsp;Series is also the only series that is not issued in every working language of the Union. Each contracting authority issues notices in the language of its choice.

Due to the decentralized nature of the project, several independent websites are participating in the effort. It is not clear how much co-ordination, if any, exists between these sites. A list follows:
* Cable Wiki:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cablewiki.net |title= Cable Wiki mainpage |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meant to serve as a wiki for the translation of cables to multiple languages, together with additional analysis of the cables
* Sinde Gate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sindegate.net/ |title= Sinde Gate mainpage |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; local group providing translations and explanations of cables related to the scandal "Wikileaks cables reveal that the US wrote Spain's proposed copyright law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2010/12/03/wikileaks-cables-rev.html |title= Wikileaks cables reveal that the US wrote Spain's proposed copyright law |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sinde Gate" is named after the name of the responsible Spanish minister.
* Operation Leakspin Quality Control:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qualitycontrol.operationleakspin.org/ |title=Operation Leakspin Quality Control |accessdate=2010-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214085731/http://qualitycontrol.operationleakspin.org/# |archive-date=14 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a forum for quality control on the translation/analysis of the cables.
* Operation Leakspin Blog:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://operationleakspin.org/ |title= Operation Leakspin Blog |accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a blog informing about the operation Leakspin.

== Goals ==
[[File:OperationLeakspin.jpg|thumb|Official Operation Leakspin [[propaganda]]]]

Leakspin represents a sharp departure from the tactics of [[Operation Payback]]. Rather than attacking perceived enemies of the pro-WikiLeaks movement, the sole focus is on propagating material determined to be of public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://godlesspaladin.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/operation-leakspin-28038-1291976227-1.jpg |title=Operation Leekspin |date=December 2010 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This potentially could lead to media outlets and the general public focusing on the issues uncovered by the released diplomatic cables rather than the morality or sensibility of [[DDoS]] attacks as a form of protest or [[Julian Assange]]'s current legal travails.

It is not clear if Operation Leakspin participants and organizers are working towards a massive global protest movement, such as Anonymous's [[Project Chanology]]. Several WikiLeaks-themed demonstrations have occurred globally, but appear to be isolated movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/julian-assange-protest-in-melbourne-sparks-peak-hour-commuter-chaos/story-e6frf7kx-1225969132559 Heraldsun.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to ascertain how much support Operation Leakspin has garnered in the [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] community.

== Legal questions ==
Although [[WikiLeaks]] and [[Julian Assange]] are potentially being targeted for criminal investigations in the United States in connection with releasing classified documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/12/17/wikileaks-new-york-times/ |publisher=Fox News |title=The New York Times Sleeps With the WikiLeaks Dogs and Now It's Got Fleas |date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no real possibility that Leakspin participants could be at legal risk in the USA due to the protections inherent in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Although arrests have taken place in connection with other pro-WikiLeaks actions,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eip-news.com/2010/12/hackers-shut-down-dutch-public-prosecution-website-after-arrest/ EIP-news.com{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have so far been no reports of any Leakspin websites or activists being investigated.

'''Political cinema''' in the narrow sense of the term is a cinema which portrays current or historical events or social conditions in a partisan way in order to inform or to agitate the spectator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Political cinema exists in different forms such as [[documentary film|documentaries]], feature films, or even animated and [[experimental film]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Notion==
Political cinema in the narrow sense of the term refers to political films which do not hide their political stance. This does not mean that they are necessarily pure [[propaganda]]. The difference to other films is not that they are political but how they show it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Even ostensibly "apolitical" escapist films, which promise "mere entertainment" as an escape from everyday life, however, fulfill a political function. The authorities in Nazi Germany knew this very well and organized a large production of deliberately escapist movies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In other entertainment movies, for example [[western (genre)|western]]s, the ideological bias is evident in the distortion of historical reality. A "classical" western would rarely portray black cowboys, although there were a great many of them. Hollywood Cinema or more generally speaking so called [[Dominant Cinema]], was often accused of misrepresenting black, women, gays and working-class people.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

More fundamentally not only the content of individual films is political but also the [[institution]] of cinema itself. A huge number of people congregate not to act together or to talk to each other but, after having paid for it, to sit silently, to be spectators separated from each other. (Of course the behaviour of the public is not always the same in all countries.) [[Guy Debord]], a critic of the society of the spectacle, for whom "separation is the alpha and omega of the spectacle" was therefore also violently opposed to Cinema, even though he would make several movies portraying his ideas.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Cinema, World War I and its aftermath==
Before World War I French cinema had a big share of the world market. Hollywood used the collapse of the French production to establish its [[hegemony]]. Ever since it has dominated world film production not only economically but has transformed cinema into a means to disseminate American values.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In Germany the [[Universum Film AG]], better known as UFA, was founded to counter the perceived dominance of western propaganda. During the Weimar Republic many films about [[Frederick II of Prussia]] had a conservative nationalistic agenda, as [[Siegfried Kracauer]] and other film critics noted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Communists like [[Willi Münzenberg]] saw the Russian cinema as a model of political cinema. Soviet films by [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Dziga Vertov]] and others combined a partisan view of the bolshevist regime with artistic innovation which also appealed to western audiences.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Film and National Socialism==
[[Leni Riefenstahl]] has never been able or willing to face her responsibility as a chief propagandist for National Socialism. Almost unlimited resources and her undeniable talent led to results which despite their hideous aims still fascinate some film aficionados. There is much controversy around her work, but it is generally accepted that Riefenstahl's main commitment was to moviemaking, rather than to the Nazi party. Proof of that might be seen by the portrayal of [[Jesse Owens]]' victory on the movie ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'' (about the Olympic games in [[Germany]]) and in her later work, mostly on her photographic expeditions to Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The same is certainly not true of the violently antisemite films of Fritz Hippler. Other Nazi political films made propaganda for so-called [[euthanasia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Forms==
Form has always been an important concern for political film makers. While some, like pioneering [[Lionel Rogosin]],  argued that radical films, in order to liberate the imagination of the spectator, have to break not only with the content but also with the form of Dominant cinema, the falsely reassuring clichés and stereotypes of conventional narrative film making, other directors such as [[Francesco Rosi]], [[Costa Gavras]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Oliver Stone]], [[Spike Lee]] or [[Lina Wertmüller]] preferred to work within mainstream cinema to reach a wider audience.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The subversive tradition dates back at least to the French [[avant-garde]] of the 1920s. Even in his more conventional films [[Luis Buñuel]] stuck to the spirit of outright [[revolt]] of L'Âge d'or. The bourgeoisie had to be expropriated and all its values destroyed, the surrealists believed. This spirit of revolt is also present in all films of [[Jean Vigo]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Remembrance and reflection==
Especially in the last decades of the twentieth century, many film makers considered focusing on remembrance of and reflection upon major collective crimes such as [[The Holocaust]], [[slavery]] and disasters such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]] to be their political and moral duty.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Globalization and related world issues==
Political cinema of the twenty-first century seems to focus on controversial topics such as [[globalization]], [[AIDS]] and other health-care concerns, issues pertaining to the [[natural environment|environment]], such as [[world energy resources and consumption]] and [[climate change]], and other complex matters pertaining to [[terrorism]], [[war]], [[peace]], [[Religious intolerance|religious and related forms of intolerance]], and [[civil and political rights]] and other [[human rights]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Griffith]]'s highly controversial film, which glorifies the [[Ku Klux Klan]], is widely considered to be a masterpiece because of its impact on the development of the cinema. The basic structure consists of a description of an idealized lost [[idyll]] ("the Old South"), the disruption of this order during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]] after the Civil War, and the restoration of [[White supremacy]], which is shown a legitimate goal that unites the former enemies. In the end the leader of the Ku Klux Klan secures his private happiness too and the alleged idyll is restored.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rationing]] was introduced temporarily by the British government several times during the 20th century, during and immediately after a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Ina | last=Zweiniger-Bargielowska | author-link=Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska|title=Austerity in Britain: Rationing, Controls and Consumption, 1939–1955 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=978-0-19-925102-5 | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kynaston"&gt;{{citation | first=David|last=Kynaston | authorlink=David Kynaston | year=2007 | publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] | title=Austerity Britain, 1945–1951 | isbn=978-0-7475-7985-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the [[Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, the United Kingdom was importing 20,000,000 long tons of food per year, including about 70% of its cheese and sugar, nearly 80% of fruits and about 70% of cereals and fats. The UK also imported more than half of its meat, and relied on imported feed to support its domestic meat production. The civilian population of the country was about 50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Ian | last=Macrory | title=Annual Abstract of Statistics|number=146|edition=2010 | publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] | url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ctu/annual-abstract-of-statistics/no-146--2010-edition/annual-abstract-of-statistics.pdf| year=2010 |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the principal strategies of the Germans in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] to attack shipping bound for Britain, restricting British industry and potentially starving the nation into submission.

To deal with sometimes extreme shortages, the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] instituted a system of [[rationing]]. To buy most rationed items, each person had to register at chosen shops, and was provided with a ration book containing coupons. The shopkeeper was provided with enough food for registered customers. Purchasers had to take ration books with them when shopping, so that the relevant coupon or coupons could be cancelled.

[[File:'Breaches of the Rationing Order' poster.jpg|thumb|A [[First World War]] government leaflet detailing the consequences of breaking the rationing laws.]]
In line with its [[Business as usual (policy)|business as usual]] policy during the [[First World War]], the government was initially reluctant to try to control the food markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Samuel J.|last=Hurwitz, |title=State Intervention in Great Britain: Study of Economic Control and Social Response, 1914–1919|isbn=978-1-136-93186-4|year=2013|pages=12–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It fought off attempts to introduce minimum prices in cereal production, though relenting in the area of control of essential imports (sugar, meat, and grains). When it did introduce changes, they were limited. In 1916, it became illegal to consume more than two courses while lunching in a public eating place or more than three for dinner; fines were introduced for members of the public found feeding the pigeons or stray animals.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Beckett, ''The Home Front 1914–1918: How Britain Survived the Great War'' (2006) p 381&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1917, Germany started [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] to try to starve Britain into submission. To meet this threat, voluntary rationing was introduced in February 1917. Bread was subsidised from September that year; prompted by local authorities taking matters into their own hands, compulsory rationing was introduced in stages between December 1917 and February 1918 as Britain's supply of wheat decreased to just six weeks' worth.&lt;ref&gt;John Morrow, ''The Great War: An Imperial History'' (2005)  p 202&lt;/ref&gt; To help the process, ration books were introduced in July 1918 for butter, margarine, lard, meat, and sugar.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Warwick Palmer and Veronica Palmer, '' The chronology of British history'' (1992) pp 355–356&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, rationing benefited the health of the country. During the war, average energy intake decreased by only 3%, but protein intake by 6%.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, ''The Home Front 1914–1918'' pp. 380–382&lt;/ref&gt;

== The general strike ==
The government made preparations to ration food in 1925, in advance of an expected [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike]], and appointed Food Control Officers for each region. In the event, the Trades Unions of the London docks organized blockades by crowds, but convoys of lorries under military escort took the heart out of the strike, so that the measures did not have to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William Keith |last=Hancock|first2=Margaret|last2=Gowing|title=British War Economy|edition=rev.|year=1975|series=History of the Second World War|volume=1|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|page=52|oclc=874487495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sample UK Childs Ration Book WW2.jpg|thumb|upright|Child's ration book, used during the Second World War.]]
After the Second World War began in September 1939 the first commodity to be controlled was petrol. On 8 January 1940 bacon, butter and sugar were rationed. This was followed by successive ration schemes for meat, tea, jam, biscuits, [[breakfast cereals]], cheese, eggs, lard, milk, and canned and dried fruit. In June 1942 the [[Combined Food Board]] was set up by Great Britain and the United States to coordinate the world supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. Almost all foods apart from vegetables and bread were rationed by August 1942. Strict rationing inevitably created a [[black market]]. Almost all controlled items were rationed by weight but meat was rationed by price.

Fresh vegetables and fruit were not rationed but supplies were limited. Some types of imported fruit all but disappeared. Lemons and bananas became unobtainable for most of the war; oranges continued to be sold but greengrocers customarily reserved them for children and pregnant women, who could prove their status by producing their distinctive ration books. Other domestically grown fruit such as apples still appeared from time to time, but again the sellers imposed their own restrictions so that customers were often not allowed to buy, for example, more than one apple each. Many people grew their own vegetables, greatly encouraged by the highly successful [[Victory garden|"Dig for Victory"]] [[motivational]] campaign. In 1942 numerous children between five and seven years old had become used to wartime restrictions. When questioned about bananas, many did not believe such items existed.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Geoffrey. Military Anecdotes (1992) pp. 19 &amp; 20. Guinness Publishing {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Game (food)|Game]] meat such as [[rabbit]] and [[Common Wood Pigeon|pigeon]] were not rationed but were not always available. A popular music-hall song, written 20 years previously but sung ironically, was "[[Yes!

Most controversial was bread; it was not rationed until after the war ended, but the "[[national loaf]]" of wholemeal bread replaced the ordinary white variety, to the distaste of most housewives who found it mushy, grey and easy to blame for digestion problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Angus|last=Calder|title=The people’s war: Britain 1939–45 |year=1992 |pages=276–77 |edition=New |publisher=Pimlico |isbn=978-0-7126-5284-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1942, an order was passed that meals served in hotels and restaurants must not cost over 5 shillings per customer, must not be of more than three courses, and at most one course could contain meat, fish or poultry. This was partly in response to increasing public concerns that "luxury" off-ration foodstuffs were being unfairly obtained by those who could afford to dine regularly in restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38329257 |work=Army News |place=Darwin, Australia |date=14 May 1942|title=British food control |publisher=[[Trove]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish was not rationed, but prices increased considerably as the war progressed. The government initially allowed this, since it realised that fishermen would need to be able to collect a premium for their catch if they were at risk of enemy attack while at sea, but prices were controlled from 1941.&lt;ref name="AgFish1946"&gt;{{cite book|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Fisheries in War Time: Report on the Sea Fisheries of England and Wales by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for the Years 1939–1944 Inclusive |publisher=H. M. Stationery Office|year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other non-rationed items, fish was rarely freely available, as supplies dropped to 30% of pre-war levels,&lt;ref name="AgFish1946"/&gt; and long queues built up at fishmongers and [[fish and chip shop]]s. The quality of wartime chips was often felt to be below standard, because of the low-quality fat available.

As the war progressed rationing was extended to other commodities such as [[clothing]]. Clothing was rationed on a points system. When it was introduced, on 1 June 1941, no clothing coupons had been issued, and at first the unused margarine coupons in ration books were valid for clothing. Initially the allowance was for about one new outfit per year; as the war progressed the points were reduced, until buying a coat used almost a year's clothing coupons. On 1 July 1942 the basic civilian petrol ration was abolished; this had been announced on 13 March 1942.&lt;ref name=suckingeggs/&gt; ([[Ivor Novello]] was a British public figure sent to prison for four weeks for misusing petrol coupons.) After that, vehicle fuel was only available to official users, such as the emergency services, bus companies and farmers. The priority users of fuel were always, of course, the armed forces. Fuel supplied to approved users was dyed, and use of this fuel for non-essential purposes was an offence.

Certain foodstuffs that the 1940s British consumer would find unusual, for example [[whale meat]] and canned [[Thyrsites atun|snoek]] fish from South Africa, were not rationed. Despite this they did not prove popular.&lt;ref name="kynaston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patten"&gt;{{cite book|first=Marguerite|last=Patten|authorlink=Marguerite Patten|publisher=[[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn]]|title=Feeding the Nation|year=2005|isbn=978-0-600-61472-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to rationing, the government equalized the food supply through subsidies on items consumed by the poor and the working class. In 1942–43, £145&amp;nbsp;million was spent on food subsidies, including £35&amp;nbsp;million on bread, flour and oatmeal, £23&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;million on meat and the same on potatoes, £11&amp;nbsp;million on milk, and £13&amp;nbsp;million on eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Keesing's Contemporary Archives''|volume=IV–V|date=June 1943|page=5,805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public catering ===

{{Main article|British Restaurant}}

[[File:Members of the public enjoying a meal in one of the chain of British Restaurants established during the Second World War, London, 1943. D12268.jpg|thumb|A [[British Restaurant]] in London, 1943]]
Restaurants were initially exempt from rationing but this was resented, as people with more money could supplement their food rations by eating out frequently. The Ministry of Food in May 1942 issued new restrictions on restaurants:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Keesing's Contemporary Archives|volume=IV|date=June 1942|page=5,224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Meals were limited to three courses; only one component dish could contain fish or game or poultry (but not more than one of these)
* In general no meals could be served between 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (midnight in London) and 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. without a special licence
* The maximum price of a meal was 5 shillings, with extra charges allowed for cabaret shows and luxury hotels.

About 2,000 new wartime establishments called [[British Restaurant]]s were run by local authorities in schools and church halls. Here a plain three-course meal cost only 9[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] and no ration coupons were required. They evolved from the [[London County Council]]'s ''Londoners' Meals Service'', which began as an emergency system for feeding people who had been blitzed out of their homes. They were open to all and mostly served office and industrial workers.{{sfn|Home Front Handbook|p=78}}&lt;ref name="hif"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources for the History of London 1939–45: Rationing|chapter=5.

{{see also|Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#UK_Population_change_over_time|label 1=UK population change}}

In December 1939 [[Elsie Widdowson]] and [[Robert McCance]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] tested whether the United Kingdom could survive with only domestic food production if U-boats ended all imports. Using 1938 food production data, they fed themselves and other volunteers one egg, one pound of meat and four ounces of fish a week; one quarter pint (0.14 litre) of milk a day; four ounces of margarine; and unlimited amounts of potatoes, vegetables and wholemeal bread. Two weeks of intensive outdoor exercise simulated the strenuous wartime physical work Britons would likely have to perform. The scientists found that the subjects' health and performance remained very good after three months; the only negative results were the increased time needed for meals to consume the necessary calories from bread and potatoes, and what they described as a "remarkable" increase in [[flatulence]] from the large amount of starch in the diet. The scientists also noted that their [[faeces]] had increased by 250% in volume.{{r|dawes20130924}}

The results—kept secret until after the war—gave the government confidence that, if necessary, food could be distributed equally to all, including high-value war workers, without causing widespread health problems. Britons' actual wartime diet was never as severe as in the Cambridge study because imports from the United States avoided the U-boats,&lt;ref name="dawes20130924"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/sep/24/fighting-fit-britain-second-world-war | title=Fighting fit: how dietitians tested if Britain would be starved into defeat | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=25 September 2013 | last=Dawes |first=Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rationing improved the health of British people; infant mortality declined and life expectancy rose, excluding deaths caused by hostilities. This was because it ensured that everyone had access to a varied diet with enough vitamins.&lt;ref name="hif"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/9728.php|title=Wartime Rationing helped the British get healthier than they had ever been|date=21 June 2004|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-food rations ===
====Clothing====
There were 66 points for clothing per year; in 1942 it was cut to 48, in 1943 to 36, and in 1945 to 24. In 1945, an overcoat (wool and fully lined) was 18 coupons; a man's suit, 26–29 (according to lining); men's shoes, 9; women's shoes, 7; woollen dresses, 11. Children aged 14–16 got 20 more coupons. Clothing rationing points could be used for wool, cotton and household textiles. People had extra points for work clothes, such as [[overall]]s for factory work.{{sfn|Home Front Handbook|pp=47–48}} No points were required for [[second-hand]] clothing or fur [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], but their prices were fixed. Before rationing [[lace]] and frills were popular on [[panties|knickers]] but these were soon banned so that material could be saved. From March to May 1942 [[utility clothing|clothing austerity measures]] were introduced which restricted the number of buttons, pockets and pleats (among other things) on clothes.&lt;ref name="Home Front Handbook48"&gt;{{harvnb|Home Front Handbook|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothes rationing ended on 15 March 1949.

====Soap====
All types of soap were rationed. Coupons were allotted by weight or (if liquid) by quantity. In 1945, the ration gave four coupons each month; babies and some workers and invalids were allowed more.&lt;ref name="Home Front Handbook48" /&gt; A coupon would yield:
* {{convert|4|oz|0|abbr=on}} bar [[hard soap]]
* {{convert|3|oz|0|abbr=on}} bar [[toilet soap]]
* {{convert|1/2|oz|0|abbr=on}} No. 1 [[liquid soap]]
* {{convert|6|oz|0|abbr=on}} soft soap
* {{convert|3|oz|0|abbr=on}} [[soap flakes]]
* {{convert|6|oz|0|abbr=on}} powdered soap

====Fuel====
The [[Fuel and Lighting (Coal) Order 1941]] came into force in January 1942. [[Central heating]] was prohibited "in the summer months".&lt;ref name="Home Front Handbook48" /&gt; Domestic coal was rationed to {{convert|15|long cwt|sigfig = 4}} for those in London and the south of England; {{convert|20|long cwt|sigfig = 4}} for the rest (the southern part of England having generally a milder climate).&lt;ref name="Home Front Handbook48"/&gt; Some kinds of coal such as [[anthracite]] were not rationed, and in the coal-mining areas were eagerly gathered as they were in the [[Great Depression]] (see ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'').

====Paper====
[[Newspapers]] were limited from September 1939, at first to 60% of their pre-war consumption of [[newsprint]]. [[Paper]] supply came under the No 48 Paper Control Order, 4 September 1942 and was controlled by the [[Ministry of Production]]. By 1945 newspapers were limited to 25% of their pre-war consumption. Wrapping paper for most goods was prohibited.{{sfn|Home Front Handbook|pp=50–51}}

The paper shortage often made it more difficult than usual for authors to get work published. In 1944, [[George Orwell]] wrote:

{{quote|
In Mr [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]]'s recent pamphlet ''Publishing in Peace and War'', some interesting facts are given about the quantities of paper allotted by the Government for various purposes. Here are the present figures:
{{aligned table|class=wikitable|style=margin-left:1em
|Newspapers | 250,000 tons
|[[H. M. Stationery Office]] | 100,000 tons
|Periodicals | (nearly) 50,000 tons
|Books | 22,000 tons
}}

A particularly interesting detail is that out of the 100,000 tons allotted to the Stationery Office, the War Office gets no less than 25,000 tons, or more than the whole of the book trade put together. ... At the same time paper for books is so short that even the most hackneyed "classic" is liable to be out of print, many schools are short of textbooks, new writers get no chance to start and even established writers have to expect a gap of a year or two years between finishing a book and seeing it published.

==== Other products ====
Whether rationed or not, many consumer goods became difficult to obtain because of the shortage of components. Examples included [[razor blade]]s, [[baby bottle]]s, alarm clocks, frying pans and pots. Balloons and sugar for cakes for birthday parties were partially or completely unavailable.

== Post-Second World War ==
On 8 May 1945, the Second World War ended in Europe, but rationing continued. Some aspects of rationing became stricter for some years after the war. At the time this was presented as needed to feed people in European areas under British control, whose economies had been devastated by the fighting.&lt;ref name="kynaston" /&gt; This was partly true, but with many British men still mobilised in the armed forces, an austere economic climate, and a centrally-planned economy under the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]], resources were not available to expand food production and food imports. Frequent strikes by some workers (most critically dock workers) made things worse.&lt;ref name="kynaston"/&gt; A common ration book fraud was the ration books of the dead being kept and used by the living.&lt;ref name=suckingeggs/&gt;

=== Political reaction ===
In the late 1940s the Conservative Party exploited and incited growing public anger at rationing, scarcity, controls, austerity and government bureaucracy.  They used the dissatisfaction with the socialistic and egalitarian policies of the Labour Party to rally middle-class supporters and build a political comeback that won the 1951 general election.  Their appeal was especially effective to housewives, who faced more difficult shopping conditions after the war than during it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ina Zweiniger-Bargileowska]], "Rationing, austerity and the Conservative party recovery after 1945", ''Historical Journal'' (1994) 37#1 pp. 173–97&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Timeline ===
* 27 May 1945: Bacon ration cut from 4 to 3 [[ounce]]s/week. Cooking fat ration cut from 2 to 1 ounces/week. Soap ration cut by an eighth, except for babies and young children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 23 May 1945, reprinted on page 34 of ''Daily Telegraph'' Saturday 23 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The referenced newspaper article predicted that households would be grossly hampered in making food items that included [[pastry]].
* 1 June 1945: The basic petrol ration for civilians was restored.&lt;ref name=suckingeggs/&gt;
* 19 July 1945: In order to preserve the egalitarian nature of rationing, gift food parcels from overseas weighing more than {{convert|5|lb|abbr=on}} would be deducted from the recipient's ration.
* Summer 1946: Continual rain ruined Britain's wheat crop. Bread rationing started.
* January–March 1947: [[Winter of 1946–1947 in the United Kingdom]]: long hard frost and deep snow. Frost destroyed a huge amount of stored potatoes. Potato rationing started.
* Mid-1947: A transport and dock strike, which among other effects caused much loss of imported meat left to rot on the docks, until the Army broke the strike. The basic petrol ration was stopped.&lt;ref name=suckingeggs/&gt;
* 1 June 1948: The [[Motor Spirit (Regulation) Act 1948]] was passed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/policejl22&amp;div=33&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=22 Police Journal 1949 Motor Spirit (Regulation) Act, 1948, The|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuel dyes#United Kingdom|ordering a red dye to be to put into some petrol]], and that red petrol was only allowed to be used in [[commercial vehicle]]s. A private car driver could lose his driving licence for a year if red petrol was found in his car. A petrol station could be shut down if it sold red petrol to a private car driver. See [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1940–1959#1948|List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1940–1959: 1948]].
* June 1948: The basic petrol ration was restored, at a third of its previous size.
* 1948: Bread came off ration.
* May 1949: Clothes rationing ended. According to one author,&lt;ref name="suckingeggs"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sucking Eggs|first=Patricia|last=Nicol|publisher=Vintage Books|place=London|year=2010|isbn=9780099521129}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was because attempts to enforce it were defeated by continual massive illegality ([[black market]], unofficial trade in loose clothing coupons (many forged), bulk thefts of unissued clothes ration books).
* 23 February 1950: The [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]] is fought largely on the issue of rationing. The Conservative Party campaigned on a [[manifesto]] of ending rationing as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name="kynaston"/&gt; The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] argued for the continuation of rationing indefinitely. Labour was returned, but with its majority badly slashed to 5 seats.
* 26 May 1950: Petrol rationing ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/26/newsid_2502000/2502691.stm|title=1950: UK drivers cheer end of fuel rations|accessdate=27 March 2009|date=26 May 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 25 October 1951: [[United Kingdom general election, 1951]]. The Conservatives came back into power.
* February 1953: Confectionery rationing ended.
* September 1953: Sugar rationing ended.
* 4 July 1954: Meat and all other food rationing ended in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_3818000/3818563.stm|title=1954: Housewives celebrate end of rationing|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=BBC|accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although rationing formally ended in 1954, cheese production remained depressed for decades afterwards. During rationing, most milk in Britain was used to make one kind of cheese, nicknamed Government Cheddar (not to be confused with the [[government cheese]] issued by the US welfare system).&lt;ref name=CooksInfo&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/government-cheddar-cheese |title=Government Cheddar Cheese |work=CooksInfo.com |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wiped out nearly all other cheese production in the country, and some indigenous varieties of cheese almost disappeared.&lt;ref name=CooksInfo/&gt; Later government controls on milk prices through the [[Milk Marketing Board]] continued to discourage production of other varieties of cheese until well into the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://www.thestar.com/News/article/264784 | title= Cool Britannia rules the whey  |last=Potter |first=Mich | publisher= [[Toronto Star]]  | date= 9 October 2007 | accessdate= 13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was only in the mid-1990s (following the effective abolition of the MMB) that the revival of the British cheese industry began in earnest.

== Suez Crisis ==
Petrol rationing was briefly reintroduced in late 1956 during the [[Suez Crisis]] but ended again on 14 May 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/14/newsid_2511000/2511733.stm|title=1957: Cheers as petrol rationing ended|accessdate=2009-03-27 | date=14 May 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising of petrol on the recently introduced [[ITV Network|ITV]] was banned for a period.

== 1970s oil crises ==
Petrol coupons were issued for a short time as preparation for the possibility of petrol rationing during the [[Oil crisis of 1973|1973 oil crisis]]. The rationing never came about, in large part because increasing [[North Sea oil]] production allowed the UK to offset much of the lost imports. By the time of the [[1979 energy crisis]], the United Kingdom had become a [[Oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom|net exporter of oil]], so on that occasion the government did not even have to consider petrol rationing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3935">The '''Regency Act 1705''' (4 Ann. c.8) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of England]].

The Act was passed at a time when Parliament was anxious to ensure that a [[Protestant]] [[Succession to the British throne|succeeded to the throne]] on the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. The Act was conceived by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[Whig Junto|Junto]], mainly by [[John Somers, Baron Somers|John Somers]], and seen through the House of Lords by [[Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton|Lord Wharton]]. [[William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper|Lord Cowper]] later claimed the Act was designed "to put it [the succession] in such a method as was not to be resisted but by open force of arms and a public declaration for the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Pretender]]".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Holmes, ''British Politics in the Age of Anne. Revised  Edition'' (London: The Hambledon  Press, 1987), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act required [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy counsellors]] and other officers, in the event of Anne's death, to [[Accession Council|proclaim]] as her successor the next Protestant in the line of succession to the throne, and made it [[high treason]] to fail to do so. If the next Protestant successor was abroad at the death of Anne, seven great Officers of State named in the Act (and others whom the heir-apparent thought fit to appoint), called "Lords Justices," would form a regency. The heir-apparent would name these others through a secret instrument which would be sent to England in three copies and delivered to the Hanoverian Resident, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Michael, ''England Under  George I. The Beginnings of  the Hanoverian Dynasty'' (London:  Macmillan, 1936), pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lords Justices were to have the power to give [[Royal Assent|royal assent]] to bills, except that they would be guilty of treason if they amended the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]].

The Act also made it treason to say in writing than Anne was not the lawful queen, or that [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James the Pretender]] had any right to inherit the Crown. It was [[praemunire]] to say so in speech. The Act also confirmed the clauses in the [[Parliament Act 1695]] which stipulated that Parliament would continue to sit should the Sovereign die "for and during the term of six months and no longer, unless the same be sooner prorogued or dissolved by such person to whom the Crown of this realm of Great Britain shall come".&lt;ref&gt;Michael, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act received [[Royal Assent]] in March 1706,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; but came into force retrospectively from the beginning of that session of Parliament (hence it is dated 1705).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] at the end of the session of Parliament was sent to Hanover to present a copy of the Act to the heir apparent, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was replaced only two years later by the [[Succession to the Crown Act 1707]].

The '''Russian apartment bombings''' were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the [[Russia|Russian]] cities of [[Buynaksk]], [[Moscow]] and [[Volgodonsk]] between 4 and 16 September 1999, killing 293 people and injuring more than 1,000, spreading a wave of fear across the country. To date, no one has taken credit for the bombings; the Russian government blamed Chechen militants, although they, along with Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]], denied responsibility. The bombings, together with the [[Dagestan War]], led the country into the [[Second Chechen War]]. Then-Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]]'s handling of the crisis boosted his popularity and helped him attain the presidency within a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffman|2002|pp=461–477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strobeTalbott"&gt;{{Harvnb|Talbott|2002|pp=356–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September, an explosive device similar to those used in the bombings was found and defused in an apartment block in the Russian city of [[Ryazan]].&lt;ref name=lentaprosecutors&gt;[http://vip.lenta.ru/doc/2002/05/14/prosecutors/ Ответ Генпрокуратуры на депутатский запрос о взрывах в Москве] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210221753/http://vip.lenta.ru/doc/2002/05/14/prosecutors/ |date=10 February 2012 }} {{ru icon}}, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://vip.lenta.ru/doc/2002/05/14/prosecutors/ machine translation].&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan and ordered the air bombing of [[Grozny]], marking the beginning of the Second Chechen War.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldfarb|Litvinenko|2007|pp=190, 196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-six hours later, local police arrested the perpetrators, who were discovered to in fact be three [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] agents. The Russian government declared that the incident had simply been a training exercise, and the agents were released on Moscow’s orders.&lt;ref name="AmyKnight" /&gt; 

Parliament member [[Yuri Shchekochikhin]] filed two motions for a parliamentary investigation, but the motions were rejected by the Russian [[Duma]] in March 2000. An independent public commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma deputy [[Sergei Kovalev]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur46/012/2006/en/?open&amp;of=ENG-2EU&lt;/ref&gt; but the commission was rendered ineffective due to the Russian government's refusal to respond to its inquiries. The official Russian investigation of the bombings was completed in 2002 and concluded that all the bombings were organised and led by [[Achemez Gochiyayev]], who remains at large, and ordered by Islamist warlords [[Ibn Al-Khattab]] and [[Abu Omar al-Saif]], who have been killed. Five other suspects have been killed and six have been convicted by Russian courts on terrorism-related charges.

A number of historians and observers have stated that the bombings were a [[false flag]] attempt, coordinated by Russian state security services to bring Putin into the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Explosives in Ryazan controversy ====
The position of Russian authorities on the Ryazan incident changed significantly over time. Initially, it was declared by the FSB and federal government to be a real threat. However, after the people who planted the bomb were identified as [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] operatives, the official version changed to “security training”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSB also initially reported that the explosives used by the terrorists was [[RDX]] (or “hexogen”). However, it declared later that the explosive was not RDX, but a mixture of aluminium powder, [[nitre]] (saltpeter), sugar and [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] prepared by the perpetrators in a [[concrete mixer]] at a fertiliser factory in [[Urus-Martan]], Chechnya.&lt;ref name="Kommersant2004-01-13"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?docsid=440000 Two life sentences for 246 murders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029101115/http://kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=440000 |date=29 October 2010 }}, ''Kommersant'', 13 January 2004.

Yuri Tkachenko, the police explosives expert who defused the Ryazan bomb, insisted that it was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.&lt;ref name="Satter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shadow"/&gt; However, later at a press conference on the occasion of the Federal Security Service Employee Day in December 2001, Tkachenko denounced his previous conclusions and said  the detonator was a hunting cartridge that it would not be able to detonate any known explosives.&lt;ref name="fsb-satisfied"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&amp;m=8.htm Today is the Federal Security Service Employee Day: Satisfied with the year summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |date=31 January 2011 }}, Ryazanskie Vedomosti, 20 December 2001, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244%26m=8.htm computer translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, the Russian newspaper ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' reported the account of Private Alexei Pinyayev of the 137th Regiment, who guarded a military facility near the city of Ryazan. He was surprised to see that “a storehouse with weapons and ammunition” contained sacks with the word “sugar” on them. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and made tea with the sugar taken from the bag. But the taste of the tea was terrible. They became suspicious since people were talking about the explosions. The substance turned out to be [[hexogen]]. After the newspaper report, FSB officers “descended on Pinyayev’s unit”, accused them of “divulging a state secret” and told them, “You guys can't even imagine what serious business you’ve got yourselves tangled up in.” The regiment later sued publishers of ''Novaya Gazeta'' for insulting the honour of the Russian Army, since there was no Private Alexei Pinyayev in the regiment, according to their statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Felshtinsky|Pribylovsky|2008|pp=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] press conference, Private Pinyayev stated that there was no hexogen in the 137th Airborne Regiment and that he was hospitalised in December 1999 and no longer visited the range.&lt;ref name="fsb-satisfied" /&gt;

According to Satter, all four bombings that occurred had a similar “signature” which indicated that the explosives had been carefully prepared, a mark of skilled specialists. There is also no explanation as to how the terrorists were able to obtain tons of hexogen explosive and transport it to various locations in Russia; hexogen is produced in one plant in [[Perm Oblast]] for which the central FSB is responsible for the security. The culprits would also have needed to organise nine explosions (the four that occurred and the five attempted bombings reported by the authorities) in different cities in a two-week period. Satter's estimate for the time required for target plan development, site visits, explosives preparation, renting space at the sites and transporting explosives to the sites was four to four and a half months.&lt;ref name="Satter" /&gt;

=== Advanced warnings about the impending bombings ===
In July 1999, Russian journalist Aleksandr Zhilin, writing in the [[Moskovskaya pravda]], warned that there would be terrorist attacks in Moscow organised by the government. Using a leaked Kremlin document as evidence, he added that the motive would be to undermine the opponents of the Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]]. These included Moscow mayor [[Yury Luzhkov]] and former prime minister [[Yevgeny Primakov]]. However, this warning was ignored.&lt;ref name="AmyKnight"&gt;{{cite web

His source was an officer of the Russian military intelligence ([[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]]).

After everything was planned, the participants were organised into several groups which then transported the explosives to different cities.

The explosion in Moscow mall on 31 August was committed by another man, Magomed-Zagir Garzhikaev on the orders from [[Shamil Basayev]], according to the FSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Court rulings ====
According to the court ruling, Al-Khattab paid Gochiyayev $500,000 to carry out the attacks at Guryanova Street, [[Kashirskoye Highway]], and Borisovskiye Prudy, and then helped to hide Gochiyayev and his accomplices in Chechnya.&lt;ref name="wolvesofislam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_fsbpic" /&gt; In early September 1999, Magayayev, Krymshamkhalov, Batchayev and Dekkushev reloaded the cargo into a [[Mercedes-Benz 2236]]&lt;ref name=prigovor&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; trailer and delivered it to Moscow. En route, they were protected from possible complications by an accomplice, Khakim Abayev,&lt;ref name=prigovor /&gt; who accompanied the trailer in another car. In Moscow they were met by [[Achemez Gochiyayev]], who registered in [[Hotel Altai]] under the fake name "Laipanov", and Denis Saitakov. The explosives were left in a [[warehouse]] in Ulitsa Krasnodonskaya, which was leased by pseudo-Laipanov (Gochiyayev.) The next day, the explosives were delivered in "[[ZIL-5301]]" vans to three addresses&amp;nbsp;– Ulitsa Guryanova, Kashirskoye Shosse and Ulitsa Borisovskiye Prudy, where pseudo-Laipanov leased cellars.&lt;ref name=prigovor /&gt; Gochiyayev supervised the placement of the bombs in the rented cellars. Next followed the explosions at the former two addresses. The explosion at 16 Borisovskiye Prudy was prevented.&lt;ref name="wolvesofislam" /&gt;

According to the court, 14 September [[Buinaksk]] bombings were ordered by Al-Khattab, who promised the bombers $300,000 to drive their truck bombs into the centre of the compound, which would have destroyed four apartment buildings simultaneously. However, the bombers parked on an adjacent street instead and blew up only one building. At the trial they complained that Khattab had not given them all the money he owed them.&lt;ref name="wolvesofislam" /&gt; One of the bombers confessed working for Al-Khattab, but claimed he did not know the explosives were intended to blow up the military apartment buildings.&lt;ref name="wolvesofislam" /&gt;

The explosion in the mall on Manezhnaya Square was the subject of a separate court process held in Moscow in 2009. The court accused Khalid Khuguyev {{lang-ru|link=no|Халид Хугуев}} and Magumadzir Gadzhikayev {{lang-ru|link=no|Магумадзаир Гаджиакаев}} in organisation and execution of the 1999 explosions in the Manezhnaya Square mall and in hotel [[Intourist]] and sentenced them correspndingly to 25 years and 15 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He then was asked by [[Vladimir Alexeyevich Kara-Murza|Vladimir Kara-Murza]] if he believes that several key members of his commission, and even [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovskiy]] and [[Boris Nemtsov]] who "knew quite a few things about the bombings" were killed to prevent the independent investigation. Kovalev responded: "I cannot state with full confidence that the explosions were organized by the authorities. Although it's clear that the explosions were useful for them, useful for future President [[Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin]], because he had just promised to "waste in the outhouse" (as he said) everyone who had any relation to terrorism. It was politically beneficial for him to scare people with terrorism. That is not proven. But what can be stated with full confidence is this: the investigation of both the Moscow explosions and the so-called "exercises" in Ryazan is trumped up. There can be various possibilities. It seems to me, that Ryazan should have been the next explosion, but I cannot prove that."

== Theory of Russian government involvement ==
According to [[David Satter]], [[Yuri Felshtinsky]], [[Alexander Litvinenko]], [[Vladimir Pribylovsky]] and [[Boris Kagarlitsky]], the bombings were a successful ''[[coup d'état]]'' coordinated by the Russian state security services to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya and to bring Putin to power.&lt;ref name="Kagarlitsky"&gt;{{cite web

The war in Chechnya boosted Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin's popularity, and brought the pro-war [[Unity (political party, Russia)|Unity Party]] to the [[State Duma]] and Putin to the presidency within a few months.

David Satter stated, during his testimony in the [[United States House of Representatives]], that "With Yeltsin and his family facing possible criminal prosecution, however, a plan was put into motion to put in place a successor who would guarantee that Yeltsin and his family would be safe from prosecution and the criminal division of property in the country would not be subject to reexamination. For "Operation Successor" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early. Putin was elected president and his first act was to guarantee Yeltsin immunity from prosecution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/SatterHouseTestimony2007.pdf Satter House Testimony] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065706/http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/SatterHouseTestimony2007.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The bombings in Buynaksk were carried out by a team of twelve [[GRU]] officers who were sent to Dagestan and supervised by the head of GRU's 14th Directorate General Kostechenko. That version was partly based on a testimony by [[Aleksey Galkin]]. The bombing in Buynaksk was conducted by the GRU to avoid an "interagency conflict between the FSB and the Ministry of Defense"
* In Moscow, Volgodonsk and Ryazan, the attacks were organized by the FSB through a chain of command that included director of the counter-terrorism department General [[German Ugryumov]], FSB operatives [[Maxim Lazovsky]], Vladimir Romanovich, Ramazan Dyshekov and others.  [[Achemez Gochiyayev]], Tatyana Korolyeva, and Alexander Karmishin rented warehouses that received shipments of hexogen disguised as sugar and possibly did not know that the explosives were delivered.
* Adam Dekkushev, Krymshamkhalov, and Timur Batchayev were recruited by FSB agents who presented themselves as "Chechen separatists" to deliver explosives to Volgodonsk and Moscow.
* Names and the fate of FSB agents who planted the bomb in the city of Ryazan remain unknown.

In 2008, British journalist [[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] concluded in his book ''The New Cold War: Putin's Russia and the Threat to the West'' that "The weight of evidence so far supports the grimmest interpretation: that the attacks were a ruthlessly planned stunt to create a climate of panic and fear in which Putin would quickly become the country's indisputable leader, as indeed he did."&lt;ref name="Lucas" /&gt;

In her book [[Putin's Kleptocracy]], historian [[Karen Dawisha]] had summarized various evidence related to the bombings and concluded: "That the political group around Putin could have masterminded the apartment bombings is horrifying. It is virtually impossible to find such examples in modern history. Certainly many leaders have started wars abroad and killed «others» in their own quest for political power at home. Leaders like Hafez Assad in Syria and Saddam Hussein in Iraq brutally killed many of their citizens who dared to challenge their rule. But to blow up your own innocent and sleeping people in your capital city is an action almost unthinkable. Yet the evidence that the FSB was at least involved in planting a bomb in Ryazan is incontrovertible."&lt;ref&gt;''Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia?'', By Karen Dawisha, 2014, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], page 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Russian journalist [[Andrei Soldatov]], "From the start, it seemed that the Kremlin was determined to suppress all discussion ... When Alexander Podrabinek, a Russian human rights activist, tried to import copies of Litvinenko's and Felshtinsky's ''Blowing up Russia'' in 2003, they were confiscated by the FSB. Trepashkin himself, acting as a lawyer for two relatives of the victims of the blast, was unable to obtain information he requested and was entitled to see by law".

Russian journalist and radio host [[Yulia Latynina]] opined that the version about FSB involvement was absurd because it was promoted by [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] who himself brought Putin to power.&lt;ref name="Latynina_ECHO"&gt;[http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/code/621021-echo/ Access code] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127020134/http://echo.msk.ru/programs/code/621021-echo/ |date=27 November 2009 }} (Yulia Latynina's radio program), September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, she criticized the FSB for poor handling the case.&lt;ref name="Latynina_EJ"&gt;{{ru-icon}} {{cite news

According to [[Strobe Talbott]] who was a [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]] during the events, "there was no evidence to support" the "conspiracy theory, although Russian public opinion did indeed solidify behind Putin in his determination to carry out a swift, decisive counteroffensive."&lt;ref name="strobeTalbott" /&gt;

=== Other ===
Russian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted: "The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against."&lt;ref name="Nedbaeva" /&gt;

== Sealing information by the US government ==
On 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. She responded that, no, “we have not seen evidence that ties the bombings to Chechnya.” &lt;ref name="sealing" /&gt;

On 14 July 2016, [[David Satter]] filed a request to obtain official assessment of who was responsible for the bombings from the State Department, the CIA and the FBI under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. He received response that all documents were [[Classified information|classified by US government]] because "that information had the potential ... to cause serious damage to the relationship with the Russian government". [[CIA]] refused even to acknowledge the existence of any relevant records because doing so would reveal "very specific aspects of the Agency's intelligence interest, or lack thereof, in the Russian bombings."&lt;ref name="sealing" /&gt;

According to a cable on the Ryazan incident from the U.S. embassy in Moscow, on 24 March 2000, "a former Russian intelligence officer, apparently one of the embassy's principal informants, said that the real story about the Ryazan incident could never be known because it "would destroy the country." The informant said the FSB had "a specially trained team of men" whose mission was "to carry out this type of urban warfare"&lt;ref name=Cardin /&gt; and [[Viktor Cherkesov]], the FSB’s first deputy director and an interrogator of Soviet dissidents was "exactly the right person to order and carry out such actions.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/242820/america-helped-make-putin-dictator-for-life How America Helped Make Vladimir Putin Dictator for Life] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918021115/http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/242820/america-helped-make-putin-dictator-for-life |date=18 September 2017 }} by [[David Satter]], 29 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2018, Senator [[Ben Cardin]] of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] released, "Putin's Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for U.S. National Security."&lt;ref name=Cardin&gt;{{Cite web

== Books and films ==
The theory of Russian government involvement appears in books and movies on the subject.

=== Documentaries ===
[[David Satter]], a senior fellow of the [[Hudson Institute]], authored two books ''Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State'' and ''The Less You Know, The Better You Sleep: Russia's Road to Terror and Dictatorship under Yeltsin and Putin'' (published by [[Yale University Press]] in 2003 and 2016) where he scrutinized the events and came to the conclusion that the bombings were organized by Russian state security services.{{harv|Satter|2003}}&lt;ref name="shadow" /&gt;

In 2002, former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko and historian [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] published a book ''[[Blowing up Russia: Terror from within]]''.{{harv|Felshtinsky|Litvinenko|2007}} According to authors the bombings and other terrorist acts have been committed by Russian security services to justify the [[Second Chechen War]] and to bring Vladimir Putin to power.&lt;ref name="seizure"&gt;[http://eng.terror99.ru/publications/133.htm Russian editor questioned over seizure of controversial book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207044901/http://eng.terror99.ru/publications/133.htm |date=7 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another book, ''[[Lubyanka Criminal Group]]'', Litvinenko and [[Alexander Goldfarb (microbiologist)|Alexander Goldfarb]] described the transformation of the FSB into a criminal and terrorist organization, including conducting the bombings. {{harv|Litvinenko|2002}} Former [[GRU]] analyst and historian [[Viktor Suvorov]] said that the book describes "a leading criminal group that provides "protection" for all other [[organized crime]] in the country and which continues the criminal war against their own people", like their predecessors [[NKVD]] and KGB. He added: "The book proves: [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka]] [the KGB headquarters] was taken over by [[Enemy of the people#Soviet Union|enemies of the people]]... If Putin's team can not disprove the facts provided by Litvinenko, Putin must shoot himself. Patrushev and all other leadership of ''Lubyanka Criminal Group'' must follow his example."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Goldfarb (biologist)|Alexander Goldfarb]] and [[Marina Litvinenko]] published a book ''[[Death of a Dissident]]''.{{harv|Goldfarb|Litvinenko|2007}} They asserted that the [[Alexander Litvinenko poisoning|murder of Mr. Litvinenko]] was "the most compelling proof" of the FSB involvement theory.  According to the book, the murder of Litvinenko "gave credence to all his previous theories, delivering justice for the tenants of the bombed apartment blocks, the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis|Moscow theater-goers]], Sergei Yushenkov, Yuri Shchekochikhin, and [[Anna Politkovskaya]], and the half-exterminated [[Chechen people|nation of Chechnya]], exposing their killers for the whole world to see."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldfarb|Litvinenko|2007|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film [[Assassination of Russia]] was made in 2000 by two French producers who had previously worked on [[NTV Russia|NTV]]'s ''Sugar of Ryazan'' program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.event_summary&amp;event_id=12242 "Assassination of Russia"- Film Screening and Panel Discussion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026054141/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.event_summary&amp;event_id=12242 |date=26 October 2008 }}, [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], 24 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldfarb|Litvinenko|2007|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergei Markov]], an advisor to the Russian government, criticised the film as "propaganda"&lt;ref name="wilsoncentre"&gt;{{cite web

A documentary ''Nedoverie'' ("Disbelief") about the bombing controversy made by Russian director [[Andrei Nekrasov]] was premiered at the 2004 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film chronicles the story of Tatyana and Alyona Morozova, the two Russian-American sisters, who had lost their mother in the attack, and decided to find out who did it.&lt;ref name="TheMoscowTimes"&gt;[http://context.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2004/09/03/101.html Screening Horror; A new film seeks the truth behind the 1999 bombings.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218064822/http://context.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2004/09/03/101.html |date=18 February 2007 }}, ''The Moscow Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDb"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389929/ Disbelief] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208002507/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389929/ |date=8 February 2017 }}.

=== Fiction ===
Writer [[Alexander Prokhanov]] authored a political thriller ''Mr. Hexogen'' which describes the bombings as a "[[chekism|chekist]] electoral technique".&lt;ref&gt;''The Age of Assassins'', page 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.newsmax.com 2007"&gt;{{cite web

Yuli Dubov, author of [[Tycoon (2002 film)|''The Big Slice'']], wrote a novel ''The Lesser Evil'', based on the bombings. The main characters of the story are ''Platon'' ([[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]) and ''Larry'' ([[Badri Patarkatsishvili]]). They struggle against an evil KGB officer, ''Old man'' (apparently inspired by the legendary [[Philipp Bobkov]]), who brings another KGB officer, ''Fedor Fedorovich'' (Vladimir Putin) to power by staging a series of apartment bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.svoboda.org/ll/polit/0205/ll.021905-1.asp Новый роман Юлия Дубова о приходе к власти Владимира Путина] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221100833/http://svoboda.org/ll/polit/0205/ll.021905-1.asp |date=21 February 2005 }}, [[RFE/RL]], 19-02-05&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sodium tartrate''' (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is used as an [[emulsion|emulsifier]] and a binding agent in food products such as [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jellies]], [[margarine]], and [[sausage]] casings.  As a [[food additive]], it is known by the [[E number]] E335.

Because its [[crystal structure]] captures a very precise amount of [[water]], it is also a common primary standard for [[Karl Fischer titration]], a common technique to assay water content.

The vice president only constitutional power is the immediate successor to the president of Sierra Leone if the president resigned or is removed from office by the Sierra Leone parliament]. Other than that the power of the vice president depends on the role delegated to the office by the president.

The current Vice President of Sierra Leone is [[Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh]], a member of the ruling [[Sierra Leone People's Party]]; he was sworn in as vice president on April 4, 2018, after the victory of Jalloh's and [[Julius Maada Bio]]'s presidential [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] in the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 2018|2018 Sierra Leone presidential election]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22264">A '''whip''' is an official of a [[political party]] whose task is to ensure [[party discipline]] in a [[legislature]]. Whips are the party's "enforcers"; they invite their fellow legislators to attend voting sessions and to vote according to the official party policy.  The term is taken from the "whipper-in" during a hunt, who tries to prevent the hounds from wandering away from the pack.

Additionally, the term "whip" may mean the voting instructions issued to members by the whip&lt;ref&gt;Pandiyan, M. Veera (May 14, 2006). [http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/05/how-term-whip-came-to-be-used-in.htm How the term 'Whip' came to be used in Parliament]. ''[[The Star (Malaysia)]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;, or the status of a certain legislator in their party's parliamentary grouping.

==Etymology==
The expression ''whip'' in its parliamentary context has its origins in hunting terminology.   The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' defines the term ''whipper-in'' as, "a huntsman's assistant who keeps the hounds from straying by driving them back with the whip into the main body of the pack". According to that dictionary, the first recorded use of the term ''whipper-in'' in the parliamentary sense occurs in 1772.  However, P. D. G. Thomas in ''House of Commons in the Eighteenth Century'' cites two examples of the use of the term that pre-date 1772.&lt;ref name="SN02829"&gt;House of Commons briefing note: The Whip's Office Doc ref. SN/PC/02829. Last updated 10th October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was within the context of such summonses to members out of town that the first known Parliamentary instance of the use of the term "whip" occurred. In the debate of 8 May 1769 on a petition from some Middlesex freeholders against the seating of Henry Luttrell instead of John Wilkes, Edmund Burke mentioned that the ministry had sent for their friends to the north and to Paris, "whipping them in, than which, he said, there could not be a better phrase". Although Burke's particular emphasis on the expression implied its comparative novelty, the hunting term had been used in this political context for at least a generation: on 18 November 1742 Heneage Finch remarked in a letter to Lord Malton that "the Whigs for once in their lives have whipped in better than the Tories".}}

== Australia ==
{{main|Party whip (Australia)}}
In the [[Parliament of Australia]], as well as in the parliaments of the six states and two self-governing territories, major political parties have whips to ensure party discipline and carry out a variety of other functions on behalf of the party leadership. The most important function of the whip's office is to ensure that all members and senators are present to take part in votes in the chamber (maintaining [[quorum]] and preventing [[censure motion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Education Office. [http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fss/fss26.html Fact Sheet 36: The Party Whip].&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in the [[United Kingdom]], Australian whips do not hold official office, but they are recognised for parliamentary purposes. In practice, Australian whips play a lesser role than their counterparts in the United Kingdom, as [[party discipline]] in Australia tends to be tighter.&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library. [http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0203/03CIB01 Free Votes in Australian and some Overseas Parliaments].&lt;/ref&gt;

Their roles in the chamber include taking divisions, and maintaining a "[[Pair (parliamentary convention)|pairs book]]" which controls the ability of members and senators to leave the parliament building during sittings, as well as the entitlement to be absent during divisions.

[[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] whips are appointed by the leader of the party, while [[Australian Labor Party]] whips are elected by the [[Australian Labor Party Caucus|Caucus]]. For Labor and the Liberals, the chief whip is assisted by two deputy whips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Parliamentary Education Office |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/party_whip.html |title=Fact Sheet – Party Whips |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
{{Main|Party Whip (Canada)}}
In [[Canada]] the Party Whip is the member of a political party in the Canadian House of Commons, the Canadian Senate or a provincial legislature charged with ensuring party discipline among members of the [[caucus]]. The whip is also responsible for assigning offices and scheduling speakers from his or her party for various bills, motions and other proceedings in the House.

== India ==
In [[Politics of India|India]], the concept of the whip was inherited from [[British Rule in India|colonial British rule]]. Every major political party appoints a whip who is responsible for the party's discipline and behaviours on the floor of the [[Parliament of India|house]]. Usually, he/she directs the party members to stick to the party's stand on certain issues and directs them to vote as per the direction of senior party members.&lt;ref name="Derek O'Brien is TMC's Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha"&gt;{{cite news|title=Derek O'Brien is TMC's Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=770815|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=Outlook India|date=Aug 2, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014225153/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=770815|archivedate=14 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leaders and chief whip act"&gt;{{cite web|title=leaders and chief whips of recognised parties and groups in parliament (facilities) act, 1998|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/msa_section/leader_chief1998.pdf|publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=3 August 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69dRYMQuE?url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/msa_section/leader_chief1998.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some cases such as [[Presidential election in india|Indian Presidential elections]] where whips cannot direct a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) or [[Member of Legislative Assembly]] (MLA) on whom to vote.&lt;ref name="Issuing whips to MPs, MLAs in Presidential poll is an offence: EC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Issuing whips to MPs, MLAs in Presidential poll is an offence: EC|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Issuing-whips-to-MPs-MLAs-in-Presidential-poll-is-an-offence-EC/articleshow/14809952.cms |accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=Jul 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ireland ==
Whips exist for all parliamentary parties in [[Dáil Éireann]] and [[Seanad Éireann]].&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/education/glossary/#W|title=Whips|work=Glossary|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=21 February 2012|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[government of Ireland|government]] chief whip is normally a [[Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach]],&lt;ref name="MacCarthaigh2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacCarthaigh|first=Muiris|title=Government in Modern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q80bAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 February 2012|date=2008|publisher=Institute of Public Administration|isbn=978-1-904541-72-1|page=37, fn.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attends [[cabinet meeting]]s.&lt;ref name="MacCarthaigh"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacCarthaigh|first=Muiris|title=Accountability in Irish parliamentary politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GloNPkwnR2AC&amp;pg=PA147 |chapter=How parliamentary accountability functions in Ireland |accessdate=21 February 2012|year=2005|publisher=Institute of Public Administration|isbn=978-1-904541-31-8|pages=147–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whips of each house meet weekly to set the agenda for the next week's business.&lt;ref name="MacCarthaigh"/&gt; The [[Technical Group]] in the Dáil and the analogous Independent groups in the Seanad nominate whips to attend these meetings even though there is no party line for their whips to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2011/06/02/00006.asp#N114|title=Dáil Reform: Statements|last=Murphy|first=Catherine|date=2 June 2011|work=Dáil debates|publisher=Oireachtas|nopp=Y |page=Vol. 734 No.2 p.6 c.250|quote=I act as the whip for the Technical Group even though there is no party line to be enforced.|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whips also coordinate [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|pairing]].&lt;ref name="glossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacCarthaigh"/&gt;

The timing of most votes are difficult to predict and TDs are expected to stay within earshot of the division bell at all times. All TDs are required to vote with their party and to receive permission if they intend to be absent for a vote. [[Free votes]] are not a common feature of the Irish parliamentary tradition but they do happen on occasion, and there are calls for them to happen more often.  For instance, Fianna Fail usually allows a free vote on abortion bills as in the Protection of Human Life In Pregnancy Act &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ronan McGreevy|title=Fianna Fáil to allow free vote on forthcoming abortion legislation|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/fianna-fáil-to-allow-free-vote-on-forthcoming-abortion-legislation-1.1411977|website=The Irish Times|date=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 1998, whips and assistant whips may be entitled to an allowance on top of their base legislator's salary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0005/sec0003.html Oireachtas (Allowances To Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Act, 1998] [[Irish Statute Book]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, these allowances varied proportional to the size of the group, with [[Fianna Fáil]]'s Dáil whip's allowance the highest at €19,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/si/0347.html S.I. No. 347/2011 — Oireachtas (Allowances) (Members and Holders of Parliamentary and Certain Ministerial Offices) Order 2011] Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malaysia ==
{{Main|Party whip (Malaysia)}}

== New Zealand ==
{{See also|Senior Whip of the Labour Party|Senior Whip of the Liberal Party|Senior Whip of the National Party}}
In New Zealand, the concept of the whip was inherited from British rule. All political parties that have four or more members in Parliament have at least one party whip, although Green Party whips are called musterers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens.org.nz/press-releases/musterer-replaces-whips-green-party|title=The Musterer replaces whips in the Green Party|last=Donald|first=Rod|date=14 Dec 1999|year=|website=|publisher=Green Party of New Zealand|publication-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030121510/https://www.greens.org.nz/press-releases/musterer-replaces-whips-green-party|archive-date=30 October 2013|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties with 25 to 44 members are allowed two whips (one senior and one junior), and parties with 45 or more members are entitled to three whips (one senior and two junior).

Whips act in an administrative role, making sure members of their party are in the debating chamber when required and organising members of their party to speak during debates. Since the introduction of proportional representation in 1996, divisions which require all members in the chamber to vote by taking sides (termed a ''personal vote'') are rarely used, except for conscience issues. Instead, one of the party's whips votes on behalf of all the members of their party, by declaring how many members are in favour and/or how many members are opposed. They also cast proxy votes for single-member parties whose member is not in the chamber at the time of the vote, and also cast proxy vote during personal votes for absent members of their parties and for absent members of associated single-member parties.

== South Africa ==
Although South Africa uses a proportional representation system, the concept of a political party whip, which was inherited from colonial British rule, has been maintained &lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Monitoring Group. [http://www.pmg.org.za/node/17040 Structure of Government - Office bearers of legislative institutions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chief Whips on Parliament Website. [https://www.parliament.gov.za/chief-whips]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2017, [[ANC]] secretary general [[Gwede Mantashe]] said "Voting according to conscience doesn't work in a political party system. We all get into the list of things and go to Parliament as parliamentarians of the ANC [...] There will be no voting against the ANC" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Thulani Gqirana|title=ANC MPs will toe party line in no confidence motion - chief whip|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-mps-will-toe-party-line-in-no-confidence-motion-chief-whip-20170406|website=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== United Kingdom ==

In British politics, the [[chief whip]] of the governing party in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is customarily appointed as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury]] so that the incumbent, who represents the whips in general, has a seat and a voice in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. By virtue of holding the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, the government chief whip has an official residence at [[12 Downing Street]], although the chief whip's office is currently located at 9 Downing Street. Whips report to the prime minister on any possible backbench revolts and the general opinion of MPs within the party, and upon the exercise of the [[patronage]], which is used to motivate and reward loyalty.

{{anchor|UKLineWhip}}In the sense of 'voting instructions', there are three categories of whip in British politics that are issued on particular business. An expressed instruction on how to vote could constitute a breach of [[parliamentary privilege]], so the party's wishes are expressed unequivocally but indirectly. These whips are issued to MPs in the form of a letter outlining the parliamentary schedule, with a sentence such as "Your attendance is absolutely essential" next to each debate in which there will be a vote, underlined one, two or three times according to the severity of the whip:
*A ''single-line whip'' is a guide to what the party's policy would indicate, and notification of when the vote is expected to take place; this is non-binding for attendance or voting.
*A ''two-line whip'', sometimes known as a ''double-line whip'', is an instruction to attend and vote; partially binding for voting, attendance required unless prior permission given by the whip.
*A ''three-line whip'' is a strict instruction to attend and vote, breach of which would normally have serious consequences. Permission not to attend may be given by the whip, but a serious reason is needed. Breach of a three-line whip can lead to expulsion from the parliamentary political group in extreme circumstances and may lead to expulsion from the party. Consequently, three-line whips are generally only issued on key issues, such as [[Motion of Confidence|votes of confidence]] and [[Loss of Supply|supply]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The nature of three-line whips and the potential punishments for revolt vary dramatically among parties and legislatures. Disobeying a three-line whip is a newsworthy event, indicating as it does a potential mutiny, for example, the decision on 10 July 2012 by 91 Conservative MPs to vote against Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] on the issue of [[reform of the House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2171447/Coalition-war-Lords-reform-Senior-Lib-Dems-vow-revenge-flagship-reform-scuppered-uprising-Tory-benches.html | work=Daily Mail | first=James | last=Chapman | title=Coalition suffers biggest rebellion yet as Tory backbenchers scupper Clegg's dream of Lords reform, leaving senior Lib Dems vowing revenge | date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
{{more footnotes|section|date=March 2016}}
In the United States there are legislatures at the local (city councils, town councils, county boards, etc.), state, and federal levels. The federal legislature (Congress), the legislatures in all states except for [[Nebraska Legislature|Nebraska]], and many county and city legislative bodies are divided along party lines and have whips, as well as majority and minority leaders. The whip is also the assistant majority or assistant minority leader.

Both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]], have majority and minority whips. They in turn have subordinate "regional" whips. While members of Congress often vote along party lines, the influence of the whip is weaker than in the UK system. One reason is that a considerable amount of money is raised by individual candidates, and members of Congress, or any other person, cannot be expelled from a political party, which are formed simply by open registration. In addition, because [[preselection]] of candidates for office is generally done through a [[primary election]] open to a wide number of voters, candidates who may support their constituents' views rather than the party line cannot easily be rejected by their party.

Because members of Congress cannot serve simultaneously in executive positions, a whip in the United States cannot bargain for votes by using potential promotion or demotion in a sitting administration as an inducement. There is, however, a highly structured committee system in both houses of Congress, and a whip may be able to offer promotion or threaten demotion within that system instead. In the House of Representatives, the influence of a single member individually is relatively small and therefore depends a great deal on the representative's seniority (i.e., in most cases, on the length of time they have held office).

In the Senate, the majority whip is the third-highest ranking individual in the majority party (the party with the most seats). The majority whip is outranked by the majority leader and, unofficially, the [[president pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]]. The office of president pro tempore is largely honorific and usually given to the longest-serving senator of the majority, the majority whip is in reality the second-ranking senator in the majority conference. Similarly, in the House, the majority whip is outranked by both the [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|majority leader]] and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker]]. Unlike the Senate's presiding officer, the Speaker is the leader of his or her party's caucus in the House.

In both the House and the Senate, the minority whip is the second highest-ranking individual in the minority party (the party with the lesser number of legislators in a legislative body), outranked only by the [[minority leader]].

The whip position was created in the House of Representatives in 1897 by Republican Speaker [[Thomas Brackett Reed|Thomas Reed]], who appointed [[James A. Tawney]] as the first whip. The first Democratic whip, [[Oscar Wilder Underwood]], was appointed around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/house_history/dem_whips.html |title = Democratic Whips |publisher = Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate = April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://majoritywhip.house.gov/index.cfm?p=HistoryOfWhip |title=History of the Whip |publisher=Office of the house majority whip |accessdate=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senate, the position was created in 1913 by [[John W. Kern]], chair of the Democratic caucus, when he appointed [[J. Hamilton Lewis]] as the first whip, while Republicans later chose [[James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr.|James Wadsworth]] as the party's first in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Most Exclusive Club |last=Gould |first=Lewis L. |year=2005 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02778-1 |pages=57, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Whips in other parts of the world ==
In most countries not now or formerly under control of the [[British Empire]] or part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]—like most of continental Europe and Asia—the position of whip does not officially exist. The whip's responsibilities are mostly exercised by the party leader or the leader of a parliamentary faction themselves.

==In popular culture==
British author and politician [[Michael Dobbs]] wrote a trilogy of books, centred around a fictional party whip named [[Francis Urquhart]], which was dramatised and broadcast on the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] between 1990 and 1995. The first book in the trilogy, titled ''House of Cards'', lent its name to [[House of Cards (UK TV series)|the original UK television series]] and has also been used as the title of subsequent series based on other countries' political systems. In ''House of Cards'', Francis Urquhart is the [[Chief Whip]] for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]] and the trilogy charts his ambitious rise through his party's ranks until he becomes [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. 

In the American remake of ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'', [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] is the [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives#Whips|House Majority Whip]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|US Democratic Party]]. The series charts Underwood's ambitious rise through his party's ranks until he becomes [[President of the United States|President]]. The name ''Frank Underwood'' was both an acknowledgement of the original trilogy's protagonist ''Francis Urquhart'' and to the US political system itself, as [[Oscar Underwood]] was the first ever party whip for the US Democratic Party.

In the UK there is a reproduction of [[James Graham (playwright)|James Graham]]'s play titled ''[[This House (play)|This House]]'' that deals with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] whips during the 1970s.

'''Zmotoryzowane Odwody Milicji Obywatelskie "ZOMO"''' (''Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia''), were [[paramilitary]]-[[police]] formations during the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Communist Era]], in the [[Polish People's Republic]]. These purportedly elite units of [[Milicja Obywatelska|Citizens' Militia]] (MO) were created to fight dangerous criminals, provide security during mass events, and help in the case of [[natural disaster]]s and other crises; however, they became known instead for their brutal and sometimes lethal actions of [[riot control]] and quelling [[civil rights]] protests.&lt;ref name="zomo-3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.milicja.waw.pl/?zomo,3 | title=ZOMO | publisher=Fundacja Edukacji Historycznej | work=Historia Milicji Obywatelskiej at ''Milicja.waw.pl'' | date=2007 | accessdate=8 October 2013 | author=Michał Kępiński, pres.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
ZOMO units were created on December 24, 1956 under the direct command of the President of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Poland and first used in 1957. Their mission statement was defined as "the protection of the nation," and their main role was as a rapid-response police force, structured after and trained by the instructors from the [[Schutzpolizei]] of [[East Germany]]. From 1972, the duties of ZOMO included [[counter-terrorism]] (including countering [[aircraft hijacking]]s), with the elite Special Platoons of the ZOMO ([[polish language|pl]]. ''Plutony Specjalne ZOMO'') created in 1978. As opposition to the communist government in Poland grew, the units were expanded to counter the growing unrest, and their role became more of anti-riot police. In 1968, ZOMO was used to disperse the student protests during the [[1968 Polish political crisis]], leading to the reform of the formation. Two years later in 1970, thousands of troops from the [[Polish People's Army]] and ZOMO were used to quell the [[Polish 1970 protests]], killing dozens of people and injuring more than 1,000.&lt;ref name="zomo-3"/&gt;

==Martial law ==
[[File:Miezian ZOMO.jpg|thumb|"ZOMO arrived for an action", a political caricature from the 1980s]]

The ZOMO gained the most of their infamy during the period of [[martial law in Poland]] (1981–1983). During this time period their brutal actions against peaceful protesters often affiliated with the oppositionist [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement, and the subsequent lack of [[prosecution]] of those responsible for deaths of protesters, were major factors in bringing down the communist regime. To parody the communist [[newspeak]] during that time they were often sarcastically called "The beating heart of the Party" ([[polish language|pl]]. ''Bijące serce Partii''). Since 1990 several trials against former ZOMO members and their political leaders took place, most prominently in the case of the massacre in the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] (where [[Pacification of Wujek|nine people were killed and 21 wounded]] when [[Katowice]]'s Special Platoon opened fire on the striking miners in 1981 in the bloodiest incident of the martial law era).&lt;ref name="zomo-3"/&gt;

==Personnel and equipment==
From the mid-1970s ZOMO was reputed to be one of the best trained and equipped police formations in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. A candidate for ZOMO had to have the height of at least 180&amp;nbsp;cm and the weight of at least 90&amp;nbsp;kg. After the 1968 expansion, people conscripted to the military could optionally serve their draft in ZOMO (during the martial law, the military [[reservist]]s who had served in ZOMO were called up to the squads of [[ORMO]], reserve units of MO). The formation numbered more than 12,000 members in the late 1980s (twice the original designation of 6,600), quartered in [[barracks]] in the major cities across the country. The martial-law-era ZOMO members were equipped with various police and military vehicles (including [[BTR-60]] [[armoured personnel carrier]]s in the Special Platoons) and various [[firearm]]s (including [[shotgun]]s, [[submachine gun]]s and [[automatic rifle]]s) as well as various types of riot equipment (such as [[Club (weapon)|baton]]s, [[tear gas]] grenades, [[water cannon]] trucks, [[rubber bullet]]s, metal and plastic [[riot shield]]s and visored helmets). From 1968 they wore military-style [[uniforms]] with a very similar camouflage pattern to the one used by the Polish People's Army.&lt;ref name="zomo-3"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The ZOMO's last action took place on July 3, 1989, when they dispersed a demonstration against the presidential candidature of General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] (former leader of the [[Military Council of National Salvation]]). The units were disbanded on September 7, 1989, following the fall of the communist system, and replaced with the OPP (riot control) and SPAP (rapid response and counter-terrorism) units of [[Policja]] (the Polish police).&lt;ref name="zomo-3"/&gt;

In today's Poland the word "ZOMO" (or ''zomowiec'', the ZOMO-man) is a [[pejorative term]] used by protesters to denote all kinds of riot police (just as the word [[Gestapo]] is sometimes shouted out to describe [[police brutality]]).
