'''Adriaan "Aat" de Peijper''' (died 1998)&lt;ref name=kas&gt;Jan Kas, [http://www.refdag.nl/nieuws/binnenland/kostbare_postzegel_met_nijkerkse_stempel_geveild_voor_16_000_euro_1_823253 Kostbare postzegel met Nijkerkse stempel geveild voor 16.000 euro], Reformatisch Dagblad, 28 April 2004. {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Dutch industrialist and [[philatelist]] whose collection of Dutch, Dutch colonial, and British Commonwealth stamps included several world rarities.

==Career==
Until 1976 De Peijper was director of a pharmaceutical distribution company in [[Etten-Leur]].&lt;ref name=kas/&gt; De Peijper and his company Centrafarm won a number of court battles concerning their redistribution of medicines within the EU,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WkCjxAXZFDsC&amp;pg=PA17 Weer kort geding tegen geneesmiddelenimporteur], Nieuwe Leidsche Courant, 26 August 1976. {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; including some against [[Sterling Drug]] / Winthrop that are considered landmark cases.&lt;ref&gt;Floris O.W. Vogelaar, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WkCjxAXZFDsC&amp;pg=PA17 The EU Competition Rules: Landmark Cases of the EU Courts and the European Commission], pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lesnouvelles.lesi.org/lesnouvelles1974/lesNouvellesPDF12-74/Landmark-Decision-by-EC-Court.pdf Landmark Decision by EC Court]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- In principal, the Adriaan de Peijper in the court cases could be a cousin in the same business, but the fact that the stamp collector was director of a pharmaceutical company in Etten-Leur (Centrafarm is currently based in Etten-Leur) and that the collector retired in 1976 (after Adriaan de Peijper and Centrafarm won the last court case) seems to support this link. --&gt; 

==Philately==
De Peijper began collecting stamps from a young age but according to his wife Mrs M.W. de Peijper-Pieksma, it was not until later in life that he was able to afford the more expensive items missing from his collection. He bought many items from the Samos collection, and also items formerly in the [[John Robert Boker, Jr.|Boker]], [[Maurice Burrus|Burrus]], [[Alfred H. Caspary|Casapry]], and [[Louise Boyd Dale|Dale-Lichtenstein]] collections.&lt;ref name=collection&gt;''The Collection Aat de Peijper''. De Nederlandsche Postzegelveiling, Amsterdam, 2013. pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

His collection was principally of the stamps of the Netherlands, with a focus on the first issue,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vandieten.nl/catalogus_629/ Auction catalogue Netherlands collection Aat de Peijper, part II]&lt;/ref&gt; the British Commonwealth and Dutch colonies. Among the rarities in the collection was a 1925 Kenya and Uganda £100 (SG105) unused [[plate number]] postage stamp (signed A. Diena in the margin),&lt;ref&gt;''The Collection Aat de Peijper'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; one of four unused copies known in private collections and museums.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.knbf.nl/uploads/pdf/nieuwsbrieven/043%20Nieuwsbrief%20november%202013.pdf Nieuwsbrief]'', KNBF, Vol. 4, No. 43, 15 November 2013, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Another rare item was a 1925 unused Ceylon 1000R (SG323) plate number single with a certificate by Friedl.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collection Aat de Peijper'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Both were formerly in the Samos collection. The de Peijper collection was auctioned by De Nederlandsche Postzegelveiling in 2013, with the £100 Kenya and Uganda stamp reckoned to be the most valuable stamp ever to be auctioned in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/npv-idUSnBw255497a+100+BSW20131025 Rare British Commonwealth Stamp to Be Auctioned at Dutch Auction House NPV.] [[Reuters]], 25 October 2013.

The '''Algonquin Hotel''' is an American [[Hotel#Historic hotels|historic hotel]] located at 59 West 44th Street in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The hotel has been designated as a New York City Historic Landmark.

The 181-room hotel, opened in 1902, was designed by architect [[Starrett &amp; van Vleck|Goldwin Starrett]]. It was originally conceived as a residential hotel but was quickly converted to a traditional lodging establishment. Its first owner-manager, [[Frank Case]] (who bought the hotel in 1927), established many of the hotel's traditions. Perhaps its best-known tradition is hosting literary and theatrical notables, most prominently the members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]].

== History ==

The Algonquin Hotel was originally designed as an apartment hotel, whose owner planned to rent rooms and suites on year-long leases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Frank Case, upon discovering that [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes had been the first residents of the area, persuaded the owner to christen it "The Algonquin" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Case 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==The Algonquin Round Table==
:{{main|Algonquin Round Table}}

In June 1919 the hotel became the site of the daily meetings of the [[Algonquin Round Table]], a group of journalists, authors, publicists and actors who gathered to exchange [[bon mot]]s over lunch in the main dining room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some of the core members of the "Vicious Circle" included [[Franklin P. Adams]], [[Robert Benchley]], [[Heywood Broun]], [[Marc Connelly]], [[Jane Grant]], [[Ruth Hale (feminist)|Ruth Hale]], [[George S. Kaufman]], [[Harpo Marx]], [[Neysa McMein]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Harold Ross]], [[Robert E. Sherwood]] and [[Alexander Woollcott]].

At the end of World War I, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' writers and Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for lunch at The Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, received a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered in the Rose Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Edna Ferber were also a part of this August assembly; these individuals influenced writers like [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]]. They founded ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.

Frank Case, owner of the hotel, ensured a daily luncheon for the talented group of young writers by treating them to free celery and popovers; more importantly, they were provided with their own table and waiter. Edna Ferber, Franklin P. Adams, George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Marc Connelly eventually joined the group, expanding its membership. All members were affiliated with the Algonquin Round Table, although they referred to themselves as the Vicious Circle.

Visitors often request to dine at the actual “round table” where members originally met for decades.

==The Oak Room==
The Oak Room at the Algonquin was long one of New York City's premier [[cabaret]] nightclubs. Opened in 1939 (as the Oak Room Supper Club),&lt;ref name=LostCity&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lostnewyorkcity.blogspot.com/2012/02/algonquins-oak-room-is-dead.html |title=The Algonquin's Oak Room is Dead |author=Brooks of Sheffield |date=February 2, 2012 |work=Lost City |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was soon closed on account of World War II, reopened as a regular venue in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/oak-room-closing-algonquin_n_1252187.html |title=NYC's Algonquin Closes Legendary Oak Room |date=February 3, 2010 |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and closed for good in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203889904577199532493946126 |title=Algonquin Hotel Closes Oak Room |author=Will Friedwald |date=February 3, 2012 |work=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Before 1939, it had been called the Pergola Room and was the first meeting place of what became the Algonquin Round Table).&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2012/02/04/oak-room-swan-song/ |title=Oak Room swan song |author=Rita Delfiner |date=February 4, 2012 |work=New York Post |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions ==

=== Cats ===
The hotel has a tradition of keeping a cat that has the run of the hotel. The practice dates to the 1930s, when Frank Case took in a stray male cat that was initially named "Rusty." Hotel lore says actor [[John Barrymore]] suggested the cat needed a more "dignified" name, so the cat was renamed "Hamlet." Nowadays, whenever the hotel has a male cat, he's named Hamlet; but if the hotel has a female cat, she's named "Matilda." The last Algonquin cat, a Matilda, to gain notice was a [[Ragdoll]] that was named 2006 cat of the year at the Westchester (New York) Cat Show.  Visitors could spot Matilda on her personal [[chaise longue|chaise lounge]] in the lobby; she could also be found in her favorite places: behind the computer on the front desk, or lounging on a baggage cart. The doormen fed her and the general manager's executive assistant answered Matilda's e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Matilda III died in October, 2017.  Since then, Hamlet VIII has taken up shelter at the hotel having been rescued from a cat colony on Long Island.

Since the 1930s the hotel holds an annual feline fashion show every summer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/algonquin-hotels-cat-show|title=A Purrfectly Adorable Night at the Algonquin Hotel’s Cat Show|last=Eby|first=Margaret|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2018 was a fundraiser for the Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animalalliancenyc.org/events/featured/algonquin/index.htm|title=The Algonquin Cat's Annual Celebration|website=Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.njherald.com/20180807/algonquin-hotel-throws-a-feline-fashion-show#|title=Algonquin Hotel throws a feline fashion show|last=|first=|date=7 August 2018|work=New Jersey Herald|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cocktails ===
Although the Algonquin was "dry" even before [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] (Case closed the hotel bar in 1917&lt;ref&gt;Case 172&lt;/ref&gt; and had harsh words for those who ran [[speakeasy|speakeasies]]&lt;ref&gt;Case 175–7&lt;/ref&gt;), the hotel does have an eponymous cocktail, composed of [[rye whiskey]], [[Noilly Prat]] and [[pineapple]] juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Lunch discounts for struggling writers ===
In keeping with Frank Case's long-standing tradition of sending popovers and celery to the more impoverished members of the Round Table, the Algonquin offers lunch discounts to struggling writers.&lt;ref name="Bleyer" /&gt; Formerly, writers on tour could stay one night at the hotel free in exchange for an autographed copy of their book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Landmark status==
The Algonquin Round Table, as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged there, helped earn the hotel its status as a [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 14th to 59th Streets|New York City Historic Landmark]].

'''Atiku Abubakar''' [[Order of the Niger|GCON]] (born 25 November 1946) is a Nigerian politician and business tycoon. He was [[vice-president of Nigeria]] 1999-2007 under President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] representing the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP).

Abubakar worked in the Nigeria Customs Service for twenty years, rising to become the Deputy Director, as the second highest position in the Service was then known. He retired in April 1989 and took up full-time business and politics. &lt;ref&gt;https://allafrica.com/stories/201012230467.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He ran for the office of governor in the [[Gongola State]] (now [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]] and [[Taraba State|Taraba]] States) in 1991, and for the Presidency in 1993, placing third after [[MKO Abiola]] and [[Babagana Kingibe]] in the [[Social Democratic Party (Nigeria)|Social Democratic Party (SDP)]] primaries.

In 1998 he was elected Governor of Adamawa State. While still Governor-Elect he was selected by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential candidate Olusegun Obasanjo as his running mate. The duo went on to win elections in February 1999, and Abubakar was sworn-in as Nigeria's second democratically elected vice president on 29 May 1999.
&lt;ref&gt;

Abubakar's second term as Vice President was marked by a stormy relationship with President Obasanjo. His bid to succeed Obasanjo did not receive the latter's support, and it took a judgment of the Supreme Court to allow Abubakar contest after he was initially disqualified by the [[Independent National Electoral Commission]] on the grounds that he had been indicted for financial misconduct by an investigating panel set up at Obasanjo's behest. The Supreme Court ordered the electoral commission to restore Abubakar's name onto the presidential ballot. Abubakar ran on the platform of the [[Action Congress]], having quit the PDP on account of his issues with President Obasanjo. Abubakar lost the election, placing third after [[Umaru Yar'Adua]] and [[Muhammadu Buhari]] of the [[All Nigeria Peoples Party|All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP)]].

Abubakar is a co-founder of Intels, an oil servicing business with extensive operations in Nigeria and abroad. He is also the founder of Adama Beverages Limited, and the [[American University of Nigeria|American University of Nigeria (AUN)]], both in [[Yola, Adamawa]].

== Early life ==
Atiku Abubakar was born on November 25, 1946 to a Fulani trader and farmer Garba Abubakar, and his second wife, Aisha Kande, in Jada village of Adamawa State. Atiku Abubakar became the only child of his parents when his only sister died at infancy. Atiku’s father and mother divorced before his father died in 1957 and his mother remarried. Eventually, his mother died in 1984 of heart attack. Atiku Abubakar could not start school when he ought to because his father was opposed to him obtaining western education. When his not going to school was noticed, his father was arrested and jailed until he paid a fine. Consequently, Atiku Abubakar got registered into Jada Primary School at the age of eight. After his primary school, Atiku was admitted into Adamawa Provincial Secondary School Yola in the year 1960. He later finished his secondary school in 1965 after he made grade three in the West African School Certificate Examination. Atiku Abubakar then proceeded to Nigerian Police College, Kaduna. He left the college for a position as tax officer in the Regional Ministry of Finance. Later he got admission to study at the School of Hygiene Kano in 1966. In 1967, he graduated with a Diploma. That same year, Atiku Abubakar was admitted for a Law Diploma at Ahmadu Bello University on a scholarship. He graduated in 1969 and got employed by Nigeria Customs Service that same year.

== Education ==
Like many of his generation, Abubakar's father was opposed to the idea of Western education, and tried to keep Abubakar out of the traditional school system. When the government discovered that Abubakar was not attending mandatory schooling, his father spent a few days in jail until Aisha Kande's mother paid the fine
At the age of eight Abubakar enrolled in the Jada Primary School. In 1960, he was admitted to Adamawa Provincial Secondary School in Yola where he did well in English Language and Literature, struggled with Physics and Chemistry and Mathematics. He graduated with a Grade Three WASSCE/GCE Certificate in 1965.

Following secondary school, Abubakar studied a short while at the Nigeria Police College in   [[Kaduna]]  . He left the College when he was unable to present an O-Level Mathematics result.He worked briefly as a Tax Officer in the regional Ministry of Finance, from where he gained admission to the school of Hygiene in [[Kano]] in 1966.
He graduated with a Diploma in 1967, having served as Interim Student Union President at the school. In 1967 he enrolled for a Law Diploma at the [[Ahmadu Bello University]] Institute of Administration, on a scholarship from regional government. After graduation in 1969, during the [[Nigerian Civil War]], he was employed by the [[Nigerian Customs Service|Nigeria Customs Service]].

== Marriages and family ==
Abubakar has four wives and is the father of 28 children.

While at Idi-Iroko, Abubakar met nineteen-year-old [[Titilayo Albert]], who he secretly married in December 1971, in Lagos, because her family was initially opposed to the union. On 26 October 1972, Titilayo delivered a baby girl they named Fatima. She later gave birth to Adamu, Halima and Aminu.

In January 1979 he married Ladi Yakubu as his second wife. "I wanted to expand the Abubakar family. I felt extremely lonely as a child. I had no brother and no sister. I did not want my children to be as lonely as I was. This is why I married more than one wife. My wives are my sisters, my friends, and my advisers and they complement one another,"  Abubakar has said.&lt;ref&gt;Atiku: The Story of Atiku Abubakar, by Onukaba Adinoyi-Ojo&lt;/ref&gt; He has six children with Ladi: Abba, Atiku, Zainab, Ummi-Hauwa, Maryam and Rukaiyatu.

In 1983 he married his third wife, Princess Rukaiyatu, daughter of the late Lamido of Adamawa, Aliyu Musdafa. She gave birth to Aisha, Hadiza, Aliyu (named after her late father), Asmau, Mustafa, Laila and Abdulsalam. His fourth wife, Fatima Shettima, followed in 1986. Fatima gave birth to her first child Amina (Meena), Mohammed and two sets of twins Ahmed and Shehu, Zainab and Aisha then her last daughter Hafsat.

Abubakar later divorced Ladi, allowing him to marry, as his fourth wife (the maximum permitted him as a Muslim), Jennifer.

== Business career ==
Abubakar started out in the real estate business during his early days as a Customs Officer. In 1974 he applied for and received a 31,000 naira loan to build his first house in Yola, which he put up for rent. From proceeds of the rent he purchased another plot, and built a second house. He continued this way, building a sizeable portfolio of property in Yola.

In 1981 he moved into agriculture, acquiring 2,500 hectares of land near Yola to start a maize and cotton farm. The business fell on hard times and closed in 1986. "My first foray into agriculture, in the 1980s, ended in failure," he wrote in an April 2014 blog.&lt;ref&gt;Atiku Abubakar (30 April 2014). [http://atiku.org/aa/2014/04/30/the-business-of-agriculture-a-personal-narrative/ The business of Agriculture – a personal narrative] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001721/http://atiku.org/aa/2014/04/30/the-business-of-agriculture-a-personal-narrative/ |date=4 March 2016 }}. Atiku.org. (Retrieved 1 August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; He then ventured into trading, buying and selling truckloads of rice, flour and sugar.

Abubakar's most important business move came while he was a Customs Officer at the Apapa Ports. Gabrielle Volpi, an Italian businessman in Nigeria, invited him to set up Nigeria Container Services (NICOTES), a logistics company operating within the Ports. NICOTES would go on to provide immense wealth to Abubakar. Conflict of interest accusations have since trailed him on account of his involvement in business while a civil servant, who exercised supervisory authority.

On his part, Abubakar has defended the decision, saying his involvement was limited to the ownership of shares (which government rules permitted), and that he was not involved in the day-to-day running of the business. NICOTES would later be rebranded INTELS, and go on to feature prominently in accusations of money laundering levelled against Abubakar by the U.S. government during his Vice Presidency.

Abubakar's business empire also includes a beverage manufacturing plant in Yola, as well as an animal feed factory.

== Early political career ==
Abubakar's first foray into politics was in the early 1980s, when he worked behind-the-scenes on the governorship campaign of [[Bamanga Tukur]], who at that time was managing director of the Nigeria Ports Authority. He canvassed for votes on behalf of Tukur, and also donated to the campaign. Towards the end of his Customs career, he met [[Shehu Musa Yar'Adua]], who had been second-in-command of the military government that ruled Nigeria between 1976 and 1979. Abubakar was drawn by Yar'Adua into the political meetings that were now happening regularly in Yar'Adua's Lagos home. In 1989 Abubakar was elected a National Vice-Chairman of the Peoples Front of Nigeria, the political association led by Yar'Adua, to participate in the transition programme initiated by Head of State Ibrahim Babangida. The Peoples Front of Nigeria included politicians such as [[Umaru Musa Yar'Adua]], [[Babalola Borishade]], [[Bola Tinubu]], [[Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila]], [[Rabiu Kwankwaso]] and  [[Sabo Bakin Zuwo]].

Abubakar won a seat to represent his constituency at the 1989 Constituent Assembly, set up to decide a new constitution for Nigeria. The People's Front was eventually denied  registration by the government (none of the groups that applied was registered), and found a place within the Social Democratic Party, one of the two parties decreed into existence by the regime.

=== First gubernatorial run ===
On 1 September 1990, Abubakar announced his Gongola State gubernatorial bid. A year later, before the elections could hold, Gongola State was broken up into two – Adamawa and Taraba States – by the Federal Government. Abubakar fell into the new Adamawa State. After the contest he won the SDP Primaries in November 1991, but was soon disqualified by government from contesting the elections.

=== First presidential run  ===
A similar fate – disqualification by the military – would befall [[Shehu Musa Yar'Adua]], Abubakar's friend and political mentor, in his 1992 bid for the presidential primary of the SDP. With no chance of contesting for the presidency, Yar'Adua decided to push Abubakar forward as the focal point of SDP's ambitions. Abubakar came third in the convention primary. But because [[MKO Abiola]], the winner, had won by only about 400 votes a run-off was due. Abubakar stepped down for Abiola, asking his supporters to cast their votes for him, with an unwritten agreement that Abiola would announce Abubakar as his running mate. Abiola won the SDP ticket, and announced [[Babagana Kingibe]], the runner-up, as his running mate.

=== Second gubernatorial run ===
In 1998 Abubakar launched a bid for the governorship of [[Adamawa State]] on the platform of the People's Democratic Party. He won the December 1998 elections, but before he could be sworn in he was tapped by the PDP's presidential candidate, former Head of State Olusegun Obasanjo, as his vice-presidential candidate. The Obasanjo-Abubakar ticket won the 27 February 1999 presidential election with 62.78 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Staff (1 March 1999).

Abubakar was sworn in as Vice-President of Nigeria on 29 May 1999. He presided over the National Council on Privatization, overseeing the sale of hundreds of loss-making and poorly managed public enterprises.

In 2006, Abubakar was involved in a bitter public battle with his boss, President Olusegun Obasanjo, ostensibly arising from the latter's bid to amend certain provisions of the constitution to take another shot at the presidency (for the third consecutive time).&lt;ref&gt;Amaechi Dike (9 October 2006).

In a November 2013 interview Abubakar is quoted as saying, regarding Obasanjo's alleged attempts to justify his third term bid: "[He] informed me that 'I left power twenty years ago, I left Mubarak in office, I left Mugabe in office, I left Eyadema in office, I left Umar Bongo, and even Paul Biya and I came back and they are still in power; and I just did eight years and you are asking me to go; why?' And I responded to him by telling him that Nigeria is not Libya, not Egypt, not Cameroun, and not Togo; I said you must leave; even if it means both of us lose out, but you cannot stay."&lt;ref&gt;Adeoye, Gbenro (2 November 2013).

Abubakar launched the True Federalism campaign in 2017. He has been delivering speeches all over the country inspiring Nigerians on the need to restructure the country. He has been receiving massive endorsement for his stand on True [[Federalism]].

He recently declared at an event where he was conferred the award Hero Of [[Democracy]] by Hall of Grace Magazine.

“Political decentralization will also help to deepen and strengthen our democracy as it will encourage more accountability. Citizens are more likely to demand accountability when governments spend their tax money rather than rent collected from an impersonal source.”

He also said: "True Federalism will encourage states to competes to attract investments and skilled workers rather than merely waiting for monthly revenue allocation from Abuja"

Many of his speeches have caused positive stir nationwide as Nigerians are supporting the idea of True [[Federalism]] which involves allowing states to have control over their resources most especially the South South and South East of Nigeria.

B&amp;H Photo Video targets professional [[photographer]]s and [[videographer]]s. Although it is visited by more than 5,000 customers every day from Sunday to Friday, most of the company's business comes from the Internet and corporate sales. It operates a warehouse located in [[Florence, NJ]].&lt;ref name="sales"/&gt; The company carries a wide range of consumer electronics products, with an emphasis on professional and specialty photographic equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/AboutUs.jsp|title=About B&amp;H {{!}} B&amp;H Photo Video|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{citation needed|https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/AboutUs.jsp=|date=December 2018}}

The business owner, Herman Schreiber, and many of the store's employees are observant [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] [[Hasidic Jews]]. The store is closed on [[Shabbat]], most [[Jewish holiday]]s (except for [[Hanukkah]], when business dealings are permitted), and [[Christmas]]. Although the web site remains open, [[e-commerce]] orders are not taken or shipped between Friday evening and Saturday evening, and on Jewish holidays.&lt;ref name='B_H_homepage'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bhphotovideo.com/ | title = B&amp;H Photo Video

==History==
B&amp;H opened in 1973 as a storefront film shop at 17 Warren Street in [[Tribeca]], and took its name from the initials of owners Blimie Schreiber and her husband, Herman. Later in the 1970s, B&amp;H moved to a large loft at 119 [[17th Street (Manhattan)|West 17th Street]] between [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh]] Avenues in the [[Photo District]] and began to expand its stock to a wider range of film and photography products. In 1997, the store moved to its present location.  In addition to photo and video gear, the company offers computers, lighting, audio, TV's, mobile, drones, optics, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/HelpCenter/AboutUs.jsp|title=About B&amp;H {{!}} B&amp;H Photo Video|website=www.bhphotovideo.com|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It now has more than 2,000 employees.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/48034|newspaper= [[The New York Sun]]|title=B &amp; H Photo Emerges as a N.Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">'''Christian Augustus Henry Allhusen''' (1806–1890) was a [[Danes|Danish]]-[[England|English]] chemical manufacturer based in the North East of England. Born in [[Kiel]] when it was in the Danish  Duchy of Holstein, he and his family were displaced when [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Marshall Davoust]], [[Napoleon]]'s "Iron Marshall," occupied the family home as his headquarters. Allhusen was employed by Koch &amp; Sons, grain merchants of [[Rostock]] and then moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], where he was employed by Campbell &amp; Reveley, also grain merchants.&lt;ref name ="Allen"&gt;{{cite book   | title = Some Founders of the Chemical Industry: Men to be Remembered | author= John Fenwick Allen | publisher = Sherratt &amp; Hughes  | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1GYoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=Christian+Allhusen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiThfTx4PHbAhUDOKwKHdFEDLIQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Allhusen&amp;f=false | date = 1906 | pages = 231 - 248  | isbn =   | accessdate = 26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allhusen became a British citizen by a private Act of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | title = The Parliamentary Debates (Authorized Edition), Volume 30 | author=  | publisher = Wyman| location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ky9VAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=Christian+Allhusen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju0NLn8vHbAhVGL6wKHegaBlk4ChDoAQhVMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Allhusen&amp;f=false | date = 1835 | page = | isbn =   | accessdate = 26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later went into partnership with [[Henry Bolckow]] and expanded into the ship and insurance brokerage business.&lt;ref name = "Allen"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Joseph"&gt;{{cite book   | title = The Navigation Laws of Great Britain, Historically and Practically Considered, with Reference to Commercial and National Defence  | author= Joseph ALLEN (of Greenwich Hospital.) | publisher = Baily Bros. &amp; James Ridgway  | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iPYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Christian+Allhusen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKqtm1-PHbAhVPeawKHZeUDm44HhDoAQhWMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Allhusen&amp;f=false | date = 1849 | pages = 107 - 112  | isbn =   | accessdate = 26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Reid"&gt;{{cite book   | title = Middlesbrough and Its Jubilee: A History of the Iron and Steel Industries, with Biographies of Pioneers  | author= Sir Hugh Gilzean-Reid | publisher = "The Gazette" Printing and Publishing Offices  | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iPYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Christian+Allhusen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKqtm1-PHbAhVPeawKHZeUDm44HhDoAQhWMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Allhusen&amp;f=false | date = 1881 | pages = 113 - 114  | isbn =   | accessdate = 26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, Allhusen purchased a soap works in [[Gateshead]], and began the manufacture of chemicals, eventually calling the company C. Allhusen &amp; Sons. In 1871, Allhusen converted his enterprise into a [[joint-stock company]], Newcastle Chemical Works, Ltd. He made a large fortune, and was influential in the region as company director and shareholder in such companies as the Northumberland &amp; Durham District Bank, the Newcastle &amp; Gates Water Company and the Consett Iron Works. He was an active member of the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce and the Tyne Commission.&lt;ref name = Allen/&gt;

In 1854, Allhusen was among local industrialists urging construction of a new [[Wharf|quay]] for Gateshead. When the quay was eventually constructed, the local government failed to include necessary transportation facilities to allow efficient transport to and from the quay facility. As a result, the quay complex required years of subsidies and struggled to avoid failure as Allhusen had predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | title = North East England, 1850-1914: The Dynamics of a Maritime-industrial Region | author= Graeme J.

'''Constantin Argetoianu''' ({{OldStyleDate|15 March|1871|3 March}} &amp;ndash; 6 February 1955) was a [[Romania]]n politician, one of the best-known personalities of [[Interwar period|interwar]] [[Greater Romania]], who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] between 28 September and 23 November 1939. His [[memoirs]], ''Memorii. Pentru cei de mâine. Amintiri din vremea celor de ieri'' ("Memoirs. For those of tomorrow. Recollections of yesterday's world")—a cross section of Romanian society, were made known for the sharp critique of several major figures in Romanian politics (using a sarcastic tone which had made his previous political speeches notorious).&lt;ref&gt;Otu; Slabey Roucek, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an exceptionally prosperous man (a noted [[Bucharest Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] player and landowner in [[Breasta]], [[Dolj County]]), and his frequent change in political allegiances was attributed by some of his contemporaries to his financial independence.&lt;ref name="Savu; Slabey Roucek, p.76"&gt;Savu; Slabey Roucek, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a [[combat medic]] with the rank of captain in the [[Second Balkan War]], where he faced a [[cholera]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Manolache&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===

A [[Freemasonry|Freemason]],&lt;ref&gt;Otu&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu was first elected to the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] in 1914 as a [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservative Party]] representative,&lt;ref name="Savu; Slabey Roucek, p.76"/&gt; where he oscillated between the dissident the mainstream Conservatives of [[Petre P. Carp]] and the dissident group around [[Take Ionescu]] (the latter was welcoming Romania's entry into [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]], which Argetoianu also proposed).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.251&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1918, during the final stages of the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]], Argetoianu was Justice Minister, sitting on the first [[Alexandru Averescu]] cabinet (at the time when authorities had retreated to [[Iaşi]], leaving the southern half of the country to be occupied by [[German Empire|Imperial German]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Bulgaria]]n troops).&lt;ref name="Slabey Roucek, p.76"/&gt; He was also head of the Romanian delegation at the Peace preliminaries of [[Buftea]], in 1918. The talks resulted in the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] of May, which consecrated Romania's defeat by the [[Central Powers]]. His actions at the time were later the subject of an [[epigram]] by [[Cincinat Pavelescu]] (Pavelescu expressed his belief that the treaty and Argetoianu's views on fiscal policies were to be the subject of scorn for future generations).&lt;ref&gt;Pavelescu&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Party===
Argetoianu followed Averescu into opposition to the [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) cabinet, and joined the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] (PP) created by the latter. He later documented the [[Populism|populist]] message of the movement, and left testimonies of Averescu's spontaneous adulation by the crowds of peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.264; Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit", "Mit şi realitate..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Argetoianu was Finance Minister and later [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Interior Minister]] in the second Averescu government of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Slabey Roucek, p.76; Troncotă, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1921, it was uncovered that an associate of his named Aron Schuller had attempted to contract a 20 million [[Italian lira|lire]] loan with a bank in [[Italy]], using as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] Romanian [[war bond]]s that he had illegally obtained from the Finance Ministry reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu, who was still in charge at the time, became the target of attacks from the opposition group formed by the [[Romanian National Party]] and the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]], being pressed by [[Virgil Madgearu]] and [[Grigore Iunian]] to explain himself (Iunian proposed a [[motion of no confidence]], but the PNL continued to show its support for the PP).&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p.68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clash with Communism and split with Averescu===
Argetoianu soon became noted for his [[Anti-Communism|anti-communist]] stance: he carried out arrests of those [[Socialist Party of Romania|Socialist Party]] members who, during their party's congress in May 1921, supported a [[Maximum programme|maximalist platform]] and voted in favor of aligning their Socialist-Communist faction (future [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party of Romania]]) with the [[Comintern]], citing the latter's condemnation of [[Greater Romania]] (all those arrested were prosecuted in the [[Dealul Spirii Trial]]).&lt;ref&gt;Diac; Troncotă, p.18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu later stated that the arrest lacked legal grounds, and indicated that he purposely gave the Socialist [[Gheorghe Cristescu]] approval to hold the congress as a means to incriminate the faction.&lt;ref name="Diac"&gt;Diac&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with mixed reactions inside the cabinet (Averescu hesitated, while the Minister of Justice [[Grigore Trancu-Iași]] refused to give him support), he ordered the move without his fellow ministers' prior knowledge, and thus faced them with a ''[[fait accompli]]''.&lt;ref name="Diac"/&gt;

The standoff between Averescu and the parliamentary opposition eventually witnessed a decisive incident: during a prolonged debate over Averescu's proposal to [[Nationalization|nationalize]] enterprises in [[Reşiţa]], Argetoianu addressed a mumbled insult to Madgearu; the PNL, seeing an opportunity for a return to power, expressed sympathy, and all opposition groups appealed to Ferdinand, asking for Averescu's recall (July 14, 1921).&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Prăbuşirea unui mit"&gt;Scurtu, "Prăbuşirea unui mit"&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Averescu's eventual defeat in December 1921, Argetoianu was kept in office by the [[Take Ionescu]] and Brătianu cabinets. During the spring of 1922, he ordered the killing of several Communist activists who were held in prison custody, including [[Leonte Filipescu]], staging their attempts to flee from under escort as a pretext.&lt;ref&gt;Troncotă, p.18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, pressures on the revolutionary grouping were relaxed in summer, when [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] approved an [[amnesty]] and Argetoianu officially declared that "communism is over in Romania".&lt;ref&gt;Argetoianu, in Diac; in Troncotă, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

===PND and PNL===
In 1923, after Brătianu again assumed power, he clashed with Averescu and proclaimed himself leader of the PP, being eventually expelled.&lt;ref name="Scurtu, Prăbuşirea unui mit"/&gt; Having joined [[Nicolae Iorga]]'s [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]] (PND), he soon vehemently protested against the latter's alliance with the Romanian National Party, and moved to the PNL.&lt;ref name="Slabey Roucek, p.76"/&gt;

Following the sudden death of Ion I. C. Brătianu in 1927, and choosing, in contrast to the policies of [[Dinu Brătianu]], to support the new King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] in 1930, Argetoianu left the party and subsequently defined himself as an independent.&lt;ref name="Slabey Roucek, p.76"/&gt; In effect, he moved into the camp of politicians approving of an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime around Carol.&lt;ref name="Veiga, p.130"&gt;Veiga, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; As the monarch's relations with the traditional political class were souring, Argetoianu allegedly engaged in a campaign to draw new allegiances from other environments, aiding to establish a Romanian ''[[Camarilla (history)|camarilla]]'' &amp;mdash; it was even reported that, using the official commitment to neutral [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] as a means to appoint his choice of people to positions of influence, he had recruited his fellow [[Bucharest]] [[Jockey Club of Bucharest|Jockey Club]] members.&lt;ref name="Veiga, p.130"/&gt; Among his most vocal supporters at the time was the [[far right]] philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.226; Veiga, p.200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iorga cabinet and Agrarian Party===
He was again in charge of Internal Affairs and Finance from 1931 to 1932, during the Iorga government,&lt;ref&gt;Slabey Roucek, p.76; Veiga, p.137–138&lt;/ref&gt; when he took a harsh stance against the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], outlawing it and arresting some of its members (which led to a string of violent confrontations).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.295, 296; Veiga, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu was hotly contested as Finance Minister: faced with the widespread [[insolvency]] of small agricultural holdings in front of the [[Great Depression]], he proposed a form of [[liquidation]] that was considered in breach of the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.130, 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; Various other issues forced Argetoianu to cease payments of salaries for [[Civil service|civil servants]] at certain intervals, causing far-reaching problems.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

The government was voted out of office in the elections of 1932, when Iorga was replaced by [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]], a member of the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNŢ) who was himself challenged with solving the agrarian issue;&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.138, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu subsequently founded the minor [[Agrarian Union Party]], which, after the National Liberals returned to power with [[Ion G. Duca]], remained a close associate of the king in his competition with traditional forces; when Duca was assassinated by the Iron Guard in the final days of 1933, Argetoianu, together with his former adversary, PNŢ dissident [[Grigore Iunian]], and the [[National Agrarian Party (Romania)|National Agrarian Party]]'s [[Octavian Goga]], was probably one of the king's main options in his attempt to create an altogether new political establishment around the ''camarilla'', relying on a compromise with [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] (leader of the Iron Guard).&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.202, 209, 215&lt;/ref&gt; Codreanu refused to accept negotiation, but Carol successfully approached the PNL's "young liberals" faction, which came to power with [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]] (January 1934).&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal dictatorship and World War II===
The frequent target of attacks in the Iron Guard press,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.243, 245&lt;/ref&gt; Argetoianu led his grouping until 1938, when, faced with the unstoppable rise of the Iron Guard, Carol banned all parties and established his [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN).&lt;ref&gt;Argetoianu, "Pleacă Tătărescu, vine Gigurtu"; Veiga, p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

His own short-lived FRN cabinet, established after that date, was, after [[Gheorghe Argeşanu]]'s the second in quick succession to the violent clash between the Guard and monarch (after the murder of [[Armand Călinescu]] by the former). The Argetoianu government was replaced by that of Tătărescu, who had to deal with the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia|occupation of Bessarabia]] and was in turn replaced with [[Ion Gigurtu]]&lt;ref&gt;Argetoianu, "Pleacă Tătărescu, vine Gigurtu"&lt;/ref&gt; (Argetoianu, who remained influential throughout the period, began calling for a rapprochement between Romania and the Soviets).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Otu&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol's regime crumbled after the [[Second Vienna Award]], when Romania had to cede [[Northern Transylvania]] to [[Hungary]]; it was replaced by the Iron Guard's [[National Legionary State]], which, itself repressed during the previous years, began a campaign of retaliation &amp;mdash; like Tătărescu and several others, Argetoianu was kidnapped on November 27, 1940 in the wake of the [[Jilava Massacre]], and faced assassination until being rescued by the intervention of [[Romanian Army]] officials.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p.292, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Retreating from public life during [[World War II]] and the [[Ion Antonescu]] dictatorship (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), Argetoianu left the country in the spring of 1944, settling in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Romania's withdrawal from the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and the start of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]] caused him to return in November, seeing an opportunity in the apparent decrease in the appeal of traditional parties and expanding on his vision of Romanian-Soviet cooperation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He was the subject of derision in the [[National Peasants' Party]] press (''[[Dreptatea]]'' wrote of him: "leading the intrigue in favor of a [[private property]]–based [[communism]], a [[Capitalism|capitalist]]-based [[socialism]], a [[Working class|mass]]-free [[democracy]]... The country is trustingly placing itself at your disposal. Here are your strings: pull them! Here are your back rooms: maneuver them! Here is your «people»: take it away!").&lt;ref&gt;"Profilo", in Otu&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNMR, arrest, and death===

Attempting in vain to mediate between the Communists and the PNȚ, Argetoianu was rejected by both sides, and, in January 1947, formed his own grouping &amp;mdash; the ''National Union for Work and Reconstruction'' (''Uniunea Națională Muncă și Refacere'', UNMR) &amp;mdash;, alongside [[Nicolae Ottescu]], [[Nicolae D. Cornățeanu]], [[Zamfir Brătescu]] and others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was kept under surveillance by the Communist-controlled [[Petru Groza]] government, and was infiltrated by the pro-Communist ''National-Agrarian Action'' (''Acțiunea Național-Agrară'', ANA).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The UNMR disbanded over worries that Argetoianu was losing credibility with Soviet authorities—the group around Cornățeanu joined Premier Groza's [[Ploughmen's Front]], while others entered the [[Union of Patriots (Romania)|Union of Patriots]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Argetoianu, who was ill at the time and had just undergone surgery on his [[prostate]], withdrew from public life for a second time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Two years after a [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] was imposed on Romania, on the morning of May 6, 1950, he was arrested by the [[Securitate]]; while being taken away, he was heard saying: "Man, you sure are tough, you communists, if you are afraid of a farting old man such as myself".&lt;ref&gt;Argetoianu, in Otu&lt;/ref&gt; He died in the infamous [[Sighet prison]] five years later,&lt;ref&gt;* {{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11543">'''Decision Model and Notation''' ('''DMN''') is a standard published by the [[Object Management Group]].&lt;ref name="DMNstandard"&gt;OMG standard "Decision Model and Notation (DMN)", [http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN current version]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a standard approach for describing and modeling repeatable decisions within organizations to ensure that decision models are interchangeable across organizations.

The DMN standard provides the industry with a modeling notation for decisions that will support [[decision management]] and [[business rules]]. The notation is designed to be readable by business and IT users alike.  This enables various groups to effectively collaborate in defining a [[decision model]]:
* the business people who manage and monitor the decisions,
* the [[business analyst]]s or [[functional analyst]]s who document the initial decision requirements and specify the detailed decision models and decision logic, 
* the technical [[Software developer|developer]]s responsible for the automation of systems that make the decisions.

The DMN standard can be effectively used standalone but it is also complementary to the [[BPMN]] and [[CMMN]] standards. BPMN defines a special kind of activity, the Business Rule Task, which "provides a mechanism for the process to provide input to a business rule engine and to get the output of calculations that the business rule engine might provide"&lt;ref&gt;OMG standard "BPMN", [http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/Current current version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Purchase|first1=Jan|title=Book Review: Process and Decision Modeling in BPMN/DMN|url=http://blog.luxmagi.com/2015/01/book-review-process-and-decision-modeling-in-bpmndmn/|website=Decision Management for Finance Blog|publisher=Lux Magi Ltd|accessdate=19 April 2015|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be used to show where in a BPMN process a decision defined using DMN should be used.

DMN has been made a standard for Business Analysis according to [[BABOK]] v3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=IIBA|title=A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK® Guide)|date=April 15, 2015|isbn=978-1927584026|pages=512|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision Modeling now standard for Business Analysts|url=http://jtonedm.com/2015/04/28/decision-modeling-now-standard-for-business-analysts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements of the standard ==
The standard includes three main elements
* Decision Requirements Diagrams that show how the elements of decision-making are linked into a dependency network.
* Business context for decisions such as the roles of organizations or the impact on performance metrics.
* A Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) that can be used to evaluate expressions in a decision table and other logic formats.

== Use cases ==
The standard identifies three main use cases for DMN
* Defining manual decision making
* Specifying the requirements for automated decision-making
* Representing a complete, executable model of decision-making

== Benefits ==
Using the DMN standard will improve business analysis and business process management, since
* other popular requirement management techniques such as [[BPMN]] and UML do not handle decision making
* growth of projects using business rule management systems or [[BRMS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Stephanie|title=Business rules management: Tools, techniques for success|url=http://www.ebizq.net/topics/business_rules_management/features/13351.html|website=ebizq.net, The Insider's Guide to Next-Generation BPM|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allow faster changes&lt;ref&gt;Discovering the Decisions within Your Business Processes using IBM Blueworks Live, [https://books.google.be/books?id=OhzCAgAAQBAJ Publisher IBM Redbooks, 2014] {{ISBN|0738453579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* it facilitates better communications between business, IT and analytic roles in a company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ronen|first1=Gil|last2=Feldman|first2=Jacob|title=Decision models using dmn and bpmn standards: mortgage recommender|url=http://www.slideshare.net/gilnyc/decision-models-using-dmn-bpmn-standards-mortgage-recommender?related=2|website=Slideshare|publisher=OpenRules}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* it provides an effective requirements modeling approach for [[Predictive Analytics]] projects and fulfills the need for "business understanding" in methodologies for advanced analytics such as [[CRISP-DM]]
* it provides a standard notation for decision tables, the most common style of [[business rules]] in a [[BRMS]]

== Relationship to BPMN ==

DMN has been designed to work with [[BPMN]]. [[Business process model]]s can be simplified by moving process logic into decision services. DMN is a separate domain within the OMG that provides an explicit way to connect to processes in BPMN. Decisions in DMN can be explicitly linked to processes and tasks that use the decisions. DMN expects that the logic of a decision will be deployed as a stateless, side-effect free Decision Service. Such a service can be invoked from a business process and the data in the process can be mapped to the inputs and outputs of the decision service.

== DMN BPMN example ==
As mentioned, [[BPMN]] is a related [[Object Management Group#OMG Standards|OMG Standard]] for process modeling. DMN complements [[BPMN]], providing a separation of concerns between the decision and the process. The example here describes a BPMN process and DMN DRD (Decision Requirements Diagram) for onboarding a bank customer. Several decisions are modeled and these decisions will direct the processes response.

===New bank account process===
In the BPMN process model shown in the figure, a customer makes a request to open a new bank account. The account application provides the account representative with all the information needed to create an account and provide the requested services. This includes the name, address and various forms of identification. In the next steps of the work flow, the 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) services are called. 
In the 'KYC' services, the name and address are validated; followed by a check against the international criminal database (Interpol) and the database of persons that are 'Politically exposed persons ([[Politically exposed person|PEP]])'.  The PEP is a person who is either entrusted with a prominent political position or a close relative thereof. Deposits from persons on the PEP list are potentially corrupt. This is shown as two services on the process model. Anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations require these checks before the customer account is certified. 
[[File:DMN_NewBankAccountProcess_BPMN.jpg|thumbnail|Figure: A process with decisions for creating a new bank customer.]]

The results of these services plus the forms of identification are sent to the Certify New Account decision. This is shown as a 'rule' activity, verify account, on the process diagram. If the new customer passes certification, then the account is classified into onboarding for Business Retail, Retail, Wealth Management and High Value Business. Otherwise the customer application is declined. The Classify New Customer Decision classifies the customer.
If the verify-account process returns a result of 'Manual' then the PEP or the Interpol check returned a close match. The account representative must visually inspect the name and the application to determine if the match is valid and accept or decline the application.

===Certify new account decision===
[[File:DMNCertifyNewA_DRG.jpg|thumbnail|The decision structure logic and data associated with the account verification.]]

An account is certified for opening if the individual's' address is verified, that valid identification is provided, and that the applicant is not on a list of criminals or politically exposed persons. These are shown as sub-decisions below the 'certify new account' decision.The account verification services provides a 100% match of the applicants address.
For identification to be valid, the customer must provide a driver's license, passport or government issued ID.

The checks against PEP and Interpol are 'Fuzzy' matches and return matching score values.  Scores above 85 are considered a 'match' and scores between 65 and 85 would require a 'manual' screening process. People who match either of these lists are rejected by the account application process.  If there is a partial match with a score between 65 and 85, against the Interpol or PEP list then the certification is set to manual and an account representative performs a manual verification of the applicant's data. These rules are reflected in the figure below, which presents the decision table for whether to pass the provided name for the lists checks.
[[File:DMN_pass_excluded_names_table_cropped.png|thumbnail|Business rules for evaluating the score of the PEP and Interpol 'Fuzzy' match.]]

===Client category===
The client's on-boarding process is driven by what category they fall in. The category is decided by the:
* Type of client, business or private 
* The size of the funds on deposit 
* And the estimated net worth 
This decision is shown below:
[[File:DMN_client_category_DRG.jpg|thumbnail|The client category decision.]]
There are 6 business rules that determine the client's category and these are shown in the decision table here:
[[File:DMN_client_category_table.jpg|thumbnail|A DMN decision table with business rules for classifying a customer into a category based on the input data.]]

===Summary example===
In this example, the outcome of the 'Verify Account' decision directed the responses of the new account process. The same is true for the 'Classify Customer' decision. By adding or changing the business rules in the tables, one can easily change the criteria for these decisions and control the process differently.

Modeling is a critical aspect of improving an existing process or business challenge. Modeling is generally done by a team of business analysts, IT personnel, and modeling experts. The expressive modeling capabilities of BPMN allows business analyst to understand the functions of the activities of the process. Now with the addition of DMN, business analysts can construct an understandable model of complex decisions. Combining BPMN and DMN yields a very powerful combination of models that work synergistically to simplify processes.

'''Dimitris Kontominas''' ({{lang-el|Δημήτρης Κοντομηνάς}}); born 1939) is a Greek businessman who is active in insurance, television, cinema and retail trade. He has one daughter and two grandchildren.

==Early life==

He was born on June 3, 1939 in [[Athens]]. He studied at the [[American University of Beirut]]. Initially he worked as insurer in ''American Life (ALICO)''. In 1969, he cofounded with Alexander Tampoura the insurance company ''Interamerican''.&lt;ref name=Interamerican&gt;{{cite web|title=Founding of interamerican|url=http://www.interamerican.gr/?pid=10&amp;la=2|website=Interamerican}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interamerican now belongs to Eureko BV. Kontominas remained chairman until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.invgr.com/interamerican_Kontpminas_eureko_divorce.htm |title=INVgr / Dimitris Kontpminas steps down as Chairman of Interamerican, to sell 3.3% of Eureko |work=invgr.com }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kontominas owns Prime Insurance and MyDirect insurers. He founded or acquired other companies, including:
* ''Interbank'' (later acquired and absorbed by Eurobank)
* ''Intertech''&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite web|title=Intertech Officer from reuters|url=http://in.reuters.com/finance/stocks/officerProfile?symbol=ITTr.AT&amp;officerId=926761}}&lt;/ref&gt; (exclusive representative products ''Panasonic'')
* Euroclinic Athens
* ''Novabank (in'' 2006 renamed ''Millennium Bank'') 
* ''InterJet'' – aircraft and helicopter fleet
* ''GreenFarm''
* ''FC Aris''
* [[Alpha TV]] and radio station ''Alpha 98.9'' (66% held by January 2012, the German group RTL)
* ''Village Roadshow Greece'' theaters
* Athens/Thessaloniki Channel 9 and radio station ''Alpha 96.5 Radio'' in Thessaloniki

In 2012 Kontominas took back the shares of Alpha TV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csridentity.com/luxembourg/rtlgroup.asp |title=RTL Group |work=csridentity.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118041541/http://csridentity.com/luxembourg/rtlgroup.asp |archivedate=November 18, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; when RTL Group decided to exit. In 2015 Alpha TV was the number one Greek TV station.

Kontpminas is the president of DEMCO GROUP, one of Greece's largest investment holding companies. It has a diversified portfolio, with holdings in media, financial services, entertainment, IT and telecom, leisure and Entertainment and Food &amp; Beverages. Within its companies' portfolio one can find Village Group (Cinema and films), Alpha TV and Alpha Radio, Intertech (Panasonic's exclusive representative in Greece), Prime Insurance, myDirect online insurance, ''Sportday'' newspaper and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demco.gr/|title=home|work=demco.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a little time in the early 2000s was owner of [[Aris F.C.]].

He declared "Great Protekdikos Archon of the Ecumenical Throne"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ec-patr.org/gr/offik/List.htm | title=Ονομαστικός Κατάλογος των Αρχόντων Οφφικιάλων της Μεγάλης του Χριστού Εκκλησίας}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and "Great Benefactor" from Metropolis of Chalcedon.Aris F.C.

He was arrested in 2014. According to the authorities approximately 200 million euros worth of loans were issued by the bank during the period in question to companies controlled by certain well-connected businessmen without guarantees, none of which have been repaid. The case is also linked to another financial scandal involving another 300&amp;nbsp;million worth of losses due to bad loans made to a property developer. The accused face charges including fraud, money laundering and complicity in malpractice. An extremely scandalous man, no one refers to the money he stole from Greeks living abroad while he was owner of Interamerican. The story hit the media in 2004 by a rivalry channel Alter owned by Nikos Kouris. The channel does not exist anymore and the Interamerican Scandal is nowhere to be mentioned.

'''Dominik Florian Brunner''' (born 18 May 1959 in [[Stuttgart]], died 12 September 2009 in [[Munich]]) was a [[Germany|German]] businessman. He was the CFO of Erlus AG, Germany’s largest [[roof tile]] manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/world-news/2009/09/16/munich-s-bahn-train-death/killer-teen-gang-let-go-six-days-before-attack.html|author1=J.

Steinbach |title=Killer teen S-Bahn gang were let go six days before deadly attack|date=2009-09-16|work=bild.de|accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed in a fight which resulted from Brunner trying to protect a group of school children from attacks by teenagers.

==Biography==
Brunner was born to a family of entrepreneurs. His father, Oscar Brunner, was the finance manager of one of Germany's largest roof tile manufacturers, Erlus AG. After receiving his [[Abitur]] in [[Landshut]], Brunner studied law at the [[University of Munich]] and worked in office positions in [[San Francisco]] and Paris. He followed in his father's footsteps when he took a leading position at Erlus AG. His fields of responsibility included finance, organization, personnel, law and purchases.

In the 1990s, Brunner trained in [[kickboxing]] at Boxclub Straubing, but gave up the hobby after
he noticed more and more young men arriving at the club to learn how to beat others.&lt;ref name=diezeit&gt;Claudia Keller, [http://www.zeit.de/politik/2010-07/schlag-auf-schlag-70092?page=all "Das Heldenbild Brunner wird unheimlich"], ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 12 July 2010, retrieved 1 November 2012 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 12 September 2009, four school children were being threatened on a [[Munich S-Bahn]] train by two older teenagers, Markus Schiller and Sebastian Leibinger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0714/1224274660976.html|title=Youths on trial for killing 'Samaritan'|author=Derek Scally|date=14 July 2010|work=[[Irish Times]]|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who tried to rob and mug them. When Brunner and the young teens arrived at [[München Solln station]], Brunner was punched and kicked over 20 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/lost_in_berlin/2009/09/20/death_of_a_hero_the_murder_of_dominik_brunner|title=Death of a hero: The murder of Dominik Brunner|date=2009-09-20|author=Alan Nothnagle|work=Lost in Berlin, Open Salon blog|publisher=salon.com|accessdate=2009-10-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007142929/http://open.salon.com/blog/lost_in_berlin/2009/09/20/death_of_a_hero_the_murder_of_dominik_brunner|archivedate=2009-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually died on-site due to a pre-existing heart condition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/0,1518,707012,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiller and Leibinger were charged with murder.&lt;ref name=diezeit/&gt; In the court case, it was proven that Brunner became involved with the aim of protecting the school children, but questions were raised as to whether he died due to the brutal beating by the accused, and there were differing versions of how the fight between Brunner and the accused started.&lt;ref name=diezeit2/&gt; When the accused were threatening the children, Brunner asked them to stop, or he would call the police. The accused did not listen, so Brunner informed the police. He then asked the children to "stay away", took up a combat position and started to hit and fight the accused. However, according to another witness, Brunner approached the accused, shouted "this is what you want", and then hit Markus Schiller in the face. Although he was described as a hero in early media reports, there was discussion later regarding how much blame for starting the fight lies with Brunner himself.&lt;ref name=diezeit2&gt;Miriam Hollstein, [https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/weltgeschehen/article8509029/Ist-Dominik-Brunner-jetzt-noch-ein-Held.html "Ist Dominik Brunner jetzt noch ein Held?"] ''Die Welt'', 18 July 2012, retrieved 1 November 2012 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court pronounced judgement on 6 September 2010: Schiller, who had by then turned 19, was sentenced to 9 years and 10 months in a youth facility as a primary accomplice in an attempted robbery with violence leading to murder; Leibinger was sentenced to 7 years in a youth facility as a primary accomplice in an attempted robbery with violence leading to grievous bodily harm resulting in death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justiz.bayern.de/gericht/olg/m/presse/archiv/2010/02740/ Strafverfahren gegen Markus S. und Sebastian L. wegen Mordes u. a.

A '''facilitating payment''' is a certain type of payment to foreign officials that is not considered to be [[bribery]] according to [[legislation]]s of some states as well as in the international anti-bribery conventions, e.g., coming from the [[OECD]].

==Dangers==
For legal purposes, it is distinguished from [[bribery]], however the distinction is often blurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/business/opinion/is-facilitating-payment-a-bribe-or-not-758043 "Is 'facilitating payment' a bribe or not?"], ''Business Report'', September 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Determining whether a payment is a facilitating one may be difficult and depend on the circumstances. The value of the payment is not immediately relevant, however the greater the value, the higher are chances that it will be a [[red flag (signal)|red flag]] for law enforcement. Small unofficial payments are customary and even legal in some countries, nevertheless they may present a risk of liability according to the laws of the host country. There also exists a [[slippery slope]] danger of evolving into dubious payments.&lt;ref name=deming/&gt;

==Business ethics==
While being legal, facilitating payments are still considered to be questionable from the point of view of [[business ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Argandoña|first1=Antonio|title=Corruption and Companies: The Use of Facilitating Payments|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=September 2005|volume=60|issue=3|pages=251–264|doi=10.1007/s10551-005-0133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailes, Robert (2006). Facilitation Payments: Culturally Acceptable or Unacceptable Corrupt? ''[[Business Ethics: A European Review]]'', 15(3), 293-298.&lt;/ref&gt; The following arguments have been made:
*[[Unfair competition]]: smaller business have fewer opportunities and less financial possibilities to "grease" foreign officials.
*sustaining questionable business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rdoger|first1=Raliigh|title=Ways to improve international business payment solutions|url=http://www.transferguru.com/blog/9-ways-improve-your-international-business-payment-solutions/|website=www.transferguru.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*dependence on irregular payments creates additional risk and hence discourages investment&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

Many companies therefore restrict or severely limit making facilitating payments in their policies, however this practice is not yet widespread. For example, {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, in [[Australia]], among the [[S&amp;P ASX 100]] only 24 companies control facilitating payments and only 15 are reported to prohibit them.&lt;ref name=walters&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/management-companies-enterprises/1188858-1.html "Just how is business done? A review of Australian business's approach to bribery and corruption"], by Julie Walters, ''Keeping Good Companies'',  July 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development==
[[OECD]] defines a payment to be a facilitating one if it is paid to government employees to speed up an administrative process where the outcome is already pre-determined.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

==By country==
===Australia===
{{As of|2006}}, the [[Australia]]n law has discrepancies as to the definition of the facilitating payment.

The Criminal Code defines a facilitating payment to be a payment which is &lt;ref name=walters/&gt;
* of a nominal value (the term is not defined in the Code)
* paid to a foreign official for the sole or predominant purpose of expediting a minor routine action, and
* documented as soon as possible.

The  [[Income Tax Assessment Act]] as amended in 1999 permit companies claim facilitation payments as deductions (before 1999 bribes were also valid deductions), but its definition does not refer to the size of the payment.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

Many Australian states override the federal legislation and define facilitating payments as illegal.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia this phrase (in English) means payment to a bureaucrat when he does off-job extra work for a private entity by helping deal with his ministry. It is generally unclear whether it has a part of corruption in it. It was generally considered legal, until economy minister [[Ulyukaev]] received 8 years jail for it. After this case, Russian bureaucrats are reported to heavily refrain from this practice.

===United Kingdom===
{{As of|2010}}, subsequent to the Bribery Act, the [[United Kingdom]] does not recognize the legality of facilitating payments and does not draw any distinction from bribes. However the OECD notes that the UK is unlikely to prosecute for minor facilitating payments in the areas where it is a common practice. The Ministry of Justice guidance, however, confirms that prosecutors will exercise discretion in determining whether to prosecute. In addition, informal guidance received from the SFO indicate that where it is considering action, it will be guided by the following six principles:
* Whether the company has a clear and issued policy.
* Whether the company has written guidance available to employees as to the procedures they must follow where a facilitation payment is requested or expected.
* Whether such procedures are really being followed (monitoring).
* Evidence that gifts are being recorded at the company.
* Proper action, collective or otherwise, to inform the appropriate authorities in countries when a breach of the policy occurs.
* The company is taking what practical steps it can to curtail such payments.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

===United States===
Within the [[United States federal legislation]], a '''facilitating payment''' or '''"grease payment"''', as defined by the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) of 1977 and clarified in its 1988 amendments, is a payment to a foreign official, political party or party official for "routine governmental action", such as processing papers, issuing permits, and other actions of an official, in order to expedite performance of duties of non-discretionary nature, i.e., which they are already bound to perform. The payment is not intended to influence the outcome of the official's action, only its timing.&lt;ref name=deming&gt;Stuart H. Deming (2005)  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act And the New International Norms",   American Bar Association, {{ISBN|1-59031-326-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITG208fCRvcC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22facilitating+payment%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=aAgWUfUiD4&amp;sig=2zCEc0NNJwgL-GSgPosF0xCxJTU p.15]&lt;/ref&gt; Facilitation payments are one of the few exceptions from anti-[[bribery]] prohibitions of the law.

==Evolution of the notion==
Prior to the 1988 amendments, the exclusion of "grease payments" was via the definition of the "foreign official", which did not include persons without discretionary (decision-making) duties, e.g., ones with clerical functions. The major drawback of this approach is that often it is difficult to properly identify the scope of duties of a foreign official. The 1988 amendment eliminated this drawback by placing the emphasis on the purpose of the payment rather than on the duties of the recipient. At the same time the scope of the "routine governmental actions" in question was made sufficiently narrow and supplied with detailed examples.&lt;ref&gt;Don Zarin (1995) "Doing Business Under The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act",  Practising Law Institute {{ISBN|0-87224-087-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bv8jACUiP74C&amp;pg=PT4&amp;vq=facilitating&amp;dq=%22facilitating+payment%22&amp;sig=WLtZd_725SOmPExCTH8MP-fRvMs#PPT114,M1  $5.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harkness Tower''' is a [[masonry]] [[tower]] at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. Part of the [[Collegiate Gothic]] [[Memorial Quadrangle]] complex completed in 1922, it is named for [[Charles William Harkness]], brother of Yale's largest benefactor, [[Edward Harkness]].

==History==
[[File:Harkness Tower in Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn.jpg|thumb|left|Harkness Tower over the year]]
The tower was constructed between 1917 and 1921 as part of the [[Memorial Quadrangle]] donated to Yale by [[Anna M. Harkness]] in honor of her recently deceased son, [[Charles William Harkness]], an 1883 Yale graduate.&lt;ref name="Yamasaki"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yamasaki |first=Tritia |title=The Character of Harkness Tower |url=http://www.yale.edu/carillon/yamasaki.htm |accessdate=3 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109052100/http://www.yale.edu/carillon/yamasaki.htm |archivedate=9 November 2000 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Residential colleges of Yale University|residential college system]] was inaugurated in 1933, the tower became part of [[Branford College]].

It was designed by [[James Gamble Rogers]], a [[Yale College]] classmate of Anna Harkness's other son, [[Edward S. Harkness]]. James S. Hedden was the contractor's supervisor for the project and took many photographs of the construction's progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hedden |first=James S. |title=Guide to the Photographs of Memorial Quadrangle, Yale University |url=http://mssa.library.yale.edu/findaids/eadPDF/mssa.ru.0631.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627122200/http://mssa.library.yale.edu/findaids/eadPDF/mssa.ru.0631.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tower underwent renovations from September 2009 to May 2010 to repair its masonry and ornament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Arnsdorf |first=Isaac |title=Renovations Underway at Harkness Tower |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=20 August 2009 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2009/08/20/renovations-underway-at-harkness-tower/ |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Harkness Tower was the first ''couronne'' ("crown") tower in [[Gothic architecture|English Perpendicular Gothic style]] built in the modern era.&lt;ref name=Yamasaki /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Stanley T. |title=The Harkness Memorial Tower |date=26 October 1921 |journal=American Architect |volume=120 |issue=9 |pages=315–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Gamble Rogers]], who designed the tower and many of Yale's [[Collegiate Gothic]] structures, said it was inspired by the 15th-century [[Boston Stump]], the {{convert|272|ft|m|adj=on}} tower of the parish church of [[St Botolph]] in [[Boston, Lincolnshire]]&lt;ref name=Yamasaki /&gt; and tallest parish church tower in [[England]]. Rogers also based some details on the 16th-century tower of [[St Giles' Church, Wrexham|St Giles church]] in [[Wrexham]], [[Wales]], where [[Elihu Yale]] is buried. In turn, Harkness Tower has been identified as the direct influence for the tower of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Christ the King (Hamilton)|Cathedral of Christ the King]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wubbenhorst |first=Paula |title=America's Influence on the Cathedral of Christ the King in Hamilton |journal=Journal of the Society for the Study of Architecture in Canada |volume=29 |issue=3,4 |date=2004 |pages=41–50 |url=http://sextondigital.library.dal.ca/jssac/PDFs/Journal/Vol_29/vol29_no3-4_OCR_150dpi_PDFA1b.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071154/http://sextondigital.library.dal.ca/jssac/PDFs/Journal/Vol_29/vol29_no3-4_OCR_150dpi_PDFA1b.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tower's image was adopted by the ''[[Yale Herald]]'', a weekly student newspaper, for its masthead.

==Design==
[[Image:Harkness Tower, high contrast.jpg|thumb|The bronze clock faces on the Tower]]
Harkness Tower is 216 feet (66&amp;nbsp;m) tall, one foot for each year since Yale's founding at the time it was built. From a square base, it rises in stages to a double stone crown on an octagonal base, and at the top are stone [[finial]]s. From the street level to the roof, there are 284 steps.

Midway to the top, four openwork copper clockfaces tell the hours. The bells of the carillon are behind the clockfaces, fixed to a frame made of steel [[I-beam]]s. The playing console of the carillon is at the level of the balconies immediately below the clock faces. Lower levels of the tower house a water tank (no longer used), two practice carillons, the old chimes playing console, office space for the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs, and a memorial chapel.

===Materials===
The tower was built of separate stone blocks, and reinforced with steel in 1966 to handle the new bells in the carillon.

{{Original research|paragraph|date=October 2017}}
Yale tour guides frequently mention the legend that the tower was the world's tallest free-standing stone structure until it required reinforcement after an eccentric architect or philanthropist ordered acid to be poured down the walls to make it look older.  In reality, the [[Washington Monument]] was the country's tallest such structure long before Harkness Tower was built.

===Ornamentation===
The towers's decorative elements were sculpted by [[Lee Lawrie]]. The lowest level of [[sculpture]] depicts Yale's ''Eight Worthies'': [[Elihu Yale]], [[Jonathan Edwards (theology)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Nathan Hale]], [[Noah Webster]], [[James Fenimore Cooper]], [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Samuel F. B. Morse]], and [[Eli Whitney]]. The second level of sculpture depicts [[Phidias]], [[Homer]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Euclid]]. The next level of [[sculpture]] consists of allegorical figures depicting [[Medicine]], [[Business]], [[Law]], [[Christian Church|the Church]], Courage and Effort, War and Peace, Generosity and Order, Justice and Truth, Life and Progress, and Death and Freedom. The [[gargoyle]]s on the top level depict Yale's students at war and in study (a pen-wielding writer, a proficient athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a diligent scholar), along with masks of [[Homer]], [[Virgil]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

==Reception==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2017}}
The witticism, attributed to various modernist architects, that had they to choose any place in [[New Haven]] to live s/he would select the Harkness Tower, for then they "would not have to look at it," is apparently apocryphal, derivative of a similar story told of [[Guy de Maupassant]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]].

==Carillon==
{{main|Yale Memorial Carillon}}
[[Image:YaleCarillonConsole.jpg|thumb|left|The console from which the [[Yale Memorial Carillon]] is played.]]
The tower contains the [[Yale Memorial Carillon]], a 54-bell [[carillon]]. It is a transposing instrument; the C bell sounds a concert B. Ten bells were installed in 1922 and 44 added in 1966. The instrument is played by members of a student-run group set up for the purpose, the [[Yale Guild of Carillonneurs]], and selected guest carillonneurs. During the school year, the instrument is played twice per day: a half-hour session at 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and a one-hour session at 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Some residents of [[Branford College]] and [[Saybrook College]]&lt;nowiki&gt;, of which the tower forms a part of the periphery, have been known to refer to the daily performances as "Heavy Metal.")&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Citation needed|reason="have been known to" is fishy, and unsourced|date=July 2013}} In summer it is played only in the evening, plus a summer series of Friday concerts. Carillon play was suspended in 2009 and 2010 during the tower's renovation.

'''''Hysteria Hospital: Emergency Ward''''' is a [[casual game|casual video game]] published by [[O-Games]] on June 16, 2009 in North America. The game is a simulation/strategy that bears a striking resemblance to the popular [[Diner Dash]] franchise.

==Gameplay==
Hysteria Hospital tasks users with coordinating the management of a hospital. The goal of the game is to accumulate money over time by serving patients. Users can purchase new equipment such as X-Ray machines to meet the demands of their patients. Main gameplay elements involve diagnosing patients, and moving them to the applicable local facilities if available (or the ambulance to get sent elsewhere). Patients are moved by dragging them to different areas. A nurse is controllable by clicking on objects, and performs chores such as fetching prescriptions, making beds and cleaning waste.

'''Jakob Heilmann''' (21 August 1846 in [[Geiselbach]], [[Aschaffenburg County]] ([[Lower Franconia]]) – 15 February 1927 in [[Munich]]) was a German [[general contractor|contractor]].

Son of a glazier, Heilmann attended the construction school in Munich and graduated with the exam as a master builder.
 
Since 1866, he was into railway construction and in 1871 established the builders J. Heilmann in Regensburg. In 1892, his son-in-law, the young architect Professor [[Max Littmann]] (1862-1931) joined him, so the construction company of [[Heilmann &amp; Littmann]] KG (after 1897 GmbH) came into existence. The real estate business was taken care by the [[Heilmann'sche Immobilien-Gesellschaft AG]] and several other related companies.

Heilmann engaged mostly in the building of family homes and mansions, among others in Munich Gern and in Solln-Prinz-Ludwigshöhe.

Magnificent and monumental buildings included the [[Schackgalerie]], the [[Prinzregententheater]], [[Süddeutscher Verlag|Münchener Neueste Nachrichten]], [[Hofbräuhaus]]-rebuilding in Munich and several health resort hotels in other parts of Bavaria.

After the partners Littmann and [[Richard Reverdy]] left in 1908 und 1909, his sons [[Albert Heilmann|Albert]] and [[Otto Heilmann|Otto]] joined the construction company..

Furthermore, Jakob Heilmann initiated the founding of the electric power provider [[Isarwerke]] GmbH.

== Biography ==
Born in [[Maryland]] to Thomas Francis Griffith and Euphemia Hill, Griffith came into prominence in the 1900s. Early 1900s had joined the International Accountants' Society, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Accountants and Book-keepers, International Association of Office Men (1907). ''Business, the Magazine for Office, Store and Factory.'' p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; a home study school founded in 1903 in Chicago. There he was director of the Course in Systematizing,&lt;ref&gt;[[Arch Wilkinson Shaw]]. ''The Magazine of Business,'' A. W. Shaw Company, Vol. 7 (1905), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; and published his first book on systematizing in 1905. Earlier in the 1900s he had published a series of articles in ''The Life Insurance Independent and American Journal of Life Insurance,''&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, James Bray. "A card system for the solicitor," in: ''The Life Insurance Independent and American Journal of Life Insurance,'' Vol. 15-16 (1903), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, James Bray. "Some suggestions for the accounting department," in: ''The Life Insurance Independent and American Journal of Life Insurance,'' Vol. 15-16 (1903), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, James Bray. "A modern filling system," in: ''The Life Insurance Independent and American Journal of Life Insurance,'' Vol. 15-16 (1903), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; and in McGraw Hill's ''The Magazine of Business.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Arch Wilkinson Shaw]]. ''The Magazine of Business,'' A. W. Shaw Company, 1904. Vol. 5. p. 312, 412, 508&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Griffith. "A Card System for Building and Loan Associations," in: ''The Magazine of business,'' Vol. 6  (1904), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:American School of Correspondence.jpg|thumb|Head office of American School of Correspondence, 1912]]
Later in the 1900s Griffith joined the [[American School of Correspondence]], a distance education high school founded in 1897. For the Department of Commerce, Accountancy, and Business Administration Griffith wrote a series of instruction papers, among others on ''Advertising &amp; Sales Organization'' (1909), ''Purchasing and stores department'' (1909), ''Records of labor and manufacturing orders'' (1909), ''Theory of Accounts'' (1914).&lt;ref name="WES 1975"&gt;Stone, Williard E. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40697359 Who Was Who in Accounting in 1909?]." ''The Accounting Historians Journal'' (1975): 6-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith was head of the Department of Commerce, Accountancy, and Business Administration until the late 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;American Technical Society (1920) ''Accountancy and Business Management.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Accounting Historians Journal,'' Vol. 1-3 (1981), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 Griffith was Managing Editor of the ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,'' a general reference work on accounting, auditing, bookkeeping, commercial law, business management, administrative and industrial organization, banking, advertising, selling, office and factory records, cost keeping, systematizing, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Accountants' Index: A Bibliography of Accounting.'' (1921), p. 860.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darrell D. Dorrell, Gregory A. Gadawski (2012) ''Financial Forensics Body of Knowledge.'' p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== ''Systematizing,'' 1905 ===
[[File:Systematizing, 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|Systematizing, 1905]]
In the 1905 Griffith published his first work, entitled ''Systematizing.'' A 1907 review explained, that the demand for trained systematizers - men who have learned the science of business organization - is far greater that the supply. Such men experience no difficulty in securing lucrative positions, while those who engage in the work professionally soon attract as many clients as they can successfully serve.&lt;ref name="NAAB 1908"&gt;National Association of Accountants and Book-keepers, International Association of Office Men (1907) ''Business, the Magazine for Office, Store and Factory.'' (1908) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the review claimed that systematizing can be learned by means of the ''course'' in ''systematizing'' under personal direction of J.B. Griffith, who with the assistance of some experts, perfected the only practical plan of teaching systematizing and business organization offered by any institution. No other educational organization is prepared to offer such thorough instruction in the subjects embraced in this course. Like other business subjects, the only practical way to learn systematizing is by actual practice — actually systematizing a business - and that explains the success of the course.&lt;ref name="NAAB 1908"/&gt;

=== The system concept ===
In the 1905 ''Systematizing'' Griffith (1905) opened with stating that, before we can intelligently take up the study of [[system]], we must first consider what the term means. According to Griffith, the term system as applied to business is: 
* the plan under which the work of the entire business is carried on; 
* the plan for conducting each department and for taking care of every detail; 
* the method of recording the various transactions of the business and collecting information in such form that as will most clearly exhibit the condition of any department.&lt;ref name="B 1905 3-4"&gt;Bray (1905, p. 3-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith continued that, the key note of system is [[economy]]. A perfect system handles the details in a given department with the least possible labor. It unites the plan for handling these details into a harmonious whole for the quick and economical conduct of that particular department. The systems for conducting the various departments must in turn be united into a plan for the operation of the entire concern.&lt;ref name="B 1905 3-4"/&gt;

The result, according to Griffith, is a thoroughly systematized business—a complete machine—in which every department is operated and each detail handled without friction and with the smallest possible expenditure if time labour and expense.&lt;ref name="B 1905 3-4"/&gt;

=== Graphic illustration of the organization ===
[[File:Chart of Business Organization, 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|Chart of Organization]]
A really systematic organization, according to Griffith (1905), is one in which all of the departments work in harmony; in which every person in the establishment for the Executive head down, conforms to and performs his part of the work according to the system laid down. As applied to business concerns, the idea is best illustrated by a chart.&lt;ref name="B 1905 14-16"&gt;Bray (1905, p. 14-16)&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith explained:

{{quote|At the center of the organization is the executive with whom communication is established by those subordinates from whom he received reports and to whom he issues orders. From them the lines of communication lead directly to those in charge of the various departments under them and then on down to every employe.

While the illustration applies to a given class of concerns, this chart will give a very clear idea of how any business can be organized. If it be a jobbing business, the manufacturing departments would be omitted from the chart. In laying out the chart of any given concern it is necessary to carefully study every existing condition and the requirements of the business. Make the chart fit the business instead of trying to fit the business to a chart designed for some other concern.&lt;ref name="B 1905 14-16"/&gt;}}

At the end of the first chapter a chart is presented of a business organization (see image), which has similarities with both an [[organizational chart]] and [[mind map]]. The charts building blocks mention both business function (executive), departments (Mfg. Dept.; Selling Dept.; Accounting Dept.; etc.), records (Purchase Records; Sales Ledger; etc.), business activities (Time Keeping; Cost Accounting; etc.), and cost accounting classes (Labour Direct; Labour Indirect; etc.). In a similar way organization departments had been pictured by Griffith, such as the Purchasing Department, Stock Department and Advertising Department (see below).

&lt;gallery caption="Charts of organization departments, 1905" widths=180 heights=300 class=center&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Chart of Duties, Responsibilities and Authorities of Department Heads, 1909.jpg|thumb|Chart of Duties, Responsibilities and Authorities of 
Department Heads, 1909]]
The presentation of these kind of preliminary organizational charts was rather rare in those days. The work itself has similarities with the series of system charts, [[Horace Lucian Arnold]] had published two years earlier in his 1903 ''The Factory manager and accountant.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold, Horace L.]] (1903). ''The Factory manager and accountant, some examples of the latest American factory practice; collected and arranged by Horace Lucian Arnold (Henry Roland).'' The Engineering Magazine company. p. 317-332.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is remarkable, that these diagrams were also not republished in Griffith's later works. Griffith did develop the concept into a single chart of the Duties, Responsibilities and Authorities of Department Heads (see image), which was first published in Griffith's ''Administrative and industrial organization'' (1909), and republished in the 1910 ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,''&lt;ref&gt;''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,'' (1910) Vol 4, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these efforts to introduce these visual aids, they didn't become that popular yet. In the 1920s a survey revealed that organizational charts were still not common among ordinary business concerns, but they were beginning to find their way into administrative and business enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Hamilton institute]] (1923) ''[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.35128001192606 Organization charts].'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charting factory layout and routing ===
Another feature Griffith demonstrated in his work ''Systematizing'' and later works is the charting of factory layout and routing. In ''Systematizing'' he gave one example in the third section about "The Stock Department,"  where as example he illustrated two arrangements, or [[routing diagram]]s, for handling lumber:
 
&lt;gallery caption="Arrangement for handling lumber, 1905" widths= 240 heights=300 class=center&gt;
File:Arrangement for handling lumber (1), 1905.jpg |alt=Arrangement for handling lumber (I) |I: Arrangement for handling lumber
File:Arrangement for handling lumber (2), 1905.jpg |alt=Arrangement for handling lumber (II)|II: Arrangement for handling lumber
&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Layout and Routing of a Typical Manufacturing Plant, 1909.jpg|thumb|420px|III: Layout and Routing of a Typical Manufacturing Plant, 1909]]
Griffith explained, that the arrangement of the stock should be such that all unnecessary handling will be avoided. The references in Section Whether it be the store house of a country store or the supply room of an immense factory, the stock most often required should be placed where it can be readily removed, while that seldom called for may be stored in the more inaccessible corners. Where the concern is large enough to require several storage places, these storage places for the different classes of stock should be located with special reference to the departments in which the stock is used.&lt;ref name="G 1905 73-74"&gt;Griffith (1905, p. 73-74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose the location of lumber yard, dry kiln, lumber shed and factory to be such as shown in Fig. I. Note How the lumber must travel back and forth, crossing the same space three times. Compare this with the arrangement shown in Fig. II.The lumber is taken the shortest possible distance and never goes over the same ground twice. Where buildings have been permanently located it may not be possible to change the general plan, but improvements can be made in nearly all cases. Take the plan in Fig. I: If the lumber yard was located immediately back of the dry kiln, at least 25 per cent of the labor of handling the lumber would be saved. The plans which we have shown illustrate examples of good and bad system in the location of one class of stock.&lt;ref name="G 1905 73-74"/&gt;

The layout and routing of a typical manufacturing plant are often more complex, see for example figure III, but the principles remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;Griffth (1909, p. 37)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- 
=== Charting business procedures and business processes ===
--&gt;

=== Documenting Policies and Procedures ===
In ''Systematizing'' Griffith showed to be a proponent of documenting policies and procedures. He argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As to the form that an order should take, the only satisfactory form is the written order ... If the request is in writing neither [the sender nor the recipient] is obliged to depend on his memory. The written order removes all chance of dispute as to its conditions, neither can there be a question of the authority of an order which bears the signature of the head of a department ... Another great advantage of the written order is that the head of a department may keep copies and follow-up each order to see that it is properly executed.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1905, p. 19-20); as cited in: [[Yates, JoAnne]], ''[https://archive.org/stream/creatingorganiza00yate Creating organizational memory : systematic management and internal communication in manufacturing firms, 1880-1920]'' Cambridge, Mass. : Sloan School of Management. 1988. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[JoAnne Yates|Yates]] (1988) commented that "the written order, whether to an individual or to the whole company, became part of organizational memory rather than just individual memory. It was then available for whatever future needs might arise."&lt;ref&gt;Yates (1988, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manufacturing Costs === 
[[File:Chart of Manufacturing Costs, 1905.jpg|thumb|280px|Chart of Manufacturing Costs, 1905]]
The tenth section of ''Systematizing'' focussed on manufacturing costs. Griffith started explaining that a cost system in any manufacturing plant is a necessity, yet in those days there were many manufacturers who hadn't discover its importance. With cost systems Griffith meant a system by means of which the actual costs of manufacturing the product can be accurately determined.&lt;ref name="B 1905 355-86"&gt;Bray (1905, p. 355-86)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the chapter Griffith present a chart of manufacturing cost (see image). This chart is a graphic illustration of the items which enter into the cost of manufacture, the manner in which these items are obtained and, finally, brought together in a permanent form. Griffith commented, that "a study of this chart will enable the student to outline a general plan for a cost system suited to the needs of his particular factory. When the general principles of the cost finding system are understood, it becomes merely a matter of detail to apply those principles to individual factories."&lt;ref name="B 1905 355-86"/&gt;
&lt;!--
=== Voucher system and accounting chart ===
--&gt;

=== ''Accountancy and business management,'' 1909/1921 ===
In 1909 Griffith edited his first book series, entitled "Accountancy and business management." This book series was published in seven volumes and was prepared by a corps of auditors, accountants, attorneys, and specialists in business methods and management, and illustrated with over fifteen hundred engravings. The second edition was published 1921 by the American Technical Society in Chicago.

The table of contents of "Accountancy and business management" was:
:I. Organization, sales, credits, billing, shipping.	
:II. Bookkeeping, accounting, partnerships, manufacturing, voucher records.	
:III. Purchasing, labor records, cost finding, mail order, special forms.	
:IV. Auditing, combinations, corporations, profits, practice.	
:V. Contracts, agency, sales, bills, notes, evidence.	
:VI. Correspondence filing, office devices, department stores.	
:VII. Income tax problems, commercial arithmetic, index.

Griffith had written several section such as the first chapter on "business organization and control", in 1909 also published under the title "Administrative and industrial organization." Another chapter by Griffith, entitled "the voucher system and accounting charts," was in 1917 republished as "Corporation Accounts and Voucher System."

Griffith also wrote the section on "Purchasing and stores" co-authored with W. J. Graham, and the section on "Credits."&lt;ref&gt;''Subscription Books Bulletin,'' Vol. 1-8. (1930). p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; A significant part of the co-authors and collaborators also participated in the 1910 "Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration." Furthermore also a significant part of the content, and almost all illustrations were used in that 1910 business encyclopedia.

=== Segregation of authority ===
In the article "business organization and control" in ''Accountancy and business management,'' (1909) Griffith argued, that the segregation of authority is an universal principles of organization. This purpose of segregation of authority is to simplify, as [[Charles Edward Knoeppel]] (1908) had argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While business as it is now conducted is not as simple as it was in the barter days, it must not be inferred that this segregation of authority is synonymous with complexity, for its very purpose has been to simplify, and that is what it has accomplished. It is only where this segregation has been the result of lack of thought and proper attention, or other like causes, that we find a complex and unsatisfactory condition of affairs. In fact, there is all about us sufficient evidence that many commercial enterprises are being conducted along lines that, as far as evolutional development is concerned, are several stages behind the times.&lt;ref name="Kn 1908 p. 85-86"&gt;Knoeppel (1908), "Maximum Production Through Organization and Supervision" p. 85-86; Cited in: J.B. Griffith (ed.), ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46424 Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration...: Organization; sales; credits; statistics.]'' American School of Correspondence. Vol. 1. 1910. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Griffith in the ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration'' (1910) commented, that "when we go into all of the ramifications of business we find many establishments where minor variations of our plan of organization appear necessary, but in the final analysis, the fundamentals prove to be the same."&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1910, p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt; The working authorities in a manufacturing Business and in a trading Business follow a same scheme (see images).

&lt;gallery caption="Segregation of authority, 1908/10" widths= 240 heights=400 class=center&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,'' 1910 ===
[[File:Cyclopedia of Commerce Advertisement, 1910.jpg|thumb|Cyclopedia of Commerce, 1910&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement for ''Cyclopedia of Commerce,'' in: ''[[Popular Mechanics]],'' April 1910, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1910 the American School of Correspondence published the ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,'' and Griffith had been managing editor. Other authors and collaborators of this work were [[Robert Hiester Montgomery]], [[Arthur Lowes Dickinson]], William M. Lybrand of [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]], [[Oscar E. Perrigo]] and [[Halbert Powers Gillette]]. Among the authorities consulted were [[Horace Lucian Arnold]], [[Charles Buxton Going]], Lawrence R. Dicksee, [[Francis W. Pixley]], [[Charles U. Carpenter]], [[Charles Edward Knoeppel]], [[Harrington Emerson]], [[Clinton Edgar Woods]], [[Charles Ezra Sprague]] and [[Charles Waldo Haskins]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, James Bray. (ed.) et al. ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration.'' p. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1913 review in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]],'' commented that this treatise evidently aims to give a complete review of the entire field of [[accounting]]. The volumes start out with a discussion of the theory of accounts, and then proceed to show the methods of keeping the books of various kinds of organizations, from single proprietors to corporations, and of different kinds of businesses, including wholesale and retail establishments, banks, mail-order houses, hotels, insurance companies, and contracting firms.&lt;ref name = "CAS 1913"&gt;Charles A. Sweetland. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1819776 Reviewed Work: Cyclopedia of Practical Accounting by James B. Griffith]," in: ''Journal of Political Economy,'' Vol. 21, No. 9 (Nov., 1913), pp. 876-877.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1913 review continued, that to one who is familiar with accounting practice, the books contain much suggestive material. Unfortunately the data are poorly organized and there is unnecessary repetition both in text and in illustrative material. The discussion of the theory of accounts is hardly more than an exposition of bookkeeping terminology. The last volume contains a number of "Practical Accounting Problems and Solutions." The compilers of the cyclopedia were unfortunate in picking some of their solutions, notably to Problems 49 and 50. These two solutions appear in the volume of a well-known writer' and are incorrect. Incidentally, the editor of the set neglects to give credit to the author of the solutions, either in a footnote or in the list of "Authorities Consulted." This part of the work would also have been materially improved if solutions for Problems 30 to 47 had been given. The review ends with the remark, that from a mechanical point of view the books are excellent; the half-tone illustrations are especially good and are well selected.&lt;ref name = "CAS 1913"/&gt;

== Reception ==
In his days the work of Griffith was occasionally placed inline with the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], [[Harrington Emerson]], and [[Henry L. Gantt]].&lt;ref name="NAH 1913"/&gt;
In the 1975 article "Who is who in accounting in 1909" the accounting historian Williard E. Stone&lt;ref&gt;[[Vangermeersch, Richard G.J.]] "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/29060 Williard E. Stone, life member of the Academy]," in: ''Accounting Historians Notebook,'' 1993, Vol. 16, no. 1 (spring), pp. 12&lt;/ref&gt; listed Griffith among the foremost authors and collaborators in the field in the year 1909. More in general he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The early 1900s were a [[Horatio Alger, Jr.|Horacio Alger]] time when self improvement, particularly in business knowledge, was a way of life for aspiring people. A large number of business encyclopedias enjoyed a wide distribution. One such compendium, ''Accountancy and Business Management,'' modest subtitle 'A General Reference. Work on Bookkeeping, Accounting, Auditing, Commercial Law, Business Organization, Business Management, Banking, Advertising, Selling, Office and Factory Records, Cost Keeping, Systematizing, etc.,' offered the complete 'body of knowledge' for the young business person in seven small volumes ...&lt;ref name="WES 1975"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the twenty-one authors and collaborators in the field of accounting, listed by Stone (1975), only eight of them were actually accountants.&lt;ref name="WES 1975"/&gt;

'''John Henning''' (2 May 1771 – 8 April 1851) was a Scottish carpenter who turned to sculpturing. His masterpieces were the one-twentieth-scale models he created of the [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon]] and [[Bassae Frieze|Bassae]] friezes.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Malden, John [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12945 Henning, John (1771–1851)] at ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004. (Registration needed for online edn.) Accessed 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  These took him twelve years to complete.&lt;ref name=BMmini&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/j/casts_of_the_parthenon_frieze.aspx John Henning’s miniature casts of the Parthenon frieze] at the British Museum, retrieved June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to gain a copyright on this work and others profited by copying his work.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;

==Biography==
Henning was born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] and became a carpenter like his father. He was noted for his ability as a sculptor when he created cameos of his friends and family. After marrying Catherine Sunter when aged 28 and encouraged by his early cameos he went into business in Glasgow and then Edinburgh attracting clients that included [[Sir Walter Scott]]. Josiah Wedgwood was impressed by his work and agreed to champion them for Henning.&lt;ref name=blurb&gt;Wall, John ''That Most Ingenious Modeller: The Life and Work of John Henning, Sculptor'', Melrose Books, Ely, U.K. 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-906050-58-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, John and Catherine moved to London where Henning saw the newly arrived [[Elgin Marbles]] in [[Burlington House]] and persuaded [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] to allow him to draw and copy them.&lt;ref name=BMmini /&gt;  It was said that a commission from [[Princess Charlotte of Wales|Princess Charlotte]] of a portrait medallion inspired Henning to realise that he could use his drawings to create slate moulds that could be used to reproduce the friezes in miniature.&lt;ref name=blurb/&gt; Henning also took advantage of his sittings with the Princess to introduce her to more radical reading.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; This task was to last twelve years although Henning decided to also add the Bassae frieze to his work, and this did not arrive in England until a few years into his work. One miniature version of the Parthenon frieze was just two inches high, but over twenty four feet long.&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt;

By 1820, Henning was ready to sell his work and it was obvious that he had not copied the remains of the friezes, but recreated them. In the case of the Parthenon frieze he had used drawings taken by [[William Pars]] in 1765, the drawings commissioned from [[Feodor Ivanowitsch]] by Lord Elgin before they were moved to England and importantly drawings made by [[Jacques Carrey]]. The last drawings were not the most detailed, but importantly they were made thirteen years before the explosion that had damaged the Parthenon in 1687.&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt;

One copy of the miniature Parthenon frieze was sold to [[George IV of England|William IV]] for £42 in 1821&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt; but its location is not known. He failed to gain a copyright on this work and others profited by making copies.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt; Very few original copies of these miniatures are known to exist.&lt;ref name=blurb/&gt;

In 1827, Henning and his son created sculptures in the style of the Parthenon frieze for a screen erected at Hyde Park Gate in London. The following year, John Jr. confirmed that he would recreate a copy of the Parthenon frieze for London's [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]]. Although only just over half the length of the 524 feet long original this model was at the correct scale and was constructed from Bath stone in agreement with [[Decimus Burton]], the club's architect.&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt;

Henning also made half-scale models which he hoped to reproduce for more modest buildings. Henning found that they were very popular but the business was captured across Europe by others who had unauthorised copies of his work. Equally distressing to Henning was the low quality of some of the copies. Because of this Henning became a supporter of the emerging laws on copyright but also was unhappy that his success was going unrewarded.&lt;ref name=blurb/&gt;

In 1845, Henning again invested his time based around the friezes. This time he intended to recreate the two friezes as engravings. Trial proofs were made but unfortunately his partner in the enterprise, [[Alfred Robert Freebairn]] (1794–1846), died before either of the works were completed.&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt;
Henning died on 8 April 1851, two years after his wife. He was buried as a pauper in [[Finchley]] Churchyard.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Legacy==
Henning's original slate models were obtained by the [[British Museum]] in 1938. The Athenaeum Club and the screen at Hyde Park are extant. Copies of Henning's work are still being discovered.&lt;ref name=blurb/&gt; Another son [[Archibald Skirving Henning]] became an artist and he has a few paintings in public collections in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Art UK bio|wikidata=Q4786356|name=Archibald Skirving Henning}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died aged 59 in Manchester in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IWU3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA261 Obituary], The Gentleman's Magazine, 1864, retrieved 12 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He had the same name as the Scottish painter [[Archibald Skirving]].

'''Key Tower''' is a [[skyscraper]] on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] in [[Downtown Cleveland|downtown]] [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. Designed by [[architect]] [[César Pelli]], it is the [[List of tallest buildings in Cleveland|tallest building]] in the state of [[Ohio]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|26th-tallest]] in the [[United States]], and the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|165th-tallest in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emporis.com/statistics/worlds-tallest-buildings&lt;/ref&gt; The building reaches 57 stories or {{convert|947|ft|m}} to the top of its spire, and it is visible from up to {{convert|20|mi|km}} away. The tower contains about 1.5 million square feet (139,355&amp;nbsp;m²) of office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=SC6 |title=Society Center |work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |date=1997-07-22 |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key Tower's anchor tenant is [[KeyCorp]], a major regional financial services firm. On the top floor is a boutique intellectual property firm Amin, Turocy &amp; Watson, LLP. In 2014 the law firm of [[BakerHostetler]] announced that it would move its headquarters to the building, taking up several floors being vacated by KeyCorp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BakerHostetler plans move to Key Tower from PNC Center in 2016|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2014/01/bakerhostetler_plans_move_to_k.html|accessdate=4 June 2014|work=Cleveland.com|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international law firm [[Squire Patton Boggs]] is headquartered here and a major tenant. It is also headquarters to [[Dan T. Moore Companies]], located on the 27th floor. Key Tower is connected to the [[Marriott at Key Center]], built in conjunction with the tower, and the older [[Society for Savings Building]]. It is the tallest building between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Chicago]]. It is also the tallest building in the [[Midwest United States]] outside of Chicago.

On January 1st, 2017 [http://themillenniacompanies.com The Millennia Companies] purchased Key Center&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, including Key Tower, [[Marriott at Key Center]], [[Society for Savings Building]], and the underground Memorial Plaza Garage. The purchase price was $267.5 million.

==History==

It was originally built as the '''Society Center''' and was the headquarters for Cleveland-based Society Corporation. Society had recently acquired [[Cleveland Trust]] and canceled Cleveland Trust's plans for an even taller building on Public Square. Its opening ended the [[Terminal Tower]]'s reign as the tallest building in Ohio.

It was renamed Key Tower after Society merged with KeyCorp and took the KeyCorp name. Indeed, it was decided to make Cleveland the headquarters for the new KeyCorp because it was felt the then-Society Center was more commensurate with the merged bank's status as a major bank. Pelli originally intended its design for the [[Wells Fargo Center (Minneapolis)|Norwest Center]] in [[Minneapolis]], but a late change to the site led to Pelli designing a new tower for it.

Key Tower was developed by the [[Richard E. Jacobs Group]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Jarboe |title=Jacobs Group no longer owns stake in Key Center |url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2009/04/jacobs_group_no_longer_owns_st.html |work=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Society Center was completed in 1991 by [http://www.turnerconstruction.com Turner Construction Company], it became the tallest building between [[Chicago]] and [[New York City]].  The {{convert|975|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Comcast Center (office building)|Comcast Center]] in [[Philadelphia]] assumed this distinction in 2007. The Chamber of Commerce Building stood on the tower's site from 1898 to 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=COCB |title=Chamber of Commerce Building |work=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate=2007-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''F-111'', [[James Rosenquist]]'s large [[pop art]] painting, hung in the tower's lobby until building owner [[Richard Jacobs (businessman)|Richard Jacobs]] sold it to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1996. He replaced it in 1998 with ''Songs for Sale'', a mural by artist [[David Salle]].&lt;ref&gt;Litt, Steven. "Salle Mural Quietly Fills Key Tower Void", ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''.

A smaller-scale building was proposed by Pelli to be built in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] during the late 1980s, but the plan was ultimately canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=121788 |title=Key Tower |publisher=[[Emporis]] |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry''' (KCCI) ({{lang-ar| الكويت غرفة التجارة والصناعة}}) is a non-government institution representing business establishments in [[Kuwait]]. The Chamber acts on the behalf of, represents and lobbies for the interests of businesspersons and industrialists in Kuwait.

==History==
The establishment of a Chamber of Commerce was first mooted in 1952. Three years later in 1955 the Chamber was established and in 1959, the election of the Chamber’s first [http://www.kuwaitchamber.org.kw/echamber/website/index.jsp?pageID=ws_boardmembers.jsp&amp;ajax=yes&amp;sessionID=0a01320750954ed9f1b15a475c809ed515cf8c7dc0&amp;pageID=ws_boardmembers.jsp&amp;scriptPage=index.jsp Board of Directors] took place.

KCCI is a truly democratic organisation. The members of the Board of Directors are all elected and its leading figures are known for their contribution to industry and business.During that time, the hearts of the citizens were ready to comprehend every nice and great achievement. The KCCI growth kept in line with the country’s growth and luxury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabtimesonline.com/NewsDetails/tabid/96/smid/414/ArticleID/149749/reftab/69/Default.aspx The Kuwait Chamber Of Commerce And Industry Is Not Just A Huge Commercial Fort But A Lofty Democratic Fort.] ''Arab Times''.

'''Labor rights''' or '''workers' rights''' are a group of [[legal rights]] and claimed [[human rights]] having to do with [[labor relations]] between [[workers]] and their [[employers]], usually obtained under [[labor and employment law]]. In general, these rights' debates have to do with negotiating workers' pay, benefits, and [[Occupational safety and health|safe working conditions]]. One of the most central of these rights is the [[trade union|right to unionize]]. Unions take advantage of [[collective bargaining]] and [[industrial action]] to increase their members' [[wages]] and otherwise change their working situation. Labor rights can also take in the form of [[worker's control]] and [[worker's self management]] in which workers have a democratic voice in decision and policy making. The [[labor movement]] initially focused on this "right to unionize", but attention has shifted elsewhere.

Critics of the labor rights movement claim that regulation promoted by labor rights activists may limit opportunities for work.  In the [[United States]], critics objected to unions establishing [[closed shop]]s, situations where employers could only hire union members. The [[Taft–Hartley Act]] banned the closed shop but allowed the less restrictive [[union shop]].  Taft–Hartley also allowed states to pass [[right-to-work law]]s, which require an [[open shop]] where a worker's employment is not affected by his or her union membership. Labor counters that the open shop leads to a [[free rider problem]].

== Labor Background ==

Throughout history, workers claiming some sort of right have attempted to pursue their interests. During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England]] expressed demand for better wages and working conditions.  One of the leaders of the revolt, [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] famously argued that people were born equal saying, "When [[Adam]] delved and [[Eve]] span, who was then the gentleman?" Laborers often appealed to traditional rights. For instance, English peasants fought against the [[enclosure movement]], which took traditionally communal lands and made them private.

In England 1833, a law was passed saying that any child under the age of 9 could not work, children age 9-13 could only work 8 hours a day, and children aged 14–18 could only work 12 hours a day.

Labor rights are a relatively new addition to the modern corpus of human rights. The modern concept of labor rights dates to the 19th century after the creation of [[labor unions]] following the [[industrialization]] processes. [[Karl Marx]] stands out as one of the earliest and most prominent advocates for workers rights.  His philosophy and economic theory focused on labor issues and advocates his economic system of [[socialism]], a society which would be ruled by the workers. Many of the [[social movement]]s for the rights of the workers were associated with groups influenced by Marx such as the [[socialists]] and [[communists]].  More moderate [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]] supported worker's interests as well. More recent workers rights advocacy has focused on the particular role, exploitation, and needs of women workers, and of increasingly mobile global flows of casual, service, or guest workers.

The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) was formed in 1919 as part of the [[League of Nations]] to protect worker's rights.  The ILO later became incorporated into the [[United Nations]].  The UN itself backed workers rights by incorporating several into two articles of the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], which is the basis of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (article 6-8).  These read:

===Article 23===
# Everyone has the right to work, to free [[choice]] of employment, to just and favorable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.
# Everyone, without any [[discrimination]], has the right to [[equal pay for equal work]].
# Everyone who works has the right to just and favorable [[remuneration]] ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human [[dignity]], and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of [[social protection]].
# Everyone has the right to form and to join [[trade union]]s for the protection of his interests.&lt;ref name="udhr"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html | title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights | work=United Nations | accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article 24===
# Everyone has the [[right to rest and leisure]], including reasonable limitation of [[working hours]] and periodic [[paid holidays|holidays with pay]].

The ILO and several other groups have sought [[international labor standards]] to create [[legal rights]] for workers across the world.  Recent movements have also been made to encourage countries to promote labor rights at the international level through [[fair trade]].&lt;ref name="udhr" /&gt;

== Core Labor Standards ==

Identified by the ILO in the ‘Declaration of the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work’,&lt;ref name="adb.org"&gt;Asian Development Bank 2006, ‘Core Labour Standards Handbook’, Manila http://www.adb.org/documents/core-labor-standards-handbook&lt;/ref&gt;  core labor standards are “widely recognized to be of particular importance”.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 1996 ‘Trade, Employment and Labour Standards: A Study of Core Workers’ Rights and International Trade’&lt;/ref&gt;  They are universally applicable, regardless of whether the relevant conventions have been ratified, the level of development of a country or cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Global Compact, Labour, {{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/TheTenPrinciples/labourStandards.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303183906/http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/TheTenPrinciples/labourStandards.html |archivedate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These standards are composed of qualitative, not quantitative standards and don’t establish a particular level of working conditions, wages or health and safety standards.&lt;ref name="adb.org"/&gt;  They are not intended to undermine the comparative advantage that developing countries may hold. Core labor standards are important human rights and are recognized in widely ratified [[international human rights instruments]] including the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CROC), the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 193 parties, and the ICCPR with 160 parties.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ratification and Reservations: Convention on the Rights of the Child,  {{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/11.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223320/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/11.htm |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}   [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], Ratification and Reservations: International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, {{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223320/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/ratification/4.htm |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Core Labor Standards|core labor standards]] are:
* Freedom of association:&lt;ref&gt;ICCPR Art.22, ILO Convention 87&lt;/ref&gt; workers are able to join trade unions that are independent of government and employer influence;
* The right to collective bargaining:&lt;ref&gt;ICCPR Art.22, ILO Convention 98&lt;/ref&gt; workers may negotiate with employers collectively, as opposed to individually;
* The prohibition of all forms of forced labor:&lt;ref&gt;ICCPR Art. 8, ILO Conventions 29 and 105&lt;/ref&gt; includes security from prison labor and slavery, and prevents workers from being forced to work under duress;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, G 2001 ‘Core Labor Standards in the WTO: Reducing labor to a global commodity’, Working USA , vol.5, Iss. 1; pp 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elimination of the worst forms of child labor:&lt;ref&gt;CROC Art. 32 ILO Convention 138&lt;/ref&gt; implementing a minimum working age and certain working condition requirements for children;
* Non-discrimination in employment : [[equal pay for equal work]].

Very few ILO member countries have ratified all of these conventions due to domestic constraints yet as these rights are also recognised in the UDHR, and form a part of [[customary international law]] they are committed to respect these rights. For a discussion on the incorporation of these core labor rights into the mechanisms of the [[World Trade Organization]], see [[The Recognition of Labour Standards within the World Trade Organisation]]. There are many other issues outside of this core, in the UK employee rights includes the right to employment particulars, an itemised pay statement, a disciplinary process at which they have the right to be accompanied, daily breaks, rest breaks, paid holidays and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/employee-rights |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306090112/http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/employee-rights |archivedate=2011-03-06 |df= }} Employee Rights&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labor rights issues ==

Aside from the right to organize, labor movements have campaigned on various other issues that may be said to relate to labor rights.

=== Hour Limits ===
Many labor movement campaigns have to do with limiting hours in the work place.  19th century labor movements campaigned for an [[Eight-hour day]].  Worker advocacy groups have also sought to limit work hours, making a working week of 40 hours or less standard in many countries.  A [[35-hour workweek]] was established in [[France]] in 2000, although this standard has been considerably weakened since then. Workers may agree with employers to work for longer, but the extra hours are payable [[overtime]]. In the [[European Union]] the working week is limited to a maximum of 48 hours ''including'' overtime (see also [[Working Time Directive]]).

=== Child Labor ===
Labor rights advocates have also worked to combat [[child labor]]. They see child labor as exploitative, cruel, and often economically damaging. Child labor opponents often argue that working children are deprived of an education.  In 1948 and then again in 1989, the United Nations declared that children have a right to social protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prior|first=Katherine|title=Workers' Rights|date=1997|publisher=Franklin Watts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Massachusetts updated their child labor laws that required all minors to have work permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watkins|first=Heidi|title=Teens and Employment|date=2011|publisher=Greenhaven|location=Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace Conditions ===
Labor rights advocates have worked to improve workplace conditions which meet established standards.  During the [[Progressive Era]], the [[United States]] began workplace reforms, which received publicity boosts from [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' and events such as the 1911 [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]].  Labor advocates and other groups often criticize production facilities with poor working conditions as [[sweatshops]] and [[occupational health]] hazards, and campaign for better labor practices and recognition of workers rights throughout the world.

=== Safety and Social Sustainability ===
Recent initiatives in the field of [[sustainability]] have included a focus on [[social sustainability]], which includes promoting workers' rights and safe working conditions, prevention of [[human trafficking]], and elimination of illegal child labor from the sustainably sourced products and services.&lt;ref name="sftool.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/545/social-sustainability|title=Social Sustainability   - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] and [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] have released studies on products that have been identified as using child labor and industries using or funded by human trafficking. Labor rights are defined internationally by sources such as the [http://www.anskaffelser.no/english/socially-responsible-public-procurement/information-about-high-risk-products Norwegian Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (DIFI)] and the [[International Finance Corporation]] performance standards.&lt;ref name="sftool.gov"/&gt;

=== Living Wage ===
The labor movement pushes for guaranteed [[minimum wage]] laws, and there are continuing negotiations about increases to the minimum wage. However, opponents see minimum wage laws as limiting employment opportunities for unskilled and entry level workers.

=== Migrant Workers ===
Legal migrant workers are sometimes abused. For instance, migrants have faced a number of alleged abuses [[Human rights in the United Arab Emirates|in the United Arab Emirates]] ([[Dubai#Human Rights and Labor|including Dubai]]). [[Human Rights Watch]] lists several problems including "nonpayment of wages, extended working hours without overtime compensation, unsafe working environments resulting in death and injury, squalid living conditions in labor camps, and withholding of passports and travel documents by employers."&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/uae12233.htm Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Human Rights Watch, 31-12-2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite laws against the practice, employers confiscate migrant workers' passports.  Without their passports, workers cannot switch jobs or return home.[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=16862]
These workers have little recourse for labor abuses, but conditions have been improving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/UAE.pdf United Arab Emirates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Labor and social welfare minister Ali bin Abdullah al-Kaabi has undertaken a number of reforms to help improve labor practices in his country.&lt;ref name="hrw.org" /&gt;

=== Undocumented Workers ===
The right to equal treatment, regardless of [[gender]], [[ethnicity|origin]] and appearance, [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], is also seen by many as a worker's right. [[Discrimination]] in the work place is illegal in many countries, but some see the [[Income inequality metrics|wage gap]] between genders and other groups as a persistent problem.

==== Undocumented Workers in the United States ====
The National Labor Relations Act recognizes undocumented laborers as employees. However, the supreme court case [[Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB|Hoffman Plastic Compounds Inc. Vs. NLRB]] established that backpay could not be awarded to unlawfully fired undocumented employees due to the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Labor Law - Undocumented Immigrants - Second Circuit Holds Undocumented Workers Are Categorically Barred from Backpay under the National Labor Relations Act - Palma v. NLRB 723 F.3d 176 (2d Cir. 2013)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Recent Cases 1236}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this court decision, it was also stated that the U.S. would support [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|FLSA]] and [[Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act of 1983|MSPA]], without regard to whether or not someone is documented.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Gleeson, Shannon Marie. ''The Intersection of Legal Status and Stratification: The Paradox of Immigration Law and Labor Protections in the United States''. Diss. U of California, Berkeley, 2008. N.p.: ProQuest Dissertations, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Undocumented workers also still have legal protection against discrimination based on national origin. The decision of the Hoffman supreme court case primarily has affected undocumented laborers by preventing them from getting backpay and/or reinstatement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

While no undocumented individual is technically able to work in the United States legally, undocumented folks make up 5% of the workforce.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the U.S., people who were born outside of the country tend to work in riskier jobs and have a higher chance of encountering death on the job. The low wage sectors, which many undocumented folks work in, have the highest rates of wage and hour violation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Estimates claim that 31% of undocumented people work in service jobs. Restaurant work in particular has a 12% rate of undocumented workers.

Undocumented people can and have joined labor unions, and are even credited by a 2008 dissertation for "reinvigorating" the labor movement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because the NLRA protects undocumented workers, it protects their right to organize. However the NLRA excludes workers that are agricultural, domestic, independent contractors, governmental, or related to their employers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nilc.org/issues/immigration-reform-and-executive-actions/powerir/|title=POWER Act &amp; Immigration Reform - National Immigration Law Center|work=National Immigration Law Center|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to speak up against labor abuses was protected further by an immigration reform bill in 2013 with the POWER act, which intended to protect employees who spoke out against labor practices from facing detention or deportation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehandthatfeedsfilm.com/how-can-undocumented-immigrants-legally-form-a-union/|title=How can undocumented immigrants legally form a union?|date=2014-10-16|work=The Hand That Feeds|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, labor unions are not necessarily welcoming of immigrant workers. Within unions, there have been internal struggles, such as when Los Angeles immigrant janitors reorganized service workers. Being a part of the union does not necessarily address all the needs of immigrant workers, and thus wining power within the union is the first step for immigrant workers to address their needs.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bacon|first=David|date=2007|title=Rising from Below: Immigrant Workers Open New Organizing Fronts|url=|journal=Race, Poverty &amp; The Environment|volume=14|issue=1|pages=|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigrant workers often mobilize beyond unions, by campaigning in their communities on intersectional issues of immigration, discrimination, and police misconduct.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

'''Miguel Ruiz''' (1856–1912) founded a [[coffee]] processing company which would later become "Jimenez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc." the makers of ''Café Yaucono''.

==Early years==
Ruiz, a native of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], began working in the coffee industry at a young age. His interest in that sector of [[agriculture]] led him to establish a small coffee processing company in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|Miramar]], a section of San Juan. In 1896, Ruiz started elaborating coffee using rudimentary equipment. His small operation started to grow and he soon sent for his cousin-in-law, Tiburio Jiménez, who lived in [[Spain]]. In 1911, Jiménez went to work and immediately, he too fell in love with the coffee industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yaucono.com/History/history3.htm Timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314203051/http://www.yaucono.com/History/history3.htm |date=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, tragedy befell upon the family and Miguel Ruiz died. He left the company in the hands of his family and Jimenez.

=="Cafe Yaucono"==

Tomas Prado, from [[Yauco, Puerto Rico|Yauco]] was the owner of "The Coffee Co." and in 1914, created the coffee brand "Cafe Yaucono".  Jiménez became interested in the brand and soon began negotiations with Prado with the intention of buying him out. In 1916, Prado sold "The Coffee Co." and its brand "Yaucono" to the heirs of Migul Ruiz. In 1917, the Ruiz family sold the company and Jiménez quit the company. Soon afterwards, Jiménez started his own company with Juan Fernández which they named "Jiménez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs.".

==Jiménez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc.==
In 1921, the company, which was incorporated and renamed "Jimenez &amp; Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc.", bought a lot in the [[Manuel Fernandez Juncos (Journalist)|Fernández Juncos]] Ave. and built a two-story building. The company operated in the first floor and the Jiménez family lived in the second floor. Jiménez married and had three children, among them José Enrique Jiménez.

In 1931, Juan Fernández sold his part of the company to Jiménez. During this period the company was faced with limitations and hardships. The [[Great Depression]], hurricanes and [[World War II]] almost completely bankrupted the entire coffee industry in Puerto Rico. Jiménez was forced to close his company on two occasions during this time.

When Jiménez reopened the company, the demand for coffee was so great that its sales soared. In 1957, Tiburcio's son José Enrique, began to work for "Yaucono" and in 1960, he was named Manager of the Sales and Marketing departments.  José Enrique started a strong advertising campaign and in 1963 introduced the "Cafe Yaucono" character "Mama Inés", becoming one of the biggest marketing symbols in Puerto Rican history. In 1965, José Enrique was named president and [[CEO]] of the company.

==Postscript==
In 1985, "Café Yaucono" received the highest award from the Puerto Rico Product Association, the "International Award for Quality". In 1996, "Cafe Yaucono" received the "Commercial Prestige Award" from Spain. "Cafe Yaucono" controls 40% of the coffee market in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yaucono.com/History/history3.htm Cafe Yaucono] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314203051/http://www.yaucono.com/History/history3.htm |date=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miguel Ruiz died in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] in 1912 and Tiburcio Jiménez died in 1975 in the same city.

'''OCEAN Design Research Association''' focuses on interdisciplinary research by design in the intersection between architecture, urban- and landscape design, industrial design, and a variety of related creative disciplines. The not-for-profit association is registered in [[Norway]].

In 1994 OCEAN was founded by [[Michael Ulrich Hensel]], Ulrich Königs, Tom Verebes and Bostjan Vuga as a think-tank for experimental design in architecture located in London. In 1995 the group expanded into a network with groups in Cologne, Helsinki, London, Ljubljana and Oslo. In 1998 the groups in [[Cologne]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Oslo]] fused and operated under the name OCEAN NORTH until 2006. During the same year the revision of the network and its expansion began. In result OCEAN was renamed and restructured as an independent and not-for-profit design research association registered in Norway in 2008.

Today OCEAN conducts a wide scope of research by design, bringing together the disciplines of architecture, urban and landscape design, industrial and product design, engineering, biology, ecology, micro-climatology and musical composition. The objective of the association is to initiate, undertake, promote and host collaboration in design research with the aim for improve the built environment and anthroposphere, by means of developing and exploring new paradigms to design that are heterogeneous, performative, context-specific, and culturally, socially and environmentally sustainable. The network is active in the intersection between practice, research and education.

Current research areas include [[Architecture]] and [[Biology]], Assembly Buildings, Auxiliary Architectures, Computational Design and Augmented Reality, Grounds and Envelopes, Matter and Energy Interaction, [[Performance-oriented Design]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.performanceorienteddesign.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hensel, M. (2013). Performance-oriented Architecture - Rethinking Architecture and the Built Environment. London: AD Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Systems Oriented Design]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.systemsorienteddesign.net&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Design, Systems-oriented Design, and Sound Environments.

The work of OCEAN has been published and exhibited widely, including the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]] 2002 and 2004, and the Beijing Architectural Biennale 2008. Among its best known work to date is the ‘World Centre for Human Concerns’ designed for the exhibition ‘A New World Trade Centre’, exhibited at the Max Protetch Gallery in New York, the American Pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]] 2002 and the German Museum of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Protetch M. Ed. (2004). ''A New World Trade Center – Design Proposals from leading Architects Worldwide''. New York: Regan Books Harper Collins. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme for a 'World Center for Human Concerns' pointed towards a new institution that could provide representation to all people above and beyond nation-state representation. The intention was to project a forum for political processes, with the aim to overcome violent conflict in result of the existence of multiple forms of acceptable representation.

He went on to study law at the [[University of Zululand]], graduating in 1986 with a [[diploma]] in law.&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;  After graduating he worked as a clerk and prosecutor at the [[Kabokweni]] Magistrate's Court.&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbs"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2016/07/01/the-black-knight-of-africa-how-robert-gumede-is-expanding-his-legacy-across-the-continent/#675cd92e4951 |title=The Black Knight Of Africa:  How Robert Gumede is Expanding His Legacy Across the Continent |last=Nsehe |first=Mfonobong |website=Forbes |access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gumede was employed by the Ministry of Justice for a time before leaving that position in 1988.&lt;ref name="afs" /&gt;

==Business career==
In 1988 Gumede left his job with the  Ministry of Justice due to his political activities during [[apartheid]], starting his business career when he founded Gijima Electronic And Security Systems.&lt;ref name="forbs" /&gt; Gumede's worked as a business consultant after moving to Johannesburg in 1992.  This led him to identify a number of business opportunities and by the mid-1990s he had registered a number of companies with the name ''Gijima'' ranging from a firm that provided protection services to the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) led Mpumalanga government&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt; to a [[Office stationary|stationary]] company.&lt;ref name="afs" /&gt;  Gumede's most successful venture was the IT company he setup in 1997 that successfully received government tenders to develop and deploy IT solutions for the [[Department of Justice and Correctional Services]] services and the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]].  The IT company was consolidated in 2002 into Gijima Afrika Smart Technologies (GijimaASTP) which went on to win additional tenders from the government owned telecoms monopoly [[Telkom (South Africa)|Telkom]] to produce phonecards.&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;

In 2011 Gumede's company GijimaAST settled out of court with the Department of Home Affairs after a dispute over a tender project worth R2.3bn due to escalating project costs.&lt;ref name="iol"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/siu-r360m-it-tender-was-rigged-1797803 |title=SIU: R360m IT tender was rigged | publisher = IOL News |last=Magome |first=Mogomotsi |date=21 December 2014 |language=en |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2014 the Special Investigating Unit of South Africa concluded that a R360 million tender by the [[Department of Rural Development and Land Reform]], and the State Information Technology Agency awarded to GijimaAST was irregular.&lt;ref name="iol" /&gt;  Reports by the [[Sunday Independent (South Africa)|Sunday Independent newspaper]] about the alleged non-delivery on a government tender by GijimaAST resulted in Gumede threatening to file a R1 billion defamation lawsuit against the publication.&lt;ref name="iol" /&gt;

==Politics==
Gumede is open about his political and financial support for the governing party of South Africa, the ANC and has a close friendship with former ANC treasurer general [[Mathews Phosa]].&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt; In 2016 he donated a fleet of 12 vehicles to the ANC's election campaign for the [[South African municipal elections, 2016|South African municipal elections of 2016]].&lt;ref name="new24"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.news24.com/Elections/News/it-billionaire-gives-12-vehicles-to-the-anc-20160614 |title=IT billionaire gives 12 vehicles to the ANC |website=News24 |access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Daily Maverick]] alleges that Gumede is part of an economic elite in South Africa that owes its existence to a system of patronage created by the African National Congress.&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-01-21-south-africas-power-elite/ |title=South Africa's power elite |last=Waal |first=Mandy De |date=21 January 2013 |website=[[Daily Maverick]] |language=en-ZA |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 a [[Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]] article alleged that Gumede provided substantial support to [[Emmerson Mnangagwa|Emmerson Mnangagwa's]] election campaign during the [[Zimbabwean general election, 2018|Zimbabwean general election]] that year.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2018-08-04-sa-tycoon-funded-emmerson-mnangagwa-campaign/ |title=SA tycoon 'funded Emmerson Mnangagwa campaign' |last=Mvumvu |first=Zingisa |date=5 August 2018 |website=[[Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]] |access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is illegal in Zimbabwe for foreigners to fund local elections.

The cocktail is one of the most commonly ordered cocktails in many American bars, though usually referred to as a "vodka soda, splash of cran."
It is served in a [[rocks glass]].&lt;ref&gt;socialandcocktail.co.uk [http://www.socialandcocktail.co.uk/cocktails/rose-kennedy-cocktail/ Rose Kennedy Cocktail]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr.''' (March 2, 1928 &amp;ndash; May 22, 2004) was an American businessman. He was the fourth generation of his family to lead [[S. C. Johnson &amp; Son|S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.]], which is headquartered in [[Racine, Wisconsin]].  He was the son of [[Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr.]] and the great-grandson of company founder, [[Samuel Curtis Johnson Sr.]]  Johnson, a celebrated business icon, turned a relatively small [[wax]] company into a multibillion-dollar global household name.&lt;ref name="Visionary"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and education==
Johnson grew up in [[Racine, Wisconsin]] and spent most of his life there. A graduate of [[Asheville School]], Sam attended [[Cornell University]] and was selected for membership in the [[Sphinx Head Society]] before his 1950 graduation with a bachelor's in economics. He then attended the [[Harvard Business School]], from which he graduated in 1952 with a master's in business administration. Johnson also served in the [[U.S. Air Force]] as an intelligence officer for 2 years.

==Family==
Johnson met his wife, Imogene Powers Johnson, at Cornell University in 1946. They wed in 1954 and had been married fifty years at the time of his death. Johnson and his wife had four children, [[S. Curtis Johnson|Samuel Curtis "Curt" Johnson III]], [[Helen Johnson-Leipold]], [[Herbert Fisk Johnson III|Herbert Fisk "Fisk" Johnson III]] and [[Winnie Johnson-Marquart|Winifred "Winnie" (Johnson) Marquart]], as well as twelve grandchildren and three step-grandchildren at the time of his death.

==''Carnauba, A Son’s Memoir''==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sc johnson carnauba family.jpg|thumb|Johnson and his family in front of the replica Sikorsky S-38]] --&gt;

Johnson's father, [[Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr.|Herbert Fisk "H.F." Johnson Jr.]], and a team of [[Johnson Wax]] employees undertook a two-month, {{convert|7500|mi|km|adj=on}} expedition to northeast [[Brazil]] in 1935 in search of a sustainable source of [[carnauba wax]]. On his return, he published a book, dedicating the book to his son: "To Sammy, I hope you make this trip some day. It changed my life. Love, Dad."&lt;ref name="Son"&gt;{{cite journal
  | title = Son, Husband, Father &amp; Grandfather
  | journal = Samuel C. Johnson Commemorative Journal
  | page = 27
  | publisher = S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.
  | location = Racine, WI
  | year = 2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Sixty-three years later, in 1998, Johnson recreated his father's journey with his two sons. Johnson undertook the journey, documented in a 2001 film called ''Carnauba: A Son’s Memoir'', in a replica [[Sikorsky S-38]] amphibious plane like the one his father used. During the course of the film, Johnson reflects on his somewhat difficult relationship with his often-absent father as well as his own battle with alcoholism. Said Johnson of the journey, "I started to get this idea that some people thought was crazy, but something was telling me to do it… to recreate my father’s airplane and retrace his journey. [My wife] Gene said I was doing it to spend more time with my father after all these years... in the end that turned out to be true."&lt;ref name="Son"/&gt;

==Environmental accomplishments==
Johnson was once described by [[Fortune magazine|''Fortune'' magazine]] in 1993 as "corporate America’s leading environmentalist." Johnson was committed to environmental causes, stating, "We must make sure that we step softly on the land... Once you destroy an old growth forest, or a special plant in the Amazon, or a reef around an atoll, it's gone forever."&lt;ref name="Values"/&gt;

===Leader of the CFC ban===
Johnson was one of the first business leaders to recognize the danger to the [[Earth]]'s ozone layer from [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs), a then-popular [[propellant]] in [[aerosol]] products, voluntarily banning the substance from all of S.C. Johnson's products in 1975 to the shock and anger of many people inside the company and across the nation.&lt;ref name="Remembered"&gt;{{cite journal
  | title = Samuel C. Johnson: A Life Remembered
  | journal = A Tribute to Samuel C. Johnson: 1928-2004
  | page = 26
  | publisher = S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc
  | location = Racine, WI
  | year = 2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The then-unproven scientific research led Johnson to publish a letter to the public explaining his decision. "Our own company scientists confirm that as a scientific hypothesis it may be possible.... We concur that the pressing need for reliable scientific investigation.... We at Johnson Wax are taking this action in the interest of our customers and the public in general during a period of uncertainty and scientific inquiry."&lt;ref name="Aerosols"&gt;{{cite journal

  | page = 16
  | publisher = S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc
  | location = Racine, WI
  | origyear = 1975| year = 2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years, Johnson encouraged his scientists to develop the company's many non-CFC aerosol propellants and pulled his aerosol business out of several countries in which CFCs were mandated in aerosol production. Three years after Johnson recalled and ceased production of all CFC products, the U.S. government corroborated the research of the substance's harmful effects and unilaterally banned CFCs. Johnson was praised for his early decision.&lt;ref name="Remembered" /&gt;

===The World Business Council for Sustainable Development===
Johnson was a founding member of the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD).

Johnson incorporated environmentally responsible behavior into his business and believed that all businesses could be successful with the same mindset. Said Johnson of his involvement with the council, "We aggressively seek out eco-efficiencies--ways of doing more with less--because it makes us more competitive when we reduce and eliminate waste and risk from our products and processes. And it saves us money. By developing products that are as safe as possible for people and the environment, we improve our market share."&lt;ref name="Industry"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBCSD named Johnson a member of the Order of Outstanding Contributors to Sustainable Development in 2003.

===The President’s Council on Sustainable Development===
Because of Johnson's work with the WBCSD, President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed him to the President's Council on Sustainable Development in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://clinton4.nara.gov/PCSD/&lt;/ref&gt; The group advised President Clinton and Vice President [[Al Gore]] until 1999 on ways to strengthen a community by improving the local economy, helping save the environment, and promoting equal opportunities for every American.&lt;ref name="PCSD"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fight against dirty coal===
In 2003, Johnson personally financed an in-depth, grass-roots driven campaign against [[Wisconsin Energy Corporation]]’s proposal to build three new [[coal plant]]s in [[Oak Creek, Wisconsin]], stating, "I think their choice is a terrible mistake considering the health and quality of life risks that coal presents."&lt;ref name="Coal"&gt;{{cite web

The campaign, organized under the moniker of RESET (Responsible Energy for Southeastern Wisconsin's Tomorrow), consisted of [[advertising|print and radio ads]] as well as a [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs education program]]. Citing that the already-existent seventeen Wisconsin coal plants produced 60% more [[smog]]-forming [[nitric oxide]] [[pollution]] and 63% more [[soot]]-producing [[sulfur oxide]] pollution than that allowed by the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref name="Clean"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the group delayed but failed to derail new coal plant construction.

===The Nature Conservancy===
A long-time member of both the President's Conservation Council of the [[Nature Conservancy]] and the National Development Council of the Nature Conservancy, Johnson and his company partnered with the Conservancy to create a reserve in the [[Caatinga]] region of northeastern Brazil, which he dedicated to the memory of his father. Johnson's reserve, the largest private Caatinga reserve in Brazil, protects 173 species of birds, 40 species of mammals, and 140 species of plants.&lt;ref name="Remembered"/&gt;  For his work, the [[Ceará]] (Brazil) Legislative Assembly named Johnson an honorary citizen of the State of Ceará in 2000. The following year, the Wisconsin Chapter of The Nature Conservancy elected Johnson Honorary Trustee.

==Philanthropist==
In addition to his environmental work, Johnson greatly contributed to education, better health, and greater opportunities for the people of his community and around the world. Although his financial contributions were considerable—his corporate donations were around 5% annually—Johnson preferred to become personally involved with many philanthropic organizations.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news 
  | title = Samuel C. Johnson: March 2, 1928--May 22, 2004

Said Johnson in 1988, "For voluntarism to take hold as part of a company's culture, there must be a key executive who sets the example by personal involvement.... I spend a good twenty to thirty percent of my time, or about two days of every seven, on what I call ‘not-for-profit’ activities.... Raising money is only one part of voluntarism; indeed it is not the most important. A more important part is the devotion of time by the people who actually service the organizations and spend a good portion of their free time working at no pay."&lt;ref name="Enterprise2"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mayo Clinic===
Johnson was the longest serving public member of the [[Mayo Foundation]] [[Board of Trustees]], serving from 1967 to 1990 and acting as one-time Chairman. Mayo honored Johnson for his contributions in 1991 during the groundbreaking ceremonies of the $26-million-dollar state-of-the-art S.C. Johnson Medical Research Center on the Mayo Clinic’s {{convert|140|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]. In 2004, the year of his death, Johnson, his family, and the S.C. Johnson Fund donated more than $12 million to the establishment of Mayo’s Samuel C. Johnson Program in the Genomics of Addiction.

Johnson reflected on his contributions to the Mayo Clinic in 1991: "I’ve made a commitment to this research center because I believe in the importance of medical research; I believe in the power of science to help relieve human suffering; and I believe in putting able, curious minds to work for the betterment of mankind."&lt;ref name="Remembered" /&gt;

===The Smithsonian Institution===
Johnson first publicly promoted his love of the arts in 1962 with S.C. Johnson's ART:USA, the Johnson Collection of [[History of painting#Contemporary painting into the 21st century|Contemporary American Painting]].&lt;ref name="Remembered3"&gt;{{cite journal

  | page = 12
  | publisher = S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc
  | location = Racine, WI
  | year = 2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first corporate-sponsored touring art collections, ART:USA featured 102 paintings by living American artists and toured 18 cities around the world for two years prior to a two-and-a-half-year tour through 25 American cities, breaking attendance records around the world.&lt;ref name="Remembered4"&gt;{{cite journal

  | publisher = S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.
  | location = Racine, WI
  | year = 2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson donated the collection to the [[Smithsonian]] Institution in the mid-sixties citing its value because it had "reached people around the world" and "enhanced the company’s reputation for doing the unusual in the name of excellence."&lt;ref name="Remembered4"/&gt;

===Cornell University and the Johnson School of Management===
Johnson served as a Trustee Emeritus and Presidential Councillor at [[Cornell University]], his [[alma mater]]. In 1984, Johnson and his family made a $20 million endowment gift to the [[Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management]] that was named after Johnson's great-grandfather, who founded Johnson Wax. In 1989, Johnson was named to the Johnson School of Management Hall of Honor in recognition of his advisory council leadership.&lt;ref name="Remembered5"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;   Later gifts to Cornell, including gifts in 2004 in the amount of $5 million to establish the Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise as well as $2.5 million to create the S.C. Johnson Professorship in Sustainable Global Enterprise, supported the teaching of business and sustainability at the University.  An additional gift created a new facility for the [[Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology]].&lt;ref name="Remembered6"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Prairie School===
Johnson's wife, Imogene Powers Johnson founded the Prairie School in [[Racine, Wisconsin]], along with good friend Willie Hilpert in 1965.  According to Johnson there was "a need in our community to augment our respected public school system with a curriculum and a learning environment to develop individual student achievement in a college preparatory program."&lt;ref name="Enterprise3"&gt;{{cite book

The children of many S. C. Johnson employees attend the school to this day. This pre-K-12 college preparatory private school features small classes and an emphasis on strong academics, extra curricular activities, and community activism. The unique architecture of the school was influenced by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]’s designs. 
Johnson served as the school’s Chairman of the Board until 1983, when he was named Founding Chairman Emeritus, a position he held until his death. His wife Imogene continues on the school’s board in the same position.

===Downtown Racine, Wisconsin===
Johnson took part in the organization of the Downtown Racine Development Corporation in the 1980s, a community effort to restore the historic downtown area of the city which is the hometown of Johnson and his companies. His employees were among the local citizens to first donate time and money and to convince the local government to donate millions to restoration projects, including developing the harbor along [[Lake Michigan]] to include a festival site.&lt;ref name="Enterprise3"/&gt;

Johnson further contributed to the revitalization of the downtown Racine area in 2002, when he commissioned [[William McDonough]], a pioneer in green-architecture, to design the Johnson Building.  Built on a former empty parking lot in the middle of the downtown area, the building is global headquarters for [[Johnson Outdoors]] and [[Johnson Financial Group]].  Local government officials named the street to the south of the building "Sam Johnson Parkway" in Johnson's honor.&lt;ref name="Remembered7"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business accomplishments==
In 1967, Johnson became chairman of [[S. C. Johnson &amp; Son|S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.]], and turned a $171 million floor [[wax]] company into a multibillion-dollar empire of four global companies which now employ over 28,000 people and sell products in 110 countries.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Johnson's biggest impact on the business was his role in [[Diversification (marketing strategy)|diversification]]. Said Johnson, "The primary objective for a corporate leader is to ensure institutional survival.... To survive you have to grow. To grow you have to diversify... When a company is diversified into various fields, it is rarely seriously vulnerable to the ups and downs that ravage individual business. And if you are geographically diversified... then you have some insulation between yourself and localized political and economic trouble."&lt;ref name="Enterprise4"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

===S.C. Johnson &amp; Son===
Johnson's great-grandfather, [[Samuel Curtis Johnson Sr.]], founded the S.C. Johnson Company in 1886 as a [[parquet floor]] manufacturing business. The company, renamed S.C. Johnson &amp; Son in 1906 when Johnson's grandfather, Herbert Fisk Johnson Sr., became a partner,  began selling wax for hardwood floors in the early 20th century as an additional service. The wax business became more lucrative than the parquet floor business as the company developed wax for use on surfaces as diverse as dance floors and airplanes.&lt;ref name="Enterprise5"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's father, Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr., later joined the company commonly referred to as Johnson Wax and became president in 1928. Johnson joined the company in 1954 as Assistant to the President and was promoted to New Products Director in 1955, where he spearheaded the development of the [[aerosol]] [[insecticide]], what he called "the first Johnson Wax product without wax."&lt;ref name="Remembered8"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;    He went on to create the first aerosol [[air freshener]] ([[Glade (brand)|Glade]]), the first aerosol [[insect repellent]] ([[OFF!]]) and the first aerosol furniture polish ([[Pledge (brand)|Pledge]].)

In 1958, Johnson became Vice President of the newly formed New Service Products Division and in 1960, he moved to [[London]] and served the company as European Regional Director. It was in this capacity that he noticed other American products on a store shelf in [[Italy]] and became determined to never again be late to a global market.&lt;ref name="Remembered8"/&gt;

Before becoming elected company President, Johnson served as international Vice President in 1962 and moved back to Racine in 1963 as Executive Vice President. In 1967, he was also elected Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In 1972, he stepped down as President but continued in his capacities as Chairman and CEO of the consumer business until 1988. In 1993, he was elected non-executive Chairman of the Board, a position he held until his retirement in 2000, when he became Chairman Emeritus of what was then known as SC Johnson – A Family Company.

===JohnsonDiversey===
Johnson further diversified his company's offerings in 1979 when he established Worldwide Innochem, a specialty chemical business. Later known as Johnson Professional and then Johnson Polymer, the business became an independent company in 1997. In 2002, the company acquired DiverseyLever and became [[JohnsonDiversey, Inc.]], the second largest business-to-business hygiene products company in the world. The company's motto, "Clean is just the beginning," refers to Diversey's position as a worldwide leader in the development and marketing of cleaning and hygiene solutions for commercial, institutional, and industrial facilities.&lt;ref name="Remembered9"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johnson Financial Group===
Johnson led his company into the finance industry in 1970 with the establishment of the Heritage Bank &amp; Trust (now Johnson Bank) in Racine. The company, which became the [[Johnson Financial Group|Johnson Financial Group, Inc.]], further expanded to include Johnson Trust, Johnson Asset Management, Johnson Insurance, Johnson Investment Services, and a number of international businesses in [[Europe]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="Remembered10"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson Bank is one of the five largest privately owned community banks and Johnson Insurance is one of the top 100 insurance brokers in the United States. Johnson was the group's Chairman of the Board at the time of his death.

===Johnson Outdoors===
Johnson's foray into diversification for his one-time wax-only family business included expanding into the outdoors industry in 1970. That year, Johnson merged Johnson Reels with the company's first outdoor acquisition, Minn Kota Motors, into Johnson Diversified, Inc. Johnson Diversified acquired Eureka! Tent in 1973, [[Scubapro]] and Old Town Canoe in 1974, and fourteen other businesses over the course of two decades.&lt;ref name="Enterprise6"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
           
Johnson Diversified became Johnson Worldwide Associates in 1977 before Johnson's family bought out the subsidiary in 1986, and took it public with offerings in 1987 and again in 1988. In 2000, JWA was renamed [[Johnson Outdoors|Johnson Outdoors, Inc.]] At the time of his death, Johnson was Chairman of the Johnson Outdoors’ Executive Committee and Director of the Board.&lt;ref name="Remembered11"&gt;{{cite journal

== Industrial cities ==

=== Existing industrial cities ===

MODON has set up 35 [[industrial city|industrial cities]], including five MODON Oases (industrial cities set-up for women workers), and oversees the organization of these cities spread over various regions of the Kingdom.

The [[investments]] in these cities exceed 500 billion riyals ($133 billion). These industrial cities employ more than 528 thousand workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Modon.gov.sa/English/Pages/default.aspx Modon official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124100110/http://www.modon.gov.sa/English/Pages/default.aspx |date=2010-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ready-built factories ====

MODON built ready industrial buildings, on an area of 1500 m², consisting areas for [[Manufacturing|production]], parking, [[landscaping]], security room and management and utilities. Ready-built factories are one of the pilot projects offered by MODON to serve industry, in a number of industrial cities, serving medium and small entrepreneurs alike. The idea of this project focuses on easing the production process of the investor wherein they do not have to engage in the time-consuming design and construction processes. By the end of 2016, MODON was successful in providing 604 ready-built factories, including factories under construction, in a number of industrial cities.

==== Sudair Industrial City ====

[[Sudair Industrial City]] set out to change the concept of industrial cities by providing integrated services, both key services such as water and energy and support services such as housing, education, business and [[recreation]] centers, research centers and transportation, among others.  Strategically located on a highway between Riyadh and Al-Qassim. Development of this city started in 2009.

=== Industrial Cities under development ===

Modon is developing new industrial cities in Sudair, Jazan, Ar’ar, Al-Kharj, Al-Gurayaat, Zulfi, Al-Baha and a second industrial estate in Jeddah. Also, Modon is re-developing existing industrial cities, as well as building model factories.

Modon is also establishing industrial cities in the [[reformatories]] of  Al-Ha'er and [[Jeddah]] in cooperation with the Public Administration of Prisons.

== Director Generals of MODON ==
[[Tawfiq Al Rabiah]] was Director General of MODON from April 2007 to January 2012.&lt;ref name=jef&gt;{{cite web|title=H.E. Dr. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah|url=http://www.jef.org.sa/?q=node/535|publisher=Jeddah Economic Forum|accessdate=30 August 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
'''''The Intangibles of Leadership''''' uncovers patterns in the attributes that truly distinguish those who succeed at the top. After more than a decade of senior executive assessments, CEO interviews, and proprietary research, Davis found that extraordinary leaders possess certain characteristics that fall between the lines of existing leadership models, yet are fundamental to executive success. Davis explains each of these qualities, the people who exemplify them, how to detect them in others, and how to develop the subtle characteristics that will enable leaders to stand out from the pack. The book has been highly reviewed and was named as a "Top Business Book of 2010 by Library Journal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/collectiondevelopmentspecialty2/888437-483/lj_best_business_books_2010.html.csp#management BS010611BestBusiness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120052045/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/collectiondevelopmentspecialty2/888437-483/lj_best_business_books_2010.html.csp#management |date=2013-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ten Intangibles outlined in the book are:
# Wisdom
# Will
# Executive Maturity
# Integrity
# Social Judgment
# Presence
# Self-Insight
# Self-Efficacy
# Fortitude
# Fallibility

According to the author, the book is a practical atlas of the characteristics that most define extraordinary leaders and their underlying psychological mechanisms. It was designed as a mirror to help executives think about how they approach leadership and gain insights that can enable them to grow and develop.

'''The Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki''' was founded in 1939 and is an organisation of more than 6300 [[business]] owners in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. It is one of the 21 regional organisations of the [[Federation of Finnish Enterprises]], which has the largest membership of all business-related federations in Finland.

The mission of the organisation is to create a favourable [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] climate and provide its members with information, [[Mentorship|mentoring]], [[Business networking|networking]], events and [[education]]al opportunities.

==The Regions and Young Entrepreneurs Network==
The Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki is divided into 7 regions:

*Helsingin Vanhankaupungin Yrittäjät
*Itä-Helsingin Yrittäjät
*Kanta-Helsingin Yrittäjät
*Koillis-Helsingin Yrittäjät
*Helsingin Yrittäjät Töölö ry
*Lauttasaaren Yrittäjät and
*Länsi-Helsingin Yrittäjät

In addition, the organisation has its own informal network HYNY for [[entrepreneur]]s less than 35 years of age. Founded in 2006, HYNY helps young entrepreneurs to learn and grow, leading to greater business success. For its members HYNY provides [[training]], events and networking opportunities.

==History== 
The founding meeting of the Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki was held 10 January 1939. At that time the members consisted mainly of industry associations but soon more and more independent entrepreneurs became members.

Due to the change in regulations in 1962, the name of the organisation was changed to Suur-Helsingin Yrittäjät ry and the organisational activities and number of members increased. Caused by the strong development of the region, several structural solutions were implemented and organisation’s activities took their current form. In addition, [[Espoo]] and [[Vantaa]] founded their own regional organisations in 1979, thus the responsibilities of these strongly developing and growing regions were divided and organisational activities redefined.

The original mission statement: bring entrepreneurs together, influence and safeguard the common interests, has never changed its core. The most significant change is its key function: the nature of the organisation as an information, mentoring, networking, events and educational opportunities provider for its members.

In 2009 the Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki celebrated its 70th anniversary. In the same year the organisation hosted the National Entrepreneur’s Day at the [[Helsinki Fair Centre]].

A '''trade office''', sometimes known as a '''trade representation''', '''commercial office''', or '''trade mission''', is an official establishment that promotes the [[commerce|commercial]] interests of a [[government]] (such as a city, state, or country) in a foreign [[Capital city|capital]]. The head of such an establishment is typically called a [[trade representative]] or commercial representative.

{{main|Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office}}

Due to the [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|limited recognition]] of the Republic of China ([[Taiwan]]) as a result of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]'s [[One-China policy]], many countries do not have formal diplomatic relations with the Taiwanese government. Taiwan's interests in these countries and these countries' interests in Taiwan are usually represented by one or more trade missions which function as [[de facto embassy|de facto embassies]] or [[consulate]]s.

The '''Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs'''  is currently the fourth ranking position in the [[U.S. Department of State]] that is intended to help ensure that [[public diplomacy]] is practiced in combination with [[Public administration|public affairs]] and traditional diplomacy to advance U.S. interests and security. The Under Secretary oversees three bureaus at the Department of State: [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs|Educational and Cultural Affairs]], [[Bureau of Public Affairs|Public Affairs]], and [[Bureau of International Information Programs|International Information Programs]]. Also reporting to the Under Secretary are the [[Office of Policy, Planning and Resources for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs]] and the [[Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy]].

The position was created on October 1, 1999, during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration after Title XIII, Section 1313 of the [[Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998]] (112 Stat. 2681-776). Section 2305 of the Act (112 Stat. 2681-825) increased the number of Under Secretaries of State from five to six. Subdivision A of the Act, also known as the Foreign Affairs Agencies Consolidation Act of 1998, abolished the [[United States Information Agency]] and the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]].

The position of Under Secretary is currently vacant. [[Heather Nauert]] previously served as acting Under Secretary, who replaced [[Steve Goldstein (diplomat)|Steve Goldstein]], who was dismissed summarily by President Trump on March 13, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thinkprogress.org/trump-state-department-fox-host-141281554ef5/ Trump installs former ‘Fox and Friends’ host as under secretary of state]&lt;/ref&gt; Appointments to the position require confirmation by the Senate. The position is ranked the fourth highest in the State Department.

The '''William A. Clark House''', also known as "Clark's Folly",&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; was a [[mansion]] located at 962 [[Fifth Avenue]] on the northeast corner of its intersection with East 77th Street on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]].
It was demolished in 1927 and replaced with a luxury apartment building ([[960 Fifth Avenue]]).

==History==
===Construction===
[[William A. Clark]], a wealthy entrepreneur and politician from [[Montana]], commissioned the New York City firm of [[Lord and Hewlett|Lord, Hewlett &amp; Hull]] to build the house in 1897. The house was completed in 1911, after numerous legal disputes,&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/12/11/102631403.pdf Senator Clark's New Home Causes a Suit] ''New York Times'', December 11, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of $7 million&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; ({{Inflation|US|7000000|1911|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). The house contained 121 rooms, 31 baths, four art galleries, a [[swimming pool]], a concealed [[garage (residential)|garage]], and a private [[wikt:underground|underground]] [[rail line]] to bring in [[coal]] for heat.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{cite news|title='Clark's Folly' Brings Price of $3,000,000 in Sale|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19270202&amp;id=C8oaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JEoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3961,1489445&amp;safe=on&amp;hl=en|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=Pittsbugh Press|date=February 2, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that Clark bought a [[quarry]] in [[New Hampshire]], at a cost of $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1907|r=-3|fmt=eq}}), and built a railroad to get out the stone for the building. He also bought a [[bronze]] [[foundry]] employing 200 men to manufacture the bronze fittings.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; In addition, he imported marble from [[Italy]], oak from [[Sherwood Forest]] in [[England]], and parts of old [[France|French]] [[château]]x for the interior.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

The building of the mansion is described in the bestselling biography of Clark's daughter, [[Huguette Clark|Huguette]], and her family, ''[[Empty Mansions|Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune]]'' by [[Bill Dedman]] and Paul Clark Newell, Jr.

===Exterior===
[[File:William A. Clark House - Winter 1905-06.jpg|thumb|[[Fifth Avenue]] and 77th Street in New York City (winter 1905–1906)]]
[[File:Senator William Clark Mansion (ca 1910).jpg|thumb|View from the southwest]]
The house had 250 feet on 77th Street and 77 feet on [[Fifth Avenue]], more than any other rich man on Fifth opposite the park, except for [[Andrew Carnegie]].&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;  The Fifth Avenue front was large for a New York house, with three bays of granite.

On 77th Street, the house featured a long facade rising to a steep [[mansard roof]]. The house featured a spectacular four-sided tower with a three-story-high inward-curving arch topped by an open [[pergola]]&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt; that was said to have been visible from almost anywhere in [[Central Park]].&lt;ref name=Empty&gt;Bill Dedman, Paul Clark Newell, Jr., ''Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune'', New York: Ballantine Books, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior===
The house rose nine stories, with [[Turkish bath]]s below ground level, laundry rooms on the top floor and many Greek marble columns. There was a [[Numidian]] marble fireplace in the banquet room that measured 15&amp;nbsp;ft. across, with life-size figures of Diana and Neptune. The 121 rooms were filled with medieval tapestries and artwork. In the breakfast room, there were 170 carved panels, with no two being identical.&lt;ref name=Dayton&gt;{{cite news|title=The Lost 1908 William A. Clark Mansion|url=http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/03/lost-1908-william-clark-mansion.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=Daytonian in Manhattan|date=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second floor was a [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], 36 feet high, of [[Maryland]] marble with eight Bresche violet marble columns, used as the [[statuary]] room. The room opened onto a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]] of solid brass and glass, 30 feet high and 22 feet wide. Across the rotunda was the marble-paneled main picture gallery, which was 95&amp;nbsp;ft. long and two stories high. An [[Pipe organ|organ]] loft housed the largest chamber organ in America, with 62 “speaking stops.”&lt;ref name=Dayton/&gt;

The ''Salon Doré'', an ornate 18th-century room taken from the Hotel de Clermont in [[Paris, France|Paris]], was installed in the house and served as the receiving room.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite news|title=Lifting the Curtains at Corcoran's Salon Dore|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2001/11/10/lifting-the-curtains-at-corcorans-salon-dore/6e1e3c9b-8fd4-4967-af86-5e6aa2c8982c/|accessdate=7 February 2018|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=November 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 25 guest rooms with their own baths, and 35 servant's rooms, with men’s quarters (to the east) and female rooms (to the west). There was also a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] library that was 90 feet long, featuring a beamed ceiling and an immense carved fireplace.&lt;ref name=Dayton/&gt;

[[William A. Clark|Clark]]'s art collection included works by [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], [[John Constable]], [[François Boucher]] and [[Charles-François Daubigny]]. It was reported that he spent $200,000 ({{Inflation|US|200000|1907|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) for the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelin tapestries]] owned by [[Prince Murat]] and $350,000 ({{Inflation|US|350000|1907|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) for those of the [[Earl of Coventry]].&lt;ref name=Dayton/&gt;

===Demolition===
In 1925, upon Clark's death, his widow and his daughter, [[Huguette Clark]], decamped to [[907 Fifth Avenue]], where the annual rental for a full-floor apartment was about $30,000.&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Christopher|title=Huguette Clark’s ‘Worthless’ Girlhood Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/realestate/huguette-clarks-worthless-girlhood-home.html?_r=1|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the mansion was sold to [[Anthony Campagna]] for $3 million ({{Inflation|US|3000000|1925|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). He had the home torn down in 1927, less than 20 years after it was built.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; It was replaced with the current luxury apartment building at [[960 Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; The ''Salon Doré'' was bequeathed to the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=salon /&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Montgomery Schuyler]], in a column titled "Architectural Aberrations" in ''[[Architectural Record]]'', stated that the house was “an appropriate residence for the late [[P. T. Barnum]].” He felt the tower was “meaningless and fatuous”; the rounded rustication on the first floor suggested the prototype of “a log house.” At the time, the French style had gone out of fashion and the ornamentation was no longer in vogue. Schuyler wrote that “a certified check to the amount of all this stone carving hung on the outer wall would serve every artistic purpose attained by the carving itself.”&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;

The editor of [[Architect (magazine)|The Architect]] called the place “The House of a Thousand Cartouches” and despised the “dolorous and ponderous granite” chosen.&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt; At the time, these opinions were widespread, earning the home the nickname "Clark's Folly".&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

In 2011, however, ''The [[New York Times]]'' architectural critic [[Christopher Gray]] stated the house was, in fact, "a pretty neat house. If [[Carrère &amp; Hastings]] had designed it for an establishment client, its profligacy would certainly have been forgiven, perhaps lionized."&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;

'''Ángel Ramos''' (December 3, 1902 &amp;ndash; September 1, 1960) was the founder of [[Telemundo]], the second largest [[Spanish Language|Spanish-language]] television network in the [[United States]].

==Early years==
Ramos (birth name: '''Ángel Ramos Torres''' &lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Ramos'''|'''Torres'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was born into a poor family in the northern town of [[Manatí, Puerto Rico]]. He was the only son born to Juan Ramón Ramos Vélez and Braulia Torres Giliberty, and only 3 years old when his father died. He was raised by his mother and an aunt, He finished his primary education, however in 1917, when he was 15 years old, he felt that in Manati he didn't have a future and left his home; he then moved to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], the capital city of [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Manati"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071024004226/http://www.manati.info/biografias/ramos/angel_ramos.htm Angel Ramos]&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in San Juan, he went to school at the Central High School and found a job in "El Mundo", a recently founded [[newspaper]].  He started as a typesetter. In 1924, when he was 22 years old, he was promoted to the position of administrator.

=="El Mundo" newspaper==
In 1944, Ramos purchased the newspaper's holding company and thus, became the sole owner and publisher of the newspaper. He met his future wife, an [[Italian people|Italian]] girl by the name of Argentina Schifano while on a business trip to [[New York City]]. After they were married, the couple continued to live in Puerto Rico where Ramos's company was based.&lt;ref name="Manati"/&gt;

Ramos founded WEMB-Radio El Mundo and within a period of two years he purchased another [[radio]] station, [[WKAQ (AM)|WKAQ]], thus establishing "Radio El Mundo" as the number 1 radio station in Puerto Rico which controlled 80% of the total air time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prfrogui.com/goyita/tvihistor.htm History of Puerto Rican television]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telemundo==
In 1954, Ramos founded the first Puerto Rican television station, [[WKAQ-TV]] that was transmitted through Channel 2 and which he named "[[Telemundo]]". Ramos wanted to maintain a consistent branding between his properties using the "mundo" theme ("mundo" is the Spanish word for "world"). Telemundo's first television signal was transmitted on January 28, 1954. On August 22, 1955, Telemundo transmitted the first locally produced "telenovela" ([[soap opera]]), titled "Ante la Ley", which included the participation of the Puerto Rican actress, [[Lucy Boscana]].  Argentina Ramos was active in her husband's newspaper, radio and television companies.  They later set up a network in the former British colony of [[Guyana]], though it was not particularly successful it was an indication of his ambition being carried over into those who followed in his footsteps. Sadly, they failed in their attempt because Spanish was not a common language in that country.&lt;ref name="Telemundo"&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Nt1I3uIwf3MJ:maxpedia.org/cgi-bin/mp/m.pl%3Fla%3Den%26sw%3DTelemundo+Angel+Ramos+Telemundo&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=8&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF-8 Telemundo]&lt;/ref&gt;


==Awards and recognitions==
In 1950, Ramos was the recipient of the María Moors Cabot Award, bestowed upon him by [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;'''''Puerto Rico: Figuras, apuntes históricos, símbolos nacionales''''', por Esther M. Melón de Díaz, 1975, pg. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; That year he was also named ''Citizen of the Year'' by the Puerto Rican Institute in New York. He was the President of the Executive Committee of the Interamerican Press Society.&lt;ref name="Telemundo"/&gt;

==Death and Legacy==
On September 1, 1960, Angel Ramos died in New York City of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. His wife Argentina became the head of El Mundo Enterprises.  She established the [[Angel Ramos Foundation]], which is now the largest private philanthropic foundation in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farpr.org/es/4/23.html Angel Ramos Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Argentina remarried and moved to [[Miami, Florida]].  On April 14, 1983, Telemundo was sold to John Blair and Co. and on October 1987 it passed to the hands of Reliance, Inc; finally, in 2001, Telemundo became part of [[NBC Universal]] and Telemundo is now the second largest Spanish speaking television network in the United States and, through its [[Telemundo Internacional|international channel]], is also seen in most of [[Latin-America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaowners.com/company/nbcuniversal.html NBC Universal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Angel Ramos Foundation provided a matching grant of one half the construction cost of the [[Arecibo Observatory]]'s visitor center which was named after Mr. Ramos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naic.edu/outreach/describe_fset.htm Arecibo Observatory Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center]&lt;/ref&gt;
