The '''Acoustically Navigated Geological Underwater Survey (ANGUS)''' was a deep-towed still-camera [[epibenthic sled|sled]] operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] (WHOI) in the early 1970s. It was the first unmanned research vehicle made by WHOI.&lt;ref name= "WHOI"&gt;“Ships &amp; Technology used during the Titanic Expeditions” Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution March 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ANGUS was encased in a large {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} steel frame designed to explore rugged volcanic terrain and able to withstand high impact collisions.&lt;ref name="Lindop"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lindop, L.|date=2006|title=Venturing the Deep Sea|pages=37–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was fitted with three [[35 mm film|35 mm]] color cameras with {{convert|400|ft|m}} of film. Together, its three cameras were able to photograph a strip of the [[seabed|sea floor]] with a width up to {{convert|200|ft|m}}. Each camera was equipped with strobe lights allowing them to photograph the ocean floor from {{convert|35|to|50|ft|m}} above.&lt;ref name="WHOI"/&gt; On the bottom of the body was a downward-facing [[sonar]] system to monitor the sled's height above the ocean floor.&lt;ref name="WHOI"/&gt; It was capable of working in depths up to {{convert|20000|ft|m}}&lt;ref name="Porteaus"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Porteaus, J.|date=1986|title=VETERAN ANGUS|journal=Oceans|volume=19|issue=1|pages=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could therefore reach roughly 98% of the sea floor.&lt;ref name="WHOI"/&gt; ANGUS could remain in the [[Deep sea|deep ocean]] for work sessions of 12 to 14 hours at a time, taking up to 16,000 photographs in one session.&lt;ref name ="Yount"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yount L.|date=2006|title=Modern Marine Science: Exploring the Deep|pages=133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANGUS was often used to scout locations of interest to later be explored and sampled by other vehicles such as [[Argo (submersible)|''Argo'']] or [[DSV Alvin|''Alvin'']].

ANGUS has been used to search for and photograph underground [[geyser]]s and the creatures living near them, and it was equipped with a heat sensor to alert the tether-ship when it passed over one.&lt;ref name="Porteaus" /&gt; It was used on expeditions such as Project FAMOUS (French-American Mid Ocean Undersea Study 1973–1974), the Discovery expedition with ''Argo'' to survey the wreckage of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']].&lt;ref name="Porteaus" /&gt; (1985), and again in the return mission to the ''Titanic'' (1986). ANGUS was the only [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] used on both dives to the ''Titanic''.

On Project FAMOUS, ANGUS helped change scientists views of the ocean floor. It showed them how different geological formations and chemical compositions of sediments can be, disproving previous assumptions of ocean floor uniformity &lt;ref name="Hammond"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hammond A.|date=1975|title=Project FAMOUS: Exploring the Mid-Atlantic Ridge|journal=Science|volume=187|issue=4179|pages=823–825}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also provided new insight to the theory of [[seafloor spreading]] by observing and sampling the rock formations around ridges and the horizontal formation of layers parallel to the ridge.&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;

In another 1977 expedition with ANGUS, scientists monitored temperatures over the ocean floor for any fluctuation. It was not until late at night the crew noticed temperatures rise drastically. They would review the photograph footage taken after the vehicle's session.&lt;ref name="Lindop"/&gt; ANGUS provided the first photographic evidence for [[hydrothermal vents]] and [[black smokers]].&lt;ref name="Yount"/&gt; It had returned with over 3000 colored photos showing both vents as well as colonies of clams and other organisms.&lt;ref name="Lindop"/&gt; They would later return with [[DSV Alvin|''Alvin'']] to take samples.

Scientists nicknamed ANGUS '''Dope on a rope''' &lt;ref name="Lindop"/&gt; due to its durability and lack of fragile sensors. It was also given the motto "takes a lickin' but it keeps on clickin'". ANGUS was retired in the late 1980s, having completed over 250 voyages.&lt;ref name="WHOI"/&gt;

[[File:Atlantis on Shuttle Carrier Aircraft.jpg|thumb|[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']] on a [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]].]]

'''Aeronautics''' is the science or art involved with the study, [[design process|design]], and manufacturing of air [[flight]] capable machines, and the techniques of operating [[aircraft]] and rockets within the [[atmosphere]]. The British [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] identifies the aspects of "aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering" and "the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics)." &lt;ref&gt;[http://aerosociety.com/About-Us/learnedsociety A Learned and Professional Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209140509/http://aerosociety.com/About-Us/learnedsociety |date=2014-02-09 }} (Retrieved 8 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term originally referred solely to ''operating'' the aircraft, it has since been expanded to include technology, business, and other aspects related to aircraft.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 | title = Aeronautics
 | volume = 1
 | pages = 226
 | year = 1986
 | publisher = Grolier }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term "[[aviation]]" is sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics, although "aeronautics" includes [[lighter-than-air]] craft such as [[airship]]s, and includes [[ballistic vehicle]]s while "aviation" technically does not.&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

A significant part of '''aeronautical science''' is a branch of [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] called [[aerodynamics]], which deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.

==History==

===Early ideas===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci helicopter and lifting wing.jpg|thumb|right|Designs for flying machines by Leonardo da Vinci, circa 1490]]

Attempts  to fly without any real aeronautical understanding have been made from the earliest times, typically by constructing wings and jumping from a tower with crippling or lethal results.{{sfn|Wragg|1974}}

Wiser investigators sought to gain some rational understanding through the study of bird flight. An early example appears in ancient Egyptian texts.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Later medieval Islamic scientists also made such studies. The founders of modern aeronautics, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in the Renaissance and Cayley in 1799, both began their investigations with studies of bird flight.

Man-carrying kites are believed to have been used extensively in ancient China. In 1282 the European explorer [[Marco Polo]] described the Chinese techniques then current.&lt;ref name="pelham"&gt;Pelham, D.; ''The Penguin book of kites'', Penguin (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese also constructed small hot air balloons, or lanterns, and rotary-wing toys.

An early European to provide any scientific discussion of flight was [[Roger Bacon]], who described principles of operation for the lighter-than-air [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] and the flapping-wing [[ornithopter]], which he envisaged would be constructed in the future. The lifting medium for his balloon would be an "aether" whose composition he did not know.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|pp=10–11}}

In the late fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci followed up his study of birds with designs for some of the earliest flying machines, including the flapping-wing [[ornithopter]] and the rotating-wing [[helicopter]]. Although his designs were rational, they were not based on particularly good science.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|p=11}} Many of his designs, such as a four-person screw-type helicopter, have severe flaws. He did at least understand that "An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object."{{sfn|Fairlie|Cayley|1965|p=163}} ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]] would not publish the [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|Third law of motion]] until 1687.) His analysis led to the realisation that manpower alone was not sufficient for sustained flight, and his later designs included a mechanical power source such as a spring. Da Vinci's work was lost after his death and did not reappear until it had been overtaken by the work of [[George Cayley]].

===Balloon flight===
{{Main article|History of ballooning}}
[[File:Flying boat.png|thumb|right|upright|Francesco Lana de Terzi's flying boat concept c.1670]]
The modern era of lighter-than-air flight began early in the 17th century with [[Galileo]]'s experiments in which he showed that air has weight. Around 1650 [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] wrote some fantasy novels in which he described the principle of ascent using a substance (dew) he supposed to be lighter than air, and descending by releasing a controlled amount of the substance.{{sfn|Ege|1973|p=6}} [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] measured the pressure of air at sea level and in 1670 proposed the first scientifically credible lifting medium in the form of hollow metal spheres from which all the air had been pumped out. These would be lighter than the displaced air and able to lift an [[airship]]. His proposed methods of controlling height are still in use today; by carrying ballast which may be dropped overboard to gain height, and by venting the lifting containers to lose height.{{sfn|Ege|1973|p=7}} In practice de Terzi's spheres would have collapsed under air pressure, and further developments had to wait for more practicable lifting gases.
[[File:Montgolfier brothers flight.jpg|thumb|Montgolfier brothers flight, 1784]]
From the mid-18th century the [[Montgolfier brothers]] in France began experimenting with balloons. Their balloons were made of paper, and early experiments using steam as the lifting gas were short-lived due to its effect on the paper as it condensed. Mistaking smoke for a kind of steam, they began filling their balloons with hot smoky air which they called "electric smoke" and, despite not fully understanding the principles at work, made some successful launches and in 1783 were invited to give a demonstration to the French ''Académie des Sciences''.

Meanwhile, the discovery of [[hydrogen]] led [[Joseph Black]] in c. 1780 to propose its use as a lifting gas, though practical demonstration awaited a gas tight balloon material. On hearing of the Montgolfier Brothers' invitation, the French Academy member [[Jacques Charles]] offered a similar demonstration of a hydrogen balloon. Charles and two craftsmen, the Robert brothers, developed a gas tight material of rubberised silk for the envelope. The hydrogen gas was to be generated by chemical reaction during the filling process.

The Montgolfier designs had several shortcomings, not least the need for dry weather and a tendency for sparks from the fire to set light to the paper balloon. The manned design had a gallery around the base of the balloon rather than the hanging basket of the first, unmanned design, which brought the paper closer to the fire. On their free flight, De Rozier and d'Arlandes took buckets of water and sponges to douse these fires as they arose. On the other hand, the manned design of Charles was essentially modern.{{sfn|Ege|1973|pp=97–100}} As a result of these exploits, the hot-air balloon became known as the ''Montgolfière'' type and the hydrogen balloon the ''Charlière''.

Charles and the Robert brothers' next balloon, ''[[Robert brothers#Further ballooning activities – La Caroline|La Caroline]]'', was a Charlière that followed [[Jean Baptiste Meusnier]]'s proposals for an elongated dirigible balloon, and was notable for having an outer envelope with the gas contained in a second, inner ballonet. On 19 September 1784, it completed the first flight of over 100&amp;nbsp;km, between Paris and [[Beuvry]], despite the man-powered propulsive devices proving useless.

In an attempt the next year to provide both endurance and controllability, de Rozier developed a balloon having both hot air and hydrogen gas bags, a design which was soon named after him as the ''Rozière.'' The principle was to use the hydrogen section for constant lift and to navigate vertically by heating and allowing to cool the hot air section, in order to catch the most favourable wind at whatever altitude it was blowing. The balloon envelope was made of [[goldbeaters skin|goldbeater's skin]]. The first flight ended in disaster and the approach has seldom been used since.{{sfn|Ege|1965|p=105}}

===Cayley and the foundation of modern aeronautics===
[[Sir George Cayley]] (1773-1857) is widely acknowledged as the founder of modern aeronautics. He was first called the "father of the aeroplane" in 1846{{sfn|Fairlie|Cayley|1965}} and Henson called him the "father of aerial navigation."{{sfn|Wragg|1974}} He was the first true scientific aerial investigator to publish his work, which included for the first time the underlying principles and forces of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Sir George Carley| url = http://www.flyingmachines.org/cayl.html| publisher = Flyingmachines.org| accessdate = 2009-07-26| quote = Sir George Cayley is one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics. Many consider him the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight.| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090211164945/http://flyingmachines.org/cayl.html| archivedate = 2009-02-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809 he began the publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled "On Aerial Navigation" (1809–1810).&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;''Cayley, George''. "On Aerial Navigation" [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf Part 1]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511071413/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf Part 2]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511041814/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf Part 3]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511052409/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }} ''Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy'', 1809–1810. (Via [[NASA]]). [http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/i/Cayley/Cayley.html Raw text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193751/http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/i/Cayley/Cayley.html |date=2016-03-03 }}. Retrieved: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, "The whole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air." He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: ''[[thrust]]'', ''[[Lift (force)|lift]]'', ''[[Aerodynamic drag|drag]]'' and ''[[weight]]'' and distinguished stability and control in his designs.

He developed the modern conventional form of the fixed-wing aeroplane having a stabilising tail with both horizontal and vertical surfaces, flying gliders both unmanned and manned.

He introduced the use of the whirling arm test rig to investigate the aerodynamics of flight, using it to discover the benefits of the curved or [[camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] [[aerofoil]] over the flat wing he had used for his first glider. He also identified and described the importance of [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and design of [[ornithopter]]s and [[parachute]]s.{{sfn|Wragg|1974}}

Another significant invention was the tension-spoked wheel, which he devised in order to create a light, strong wheel for aircraft undercarriage.

===The 19th century===
During the 19th century Cayley's ideas were refined, proved and expanded on. Important investigators included [[Otto Lilienthal]] and [[Horatio Phillips]].

===The 20th century===

Pedro Paulet, scientist born in the city of Arequipa, Peru in the year of 1874, was one of the first to experiment with propulsion rockets being considered the «Father of Modern Rocket» and by others as the «Father of Aeronautics Modern ». He developed plans for a "torpedo plane", which is why he is considered ahead of his time. When the internal explosion engines were invented, small enough to be able to propel a flying device with them, a race started between two flight possibilities: the lighter than the air (dirigibles) and the heavier than the air (aeroplanes) .

Aeronautics may be divided into three main branches comprising [[Aviation]], [[Aeronautical science]] and [[Aeronautical engineering]].

===Aviation===
{{Main article|Aviation}}

Aviation is the art or practice of aeronautics. Historically aviation meant only heavier-than-air flight, but nowadays it includes flying in balloons and airships.

===Aeronautical science===

Aeronautical science covers the practical theory of aeronautics and aviation, including operations, navigation, air safety and human factors.

A candidate pilot is likely to study for a qualification in aeronautical science.

===Aeronautical engineering===
{{Main article|Aerospace engineering}}

Aeronautical engineering covers the design and construction of aircraft, including how they are powered, how they are used and how they are controlled for safe operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/aeronauticalengineering/ Aeronautical engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727050235/http://www.gla.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/aeronauticalengineering/ |date=2012-07-27 }}, University of Glasgow.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major part of aeronautical engineering is [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamics]], the science of passing through the air.

With the increasing activity in space flight, nowadays aeronautics and astronautics are often combined as [[aerospace engineering]].

==== Aerodynamics ====
{{Main article|Aerodynamics}}
The science of aerodynamics deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.

The study of aerodynamics falls broadly into three areas:

''[[Incompressible flow]]'' occurs where the air simply moves to avoid objects, typically at subsonic speeds below that of sound (Mach 1).

''[[Compressible flow]]'' occurs where shock waves appear at points where the air becomes compressed, typically at speeds above Mach 1.

''[[Transonic flow]]'' occurs in the intermediate speed range around Mach 1, where the airflow over an object may be locally subsonic at one point and locally supersonic at another.

=== Rocketry ===
{{See also|Rocket}}
[[File:Apollo 15 launch.ogv|thumb|right|Launch of [[Apollo 15]] [[Saturn V]] rocket: ''T'' - 30 s through ''T'' + 40 s.]]

A [[rocket]] or rocket vehicle is a [[missile]], spacecraft, [[aircraft]] or other [[vehicle]] which obtains [[thrust]] from a [[rocket engine]]. In all rockets, the exhaust is formed entirely from [[propellant]]s carried within the rocket before use.&lt;ref name="RPE7"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sutton | first = George | title = Rocket Propulsion Elements |edition=7th |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-32642-7|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocket engines work by [[Reaction (physics)|action and reaction]]. Rocket engines push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast.

Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th-century [[China]].&lt;ref name="NASA EARLY"&gt;{{harvnb|MSFC History Office}} "Rockets in Ancient Times (100 B.C. to 17th Century)"&lt;/ref&gt; Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology of the [[Space Age]], including [[Apollo 11|setting foot on the moon]].

Rockets are used for [[fireworks]], weaponry, [[ejection seat]]s, [[launch vehicle]]s for [[artificial satellite]]s, [[human spaceflight]] and [[Space exploration|exploration]] of other planets. While comparatively inefficient for low speed use, they are very lightweight and powerful, capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining [[escape velocity|extremely high speeds]] with reasonable efficiency.

[[Chemical rocket]]s are the most common type of rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of [[rocket propellant]]. Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.

'''Akshuat dendropark''' (Russian: [[Акшуатский дендропарк]]) is a [[natural monument]] ([[Protected areas of Ulyanovsk Oblast]])

==Basic special features==

There are a lot of exotic rocks of trees in this Protected Area (above 70 nowadays). All trees are fertile. Examples of the species-exotics: the larch of Sukachev, the pine tree of Veymutov, fir tree is Siberian, juniper, maggoniya.
Not the sanitary felling of forest is forbidden in the territory. Researching and scientific work presented. There are places of the rest and a sport camp.

==The basis for creation of the protected area and its importance==

Unique assembly of trees and bushes from the different countries of the world (it is more than 150 kinds), landed in the middle of 19th century in V.N.Polivanova's manor. It was created as nursery of coniferous breeds for protection of farmland against sandy drifts.

[[File:All story weekly 19140404.jpg|thumb|''At The Earth's Core'' was serialized in ''All Story Weekly'' in 1914.]]
'''''At the Earth's Core''''' is a 1914 [[fantasy]] novel by American writer [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the first in his series about the fictional "[[hollow earth]]" land of [[Pellucidar]]. It first appeared as a four-part serial in ''[[All-Story Weekly]]'' from April 4–25, 1914. It was first published in book form in hardcover by A. C. McClurg in July, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.erbzine.com/mag7/0741.html |title=At the Earth's Core |work=ERB C.H.A.S.E.R Encyclopedia |publisher=ERBzine |volume=0741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The author relates how, traveling in the [[Sahara|Sahara desert]], he has encountered a remarkable vehicle and its pilot, [[David Innes]], a man with a remarkable story to tell.

David Innes is a mining heir who finances the experimental "iron mole," an excavating vehicle designed by his elderly inventor friend Abner Perry. In a test run, they discover the vehicle cannot be turned, and it burrows 500 miles into the Earth's crust, emerging into the unknown interior world of Pellucidar. In Burroughs' concept, the Earth is a hollow shell with Pellucidar as the internal surface of that shell.

Pellucidar is inhabited by prehistoric creatures of all geological eras, and dominated by the Mahars, a species of flying reptile both intelligent and civilized, but which enslaves and preys on the local stone-age humans. Innes and Perry are captured by the Mahars' ape-like Sagoth servants and taken with other human captives to the chief Mahar city of Phutra. Among their fellow captives are the brave Ghak, the Hairy One, from the country of Sari, the shifty Hooja the Sly One and the lovely Dian the Beautiful of Amoz.

David Innes, attracted to Dian the Beautiful, defends her against the unwanted attentions of Hooja the Sly One, but due to his ignorance of local customs she assumes he wants her as a slave, not a friend or lover, and subsequently snubs him. Only later, after Hooja slips their captors in a dark tunnel and forces Dian to leave with him, does David learn from Ghak the cause of the misunderstanding.

[[Image:ATEC1962.jpg|left|thumb|First paperback edition of ''At the Earth's Core'', 1962. Cover by [[Roy Krenkel]].]]

In Phutra the captives become slaves, and the two surface worlders learn more of Pellucidar and Mahar society. The Mahars are all female, reproducing [[Parthenogenesis|parthogenetically]] by means of a closely guarded "Great Secret" contained in a Mahar book. David learns that they also feast on selected human captives in a secret ritual. In a disturbance, David manages to escape Phutra, becomes lost, and experiences a number of adventures before sneaking back into the city. Rejoining Abner, he finds the latter did not even realize he was gone, and the two discover that time in Pellucidar, in the absence of objective means to measure it, is a subjective thing, experienced by different people at different rates.

Obsessed with righting the wrong he has unwittingly done Dian, David Innes escapes again and eventually finds and wins her by defeating the malevolent Jubal the Ugly One, another unwanted suitor. David makes amends, and he and Dian wed.

Later, along with Ghak and other allies, David Innes and Abner Perry lead a revolt of humankind against the cruel Mahars. Their foes are hampered by the loss of the Great Secret, which David has stolen and hidden. To further the struggle David returns to the Iron Mole, in which he and Dian propose to travel back to the surface world to procure outer world technology. Only after it is underway does he discover that Hooja the Sly One has substituted a drugged Mahar for Dian the Beautiful.

Back in the world we know David meets the author, who after hearing his tale and seeing his prehistoric captive, helps him resupply and prepare the mole for the return to Pellucidar.

==Critical reception==
''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' reviewer [[Floyd C. Gale]], discussing the 1962 paperback edition, praised the novel; he said that "Burroughs's concepts are intriguing and his combat scenes gripping." Gale faulted the novel's style, noting that "the reader must wade at least twenty-five pages into the book before he can cease to be annoyed by the author's stilted and florid style", but promised that "by then he has reached the point of no return".&lt;ref name="gale196306"&gt;{{Cite magazine

==Adaptations==
The novel was filmed as ''[[At the Earth's Core (film)|At the Earth's Core]]'' (1976), directed by [[Kevin Connor (director)|Kevin Connor]] and starring [[Doug McClure]] as David Innes and [[Peter Cushing]] as Abner Perry.

When [[DC Comics]] gained the license to adapt the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, they managed to adapt the first Pellucidar book, with [[Len Wein]] scripting, and various artists such as [[Mike Kaluta]] and [[Murphy Anderson]] on art. The adaptation started out ''Korak, Son of Tarzan'' #46, then moved to ''Weird Worlds'', where it ran from #1-6.

The 2008 movie ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008 Asylum film)|Journey to Middle Earth]]'' also shares several similarities with the events and locations of the novel, although the film was intended as a loose adaptation of ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' by [[Jules Verne]].

==Legacy==
Other authors have been inspired by Burroughs' depiction of the strange subterranean world, most notably [[H.P. Lovecraft]] whose ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' was heavily influenced by ''At the Earth's Core'', particularly in the name of the [[Elder Things]]' slave race, the [[Shoggoths]].&lt;ref&gt;William Fulwiler, "E.R.B. and H.P.L.", ''Black Forbidden Things'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Another and more direct homage to Burroughs' concept is [[Lin Carter]]'s "Zanthodon" series, beginning with his novel ''[[Journey to the Underground World]]''.

Prolific [[manga]] artist [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] also loosely adapted the book for the final story arc of the original ''[[Cyborg 009]]'' manga.

The '''Atlantic semi-deciduous forests''', also known as the '''Atlantic interior forests''', are a belt of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forests]] that are part of the [[Atlantic Forests]] complex of eastern [[Brazil]]. The semi-deciduous forests form a transitional zone between the humid [[Atlantic moist forests]] which lie near the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, and the drier [[Caatinga]] shrublands, [[Atlantic dry forests]], and [[Cerrado]] savannas of the interior.

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] divides the semi-deciduous forests into three distinct ecoregions. The [[Pernambuco interior forests]] lie west of the [[Pernambuco coastal forests]] in [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Paraíba]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Alagoas]], and [[Sergipe]] states. The [[Bahia interior forests]] lie west of the [[Bahia coastal forests]] in [[Bahia]], [[Minas Gerais]], and [[Espírito Santo]] states. The [[Paraná-Paraíba interior forests]], also known as the Alta Paraná Atlantic forests, lie inland from the [[Serra do Mar coastal forests]], extending inland across the Brazilian states of [[Rio de Janeiro State|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[São Paulo State|São Paulo]], [[Goiás]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Paraná State|Paraná]], [[Santa Catarina State|Santa Catarina]], and [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the Argentinian province of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], and eastern [[Paraguay]].

An '''Australian tropical cyclone''' is a non [[weather front|frontal]], [[Low-pressure area|low pressure system]] that has developed, within an environment of warm [[sea surface temperature]]s and little vertical [[wind shear]] aloft in either the Southern [[Indian Ocean]] or the South [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name="SPAC TCOP"&gt;{{cite report|author=RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |type=Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan for the South-East Indian Ocean and the Southern Pacific Ocean 2014 |date=May 5, 2015 |pages=2B-1–2B-4 (23–26) |format=PDF |url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP24_RAVOpPlan_2014_final.pdf |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |title=List of Tropical Cyclone Names withdrawn from use due to a Cyclone's Negative Impact on one or more countries |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YlsJ3Q48?url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP24_RAVOpPlan_2014_final.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2015 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Southern Hemisphere there are officially three areas where tropical cyclones develop on a regular basis, these areas are the South-West Indian Ocean between Africa and 90°E, the Australian region between 90°E and 160°E and the South Pacific basin between 160°E and 120°W. The Australian region between 90°E and 160°E is officially monitored by the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]], the Papua New Guinea National Weather Service and the [[Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics]], while others like the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] and the United States [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] also monitor the basin. Each tropical cyclone year within this basin starts on July 1 and runs throughout the year, encompassing the tropical cyclone season which runs from November 1 and lasts until April 30 each season. Within the basin, most tropical cyclones have their origins within the [[South Pacific Convergence Zone]] or within the Northern Australian monsoon trough, both of which form an extensive area of cloudiness and are dominant features of the season. Within this region a tropical disturbance is classified as a tropical cyclone, when it has 10-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65&amp;nbsp;km/h (35&amp;nbsp;mph), that wrap halfway around the low level circulation centre, while a severe tropical cyclone is classified when the maximum 10-minute sustained wind speeds are greater than 120&amp;nbsp;km/h (75&amp;nbsp;mph).

==Basin history==
There is a history of tropical cyclones affecting northeastern Australia for over 5000 years; however, [[Clement Lindley Wragge]] was the first person to monitor and name them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412003002009 | title=Palaeotempestology: the study of prehistoric tropical cyclones—a review and implications for hazard assessment | first=Jonathon | last=Nott | publisher=Science Direct | date=14 November 2003 | accessdate=14 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early history of tropical cyclones in the Australian region, the only evidence of a storm was based on ship reports and observations from land. Later, satellite imagery began in the basin in the 1959/60 season, although it was not continuous until 1970. In Western Australia in particular, the lack of population centers, shipping lanes, radars, and offshore stations meant that storms were tracked infrequently. After the onset of satellite imagery, the [[Dvorak technique]] was used to estimate storm's intensities and locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=The Impact of Tropical Cyclone Olivia on Australia's Northwest Shelf|conference=Offshore Technology Conference|author=S.J. Buchan|author2=P.G. Black|author3=R.L. Cohen|year=1999|accessdate=January 14, 2016|url=http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/2010/olivia.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Australian region is currently defined as being between 90E and 160E and is monitored by five different warning centres during the season that runs from 1 November to 30 April. Three of the warning centres are.

A '''cave survey''' is a [[map]] of all or part of a [[cave]] system, which may be produced to meet differing standards of accuracy depending on the cave conditions and equipment available underground. Cave surveying and [[cartography]], i.e. the creation of an accurate, detailed map, is one of the most common technical activities undertaken within a cave and is a fundamental part of [[speleology]]. Surveys can be used to compare caves to each other by length, depth and volume, may reveal clues on [[speleogenesis]], provide a spatial reference for other areas of scientific study and assist visitors with route-finding.

Traditionally, cave surveys are produced in two-dimensional form due to the confines of print, but given the three-dimensional environment inside a cave, modern techniques using [[computer aided design]] are increasingly used to allow a more realistic representation of a cave system.

==History==
[[File:Marble Arch Survey (Brodrick, H., 1908).png|thumb|right|1908 survey of [[Marble Arch Caves]] by the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club|alt=Hand-drawn map of a cave, showing meandering underground river passage as well as surface topography including large shakeholes.]]
The first known plan of a cave dates from 1546, and was of a man-made cavern in tufa called the Stufe di Nerone (Nero's Oven) in [[Pozzuoli]] near [[Naples]] in Italy. The first natural cave to be mapped was the [[Baumann's Cave|Baumannshöhle]] in [[Germany]], of which a sketch from 1656 survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Encyclopedia of Caves and Karst Science |last= Gunn |first=J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2003 |publisher= Routledge|location= |isbn= 978-1-57958-399-6|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early survey dates from before 1680, and was made by [[John Aubrey]] of Long Hole in the [[Cheddar Gorge]]. It consists of an elevational section of the cave. Numerous other surveys of caves were made in the following years, though most are sketches and are limited in accuracy. The first cave that is likely to have been accurately surveyed with instruments is the [[Grotte de Miremont]] in [[France]]. This was surveyed by a civil engineer in 1765 and includes numerous cross-sections. [[Édouard-Alfred Martel]] was the first person to describe surveying techniques. His surveys were made by having an assistant walk down the passage until they were almost out of sight. Martel would then take a compass bearing to the assistant's light, and measure the distance by pacing up to the assistant. This would equate to a modern-day BCRA Grade 2 survey.

The first cave to have its centreline calculated by a computer is the Fergus River Cave in [[Ireland]], which was plotted by members of the [[UBSS]] in 1964. The software was programmed onto a large university mainframe computer and a paper plot was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nicholson |first1= F.H.|last2=Patmore |first2=D.J. |year= 1965 |title= The Fergus RIver Cave, Co. Clare, Ireland |journal= UBSS Proceedings |volume= 10|issue= 3|page= 285|publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
There are many variations to [[surveying]] methodology, but most are based on a similar set of steps which haven't changed fundamentally in 250 years, although the instruments (compass and tape) have got smaller and more accurate. Since the late 1990s digital instruments such as [[distometers]] have started to change the process, leading to the advent of fully paperless surveying around 2007. The main variation on the normal methodology detailed below have been devices such as LIDAR and SONAR surveyors that produce a point cloud rather than a series of linked stations. Video-based surveying also exists in prototype form.

=== Surveying ===
A survey team begins at a fixed point (such as the cave entrance) and measures a series of consecutive [[sightline|line-of-sight]] measurements between stations. The stations are temporary fixed locations chosen chiefly for their ease of access and clear sight along the cave passage. In some cases, survey stations may be permanently marked to create a fixed reference point to which to return at a later date.

The measurements taken between the stations include:
* direction ([[azimuth]] or [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]]) taken with a [[compass]]
* inclination from horizontal (dip) taken with a [[clinometer]]
* distance measured with a low-stretch tape or [[laser rangefinder]]
* optionally, distance to surrounding walls&amp;nbsp;– left, right, up, down (''LRUD'')

Coincident with recording straight-line data, details of passage dimensions, shape, gradual or sudden changes in elevation, the presence or absence of still or flowing water, the location of notable features and the material on the floor are recorded, often by means of a sketch map.

=== Drawing a line-plot ===
Later, the [[cartographer]] analyses the recorded data, converting them into two-dimensional measurements by way of [[geometry|geometrical]] calculations. From them he/she creates a ''line-plot''; a scaled geometrical representation of the path through the cave.

=== Finalising ===
The cartographer then draws details around the line-plot, using the additional data of passage dimensions, water flow and floor/wall [[topography]] recorded at the time, to produce a completed cave survey. Cave surveys drawn on paper are often presented in two-dimensional ''plan'' and/or ''profile'' views, while computer surveys may simulate three dimensions. Although primarily designed to be functional, some [[caver]]s consider cave surveys as an art form.{{Who|date=December 2011}}

== Hydrolevelling ==
Hydrolevelling is an alternative to measuring depth with clinometer and tape that has a long history of use in Russia.&lt;ref name=compass-points-200707-hydro&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Degtjarev |first1=Alexander  |last2=Snetkov |first2=Eugene |last3=Gurjanov |first3=Alexey |title=Obtaining accurate cave depths by hydrolevelling |journal=Compass Points |publisher=[[British Cave Research Association|BCRA]] Cave Survey Group |issue=38 |date=July 2007 |pages=8–12 |url=http://www.chaos.org.uk/survex/cp/CP38/CP38.pdf |format=PDF |issn=1361-8962 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is regularly used in building construction for finding two points with the same height, as in levelling a floor. In the simplest case, a tube with both ends open is used, attached to a strip of wood, and the tube is filled with water and the depth at each end marked. In Russia, measuring the depth of caves by hydrolevelling began in the 1970s, and was considered to be the most accurate means of measuring depth despite the difficulties in using the cumbersome equipment of the time. Interest in the method has been revived following the discovery of [[Voronya Cave|Voronja]] on the [[Arabica Massif]] in the [[Caucasus]]&amp;nbsp;– currently the world's deepest cave.

The hydrolevel device used in recent Voronja expeditions comprises a {{convert|50|m|ft|sing=on}} transparent tube filled with water, which is coiled or placed on a reel. A rubber glove which acts as a reservoir is placed on one end of the tube, and a metal box with a transparent window is placed on the other. A diver's digital wristwatch with a depth gauge function is submerged in the box. If the rubber glove is placed on one station and the box with the depth gauge is placed on a lower one, then the hydrostatic pressure between the two points depends only on the difference in heights and the density of the water, i.e. the route of the tube does not affect the pressure in the box. Reading the depth gauge gives the apparent depth change between the higher and lower station. Depth changes are 'apparent' because depth gauges are calibrated for sea water, and the hydrolevel is filled with fresh water. Therefore, a coefficient must be determined to convert apparent depth changes to true depth changes. Adding the readings for consecutive pairs of stations gives the total depth of the cave.&lt;ref name=compass-points-200707-hydro /&gt;

== Accuracy ==
The accuracy, or ''grade'', of a cave survey is dependent on the methodology of measurement. A common survey grading system is that created by the [[British Cave Research Association]] in the 1960s, which uses a scale of six grades.&lt;ref name=BCRA-grades&gt;{{cite web |title=BCRA Surveying Grades |publisher=[[British Cave Research Association]] |url=http://www.bcra.org.uk/surveying/ |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BCRA grading system ===

==== BCRA gradings for a cave line survey ====
; Grade 1
: Sketch of low accuracy where no measurements have been made
; Grade 2 (use only if necessary, see note 7)
: May be used, if necessary, to describe a sketch that is intermediate in accuracy between Grade 1 &amp; 3
; Grade 3
:A rough magnetic survey. Horizontal &amp; vertical angles measured to ±2.5&amp;nbsp;°; distances measured to ±50&amp;nbsp;cm; station position error less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm.
;Grade 4 (use only if necessary, see note 7)
:May be used, if necessary, to describe a survey that fails to attain all the requirements of Grade 5 but is more accurate than a Grade 3 survey.
;Grade 5
:A Magnetic survey. Horizontal and vertical angles measured to ±1&amp;nbsp;°; distances should be observed and recorded to the nearest centimetre and station positions identified to less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm.
;Grade 6
:A magnetic survey that is more accurate than grade 5, (see note 5).
;Grade X
:A survey that is based primarily on the use of a theodolite or total station instead of a compass, (see notes 6 and 10 below).

===== Notes =====
# The above table is a summary, omitting some technical details and definitions; the definitions of the survey grades given above must be read in conjunction with these notes.
# In all cases it is necessary to follow the spirit of the definition and not just the letter.
# To attain Grade 3 it is necessary to use a clinometer in passages having appreciable slope.
# To attain Grade 5 it is essential for instruments to be properly calibrated, and all measurements must be taken from a point within a 10&amp;nbsp;cm diameter sphere centred on the survey station.
# A Grade 6 survey requires the compass to be used at the limit of possible accuracy, i.e. accurate to ±0.5&amp;nbsp;°; clinometer readings must be to the same accuracy. Station position error must be less than ±2.5&amp;nbsp;cm, which will require the use of tripods at all stations or other fixed station markers ('roofhooks').
# A Grade X survey must include on the drawing notes descriptions of the instruments and techniques used, together with an estimate of the probable accuracy of the survey compared with Grade 3, 5 or 6 surveys.
# Grades 2 and 4 are for use only when, at some stage of the survey, physical conditions have prevented the survey from attaining all the requirements for the next higher grade and it is not practical to re-survey.
# Caving organisations, etc., are encouraged to reproduce Table 1 and Table 2 in their own publications; permission is not required from BCRA to do so, but the tables must not be reprinted without these notes.
# Grade X is only potentially more accurate than Grade 6. It should never be forgotten that the theodolite/Total Station is a complex precision instrument that requires considerable training and regular practice if serious errors are not to be made through its use!
# In drawing up, the survey co-ordinates must be calculated and not hand-drawn with scale rule and protractor to obtain Grade 5.

==== BCRA gradings for recording cave passage detail ====
;Class A
:All passage details based on memory.
;Class B
:Passage details estimated and recorded in the cave.
;Class C
:Measurements of detail made at survey stations only.
;Class D
:Measurements of detail made at survey stations and wherever else needed to show significant changes in passage dimensions.

===== Notes =====
# The accuracy of the detail should be similar to the accuracy of the line.
# Normally only one of the following combinations of survey grades should be used: 
#* 1A
#* 3B or 3C
#* 5C or 5D
#* 6D 
#* XA, XB, XC or XD

=== Survey error detection ===
The equipment used to undertake a cave survey continues to improve. The use of computers, inertia systems, and electronic distance finders has been proposed, but few practical underground applications have evolved at present.

Despite these advances, faulty instruments, imprecise measurements, recording errors or other factors may still result in an inaccurate survey, and these errors are often difficult to detect. Some cave surveyors measure each station twice, recording a ''back-sight'' to the previous station in the opposite direction. A back-sight compass reading that is different by 180&amp;nbsp;degrees and a clinometer reading that is the same value but with the reverse direction (positive rather than negative, for example) indicates that the original measurement was accurate.

When a loop within a cave is surveyed back to its starting point, the resulting line-plot should also form a closed loop. Any gap between the first and last stations is called a ''loop-closure error''. If no single error is apparent, one may assume the loop-closure error is due to cumulative inaccuracies, and cave survey software can 'close the loop' by averaging possible errors throughout the loop stations. Loops to test survey accuracy may also be made by surveying across the surface between multiple entrances to the same cave.

The use of a low-frequency cave radio can also verify survey accuracy. A receiving unit on the surface can pinpoint the depth and location of a transmitter in a cave passage by measurement of the geometry of its radio waves. A survey over the surface from the receiver back to the cave entrance forms an artificial loop with the underground survey, whose loop-closure error can then be determined.

In the past, cavers were reluctant to redraw complex cave maps after detecting survey errors. Today, computer cartography can automatically redraw cave maps after data has been corrected.

== Surveying software ==
There are a large number of surveying packages available on various computer platforms, most of which have been developed by cavers with a basis in computer programming. Many of the packages perform particularly well for specific tasks, and as such many cave surveyors will not solely choose one product over another for all cartographic tasks.

A popular program for producing a centerline survey is [[Survex]], which was originally developed by members of the Cambridge University Caving Club for processing survey data from club expeditions to Austria. It was released to the public in 1992. The centerline data can then be exported in various formats and the cave detail drawn in with various other programmes such as [[AutoCAD]], [[Adobe Illustrator]] and [[Inkscape]]. Other programmes such as 'Tunnel' and [[Therion (software)|Therion]] have full centerline and map editing capabilities. Therion notably, when it closes survey loops, warps the passages to fit over their length, meaning that entire passages  do not have to be redrawn.

Terrestrial LiDAR units are increasing significantly in accuracy and decreasing in price.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Several Caves have been "scanned" using both "time of flight" and "phase shift" LiDAR units.  The differences are in the relative accuracies available to each.  The Oregon Caves National Park, was LiDAR scanned in August 2011, as were the Paisley Caves Archaeological dig sigte in SE Oregon.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Both were scanned with a FARO Focus Phase shift scanner with +/-2mm accuracy.  The Oregon Caves were scanned from the main public entrance to the 110 exit and were loop surveyed to the point of beginning.  The data is not yet available for public use, but copies are retained by both the US Park Service and i-TEN Associates in Portland, Oregon.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Automated methods==
In recent years an underground geographic positioning technology called [[HORTA (mining)|HORTA]] has been utilized in the [[mining]] industry.  The technology utilizes a [[gyroscope]] and an [[accelerometer]] to aid in [[three-dimensional|3D]]-position determination.&lt;ref name=cmj2000&gt;
[http://www.canadianminingjournal.com/issues/story.aspx?aid=1000110318&amp;type=Print%20Archives Inco's Innovations], ''Canadian Mining Journal'', April 2000, accessed 2010-12-02. ''"HORTA unit for determining the geographic position underground. HORTA-Honeywell Ore Retrieval and Tunneling Aid-is a box containing a gyro and an accelerometer, originally developed for the U.S. military, that solves the problem of positioning and location underground."&lt;/ref&gt;

Such automated methods have provided a more than fifty-fold increase in underground surveying productivity with more accurate and finer detail maps as well.&lt;ref name=cmj2000/&gt;

'''''Citrus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant|flowering]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s in the [[rue]] family, [[Rutaceae]]. Plants in the genus produce '''citrus fruits''', including important [[crop]]s like [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[lemon]]s, [[grapefruit]], [[pomelo]] and [[lime (fruit)|limes]].

The most recent research indicates an origin in the Himalayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu GA, Terol J, Ibanez V, López-García A, Pérez-Román E, Borredá C, Domingo C, Tadeo FR, Carbonell-Caballero J, Alonso R, Curk F, Du D, Ollitrault P, Roose ML, Dopazo J, Gmitter FG, Rokhsar DS, Talon M |title=Genomics of the origin and evolution of Citrus |journal=Nature |volume=554 |issue=7692 |pages=311–316 |date=February 2018 |pmid=29414943 |doi=10.1038/nature25447 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research indicated an origin in the part of [[Southeast Asia]] bordered by [[Northeast India]], [[Burma]] (Myanmar) and the [[Yunnan]] province of [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gmitter | first1 = Frederick | last2 = Hu | first2 = Xulan | year = 1990 | title = The possible role of Yunnan, China, in the origin of contemporary ''Citrus'' species (Rutaceae) | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/vp0u360m6471488t | journal = Economic Botany | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 267–277 | doi=10.1007/bf02860491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

Citrus fruit has been cultivated in an ever-widening area since ancient times.
It has also been cultivated for the production and consumption of [[citrus juice]].
== History ==
Citrus plants are native to subtropical and tropical regions of Asia and the Malay Archipelago and they were first domesticated in these areas. Some citrus species have been present in the Mediterranean basin for centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This group of species has reached great importance in some of the Mediterranean countries and, in the case of orange, mandarin and lemon trees, they found here soil and climatic conditions which allows them to achieve a high level of fruit quality, even better than in the regions where they came from.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The "native" oranges of Florida actually originated with the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcit.usf.edu/florida/docs/f/fruit.htm University of South Florida: Fruit]&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to general belief, the orange tree is not indigenous to Florida but was introduced into the state from Valencia by the Spanish colonists.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tytyga.com/History-of-the-Citrus-and-Citrus-Tree-Growing-in-America-a/381.htm History of the Citrus and Citrus Tree Growing in America]&lt;br /&gt;Many of these wild orange groves were seen by the early American explorer, William Bartram, according to his book, Travels, in 1773, while traveling down the Saint John’s River in Florida. Bartram mistakenly thought these orange trees were native to Florida; however, they were established centuries earlier by the Spanish explorers.&lt;/ref&gt; The agronomists of [[classical Rome]] already made many references to the cultivation of citrus fruits within the limits of their empire.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Duarte |first1=A. |last2=Fernandes |first2=J. |last3=Bernardes |first3=J. |last4=Miguel |first4=G.|date=2016|title=Citrus as a Component of the Mediterranean Diet|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311911612|journal=Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics|volume=4|pages=289–304|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Louis XIV of France housed citrus in orangeries, to protect the tropical fruit to be grown in the 1600s France.&lt;ref name="Lance. 1996"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citrus : complete guide to selecting &amp; growing more than 100 varieties for California, Arizona, Texas, the Gulf Coast and Florida|last=Lance.|first=Walheim|date=1996|publisher=Ironwood Press|isbn=978-0-9628236-4-0|location=Tucson, Ariz.|oclc=34116821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
The generic name originated from [[Latin]], where it referred to either the plant now known as [[citron]] (''C. medica'') or a conifer tree (''[[Thuja]]''). It is somehow related to the [[ancient Greek]] word for [[Lebanon Cedar|cedar]], κέδρος (''kédros''). This may be due to perceived similarities in the smell of citrus leaves and fruit with that of cedar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SmRJnd73dbYC |first=Pinchas |last=Spiegel-Roy |author2=Eliezer E. Goldschmidt |title=Biology of Citrus |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-33321-4 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Collectively, ''Citrus'' fruits and plants are also known by the [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[loanword]] '''agrumes''' (literally "sour fruits").

=== Evolution ===
The large citrus fruit of today evolved originally from small, edible berries over millions of years. Citrus plants diverged from a common ancestor about 15 million years ago, which was about when it diverged from the closely related [[severinia (plant)|severinia]], for example the [[Chinese box orange]]. About 7 million years ago, citrus plants diverged into two groups, the main citrus genus and the ancestors of the [[Trifoliate orange]] (poncirus), which is closely enough related that it can still be hybridized with all other citrus. These estimates are made using genetic mapping of plant [[chloroplast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/05/molbev.msv082.full.pdf+html A phylogenetic analysis of 34 chloroplast genomes elucidates the relationships between wild and domestic species within the genus Citrus]&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2018 concludes that citrus trees originated in the foothills of the [[Himalaya]]s, in the area of [[Assam]] ([[India]]), western [[Yunnan]] ([[China]]), and northern [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Helen (8 Feb 2018), "DNA Story of when life first gave us lemons," BBC, https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42960445, accessed 12 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The three original species in the citrus genus that have been hybridized into most modern commercial citrus fruit are the [[mandarin orange]], [[pomelo]], and [[citron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2954|title=A genealogy of the citrus family|first1=Riccardo|last1=Velasco|first2=Concetta|last2=Licciardello|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=32|issue=7|pages=640–642|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/nbt.2954|pmid=25004231|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the last few thousand years, all common citrus fruits (sweet oranges, lemons, grapefruit, limes, and so on) were created by crossing those original species.

The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[systematics]] of the genus are complex and the precise number of natural [[species]] is unclear, as many of the named species are [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] clonally propagated through seeds (by [[apomixis]]), and there is [[genetics|genetic]] evidence that even some wild, true-breeding species are of hybrid origin.

Most cultivated ''Citrus'' seem to be [[hybrid (biology)|natural]] or [[Hybrid speciation|artificial hybrids]] of a small number of core ancestral species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citrusgenome.ucr.edu/|title=International Citrus Genomics Consortium|work=ucr.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including the [[citron]], [[pomelo]], [[mandarin orange|mandarine]], and [[Papeda (citrus)|papedas]] (see image).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|volume=2|pages=199–214|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-9276-9_10|series = Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the World|year = 2014|last1 = Klein|first1 = Joshua D.|title = Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the Middle-East|isbn=978-94-017-9275-2|chapter=Citron Cultivation, Production and Uses in the Mediterranean Region}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural and cultivated [[citrus hybrid]]s include commercially important [[fruit]] such as [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[grapefruit]], [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], and some [[tangerine]]s.

== Description ==
[[File:Citrus fruits.jpg|thumb|left|Slices of various citrus fruits]]

=== Tree ===
These plants are large [[shrub]]s or small to moderate-sized trees, reaching {{convert|5|–|15|m|abbr=on}} tall, with [[Spine (botany)|spiny]] shoots and alternately arranged [[evergreen]] [[leaf|leaves]] with an entire margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://crfg.org/wp-content/uploads/CITRUS-PRUNING-Presentation.pdf|title=CITRUS PRUNING|last=Del Hotal|first=Tom|date=|website=California Rare Fruit Growers|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flower]]s are solitary or in small [[corymb]]s, each flower {{convert|2|–|4|cm|abbr=on}} diameter, with five (rarely four) white petals and numerous stamens; they are often very strongly scented.

=== Fruit ===

The [[fruit]] is a ''[[hesperidium]]'', a specialised berry, globose to elongated, {{convert|4|–|30|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|–|20|cm|abbr=on}} diameter, with a leathery rind or "peel" called a [[pericarp]]. The outermost layer of the pericarp is an "exocarp" called the [[flavedo]], commonly referred to as the [[Zest (ingredient)|zest]]. The middle layer of the pericarp is the mesocarp, which in citrus fruits consists of the white, spongy "albedo", or "pith".  The innermost layer of the pericarp is the endocarp. The space inside each segment is a [[locule]] filled with [[juice vesicles]], or "pulp". From the endocarp, string-like "hairs" extend into the locules, which provide nourishment to the fruit as it develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Citrus/b1241tx.html|title=Citrus fruit diagram|work=ucla.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003070722/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Citrus/b1241tx.html|archivedate=2012-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lith|title=Lith|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citrus fruits are notable for their fragrance, partly due to [[flavonoid]]s and [[limonoid]]s (which in turn are [[terpene]]s) contained in the rind, and most are juice-laden. The juice contains a high quantity of [[citric acid]] giving them their characteristic sharp flavour. The genus is commercially important as many species are cultivated for their fruit, which is eaten fresh, pressed for [[juice]], or preserved in [[marmalade]]s and [[pickling|pickles]].

They are also good sources of [[vitamin C]] and flavonoids. The content of vitamin C in the fruit depends on the species, variety and mode of cultivation. Fruits produced with organic agriculture have been shown to contain more vitamin C than those produced with conventional agriculture in the [[Algarve]], but results depended on the species and [[cultivar]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duarte|first1=A|last2=Caixeirinho|first2=D|last3=Miguel|first3=G|last4=Nunes|first4=C|last5=Mendes|first5=M|last6=Marreiros|first6=A|title=Vitamin C Content of Citrus from Conventional versus Organic Farming Systems|journal=Acta Horticulturae|date=2010|volume=868|issue=868|pages=389–394|doi=10.17660/ActaHortic.2010.868.52|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216361377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The flavonoids include various [[flavanone]]s and [[flavone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bbb/70/1/70_178/_article |title=Flavonoid Composition of Fruit Tissues of Citrus Species |journal= |access-date=2011-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528015124/http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bbb/70/1/70_178/_article |archive-date=2007-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==
{{further information|Citrus production}}
[[File:Lemon on a Wood Table.jpg|thumb|Lemons are a citrus fruit native to Asia, but now common worldwide.]]

[[File:Limes.jpg|thumb|[[Lime (fruit)|Limes]] in a grocery store]]
Citrus trees [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridise]] very readily – depending on the [[pollen]] source, plants grown from a [[Persian lime]]'s seeds can produce fruit similar to grapefruit. Thus all commercial citrus cultivation uses trees produced by [[grafting]] the desired fruiting [[cultivar]]s onto [[citrus rootstock|rootstocks]] selected for disease resistance and hardiness.

The colour of citrus fruits only develops in climates with a ([[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]]) cool winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Citrus|url = http://www.foodbyfranz.com/citrus/|accessdate = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tropical regions with no winter at all, citrus fruits remain green until maturity, hence the tropical "green oranges".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plantscientist.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/why-is-my-orange-green/|title=Why is my orange green?|last=SHAILES|first=SARAH|date=December 2014|website=Plant Scientist|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian lime in particular is extremely sensitive to cool conditions, thus it is not usually exposed to cool enough conditions to develop a mature colour.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} If they are left in a cool place over winter, the fruits will change colour to yellow.

The terms "ripe" and "mature" are usually used synonymously, but they mean different things. A mature fruit is one that has completed its growth phase. [[Ripening]] is the changes that occur within the fruit after it is mature to the beginning of decay. These changes usually involve starches converting to sugars, a decrease in acids and a softening and change in the fruit's colour.&lt;ref name="ÖpikRolfe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helgi Öpik|author2=Stephen A. Rolfe|author3=Arthur John Willis|author4=Herbert Edward Street|title=The physiology of flowering plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=atZq3w6pOvQC&amp;pg=PA309|accessdate=31 July 2010|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66251-2|pages=309–}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Citrus fruits are non-[[climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] and respiration slowly declines and the production and release of ethylene is gradual.&lt;ref name="Spiegel-RoyGoldschmidt1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pinchas Spiegel-Roy|author2=Eliezer E. Goldschmidt|title=Biology of citrus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmRJnd73dbYC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=31 July 2010|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-33321-4|pages=101–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruits do not go through a ripening process in the sense that they become "tree ripe." Some fruits, for example cherries, physically mature and then continue to ripen on the tree. Other fruits, like pears, are picked when mature but before they ripen, then continue to ripen off the tree. Citrus fruits pass from immaturity to maturity to over-maturity while still on the tree. Once they are separated from the tree, they will not increase in sweetness or continue to ripen. The only way change may happen after being picked is that they will eventually start to decay.

With oranges, colour cannot be used as an indicator of ripeness because sometimes the rinds turn orange long before the oranges are ready to eat. Tasting them is the only way to know whether or not they are ready to eat.

[[File:Mandariner Citrus deliciosa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mediterranean Mandarin]] (''[[Citrus ×deliciosa]]'' plantation, [[Son Carrió]] ([[Mallorca]])]]
Citrus trees are not generally [[frost]] hardy. [[Mandarin orange]]s (''C. reticulata'') tend to be the hardiest of the common ''Citrus'' species and can withstand short periods down to as cold as {{convert|−10|C}}, but realistically temperatures not falling below {{convert|−2|C}} are required for successful cultivation. [[Tangerine]]s, tangors and [[yuzu]] can be grown outside even in regions with more marked sub-freezing temperatures in winter, although this may affect fruit quality. A few hardy hybrids can withstand temperatures well below freezing, but do not produce quality fruit. Lemons can be commercially grown in cooler-summer/moderate-winter, coastal Southern California, because sweetness is neither attained nor expected in retail lemon fruit. The related [[trifoliate orange]] (''Citrus trifoliata'') can survive below {{convert|−20|C}}; its fruit are astringent and inedible unless cooked but a few better-tasting cultivars and hybrids have been developed (see [[citrange]]s).
[[File:Citrus leaf.JPG|thumb|Leaf of Citrus tree]]
The trees thrive in a consistently sunny, humid environment with fertile soil and adequate rainfall or irrigation. Abandoned trees in valleys may suffer, yet survive, the dry summer of Central California's [[Inner Coast Ranges]]. At any age citrus grows well enough with infrequent irrigation in partial shade, but the fruit crop is smaller. Being of tropical and sub-tropical origin, oranges, like all citrus, are broadleaved and evergreen. They do not drop leaves except when stressed.  The [[Plant stem|stems]] of many varieties have large sharp [[Spine (botany)|thorns]]. The trees flower in the spring, and fruit is set shortly afterward. Fruit begins to ripen in fall or early winter months, depending on cultivar, and develops increasing sweetness afterward. Some cultivars of tangerines ripen by winter. Some, such as the grapefruit, may take up to eighteen months to ripen.

=== Production ===
[[File:Hauptanbaugebiete-Zitrusfrüchte.svg|thumb|Major producer regions]]
{{See also|Citrus production}}
According to UN 2007 data, [[Brazil]], [[China]], the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[India]], and [[Spain]] are the world's largest citrus-producing countries.

Major commercial citrus growing areas include southern China, the [[Mediterranean Basin]] (including southern Spain), [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], the southern United States, Mexico and parts of [[South America]]. In the United States, [[Florida]], [[California]], [[Arizona]], and [[Texas]] are major producers, while smaller plantings are present in other [[Sun Belt]] states and in [[Hawaii]].

=== As ornamental plants ===
[[File:Orangerie Kruidtuin Leuven.jpg|thumb|[[Orangery]] of the [[Botanical Garden]] in [[Leuven]] ([[Belgium]])]]
Citrus trees grown in tubs and wintered under cover were a feature of [[History of gardens|Renaissance gardens]], once glass-making technology enabled sufficient expanses of clear glass to be produced. An [[orangery]] was a feature of royal and aristocratic residences through the 17th and 18th centuries. The ''Orangerie'' at the [[Louvre|Palace of the Louvre]], 1617, inspired imitations that were not eclipsed until the development of the modern greenhouse in the 1840s. In the United States the earliest surviving orangery is at the [[Mount Airy, Richmond County, Virginia|Tayloe House, Mount Airy, Virginia]]. George Washington had an orangery at [[Mount Vernon]].

Some modern hobbyists still grow dwarf citrus in containers or greenhouses in areas where it is too cold to grow it outdoors. Consistent climate, sufficient sunlight, and proper watering are crucial if the trees are to thrive and produce fruit. Compared to many of the usual "green shrubs", citrus trees better tolerate poor container care. For cooler winter areas, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]] and [[lemon]]s should not be grown, since they are more sensitive to winter cold than other citrus fruits. Hybrids with [[kumquat]]s (× ''[[Citrofortunella]]'') have good cold resistance. A citrus tree in a container may have to be re-potted every 5 years or so since the roots may form a thick "root-ball" on the bottom of the pot.&lt;ref name="Lance. 1996" /&gt;

=== Pests and diseases ===
{{Main|List of citrus diseases}}
[[File:Citrus canker on fruit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Citrus canker]] is caused by the [[gammaproteobacterium]] ''Xanthomonas axonopodis'']]
Citrus plants are very liable to infestation by [[aphid]]s, [[whitefly]] and [[scale insect]]s (e.g. [[California red scale]]). Also rather important are the viral infections to which some of these [[ectoparasite]]s serve as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] such as the aphid-transmitted ''[[Citrus tristeza virus]]'' which when unchecked by proper methods of control is devastating to citrine plantations. The newest threat to citrus groves in the United States is the [[Diaphorina citri|Asian citrus psyllid]].

The Asian citrus psyllid is an aphid-like insect that feeds on the leaves and stems of citrus trees and other citrus-like plants. The real danger lies that the psyllid can carry a deadly, bacterial tree disease called [http://www.californiacitrusthreat.org/huanglongbing-citrus-greening.php Huanglongbing (HLB)], also known as citrus greening disease.&lt;ref name="californiacitrusthreat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiacitrusthreat.org/asian-citrus-psyllid.php|title=About the Asian Citrus Psyllid and Huanglongbing|work=californiacitrusthreat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005 citrus greening disease was discovered in the south Florida region around Homestead and Florida City.  The disease has since spread to every commercial citrus grove in Florida.  In 2004–2005 USDA Ag statistics reported the total Florida citrus production to be 169.1 million boxes of fruit. The estimate for all Florida citrus production in the 2015–2016 season is 94.2 million boxes—a 44.3% drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Florida/Publications/Citrus/Citrus_Statistics/2015-16/fcs1516.pdf|title=Florida Citrus Statistics 2015–2016|last=|first=|date=3 October 2017|website=United States Department of Agriculture – National Agricultural Statistics Service|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the psyllid was spotted dangerously close to California – right across the international border in [[Tijuana]], Mexico. Only a few months later, it was detected in San Diego and Imperial counties, and has since spread to Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura counties sparking quarantines in those areas. The Asian citrus psyllid has also been intercepted coming into California in packages of fruit and plants, including citrus, ornamentals, herbs and bouquets of cut flowers, shipped from other states and countries.&lt;ref name="californiacitrusthreat" /&gt;

The foliage is also used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species such as the [[Geometridae]] [[common emerald]] (''Hemithea aestivaria'') and [[double-striped pug]] (''Gymnoscelis rufifasciata''), the [[Arctiidae]] [[giant leopard moth]] (''Hypercompe scribonia''), ''[[Hypercompe eridanus|H. eridanus]]'', ''[[Hypercompe icasia|H. icasia]]'' and ''[[Hypercompe indecisa|H. indecisa]]'', many species in the family Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies), and the [[black-lyre leafroller moth]] (''"Cnephasia" jactatana''), a [[tortrix moth]].

Since 2000, the [[citrus leafminer]] (''Phyllocnistis citrella'') has been a pest in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r107303211.html |title=Citrus Leafminer – UC Pest Management }}&lt;/ref&gt; boring meandering patterns through leaves.

In eastern Australia, the [[bronze-orange bug]] (''[[Musgraveia sulciventris]]'') can be a major pest of citrus trees, particularly grapefruit. In heavy infestations it can cause flower and fruit drop and general tree stress.

European brown snails (''[[Cornu aspersum]]'') can be a problem in California, though laying female [[Khaki Campbell]] and other [[mallard]]-related [[duck]]s can be used for control.

==== Deficiency diseases ====
Citrus plants can also develop a deficiency condition called [[chlorosis]], characterized by yellowing leaves&lt;ref name="SumoGardener"&gt;Online at SumoGardener {{cite web |url=http://sumogardener.com/yellow-leaves-citrus-trees/ |title=How to Avoid Yellow Leaves on Citrus Trees |date=2016-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted by contrasting [[leaf vein]]s. The shriveling leaves eventually fall, and if the plant loses too many, it will slowly die. This condition is often caused by an excessively high [[pH]] ([[alkaline soil]]), which prevents the plant from absorbing [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[zinc]], or other nutrients it needs to produce [[chlorophyll]]. This condition can be cured by adding an appropriate acidic fertilizer formulated for citrus, which can sometimes revive a plant to produce new leaves and even flower buds within a few weeks under optimum conditions. A soil which is too acidic can also cause problems; citrus prefers neutral soil (pH between 6 and 8). Citrus plants are also sensitive to excessive [[salt]] in the soil. [[Soil testing]] may be necessary to properly diagnose nutrient deficiency diseases.&lt;ref name=Mauk&gt;{{cite web|last=Mauk|first=Peggy A.|title=Questions and Answers to Citrus Management (3rd ed.)|url=http://ucanr.edu/datastoreFiles/391-272.pdf|publisher=University of California Cooperative Extension|accessdate=2014-05-24|author2=Tom Shea }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Culinary ===
[[File:NIH citrus.jpg|thumb|upright|Wedges of pink [[grapefruit]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], and [[lemon]], and a half [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] (clockwise from top)]]

Many citrus fruits, such as [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[tangerine]]s, [[grapefruit]]s, and [[clementine]]s, are generally eaten fresh. They are typically peeled and can be easily split into segments. Grapefruit is more commonly halved and eaten out of the skin with a spoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aihd.ku.edu/foods/grapefruit.html |title=American Indian Health – Health |publisher=Aihd.ku.edu |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are special spoons ([[grapefruit spoon]]s) with serrated tips designed for this purpose. Orange and grapefruit juices are also very popular [[breakfast]] beverages. More acidic citrus, such as [[lemon]]s and [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], are generally not eaten on their own. [[Meyer lemon]]s can be eaten out of hand with the fragrant skin; they are both sweet and sour. [[Lemonade]] or [[limeade]] are popular beverages prepared by diluting the juices of these fruits and adding sugar. Lemons and limes are also used as garnishes or in cooked dishes. Their juice is used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes; it can commonly be found in salad dressings and squeezed over cooked meat or vegetables.

A variety of flavours can be derived from different parts and treatments of citrus fruits. The [[peel (fruit)|rind]] and [[essential oil|oil]] of the fruit is generally very bitter, especially when cooked, and so is often combined with sugar. The [[juice vesicles|fruit pulp]] can vary from sweet to extremely sour. [[Marmalade]], a condiment derived from cooked orange and lemon, can be especially bitter, but is usually sweetened to cut the bitterness and produce a jam-like result. Lemon or lime is commonly used as a [[garnish (food)|garnish]] for water, soft drinks, or cocktails. Citrus juices, rinds, or slices are used in a variety of mixed drinks. The colourful outer skin of some citrus fruits, known as [[zest (ingredient)|zest]], is used as a flavouring in cooking; the white inner portion of the peel, the pith, is usually avoided due to its bitterness. The zest of a citrus fruit, typically lemon or an orange, can also be soaked in water in a [[coffee filter]], and drunk.

=== Medical ===
Citrus fruits have well-documented nutritional and health benefits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They can actually help prevent and cure some diseases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Citrus fruit intake has been associated with a 10% reduction in odds of developing breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Jung-Kook|last2=Bae|first2=Jong-Myon|date=2013-03-01|title=Citrus fruit intake and breast cancer risk: a quantitative systematic review|journal=Journal of Breast Cancer|volume=16|issue=1|pages=72–76|doi=10.4048/jbc.2013.16.1.72|issn=1738-6756|pmc=3625773|pmid=23593085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oranges were historically used for their high content of [[vitamin C]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which prevents [[scurvy]]. Scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency, and can be prevented by having 10 milligrams of vitamin C a day. An early sign of scurvy is fatigue. If ignored, later symptoms are bleeding and bruising easily. British sailors were given a ration of citrus fruits on long voyages to prevent the onset of scurvy, hence the British nickname of [[Limey]].

[[Pectin]] is a structural [[heteropolysaccharide]] contained in the primary cell walls of plants. Limes and lemons as well as oranges and grapefruits are among the highest in this level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Laura | last=Morgan | date=15 March 2011 |title=What Fruits &amp; Vegetables Contain Pectin? | publisher=Demand Media | url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/403204-what-fruits-vegetables-contain-pectin/ | accessdate=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After consumption, the peel is sometimes used as a facial cleanser.

Before the development of [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]]-based processes, lemons were the primary commercial source of [[citric acid]].

Citrus fruit intake is [[association (statistics)|associated]] with a reduced risk of [[stomach cancer]].&lt;ref name="pmid24011243"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=González CA, Sala N, Rokkas T | title=Gastric cancer: epidemiologic aspects| journal=Helicobacter| year=2013 | volume=18 | issue=Supplement 1 | pages=34–38 | pmid=24011243 | doi=10.1111/hel.12082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, citrus fruit juices, such as orange, lime and lemon, may be useful for lowering the risk of specific types of [[kidney stone]]s. Grapefruit is another fruit juice that can be used to lower blood pressure because it interferes with the metabolism of calcium channel blockers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2005 | title = Grapefruit and Medication | url = | journal = Total Health  | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lemons have the highest concentration of citrate of any citrus fruit, and daily consumption of [[lemonade]] has been shown to decrease the rate of kidney stone formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jackie | last=Carr | date=22 April 2010 | title=Five Ways to Prevent Kidney Stones | publisher=UC San Diego | url=http://health.ucsd.edu/news/2010/4-22-kidney-stones.htm | accessdate=2010-12-03 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120091049/http://health.ucsd.edu/news/2010/4-22-kidney-stones.htm | archivedate=20 November 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sweet and sour ==
The Moroccan professor Henri Chapot discovered that the acidity in the more common citrons or [[lemon]]s is represented by red on the inner coat of seeds specifically on the [[chalaza]]l spot, violet pigmentation on the outer side of the flower blossom, and also by the new buds that are reddish-purplish. The acidless varieties of citrus are completely lacking the red color in all the mentioned spots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jatba_0370-5412_1950_num_30_335_6729 ''Un curieux cedrat Marocain'' (1950) Rev. Intl. Bot. Appl. Agr. Trop. 30:506–514].&lt;/ref&gt; This designation was cited by [[Herbert John Webber]] and [[Leon Dexter Batchelor]], the editors of the fundamental treatise on citrus, namely [[The Citrus Industry (book)|The Citrus Industry]], which was published by the [[University of California, Riverside]] in 1967.

== Fossil record ==
A [[fossil]] leaf from the [[Pliocene]] of [[Valdarno]] ([[Italy]]) is described as †'''''Citrus meletensis'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Citrus meletensis (Rutaceae), a new species from the Pliocene of Valdarno (Italy)

In [[China]] fossil leaf specimens of  †'''''Citrus linczangensis''''' have been collected from coal-bearing strata of the Bangmai Formation in the Bangmai village, about 10&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Lincang City]], [[Yunnan]]. The Bangmai Formation contains abundant fossil plants and is considered to be of late [[Miocene]] age, ''Citrus linczangensis'' and ''C. meletensis'' share some important characters, such as an intramarginal vein, an entire margin, and an articulated and distinctly winged [[botany|petiole]].&lt;ref&gt;Citrus linczangensis sp. n., a Leaf Fossil of Rutaceae from the Late Miocene of Yunnan, China by Sanping Xie, Steven R Manchester, Kenan Liu and Bainian Sun – International Journal of Plant Sciences 174(8):1201–1207 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cloudburst''' is an extreme amount of [[precipitation]] in a short period of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/glossary/glu/EN/GF0200EN.HTM|title=International Glossary of Hydrology|last=|first=|publisher=World Meteorological Organization and UNESCO|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103204941/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/glossary/glu/EN/GF0200EN.HTM|archivedate=2005-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes accompanied by [[hail]]  and thunder, which is capable of creating flood conditions. A cloudburst can suddenly dump large amounts of water e.g. 25&amp;nbsp;mm of precipitation corresponds to 25,000 metric tons/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1 inch corresponds to 72,300&amp;nbsp;short tons over one square mile). However, cloudbursts are infrequent as they occur only via [[orographic lift]] or occasionally when a warm air parcel mixes with cooler air, resulting in sudden [[condensation]]. At times, a large amount of runoff from higher elevations is mistakenly conflated with a cloudburst. The term "cloudburst" arose from the notion that clouds were akin to water balloons and could burst, resulting in rapid precipitation. Though this idea has since been disproven, the term remains in use.
                                                                                                           
==Properties==

Rainfall rate equal to or greater than {{convert|100|mm|in}} per hour is a cloudburst.&lt;ref name="The Saakal Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sakaaltimes.com/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=5149259322361054146&amp;SectionId=5171561142064258099&amp;SectionName=Pune&amp;NewsDate=20101104&amp;NewsTitle=IT%20WAS%20A%20CLOUDBURST,%20SAYS%20WEATHER%20SCIENTIST|title= It was a cloudburst, says weather scientest|publisher=news.saakaltimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=What is a cloudburst? |newspaper=Rediff News, India |date=August 1, 2005 |url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/aug/01gi1.htm |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different definitions are used, e.g. the Swedish weather service SMHI defines the corresponding Swedish term "skyfall" as 1&amp;nbsp;mm/min for short bursts and 50&amp;nbsp;mm/h for longer rainfalls. The associated convective [[cloud]] can extend up to a height of {{convert|15|km|mi}} above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Cloud Burst over Leh (Jammu &amp; Kashmir)|url= http://www.imd.gov.in/doc/cloud-burst-over-leh.pdf|postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

During a cloudburst, more than {{convert|20|mm|in}} of rain may fall in a few minutes. The results of cloudbursts can be disastrous. Cloudbursts are also responsible for [[flash flood]] creation.

Rapid precipitation from [[cumulonimbus]] clouds is possible due to the [[Langmuir circulation|Langmuir precipitation process]] in which large droplets can grow rapidly by coagulating with smaller droplets which fall down slowly. It is not essential that cloudbursts occur only when a cloud clashes with a solid body like a mountain. They can also occur when hot water vapor mingles into the cold resulting in sudden condensation.

'''Cowans Gap State Park''' is a {{convert|1085|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Todd Township, Fulton County, Pennsylvania|Todd Township]], [[Fulton County, Pennsylvania|Fulton County]] and [[Metal Township, Pennsylvania|Metal Township]], [[Franklin County, Pennsylvania|Franklin County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States. The park is largely surrounded by [[Buchanan State Forest]] in Allens Valley just off [[Pennsylvania Route 75]] near [[Fort Loudon, Pennsylvania|Fort Loudon]].

==History==
===French and Indian War===
The history of Cowans Gap State Park stretches back to the [[French and Indian War]]. At the time the Cowans Gap was on the western frontier of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. The land to the west was held by the [[New France|French]] and their [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] allies the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] and [[Wyandot people|Huron]]. The French and British fought for control of the [[Ohio River Valley]], including the area surrounding [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. British Major General [[Edward Braddock]] led an expedition through southwestern Pennsylvania in 1755.  His men built [[Braddock's Road]] from [[Cumberland, Maryland]] to present-day North Braddock. At the same time, Braddock's subordinate, Colonel [[James Burd]] was building [[Burd's Road]] from [[Shippensburg, Pennsylvania|Shippensburg]] to connect with Braddock's Road. Burd's road, built as a supply line, passed through Cowans Gap but was never completed due to Braddock's defeat at the Monongahela. The road ended just past [[Berlin, Pennsylvania|Berlin]].&lt;ref name="cgsp"/&gt;
The British again tried to gain control of the Ohio River Valley in 1758, this time under the leadership of General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|John Forbes]], whose second-in-command was Lieutenant Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] (Forbes' aide was Colonel [[George Washington]]). They picked up where Burd's Road left off, built the [[Forbes Road]] and ultimately drove the French and their Indian allies out of Western Pennsylvania. Colonel Bouquet used the Forbes Road one more time in 1763 to break the [[siege]] of [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="cgsp"/&gt;

===The Cowan Homestead===
Cowans Gap is named for John and Mary Cowan, who settled there just after the [[American Revolution]]. The Cowans met in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in 1775. John Samuel Cowan was from a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] family and Mary Mueller was from a [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] family. Cowan reached the rank of [[Major]] in the British Army during the war, and returned to Boston at the conclusion of the war to ask for Mary's hand in [[marriage]]. The Mueller family forbade the marriage and John and Mary [[elope]]d. At first they settled in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]], where they lived  for a few years before heading out for [[Kentucky]]. Their wagon was disabled while crossing [[Conococheague Creek]] near [[Fort Loudoun (Pennsylvania)|Fort Loudoun]], so John Cowan traded his [[horse]]s and broken wagon to a [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] [[tribal chief|chief]] for the land that is now known at Cowans Gap. Cowan received a [[smoking pipe]] and [[Cabin rights|tomahawk rights]], which entailed marking a large [[chestnut]] tree on his property with three slashes, as a sign of peace with the Tuscarora. John Cowan secured a deed for the land from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1785. The Cowans built their home along Forbes Road near the present day intersection of Aughwick Road and Stumpy Lane.&lt;ref name="cgsp"/&gt;

===Deforestation===
The [[old-growth forest]]s in and surrounding Cowans Gap State Park were clear cut during the late 18th and early 19th centuries to meet the need for [[charcoal]] at nearby Mount Pleasant [[bloomery|iron furnace]]. [[Charcoal maker|Colliers]] harvested the stands of [[Eastern white pine|white pine]], [[tsuga|hemlock]], and [[hardwood]]s, and made charcoal by stacking timber around large hearths. The hearths were fired by the collier, who tended them for 10 to 14 days until the charcoal was ready. The forests regrew until 1865 when another iron furnace, Richmond Furnace, was built. Once again the timber was harvested and turned into charcoal. The Richmond Furnace was in operation until 1885. The trees that were not cut down for charcoal were ultimately felled by a [[lumber]]ing operation owned by Harrison Kalbach of [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]]. He bought {{convert|4800|acre}} of woodland that was stripped of all its trees by 1907. The land was left largely barren, covered mostly with dried out tree tops that were burnt to ashes in massive wild fires that were set off by sparks from passing [[steam locomotive]]s. An immense reforestation effort, led by the young men of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], began in earnest during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="cgsp"/&gt;

===Civilian Conservation Corps===
The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] created by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the Great Depression, provided work for the unemployed from throughout the United States. A CCC camp, Richmond Furnace Camp PA-SP-54, was built at the site of Cowans Gap State Park. At first the young men lived in [[tent]]s, but they soon built [[log cabin|cabin]]s (which are still in use at the park). The young men of the CCC also planted thousands of acres of new trees, built four bridges, {{convert|30|mi}} of state roads, {{convert|32|mi}} of fire trails, and {{convert|11|mi}} of telephone lines. In addition, the CCC also cleared the forests and streams of brush, built [[pavilion]]s, and constructed the [[dam]] that created [[Cowans Gap Lake]]. The park opened to the public in 1937.&lt;ref name="cgsp"/&gt;
[[File:cowansgaplake.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of the lake from the dam.]]

==Recreation==
Cowans Gap State Park is open for year-round [[recreation]]. It has extensive [[picnic]] facilities that surround much of Cowans Gap Lake.  The park is also open to hiking, cross country skiing, hunting, fishing, [[ice fishing]], [[ice skating]], and boating.&lt;ref name="cgsp"&gt;{{cite web

* '''Cameron Trail''' ({{convert|0.5|mi|m}}) is a "difficult" trail on the southern boundary of the park that ends atop [[Cove Mountain (conservation area)|Cove Mountain]].&lt;ref name="cgsptrails"/&gt;
* '''Geyer Trail''' ({{convert|0.5|mi|m}}) is a "difficult" trail. It begins at Aughwick Road near the [[dam]] on Cowans Gap Lake and ascends [[Tuscarora Mountain]], passing through patches of [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] before it connects with [[Tuscarora Trail]].&lt;ref name="cgsptrails"/&gt;
* '''Logging Road Trail''' ({{convert|1.7|mi}}) is an "easy" trail. This trail passes around the base of Cove Mountain and connects with many of the other trails in the park.

* '''Horseshoe Trail''' ({{convert|0.6|mi|m}}) is a "very difficult" trail. This trail is very steep and is for experienced hikers only. Horseshoe Trail passes over loose stone on steep slopes as it ascends Cove Mountain and ends at Knobsville Road Trail.&lt;ref name="cgsptrails"/&gt;
* '''Knobsville Road Trail''' ({{convert|1.3|mi}}) is a "moderate" trail. It follows an old road constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and also ascends Cove Mountain. It passes by a [[landslide]] exhibit, an old [[incinerator]] that was built and used by the CCC, and provides access to the park overlook. The trail intersects with Horseshoe Trail before it ends in Buchanan State Forest.&lt;ref name="cgsptrails"/&gt;
* '''One Mile Trail''' is not one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km), but rather only a {{convert|0.4|mi|m|adj=on}} "easy" trail. One Mile Trail gets its name because it is one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from Parking Lot #3 on Aughwick Road.&lt;ref name="cgsptrails"/&gt;

* '''Three Mile Trail''' is {{convert|1.1|mi}} long, not three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km); it is a  "moderate" trail. It is three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) down Aughwick Road from Parking Lot #3. Three Mile Trail passes through patches of mountain laurel along the side of Tuscarora Mountain.&lt;ref name="cgsptrails"/&gt;
* '''[[Tuscarora Trail]]''' is a spur trail to the [[Appalachian Trail]]. It passes through Cowans Gap State Park for {{convert|2|mi}}.&lt;ref name="cgsptrails"/&gt; 
* '''[[Forbes Trail]]''' is a [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] trail that passes through much of southern Pennsylvania. The trailheads are near Carlisle in the east and Pittsburgh in the west.

[[Image:CGSP Snowy Lake.jpg|thumb|Cowans Gap Lake in the winter]]
Cowans Gap Lake ({{convert|42|acre}}) was created by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression by damming [[Little Aughwick Creek]]. The lake is open for recreational [[fishing]], [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[boating]], as well as ice skating and ice fishing at Cowans Gap State Park. Visitors are asked to use caution in winter as the thickness of the ice is not monitored by the park staff (except in the ice skating area located near the beach).&lt;ref name="cgsp"/&gt;

Fishermen visit the lake in pursuit of [[trout]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], [[panfish]] and [[perch]]. Little Aughwick Creek is a trout fishery. All anglers are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]].&lt;ref name="cgsp"/&gt;

Beginning in 2008 lifeguards will not be posted at the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesleader.com/news/ap?articleID=384046 |title=Pa. state parks going without life guards at beaches in 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=[[Times Leader]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007235840/http://www.timesleader.com/news/ap?articleID=384046 |archivedate=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The beach is open from 11:00 am until 7:00 pm. A food concession at the beach sells [[pizza]], [[funnel cake]], [[french fries]], soft serve [[ice cream]], [[soft drinks]] and many other snacks.&lt;ref name="cgsp"/&gt;

Gas powered boats are prohibited on Cowans Gap Lake. Electric powered and non-powered boats must have a current registration with any state. A concession at the lake is open during the summer months for the renting of [[row boats|row]] and paddle boats.&lt;ref name="cgsp"/&gt;

'''Deloy Ges''' is the [[Deg Xinag language]] name for the village of [[Anvik, Alaska]], home to the [[Deg Hit'an]] people. More specifically, it refers to Anvik Hill, also called Hawk Bluff, the current site of the [[Anvik Airport]].

Deloy Ges Inc. is also the name for the Deg Hit'an Native corporation. It translates literally as 'so-called mountain' or 'bum mountain'.

The traditional story, retold by elder [[Alta Jerue]], says that one day, [[Yixgitsiy]] (also simply known as [[Raven Tales|Raven]]) was walking along the [[Yukon River]], when he saw a soil pile and decided to make a mountain. They say, every time he tried to climb it, the soil would slide down, bringing him along. After a short while, frustrated Yixgitsiy angrily hit at the pile with his walking stick, sending it all over. This is the reason, given in lore, for the many [[gulch]]es on Anvik Hill, the so-called mountain.

The Deg Xinag word for 'raven' translates as 'your (plural) grandfather', as he is revered as the mythological village chief.

In [[Philippine mythology]], a '''diwata''' (derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[devata]]'' देवता; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.filipiknow.net/the-ancient-visayan-deities-of-philippine-mythology/&lt;/ref&gt; '''encantada''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is a type of deity or spirit. The term "diwata" has taken on levels of meaning since its assimilation into the mythology of the pre-colonial Filipinos. The term is traditionally used in the Visayas, Palawan, and Mindanao regions, while the term ''anito'' is used in Luzon regions. Both terms are used in Bicol, Marinduque, Romblon, and Mindoro, signifying a 'buffer zone' area for the two terms.

When the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish conquered the Philippines]] the commonly used meaning of the term reduced from goddess to [[dryad]]-like spirit which was considered benevolent or neutral. These spirits were invoked ritually for positive crop growth, health, and fortune; however, they were also considered to be able to incur illness or misfortune if not given proper respect.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Scott's ''Barangay: Sixteenth-Century Philippine Culture and Society'', 1994 {{ISBN|9789715501354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were said to reside in large trees, such as [[acacia]] and [[Banyan|balete]] and were understood as the guardian spirits of nature: casting blessings or curses upon those who brought benefits or harm to the forests and [[mountain]]s.

In modern times, the term "diwata" is sometimes loosely used to refer to a generic type of beings, much like "elf" or "fairy," or very specific types. The term "diwata" is synonymous to "anito" and the usage of the word "diwata" is more prevalent in the southern Philippines, while "anito" takes its place in the northern areas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Characteristics ==
Although there are numerous and varied accounts as to what they should look like, a general trend may be observed in that they are normally human in appearance—beautiful and seemingly ageless at that—save for some distinct characteristics. This may take the form of not having a [[philtrum]] or having continuously smooth and supple skin that somehow resemble fingernails, without any wrinkled parts as in the elbows and knees. They tend to be fairer than average, as pale skin has been associated with the supernatural even during pre-colonial times (for example, the "white lady" belief is prevalent in the East and Southeast Asian regions).

Visayan epics such as [[Hinilawod]] described them as very beautiful, some having golden skin, other having luminous fair skin.

===Etymology===
{{Main|Devata}}
[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 10.jpg|thumb|260px|A male devata, flanked by a two [[apsara]]s, [[Vishnu]] temple, [[Prambanan]].]]
The word Diwata has been used since during the pre-hispanic times, when [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] had been practice in the lowland areas on the archipelago. the term Diwata was derived form [[Sanskrit]] word [[Devata]] ([[Devanagari]]: देवता).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.filipiknow.net/the-ancient-visayan-deities-of-philippine-mythology/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/diwata/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] it was called ''Tevoda'' (ទេវតា); in the  [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Balinese language|Balinese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''dewata''; [[Batak languages]]: ''debata'' [[Toba Batak language|(Toba)]], ''dibata'' [[Batak Karo language|(Karo)]], ''naibata'' [[Batak Simalungun language|(Simalungun)]]) is a smaller, more focused deva. The term "devata" can also mean deva (pl: devatas, meaning the gods). There are [[God and gender in Hinduism|male and female]] ''devatas''. There are many kinds of devatas: vanadevatas (forest spirits, perhaps descendants of early nature-spirit cults), [[gramadevata|village gods]], devatas of river crossings, caves, mountains, and so on. In Hinduism, the devatas that guard the eight, nine and ten cardinal points are called [[Lokapala]] ([[Guardians of the directions|Guardians of the Directions]]) or, more specifically in ancient [[Java]] tradition, ''Dewata Nawa Sanga'' ([[Surya Majapahit|Guardians of Nine Directions]]). Every human activity has its devata, its spiritual counterpart or aspect.

==Concepts==
The inhabitants of precolonial Philippines worshiped diwatas and believed them to be deities created by the one true God to help administer his creation. The term "diwata" applies to both male and female deities (e.g., Diwata Barangaw, who is the male god of rainbows).

The diwata were worshiped and venerated in pre-colonial Philippines are depicted as superior in beauty, in knowledge, and in fighting skills. They are prayed to and given offerings to grant requests and to answer prayers.

In modern concept, due to the Spanish destruction of most of the pre-colonial Philippine culture, the rank and image of a diwata from goddess was turned into enchantress or nymph, being beautiful with preternatural allure that lives in the forest and trees.
&lt;!--
===Lambana===
The term ''lambana'', which means "he upon whom all depend" in Sanskrit, is an old Tagalog word for a drawing symbol or picture that represents a deities of the ancient pagan religion of the Tagalog people. It is a term used for small winged creatures ([[pixie]]s) that assist and serve as serfs and handmaidens to the diwata,
--&gt;
===Encanto===
A male diwata is coined as ''enkanto,'' thought they seem to be of a totally different race. They are believed to be malevolent with very pale skin to white skin that sparkles under direct sunlight, light colored hair, and fangs. It resides primarily near the sea or any body of water. It is customary for [[Filipino people|Filipino]] fishermen to offer meat and other delicacies to the ''enkanto'' by throwing them into the sea, after a day's bountiful catch.

Popular mythology states that ''diwata'' live inside tree trunks, in the form of spirits. In the Philippines, it is common to see trees with trunks larger than 5" or 6" in diameter left standing when trees have been cut. This is believed to prevent the spirit from being released, as it is not known if he is a "white" or "black" spirit. If he is a black spirit, it is believed he can cause serious misfortune to the one who stole his home.

Enkantos have many similarities to humans in that they age, appear to have male and female sexes, can suffer from illness, and die. They are an object mythology for many Filipinos as they are mostly pictured as non-muscular beautiful men having crystal blue eyes, fair complexion and golden hair. They may have unusual features such as high-bridged noses, fair skin, and no philtrum. They are also known to be taller than human beings. Some say they have leaf-shaped ears and that they sparkle under direct sunlight or grow sharp teeth when threatened.

Other variants exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]] such as Bagobo spirits which are separated into the female ''tahamaling'' and the male ''mahomanay''. The female spirit is alleged to have red complexion while the male has a fair complexion. Their dwellings will normally appear as natural features, for example large rocks or trees, although to humans they have befriended they can appear as magnificent palaces.

These creatures prefer large trees such as the balete in which they place their belongings.

==Term usage==
The term, ''diwata'', itself is extremely diverse in usage as noted by the research of [[Ferdinand Blumentritt]] and other notable scholars. According to their research, ''diwata''' refers to different entities depending on the ethnic people. The research collected different meanings of ''diwata'':&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-09-02-1971/hislop-anitism-survey-religious%20beliefs-native-philippines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

===Television===
In the television [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''Okay ka, Fairy Ko'' created by MZET productions, diwatas live in a mythical world named Enkantasya where Ina Magenta is the Queen of the diwatas. Ina Magenta's daughter, Faye, is married to Enteng Kabisote, a human.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Diwata have been featured on [[GMA Network]] fantasy series ''[[Encantadia]]'' and ''[[Mulawin]]'' whereby diwatas are a race of supernatural being living in Encantadia, a dimension beyond the human world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='I Juander': Naniniwala pa ba sa diwata si Juan? |publisher=GMA  News |date=July 15, 2013 |URL=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/317550/newstv/ijuander/i-juander-naniniwala-pa-ba-sa-diwata-si-juan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the depiction of a diwata on both series have European influences as pure diwatas were shown to have pointed ears like [[elf|elves]], one of them is [[Cassiopeia (Encantadia)|Cassiopeia]] and some resemble fairies, like [[Muyak]], human-like diwatas are born from a diwata and another encantado. All diwatas and encantados reside in the 'Kingdom of Lireo'. A diwata or an encantado that has royal blood is called ''Sang'gre'', which can be distinguished by their markings on their back, the ''nga'' character from the [[Baybayin]] script. The Queen of the diwata in Lireo carries the title of ''Ynang Reyna''. Lirean society is matriarchal and only a ''Sang'gre'' in the [[matriarch]] line may ascend the throne.

Another television series from GMA Network, ''[[Amaya (TV series)|Amaya]]'', depicts diwata as goddesses who may be called upon through a ritual. The diwatas here areoriginate from ancient Visayan foklore. The series revolves around the life of Amaya, a binukot (kept maiden) and her fate to become the most powerful woman of her time. It is set during the pre-colonial times of the Philippines.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The diwata shown were 
*Maguayen, who ferries the souls of the dead to Sulad (Purgatory).
*Pandaki, who can change a fate of a dungan (soul). She brings good dungan from Sulad to Saad (Heaven) to be an umalagad.
*Malandok, god of war.
*[[Bakunawa]] (a dragon), guardian of Sulad.

In another GMA Network TV series, ''[[Indio (TV series)|Indio]]'', diwata are gods or goddesses that can be called or prayed upon. ''Indio'' is about a man with a diwata mother and a human father. During the Spanish colonial period, he protects the Filipinos from the Spaniards.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Similar to ''Amaya'', these diwatas originate from ancient Visayan foklore. Some of them are:
*Makaptan, the supreme god
*Ynaguiginid, war and earth goddess (successor of Malandok)
*Magayon, goddess of flying animals, also a wood goddess
*Lalahon, goddess of fire and volcanoes
*Lidagat, water goddess
*Libulan, moon goddess
*Lihangin, wind goddess
*Dalikmata, goddess of eye diseases and visions, also an ice goddess.
*Adlaw, sun god
*Barangaw, rainbow god
*Ribung Linti, thunderstorm god

The term ''lambana'' is an old Tagalog word for a drawing symbol or picture that represents a deity of the ancient pagan religion of the Tagalog people was recently used in fantasy-themed television shows such as [[ABS-CBN]]'s ''[[Pedro Penduko]]'' as a term for "small fairies".{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It can be argued that the term was first used in ''[[Encantadia]]'' as a reference to [[Muyak]] and later on in ''[[Luna Mystika]]'' where it was used to identify the characters played by [[Pauleen Luna]] and [[Michelle Madrigal]].

===Music===
Diwata is a Filipino singer-comedian who made a mark with the Tagalog remake of the English song "Sincerely" and became well known with "Sisirin Mo," a naughty song with double meaning that titillated the masses' imagination from her self-titled album ''Diwata''. This album launched a whole new genre of songs that shocked the sensibilities of the predominantly Catholic Philippines in 2001.

In 2014, rapper [[Abra (rapper)|Abra]] released a song titled "[[Diwata (song)|Diwata]]", which features [[Parokya Ni Edgar]] vocalist [[Chito Miranda]], from his self-titled debut album.

There is a Filipino Rock Band named "Diwata" that consists of 5 individuals namely, Lem Andrade on vocals, Rai Peralta on lead guitar, Paul Medina on drums, Ryan Mascardo on rhythm guitar and Jaycee Alipio on bass. They started the band late 2008 and still rocking the stage of Manila and near provinces until today.

===Literature===
One of the characters in the play ''Speech and Debate'' by [[Stephen Karam]] is named "Diwata," and claims to have some Filipino ancestry.

===Comics===

In the [[comics]], the character created by [[Gener Pedrina]] for the Sanduguan Universe, Diwata is a half-human and half-encantada whose real name is Maria Klarissa Valiente.

===Cinema===
In 1987, the movie entitled ''Diwata,'' directed by Tata Esteban and written by Rei Nicandro showed the mythical life of the deities. Actress Olga Miranda played the main role, together with the other cast Lala Montelibano, Dick Israel and George Estregan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467176/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Diwata 1987|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent film ''Faraway'' focuses on a woman and her quest to find the Diwata tribe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2447338/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Games ===
In 2017, A Filipino [[Tabletop Role Playing Game]] that beautifully encapsulates local myths called Project Tadhana was released. It features Diwata as one of its playable races (or lahi) together with Engkanto, Tikbalang, Aswang, and Tao.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/technology/632378/tadhana-is-a-filipino-tabletop-rpg-that-beautifully-encapsulates-local-myths/story/|title=‘Tadhana’ is a Filipino tabletop RPG that beautifully encapsulates local myths|last=|first=|date=|website=gmanetwork|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''emergency power system''' is an independent source of electrical power that supports important electrical systems on loss of normal power supply. A standby power system may include a [[standby generator]], batteries and other apparatus. Emergency power systems are installed to protect life and property from the consequences of loss of primary electric power supply. It is a type of [[continual power system]].

They find uses in a wide variety of settings from homes to [[hospital]]s, scientific laboratories, [[data center]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.t-systems.com/tsi/servlet/content/t-systems.de/en/228788 Fuel cell in the data center Munich] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920151839/http://www.t-systems.com/tsi/servlet/content/t-systems.de/en/228788 |date=2008-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[telecommunication]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcellsworks.com/Supppage9369.html India orders 10.000 fuel cell emergency power systems]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; equipment and ships. Emergency power systems can rely on [[Engine-generator|generators]], [[deep-cycle battery|deep-cycle batteries]], [[flywheel energy storage]] or [[fuel cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/hydrogenfc_tir.pdf Fuel Cells in Backup Power Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/education/pdfs/early_markets_backup_power.pdf DOE Fuel Cells for Backup Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Emergency power systems were used as early as [[World War II]] on naval ships. In combat, a ship may lose the function of its boilers, which power the [[steam turbine]]s for the [[Electrical generator|ship's generator]]. In such a case, one or more [[diesel engine]]s are used to drive back-up generators. Early [[transfer switch]]es relied on manual operation; two switches would be placed horizontally, in line and the "on" position facing each other. a rod is placed in between. In order to operate the switch one source must be turned off, the rod moved to the other side and the other source turned on.

==Operation in buildings==
[[Image:Emergency power system in water purification plant Germany.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Emergency power [[electric generator]] in a water purification plant, driven by a [[marine propulsion]] [[diesel engine]]]]

[[Mains electricity|Mains power]] can be lost due to downed lines, malfunctions at a sub-station, inclement weather, planned [[Rolling blackout|blackouts]] or in extreme cases a [[Electric power transmission|grid]]-wide failure. In modern buildings, most emergency power systems have been and are still based on [[Electrical generator|generators]]. Usually, these generators are Diesel engine driven, although smaller buildings may use a [[gasoline engine]] driven generator and larger ones a [[gas turbine]]. However, lately, more use is being made of [[Deep cycle battery|deep cycle batteries]] and other technologies such as [[flywheel energy storage]] or [[fuel cell]]s. These latter systems do not produce polluting gases, thereby allowing the placement to be done within the building. Also, as a second advantage, they do not require a separate shed to be built for fuel storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/emergency-power3.htm|title=Advantages of deep-cycle batteries over generators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regular generators, an automatic [[transfer switch]] is used to connect emergency power. One side is connected to both the normal power feed and the emergency power feed; and the other side is connected to the load designated as emergency. If no electricity comes in on the normal side, the transfer switch uses a solenoid to throw a triple pole, single throw switch. This switches the feed from normal to emergency power. The loss of normal power also triggers a battery operated [[Automobile self starter|starter system]] to start the generator, similar to using a car battery to start an engine. Once the transfer switch is switched and the generator starts, the building's emergency power comes back on (after going off when normal power was lost).

Unlike [[emergency light]]s, emergency lighting is not a type of light fixture; it is a pattern of the building's normal lights that provides a path of lights to allow for safe exit, or lights up service areas such as mechanical rooms and electric rooms. [[Exit sign]]s, [[Fire alarm system]]s (that are not on back up batteries) and the electric motor pumps for the [[fire sprinkler]]s are almost always on emergency power. Other equipment on emergency power may include smoke isolation dampers, smoke evacuation fans, elevators, handicap doors and outlets in service areas. Hospitals use emergency power outlets to power [[life support]] systems and monitoring equipment. Some buildings may even use emergency power as part of normal operations, such as a theater using it to power show equipment because "[[the show must go on]]."

==Operation in aviation==
[[Localizer]], [[glideslope]], and other instrument landing aids (such as microwave transmitters) are both high power consumers and mission-critical, and cannot be reliably operated from a battery supply, even for short periods.  Hence, when absolute reliability is required (such as when Category 3 operations are in force at the airport) it is usual to run the system from a [[diesel generator]] with automatic switchover to the mains supply should the generator fail.  This avoids any interruption to transmission while a generator is brought up to operating speed.

This is opposed to the typical view of emergency power systems, where the backup generators are seen as secondary to the mains electrical supply.

==Electronic device protection==
Computers, communication networks, and other modern electronic devices need not only power, but also a steady flow of it to continue to operate. If the source voltage drops significantly or drops out completely, these devices will fail, even if the power loss is only for a fraction of a second. Because of this, even a generator back-up does not provide protection because of the start-up time involved.

To achieve more comprehensive loss protection, extra equipment such as [[surge protector]]s, [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]], or sometimes a complete [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) is used. UPS systems can be local (to one device or one power outlet) or may extend building-wide. A local UPS is a small box that fits under a desk or a telecom rack and powers a small number of devices. A building-wide UPS may take any of several different forms, depending on the application. It directly feeds a system of outlets designated as UPS feed and can power a large number of devices.

Since [[telephone exchange]]s use DC, the building's [[battery room]] is generally wired directly to the consuming equipment and floats continuously on the output of the rectifiers that normally supply DC rectified from utility power.  When utility power fails, the battery carries the load without needing to switch.  With this simple though somewhat expensive system, some exchanges have never lost power for a moment since the 1920s.

==Structure and operation in utility stations==
[[Image:Dores-Elect diag1.png|thumb|Diagram of a redundant power supply system.]]
In recent years, large units of a utility power station are usually designed on a unit system basis in which the required devices, including the boiler, the turbine generator unit, and its power (step up) and unit (auxiliary) [[transformer]] are solidly connected as one unit. A less common set-up consists of two units grouped together with one common station auxiliary.  As each turbine generator unit has its own attached unit auxiliary transformer, it is connected to the circuit automatically.  For starting the unit, the auxiliaries are supplied with power by another unit (auxiliary) transformer or station auxiliary transformer.  The period of switching from the first unit transformer to the next unit is designed for automatic, instantaneous operation in times when the emergency power system needs to kick in.  It is imperative that the power to unit auxiliaries not fail during a station shutdown (an occurrence known as [[Power blackout|black-out]] when all regular units temporarily fail). Instead, during shutdowns the [[Electric power transmission|grid]] is expected to remain operational.  When problems occur, it is usually due to reverse power relays and frequency-operated relays on grid lines due to severe grid disturbances.  Under these circumstances, the emergency station supply must kick in to avoid damage to any equipment and to prevent hazardous situations such as the release of [[hydrogen]] gas from generators to the local environment.

==In nuclear power plants==
{{Expert needed|energy|section|date=February 2009}}
Emergency power systems, called there Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs), are a required feature in [[nuclear power|nuclear power plants]]. They are typically installed in sets of three. The EDG installation is designed to the same safety-grade requirements as the other safety systems in the plant. The next (upcoming) generation of nuclear power plants includes some designs with multiple independent banks of EDGs (as in the [[ABWR]]s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/abwr/safe.html Simplified Active Safety Systems &lt;nowiki&gt;[for the ABWR]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906211824/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/abwr/safe.html |date=2008-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Controlling the emergency power system==
For a 208 VAC emergency supply system, a central battery system with automatic controls, located in the power station building, is used to avoid long electric supply wires.  This central battery system consists of [[lead-acid battery]] cell units to make up a 12 or 24 VDC system as well as stand-by cells, each with its own battery charging unit.  Also needed are a voltage sensing unit capable of receiving 208 VAC and an automatic system that is able to signal to and activate the emergency supply circuit in case of failure of 208 VAC station supply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14286">[[File:Energy Hierarchy.png|400px|thumbnail|right|The Energy Hierarchy with the most favoured options at the top]]
{{Sustainable energy}}

The '''Energy Hierarchy''' is a classification of [[energy]] options, prioritised to assist progress towards a more [[sustainable energy]] system. It is a similar approach to the [[waste hierarchy]] for minimising [[resource depletion]], and adopts a parallel sequence.

The highest priorities cover the prevention of unnecessary energy usage both through eliminating waste and improving [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The sustainable production of energy resources is the next priority. Depletive and waste-producing energy generation options are the lowest priority.

For an energy system to be sustainable: the resources applied to producing the energy must be capable of lasting indefinitely; [[energy conversion]] should produce no harmful by-products, including net emissions, nor wastes which cannot be fully recycled; and it must be capable of meeting reasonable energy demands.

==Energy saving==
{{main article|Energy conservation}}
The top priority under the Energy Hierarchy is energy conservation or the prevention of unnecessary [[use of energy]]. This category includes eliminating waste by turning off unneeded lights and appliances and by avoiding unnecessary [[travelling|journeys]]. [[Heat loss]] from buildings is a major source of energy wastage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartlett|first=Dave|title=The Top Ten Ways We Waste Energy And Water In Buildings|url=http://energy.aol.com/2011/07/26/the-top-ten-ways-we-waste-energy-and-water-in-buildings/|publisher=AOL Energy|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so improvements to building insulation and air-tightness can make a significant contribution to energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems|url=http://www.ecbcs.org/home.htm|work=About the ECBCS|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have agencies to encourage [[energy saving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Kingdom|title=Energy Saving Trust|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/|publisher=The Energy Saving Trust|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
The second priority under the energy hierarchy is to ensure that energy that is used is produced and consumed efficiently. [[Energy efficiency (physics)|Energy efficiency]] has two main aspects.

===Conversion efficiency of energy consumption===
{{main article|Efficient energy use}}
Energy efficiency is the ratio of the productive output of a device to the energy it consumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy efficiency definition and meaning|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/energy-efficiency.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency was a lower priority when energy was cheap and awareness of its environmental impact was low. In 1975 the average fuel economy of a car in the US was under 15 miles per gallon&lt;ref name=EPA_vehicles&gt;{{cite web|title=Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends: 1975 Through 2011|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/cert/mpg/fetrends/2012/420r12001a.pdf|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incandescent light bulbs, which were the most common type until the late 20th century, waste 90% of their energy as heat, with only 10% converted to useful light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn about LEDs|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=lighting.pr_what_are|publisher=Energy Star|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, energy efficiency has become a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Energy savings to be first policy priority for 2030|url=http://www.energy-cities.eu/IMG/pdf/20121120_press_release_Coalition_call_for_2030_energy_savings.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013|newspaper=Energy Cities (Europe)|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last reported average fuel efficiency of US cars had almost doubled from the 1975 level;&lt;ref name=EPA_vehicles /&gt; LED lighting is now being promoted which are between five and ten times more efficient than incandescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LED basics|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/sslbasics_ledbasics.html#how_efficient|work=Solid State Lighting|publisher=USDOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many household appliances are now required to display [[Energy input labeling|labels]] to show their energy efficiency.

===Conversion efficiency of energy production===
{{main article|Energy conversion efficiency}}
Losses are incurred when energy is harvested from the natural resource from which it is derived, such as fossil fuels, radioactive materials, solar radiation or other sources. Most electricity production is in thermal power stations, where much of the source energy is lost as heat. The average efficiency of world electricity production in 2009 was c.37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Energy Balance for the World|url=http://www.iea.org/stats/balancetable.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=29|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A priority in the Energy Hierarchy is to improve the efficiency of energy conversion, whether in traditional power stations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency in electricity generation|url=http://www.eurelectric.org/Download/Download.aspx?DocumentID=13549|publisher=Eurelectric|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by improving the [[Photovoltaic power station#System performance|performance ratio]] of [[Photovoltaic power stations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012|url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/downloads/pdf-files/aktuelles/photovoltaics-report.pdf|work=Photovoltaics Report|publisher=Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other energy sources.

Overall efficiency and sustainability can also be improved by capacity- or [[Climate change mitigation#Fuel switching|fuel-switching]] from less efficient, less sustainable resources to better ones; but this is mainly covered under the [[#Low impact energy production|fourth level]] of the hierarchy.

==Sustainable energy production==
{{main article|Renewable energy}}
Renewable energy describes naturally occurring, theoretically inexhaustible sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Renewable Energy|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/renewable-energy.html|publisher=Business Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources are treated as being inexhaustible, or naturally replenished, and fall into two classes.

===Elemental renewables===
The first class of renewables derive from climatic or elemental sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy |url=http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/students/options/sectors/energy/renewable/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419123506/http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/students/options/sectors/energy/renewable/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-19 |publisher=Manchester University |accessdate=23 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as sunlight, wind, waves, tides or rainfall ([[hydropower]]). [[Geothermal energy]] from the heat of the earth's core also falls in this category.

These are treated as being inexhaustible because most derive ultimately from energy emanating from the [[sun]], which has an estimated life of 6.5 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Sun's lifetime going to be?|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a10395.html|work=Ask the space scientist|publisher=NASA|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bio-energy===
The other main class of renewables, [[bioenergy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Renewable Energy|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/tech/home|publisher=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; derives from biomass, where the relatively short growing cycle means that usage is replenished by new growth. Bioenergy is usually converted by combustion, and therefore gives rise to carbon emissions. It is treated as carbon neutral overall, because an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide will have been extracted from the atmosphere during the growing cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pingoud|first=Kim|title=Harvested Wood Products|volume=4|series=IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_12_Ch12_HWP.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioenergy sources can be solid, such as wood and [[energy crop]]s; liquid, such as biofuels; or gaseous, such as biomethane from anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is bioenergy?|url=http://www.bioenergywiki.net/What_is_bioenergy|publisher=Bioenergy Wiki|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low impact energy production==
{{main article|Low carbon power}}
The next priority in the hierarchy covers energy sources that are not entirely sustainable, but have a low environmental impact. These include the use of fossil fuels with [[carbon capture and storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon dioxide capture and storage|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf|work=Technical Report|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear energy is sometimes treated as a low impact source, because it has low carbon emissions.

==High impact energy production==

The lowest priority under the energy hierarchy is energy production using unsustainables sources, such as unabated fossil fuels. Some also place nuclear energy in this category, rather than the one above, because of the required management/storage of highly hazardous [[radioactive waste]] over extremely long (hundreds of thousands of years or more) timeframes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sovacool|first=Benjamin|title=Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-4322-75-1|pages=308|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/7895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depletion of uranium resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Choi|first=Charles|title=Uranium Supply Decline Clouds Nuclear Power's Future|url=http://www.livescience.com/2463-uranium-supply-decline-clouds-nuclear-power-future.html|publisher=World Science|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a consensus that the share of such energy sources must decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An energy vision for a planet under pressure|url=http://www.igbp.net/publications/policybriefsforrio20summit/policybriefsforrio20summit/anenergyvisionforaplanetunderpressure.5.7edb9cae136f47276108000494.html|publisher=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this tier, there are possibilities for limiting adverse impacts by [[Climate change mitigation#Fuel switching|switching]] from the most damaging fuel sources, such as coal, to less emissive sources, such as gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Salovaara|first=Jackson|title=Coal to Natural Gas Fuel Switching and CO2 Emissions Reduction|work=Harvard |year=2011|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/2011/Salovaara_SeniorThesis_FINAL.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many suggest that when such high impact energy usage has been minimised, the effects of any unavoidable residual usage should be counterbalanced by emissions [[offsetting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liyanage|first=Chandratilak De Silva|title=Sustainable Energy Management and CSR|series=Encyclopedia of Corporate Social Responsibility|url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/343555.html|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the energy hierarchy==
The Energy Hierarchy was first proposed in 2005 by [[Philip Wolfe (engineer)|Philip Wolfe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=A proposed Energy Hierarchy|url=http://www.wolfeware.com/library/publications/EnergyHierarchy.pdf|publisher=WolfeWare|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was Director General of the [[Renewable Energy Association]]. This first version had three levels; energy efficiency, renewables and traditional energy production. It was endorsed and adopted in 2006 by a consortium of institutions, associations and other bodies in the Sustainable Energy Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Groups release energy 'manifesto'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4921896.stm|accessdate=23 February 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the concept has been adopted and refined by others in the energy industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Institution of Mechanical Engineers |title=The Energy Hierarchy |year=2009 |series=Energy Policy Statement |issue=09/03 |url=http://www.imeche.org/Libraries/Position_Statements-Energy/EnergyHierarchyIMechEPolicy.sflb.ashx |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625001718/http://www.imeche.org/Libraries/Position_Statements-Energy/EnergyHierarchyIMechEPolicy.sflb.ashx |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thinking differently - the energy hierarchy|url=http://www.cabe.org.uk/sustainable-places/advice/the-energy-hierarchy|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110118095356/http:/www.cabe.org.uk/sustainable-places/advice/the-energy-hierarchy|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-01-18|publisher=UK Government National Archives|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Energy Hierarchy |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/climate/sustainable_energy.jsp |work=The London Plan |publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305005446/http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/climate/sustainable_energy.jsp |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eno River State Park''' is a {{convert|4200|acre|km2|sing=on}}&lt;ref name=ParkSize /&gt; [[List of North Carolina state parks|North Carolina state park]] in [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham]] and [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange Counties]], [[North Carolina]]. Together with the adjoining [[West Point on the Eno]] city park, the two parks preserve over 9 miles (15&amp;nbsp;km) of the [[Eno River]] and surrounding lands.

There are five public access areas with features including twenty-four miles of hiking trails, canoe launches, picnic areas, and historic structures.

==Trails==
[[File:Enoturtle.jpg|thumb|left|Wildlife is plentiful in the park]]

===Buckquarter Creek===
Beginning at the parking lot for the Piper-Cox Museum, the Buckquarter Creek Trail goes up the river at Few's Ford. A staircase takes visitors to a view of the Eno River rapids down below. This {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} loop is marked by red blazes. Holden Mill loop and the Ridge Trail branch off from the Buckquarter Creek Trail.

===Cabelands===
The Cabelands Trail is {{convert|1.2|mi|km}} long and is marked by red blazes. The trail passes through the few remains of the Cabe Mill. The stretch of the river is very rocky and is usually known as Cabe's Gorge.
[[File:Enodeer.jpg|thumb|White-tailed deer as seen from the trails]]

===Cox Mountain===
The Cox Mountain Trail is marked by blue blazes. The {{convert|3.75|mi|km|adj=on}} trail passes a picnic area and crosses the suspension foot bridge. The trail goes up {{convert|270|ft|m}} in elevation and at one point follows Hillsborough Coach Road. When getting closer to Cox Mountain, the trail can get fairly steep. The trail connects to Fanny's Ford trail.

===Eno Quarry===
Eno Quarry Trail is marked by blue blazes and is a {{convert|0.42|mi|km|adj=on}} loop. In the 1960s, stone was removed from the Eno Quarry Trail to aid in construction of [[Interstate 85]]. The quarry is now the site of a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} pond. The trail has several spots that are good for fishing.

===Eno Trace===
Eno Trace is a nature trail with several information kiosks pointing out wildlife. There is a short set of steps and at one point the trail follows alongside the river.

===Fanny's Ford===
Fanny's Ford Trail is a {{convert|1.01|mi|km|adj=on}} loop and is mostly made up of flat ground and gentle hills. The trail is around the Cox Mountain trail and Hillsborough Coach Road, and at one point passes through the Few Mill's race. The trail is marked by purple blazes.

===Holden Mill===
The Holden Mill trail is a combination of two loops and is {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} long. The larger eastern loop follows the river bank for almost a mile, before climbing a {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} rise in elevation. The smaller loop is a hike around the remains of Holden's Mill, but also follows the river at parts. It is marked by yellow blazes.

===Shakori===
The Shakori Trail is a scenic {{convert|1.04|mi|km|adj=on}} hike marked by yellow U-shaped blazes. Hikers can view the remains of a 19th-century house and an old saw mill site. There is a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} elevation change. [[File:Enosnow1.jpg|thumb|View from Laurel Bluffs trail]]

===Laurel Bluffs===
This trail starts at an intersection with the Pump Station Trail and goes east to Guess Road. It is {{convert|2.49|mi|km}} long and generally stays close to the river except for short sections where cliffs and bluffs force it up and around on ridges. The trail passes the chimney and foundation of an old hunting lodge, the mostly-intact Guess Mill Dam, enters the millrace and comes out at the chimney at the Guess Mill site. Future plans are for Laurel Bluffs Trail to extend west to Cabelands Trail and to connect with West Point on the Eno city park trails. This connection will be a component of the [[Mountains-to-Sea Trail]].

===Pump Station===
The Pump Station Trail is known as the best spring wildflower trail in the park. It begins at the Nancy Rhodes Creek bridge on Rivermont Road and makes a {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} loop. It is generally an easy hike with only a few gentle hills. The foundations of Durham’s first water pumping station are near the river at the northeast section of the loop.

==History==
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Eno (people)|Eno]], [[Shakori Tribe|Shakori]] and [[Occoneechee]] tribes lived along the river prior to European settlement. Some of the tribes merged in the late 17th century and established a village near present-day Durham.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Settlers moved to the area later to set up farms and gristmills. More than thirty mills were located on the Eno River. By the 1940s the last of the mills ceased operations.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Efforts to protect the Eno River started in 1965 when the city of Durham proposed building a reservoir in the river valley. Concerned citizens led a campaign to save the Eno and formed the Association for the Preservation of the Eno River Valley. The association proposed the establishment of a state park and, in May 1972, the state of North Carolina approved the idea. In 1975, the state—with help from the Eno River Association and the Nature Conservancy—acquired more than 1,000 acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²) of land for the park.

==The Eno River Association==
The Eno River Association was established in 1966 and played an important role in creating the park. Since its inception it has purchased more than 4900 acres (20&amp;nbsp;km²) for the park. As a part of its conservation role the group engages in public outreach, notably producing the annual Festival for the Eno.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

The Festival for the Eno brings an average 30,000 visitors during three days in July. The festival includes music, crafts, food, and promotes environmental awareness. The proceeds are a major source of funding for the Eno River Association.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Eno River Association |url=http://www.enoriver.org/eno/About/index.html |title=About the Eno River Association |accessdate=July 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706083222/http://www.enoriver.org/eno/About/index.html |archivedate=July 6, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waters |first=Rob |date=June 30, 2007 |url=http://www.thedurhamnews.com/viewpoints/story/68948.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203190122/http://www.thedurhamnews.com/viewpoints/story/68948.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |title=Eno River deserves a festival |work=The Durham News |accessdate=July 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Food Justice Movement''' is a [[grassroots]] initiative emerging from communities in response to food insecurity and economic pressures that prevent access to healthy, nutritious, and culturally appropriate foods.&lt;ref name="Alkon_2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultivating Food Justice: Race, Class, and Sustainability|date=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262516327|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts| vauthors = Alkon AH, Agyeman J  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes more broad policy movements, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Food justice "demands recognition of human rights, equal opportunity, and fair treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayes CR, Carbone ET | year = 2015 | title =  Food Justice: What is it? Where has it been? Where is it going?. | journal = Journal of Nutritional Disorders and Therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognizes the food system as "a racial project and problematizes the influence of race and class on the production, distribution and consumption of food".&lt;ref name="Alkon_2011" /&gt; This encompasses farm labor work, land disputes, issues of status and class, environmental justice, public politics and advocacy.&lt;ref name="Alkon_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sbicca_2018"&gt;{{cite book|title=Food Justice Now!: Deepening the Roots of Social Struggle|date=2018|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9781517904012|location=Minneapolis, MN | vauthors = Sbicca, J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food justice is closely connected to [[Food sovereignty]], which critiques “structural barriers communities of color face to accessing local and organic foods” that are largely due to institutional racism and the effect it has on economic equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | vauthors = Alkon AH, Agyeman J | year = 2011 | title = Cultivating Food Justice: Race, Class, and Sustainability. | location = Cambridge, Mass. | publisher = MIT Press | isbn = 9780262516327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that lack of access to good food is both a cause and a symptom of the structural inequalities that divide society. Community gardens in poor areas are seen as part of the solution, as well as addressing equity issues in both the decision making process and the distribution of resources.

==Background==
The modern Food Justice movement grew out of the [[Community Food Security Coalition]] (CFSC) in 1996, which sought to provide affordable, culturally appropriate, healthy food to Americans. A shortcoming of this group, was that it was composed entirely of white Americans, and accepted little input from residents of the food insecure areas the CFSC was trying to support.[[Food Justice Movement#cite note-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] It emphasized the consumption of local and fresh fruits and vegetables, and removed race from the conversation. Director of Nuestras Raices Daniel Ross points out that:&lt;blockquote&gt;…food security cannot be divorced from the issues of concern to communities […] food and agriculture lends itself to addressing [racism and power imbalances] because food is so central to communities and, if you had working communities, you'd have justice and equality. […] At the heart is the element of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Slocum | first = Rachel | date = 2015 | title = Notes on the practice of food justice in the U.S.: understanding and confronting trauma and inequity | url = http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_22/Slocumcadieux.pdf | journal = Journal of Political Ecology | volume = 22 | pages =  | via =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other scholars who have done research in food justice and related topics include Monica M. White whose research is focused on the primarily black community in Detroit. In her article Sisters of the Soil: Urban Gardening as Resistance in Detroit, she discusses the work of the [[Detroit Black Community Food Security Network]] (DBCFSN) that uses farming as a way to alleviate food insecurity and make political statements. White cites the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 2005-2006 to point out that 52.9% of black women are obese,  compared to 37.2% of black men and 32.9% of white women due to phenomena like food deserts and food insecurity. Because the socioeconomic status of black communities in Detroit are a huge part of the food insecurity issues black communities face, this serves as an example for the inseparability of food justice movements and social reform.&lt;ref&gt;White, Monica M. “Sisters of the Soil: Urban Gardening as Resistance in Detroit.” ''Race/Ethnicity: Multidisciplinary Global Contexts'', vol. 5, no. 1, 2011, pp. 13–28. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/racethmulglocon.5.1.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 25 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medial care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."

The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations states that the right to food is "The right to feed oneself in dignity. It is the right to have continuous access to the resources that will enable you to produce, earn or purchase enough food to not only prevent hunger, but also to ensure health and well-being. The right to food only rarely means that a person has the right to free handouts." &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Right to Food Unit. Right to Food Questions and Answers. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Chocolate of Peace is a part of the food justice movement. It is the work of a British-Columbian team who believe in transformative power. They are a group of victims of the armed conflict and have been using grassroots for twenty years to create peace. However, the government of Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC-EP guerrilla is hard to make negotiations with and even though the Community's efforts are noticed in international human rights circles, many Columbians are unaware of the peace movement.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) which is apart of USDA's Research, Education, and Economics mission area (REE),  NIFA is an agency that uses federal funding in order to address agricultural and food justice related issues that impact peoples daily lives. This is a collaborative effort that uses scientists and research in order to locate and find solutions to issues in the agricultural chain. They use science-policy decision making, something to keep in mind when asking what problems are being fixed and for what purpose.&lt;ref&gt;NIFA.org "About NIFA" (https://nifa.usda.gov/about-nifa)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and theory ==
There is a plethora of research pertaining to community gardens, urban farming, and their impact on local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golden|first=Sheila | name-list-format = vanc |date=November 13, 2013|title=Urban Agriculture Impacts: Social, Health, and Economic - A Literature Review|url=|journal=UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature tries to connect the activities of community gardens and urban agricultural projects to social, health, and economic outcomes. However, due to the overwhelming lack of diversity in the perspectives that inform the food justice movement, a new concept of ''just sustainability''&lt;ref name="Alkon_2011" /&gt; has been proposed. To address white and middle class culture dominating the discussion and priorities of organic food and sustainability practices, a more multi-cultural and intersectional approach is suggested that includes the narratives of historically marginalized communities.&lt;ref name="Alkon_2011" /&gt;

=== Food Movements and Race/History. ===
Positionality and the different food movement perspectives. “Pollan’s analysis presumes that food-ways are individual choices removed from their social and economic constraints. In a critique rooted in the environmental justice movement, food justice activists demonstrate that institutional racism, in its intersections with economic inequality, has stripped communities of color of their local food sovereignty, preventing them from eating in the way the food movement describes as proper. By aiming their critique at the structural barriers communities of color face to accessing local and organic food, the food justice movement hopes to craft collective racial and cultural identities through the celebration of particular foods while reaching out to those whose food-ways still reflect the dominance of American agribusiness.”&lt;ref name="Alkon_2011" /&gt;

== Food Justice and Policy ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
According to Wekerle, food justice has emerged as a way of applying food security and anti-hunger movements to policy. “Theoretically, the food justice frame opens up linkages to a wider range of conceptual frameworks drawn from the literature on democracy, citizenship, social movements, and social and environmental justice.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wekerle|first=Gerda R.|date=June 1, 2004|title=Food Justice Movements: Policy, Planning, and Networks|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=378–386|doi=10.1177/0739456X04264886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Food justice emerged as a way of applying food security and anti-hunger movements to policy by drawing from established social and environmental theoretical frameworks. 
The food justice movement is related to food sovereignty in that it critiques “structural barriers communities of color face to accessing local and organic foods” (Alkon et al) that are largely due to institutional racism and the effect it has on economic equality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Fighting for family farmers to keep and sustain their land, or ensuring access to healthy foods to those previously denied affordable nourishment, there are many ways folks contribute to remedy the accessibility of quality of food in the US. Listed below are a few organizations around the world expanding the vision of food justice and pursuing tangible

Organizations and festivals such as the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]], Familias Unidas por la Justicia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVMzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=%22Familias+Unidas+por+la+Justicia%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Familias%20Unidas%20por%20la%20Justicia%22&amp;f=false|title=Mexican-Origin Foods, Foodways, and Social Movements: Decolonial Perspectives|last=Peña|first=Devon|last2=Calvo|first2=Luz|last3=McFarland|first3=Pancho|last4=Valle|first4=Gabriel R.|date=2017-09-01|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=9781610756181|location=|pages=274–276|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Farm Aid]] are credited as working to raise awareness of or assist with food justice by fighting for family farmers to keep and sustain their land, fair pay and treatment of workers, and ensuring access to healthy foods to those previously denied affordable nourishment.

== Food Deserts ==
{{main|Food desert}}{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

Food deserts are a phenomenon described as geographic areas wherein there is a lack of access to food supply, such as a typical chain grocery store within reachable distance. In a so called food desert, it is typical that liquor stores with no fresh food, only offering bagged chips, sodas, and other quick eat items that lack nutritional substance, are available, alongside fast food restaurants who lack healthy options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodispower.org/food-deserts/|title=Food Deserts {{!}} Food Empowerment Project|website=www.foodispower.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Report to Congress done by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], it was found that 23.5 million Americans live more than one mile away from a grocery store and do not have access to a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/42711/12716_ap036_1_.pdf?v=41055|title=Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences|last=USDA|date=June 2009|website=Economic Research Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While public transportation can help bridge the gap and get individuals living in a food market to a grocery store, economic factors have pushed many local stores out of business requiring some individuals to take many buses or trains just to gain access to a sub-par market.

Although access to healthy foods is beneficial, it is important to consider that the communities in which markets serve are disadvantaged in the economic sphere. If the cost of fruits and vegetables do not meet consumer budgets, they will not purchase them.

=== From Food Deserts to Food Apartheid ===

Recently, anthropologists studying diet and culture, have re-termed food deserts, into Food apartheid. The change in colloquial term has been made to represent that “food deserts” are not desolate, empty neighborhoods, but are neighborhoods who have been deemed to be unworthy of having access to nutritious food. Food apartheid is a form of [[apartheid]] because in most cases, the lack of availability  of healthy food disproportionately affects communities of color.  According to Jacqueline Bediako, food apartheid affects people of all races, including poor white people, although Black and brown people are affected disproportionately. Under these conditions — which are overtly abusive — whole communities are geographically and economically isolated from healthy food options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/15/food-apartheid-food-deserts-racism-inequality-america-karen-washington-interview|title=Food Apartheid: the root of the problem with America's groceries|last=Brones|first=Anna | name-list-format = vanc |date=15 May 2018|archive-url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/15/food-apartheid-food-deserts-racism-inequality-america-karen-washington-interview|archive-date=15 May 2018|dead-url=|access-date=|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food Mirages and Food Swamps ===

While food deserts have been used as a blanket term to describe food deserts, food mirages, and food swamps, they are not synonymous and they all differ in how they relate to the access of food.

To further support that prices play a key role in the consumption of healthy foods, the term "food mirage" has been used to describes low-income communities with access to supermarkets but with financial barriers to access those healthy foods.&lt;ref name = "Breyer_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Breyer B, Voss-Andreae A | title = Food mirages: geographic and economic barriers to healthful food access in Portland, Oregon | journal = Health &amp; Place | volume = 24 | pages = 131–9 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24100236 | doi = 10.1016/j.healthplace.2013.07.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study done by researchers at [[Portland State University]], a food mirage was examined in a neighborhood where residents living in poverty were surrounded by new grocery stores. Researchers found that out of the 81% of impoverished residents surveyed, 61% percent lived in moderate or extreme food mirage. Resulting in traveling more than 1.8 miles past their neighborhood grocery store in search of better prices.&lt;ref name = "Breyer_2013" /&gt;

While food deserts are often assessed by the distance in miles between individuals' homes and supermarkets, and food mirages assess price and poverty relativity, food swamps differ in that they are described as geographic areas with a high density of establishments that sell high calorie "fast food" and "junk food".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooksey-Stowers K, Schwartz MB, Brownell KD | title = Food Swamps Predict Obesity Rates Better Than Food Deserts in the United States | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 1366 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29135909 | pmc = 5708005 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph14111366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive review of research done on food swamps by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], has found that 10 out of 12 studies provided evidence that fast food restaurants are more likely to locate in areas where there are higher concentrations of ethnic minorities than areas populated by Whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fleischhacker SE, Evenson KR, Rodriguez DA, Ammerman AS | title = A systematic review of fast food access studies | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = e460–71 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 20149118 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2010.00715.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structural Inequities that Created Disparity ==
The relationship between food environments and its effects on obesity have been examined and have revealed to play a major role in the contribution to health disparities, particularly the presence of fast food restaurants and convenience stores. In neighborhoods that have access barriers to supermarkets because of proximity or prices, consumers are left with only two options; convenience stores and fast food restaurants. Low-income communities that are “lacking healthy food access—can simultaneously be ‘food swamps,’ consisting in a saturation of access to unhealthy food (e.g., fast-food, convenience stores) and nonfood (e.g., gas stations) venues, characterized by calorie-dense and high-sugared food items”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=David | name-list-format = vanc |date=May 2015|title=The Food Environment Is a Complex Social Network|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=133|pages=202–204|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; these environments reinforce unhealthy behaviors among residents. Currently, there are few policies that look at the food environment, beyond food deserts, in disadvantaged neighborhoods. In one intervention by Los Angeles policymakers, a zone ordinance that banned new free standing fast food restaurants overlooked the complexities of low-income environments. Rather than focusing on limiting specific types of fast food restaurants and convenience stores, the policy left many loopholes that allowed establishments like McDonald's to open among strip malls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sturm R, Hattori A | title = Diet and obesity in Los Angeles County 2007-2012: Is there a measurable effect of the 2008 "Fast-Food Ban"? | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 133 | pages = 205–11 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25779774 | pmc = 4410074 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.03.004 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953615001409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strip malls are abundant in low-income communities, they are attractive to fast food restaurants because of lower rents and greater access to consumers. Although it was one of the first attempts, this demonstrates the importance of creating research based policies that clearly examine the complexities of low-income neighborhoods to address health disparities.

It has been argued{{By whom|date=June 2018}} that living within close proximity of fast-food restaurants increases the consumption of high calorie foods. For example, in one study, results indicated that “Fast food establishments within both a quarter and half mile had a statistically significant negative relationship with fruit and vegetable consumption,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeDoux|first=Timothy F.|last2=Vojnovic|first2=Igor | name-list-format = vanc |date= December 2014 | title = Examining the role between the residential neighborhood food environment and diet among low-income households in Detroit, Michigan |journal=Applied Geography|volume=55|pages=9–18|doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;” meaning that the easier access a resident had to fast food, the least likely they were to consume fruits and vegetables. Moreover, it is known that fast food restaurants provide inexpensive meals, making them highly attractive to low-income consumers. Using Geo-coded information, a study for the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health|Harvard School of Public Health]], found evidence indicating that fast-food restaurants are more prevalent in minority neighborhoods, which are often low-income neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = James P, Arcaya MC, Parker DM, Tucker-Seeley RD, Subramanian SV | title = Do minority and poor neighborhoods have higher access to fast-food restaurants in the United States? | journal = Health &amp; Place | volume = 29 | pages = 10–7 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24945103 | pmc = 4783380 | doi = 10.1016/j.healthplace.2014.04.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If food prices have  shown to make an impact on food choices among under-served communities, it would make sense{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} that the low cost of fast food would be appealing to consumers in low-income communities. Unfortunately, the low cost of fast-food comes at another price, fast food is high in calories and unhealthy fats, like processed food in convenience stores or supermarkets, consuming these foods puts one at risk of obesity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}}

Many residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods rely on fast and convenient foods, corner stores such as liquor stores are abundant in low-income communities. Convenience stores carry foods that are highly processed to extend shelf life, resulting in an abundance of calories, fat, sugar and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown DR, Brewster LG | title = The food environment is a complex social network | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 133 | pages = 202–4 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25863975 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.03.058 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953615002208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, consumers turn to convenience stores because they accept government assistance programs such as SNAP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover RV, Lambert EV | title = "Choice Set" for health behavior in choice-constrained settings to frame research and inform policy: examples of food consumption, obesity and food security | journal = International Journal for Equity in Health | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 48 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26984387 | pmc = 4793539 | doi = 10.1186/s12939-016-0336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; further perpetuating unhealthy behaviors in food choice and the significance of redesigning food policies. Another reason convenience store foods are appealing to those living in low-income communities is that those living with food insecurity require to stretch their food, processed foods do not require refrigeration and last longer than perishable foods. By considering how food environments affect low income communities, policymakers can make better informed decisions on how policies can address contributing factors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Residential Segregation Leads to Commercial Flight ===

Food apartheid and the lack of access to food are the results of racist politicking and they stem from socioeconomic injustices that disproportionately affect low income Black communities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]—food deserts are the direct manifestation of structural inequities that have been solidified over time. These institutional racisms that have resulted in a lack of access to healthy food for minorities are innumerable—but among them include housing policies leading to segregated communities and financial policies leading to commercial flight. These policies have all interacted over time to contribute to health disparities among the Black community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.racialjusticeproject.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2012/06/NYLS-Food-Deserts-Report.pdf|title=Unshared Bounty: How Structural Racism Contributes to the Creation and Persistence of Food Deserts|last=New York Law School|first=ACLU|date=13 May 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1962, 61% of white Americans shared the sentiment that “white people[possessed] a right to keep blacks out of their neighborhoods if they [wanted] to, and blacks should respect that right.” &lt;ref&gt;James H. Carr and Nandinee K. Kutty, The New Imperative for Equality, in Segregation: The Rising Cost for Americans 40, 68 (James H. Carr &amp; Nandinee K. Kutty, eds., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite years of policy changes a result of the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], 30 years later in 1990, a Detroit survey of whites found that a quarter of white respondents would not move into a neighborhood that was more than 50% Black.&lt;ref name="huduser"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/em/spring14/highlight1.html|title=Expanding Opportunity Through Fair Housing Choice {{!}} HUD USER|website=www.huduser.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination towards Blacks continues to influence real estate practices, while public policies and institutional discrimination continue to reinforce race segregated living patterns. Although segregation by race is illegal, it has not ceased to be the standard in America. Living patterns are not only correlated with access to educational opportunities, and employment opportunities—they are also correlated to access to food.&lt;ref name="huduser" /&gt;

Studies published by [https://www.ajpmonline.org/ American Journal of Preventative Medicine] have found that low-income neighborhoods and minority neighborhoods are less likely to have access to large supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Larson NI, Story MT, Nelson MC | title = Neighborhood environments: disparities in access to healthy foods in the U.S | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 74–81 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18977112 | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.09.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal government policies have directly hindered the development of supermarkets in Black populated communities. As middle-income whites got subsidized government loans to move from cities to suburbia, businesses, including supermarkets, relocated with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/7521750|title=Segregation : the rising costs for America in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07|isbn=9780415965347|last1=Carr|first1=James H.|last2=Kutty|first2=Nandinee K.|last3=Smith|first3=Shanna L.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grocery stores and retailers alike, were supported by the United States government to relocate to the suburbs—catering to the White middle class and leaving the cities desolate.

== Health Outcomes Related to Nutrition in Communities of Color ==
Although causal relationships between food habits and substandard health have not been exclusively made, it is well accepted{{By whom|date=June 2018}} that there is a definitely a correlation between the two.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Since communities of color are disproportionately affected by food apartheid, it is no shock that Black Americans and Hispanics suffer from rates of obesity at 45% and 36.8%, respectively—which is comparatively higher than the white rate of obesity at 30%. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers For Disease Control]], obesity has been linked to a wide range of health problems including [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 Diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]]s, various types of cancer, [[hypertension]], and high cholesterol among both adults and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/aag/NCCDPHP.htm|title=National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion {{!}} At A Glance Reports {{!}} Publications {{!}} Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion {{!}} CDC|date=2017-10-02|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 study done by medical doctors and public health professionals of New York’s [[Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai]], a community coalition study was done to compare the availability and cost of diabetes-healthy foods in a Black populated neighborhood in East Harlem with that of the adjacent White, wealthy Upper East Side in New York City. Researched surveyed 173 East Harlem and 152 Upper East Side grocery stores to find whether or not they stocked 5 basic diabetes-diet recommended foods. Results showed that only 18% of East Harlem stores stocked the recommended foods, compared with 58% of stores in the Upper East Side. Further, they found that only 9% of East Harlem bodegas (convenience stores) carried all 5 recommended items while 48% of Upper East Side bodegas carried the items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horowitz CR, Colson KA, Hebert PL, Lancaster K | title = Barriers to buying healthy foods for people with diabetes: evidence of environmental disparities | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 94 | issue = 9 | pages = 1549–54 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15333313 | pmc = 1448492 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy is huge{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}, and is a representation of many communities in America. Since health conditions such diabetes are more prevalent in Black communities than White communities, this creates a cycle in which type 2 diabetes continues to thrive.

=== Victim Blaming ===

In recent times policymakers{{Like whom?|date=June 2018}} have acknowledged that access to food disproportionately affects minority communities, yet their victim blaming narratives however suggest that some disparity in food access stem from choice. For example, an article published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]], Economic Research Service entitled “Access to Affordable, Nutritious Food is Limited in “Food Deserts,” it is explained that consumers’ demographic and economic characteristics, buying habits, and tastes can explain why stores do not locate in some areas or carry particularly healthy foods. This argument blames the communities themselves for the lack of access to healthy food and fails to acknowledge the historical influences and governmental policies that have marginalized these minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2010/march/access-to-affordable-nutritious-food-is-limited-in-food-deserts/|title=USDA ERS - Access to Affordable, Nutritious Food Is Limited in "Food Deserts"|website=www.ers.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Food sovereignty|Food Sovereignty]] and the Global South ==
The issue of Food justice is not a foreign concept as the global south epitomizes the situation of how the lack of resources can have dire consequences. There are several factors that come into play one is that higher prices for affect the global poor.&lt;ref name = "Cadieux_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cadieux|first1=Kirsten|last2=Slocum|first2=Rachel | name-list-format = vanc |title=What does it mean to do food justice?|journal=Journal of Political Ecology|date=2015|volume=22|pages=3|url=http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_22/Cadieuxslocum.pdf|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However each region is affected in different ways causing the food justice movement to take different forms. For instance, Food sovereignty revolves around the issues of , “self determination, global uneven development, and ecological degradation,” and commonly associated with the global south and rural U.S.&lt;ref name = "Cadieux_2015" /&gt; Food justice on the other hand is mostly concentrated within developed nations such as the U.S. and Canada and its issues revolves around inaccessibility and consumption of healthy food.&lt;ref name = "Cadieux_2015" /&gt; Other common issues within food sovereignty include not enough food due to issues of scarcity, environmental factors, as well as population and allocation a lot of these factors also correlate to the lack of rights to land of indigenous and small scale farmers.&lt;ref name = "Cadieux_2015" /&gt; Colonialism is also a big source to much food insecurity both in the present and in the past. colonialism had a direct impact on those especially in the african continent who depended on seasonal farming due to prolonged droughts in certain regions, however, British policy made important pasture and water resources, during these critical times, legally inaccessible.&lt;ref name = "Oba_1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oba |first1=Gufu | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ecological Factors in Land Use Conflicts, Land Administration and Food Insecurity in Turkana, Kenya |journal=ODI Pastoral Development Network Paper |date=December 1992 |pages=10 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.536.1825 |url=https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/5389.pdf |access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The food riots of 2007 and 2008, are very much reminiscent of the colonial past as todays food regime led to the inflation of food prices as more cropland was aggregated for biofuels and feed crops for animals displacing land available for food crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMichael |first1=Philip |title=A food regime analysis of the 'world food crisis' |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |date=31 July 2009 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=281–295 |doi=10.1007/s10460-009-9218-5 |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10460-009-9218-5.pdf |access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Muna Lakhani notes that this practice occurred under colonialism, where African farmers had to grow cash crops for export, over planting crops that would be able to feed their families.&lt;ref name = "Alfreds_2011"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alfreds |first1=Duncan | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Colonialism legacy 'haunts' food production |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/Colonialism-legacy-haunts-food-production-News-24.pdf |access-date=4 June 2018 |work=News24 |agency=24Media |date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, this trend continues as over consumption by 25% of the global population, predominantly western nations, consume 80% of the resources.&lt;ref name = "Alfreds_2011" /&gt; This reeping of land and resources which either creature barries or detroys the local ecosystem then forces many of these developing nations and tribes to become dependent on food aid from these post colonial nations.&lt;ref name = "Oba_1992" /&gt; Although food justice is in a different region and is racially bound, they both aim to achieve an end to food insecurity. Together both movements help to bridge a gap between institutional divides that the food movement as a whole has not been able to achieve.&lt;ref name = "Cadieux_2015" /&gt;

== Possible Solutions ==
Food insecurity recognized as one of the world's current most pressing issues. In fact, agricultural food scientists and corporations argue that responding to the issue using food justice practices is not sufficient in regards to the urgency of the issue.&lt;ref name = "Cadieux_2015" /&gt; Such argumentation is the basis for defending the use of GMOs to feed the world. However research from scholars, farmers, and NGO’s go to disprove this by presenting that smaller scale farming has been proven to be not only environmentally friendly but can in fact ‘feed the world.’&lt;ref name = "Cadieux_2015" /&gt;

=== Urban/Community farms ===
One of the first tactics to battle the food injustice and scarcity found in both rural and urban areas is by the use of community or urban gardens. Community gardens, according to the American Community Gardening Association’s (ACGA) mission statement, are essential catalysts for the neighborhood and surrounding community by not only helping combat food insecurity in providing healthy food options but it is also economically and environmentally sound, these gardens also provide a source for recreation, therapy, beauty and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Community Gardening Association|title=Growign Community Across the U.S. and Canada|url=https://communitygarden.org/mission/|website=Community Garden|publisher=American Community Gardening Association|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, having communal gardens may also benefit immigrants and refugees who use gardening as a tactic to immerse themselves in new surroundings while also getting a chance to reconnect with their culture and receive food for their family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=American Community Gardening Association|title=2015 Annual Report|date=2016|pages=10|url=https://communitygarden.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Annual-Report-2015.pdf|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This epitomizes how the Center for Rural Affairs sees the working of the community food system of which may take many forms but at its core aims to, form a connection between the producers locals who grow or make the food and the consumers, the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Center For Rural Affairs|title=Community Food|url=http://www.cfra.org/community-food|website=CFRA|publisher=Center For Rural Affairs|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the great change and development community gardens bring, many in these communities had to fight for the right to use the land for gardening which was evident in the 1960's with "guerrilla gardening" tactics to combat land scarcity and resist the, "inequalities between the powerful and powerless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baudry |first1=Sandrine |title=Reclaiming Urban Space as Resistance: The Infrapolitics of Gardening |journal=Revue Française d'Études Américaines |volume=131 |date=2012 |issue=131 |pages=35–36 |doi=10.3917/rfea.131.0032 |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-francaise-d-etudes-americaines-2012-1-page-32.htm |access-date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, according to the ACGA annual report, 61% of community or urban gardens are found on government lands, indicating the important role local governments play in the allowing or blocking the use of community gardens through the implementation of opposing legislation or strict land use policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=American Community Gardening Association|title=2015 Annual Report|date=2016|pages=9|url=https://communitygarden.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Annual-Report-2015.pdf|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Produce Availability ===
Equity in both the decision making process and the distribution of resources is the core of the food justice movement and can be achieved through government policies. One possible course of action to combat food deserts may be in mandating that corner stores and such in food deserts provide some variation of fruits and vegetables. For instance in Minneapolis :the Department of Health and Family Support understood that residents in food deserts find themselves purchasing their staple foods from corner stores, unable to travel to grocery stores or ‘local’ farmers markets, however more often than not convenience stores carry more unhealthy quick foods rather than fresh produce.&lt;ref name = "MDHFS"&gt;{{cite web | title = Minneapolis Healthy Corner Store Program Making produce more visible, affordable and attractive |date=2012 |publisher=Minneapolis Department of Health and Family Support |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |pages=3 |url=http://www.minneapolismn.gov/www/groups/public/@health/documents/webcontent/wcms1p-095276.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this issue the Minneapolis City Council passed an ordinance requiring Minneapolis corner stores to carry, “five varieties of perishable produce” and the Minnesota Department of Health requires, “WIC-certified stores to carry a minimum of seven varieties (and thirty pounds) of fresh produce.”&lt;ref name = "MDHFS"/&gt;{{rp|3}} However even with the ordinances North Minneapolis residents who, "shopped most often at corner stores...did not purchase produce from them,” due to factors such as produce being out of site or not fresh.&lt;ref name = "MDHFS"/&gt;{{rp|3}} This indicates however that ordinances as such may not always be enough. In the case of Minneapolis, the MDHFS created the Healthy Corner Store Program to ensure the success of the ordinance by providing assistance from a grocery store consultant to store owners to, “making healthy foods and fresh produce more visible, affordable, and attractive to neighborhood residents.”&lt;ref name = "MDHFS"/&gt;{{rp|4}}
Another possible solution to food injustices and specifically food injustice, may be in making new regulations providing that there be more grocery stores in urban and rural areas. The USDA also sees this as an issue in stating that 2.2 million Americans have difficulty in accessing large grocery stores due to have to travel over a mile in urban areas or more than 10 in urban areas may increase reliance on convenience stores and restaurants(fast food), resulting in a poor diet and diet-related health problems.&lt;ref name = "Breneman_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breneman |first1=Vince |last2=Farrigan |first2=Tracy |last3=Hamrick |first3=Karen |last4=Hopkins |first4=David | name-list-format = vanc |title=Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences |journal=Report to Congress |date=2009 |issue=June |pages=iii |url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/42711/12716_ap036_1_.pdf?v=41055 |access-date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA recognizes that the limited food access in Urban core areas, “are characterized by higher levels of racial segregation and greater income inequality.” In small-town and rural areas with limited the lack of transportation infrastructure.”&lt;ref name = "Breneman_2009" /&gt;
However not all chain groceries will go into small neighborhoods due to the risk and upkeep, For places like West Oakland in California, where just about half the residents don’t have a car, access to grocery stores is even more so a struggle, so Brahm Ahmadi, decided to open his own full service grocery store na health center by selling bonds directly to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Finz |first1=Stacy |title=West Oakland supermarket shops for funds Food Stock for planned grocery store, much needed in West Oakland, being sold in direct public offering |url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/West-Oakland-supermarket-shops-for-funds-4292021.php#ixzz2LSi1Y6bg |access-date=14 May 2018 |work=SFGate |agency=Hearst Communications |date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food Vending ===
Food trucks and other local services provide another option to help provide food to food deserts and other rural areas. In some places these food trucks like the Second Harvest Food Bank's Produce Mobile Program help communities and neighborhoods in need by providing them with high-quality and fresh produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Second Harvest Food Bank |title=Produce Mobile Program |url=https://www.shfb.org/producemobile |website=Second Harvest Food Bank |access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food trucks are another important source of food, and are unique in their mobilitiy but also in their locations.Food trucks are found in cities, towns, and universities all over the United States and Canada although they have a longer history in places like Portland where there was little laws preventing them or Los Angeles where immigrants carried on traditions.&lt;ref name = "Ferguson_2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Laura | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 2018 |title=Food Trucks as a Force for Social Justice |url=https://now.tufts.edu/articles/food-trucks-force-social-justice |website=Tufts Now |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other spaces for these vendors became fairly recent in places like Montreal where trucks and cultural spaces were previously regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Laura |title=Food Trucks as a Force for Social Justice |url=https://now.tufts.edu/articles/food-trucks-force-social-justice |website=Tufts Now |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=6 June 2018|date=2018-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often overlooked because they may not always supply the most ‘healthy’ food, they help combat food insecurity by supplying food to communities that either have no other means of getting food or simply bringing more food options into the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reese |first1=Ashante |title=Between a Corner Store and a Safeway: Navigating the Unequal Foodscape in Washington, D.C |date=20 November 2015 |url=https://aaa.confex.com/aaa/2015/webprogram/Paper49609.html |access-date=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food trucks have also been labeled, “powerful affirmation of pop-up urbanism,” that are controlled by ordinary people creating culturally different and creative spaces.&lt;ref name = "Ferguson_2018" /&gt;  However, food trucks and other street vendors have often been banned by cities if they did not have permits or if they were considered a competitive threat to establishments nearby.&lt;ref name = "Powers_2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Powers |first1=Matt | name-list-format = vanc | date = February 2018 |title=California and Arizona File Bills to Legalize Vending Trades |url=http://ij.org/california-arizona-file-bills-legalize-vending-trades/ |website=Institute for Justice |publisher=Institute for Justice |access-date=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet recently, new legislation in California (SB946)and Arizona ( HB 2371) are aimed to not only legalize food trucks state wide but also decriminalize the sidewalk vending.&lt;ref name = "Powers_2018" /&gt; Legislation like these will not only help to boost the local economy but it will also allow vendors to safely and securely provide food to the community.However food trucks are not just an American or Western phenomenon, they are part of a phenomenon that has been quite common in much of the Global South.&lt;ref name = "Ferguson_2018" /&gt; Food vending in the Global South slightly differs as food vending enables many to simply survive, hang on, and cope with urban towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muzvidziwa |first1=Victor |title=Food Vending: Adaptation Under Difficult Circumstances |journal=Journal of Social Development in Africa |date=July 2000 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=69–70 |url=http://pdfproc.lib.msu.edu/?file=/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/social%20development/vol15no2/jsda015002005.pdf |access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows them to develop networks and strategies to get by in these towns by forming relationships with commercial and small-holder irrigation farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muzvidziwa |first1=Victor |title=Food Vending: Adaptation Under Difficult Circumstances |journal=Journal of Social Development in Africa |date=July 2000 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=70 |url=http://pdfproc.lib.msu.edu/?file=/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/social%20development/vol15no2/jsda015002005.pdf |access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food delivery services are another way from either local grocery stores or market boxes sent to your door. However, some of these tend to be expensive or require internet accessibility to control your account, depending on the community especially those in rural areas this option may not be possible.

==== SNAP and other Food Assistance Programs ====

Another solution to potentially combat the food injustice,both in terms of quality and quantity of food, is in government provided subsidies and vouchers to help alleviate financial burden in affording food, as well as making healthier options available.The U.S. Federal government, as many other governments has put in much of its resources, approximately 50 billion dollars per year towards nutrition assistance programs.&lt;ref name="Chilton M 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chilton M, Rose D | title = A rights-based approach to food insecurity in the United States | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 1203–11 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19443834 | pmc = 2696644 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2007.130229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Snap is one of these programs, mitigated by the federal government under the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) in the 1960's that according to one of their publications, “improves health, enhances self-sufficiency, and alleviates food insecurity.”&lt;ref name = "Danielson_2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Danielson |first1=Caroline | name-list-format = vanc | date = February 2018 |title=The CalFresh Food Assistance Program |url=http://www.ppic.org/publication/the-calfresh-food-assistance-program/ |website=Public Policy Institute of California |publisher=Public Policy Institute of California |access-date=13 May  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Policy Institute has conducted research showing that since the introduction of food stamps, they have reduced illnesses attributed to poor diet such as diabetes and increased average birth weights among adults who had access to the program from youth.&lt;ref name = "Danielson_2018" /&gt; Food vouchers such as Calfresh had success in reducing, “food insecurity among low-income households” during the recent recession.&lt;ref name = "Danielson_2018" /&gt; However despite the efforts made by these comprehensive assistance networks the United States has failed to make little to no advancement towards reducing food insecurity to 6% , relative to 1995 when measurements of food inequity within households began.&lt;ref name="Chilton M 2007"/&gt;
With prevalent ideas/facts like these as well as the fear of fraudulent cases the federal government has proposed a new way to alleviate food insecurity and provide what it deems as healthier choices in the Food Harvest Program.&lt;ref name = "Rosenbaum_2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosenbaum |first1=Dottie |last2=Dean |first2=Stacy |last3=Bolen |first3=Ed |last4=Cai |first4=Lexin | name-list-format = vanc |title=President's Budget Would Cut Food Assistance for Millions and Radically Restructure SNAP |url=https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/presidents-budget-would-cut-food-assistance-for-millions-and-radically |website=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities |publisher=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities | date = February 2018 |access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harvest program would cut the budget for SNAP by 30% over the next ten years by using a food delivery service to provide a box of non-perishable “surplus” goods to the recipients including a set box with canned fruits, vegetables, meats, peanut butter, and canned or frozen meat, and shelf stable milk, each box will be sized to the family size and granted benefits.&lt;ref name = "Rosenbaum_2018" /&gt; However other sources note that those with more than $90 a month in benefits, additional to the box  will have any remaining balance put on to their EBT cards.&lt;ref name = "Kirby_2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kirby |first1=Jen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Trump wants to replace food stamps with food boxes, for some reason |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/2/13/17004636/snap-trump-budget-food-stamps-food-boxes |access-date=6 June 2018 |work=Vox |agency=Vox Media, Inc. |date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of what the impact on food insecurity is unknown however there is a lack of choice in terms of what food the participants can have. Even though many still purchase foods that are deemed unhealthy much of this is due to the fact that some may live in substandard housing or not have a functional kitchen so these foods, although some may be healthy  will not always be suitable for all recipients.&lt;ref name = "Kirby_2018" /&gt; In comparison to SNAP, the administration's new program would only cover 90,000 people, while the former helped millions to come out of poverty.&lt;ref name = "Kirby_2018" /&gt; There are still many questions left to answer, like delivery and how recipients will receive their boxes, as the use of delivery may pose a risk for delays.&lt;ref name = "Rosenbaum_2018" /&gt;

Beyond money there are children and summer food programs enacted in various states including California that allows either free or reduced lunches for those in food deserts and underprivileged neighborhoods. These initiatives allow these individuals to have food security in having necessary access to food they wouldn't be able to have otherwise. Being that schools are pivotal institutions in securing food availability, the USDA has, done its part in having healthy/wholesome options available by adding new items to school lunches such as frozen rather than canned mixed berries and vegetables, grilled chicken breast fillets, egg patty rounds, and white whole wheat flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=USDA |title=SDA Foods from Farm to Plate: Spotlight on Schools |website=USDA |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |access-date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education ====

Many argue that simply increasing availability and providing vouchers will not solve the food justice issue in regards to food deserts, which is where the argument for nutrition education comes in. Studies have been shown that eating habits don't change when put grocery stores in poor neighborhoods as reiterated by Barry Popkin, a professor of Nutrition at the University of North Carolina stated that simply adding a grocery store in poor neighborhoods, will not make a huge impact as food prices and people’s shopping and eating habits undermine convenience.&lt;ref name = "Sanger-Katz_2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanger-Katz |first1=Margot |title=Giving the Poor Easy Access to Healthy Food Doesn’t Mean They’ll Buy It |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/upshot/giving-the-poor-easy-access-to-healthy-food-doesnt-mean-theyll-buy-it.html |access-date=13 May 2018 |work=The New York Times |agency=The New York Times Company |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== GMO’s ====

Many solutions target how to improve conditions in urban areas or rural areas however the food injustice and food sovereignty issue is a global one that also deals with resource availability and scarcity. Food Scarcity is and has been a motivating force behind companies such as Monsanto who campaigned on feeding the world by using genetic engineering of plants. Such plants that Monsanto and other companies create include, Herbicide-tolerant soybeans, herbicide-tolerant corn, and Bt or insect repellent corn.&lt;ref name = "Gurian-Sherman_2009"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gurian-Sherman |first1=Doug |title=Failure to Yield: Evaluating the Performance of Genetically Engineered Crops |url=https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/failure-to-yield.pdf |website=Union of Concerned Scientists |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists | date = April 2009 |access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, according to recent reports in comparison to conventional methods, GMO's and herbicide tolerant plants have failed to increase intrinsic or operational yields.&lt;ref name = "Gurian-Sherman_2009" /&gt; 
The report does acknowledge the possibility of genetic engineering eventually contributing to increase crop yields, however, the Union of Concerned Scientists note that when using farming practices that use minimal pesticides and synthetic fertilizers such as organic farming, "can more than double crop yields at little cost to poor farmers in such developing regions as Sub-Saharan Africa.”&lt;ref name = "Gurian-Sherman_2009" /&gt; 
According to a study, within the first year government-subsidized supermarkets in high need neighborhoods households were reported to have a significance effect on food availability and consumption habits.&lt;ref name = "Morgan_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morgan |first1=Elbel |last2=Moran |first2=Dixon | name-list-format = vanc | title =  Assessment of a government-subsidized supermarket in a high-need area on household food availability and children's dietary intakes |journal=Public Health Nutr |date=26 February 2015 |volume=18 |issue=15 |pages=2881–2890 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/assessment-of-a-governmentsubsidized-supermarket-in-a-highneed-area-on-household-food-availability-and-childrens-dietary-intakes/C998CF42FACEDADAE59D906CE63D04B7 |access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasoning behind this includes that individuals formed reliance on their usual supermarkets and the abundance and affordability of processed foods.&lt;ref name = "Morgan_2015" /&gt; 
Due to these reasons, overall lower income families bought less healthy food than wealthier families, however there were even greater disparities found, “between families with and without a college education.”&lt;ref name = "Sanger-Katz_2018"/&gt; These results suggest that in order to improve a person's diet 
and change perceptions it is essential that their be education on diet and health on top of increasing food accessibility and affordability.&lt;ref name = "Sanger-Katz_2018"/&gt;
However the affordability of food may in fact influence food choice if the government chose to not only subsidize fruits and vegetables but also tax fast food, "to improve weight outcomes among children and adolescents.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Determining the Extent of Food Deserts | journal = The Public Health Affects of Food Deserts: A Workshop Summary | pages = 14 | date = 2009 | pmid = 25032337 | doi = 10.17226/12623 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/12623/chapter/4#14 | isbn = 978-0-309-13728-7 | last1 = Council | first1 = National Research | last2 = Medicine | first2 = Institute of | last3 = Practice | first3 = Board on Population Health Public Health | last4 = Resources | first4 = Board on Agriculture Natural | last5 = Board | first5 = Food Nutrition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boswellia-sacra-greenhouse.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Boswellia sacra]]'' tree, from which frankincense is derived, growing inside [[Biosphere 2]]]]

'''Frankincense''' (also known as '''olibanum''', {{lang-he|לבונה}} {{IPA-he|levona|}}, [[Arabic]]: {{transl|ar|al-lubān}}) is an [[Aroma compound|aromatic]] [[resin]] used in [[incense]] and [[perfume]]s, obtained from trees of the genus ''[[Boswellia]]'' in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Burseraceae]], particularly ''[[Boswellia sacra]]'' ([[synonym (taxonomy)|syn:]] ''B. bhaw-dajiana''), B. carterii&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Boswellia frereana|B. frereana]]'', ''[[Boswellia serrata|B. serrata]]'' (''B. thurifera'', Indian frankincense), and ''[[Boswellia papyrifera|B. papyrifera]]''. The word is from [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|franc encens}} ("high-quality incense").&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five main [[species]] of ''Boswellia'' that produce true frankincense. Resin from each of the four is available in various grades, which depend on the time of [[harvest]]ing. The resin is then hand-sorted for quality.

==Etymology==
The English word ''frankincense'' is derived from the [[Old French]] expression {{lang|fro|franc encens}}, meaning "high-quality incense". The word {{wikt-lang|fro|franc}} in Old French meant "noble" or "pure".&lt;ref name="Etymonline: Frankincense"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=frankincense | title=Frankincense | website=Etymology Online | accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A popular [[folk etymology]] suggests a connection with the [[Franks]] (the forefathers of some [[France|French]] and [[Germany|Germans]]), who reintroduced the spice to Western Europe during the Middle Ages, but the word itself comes from the expression.&lt;ref name="Etymonline: Frankincense"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=frank | title=Frank | website=Etymology Online | accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Boswellia sacra.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Flowers and branches of the ''[[Boswellia sacra]]'' tree, the species from which most frankincense is derived]]
Frankincense is tapped from the scraggy but hardy trees by slashing the bark, which is called striping, and allowing the exuded resin to bleed out and harden. These hardened resins are called tears.
There are several species and varieties of frankincense trees, each producing a slightly different type of resin. Differences in soil and climate create even more diversity of the resin, even within the same species. ''[[Boswellia sacra]]'' trees are considered unusual for their ability to grow in environments so unforgiving that they sometimes grow out of  solid rock. The initial means of attachment to the rock is unknown, but is accomplished by a bulbous disk-like swelling of the trunk. This growth prevents it from being ripped from the rock during violent storms. This feature is slight or absent in trees grown in rocky soil or gravel. The trees start producing resin when they are about eight to 10 years old.&lt;ref name="oman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omanwhs.gov.om/english/Frank/FrankincenseTree.asp|title=Omani World Heritage Sites|publisher=www.omanwhs.gov.om|accessdate=2009-01-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012183204/http://omanwhs.gov.om/English/Frank/FrankincenseTree.asp|archivedate=2008-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tapping is done two to three times a year with the final taps producing the best tears due to their higher aromatic [[terpene]], [[sesquiterpene]] and [[diterpene]] content. Generally speaking, the more opaque resins are the best quality. Fine resin is produced in [[Somalia]], from which the [[Roman Catholic Church]] purchases most of its stock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8505251.stm BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have indicated that frankincense tree populations are declining, partly due to [[over-exploitation]].&lt;ref name="AP-20161225"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patinkin|first1=Jason|title=World's last wild frankincense forests are under threat|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worlds-last-wild-frankincense-forests-084122152.html|accessdate=25 December 2016|work=Yahoo Finance|agency=Associated Press|date=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily tapped trees produce seeds that germinate at only 16% while seeds of trees that had not been tapped germinate at more than 80%. In addition, burning, grazing, and attacks by the [[longhorn beetle]] have reduced the tree population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Melina |first=Remy |title=Christmas Staple Frankincense 'Doomed,' Ecologists Warn |date=December 21, 2011 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/12/21/christmas-staple-frankincense-doomed-ecologists-warn/ |publisher=LiveScience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion (clearing) of frankincense woodlands to agriculture is also a major threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dejenea |first=T.|last2=Lemenih |first2=M. |last3=Bongers |first3=F. |title=Manage or convert Boswellia woodlands?

Frankincense has been traded on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]  for more than 6,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=975255932&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=975255932.pdf Paper on Chemical Composition of Frankincense] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209115100/http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=975255932&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=975255932.pdf |date=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankincense was one of the consecrated [[incenses]] ({{transl|he|ha-ketoret}}) described in the [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]] used in [[Incense offering in rabbinic literature|''ketoret'']] ceremonies, an important component of the services in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="Klein, Ernest p.292"&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A Comprehensive [[Etymology|Etymological]] Dictionary of the [[Hebrew Language]] for Readers of English'', The [[University of Haifa]], Carta, Jerusalem, p.292&lt;/ref&gt; It was offered on a specialized incense altar in the time when the [[Tabernacle]] was located in the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple period|Second]] Temples. It is mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]] 30:34, where it is named {{wikt-lang|he|לבונה}} ({{transl|he|levona}}; [[Biblical Hebrew]]: {{transl|he|lebonah}}), similar to {{lang-he|לבן|lavan|white|label=none}}.&lt;ref name="Klein, Ernest p.292"/&gt; It was one of the ingredients in the perfume of the sanctuary ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=exodus_30:34 Exodus 30:34]), and was used as an accompaniment of the meal-offering ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=leviticus_2:1 Leviticus 2:1], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=leviticus_2:16 2:16], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=leviticus_6:15 6:15],  [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=leviticus_24:7 24:7]). It was also mentioned as a commodity in trade from [[Sheba]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=isaiah+60:6 Isaiah 60:6] ; [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=Jeremiah+6:20 Jeremiah 6:20]). When burnt it emitted a fragrant odor, and the incense was a symbol of the Divine name ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=malachi_1:11 Malachi 1:11] ; [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=songofsolomon_1:3 Song of Solomon 1:3]) and an emblem of prayer ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=psalm_141:2 Psalm 141:2]). It was often associated with [[myrrh]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=songofsolomon_3:6 Song of Solomon 3:6], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=songofsolomon_4:6 4:6]). A specially "pure" kind, lebhonah zakkah, was presented with the showbread ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=leviticus_24:7 Leviticus 24:7]).&lt;ref name="bibler.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibler.org/glossary/frankincense.html |title=www.Bibler.org - Dictionary - Frankincense |date=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Frankincense also received numerous mentions in the [[New Testament]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=luke_1:10 Luke 1:10] ; [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=revelation_5:8 Revelation 5:8], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=revelation_8:3 8:3]). Together with [[gold]] and [[myrrh]], it was made an offering to the infant Jesus ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&amp;search=matthew_2:11 Matthew 2:11]).

Frankincense was reintroduced to [[Europe]] by [[Franks#Crusaders and other Western Europeans as "Franks"|Frankish]] [[Crusaders]], although its name refers to its quality, not to the Franks themselves.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt; Although it is better known as "frankincense" to westerners, the resin is also known as ''olibanum'', or in Arabic {{transl|ar|al-lubān}} ({{wikt-lang|ar|لبان}}, roughly translated: "that which results from milking"), a reference to the milky sap tapped from the ''Boswellia'' tree.

The [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] was familiar with frankincense and knew it was harvested from trees in southern Arabia. He reported that the gum was dangerous to harvest because of venomous snakes that lived in the trees. He goes on to describe the method used by the Arabs to get around this problem, that being the burning of the gum of the [[styrax]] tree whose smoke would drive the snakes away.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 3,107&lt;/ref&gt; The [[resin]] is also mentioned by [[Theophrastus]] and by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''.

Southern Arabia was a major exporter of frankincense in antiquity, with some of it being traded as far as [[China]]. The 13th-century Chinese writer and customs inspector [[Zhao Rugua]] wrote on the origin of frankincense, and of its being traded to China:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Ruxiang'' or ''xunluxiang'' comes from the three Dashi [Arab] countries of [[Murbat]] (Maloba), [[Shihr]] (Shihe), and [[Dhofar]] (Nufa), from the depths of the remotest mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kauz |first=Ralph |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJibpHfnw94C&amp;pg=PA130 |accessdate=December 26, 2011 |title=Aspects of the Maritime Silk Road: From the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea |year=2010 |volume=Volume 10 of East Asian Economic and Socio-cultural Studies - East Asian Maritime History |editor=Ralph Kauz |edition= |location= |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |page=130 |isbn=978-3-447-06103-2 |quote=The frankincense was first collected in the [[Hadhramaut]] ports of Mirbat, Shihr, and Zufar whence Arab merchant vessels shipped it to Srivijaya, before it was then reexported to China.

==Quality==

[[File:Olebanum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frankincense]]
[[File:Dabqaad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Frankincense is often prepared inside a [[censer]], such as the [[Sepiolite|meerschaum]] ''[[dabqaad]]'' traditionally used in [[Somalia]] and [[Djibouti]].]]
[[File:FrankinsenceEssOil.png|thumb|right|200px|Frankincense (''Boswellia carteri'') [[essential oil]]]]

Frankincense comes in many types, and its quality is based on color, purity, aroma, age, and shape.  ''Silver'' and ''Hojari'' are generally considered the highest grades of frankincense.

Currently{{when|date=July 2018}}, there are two [[dissertations]] which may enable the identification of a few olibanum species according to their specific secondary metabolism products{{vague|date=July 2018}}.&lt;ref name=chemotax&gt;Chemotaxonomic Investigations on Resins of the Frankincense Species Boswellia papyrifera, Boswellia serrata and Boswellia sacra, respectively, Boswellia carterii: A Qualitative and Quantitative Approach by Chromatographic and Spectroscopic Methodology, Paul, M., Dissertation, Saarland University (2012) http://scidok.sulb.uni-saarland.de/volltexte/2012/4999/pdf/Dissertation_Fertig_211112.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=phytochem&gt;Phytochemical Investigations on Boswellia Species, Basar, S., Dissertation, Hamburg University (2005) http://www.chemie.uni-hamburg.de/bibliothek/2005/DissertationBasar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

Estimates of the current{{when|date=July 2018}} annual world production of frankincense vary, but generally are around several thousands tonnes. More than 82% of the product comes from [[Somalia]], with some frankincense also gathered in adjacent [[Southern Arabia]] and [[Ethiopia]], [[Sudan]], and other central African countries{{Citation needed|reason=Where does this data come from?|date=July 2018}}.

In Somalia, frankincense is harvested in the [[Sanaag]] and [[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] regions: mountains lying at the northwest of [[Erigavo]]; [[El Afweyn District]]; [[Cal Madow]] mountain range, a westerly escarpment that runs parallel to the coast; Cal Miskeed, a middle segment of the frankincense-growing escarpment; [[Karkaar]] mountains or eastern escarpment, which lies at the eastern fringe of the frankinscence escarpment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = War-Torn Societies Project International, Somali Programme|title=Rebuilding Somalia: Issues and possibilities for Puntland |date=2001 |publisher=HAAN |location=London |isbn=978-1874209041 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20161225" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In [[Dhofar]], [[Oman]], frankincense species grow north of [[Salalah]] and were traded in the ancient coastal city of Sumhuram, now [[Khor Rori]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coppi|first=Andrea|last2=Cecchi|first2=Lorenzo|last3=Selvi|first3=Federico|last4=Raffaelli|first4=Mauro|date=2010-03-18|title=The Frankincense tree (Boswellia sacra, Burseraceae) from Oman: ITS and ISSR analyses of genetic diversity and implications for conservation|journal=Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution|language=en|volume=57|issue=7|pages=1041–1052|doi=10.1007/s10722-010-9546-8|issn=0925-9864}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Uses==

Frankincense is used in [[perfumery]] and [[aromatherapy]]. It is also an ingredient that is sometimes used in [[skincare]]. The [[essential oil]] is obtained by [[steam distillation]] of the dry resin. Some of the [[odor|smells]] of the frankincense [[smoke]] are products of [[pyrolysis]].{{Citation needed|reason=Says who?|date=July 2018}}

In [[Chinese medicine]], it (''ru xiang'') along with [[myrrh]] (''mo yao'') have anti-bacterial properties as well as blood-moving uses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} It can be used [[topically]] or orally. The Egyptians cleansed body cavities in the [[mummification]] process with frankincense and [[natron]]. In [[Persian medicine]], it is used for diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effects of Boswellia serrata Gum Resin on the Blood Glucose and Lipid Profile of Diabetic Patients: A Double-Blind Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.|journal=Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine|volume=23|pages=2515690X18772728|doi=10.1177/2515690X18772728|pmid=29774768|pmc=5960856|year=2018|last1=Mehrzadi|first1=S.|last2=Tavakolifar|first2=B.|last3=Huseini|first3=H. F.|last4=Mosavat|first4=S. H.|last5=Heydari|first5=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankincense is used in many [[Christian]] churches, including the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] churches. According to the Biblical text of [[Matthew 2:11]], [[gold]], frankincense, and [[myrrh]] were among the gifts to [[Jesus]] by the [[biblical magi]] "from out of the East." Christian and Islamic [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic faiths]] have all used frankincense mixed with oils to anoint newborn infants, initiates and members entering into new phases of their spiritual lives.

The spread of [[Christianity]] depressed the market for frankincense during the 4th century AD. [[Desertification]] made the [[camel train|caravan]] routes across the [[Rub' al-Khali]] ("Empty Quarter") of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] more difficult.{{Cn|date=November 2018}} 

===Essential oil===

The [[essential oil]] of frankincense is produced by [[steam distillation]] of the tree resin. The oil's chemical components are 75% [[monoterpene]]s, [[sesquiterpene]]s, monoterpenoles, sesquiterpenols and [[ketone]]s.{{Original research inline|date=July 2018}} It has a good [[balsamic]] sweet fragrance, while the Indian frankincense oil has a very fresh smell.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Contrary to what some commercial entities claim, steam or hydro distilled frankincense oils do not contain boswellic acids (triterpenoids), although may be present in trace quantities in the solvent extracted products.{{Original research inline|date=July 2018}} The chemistry of the essential oil is mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, such as alpha-pinene, Limonene, alpha-Thujene, and beta-Pinene with small amounts of [[terpenoid|diterpenoid]] components being the upper limit in terms of molecular weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verghese |first1=J. |year=1987 |title=A Fresh Look at the Constituents of Indian Olibanum Oil |url= |journal=Flav.

===Perfume===
Olibanum is characterised by a balsamic-spicy, slightly lemon, fragrance of incense, with a conifer-like undertone. It is used in the [[perfume]], [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] and [[pharmaceutical]] industries.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[File:177 White-crowned Pigeon crop.jpg|thumb|right| Franklin's Forest is an important site for white-crowned pigeons]]

'''Franklin's Forest''' lies near the centre of the East End distinct of [[Grand Cayman]], one of the [[Cayman Islands]], a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It is one of the territory’s [[Important Bird Area]]s (IBAs).

==Description==
Franklin's Forest is a 111&amp;nbsp;ha tract of native [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forest]] bordered by ''[[Conocarpus]]'' [[wetland]]s and farmland. It lies south of the Salina Reserve and east of [[Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park]]. It is unprotected and partly privately owned.&lt;ref name=bli/&gt;

===Birds===
The IBA was identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because it supports populations of [[white-crowned pigeon]]s, [[Cuban amazon]]s, [[Caribbean elaenia]]s, [[thick-billed vireo]]s, [[Yucatan vireo]]s and [[vitelline warbler]]s.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org |title=Franklin's Forest |accessdate=2014-04-02 |work=Important Bird Areas factsheet |first= |last= |publisher=BirdLife International |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QE8rvIqH?url=http://www.birdlife.org/ |archivedate=2007-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Drifter Program''' (GDP) (formerly known as the Surface Velocity Program (SVP)), was conceived by Prof. [[Pearn P. Niiler|Peter Niiler]], with the objective of collecting measurements of surface [[ocean currents]], sea surface temperature and sea-level atmospheric pressure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Centurioni|first=Luca|display-authors=etal|year=2016|title=A Global Ocean Observing System for Measuring Sea Level Atmospheric Pressure: Effects and Impacts on Numerical Weather Prediction|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00080.1|journal=Bull.

It is the principal component of the Global Surface Drifting Buoy Array, a branch of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA's]] Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/goos.php Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS)]&lt;/ref&gt; and a scientific project of the Data Buoy Cooperation Panel (DBCP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcommops.org/dbcp/ Data Buoy Cooperation Panel (DBCP)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "noaa"&gt;http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/gdp_objectives.php&lt;/ref&gt; The project originated in February 1979 as part of the TOGA/Equatorial Pacific Ocean Circulation Experiment (EPOCS) and the first large-scale deployment of [[Drifter (floating device)|drifter]]s was in 1988 with the goal of mapping the tropical [[Pacific Ocean]]'s surface circulation.&lt;ref name = svp /&gt; The current goal of the project is to use 1250 satellite-tracked surface drifting buoys to make accurate and globally dense in-situ observations of mixed layer currents, [[sea surface temperature]], [[atmospheric pressure]], [[wind]]s and [[salinity]], and to create a system to process the data.&lt;ref name = "noaa" /&gt; Horizontal transports in the oceanic mixed layer measured by the GDP are relevant to [[Biology|biological]] and chemical processes as well as physical ones.&lt;ref name = carton&gt;Grodsky, Semyon A., Rick Lumpkin, and James A.

==Drifters==
[[File:Drifterpic1.jpg|thumb|This is a picture of the drifters used in the GDP (photo by GDP).]]  
SVP project drifter deployments began in 1979; the design continued to develop until reaching its current form in 1992.&lt;ref name = svp&gt;Lumpkin, R. and M.

Chapter two of Lagrangian Analysis and Prediction of Coastal and Ocean Dynamics (LAPCOD) ed. A. Griffa, A. D. Kirwan, A. J. Mariano, T. Ozgokmen, and T. Rossby.&lt;/ref&gt; Each drifter consists of a spherical surface buoy tethered to a weighted nylon drogue that allows it to track the horizontal motion of water at a depth of 15 meters.&lt;ref name = carton /&gt; If the drogue breaks off, the wind pushes the surface buoy through the water, creating erroneous current observations.&lt;ref name = carton /&gt;  A tether strain gauge has been added to monitor tension of the buoy-drogue connection to resolve this issue.&lt;ref name = carton /&gt; The original drifters are heavy, bulky (40&amp;nbsp;cm diameter), and expensive relative to the newer "mini" drifters that are smaller, (30.5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter) cheaper, and lighter because the hull contains fewer batteries.&lt;ref name = svp/&gt;  The surface float contains alkaline batteries, a satellite transmitter, a thermistor for sub-skin sea surface temperature, and sometimes other instruments that measure pressure, wind speed and direction, or salinity.&lt;ref name = svp/&gt;  [[File:SVP-B.jpg|thumb|SVP buoy fitted with a barometer (photo by DBi).]]

The drifters are deployed from research vessels, volunteer ships, and through air deployment.&lt;ref name = svp/&gt;  They typically transmit their data hourly and had an average lifetime of ~485 days in 2001.&lt;ref name = svp/&gt;  Presently, enough data is gathered to observe currents at a horizontal resolution of one degree (~100&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name = svp/&gt;  Single drifters can be [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/gdp_track.php tracked] with the name of the drifter.

==Applications==
The data from the GDP have been used by [[Oceanography|oceanographers]] to derive maps of lateral diffusivity and Lagrangian length- and time-scales across the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Zhurbas, Victor, and Im Sang Oh. "Lateral diffusivity and Lagrangian scales in the Pacific Ocean as derived from drifter data." Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans (1978–2012) 108.C5 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other uses include studies of plastic accumulation the ocean,&lt;ref&gt;Law, Kara Lavender, et al. "Plastic accumulation in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre."

==Organization and Collaborators==
The GDP consists of three components.&lt;ref name = noaa /&gt;  The component at NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ (AOML)] manages deployments, processes and archives the data, maintains META files describing each drifter deployed, develops and distributes data-based products, and updates the [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/index.php GDP website].&lt;ref name="noaa" /&gt;  The Lagrangian Drifter Laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gdp.ucsd.edu/ldl_drifter/index.html|title=Lagrangian Drifter Lab|last=|first=|date=|website=gdp.ucsd.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) leads the engineering aspects of the Lagrangian drifter technology, improves the existing designs, develops new drifters, manages the real-time data stream, including posting the drifter data to the [[Global Telecommunications System|Global Telecommunication System]], supervises the industry, purchases and fabricates most drifters, and develops enhanced data sets.  The third component is the manufacturers in private industry, who build drifters according to specifications.  The GDP collaborates with partners from numerous countries including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, India, Italy, Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name = noaa /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35776">The '''Great Lakes tectonic zone''' (GLTZ) is bounded by [[South Dakota]] at its tip and heads northeast to south of [[Duluth, Minnesota]], then heads east through northern [[Wisconsin]], [[Marquette, Michigan]], and then trends more northeasterly to skim the northern-most shores of lakes Michigan and Huron before ending in the [[Sudbury, Ontario]], Canada, area.

During the Late [[Archean]] Era the [[Algoman orogeny]] added landmass to the [[Superior craton|Superior province]] by [[Volcano#Convergent plate boundaries|volcanic activity]] and [[continental collision]] along a boundary that stretches from present-day South Dakota, U.S., into the [[Lake Huron]] region near [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

It is {{convert|1400|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and separates the older [[Archaen|Archean]] gneissic terrane to the south from younger Late Archean [[Greenstone belt|greenstone]]-granite [[terrane]] to the north.

The zone is characterized by active compression during the Algoman orogeny (about {{mya|2700|million years ago}}), a pulling-apart ([[Extensional tectonics|extensional]]) tectonics (2,450 to 2,100 million years ago), a second compression during the Penokean orogeny (1,900 to 1,850 million years ago), a second extension during Middle [[Proterozoic]] time (1,600 million years ago) and minor reactivation during [[Phanerozoic]] time (the past 500 million years).

Collision began along the Great Lakes tectonic zone with the Algoman mountain-building event and continued for tens of millions of years. During the formation of the GLTZ, the gneissic [[Minnesota River Valley subprovince]] was thrust up onto the Superior province's edge as it consumed the Superior province's oceanic crust. Fragmentation of the [[Kenorland]] supercontinent began {{mya|2450|million years ago}} and was completed by {{mya|2100|million years ago}}. The [[Wyoming craton|Wyoming province]] is the continental landmass that is hypothesized to have rifted away from the southern Superior province portion of Kenorland, before moving rapidly west and docking with the [[Laurentia]] supercontinent 1,850 to 1,715 million years ago. [[Sedimentation#Geology|Sedimentation]] from the GLTZ-rifting environment continued into the Penokean orogeny, which is the next major [[Tectonics|tectonic]] event in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]]. Several [[earthquakes]] have been documented in Minnesota, Michigan's Upper Peninsula and Sudbury in the last 120 years along the GLTZ.

During the Late Archean Eon the Algoman orogeny – which occurred about {{mya|2750|million years ago}} – added landmass through volcanic activity and continental collision along a boundary that stretches from present-day South Dakota, U.S., into the Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, region.

==Mechanism==

===Collision===

[[Image:Orogenic wedge.jpg|thumb|350px|right|alt=This diagram shows the dynamics of two colliding continental plates.|This diagram shows the dynamics of two colliding continental plates. The Superior province was underridden by the Minnesota River Valley subprovince plate.]]

The collision of the gneissic Minnesota River Valley (MRV) subprovince onto the southern edge of the Superior province was another process in the slow change in tectonics&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; which marks the end of the Archean Eon. This gneissic terrane originally extended several hundred kilometers east to west, making it more of a [[protocontinent]] than a future Superior province belt.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; The boundary that separates the two colliding bodies is the Great Lakes tectonic zone; it is a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] zone of highly deformed rocks.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Collision began along the GLTZ around {{mya|2700|million years ago}} and continued for tens of millions of years.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; The collision is interpreted to have happened obliquely at an angle,&lt;ref name=basement/&gt; beginning in the west.

===Suturing===

The MRV subprovince experienced two distinct high-grade [[Metamorphism|metamorphic]] events, one {{mya|3050|million years ago}} and the other {{mya|2600|million years ago}}.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; The first was probably during formation of the terrane, the second was during suturing.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; The growth of the Superior province greenstone-granitic terranes ended with the suturing of the Minnesota River Valley gneiss terrane to the [[basalt]]ic Wawa subprovince.&lt;ref name=tohver&gt;{{cite report|title=Late Paleoproterozoic (geon 18 and 17) reactivation of the Neoarchean Great Lakes Tectonic Zone, northern Michigan, USA: Evidence from kinematic analysis, thermobarometry and &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar/&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar geochronology|author1=Tohver, E.|author2=Holm, D.K.|author3=van der Pluijm, B.A.|author4=Essene, E.J.|author5=Cambray, F.W.|date=received March 24, 2006, accepted February 5, 2007|doi=10.1016/j.precamres/2007.02.014|url=http://globalchange.umich.edu/Ben/Publications/07_precam_tohver.pdf|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}} Suturing, the last stage of closure, started in South Dakota and continued eastward.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt;

During the formation of the GLTZ, the MRV protocontinent consumed the Superior province's [[Oceanic crust#Life cycle|oceanic crust]] as the subprovince came in from the south.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Suturing of one continental block onto another usually occurs because a [[subduction]] zone exists beneath one of the blocks.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; The subduction zone consumes the oceanic crust connected to the other block.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; After the oceanic crust is consumed, the two blocks meet and the subducting oceanic crust pulls the attached continental block under the other.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; During the collision with the Superior province, the MRV gneissic block was thrust up onto the Superior province's edge; this resulted in a thrusted crumpled fault tens of kilometers wide producing a mountain range, and a [[Shear (geology)#Shear zone|shear zone]] which defines the boundary between the two terranes.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Tectonism along the zone began during the docking of the two terranes into a single continental mass, and culminated in the early Proterozoic, where deformation took place under low to intermediate pressures.&lt;ref name=morey&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Great Lakes tectonic zone — A major crustal structure in central North America|author1=Sims, P.K.|author2=Card, K.D.|author3=Morey, G.B.|author4=Peterman, Z.E.|journal=GSA Bulletin|date=December 1980|volume=91|number=12|page=690|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1980)91&lt;690:TGLTZA&gt;2.0.CO;2|publisher=© 1980 Geological Society of America|url=http://bulletin.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/12/690|accessdate=March 29, 2010|bibcode = 1980GSAB...91..690S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rifting===

[[Image:Divergent border lmb.png|thumb|left|alt=This diagrams shows a hotspot under diverging continental plates.|Hotspot causing rifting of tectonic plates]]

===Cessation of rifting===

The pattern of sedimentation from this rifting environment continued into the Penokean orogeny, which is the next major tectonic event in the Great Lakes region.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; During the Penokean orogeny (1,850 to 1,900 million years ago), [[Compression (geology)|compression]] deformed the sequences in the Lake Superior region.&lt;ref name=morey/&gt;

Compressive deformation during the Penokean orogeny reactivated the GLTZ, which followed deposition of the Marquette Range Supergroup sediments&lt;ref name=domes/&gt;{{rp|322}} and resulted in a north-side up motion along steep brittle-ductile faults in the eastern, low-grade portion of the Marquette [[trough (geology)|Trough]]&lt;ref name=tohver/&gt;{{rp|165}} In the western portion of the Marquette [[syncline]], a second episode of GLTZ reactivation took place during the uplift of the post-Huronian 2,400- to 2,100-million-year-old granitic Southern Complex.&lt;ref name=tohver/&gt;{{rp|165}}

==Wyoming province separation hypothesis==

===General information===

An episode of hotspot gabbro magmatism occurred {{mya|2480|million years ago}} at the eastern edge of the Wyoming [[craton]],&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|1}} south of current-day Sudbury. Continental rifting is exhibited by emplacement of [[mafic]] igneous rocks on each side of the rift margins.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|9}} By {{mya|2100|million years ago}} the Superior and Wyoming provinces had completely separated.&lt;ref name=tohver/&gt;{{rp|145}} From about 2,100 to 1,865 million years ago the Wyoming craton drifted in a westward direction until it docked {{mya|1865|million years ago}} with the Superior province,&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|10}} northwest of its original position.

====Before rifting====

The final assembly of supercontinent Kenorland was finished by 2,600 to 2,550 million years ago; the southern Superior province – with the Minnesota River Valley subprovince attached – and the current-day southeastern border of the Wyoming province abutted each other from the Sudbury area westerly about {{convert|625|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} to the Wisconsin-Michigan state line on Lake Superior.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|8}}{{refn|group="note"|The distance measurements in the Wyoming province section are derived by the original author of this article with the use of three resources: '''1.'''Geological Guidebook to the Paleoproterozoic East Bull Lake Intrusive

The Blue Draw Metagabbros – in the Black Hills of South Dakota – were {{convert|625|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} west of Sudbury and {{convert|150|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south of the western-most contact of the two provinces on the Wyoming province.

====During rifting====

Note the Blue Draw Metagabbro (BDM), marked by the red dot, on the Wyoming province.]]

The 2,170-million-year-old intrusive events that affected the Superior and the Wyoming cratons indicate that the plume had moved {{convert|330|km|mi|abbr=on}} west, centered in the opening between the Superior province and the rifting Wyoming province.&lt;ref name=dahl&gt;{{cite journal|title=2480 Ma mafic magmatism in the northern Black Hills, South Dakota: a new link connecting the Wyoming and Superior cratons|author1=Dahl, Peter S.|author2=Hamilton, Michael A.|author3=Wooden, Joseph L.|author4=Foland, Kenneth A.|author5=Frei, Robert|author6=McCombs, James A.|author7=Hom, Daniel K.|journal=Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=43|issue=10|year=2006|pages=1579–1600|url=http://www.largeigneousprovinces.org/07feb.html|accessdate=April 2, 2010|bibcode = 2006CaJES..43.1579D |doi = 10.1139/E06-066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} The Wyoming province was rotating away, with the Blue Draw Metagabbro being the pivot point. Harlan's reconstruction of this pivot is shown to the right. At this time the two provinces are in contact at only one point north of the Blue Draw Metagabbro; that point of contact was {{convert|875|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} from Sudbury and {{convert|95|km|mi|-1||abbr=on}} southwest of Duluth, Minnesota. The Blue Draw Metagabbro is now {{convert|935|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} west of Sudbury and remains about {{convert|150|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south of the Superior-Wyoming provinces' junction.

====After complete separation====

The 2,125- to 2,090-million-year-old mafic magmatic events affecting the Superior and Wyoming cratons show the hotspot having moved {{convert|500|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} west from Sudbury, and the two provinces have rifted so that they are separated by {{convert|100|km|mi|-1||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|8}} That narrowest distance between the two cratons is {{convert|1150|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Sudbury, in east-central South Dakota. The Blue Draw Metagabbro is now {{convert|950|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Sudbury and {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Superior province's southern border.

===Supporting evidence===

====Before rifting====
[[File:Matachewan and Mistassini dike swarms.png|thumb|left|alt=This map shows the location of the Matachewan Dike Swarms, which are northeast of Lake Superior and southwest of James Bay.|Matachewan Dike Swarms]]

Swarms of mafic dikes and sills are typical of continental rifting and can be used to time supercontinent breakup.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|2}} Intrusion of the 2,475- to 2,445-million-year-old Matachewan-Hearst Mafic Dike Swarm and the 2,490- to 2,475-million-year-old East Bull Lake suite of layered mafic intrusive rocks are interpreted as indicating early Paleoproterozoic, mantle-hotspot driven rifting centered near Sudbury, Ontario, during the onset of Kenorland breakup.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|2}} Radiometric dating shows that the Wyoming province's Blue Draw Metagabbro was undergoing rifting at {{mya|2480|million years ago}}, the same time the emplacement of the {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} long belt of mafic layered intrusions in the Sudbury region.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|9}}

In the northern Black Hills of southwest South Dakota the 2,600- to 2,560-million-year-old Precambrian cystalline core, the Blue Draw Metagabbro, is a {{convert|1|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} thick layered sill.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|1}} The East Bull Lake intrusive suite, in the southern Superior province near Sudbury, Ontario, aligns spatially with the Blue Draw Metagabbro if the Superior and Wyoming cratons are restored to the Kenorland configuration proposed by Roscoe and Card (1993).&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|2}} These layered mafic intrusions are of similar thickness and identical age, and occur along a rifted belt.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|1}}
 
Recent paleomagnetic and geochronological data from the central Wyoming craton support the hypothesis that the [[Huronian Supergroup|Huronian]] (in southern Ontario) and Snowy Pass (in southeastern Wyoming) [[Geological unit#Lithostratigraphic units|supergroups]] were adjacent to each other at {{mya|2170|million years ago}} and may have evolved as a single sedimentary rift basin between 2,450 and 2,100 million years ago.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|2}} These Huronian and Snowy Pass sedimentary rocks are similar, each having 2,450- to 2,100-million-year-old epicratonic rifts succeeded by a 2,100- to 1,800-million-year-old passive sedimentary margins.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|2}}

====During rifting====

Much of the southeastern Superior province was bisected by the more than {{convert|300000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} 2,172- to 2,167-million-year-old Biscotasing Diabase Swarm which trended northeast from Sudbury.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|9}} In southcentral Wyoming province there is a 2,170 ± 8-million-year-old quartz diorite dike of [[Wind River Range#Geology|Wind River Range]].&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|9}}

====After complete separation====

By {{mya|2100|million years ago}}, the Wyoming craton is thought to have completely separated from the southern Superior province, this is consistent with the occurrence of a 2,076- to 2,067-million-year-old hotspot centered just south of the Superior province and east of the MRV.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|2}} The 2,125- to 2,101-million-year-old Marathon and 2,077- to 2,076-million-year-old Fort Frances dikes, both on the present-day Superior province north of the Great Lakes tectonic zone, are consistent with rifting during this time period.&lt;ref name=dahl/&gt;{{rp|9}}

[[File:The grave of Rev Prof Henry Drummond, Valley Cemetery, Stirling.jpg|thumb|The grave of Rev Prof Henry Drummond, Valley Cemetery, Stirling]]
Rev Prof '''Henry Drummond''' [[FRSE]] [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] [[Fellow of the Geological Society|FGS]] (17 August 1851 – 11 March 1897) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[evangelism|evangelist]], [[biology|biologist]], writer and lecturer.

Many of his writings were too nicely adapted to the needs of his own day to justify the expectation that they would long survive it, but few men exercised more religious influence in their own generation, especially on young men. His sermon "The Greatest Thing in the World" remains popular in Christian circles.

== Life and work ==
Drummond was born at Park Place in [[Stirling]], the son of William Drummond (d.1888) a seedsman (founder of Drummond Seeds), and his wife, Jane Campbell Blackwood (d.1910). His early education was at [[Stirling High School]] and [[Morrison's Academy]].&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical index of former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006 |publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh |isbn=0 902 198 84 X |url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond was educated at [[Edinburgh University]], where he displayed a strong inclination for physical and mathematical science. The religious element was an even more powerful factor in his nature, and disposed him to enter the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. While preparing for the ministry, he became for a time deeply interested in the evangelizing mission of [[Dwight Lyman Moody|Moody]] and [[Ira David Sankey|Sankey]], in which he actively co-operated for two years.

In 1877 he became lecturer on natural science in the Free Church College on Lynedoch Street in [[Glasgow]], which enabled him to combine all the pursuits for which he felt a vocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bebbington |first1=David W. |title=Henry Drummond, evangelicism and science |date=1998 |publisher=Scottish Church History Society |url=https://archive.org/details/rschsv028p1bebbington |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond was an advocate of [[theistic evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightman, Bernard. (2010). ''Darwin and the Popularization of Evolution''. ''[[Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London]]'' 64 (1): 5-24.&lt;/ref&gt; His studies resulted in his writing ''Natural Law in the Spiritual World'', the argument of which is that the scientific principle of continuity extends from the physical world to the spiritual. Before the book was published in 1883, an invitation from the [[African Lakes Company]] drew Drummond away to Central [[Africa]]. 

In 1880 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were Sir [[Archibald Geikie]], [[William Thomson, Lord Kelvin]], [[John Gray McKendrick]], and Sir [[Robert Christison]].&lt;ref name=index/&gt;

Upon his return in the following year he found himself famous. In 1884 he was a guest at [[Haddo House]] for a dinner hosted by [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]] in honour of [[William Ewart Gladstone]] on his tour of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Emslie|first=Alfred Edward |title=Dinner at Haddo House, 1884 |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw00023/Dinner-at-Haddo-House-1884 |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery, London]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large bodies of serious readers, among the religious and the scientific classes alike, discovered in ''Natural Law'' the common standing-ground which they needed; and the universality of the demand proved, if nothing more, the seasonableness of its publication. Drummond continued to be actively interested in missionary and other movements among the Free Church students.

In 1888 he published ''Tropical Africa'', a valuable digest of information.&lt;ref&gt;Review, ''Anti-Slavery Reporter,'' May–June 1888, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1890 he travelled in [[Australia]], and in 1893 delivered the Lowell Lectures at [[Boston]]. It had been his intention to reserve them for mature revision, but an attempted piracy compelled him to hasten their publication, and they appeared in 1894 under the title of ''The Ascent of Man''. Their object was to vindicate for [[altruism]], or the disinterested care and compassion of animals for each other, an important part in effecting the [[survival of the fittest]], a thesis previously maintained by [[John Fiske (philosopher)|Professor John Fiske]]. In this later stage of his life he lived at 3 Park Circus in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1895-96&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond's health failed shortly afterwards (he had suffered from bone cancer for some years), and he died on 11 March 1897 whilst travelling in [[Tunbridge Wells]]. His body was returned to [[Church of the Holy Rude|Holy Rude Cemetery]] in Stirling for burial with his parents. The grave, marked by a large distinctive red granite Celtic cross, stands just north-east of the church.

In 1905 a medallion plaque to his memory was erected in the Free Church College in Edinburgh, sculpted by [[James Pittendrigh Macgillivray]].

'''''[[In-situ]]'' conservation''' is the on-site [[Conservation movement|conservation]] or the conservation of genetic resources in natural populations of [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]], such as [[forest genetic resources]] in natural populations of Teagan species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjfVFGM4p6wC|title=Biodiversity and Its Conservation in India|last=Negi|first=Sharad Singh|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788185182889|page=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process of protecting an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]] in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], either by protecting or restoring the habitat itself, or by defending the species from [[Predation|predators]]. It is applied to conservation of [[agricultural biodiversity]] in [[agro ecosystem]]s by farmers, especially those using unconventional farming practices.


==Methods==
About 4% of the total geographical area of the country is used for ''in situ'' conservation. The following methods are presently used for ''in situ'' conservation.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! In-situ conservation !! Number available
|-
| Biosphere reserves || 18
|-
| National parks || 104
|-
| Wild-life sanctuaries || 543
|-
| Biodiversity hotspots || 4
|-
|}

===Biosphere reserve===
Biosphere reserves cover very large areas, often more than 5000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. They are used to protect species for a long time. Currently, there are 18 Biosphere Reserves in India.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! State
|-
| Nanda Devi || Uttarakhand
|-
| Nokrek || Meghalaya
|-
| Manas || Assam
|-
|Sundarban || West Bengal
|
|}

===National parks===
A national park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment. It is usually a small reserve covering an area of about 100 to 500 square kilometers. Within biosphere reserves, one or more national parks may also exist. Currently, there are 103 national parks in India.
{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| Kanha || M.P || Tiger
|-
| Periyar || Kerala || Tiger, elephant
|-
| Ranthambore National Park || Rajasthan || Tiger
|}

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
A wildlife sanctuary is an area which is reserved for the conservation of animals only. Currently, there are 543 wild sanctuaries in India.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! State !! Major wildlife
|-
| Hazaribagh sanctuary || Jharkhand || Tiger, leopard
|-
| Ghana Bird sanctuary || Rajasthan || 300 species of Birds
|-

| Nal sarovar Bird Sanctuary || Gujarat || Water birds
|-
| Mudumalai Wild life Sanctuary || Tamil Nadu || Tiger, elephant, leopard
|-
| Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary || Tamil Nadu || Water birds
|}
{| class="wikitable"

===Biodiversity Hotspots===
According to Conservation international, to qualify as a hotspot a region must meet two strict criteria :
 
• it must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (∆ 0.5% of the world's total) as endemics,

• it has to have lost at least 70% of its original habitat.

|-
|}

===Gene sanctuary===
A gene sanctuary is an area where plants are conserved.
It includes both biosphere reserves as well as national parks.
India has set up its first gene sanctuary in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya for wild relatives of citrus. Efforts are also being made to set up gene sanctuaries for banana, sugarcane, rice and mango.

===Community reserves===
It is the type of protected area introduced in Wildlife Protection Amendment Act 2002 to provide legal support to community or privately owned reserves which cannot be designated as national park or wildlife sanctuary.

===Sacred groves===
They are tracts of forest set aside where all the trees and wildlife within are venerated and given total protection.

==Benefits==
One benefit of ''in situ'' conservation is that it maintains recovering populations in the environment where they have developed their distinctive properties. Another benefit is that this strategy helps ensure the ongoing processes of evolution and adaptation within their environments. As a last resort, [[ex-situ conservation]] may be used on some or all of the population, when ''in situ'' conservation is too difficult, or impossible. The species gets adjusted to the natural disasters like drought, floods, forest fires and this method is very cheap and convenient.

==Reserves==
Wildlife and livestock conservation is mostly based on nothing. This involves the protection of wildlife habitats. Also, sufficiently large reserves are maintained to enable the target species to exist in large numbers. The population size must be sufficient to enable the necessary [[genetic diversity]] to survive within the population, so that it has a good chance of continuing to [[Adaptation (biology)|adapt]] and [[evolution|evolve]] over time. This reserve size can be calculated for target species by examining the population density in naturally occurring situations. The reserves must then be protected from intrusion or destruction by man, and against other catastrophes.

==Agriculture==
In [[agriculture]], ''in situ conservation'' techniques are an effective way to improve, maintain, and use traditional or native varieties of agricultural crops. Such methodologies link the positive output of scientific research with farmers' experience and field work.

First, the accessions of a variety stored at a [[germplasm]] bank and those of the same variety multiplied by farmers are jointly tested in the producers field and in the laboratory, under different situations and stresses. Thus, the scientific knowledge about the production characteristics of the native varieties is enhanced. Later, the best tested accessions are crossed, mixed, and multiplied under replicable situations. At last, these improved accessions are supplied to the producers. Thus, farmers are enabled to crop improved selections of their own varieties, instead of being lured to substitute their own varieties with commercial ones or to abandon their crop. This technique of conservation of agricultural biodiversity is more successful in marginal areas, where commercial varieties are not expedient, due to climate and [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]] constraints. Or where the taste and cooking characteristics of traditional varieties compensate for their lower yields.&lt;ref&gt;G. Avila, L. Guzmán, M. Céspedes 2004.

The start of the period was marked by the major [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]]. Two other [[extinction]] events occurred during the period: the [[Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction]] in the Early Jurassic, and the [[Tithonian]] event at the end&lt;ref name='Hallam 1986'&gt;{{cite journal

The Jurassic period is divided into three [[Epoch (geology)|epochs]]: Early, Middle, and Late. Similarly, in [[stratigraphy]],  the Jurassic is divided into the [[Lower Jurassic]], [[Middle Jurassic]], and [[Upper Jurassic]] [[Series (stratigraphy)|series]] of rock formations.

The Jurassic is named after the [[Jura Mountains]] within the [[European Alps]], where [[limestone]] strata from the period were first identified.
By the beginning of the Jurassic, the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] had begun [[rift]]ing into two landmasses: [[Laurasia]] to the north, and [[Gondwana]] to the south. This created more coastlines and shifted the continental climate from dry to humid, and many of the [[arid]] deserts of the Triassic were replaced by lush rainforests.

On land, the fauna transitioned from the Triassic fauna, dominated by both [[Dinosauromorpha|dinosauromorph]] and [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorph]] [[archosaur]]s, to one dominated by [[dinosaur]]s alone. The first [[bird]]s also appeared during the Jurassic, having evolved from a branch of [[theropod]] dinosaurs. Other major events include the appearance of the earliest lizards, and the evolution of [[theria]]n mammals, including primitive [[placental]]s. Crocodilians made the transition from a terrestrial to an aquatic mode of life. The oceans were inhabited by [[marine reptiles]] such as [[ichthyosaur]]s and [[plesiosaur]]s, while [[pterosaur]]s were the dominant flying [[vertebrates]].

==History of term==
The [[Chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] term "Jurassic" is directly linked to the [[Jura Mountains]], a [[mountain range]]  mainly following the course of the [[France–Switzerland border]]. During a tour of the region in 1795,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Kosmos'', volume 4 (Stuttgart: Cotta, 1858), [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5322149281;view=1up;seq=638 p. 632]: "Ich hatte mich auf einer geognostischen Reise, die ich 1795 durch das südliche Franken, die westliche Schweiz und Ober-Italien machte, davon überzeugt, daß der Jura-Kalkstein, welchen Werner zu seinem Muschelkalk rechnete, eine eigne Formation bildete. In meiner Schrift über die unterirdischen Gasarten, welche mein Bruder Wilhelm von Humboldt 1799 während meines Aufenthalts in Südamerika herausgab, wird der Formation, die ich vorläufig mit dem Namen Jura-Kalkstein bezeichnete, zuerst (S. 39) gedacht." ('On a geological tour that I made in 1795 through southern France, western Switzerland and upper Italy, I convinced myself that the Jura limestone, which Werner included in his shell limestone, constituted a separate formation.  In my paper about subterranean types of gases, which my brother Wilhelm von Humboldt published in 1799 during my stay in South America, the formation, which I provisionally designated with the name "Jura limestone", is first conceived (p. 39).'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander von Humboldt]] recognized the mainly [[limestone]] dominated mountain range of the Jura Mountains as a separate formation that had not been included in the established stratigraphic system defined by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]], and he named it "Jura-Kalkstein" ('Jura limestone') in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Ueber die unterirdischen Gasarten und die Mittel, ihren Nachteil zu vermindern, ein Beitrag zur Physik der praktischen Bergbaukunde'' ['On the types of subterranean gases and means of minimizing their harm, a contribution to the physics of practical mining'] (Braunschweig: Vieweg, 1799), [https://books.google.com/books?id=xiQ7AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 39]: "[…] die ausgebreitete Formation, welche zwischen dem alten Gips und neueren Sandstein liegt, und welchen ich vorläufig mit dem Nahmen Jura-Kalkstein bezeichne."

==Etymology==
The name "Jura" is derived from the Celtic root ''*jor'' via Gaulish ''*iuris'' "wooded mountain", which, borrowed into Latin as a place name, evolved into ''Juria'' and finally ''Jura''.&lt;ref name="Hölder, 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arkell, 1956"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rollier, 1903"&gt;Rollier, L. 1903.

==Divisions==
The Jurassic period is divided into three [[Epoch (geology)|epochs]]: Early, Middle, and Late. Similarly, in [[stratigraphy]],  the Jurassic is divided into the [[Lower Jurassic]], [[Middle Jurassic]], and [[Upper Jurassic]] [[Series (stratigraphy)|series]] of rock formations, also known as ''Lias'', ''Dogger'' and ''Malm'' in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Palaeos website"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kazlev|first=M.

During the early Jurassic period, the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] broke up into the northern supercontinent [[Laurasia]] and the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]]; the [[Gulf of Mexico]] opened in the new rift between [[North America]] and what is now Mexico's [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. The Jurassic North [[Atlantic Ocean]] was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotese.com/late1.htm Late Jurassic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys Sea]] closed, and the [[Mediterranean Basin|Neotethys]] basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of [[glacier|glaciation]]. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land over either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed.

The Jurassic geological record is good in western [[Europe]], where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of that future landmass was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]] in southern England and the renowned late Jurassic ''[[lagerstätte]]n'' of [[Holzmaden]] and [[Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urweltmuseum.de/Englisch/museum_eng/Geologie_eng/Tektonik_eng.htm|title=Jurassic Period|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714073301/http://www.urweltmuseum.de/Englisch/museum_eng/Geologie_eng/Tektonik_eng.htm |archivedate=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html|title=map|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715063347/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |archivedate=2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental]] [[Sundance Sea]] left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the United States and Canada during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits of the [[Morrison Formation]].

The Jurassic was a time of [[calcite sea]] geochemistry in which low-magnesium [[calcite]] was the primary inorganic marine precipitate of calcium carbonate. [[Carbonate hardgrounds]] were thus very common, along with calcitic [[ooids]], calcitic cements, and invertebrate faunas with dominantly calcitic skeletons (Stanley and Hardie, 1998, 1999).

The first of several massive [[batholith]]s were emplaced in the northern [[American cordillera]] beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the [[Nevadan orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;Monroe and Wicander, 607.&lt;/ref&gt; Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, Australasia and the United Kingdom.

In Africa, Early Jurassic strata are distributed in a similar fashion to Late Triassic beds, with more common outcrops in the south and less common fossil beds which are predominated by tracks to the north.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-african"/&gt; As the Jurassic proceeded, larger and more iconic groups of dinosaurs like sauropods and ornithopods proliferated in Africa.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-african"/&gt; Middle Jurassic strata are neither well represented nor well studied in Africa.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-african"/&gt; Late Jurassic strata are also poorly represented apart from the spectacular [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru fauna]] in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-african"/&gt; The Late Jurassic life of Tendaguru is very similar to [[Paleobiota of the Morrison Formation|that]] found in western North America's [[Morrison Formation]].&lt;ref name="dinopedia-african"&gt;Jacobs, Louis, L.

==Fauna==

===Aquatic and marine===
During the Jurassic period, the primary vertebrates living in the sea were [[fish]] and marine [[reptile]]s.

On land, various [[archosaur]]ian reptiles remained dominant. The Jurassic was a golden age for the large herbivorous dinosaurs known as the [[sauropod]]s—''[[Camarasaurus]]'', ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', and many others—that roamed the land late in the period; their foraging grounds were either the [[prairie]]s of [[fern]]s, palm-like [[cycad]]s and [[bennettitales]], or the higher coniferous growth, according to their adaptations. The smaller [[Ornithischia]]n herbivore dinosaurs, like [[stegosaur]]s and small [[ornithopod]]s were less predominant, but played important roles. They were preyed upon by large [[theropod]]s, such as ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', ''[[Megalosaurus]]'', ''[[Torvosaurus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]''. All these belong to the 'lizard hipped' or [[saurischia]]n branch of the [[dinosaur]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haines |first=Tim |year=2000 |title=Walking with Dinosaurs: A Natural History |location=New York |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=978-0-7894-5187-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Late Jurassic, the first [[Aves|avialans]], like ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''&lt;!--Archaeopteryx is not included within the class Aves and thus not considered a bird by some scientists, see article on birds--&gt;, [[Evolution|evolved]] from small [[coelurosaur]]ian dinosaurs.

==Flora==

The arid, continental conditions characteristic of the [[Triassic]] steadily eased during the Jurassic period, especially at higher latitudes; the warm, humid climate allowed lush jungles to cover much of the landscape.&lt;ref name="Haines, 2000"&gt;Haines, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gymnosperm]]s were relatively diverse during the Jurassic period.&lt;ref name="Palaeos website"/&gt; The [[Conifers]] in particular dominated the flora, as during the Triassic; they were the most diverse group and constituted the majority of large trees.

Extant conifer families that flourished during the Jurassic included the [[Araucariaceae]], [[Cephalotaxaceae]], [[Pinaceae]], [[Podocarpaceae]], [[Taxaceae]] and [[Taxodiaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;Behrensmeyer ''et al.'', 1992, 349.&lt;/ref&gt; The extinct Mesozoic conifer family [[Cheirolepidiaceae]] dominated low latitude vegetation, as did the shrubby [[Bennettitales]].&lt;ref name="Behrensmeyer et al., 1992, 352"&gt;Behrensmeyer ''et al.'', 1992, 352&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cycad]]s, similar to palm trees, were also common, as were [[ginkgo]]s and [[Dicksoniaceae|Dicksoniaceous]] [[tree ferns]] in the forest.&lt;ref name="Palaeos website"/&gt; Smaller [[fern]]s were probably the dominant undergrowth. [[Caytoniaceae|Caytoniaceous seed ferns]] were another group of important plants during this time and are thought to have been shrub to small-tree sized.&lt;ref&gt;Behrensmeyer ''et al.'', 1992, 353&lt;/ref&gt; Ginkgo plants were particularly common in the mid- to high northern latitudes.&lt;ref name="Palaeos website"/&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, [[podocarps]] were especially successful, while [[Ginkgo]]s and [[Czekanowskiales]] were rare.&lt;ref name="Haines, 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Behrensmeyer et al., 1992, 352"/&gt;

In the oceans, modern [[coralline algae]] appeared for the first time.&lt;ref name="Palaeos website"/&gt; However, they were a part of another major extinction that happened within the next major time period.

Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes are [[tropical cyclone]]s that reach Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity on the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet Earth. They are rare in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] and generally form only once every several years.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; In general, Category&amp;nbsp;5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of [[tropical cyclone]]s in the [[northern hemisphere]].

The term "hurricane" is used for tropical cyclones in the Pacific Ocean, north of the [[equator]] and east of the [[international date line]]. A Category&amp;nbsp;5 Pacific hurricane is therefore a tropical cyclone in the north Pacific Ocean that reached Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity east of the [[international dateline]]. Identical phenomena in the north Pacific Ocean west of the dateline are called "typhoons" or "super typhoons". Category&amp;nbsp;5 super typhoons generally happen several times per season, so cyclones of that intensity are not exceptional for that region. This difference in terminology therefore excludes storms such as [[Typhoon Paka|Super Typhoon Paka]] and [[Typhoon Oliwa (1997)|Super Typhoon Oliwa]] of [[1997 Pacific typhoon season|1997]], and [[Hurricane Genevieve (2014)|Typhoon Genevieve]] of [[2014 Pacific hurricane season|2014]], which formed east of the dateline but did not reach Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity until after crossing the dateline.

Since the [[1950-1969 Pacific hurricane seasons#1959 Season|1959]] season, only 18 hurricanes are known to have reached Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity. There are no known Category&amp;nbsp;5 storms occurring before 1959. It is possible that some earlier storms reached Category&amp;nbsp;5 over open waters, but they were never recognized because they never affected land and remained at sea.&lt;ref name="best track"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] |title=Eastern North Pacific Tracks File 1949-2007 |accessdate=2008-09-14 |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2007_epa.txt |format=plaintext |date=2008-03-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822035410/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2007_epa.txt |archivedate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Category 5 Pacific hurricanes==
[[File:Hurricane Linda Sep 12 1997 1700Z.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hurricane Linda (1997)|Hurricane Linda]] at its peak intensity on September&amp;nbsp;12, 1997.]]
[[File:Patricia 2015-10-23 1730Z (Worldview).jpg|left|thumb|[[Hurricane Patricia]] shortly after its record peak intensity on October&amp;nbsp;23, 2015.]]
This lists all of the Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes in the order in which they formed. Only 1994's Hurricane Emilia and 2006's Hurricane Ioke have reached Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity more than once; that is, by weakening into a Category&amp;nbsp;4 or weaker storm and later re-strengthening to a Category&amp;nbsp;5 storm.

Before the advent of reliable geostationary [[weather satellite|satellite]] coverage in 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated.&lt;ref name=SatelliteCoverage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E10.html|publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]] Hurricane Research Division|work=FAQ: Hurricane, Typhoons, and Tropical Cyclones|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|accessdate=2006-01-04|date=2002-06-11|title=Subject: E10) What are the average, most, and least tropical cyclones occurring in each basin?}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore very possible that there are additional Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes other than those listed, but they were not reported and therefore not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.&lt;ref name="best track"/&gt;

The minimum [[atmospheric pressure|central pressure]] of these storms is, for the most part, estimated from satellite imagery using the [[Dvorak technique]]. In the case of Kenna,&lt;ref name=Kenna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2002kenna.shtml |title=Tropical Cyclone Report Hurricane Kenna |date=2002-12-26 |accessdate=2008-09-14 |author=James Franklin |publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] |authorlink=James Franklin (meteorologist) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716085913/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2002kenna.shtml |archivedate=2014-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ava,&lt;ref name=AvaRecon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/wea01151.htm|work=NOAA Photo Library|accessdate=2008-09-14|author=F.J. Hoelzl|date=1973-06-06|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|title=wea01151, NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia, and Lane, the central pressure was measured by [[hurricane hunter]] aircraft flying into the storm.&lt;ref name="best track"/&gt; Because of the estimation of central pressures, it is possible that other storms more intense than these have formed.&lt;ref name=Guillermo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997guillerm.html|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Guillermo|date=1997-10-02|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2008-09-16|author=[[Max Mayfield]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for estimating the pressure (in lieu of direct measurements) is the fact that most of these storms did not threaten land.&lt;ref name=Recon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/H2.html|publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]] Hurricane Research Division|work=FAQ: Hurricane, Typhoons, and Tropical Cyclones|author=Neal Dorst|accessdate=2006-01-04|title=Subject: H2) Who are the "Hurricane Hunters" and what are they looking for?}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Kenna, Patricia and Lane were threatening land, their pressures were measured by [[Hurricane Hunters]] using [[dropsonde]]s.&lt;ref name=Kenna/&gt; While Hurricane Ava never threatened land,&lt;ref name="best track"/&gt; it too was flown into by Hurricane Hunters to test equipment and conduct research.&lt;ref name=AvaRecon/&gt;

Older storms have incomplete pressure readings, since there were no satellite-based estimates; the only observations were taken by ships, land-based observations, or reconnaissance aircraft when available. Ava's minimum known pressure was measured when it was a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane, for example.&lt;ref name="best track"/&gt; John and Gilma have incomplete pressures because the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]], in general, did not publish pressure on systems in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline) at the time.&lt;ref name=Dalilia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1989-prelim/dalilia/prelim03.gif|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Dalilia|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-01-04|date=1989-08-30|author=Jim Gross|format=GIF|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that this list is not identical to the list of most intense Pacific hurricanes. The most intense known Category&amp;nbsp;4 storm in the eastern Pacific was [[Hurricane Odile|2014's Odile]]. The lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars, lower than that of some Category 5's, such as Guillermo.&lt;ref name="best track"/&gt;

Hurricanes have reached Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity during every month from June to October. The earliest Category&amp;nbsp;5 to form in a season is [[Hurricane Ava (1973)|1973's Hurricane Ava]], which formed on June&amp;nbsp;7. The latest Category&amp;nbsp;5 to form in a season is [[Hurricane Kenna]], which reached peak intensity on October 24. Hurricanes Ava, [[Hurricane Gilma (1994)|Gilma]], [[Hurricane Ioke|Ioke]], [[Hurricane Linda (1997)|Linda]], and [[Hurricane Patricia|Patricia]] are the most intense storms to form in their respective months. There have been no May, November, or off-season Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes.&lt;ref name="best track"/&gt;

Two Pacific hurricanes are known to have reached Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity multiple times: [[Hurricane Emilia (1994)|Emilia]] and [[Hurricane Ioke|Ioke]]. Both did it twice, and Ioke reached Category&amp;nbsp;5 status a third time as a typhoon while in the western Pacific.&lt;ref name="best track"/&gt; Hurricane Ioke was tied for the longest-lasting Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane recorded, spending 42&amp;nbsp;hours at that strength,&lt;ref name=Ioke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2006.php|title=2006 Tropical Cyclones Central North Pacific|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]]|author1=Andy Nash |author2=Tim Craig |author3=Sam Houston |author4=Roy Matsuda |author5=Jeff Powell |author6=Ray Tanabe |author7=Jim Weyman  |last-author-amp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while hurricanes John and Linda had the longest time spent ''consecutively'' at that intensity.&lt;ref name="best track"/&gt;

[[File:Walaka 2018-10-02 0054Z.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Walaka, the second of three Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes during the 2018 season.]]

In the eastern Pacific, Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes usually occur only in [[El Niño]] years. During El Niño years, conditions are more favorable for tropical cyclones because of warmer [[sea surface temperatures]] and reduced [[wind shear]]. This is why Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes cluster in single seasons, with half of the known Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes (nine) having occurred in the 1994, 2002, and 2018 seasons&amp;ndash;the three seasons with the most Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes, at three each. The effects of El Niño are most significant in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline).&lt;ref name=ElNino1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G2.html|publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]] Hurricane Research Division|work=FAQ: Hurricane, Typhoons, and Tropical Cyclones|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|accessdate=2006-01-04|title=Subject: G2) How does El Niño-Southern Oscillation affect tropical cyclone activity around the globe?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general lack of Category&amp;nbsp;5s in non warm-ENSO years is because of there being limited space for development. The prevailing [[ocean current]]s of the area carry warm water to the west. As there is no large piece of land to block the water and cause it to "pile up" like in the Atlantic, the area suitable for all tropical cyclones is small. Farther out to sea, while waters are still warm, wind shear limits the development of tropical cyclones in the waters south of Hawaii. This makes an otherwise ideal region unfavorable for tropical cyclones.

This does not mean that a Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane cannot form outside of an El Niño event. The entire year of 1959 was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, but it had one Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.&lt;ref name=ElNino2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ensoyears.shtml|publisher=[[Climate Prediction Center]]|title=Cold and Warm Episodes by Season|accessdate=2006-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2009, 2010, 2014, and 2015 seasons are the only pairs of seasons in which a Category 5 hurricane formed in consecutive years (Rick and Celia, and Marie and Patricia, respectively).{{EPAC hurricane best track}}

==Landfalls==
[[File:HurricaneKenna2002.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hurricane Kenna]], one of only four Category&amp;nbsp;5 Pacific hurricanes to make landfall at any intensity.]]
Of all of the Category&amp;nbsp;5 Pacific hurricanes, the only ones to make landfall at any intensity were [[Hurricane Kenna]], [[Hurricane Rick (2009)|Hurricane Rick]], [[Hurricane Patricia]], and [[Hurricane Willa]]. None made landfall as Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes; Patricia and Kenna had weakened to Category&amp;nbsp;4 status at the time of their landfalls, Willa had weakened to Category&amp;nbsp;3, and Rick was a tropical storm at its landfall. Patricia was the strongest at landfall among Pacific hurricanes; [[Hurricane Madeline (1976)|1976's Hurricane Madeline]] and [[Hurricane Iniki|1992's Hurricane Iniki]] are tied as the second-strongest storms at landfall, both of which did not reach Category&amp;nbsp;5 strength, but made landfall as stronger Category 4 storms than Kenna.&lt;ref name=Kenna/&gt; Originally, a [[1959 Mexico hurricane|hurricane in 1959]] was thought to have struck Manzanillo at Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity, but a reanalysis in 2016 indicated the storm had peaked as a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane, and made landfall with the same sustained wind speed as Kenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date=2016-02-04|accessdate=2016-02-04|title=Re-analysis of the 1959 Manzanillo Mexico Hurricane|publisher=National Hurricane Center|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/news/20160204_pa_1959HurricaneReanalysis.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia was also originally thought to have made landfall as a Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane near Manzanillo before post-season analysis in 2016.

In addition to these four systems, hurricanes [[Hurricane John (1994)|John]], [[Hurricane Linda (1997)|Linda]], [[Hurricane Ioke|Ioke]], [[Hurricane Lane (2018)|Lane]], and [[Hurricane Walaka|Walaka]] all threatened land at some point during their existence. John, Ioke and Walaka had minimal impacts on [[Johnston Atoll]], John caused heavy surf in [[Hawaii]], and Walaka passed close to [[East Island, Hawaii|East Island]] in the French Frigate Shoals.&lt;ref name=EmiliaJohn/&gt; Linda was briefly forecast to [[List of California tropical storms|approach]] [[southern California]], and it passed close to [[Socorro Island]] near peak intensity.&lt;ref name=Ioke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997linda.html|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Linda|date=1997-10-25|author=[[Max Mayfield]]|accessdate=2006-01-04|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Chris D’Angelo|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=October 23, 2018|accessdate=October 23, 2018|title=Remote Hawaiian Island Wiped Off The Map|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hawaii-east-island-lost-to-hurricane-walaka-french-frigate-shoals-climate-change_us_5bcf2a8ee4b055bc9484e803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the five aforementioned hurricanes, Lane had the most significant impact on land, threatening Hawaii as a major hurricane, and dropping more than {{convert|40|in|mm}} of rain across many areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.newsweek.com/hawaii-hurricane-lane-rainfall-totals-update-extreme-flooding-impacts-1090577|title=Hurricane Lane Hawaii rainfall totals update: ‘Extreme flooding impacts’ continue from tropical storm|author=Newsweek|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the lack of landfalls is that tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west.&lt;ref name=G8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G8.html|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|accessdate=2008-09-14|work=FAQ: Hurricane, Typhoons, and Tropical Cyclones|publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]] Hurricane Research Division|title=Subject: G8) Why do hurricanes hit the East coast of the U.S., but never the West coast?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Atlantic, this sends hurricanes towards North America. In the eastern Pacific, this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear. Hawaii, the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern Pacific, is protected from most hurricanes by a [[subtropical ridge]] and because its land area is small relative to the total ocean area where hurricanes form and travel.

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 5, 2008, a pipeline ruptured at a filet weld, leaking natural gasoline in [[Oologah, Oklahoma]]. About 45,000 gallons of the gasoline were spilled, with about 29,000 gallons being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/02/22/2010-3318/notice-of-lodging-of-consent-decree-pursuant-to-the-clean-water-act#p-2 |title=Federal Register &amp;#124; Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Clean Water Act |publisher=Federalregister.gov |date=February 22, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101020153/https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/02/22/2010-3318/notice-of-lodging-of-consent-decree-pursuant-to-the-clean-water-act |archivedate=November 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 7, a pipeline split open, near [[Denver City, Texas]], spilling {{convert|1.3|e6USgal|m3}} of crude oil. The pipeline company failed to detect and stop the leak for more than 24 hours. [[Electric resistance welding|ERW]] seam failure appears to be the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/272540 |title=Jan. 7, 2008 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203115859/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/272540 |archivedate=February 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/7294570.html |title=Old pipelines are a hidden menace &amp;#124; Energy &amp;#124; Chron.com – Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 11, a Belle Fourche maintenance crew damaged its own pipeline, spilling about 11,100 gallons of crude in [[Alexander, North Dakota]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_1248.html?nocache=1673#_Incidents_tab_3 |title=PHMSA: Stakeholder Communications – Operator Information |author= |date= |work=dot.gov |accessdate=May 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307110237/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/operator/OperatorIM_opid_1248.html?nocache=1673 |archivedate=March 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On March 14, a house in a [[Columbia, Missouri]] neighborhood exploded in an explosion that could be felt for miles, causing fatal injuries to the elderly couple living there. Problems with the gas distribution line there were blamed for the explosion. Another house nearby also suffered damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Michler |first=Caroline |url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2012/09/09/sneed-trial-set-being-tuesday/ |title=Ameren Missouri wrongful death trial set to begin Tuesday |publisher=Columbia Missourian |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119133145/http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2012/09/09/sneed-trial-set-being-tuesday/ |archivedate=January 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 16, a crew boring to install a new gas main hit an existing 4-inch gas line in [[McKinney, Texas]]. Escaping gas caused two houses to explode, and one other house to catch fire.

* On July 28, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois ordered Apex Oil Company Inc., to clean up ground water and soil contamination, at an expected cost of at least $150&amp;nbsp;million. During the period 1967 through 1988, Apex Oil's legal predecessor, Clark Oil and Refining Corp., released gasoline from leaking pipelines and other spills, that commingled with other responsible parties' releases and resulted in the large plume of refined petroleum substances beneath [[Hartford, Illinois]]. Vapors from the underground plume of millions of gallons of leaked and spilled petroleum products have migrated into houses in the village, causing years of fires, explosions, and evacuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2008/2008-07-29-091.html |title=Apex Oil Ordered to Clean Soil, Water Under Illinois Village |publisher=ENS-Newswire.com |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028104405/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2008/2008-07-29-091.html |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 10, a 20-inch crude oil pipeline ruptured near [[Golden Gate, Illinois]]. About 243,000 gallons of crude were spilled, with about 33,000 gallons being lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">'''Magmatic water''' or '''juvenile water''' is water that exists within, and in equilibrium with, a [[magma]] or water-rich [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile]] fluids that are derived from a magma. This magmatic water is released to the atmosphere during a [[volcanic]] eruption. Magmatic water may also be released as [[hydrothermal]] fluids during the late stages of magmatic crystallization or solidification within the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The crystallization of [[hydroxyl]] bearing [[amphibole]] and [[mica]] minerals acts to contain part of the magmatic water within a solidified [[igneous rock]]. Ultimate sources of this magmatic water includes water and hydrous minerals in rocks melted during [[subduction]] as well as [[Water_distribution_on_Earth#Water_in_Earth.27s_mantle|primordial water]] brought up from the deep [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].

==Water in silicate melts==
Water has limited [[solubility]] in silicate melts ranging from almost 0% at surface pressure to 10% at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C and 5 kbar of pressure for a [[granitic]] melt.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Anthony, ''Igneous Petrology'', Longman, 1987, pp. 253-260 {{ISBN|0-582-30174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solubility is lower for more [[mafic]] magmas. As the temperature and pressure drop during emplacement and cooling of the magma a separate [[aqueous]] phase will [[Solid_solution#Exsolution|exsolve]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guilbert&gt;John M. Guilbert and Charles F Park, Jr., ''THe Geology of Ore Deposits'', Freeman, 1986, pp. 32-45 {{ISBN|0-7167-1456-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aqueous phase will be enriched in other volatile and silicate incompatible species such as the metals: [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[silver]] and [[gold]]; [[alkali]]s and [[alkaline earth]]s and others, including: [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], [[boron]], [[rubidium]]; and volatiles: [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]] and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt;

Water in silicate melts at the high temperature and pressure conditions within the crust exists as a [[supercritical fluid]] rather than in a gaseous state (the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] for water is at 374&amp;nbsp;°C and 218 bar).&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;

==Stable isotope data==
[[Stable isotope]] studies of oxygen and hydrogen in igneous rocks indicate that the [[oxygen-18]], δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, content is approximately 6 - 8 ‰ higher than standard mean ocean water ([[SMOW]]) while the [[deuterium]], δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, content is 40 to 80 ‰ lower than SMOW. Water in equilibrium with [[igneous]] melts should bear the same isotopic signature for oxygen-18 and deuterium. Isotope data on hydrothermal solutions spatially associated with [[igneous intrusion]]s should reflect this isotopic signature. However, isotopic studies of hydrothermal waters indicate that most bear the isotopic signature of [[meteoric water]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; Any magmatic waters in these [[hydrothermal]] solutions must have been swamped by the circulating meteoric groundwaters of the environment.

[[Fluid inclusions]] are microscopic bubbles of aqueous solutions which were trapped within crystals during crystallization and are considered as relic samples of the mineralizing waters. Analyses of the isotopic content of these trapped bubbles show a wide range of δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H content.&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt; All examined show an enrichment in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and depletion in &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H relative to SMOW and meteoric waters. Fluid inclusion data from a number of ore deposits plot directly on the magmatic water ''region'' of an δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O vs δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H plot.&lt;ref name=Guilbert/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4133">'''Mountain jets''' are a type of [[jet stream]] created by surface winds channeled through mountain passes, sometimes causing high wind speeds and drastic temperature changes.  

== Central America jets ==
[[Image:Central america winter2001 chlorophyll.jpg|thumb|Chlorophyll growth due to nutrients mixed by 2001 winter jets]]
[[Image:Mean sst equatorial pacific.gif|thumb|Mountain jet effects are apparent in average temperatures around Central America]]

The North Pacific east of about 120°W is strongly influenced by winds blowing through gaps in the Central American cordillera. Air flow in the region forms the '''Intra-Americas Low-Level Jet''', a westward flow about 1&amp;nbsp;km above sea level. This flow, trade winds, and cold air flowing south from North America contribute to winds flowing through several mountain valleys.

Along [[Central America]] are three main wind jets through breaks in the [[American Cordillera]], on the [[Pacific Ocean]] side due to prevailing winds.
* [[Tehuano wind]] blows from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] through [[Chivela Pass]] in [[Mexico]]'s [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and out over the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]] on the Pacific coast. Chivela Pass is a gap between the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] and the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca|Sierra Madre]] range to the south.
* [[Papagayo wind]] shrieks over the lakes of [[Nicaragua]] and pushes far out over the [[Gulf of Papagayo]] on the Pacific coast. The [[Cordillera Central, Andes (disambiguation)|Cordillera Central Mountains]] rise to the south, gradually descending to [[Gatun Lake]] and the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. 
* Panama winds slice through to the Pacific through the [[Gaillard Cut]] in [[Panama]], which also holds the [[Panama Canal]].

=== Cause ===
The air flow is due to surges of cold dense air originating from the [[North America]]n continent.

The meteorological mechanism that causes Tehuano and Papagayo winds is relatively simple. In the winter, cold high-pressure weather systems move southward from North America over the Gulf of Mexico. These high pressure systems create strong pressure gradients between the atmosphere over the Gulf of Mexico and the warmer, moister atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. Just as a river flows from high elevations to lower elevations, the air in the high pressure system will flow "downhill" toward lower pressure, but the Cordillera mountains block the flow of air, channeling it through [[Chivela Pass]] in Mexico, the lake district of Nicaragua, and also Gaillard (Culebra) Cut in Panama. Many times, a Tehuano wind is followed by Papagayo and Panama winds a few days later as the high pressure system moves south.

The arrival of these cold surges, and their associated anticyclonic circulation, strengthens the trade winds at low latitudes, and this effect can last for several days. The wind flow over Central America is actually composed of the confluence of two air streams; one from the north, associated with cold surges, and the other from the northeast, associated with trade winds north of [[South America]].

=== Local effects ===
The winds blow at speeds of 80&amp;nbsp;km/h or more down the hillsides from [[Chivela Pass]] and over the waters of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, sometimes extending more than 500&amp;nbsp;miles (800&amp;nbsp;km) into the Pacific Ocean. The surface waters under the Gulf of Tehuantepec wind jet can cool by as much as 10 °C in a day. In addition to the cold water that is detectable from other satellite sensors, the ocean’s response to these winds shows up in satellite estimates of chlorophyll from ocean color measurements. The cold water and high chlorophyll concentration are signatures of mixing and upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich deep water. Fish converge on this food source, which supports the highly successful fishing industry in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.

'''''Non-Nuclear Futures: The Case for an Ethical Energy Strategy''''' is a 1975 book by [[Amory B. Lovins]] and [[John H. Price]].&lt;ref name=non&gt;Lovins, Amory B. and Price, John H. (1975). ''Non-nuclear Futures: The Case for an Ethical Energy Strategy'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Ballinger Publishing Company, 1975. xxxii + 223pp. {{ISBN|0-88410-602-0}}, {{ISBN|0-88410-603-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberg|first=Alvin M. |date=December 1976|title=Book review.

Lovins and Price suggest that the personal values that make a high-energy society work are all too apparent, and that the values associated with an alternate view relate to thrift, simplicity, diversity, neighbourliness, craftsmanship, and humility.&lt;ref&gt;''Non-Nuclear Futures'', pp. xix-xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also argue that large nuclear generators could not be mass-produced.  Their centralization requires costly transmission and distribution systems.  They are inefficient, not recycling excess thermal energy.  The authors believed that nuclear reactors were less reliable (a [[Capacity factor#Real world capacity factors|grossly incorrect prediction]]) and take longer to build, exposing them to escalated interest costs, mistimed demand forecasts, and wage pressure by unions.

Lovins and Price suggest that these two different sets of personal values and technological attributes lead to two very different policy paths relating to future energy supplies.  The first is high-energy nuclear, centralized, electric; the second is lower energy, non-nuclear, decentralized, less electrified, [[Soft energy technology|softer technology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Non-Nuclear Futures'', p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent publications by other authors which relate to the issue of non-nuclear energy paths are [[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]], [[Plan B 2.0]], [[Reaction Time (book)|Reaction Time]], [[State of the World 2008]], [[The Clean Tech Revolution]], and the work of [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]].

'''North Maluku''' ({{lang-id|Maluku Utara}}) is a [[province of Indonesia]]. It covers the northern part of the [[Maluku Islands]]. The provincial capital is [[Sofifi]], on [[Halmahera]], and the largest population center is the island city of [[Ternate]]. The population of North Maluku was 1,038,087 at the 2010 Census&lt;ref name="bps2010" /&gt; making it one of the least-populous provinces in Indonesia; at the latest estimate (January 2014) the population had risen to 1,141,561. The movement of the regional economy in North Maluku is largely derived from the people's economy which relies on the agricultural sector, fisheries and other types of marine products. The main commodities that support economic pulse in North Maluku include [[copra]], [[nutmeg]], [[Clove|cloves]], [[Fishery|fisheries]], [[gold]] and [[nickel]]. North Maluku's natural products include [[rice]], [[Maize|corn]], roasted sweet potatoes, [[Bean|beans]], [[coconut]], potatoes, nutmeg, [[sago]], and [[eucalyptus]]. The regional economy mostly comes from the people's economy which relies on the agricultural sector, fisheries and other types of marine products.

This area was originally the former region of the four largest Islamic kingdoms in the eastern part of the archipelago known as the Moloku Kie Raha (Four Mountain Sultanate in Maluku). They are the [[Sultanate of Bacan|Bacan Sultanate]], Jailolo Sultanate, [[Sultanate of Tidore|Tidore Sultanate]] and the [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate Sultanate]] respectively. Europeans began arriving in the region at the beginning of the [[16th century]]. North Maluku became the site of competition between the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] to control the trade in the region. In the end, the Dutch emerge victorious, beginning the three century Dutch rule in the region. The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invaded the region during [[World War II]], ousting the Dutch from the region. In the era of [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]] (1942-1945), Ternate became the center of the Japanese ruler's position for the Pacific region. The Japanese [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] in 1945, briefly returning the area to Dutch control, before being handed over to the [[Indonesia|Republic of Indonesia]] after a [[Indonesian National Revolution|war]] between the Dutch and the Indonesian.

North Maluku Province is an area that was created by the division of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku Province]] which officially separated on October 12, 1999. As one of the youngest provinces in 34 provinces in Indonesia, North Maluku was officially formed on October 4, 1999, through Republic of Indonesia Law Number 46 of 1999 and Republic of Indonesia Law Number 6 of 2003. Before officially becoming a province, North Maluku was part of Maluku Province, namely North Maluku Regency. At the beginning of its establishment, North Maluku, whose capital was Ternate, was located at the foot of [[Gamalama|Mount Gamalama]], for 11 years. Precisely until August 4, 2010, after 11 years of transition and infrastructure preparation, the capital of North Maluku Province was moved to [[Sofifi]], located on [[Halmahera]] Island, which is the largest island.

==History==

=== Etymology ===
Historically, the term Maluku referred to the four sultanate centers in North Maluku, namely Ternate, Tidore, Bacan and Jailolo. A certain form of confederation of the four kingdoms which most likely emerged in the 14th century, was called Moloku Kie Raha or "Four Mountain Sultanate in Maluku". Although then the four kingdoms expanded and covered the entire North Maluku region (now) and parts of [[Sulawesi]] and [[New Guinea]], the expansion area was not included in the term Maluku which only referred to the four sultanate centers of North Maluku.

The etymology of the word ''Maluku'' is not very clear, and it has been a matter of debate for many experts. A common theory says that the term ''Maluku'' originates from the [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] phrase ''Jaziratul Muluk'' (جزيرة الملوك), which means "Country of the Kings" (''muluk'' is the plural form of ''malik'', which means king). Thus the Ambon archipelago and parts of the Banda archipelago at that time were not included in the original sense of the term.

=== Pre-colonial era ===
The island of [[Ternate]] began to bustle in the early [[13th century]]. Early Ternate residents were residents of the exodus from [[Halmahera]]. Initially in Ternate there were 4 villages, each headed by a momole (head of the clan). It was they who first made contact with merchants who came from all directions looking for spices. The population of Ternate became increasingly heterogeneous with settlements of [[Arabs|Arab]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] traders. Because of the increasingly busy trading activities were added with threats that often came from pirates, the Momole Guna Tobona leaders held a conference to form a stronger organization and appoint a single leader as king.

In [[1257]], Momole Ciko, Sampalu's leader was elected and appointed as the first kolano (king) with the title Baab Mashur Malamo (1257-1272). The Kingdom of Gapi is centered in the village of Ternate, which in later developments is getting bigger and more crowded so that the population is also referred to as Gam Lamo or the big village (later people call Gam Lamo with Gamalama). The greater and more popular Ternate, so that people would rather say Ternate kingdom than the kingdom of Gapi. Under the leadership of several generations of the next ruler, Ternate developed from a kingdom which only served a small island to become the most influential and largest empire in eastern Indonesia, especially the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]].

In the early days of Ternate people was led by the momole. After forming a kingdom, a leadership position was held by a king called Kolano. Starting in the mid-[[15th century]], Islam was totally adopted by the kingdom and the application of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] was put in place. Sultan Zainal Abidin left the Kolano title and replaced it with the title of [[Sultan]]. The scholars became important figures in the kingdom.

Opposite of Ternate lies the island of [[Tidore]], the seat of the Kingdom of Tidore. According to the genealogies of the kings of Ternate and Tidore, the first King Tidore was Muhammad Naqil who ascended the throne in 1081. It was only at the end of the 14th century that [[Islam]] was made the official religion of the Kingdom of Tidore by 11th King Tidore, Sultan Djamaluddin, who was willing to enter [[Islam]] thanks to the preaching of Sheikh Mansur from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arab]].
[[File:AMH-6727-KB Dutch being entertained by the king of Ternate.jpg|thumb|Dutch being entertained by the king of Ternate]]

=== Colonial era ===
The first European to land in the Moluccas is [[Ludovico di Varthema]], an [[Italians|Italian]] exploler. In 1512, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] set foot in Ternate for the first time under the leadership of [[Francisco Serrão]], with the approval of the sultan, Portugal was allowed to establish a trading post in Ternate. Portugal came not only to trade but to control the trade in [[Spice|spices]], [[nutmeg]] and [[Clove|cloves]] in Maluku. For this reason, they must first conquer Ternate.

Sultan Bayanullah died leaving the heirs who were still very young. The widow of the sultan, Consort Nukila and Prince Taruwese, sister of the deceased sultan acted as guardian. Empress Nukila from [[Tidore]] intended to unite Ternate and Tidore under one crown, one of his two sons, Pangeran Hidayat (later Sultan Dayalu) and prince Abu Hayat (later Sultan Abu Hayat II). While Prince Tarruwese wanted a throne for himself.

The Portuguese took advantage of this opportunity and pitted both of them until a civil war broke out. Empress Nukila's side was supported by Tidore while Prince Taruwese was supported by Portugal. After winning the victory Prince Taruwese was betrayed and killed by Portugal. The governor of Portugal acted as an adviser to the kingdom and with influence had succeeded in persuading the royal council to appoint prince Tabariji as sultan. But when Sultan Tabariji began to show hostility, he was slandered and exiled to [[Goa]], [[India]]. There he was forced by Portugal to sign an agreement to make Ternate a Christian kingdom and a royal vassal of Portugal, but the agreement was flatly rejected by Sultan Khairun.

Portugal's treatment of his brothers made Sultan Khairun furious and determined to drive Portugal from Maluku. Portugal's actions caused anger among the people who finally stood behind Sultan Khairun. In response, the Portuguese governor, Lopez de Mesquita invited Sultan Khairun to a conference to negotiate before cruelly murdering the sultan who came without his bodyguard.

The assassination of Sultan Khairun increasingly encouraged the people of Ternate to expel Portugal, even the entire Moluccas now supported the leadership and struggle of [[Sultan Babullah of Ternate|Sultan Baabullah]], the fortress of Portugal throughout Maluku and the eastern regions of Indonesia were attacked. After 5 years of war, Portugal finally were expelled from Maluku in 1575. Under the leadership of Sultan Baabullah, Ternate reached its peak, the area stretched from [[North Sulawesi|North]] and [[Central Sulawesi]] in the west to the [[Marshall Islands]] in the east, from the southern [[Philippines]] in the north to the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] in the south.

After Sultan Baabullah died, the sultanate began to weaken, the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] which had [[Iberian Union|united]] with Portugal in 1580 tried to regain control of Maluku by attacking Ternate. With Spain's new power strengthening its position in the [[Philippines]], Ternate also formed an alliance with [[Mindanao]] to drive Spain away but failed, even Sultan Said Barakati was captured by the Spaniards and thrown into exile in [[Manila]].

The sultanate requested the help of the [[Netherlands]] in [[1603]]. The Dutch expelled the Spanish from Maluku. On June 26, 1607 the Sultan of Ternate signed a  monopoly contract in Maluku in return for Dutch assistance against Spain. In [[1607]], the Dutch also built the [[Fort Oranje (Ternate)|Fort Oranje]] on Ternate, which was their first stronghold in the archipelago. From the beginning, unhealthy and unbalanced relations between the Netherlands and Ternate caused dissatisfaction with the rulers and nobles of Ternate. Among them are Prince Hidayat, the Ambonese young king who was also a former regent of Ternate, leading the opposition who opposed the position of the sultan and the Dutch. He ignored the Dutch trade monopoly agreement by selling spices to [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Makassar people|Makassar]] traders. Meanwhile, the [[Sultanate of Tidore]], succeeded in rejecting Dutch presence in their territory and remained an independent area until the end of the [[18th century]]. But this did not last long because the [[Dutch East India Company]] formed by the Dutch to control the spice trade in Maluku succeeded in conquering Ternate and Tidore with an orderly, neat and controlled strategy and procedure in the form of a strong organization. In the end, both Ternate and Tidore as well as other kingdoms in Maluku were annexed into the [[Dutch East Indies]]. For the next three century, the archipelago would remain under Dutch control.

=== Modern era ===
The [[Empire of Japan]] invaded Maluku early in 1942 as part of its [[Dutch East Indies Campaign]] of [[World War II]], ousting the Dutch from the region. Halmahera became the site of a [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] naval base at [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]] Bay. 2 years later, [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] and their allies launched the [[Battle of Morotai]] in 1944; bombing the island in August and invading it in September. [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese forces]] on Morotai held out until 1945 but failed to expel the Allied invaders. In the latter part of 1944, 61,000 personnel landed on Morotai.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=102}} Two thirds of them were engineers, who rapidly established facilities including harbors and two airstrips{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=102}} plus extensive fuel stores. The formal surrender of the Second Japanese Army took place at Morotai on 9 September 1945. The last [[Japanese holdout]] from the war, Private [[Teruo Nakamura]] ([[Amis language|Amis]]: Attun Palalin), was discovered by the [[Indonesian Air Force]] on Morotai, and surrendered to a search patrol on December 18, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Last Last Soldier?|date=January 13, 1975|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917064,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|newspaper=Time}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Japanese surrendered, the Dutch regained control of the region, before handing it over to the Indonesian government in 1949. In [[1957]], the [[Permesta]] movement was declared in [[Manado]], [[North Sulawesi]], aiming to overthrow the Indonesian government, The movement received support from the [[United States]] and [[Taiwan]]. In January 1958 the CIA began developing covert support networks to the PRRI and Permesta rebels. Supported by the American, Permesta forces captures Morotai and Halmahera as well as several islands. On May 1958 [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] started to gather amphibious forces to retake both Morotai and the rebel-held town of [[Jailolo (town)|Jailolo]] on the island of [[Halmahera]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=134}} By May 16 the assault fleet started to gather in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] harbour and on May 20 its troops landed on Morotai while élite ''Pasukan Gerak Tjepat'' (PGT or "Quick Reaction Force") troops parachuted onto the island.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} The Permesta force's surrender was as quick as its capture of the island less than a month before.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} It alarmed the Permesta rebels who had captured Jailolo, many of whom promptly fled back to [[North Sulawesi]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=147}} Thereafter the rebellion was largely confined to the [[Minahassa Peninsula]] of Sulawesi, where Permesta remnants waged a guerilla campaign until the last unit surrendered in January 1962.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=161}}

During the administration of President [[B. J. Habibie]], the idea emerged to accelerate development in several potential regions by forming new provinces. Maluku is one of the potential areas for accelerating development through the expansion of the province, mainly because of the pace of development between the northern and southern regions and or between the middle and southeast regions that are not harmonious. On that basis, the government established North Maluku Province (with the temporary capital in Ternate) which was confirmed by Law Number 46 of 1999 concerning the division of North Maluku Province, [[Buru Regency]] and [[Western Southeast Maluku Regency]].&lt;ref&gt;Lembaran Negara Tahun 1999 Nomor 174, Tambahan Lembaran Negera Nomor 3895&lt;/ref&gt;

North Maluku was also the site of the [[Maluku sectarian conflict]]. Although the area is more peaceful than the neighbouring Maluku province, there were several clashes between Christians and Muslims in Ternate and Halmahera. Several people were killed in [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]], Halmahera as residents of both faiths and [[Makian|Makianese]] Muslim migrants fought for three days, and the majority of sources state that the violence had started with the invasion of Sosol, one of the two villages destroyed by the Makianese gang.&lt;ref name=north&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Christopher R.|title=The Other Maluku: Chronologies of Conflict in North Maluku|journal=Indonesia|date=October 2005|volume=80|series=Southeast Asia Program Publications at Cornell University|pages=53–80|jstor=3351319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="braith200"&gt;{{harvnb|Braithwaite|2010|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of leaders was tasked with securing peace by the regional government, however no modifications were made to the [[redistricting]] decision and tension remained.&lt;ref name="braith200" /&gt; The conflict spread from Halmahera to neighbouring Ternate and Tidore. On 6 November 1999, a several-hundred strong Muslim gang, led by local Makianese political elite and thought to be mostly Makianese refugees, raged through [[Ternate]] attacking the Christian minority there also.&lt;ref name=braith202&gt;{{harvnb|Braithwaite|2010|pp=202–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police forces of Ternate were only able to guard their own institutions from attack, yet the traditional guards of the [[Sultan]] of Ternate, mostly composed of local Ternate Muslims, were particularly effective at protecting the local Christian population from attack.&lt;ref name="north2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="braith214"&gt;{{harvnb|Braithwaite|2010|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan's guard had both established secure perimeters around areas of the city, including the mostly [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-owned]] business district, and physically stood between the mobs and possible victims in some cases and were later commended for preventing a potential massacre. At least 4 people died, however, and the Indonesian Navy later evacuated the several thousand Christian residents of both islands to [[Bintung]] and [[Manado]] in [[North Sulawesi]].

The conflict was finally resolved after the [[Malino II Accord]] was signed by both parties.

==Geography==
The islands of North Maluku are mostly of volcanic origin, with the volcanoes of [[Dukono]] on Halmahera, [[Gamalama]] on Ternate still active and the whole of Tidore consisting of a large [[stratovolcano]]. The [[rainforest]]s of [[Halmahera]], [[Morotai]], the [[Obi Islands]], the [[Bacan]] islands and other islands of North Maluku have been described by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the "Halmahera rain forests" [[ecoregion]] and are home to a number of plant and animal species unique to the islands, which are in the [[Wallacea]] transition zone, containing a mixture of species of Asian and [[Australasia ecozone|Australasian]] origin. The predominant trees of the forest are ''[[Anisoptera thurifera]]'', ''[[Hopea gregaria]]'', ''[[Hopea iriana]]'', ''[[Shorea assamica]]'', ''[[Shorea montigena]]'', ''[[Shorea selanica]]'', and ''[[Vatica rassak]]''.

The endemic mammals found here include the [[Obi mosaic-tailed rat]] (''Melomys obiensis''), [[masked flying fox]] (''Pteropus personatus''), and three arboreal [[marsupial]]s, the [[ornate cuscus|ornate]] (''Phalanger ornatus''), [[Rothschild's cuscus|Rothschild's]] (''P. rothschildi''), [[blue-eyed cuscus|blue-eyed]] (''P. matabiru'') and [[Gebe cuscus|Gebe]] (''P. alexandrae'') [[cuscus]]es. There are over two hundred different birds on the islands, twenty-six of which are endemic, a large number for this small island group. The endemics include four birds which are the only species in their [[genera]], including the elusive [[invisible rail]] (''Habroptila wallacii''), the [[white-streaked friarbird]] (''Melitograis gilolensis''), and two birds of paradise, the [[paradise-crow]] (''Lycocorax pyrrhopterus'') and [[Wallace's standardwing]] (''Semioptera wallacii''). The islands are also home to the largest bee in the world, [[Wallace's giant bee]] (''Megachile pluto'').&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Halmahera Rain Forests|id=aa0106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands have a [[tropical rainforest climate]].

Most of the natural forest remains on these mountainous islands, although much of the coastal and lowland areas have been cleared for clove-planting since the sixteenth century, especially on the islands of Ternate and [[Tidore]]. Logging has occurred more recently on Halmahera and Morotai.

The North Maluku Islands are formed by the movement of three tectonic plates, namely [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasia]], the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australia]] which have occurred since the time of lime. this movement formed the archipelago volcanic archipelago that stretched from north to south in western Halmahera, including Ternate Island, Tidore Island, Moti Island, Mare Island and Makian Island. Halmahera Island itself is a volcanic island even though volcanic activity occurs only in a part of its territory.

==Administrative divisions==
North Maluku Province was subdivided into seven [[Regency (Indonesia)|regencies]] and two autonomous [[Cities of Indonesia|cities]], listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and at the latest (2014) Estimates. An eighth regency, covering '''Taliabu Island''', was formed in 2013 from the westernmost island in the Sula Islands Residency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3322">'''PoSAT-1''', the first [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[satellite]], was launched into [[orbit]] on September 26, 1993, on the 59th flight of the [[Ariane 4]] rocket. The launch took place in the [[Guiana Space Centre|Kourou Space Centre]], [[French Guiana]]. About 20 minutes and 35 seconds after launch, at an altitude of 807&amp;nbsp;km, PoSAT-1 separated itself from the rocket.

The PoSAT-1 weighs about 50&amp;nbsp;kg and belongs to the class of [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellites]], which are between 10 and 100&amp;nbsp;kg. The entire project was developed by a consortium of universities and companies in [[Portugal]] and was built at the University of [[Surrey]], [[UK]]. The total cost was around €5 Million, about €3 Million paid by the Portuguese Government and €2 Million by the Portuguese companies involved (Po-SAT consortium: [[Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inovação|INETI]], [[EFACEC]], ALCATEL, MARCONI, [[OGMA]], [[Instituto Superior Técnico|IST]], [[University of Beira Interior|UBI]] and CEDINTEC). The responsible for the project was [[Fernando Carvalho Rodrigues]], known as the father of the first Portuguese satellite.

The mission was called ''Flight 59'', which launched several satellites: ''PoSAT-1'' from Portugal, ''[[EyeSat]]'' and ''[[ItamSat]]'' from [[Italy]], ''[[KitSat-B]]'' from [[South Korea]], ''[[HealthSat]]'' (an international medical satellite) and ''[[Stella satellite|Stella]]'' and ''[[SPOT (satellite)#SPOT 1.2C 2.2C and 3|SPOT-3]]'' from France, the latter one a super satellite for photography recognition.

== The Satellite==
The PoSAT-1 is a box of [[aluminum]], in the form of a [[parallelepiped]], 58 centimeters long, 35 centimeters wide, 35 centimeters depth and weighs 50 kilograms.
Over a first drawer that contains the batteries and the [[Remote Sensing|remote detection]] module are stacked 10 other drawers full of electronic cards.
At the top of the satellite there are sensors for attitude and the stabilization mast, essential tools for PoSAT-1 to maintain correct orbit.

Four [[solar panel]]s are mounted on the lateral sides of the structure of the satellite, forming a parallelepiped, which are the source of [[energy]] for all on-board systems. Each panel contains 1,344 cells of GaAs.

== Numbers ==
* ''Speed'': 7.3&amp;nbsp;km per second.
* ''Orbit'': 822 x 800&amp;nbsp;km, inclination of 98.6 °, [[Sun synchronous orbit|Sun synchronous]], lasts 101 minutes, revolves around the Earth around 14 times per day.

== Death ==
The physical death of the PoSAT-1 is expected to be 2043.
PoSAT-1 stopped transmitting information to Earth in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2352">The '''primitive mantle''' is, in [[geochemistry]], a hypothetical [[reservoir (geochemistry)|reservoir]] with the composition of the [[Earth's crust]] and [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] taken together.

The currently accepted scientific hypothesis is that the Earth was formed by [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of material with a [[chondrite|chondritic]] composition. Still during the accretionary phase [[planetary differentiation]] started, giving rise to the [[Structure_of_the_Earth#Core|Earth's core]], where heavy metallic [[Siderophile element|siderophile]] elements accumulated. Around it was a (in this stage) undifferentiated mantle, the primitive mantle. Further differentiation would take place later, creating the different chemical reservoirs of crust and mantle, with [[incompatible element]]s accumulating in the crust.

Today differentiation still continues in the [[upper mantle]]. Reservoirs depleted in [[Goldschmidt classification|lithophile]] elements are called ''depleted'', "fresh" undifferentiated parts of the mantle are called ''enriched'' or ''primitive''. The last name is confusing but derives from the fact that such reservoirs are comparable in composition to the primitive mantle. [[Volcanic rock]]s from [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot areas]] often have a primitive composition. Because the [[magma]] at hotspots is supposed to have been taken to the surface from the deepest regions of the mantle by [[mantle plume]]s, geochemists assume there must be a relatively closed reservoir of very primitive composition somewhere in the lower mantle. One of the hypotheses is this is the so-called [[D"|D"-layer]] at the core-mantle boundary.

The ''Late veneer hypothesis'' suggests that specific materials were added at the surface from extra external sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kremer | first = William | title = Does gold come from outer space? | work = BBC Magazine | publisher = BBC World Service| date = 19 September 2013 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22904141 |accessdate = 19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are arguments against this hypothesis &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsu.edu/news/2008/05/01/humayun.theory/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockcollector.co.uk/editorial0508.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microfabrication]], '''thermal oxidation''' is a way to produce a thin layer of [[oxide]] (usually [[silicon dioxide]]) on the surface of a [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]].  The technique forces an oxidizing agent to diffuse into the wafer at high temperature and react with it.  The rate of oxide growth is often predicted by the [[Deal-Grove model]].&lt;ref name="slo"&gt; {{cite journal| last1= Liu| first1=M.| last2= et al. |title=  Two-dimensional modeling of the self-limiting oxidation in silicon and tungsten nanowires | journal= Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters  | year= 2016 |  volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=195–199 | url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209503491630040X| doi= 10.1016/j.taml.2016.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thermal oxidation may be applied to different materials, but most commonly involves the oxidation of [[silicon]] substrates to produce [[silicon dioxide]].

== The chemical reaction ==
Thermal oxidation of silicon is usually performed at a temperature between 800 and 1200 [[Celsius|°C]], resulting in so called '''High Temperature Oxide''' layer (HTO). It may use either [[water vapor]] (usually [[Ultra High Purity Steam for Oxidation and Annealing|UHP steam]]) or molecular [[oxygen]] as the oxidant; it is consequently called either ''wet'' or ''dry'' oxidation.  The reaction is one of the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\rm Si + 2H_2O \rightarrow SiO_2 + 2H_{2\ (g)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rm Si + O_2 \rightarrow SiO_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The oxidizing ambient may also contain several percent of [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl).  The chlorine removes metal ions that may occur in the oxide.

Thermal oxide incorporates silicon consumed from the substrate and oxygen supplied from the ambient.  Thus, it grows both down into the wafer and up out of it.  For every unit thickness of silicon consumed, 2.17 unit thicknesses of oxide will appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~yosish/courses/vlsi1/I-4-1-Oxidation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121212852/http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~yosish/courses/vlsi1/I-4-1-Oxidation.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a bare silicon surface is oxidized, 44% of the oxide thickness will lie below the original surface, and 56% above it.

=== Deal-Grove model ===
{{main article|Deal-Grove model}}
According to the commonly used Deal-Grove model, the time ''τ'' required to grow an oxide of thickness ''X&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'', at a constant temperature, on a bare silicon surface, is:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac{X_o^2}{B} + \frac{X_o}{(\frac{B}{A})}&lt;/math&gt;
where the constants A and B relate to properties of the reaction and the oxide layer, respectively. This model has further been adapted to account for '''self-limiting''' oxidation processes, as used for the fabrication and morphological design of [[Silicon Nanowire|Si nanowires]] and other nanostructures.&lt;ref name="slo" /&gt;

If a [[wafer (semiconductor)|wafer]] that already contains oxide is placed in an oxidizing ambient, this equation must be modified by adding a corrective term τ, the time that would have been required to grow the pre-existing oxide under current conditions.  This term may be found using the equation for ''t'' above.

Solving the quadratic equation for ''X&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' yields:
:&lt;math&gt;X_o(t) = A/2 \cdot \left[ \sqrt{1+\frac{4B}{A^2}(t+\tau)} - 1 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

== Oxidation technology ==
Most thermal oxidation is performed in [[furnace]]s, at temperatures between 800 and 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.  A single furnace accepts many wafers at the same time, in a specially designed [[quartz]] rack (called a "boat").  Historically, the boat entered the oxidation chamber from the side (this design is called "horizontal"), and held the wafers vertically, beside each other.  However, many modern designs hold the wafers horizontally, above and below each other, and load them into the oxidation chamber from below....

Vertical furnaces stand higher than horizontal furnaces, so they may not fit into some microfabrication facilities.  However, they help to prevent [[dust]] contamination.  Unlike horizontal furnaces, in which falling dust can contaminate any wafer, vertical furnaces use enclosed cabinets with air filtration systems to prevent dust from reaching the wafers.

Vertical furnaces also eliminate an issue that plagued horizontal furnaces: non-uniformity of grown oxide across the wafer{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}.  Horizontal furnaces typically have convection currents inside the tube which causes the bottom of the tube to be slightly colder than the top of the tube.  As the wafers lie vertically in the tube the convection and the temperature gradient with it causes the top of the wafer to have a thicker oxide than the bottom of the wafer.  Vertical furnaces solve this problem by having wafer sitting horizontally, and then having the gas flow in the furnace flowing from top to bottom, significantly damping any thermal convections.

Vertical furnaces also allow the use of load locks to purge the wafers with nitrogen before oxidation to limit the growth of native oxide on the Si surface.

== Oxide quality ==
Wet oxidation is preferred to dry oxidation for growing thick oxides, because of the higher growth rate.  However, fast oxidation leaves more [[dangling bond]]s at the silicon interface, which produce [[quantum state]]s for electrons and allow current to leak along the interface.  (This is called a "dirty" interface.)  Wet oxidation also yields a lower-[[density]] oxide, with lower [[dielectric strength]].

The long time required to grow a thick oxide in dry oxidation makes this process impractical.  Thick oxides are usually grown with a long wet oxidation bracketed by short dry ones (a ''dry-wet-dry'' cycle).  The beginning and ending dry oxidations produce films of high-quality oxide at the outer and inner surfaces of the oxide layer, respectively.

Mobile [[metal]] [[ion]]s can degrade performance of [[MOSFET]]s ([[sodium]] is of particular concern).  However, [[chlorine]] can immobilize sodium by forming [[sodium chloride]].  Chlorine is often introduced by adding [[hydrogen chloride]] or [[trichloroethylene]] to the oxidizing medium.  Its presence also increases the rate of oxidation.

== Other notes ==
* Thermal oxidation can be performed on selected areas of a wafer, and blocked on others.  This process, first developed at Philips,&lt;ref&gt;J. Appels, E. Kooi, M. M. Paffen, J. J. H. Schatorje, and W. H. C. G. Verkuylen, “Local oxidation of silicon and its application in semiconductor-device technology,” PHILIPS RESEARCH Reports, vol. 25, no. 2, pp. 118–132, Apr. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly referred to as the Local Oxidation of Silicon ([[LOCOS]]) process.  Areas which are not to be oxidized are covered with a film of [[silicon nitride]], which blocks diffusion of oxygen and water vapor due to its oxidation at a much slower rate.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuiper, M. Willemsen, J. M. G. Bax, and F. H. P. H. Habraken, “Oxidation behaviour of LPCVD silicon oxynitride films,” Applied Surface Science, vol. 33, no. 34, pp. 757–764, Oct. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  The nitride is removed after oxidation is complete.  This process cannot produce sharp features, because lateral (parallel to the surface) diffusion of oxidant molecules under the nitride mask causes the oxide to protrude into the masked area.
* Because impurities [[solvation|dissolve]] differently in silicon and oxide, a growing oxide will selectively take up or reject [[dopant]]s.  This redistribution is governed by the [[segregation coefficient]], which determines how strongly the oxide absorbs or rejects the dopant, and the [[diffusivity]]{{siadn|date=August 2015}}.
* The orientation of the silicon [[crystal]] affects oxidation.  A &lt;100&gt; wafer (see [[Miller indices]]) oxidizes more slowly than a &lt;111&gt; wafer, but produces an electrically cleaner oxide interface.
* Thermal oxidation of any variety produces a higher-quality oxide, with a much cleaner interface, than [[chemical vapor deposition]] of oxide resulting in '''Low Temperature Oxide''' layer (reaction of [[Tetraethyl orthosilicate|TEOS]] at about 600&amp;nbsp;°C).  However, the high temperatures required to produce High Temperature Oxide (HTO) restrict its usability.  For instance, in [[MOSFET]] processes, thermal oxidation is never performed after the doping for the source and drain terminals is performed, because it would disturb the placement of the dopants.

The '''Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer''' ('''TOMS''') is a [[NASA]] satellite instrument for measuring [[ozone]] values. Of the five TOMS instruments which were built, four entered successful orbit. [[Nimbus program|Nimbus-7]] and [[Meteor (satellite)|Meteor-3-5]] provided global measurements of [[column density|total column]] ozone on a daily basis and together provided a complete data set of daily ozone from November 1978 to December 1994. After an eighteen-month period when the program had no on-orbit capability, {{nowrap|[[ADEOS I]]}} was launched on August 17, 1996, and provided data until the satellite which housed it lost power on June 29, 1997. TOMS-Earth&amp;nbsp;Probe was launched on July 2, 1996, to provide supplemental measurements, and was later boosted to a higher orbit to replace the failed ADEOS&amp;nbsp;I. The only total failure in the series was QuikTOMS, which was launched on September 21, 2001, but did not achieve orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20010705quiktoms.html |title=QuikTOMS Mission |publisher=NASA |date=July 10, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010821121343/https://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20010705quiktoms.html |archivedate=August 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transmitter for TOMS-Earth&amp;nbsp;Probe failed on December 2, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/news/news.html#mar05 |title=News |series=Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer |publisher=NASA |date=March 5, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829044403/http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/news/news.html#mar05 |archivedate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Upper-atmospheric lightning''' or '''ionospheric lightning''' are terms sometimes used by researchers to refer to a family of short-lived electrical-breakdown phenomena that occur well above the altitudes of normal [[lightning]] and storm clouds. Upper-atmospheric lightning is believed to be electrically induced forms of luminous [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The preferred usage is '''transient luminous event''' (TLE), because the various types of electrical-discharge phenomena in the upper atmosphere lack several characteristics of the more familiar tropospheric lightning.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Midsummer Night Brings Sprites.jpg|thumb|Midsummer night sprites at [[La Silla Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Midsummer Night Brings Sprites|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1505a/|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are several types of TLEs, the most common being [[sprite (lightning)|sprites]]. Sprites are flashes of bright red light that occur above [[storm]] systems. C-sprites (short for “columniform sprites”) is the name given to vertical columns of red light. C-sprites exhibiting tendrils are sometimes called “carrot sprites”. Other types of TLEs include sprite halos, blue jets, gigantic jets, blue starters, and ELVESs. The acronym ELVES (“[[Emission spectrum|Emission of Light]] and [[Very Low Frequency]] perturbations due to [[Electromagnetic Pulse]] Sources”) refers to a singular event which is commonly thought of as being plural. TLEs are secondary phenomena that occur in the upper atmosphere in association with underlying [[thunderstorm]] [[lightning]].

TLEs generally last anywhere from less than a [[millisecond]] to more than 2&amp;nbsp;seconds. The first video recording of a TLE was captured accidentally on July 6,1989. Researcher R.C Franz had set up the camera to be used on a future rocket launch and pointed the camera to view the night sky at zenith to capture images of star fields and or what ever appeared. He left the camera running for the duration of the night The next morning when the video was viewed there were 2 finger like vertical images, appearing in only two frames of the film. The next video recordings of a TLE in 1989 was during the Shuttle Mission STS-34 while conducting the Mesoscale Lightning Observation Experiment. On October 21,1989 TLE'S were recorded during the Shuttle orbits 44 and 45. TLEs have been captured by a variety of [[optical recording]] systems, with the total number of recent recorded events (early 2009) estimated at many tens-of-thousands. The global rate of TLE occurrence has been estimated from satellite ([[FORMOSAT-2]]) observations to be several million events per year.

==History==
In the 1920s, the Scottish physicist [[Charles Thomson Rees Wilson|C.T.R. Wilson]] predicted that electrical breakdown should occur in the atmosphere high above large thunderstorms.&lt;ref&gt;C. T. R. Wilson (1924) "The electric field of a thundercloud and some of its effects," ''Proceedings of the Physical Society of London'', '''37''' (1) : 32D-37D.  Available on-line at:  [http://www.storm-t.iag.usp.br/pub/ACA0330/papers/Wilson_electricfield_thunderstorms_1924.pdf University of São Paulo].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earle R. Williams (November 2001) "Sprites, elves, and glow discharge tubes," ''Physics Today'', '''54''' (11) :  41–47.  Available on-line at:  [http://physicstoday.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_54/iss_11/41_1.shtml?bypassSSO=1 ''Physics Today''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120527085255/http://physicstoday.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_54/iss_11/41_1.shtml?bypassSSO=1 |date=2012-05-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ensuing decades, high altitude electrical discharges were reported by aircraft pilots and discounted by [[Meteorology|meteorologists]] until the first direct visual evidence was documented in 1989. Several years later, the optical signatures of these events were named 'sprites' by researchers to avoid inadvertently implying physical properties that were, at the time, still unknown. The terms '''''red sprites''''' and '''''blue jets''''' gained popularity after a video clip was circulated following an aircraft research campaign to study sprites in 1994.

'''Sprites''' are large-scale [[electrical discharge]]s which occur high above a [[thunderstorm]] cloud, or [[cumulonimbus]], giving rise to a quite varied range of visual shapes. They are triggered by the discharges of [[Positive lightning#Positive lightning|positive lightning]] between the thundercloud and the ground.&lt;ref name="boccippio"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boccippio |first1=D.

==Jets==
Although jets are considered to be a type of upper-atmospheric lightning, it has been found that they are components of tropospheric lightning and a type of cloud-to-air discharge that initiates within a thunderstorm and travel upwards. In contrast, other types of TLEs are not electrically connected with tropospheric lightning-- despite being triggered by it. The two main types of jets are ''blue jets'' and ''gigantic jets''. ''Blue starters'' are considered to be a weaker form of blue jets.

===Blue jets===
[[File:BlueJet.jpg|thumb|Blue jet as seen from the summit of Maunakea, Hawaii.]]
'''Blue jets''' are believed to be initiated as "normal" lightning discharges between the upper positive charge region in a thundercloud and a negative "screening layer" present above this charge region. The positive end of the [[leader_(spark)|leader]] network fills the negative charge region before the negative end fills the positive charge region, and the positive leader subsequently exits the cloud and propagates upward. It was previously believed that blue jets were not directly related to lightning flashes, and that the presence of [[hail]] somehow led to their occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/ur/2001/bluejets.html Fractal Models of Blue Jets, Blue Starters Show Similarity, Differences to Red Sprites]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also brighter than sprites and, as implied by their name, are blue in color. The color is believed to be due to a set of blue and near-[[ultraviolet]] emission lines from neutral and ionized molecular [[nitrogen]]. They were first recorded on October 21, 1989, on a [[monochrome]] video of a thunderstorm on the horizon taken from the [[Space Shuttle]] as it passed over [[Australia]]. Blue jets occur much less frequently than sprites. By 2007, fewer than a hundred images had been obtained. The majority of these images, which include the first color imagery, are associated with a single thunderstorm. These were taken in a series of 1994 aircraft flights to study sprites.&lt;ref&gt;'Red Sprites &amp; Blue Jets – the video'[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xVThAFfP0E], 'Blue Jets &amp; Blue Starters – the video'[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSeTy-EBe4o].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue starters===
'''Blue starters''' were discovered on video from a night time research flight around thunderstorms&lt;ref&gt;Examples may be seen in the clip 'Blue Jets &amp; Blue Starters – the video' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSeTy-EBe4o].&lt;/ref&gt; and appear to be "an upward moving luminous phenomenon closely related to blue jets."&lt;ref name="space shuttle"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://lightning.nsstc.nasa.gov/bookshelf/pubs/sprites.html |title=The Role of the Space Shuttle Videotapes in the Discovery of Sprites, Jets, and Elves |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |first1=W.

Pasko, associate professor of electrical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630142356/http://www.spaceref.ca/news/viewpr.html?pid=6878 Fractal models of blue jets, blue starters show similarity, differences to red sprites]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gigantic jets===

[[File:Giganticjet2.png|thumbnail|Gigantic Jet in Oro Verde, Argentina, 2014/02/02]]
Where blue jets are believed to initiate between the upper positive charge region and a negative screening layer directly above this region, '''Gigantic jets''' appear to initiate between the upper positive and lower negative charge regions in the thundercloud. In a similar process to how blue jets form, the higher charge region is discharged by the leader network before the same occurs in the lower charge region, and one end of the leader network propagates upward from the cloud toward the ionosphere. Gigantic jets reach higher altitudes than blue jets, and the upper portion of the jet changes color from blue to red.

====Observations====
On September 14, 2001, scientists at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] photographed a gigantic jet—double the height of those previously observed—reaching around {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v416/n6877/abs/416152a.html V.P. Pasko, M.A. Stanley, J.D. Matthews, U.S. Inan, and T.G. Wood (March 14, 2002) ]"Electrical discharge from a thundercloud top to the lower ionosphere," ''Nature'', vol. 416, pages 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt; The jet was located above a thunderstorm over an ocean, and lasted under a second. The jet was initially observed to be traveling up at around 50,000&amp;nbsp;m/s at a speed similar to typical lightning, increased to 160,000 and then 270,000&amp;nbsp;m/s, but then split in two and sped upward with speeds of at least 2,000,000&amp;nbsp;m/s to the [[ionosphere]] where it then spread out in a bright burst of light.

On July 22, 2002, five gigantic jets between 60 and 70&amp;nbsp;km (35 to 45 miles) in length were observed over the [[South China Sea]] from [[Taiwan]], reported in ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sprite.phys.ncku.edu.tw/new/news/0626_presss/nature01759_r.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702211900/http://sprite.phys.ncku.edu.tw/new/news/0626_presss/nature01759_r.pdf |archive-date=2007-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/17758 Giant jets caught on camera]&lt;/ref&gt; The jets lasted under a second, with shapes likened by the researchers to giant trees and carrots.

On November 10, 2012, the Chinese Science Bulletin reported a gigantic jet event observed over a thunderstorm in mainland [[China]] on August 12, 2010. "GJ event that was clearly recorded in eastern China (storm center located at 35.6°N,119.8°E, near the [[Huanghai Sea]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://csb.scichina.com:8080/kxtbe/EN/10.1007/s11434-012-5486-3 |title=Chinese Science Bulletin 2012, Vol. 57 DOI: 10.1007/s11434-012-5486-3 |access-date=2013-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215034626/http://csb.scichina.com:8080/kxtbe/EN/10.1007/s11434-012-5486-3 |archive-date=2013-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2014, the Oro Verde Observatory of [[Argentina]] reported ten or more gigantic jet events observed over a thunderstorm in [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]] south. The storm center was located at 33°S, 60°W, near the city of [[Rosario]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

On August 13, 2016, photographer Phebe Pan caught a clear wide-angle photo of a gigantic jet on a wide-angle lens while shooting [[Perseid meteors]] atop Shi Keng Kong peak in [[Guangdong Province|Guangdong province]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&amp;day=16&amp;month=08&amp;year=2016|title=Spaceweather.com Time Machine|website=spaceweather.com|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Li Hualong captured the same jet from a more distant location in Jiahe, Hunan, China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spaceweathergallery.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=128464]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2017, Photographer Jeff Miles captured four gigantic jets over Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|URL=https://watchers.news/2017/03/31/gigantic-jets-over-pilbara-australia-on-march-28-2017/ |title=Gigantic jets over Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ELVES==
'''ELVES''' ([[Emission spectrum|Emission of Light]] and [[Very Low Frequency]] perturbations due to [[Electromagnetic Pulse]] Sources) often appear as a dim, flattened, expanding glow around {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter that lasts for, typically, just one [[millisecond]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alum.mit.edu/www/cpbl/elves ELVES, a primer: Ionospheric Heating By the Electromagnetic Pulses from Lightning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They occur in the [[ionosphere]] {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[sea level|above the ground]] over [[thunderstorm]]s. Their color was a puzzle for some time, but is now believed to be a red hue. ''ELVES'' were first recorded on another shuttle mission, this time recorded off [[French Guiana]] on October 7, 1990.&lt;ref name="space shuttle"/&gt;  That ELVES was discovered in the Shuttle Video by the Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE) team at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], AL led by the Principal Investigator, Otha H."Skeet" Vaughan, Jr.

ELVES is a whimsical [[acronym]] for '''E'''missions of '''L'''ight and '''V'''ery Low Frequency [[wikt:Perturbations|Perturbations]] due to '''E'''lectromagnetic Pulse '''S'''ources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/elves The Free Dictionary – ELVES]&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the process by which the light is generated; the excitation of [[nitrogen]] molecules due to [[electron]] collisions (the electrons possibly having been energized by the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pulse caused by a discharge from an underlying thunderstorm).

A '''wave function''' in [[quantum physics]] is a mathematical description of the [[quantum state]] of an isolated [[quantum system]].  The wave function is a  [[complex number|complex-valued]] [[probability amplitude]], and the probabilities for the possible results of measurements made on the system can be derived from it.  The most common symbols for a wave function are the Greek letters {{math|''ψ''}} or {{math|Ψ}} (lower-case and capital [[psi (letter)|psi]], respectively).

The wave function is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] corresponding to some maximal set of [[Canonical commutation relations|commuting]] [[observables]].  Once such a representation is chosen, the wave function can be derived from the quantum state.

For a given system, the choice of which commuting degrees of freedom to use is not unique, and correspondingly the [[domain of a function|domain]] of the wave function is also not unique.  For instance, it may be taken to be a function of all the position coordinates of the particles over position space, or the momenta of all the particles over [[momentum space]]; the two are related by a [[Fourier transform]].  Some particles, like [[electron]]s and [[photon]]s, have nonzero [[spin (physics)|spin]], and the wave function for such particles includes spin as an intrinsic, discrete degree of freedom; other discrete variables can also be included, such as [[isospin]].  When a system has internal degrees of freedom, the wave function at each point in the continuous degrees of freedom (e.g., a point in space) assigns a complex number for ''each'' possible value of the discrete degrees of freedom (e.g., z-component of spin) – these values are often displayed in a [[column matrix]] (e.g., a {{math|2 × 1}} column vector for a non-relativistic electron with spin {{math|{{frac|1|2}}}}).

According to the [[superposition principle]] of quantum mechanics, wave functions can be added together and multiplied by complex numbers to form new wave functions and form a [[Hilbert space]].  The inner product between two wave functions is a measure of the overlap between the corresponding physical states, and is used in the foundational probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, the [[Born rule]], relating transition probabilities to inner products.  The Schrödinger equation determines how wave functions evolve over time, and a wave function behaves qualitatively like other [[wave]]s, such as [[water wave]]s or waves on a string, because the Schrödinger equation is mathematically a type of [[wave equation]].  This explains the name "wave function," and gives rise to [[wave–particle duality]].  However, the wave function in quantum mechanics describes a kind of physical phenomenon, still open to different [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]], which fundamentally differs from that of classic mechanical waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Born|1927|pp=354–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1958|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927/1985/2009). Heisenberg is translated by {{harvnb|Camilleri|2009|p=71}}, (from {{harvnb|Bohr|1985|p=142}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murdoch|1987|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Broglie|1960|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newton|2002|pp=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The integral of this quantity, over all the system's degrees of freedom, must be 1 in accordance with the probability interpretation.  This general requirement that a wave function must satisfy is called the ''normalization condition''.  Since the wave function is complex valued, only its relative phase and relative magnitude can be measured—its value does not, in isolation, tell anything about the magnitudes or directions of measurable observables; one has to apply [[Operator (quantum mechanics)|quantum operator]]s, whose eigenvalues correspond to sets of possible results of measurements, to the wave function {{math|''ψ''}} and calculate the statistical distributions for measurable quantities.

==Historical background==

{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}

In 1905, [[Einstein]] postulated the proportionality between the frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of a photon and its energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E = hf&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1905|pp=132–148}} (in German), {{harvnb|Arons|Peppard|1965|p=367}} (in English)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1916 the corresponding relation between photon's [[momentum]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \dfrac{h}{p}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1916|pp=47–62}}, and a nearly identical version {{harvnb|Einstein|1917|pp=121–128}} translated in {{harvnb|ter Haar|1967|pages=167–183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]]. In 1923, De Broglie was the first to suggest that the relation &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{p}&lt;/math&gt;, now called the [[matter wave|De Broglie relation]], holds for ''massive'' particles, the chief clue being [[Lorentz invariance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Broglie|1923|pp=507–510,548,630}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this can be viewed as the starting point for the modern development of quantum mechanics. The equations represent [[wave–particle duality]] for both massless and massive particles.

In the 1920s and 1930s, quantum mechanics was developed using [[calculus]] and [[linear algebra]]. Those who used the techniques of calculus included [[Louis-Victor de Broglie|Louis de Broglie]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], and others, developing "[[wave|wave mechanics]]". Those who applied the methods of linear algebra included [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Born]], and others, developing "matrix mechanics". Schrödinger subsequently showed that the two approaches were equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanle|1977|pp=606–609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Schrödinger published the famous wave equation now named after him, indeed the [[Schrödinger equation]], based on [[Classical physics|classical]] [[conservation of energy]] using [[operator (physics)|quantum operators]] and the de Broglie relations such that the solutions of the equation are the wave functions for the quantum system.&lt;ref name="Schrödinger_1926"&gt;{{harvnb|Schrödinger|1926|pages=1049–1070}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no one was clear on how to ''interpret it''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tipler|Mosca|Freeman|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Schrödinger and others thought that wave functions represent particles that are spread out with most of the particle being where the wave function is large.&lt;ref name=Weinberg_2013&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was shown to be incompatible with the elastic scattering of a wave packet (representing a particle) off a target; it spreads out in all directions.&lt;ref name=Born_1926_A&gt;{{harvnb|Born|1926a}}, translated in {{harvnb|Wheeler|Zurek|1983}} at pages 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; While a scattered particle may scatter in any direction, it does not break up and take off in all directions. In 1926, Born provided the perspective of [[probability amplitude]].&lt;ref name=Born_1926_A/&gt;&lt;ref name="Born_1926_B"&gt;{{harvnb|Born|1926b}}, translated in {{harvnb|Ludwig|1968|pages=206–225}}. Also [http://www.ymambrini.com/My_World/History_files/Born_1.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|Freedman|2008|page=1333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relates calculations of quantum mechanics directly to probabilistic experimental observations.
It is accepted as part of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. There are many other [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]. In 1927, [[Douglas Hartree|Hartree]] and [[Vladimir Fock|Fock]] made the first step in an attempt to solve the [[Many-body problem|''N''-body]] wave function, and developed the ''self-consistency cycle'': an [[Iteration|iterative]] [[algorithm]] to approximate the solution. Now it is also known as the [[Hartree–Fock method]].&lt;ref name="Quanta 1974"&gt;{{harvnb|Atkins|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Slater determinant]] and [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] (of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]) was part of the method, provided by [[John C. Slater]].

Schrödinger did encounter an equation for the wave function that satisfied [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] energy conservation ''before'' he published the non-relativistic one, but discarded it as it predicted negative [[probability|probabilities]] and negative [[energy|energies]]. In 1927, [[Oskar Klein|Klein]], [[Walter Gordon (physicist)|Gordon]] and Fock also found it, but incorporated the [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]] [[interaction]] and proved that it was [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]]. De Broglie also arrived at the same equation in 1928. This relativistic wave equation is now most commonly known as the [[Klein–Gordon equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|Shaw|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] phenomenologically found a non-relativistic equation to describe spin-1/2 particles in electromagnetic fields, now called the [[Pauli equation]].&lt;ref name=Pauli_1927&gt;{{harvnb|Pauli|1927|pages=601–623.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauli found the wave function was not described by a single complex function of space and time, but needed two complex numbers, which respectively correspond to the spin +1/2 and −1/2 states of the fermion. Soon after in 1928, [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] found an equation from the first successful unification of [[special relativity]] and quantum mechanics applied to the [[electron]], now called the [[Dirac equation]]. In this, the wave function is a [[Dirac spinor|''spinor'']] represented by four complex-valued components:&lt;ref name="Quanta 1974"/&gt; two for the electron and two for the electron's [[antiparticle]], the [[positron]]. In the non-relativistic limit, the Dirac wave function resembles the Pauli wave function for the electron. Later, other [[relativistic wave equations]] were found.

===Wave functions and wave equations in modern theories===
All these wave equations are of enduring importance. The Schrödinger equation and the Pauli equation are under many circumstances excellent approximations of the relativistic variants. They are considerably easier to solve in practical problems than the relativistic counterparts.

The [[Klein–Gordon equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]], while being relativistic, do not represent full reconciliation of quantum mechanics and special relativity. The branch of quantum mechanics where these equations are studied the same way as the Schrödinger equation, often called [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], while very successful, has its limitations (see e.g. [[Lamb shift]]) and conceptual problems (see e.g. [[Dirac sea]]).

Relativity makes it inevitable that the number of particles in a system is not constant. For full reconciliation, [[quantum field theory]] is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Weinberg|2002}} takes the standpoint that quantum field theory appears the way it does because it is the ''only'' way to reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity.&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, the wave equations and the wave functions have their place, but in a somewhat different guise. The main objects of interest are not the wave functions, but rather operators, so called ''field operators'' (or just fields where "operator" is understood) on the Hilbert space of states (to be described next section). It turns out that the original relativistic wave equations and their solutions are still needed to build the Hilbert space. Moreover, the ''free fields operators'', i.e. when interactions are assumed not to exist, turn out to (formally) satisfy the same equation as do the fields (wave functions) in many cases.

Thus the Klein–Gordon equation (spin {{math|0}}) and the Dirac equation (spin {{math|{{frac|1|2}}}}) in this guise remain in the theory. Higher spin analogues include the [[Proca equation]] (spin {{math|1}}), [[Rarita–Schwinger equation]] (spin {{math|{{frac|3|2}}}}), and, more generally, the [[Bargmann–Wigner equations]]. For ''massless'' free fields two examples are the free field [[Maxwell equation]] (spin {{math|1}}) and the free field [[Einstein equation]] (spin {{math|2}}) for the field operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Weinberg|2002}} See especially chapter 5, where some of these results are derived.&lt;/ref&gt; All of them are essentially a direct consequence of the requirement of [[Lorentz invariance]]. Their solutions must transform under Lorentz transformation in a prescribed way, i.e. under a particular [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group#Common representations|representation of the Lorentz group]] and that together with few other reasonable demands, e.g. the ''cluster decomposition principle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002}} Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; with implications for [[causality]] is enough to fix the equations.

It should be emphasized that this applies to free field equations; interactions are not included. If a Lagrangian density (including interactions) is available, then the Lagrangian formalism will yield an equation of motion at the classical level. This equation may be very complex and not amenable to solution. Any solution would refer to a ''fixed'' number of particles and would not account for the term "interaction" as referred to in these theories, which involves the creation and annihilation of particles and not external potentials as in ordinary "first quantized" quantum theory.

In [[string theory]], the situation remains analogous. For instance, a wave function in momentum space has the role of Fourier expansion coefficient in a general state of a particle (string) with momentum that is not sharply defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zwiebach|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For now, consider the simple case of a non-relativistic single particle, without [[spin (physics)|spin]], in one spatial dimension. More general cases are discussed below.

=== Position-space wave functions ===

The state of such a particle is completely described by its wave function,

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''x''}} is position and {{math|''t''}} is time. This is a [[complex-valued function]] of two real variables {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''t''}}.

For one spinless particle in 1d, if the wave function is interpreted as a [[probability amplitude]], the square [[absolute value|modulus]] of the wave function, the positive real number

:&lt;math&gt; \left|\Psi(x, t)\right|^2 = {\Psi(x, t)}^{*}\Psi(x, t) = \rho(x, t), &lt;/math&gt;

is interpreted as the [[probability density function|probability density]] that the particle is at {{math|''x''}}. The asterisk indicates the [[complex conjugate]]. If the particle's position is [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measured]], its location cannot be determined from the wave function, but is described by a [[probability distribution]]. The probability that its position {{math|''x''}} will be in the interval {{math|''a'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''b''}} is the integral of the density over this interval:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{a\le x\le b} (t) = \int\limits_a^b d x\,|\Psi(x,t)|^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''t''}} is the time at which the particle was measured. This leads to the '''normalization condition''':

:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty d x \, |\Psi(x,t)|^2  = 1\,,&lt;/math&gt;

because if the particle is measured, there is 100% probability that it will be ''somewhere''.

For a given system, the set of all possible normalizable wave functions (at any given time) forms an abstract mathematical [[vector space]], meaning that it is possible to add together different wave functions, and multiply wave functions by complex numbers (see [[vector space]] for details). Technically, because of the normalization condition, wave functions form a [[projective space]] rather than an ordinary vector space. This vector space is infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]], because there is no finite set of functions which can be added together in various combinations to create every possible function. Also, it is a [[Hilbert space]], because the [[inner product]] of two wave functions {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be defined as the complex number (at time {{math|''t''}})&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The functions are here assumed to be elements of [[Lp-space|{{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], the space of square integrable functions. The elements of this space are more precisely equivalence classes of square integrable functions, two functions declared equivalent if they differ on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] {{math|0}}. This is necessary to obtain an inner product (that is, {{math|(Ψ, Ψ) {{=}} 0 ⇒ Ψ ≡ 0}}) as opposed to a '''semi-inner product'''. The integral is taken to be the [[Lebesque integral]]. This is essential for completeness of the space, thus yielding a complete inner product space = Hilbert space.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;( \Psi_1 , \Psi_2 ) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty d x \, \Psi_1^*(x, t)\Psi_2(x, t).&lt;/math&gt;

More details are given [[Wave function#Wave functions and function spaces|below]]. Although the inner product of two wave functions is a complex number, the inner product of a wave function {{math|Ψ}} with itself,

:&lt;math&gt;(\Psi,\Psi) = \|\Psi\|^2 \,, &lt;/math&gt;

is ''always'' a positive real number. The number {{math|{{!}}{{!}}Ψ{{!}}{{!}}}} (not {{math|{{!}}{{!}}Ψ{{!}}{{!}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is called the '''[[norm (mathematics)|norm]]''' of the wave function {{math|Ψ}}.

If {{math|(Ψ, Ψ) {{=}} 1}}, then {{math|Ψ}} is normalized. If {{math|Ψ}} is not normalized, then dividing by its norm gives the normalized function {{math|Ψ/{{!}}{{!}}Ψ{{!}}{{!}}}}. Two wave functions {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] if {{math|(Ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} 0}}. If they are normalized ''and'' orthogonal, they are [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]]. Orthogonality (hence also orthonormality) of wave functions is not a necessary condition wave functions must satisfy, but is instructive to consider since this guarantees [[linear independence]] of the functions. In a linear combination of orthogonal wave functions {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} we have,

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = \sum_n a_n \Psi_n \,,\quad a_n = \frac{( \Psi_n , \Psi )}{( \Psi_n , \Psi_n )} &lt;/math&gt;

If the wave functions {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} were nonorthogonal, the coefficients would be less simple to obtain.

In the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], the modulus squared of the inner product (a complex number) gives a real number

:&lt;math&gt;\left|(\Psi_1,\Psi_2)\right|^2 = P\left(\Psi_2 \rightarrow \Psi_1\right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which, assuming both wave functions are normalized, is interpreted as the probability of the wave function {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} [[wave function collapse|"collapsing"]] to the new wave function {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} upon measurement of an observable, whose eigenvalues are the possible results of the measurement, with {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} being an eigenvector of the resulting eigenvalue. This is the [[Born rule]],&lt;ref name=Born_1926_A /&gt; and is one of the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics.

At a particular instant of time, all values of the wave function {{math|Ψ(''x'', ''t'')}} are components of a vector. There are uncountably infinitely many of them and integration is used in place of summation. In [[Bra–ket notation]], this vector is written

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi(t)\rangle = \int dx \Psi(x,t) |x\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

and is referred to as a "quantum state vector", or simply "quantum state". There are several advantages to understanding wave functions as representing elements of an abstract vector space:
*All the powerful tools of [[linear algebra]] can be used to manipulate and understand wave functions. For example:
**Linear algebra explains how a vector space can be given a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]], and then any vector in the vector space can be expressed in this basis. This explains the relationship between a wave function in position space and a wave function in momentum space and suggests that there are other possibilities too.
**[[Bra–ket notation]] can be used to manipulate wave functions.
*The idea that [[quantum state]]s are vectors in an abstract vector space is completely general in all aspects of quantum mechanics and [[quantum field theory]], whereas the idea that quantum states are complex-valued "wave" functions of space is only true in certain situations.

The time parameter is often suppressed, and will be in the following. The {{math|''x''}} coordinate is a continuous index. The {{math|{{ket|''x''}}}} are the basis vectors, which are [[orthonormal]] so their [[Bra–ket notation#Inner products and bras|inner product]] is a [[delta function]];

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x' | x \rangle = \delta(x' - x) &lt;/math&gt;

thus

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x' |\Psi\rangle = \int dx \Psi(x) \langle x'|x\rangle = \Psi(x') &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle = \int dx  |x\rangle \langle x |\Psi\rangle = \left( \int dx |x\rangle \langle x |\right) |\Psi\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

which illuminates the [[identity operator]]

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int dx |x\rangle \langle x | \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Finding the identity operator in a basis allows the abstract state to be expressed explicitly in a basis, and more (the inner product between two state vectors, and other operators for observables, can be expressed in the basis).

=== Momentum-space wave functions ===

The particle also has a wave function in [[momentum space]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(p,t)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''p''}} is the [[momentum]] in one dimension, which can be any value from {{math|−∞}} to {{math|+∞}}, and {{math|''t''}} is time.

Analogous to the position case, the inner product of two wave functions {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'', ''t'')}} and {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'', ''t'')}} can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;(\Phi_1 , \Phi_2 ) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty d p \, \Phi_1^*(p, t)\Phi_2(p, t) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One particular solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation is
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_p(x) = e^{ipx/\hbar},&lt;/math&gt;
a [[plane wave]], which can be used in the description of a particle with momentum exactly {{math|''p''}}, since it is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator. These functions are not normalizable to unity (they aren't square-integrable), so they are not really elements of physical Hilbert space. The set
:&lt;math&gt;\{\Psi_p(x, t), -\infty \le p \le \infty\}&lt;/math&gt;
forms what is called the '''momentum basis'''. This "basis" is not a basis in the usual mathematical sense. For one thing, since the functions aren't normalizable, they are instead '''normalized to a delta function''',
:&lt;math&gt;(\Psi_{p},\Psi_{p'}) = \delta(p - p').&lt;/math&gt;
For another thing, though they are linearly independent, there are too many of them (they form an uncountable set) for a basis for physical Hilbert space. They can still be used to express all functions in it using Fourier transforms as described next.

=== Relations between position and momentum representations ===

The {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''}} representations are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
|\Psi\rangle = I|\Psi\rangle &amp;= \int |x\rangle \langle x|\Psi\rangle dx = \int \Psi(x) |x\rangle dx,\\
|\Psi\rangle = I|\Psi\rangle &amp;= \int |p\rangle \langle p|\Psi\rangle dp = \int \Phi(p) |p\rangle dp.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now take the projection of the state {{math|Ψ}} onto eigenfunctions of momentum using the last expression in the two equations,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shankar|1994|loc=Ch. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \Psi(x) \langle p|x\rangle dx = \int \Phi(p') \langle p|p'\rangle dp' = \int \Phi(p') \delta(p-p') dp' = \Phi(p).&lt;/math&gt;

Then utilizing the known expression for suitably normalized eigenstates of momentum in the position representation solutions of the free Schrödinger equation

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x | p \rangle = p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}}e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}px} \Rightarrow \langle p | x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}}e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}px},&lt;/math&gt;

one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}}\int \Psi(x)e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}px}dx\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, using eigenfunctions of position,

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}}\int \Phi(p)e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}px}dp\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The position-space and momentum-space wave functions are thus found to be [[Fourier transform]]s of each other.&lt;ref name=Griffiths_1&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two wave functions contain the same information, and either one alone is sufficient to calculate any property of the particle. As representatives of elements of abstract physical Hilbert space, whose elements are the possible states of the system under consideration, they represent the same state vector, hence ''identical physical states'', but they are not generally equal when viewed as square-integrable functions.

In practice, the position-space wave function is used much more often than the momentum-space wave function. The potential entering the relevant equation (Schrödinger, Dirac, etc.) determines in which basis the description is easiest. For the [[harmonic oscillator]], {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''}} enter symmetrically, so there it doesn't matter which description one uses. The same equation (modulo constants) results. From this follows, with a little bit of afterthought, a factoid: The solutions to the wave equation of the harmonic oscillator are eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform in {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The Fourier transform viewed as a unitary operator on the space {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} has eigenvalues {{math|±1, ±''i''}}. The eigenvectors are "Hermite functions", i.e. [[Hermite polynomials]] multiplied by a [[Gaussian function]]. See {{harvtxt|Byron|Fuller|1992}} for a description of the Fourier transform as a unitary transformation. For eigenvalues and eigenvalues, refer to Problem 27 Ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions (other cases) ==

Following are the general forms of the wave function for systems in higher dimensions and more particles, as well as including other degrees of freedom than position coordinates or momentum components.

=== One-particle states in 3d position space ===

The position-space wave function of a single particle without spin in three spatial dimensions is similar to the case of one spatial dimension above:
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''r'''}} is the [[position vector]] in three-dimensional space, and {{math|''t''}} is time. As always {{math|Ψ('''r''', ''t'')}} is a complex-valued function of real variables. As a single vector in Dirac notation

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi(t)\rangle = \int d^3\! \mathbf{r}\, \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) \,|\mathbf{r}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

All the previous remarks on inner products, momentum space wave functions, Fourier transforms, and so on extend to higher dimensions.

For a particle with [[spin (physics)|spin]], ignoring the position degrees of freedom, the wave function is a function of spin only (time is a parameter);

:&lt;math&gt;\xi(s_z,t)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[spin (physics)|spin projection quantum number]] along the {{math|''z''}} axis. (The {{math|''z''}} axis is an arbitrary choice; other axes can be used instead if the wave function is transformed appropriately, see below.) The {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} parameter, unlike {{math|'''r'''}} and {{math|''t''}}, is a ''discrete variable''. For example, for a [[spin-1/2]] particle, {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} can only be {{math|+1/2}} or {{math|−1/2}}, and not any other value. (In general, for spin {{math|''s''}}, {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} can be {{math|''s'', ''s'' − 1, ... , −''s'' + 1, −''s''}}). Inserting each quantum number gives a complex valued function of space and time, there are {{math|2''s'' + 1}} of them. These can be arranged into a [[column vector]]&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Column vectors can be motivated by the convenience of expressing the [[spin operator]] for a given spin as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], for the z-component spin operator (divided by hbar to nondimensionalize)

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\hbar}\hat{S}_z = \begin{bmatrix} s &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; s-1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; -(s-1) &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -s \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[eigenvector]]s of this matrix are the above column vectors, with eigenvalues being the corresponding spin quantum numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{ \xi = \begin{bmatrix} \xi(s,t) \\ \xi(s-1,t) \\ \vdots \\ \xi(-(s-1),t) \\ \xi(-s,t) \\ \end{bmatrix} = \xi(s,t) \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} + \xi(s-1,t)\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} + \cdots + \xi(-(s-1),t) \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} + \xi(-s,t) \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} } &lt;/math&gt;

In [[bra–ket notation]], these easily arrange into the components of a vector&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Each {{math|{{ket|''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}} is usually identified as a column vector

:&lt;math&gt;|s\rangle \leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} \,, \quad |s-1\rangle \leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} \,, \ldots \,, \quad |-(s-1)\rangle \leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} \,,\quad |-s\rangle \leftrightarrow  \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

but it is a common abuse of notation to write

:&lt;math&gt;|s\rangle  =  \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} \, \ldots \,, &lt;/math&gt;

because the kets {{math|{{ket|''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}} are not synonymous or equal to the column vectors. Column vectors simply provide a convenient way to express the spin components.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|\xi (t)\rangle = \sum_{s_z=-s}^s \xi(s_z,t) \,| s_z \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

The entire vector {{math|''ξ''}} is a solution of the Schrödinger equation (with a suitable Hamiltonian), which unfolds to a coupled system of {{math|2''s'' + 1}} ordinary differential equations with solutions {{math|''ξ''(''s'', ''t''), ''ξ''(''s'' − 1, ''t''), ..., ''ξ''(−''s'', ''t'')}}. The term "spin function" instead of "wave function" is used by some authors. This contrasts the solutions to position space wave functions, the position coordinates being continuous degrees of freedom, because then the Schrödinger equation does take the form of a wave equation.

More generally, for a particle in 3d with any spin, the wave function can be written in "position–spin space" as:
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r},s_z,t)&lt;/math&gt;
and these can also be arranged into a column vector

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \begin{bmatrix} \Psi(\mathbf{r},s,t) \\ \Psi(\mathbf{r},s-1,t) \\ \vdots \\ \Psi(\mathbf{r},-(s-1),t) \\ \Psi(\mathbf{r},-s,t) \\ \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

in which the spin dependence is placed in indexing the entries, and the wave function is a complex vector-valued function of space and time only.

All values of the wave function, not only for discrete but continuous variables also, collect into a single vector

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi(t)\rangle 
=
\sum_{s_z}\int d^3\!\mathbf{r} \,\Psi(\mathbf{r},s_z,t)\, |\mathbf{r}, s_z\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

For a single particle, the [[Bra–ket notation#Composite bras and kets|tensor product]] {{math|&amp;otimes;}} of its position state vector {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} and spin state vector {{math|{{ket|''ξ''}}}} gives the composite position-spin state vector

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi(t)\rangle\! \otimes\! |\xi(t)\rangle 
= 
\sum_{s_z}\int d^3\! \mathbf{r}\, \psi(\mathbf{r},t)\,\xi(s_z,t) \,|\mathbf{r}\rangle \!\otimes\! |s_z\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

with the identifications

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi (t)\rangle = |\psi(t)\rangle 
\!\otimes\!
 |\xi(t)\rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r},s_z,t) = \psi(\mathbf{r},t)\,\xi(s_z,t) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{r},s_z \rangle= |\mathbf{r}\rangle \!\otimes\! |s_z\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

The tensor product factorization is only possible if the orbital and spin angular momenta of the particle are separable in the [[Hamiltonian operator]] underlying the system's dynamics (in other words, the Hamiltonian can be split into the sum of orbital and spin terms&lt;ref name=Shankar&gt;{{harvnb|Shankar|1994|page=378–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The time dependence can be placed in either factor, and time evolution of each can be studied separately. The factorization is not possible for those interactions where an external field or any space-dependent quantity couples to the spin; examples include a particle in a [[magnetic field]], and [[spin–orbit coupling]].

The preceding discussion is not limited to spin as a discrete variable, the total [[angular momentum operator|angular momentum]] ''J'' may also be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other discrete degrees of freedom, like [[isospin]], can expressed similarly to the case of spin above.

===Many-particle states in 3d position space===

[[File:Two particle wavefunction.svg|right|402px|thumb|Traveling waves of two free particles, with two of three dimensions suppressed. Top is position-space wave function, bottom is momentum-space wave function, with corresponding probability densities.]]

If there are many particles, in general there is only one wave function, not a separate wave function for each particle. The fact that ''one'' wave function describes ''many'' particles is what makes [[quantum entanglement]] and the [[EPR paradox]] possible. The position-space wave function for {{math|''N''}} particles is written:&lt;ref name="Quanta 1974"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2 \cdots \mathbf{r}_N,t)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the position of the {{math|''i''}}th particle in three-dimensional space, and {{math|''t''}} is time. Altogether, this is a complex-valued function of {{math|3''N'' + 1}} real variables.

In quantum mechanics there is a fundamental distinction between ''[[identical particles]]'' and ''distinguishable'' particles. For example, any two electrons are identical and fundamentally indistinguishable from each other; the laws of physics make it impossible to "stamp an identification number" on a certain electron to keep track of it.&lt;ref name=Griffiths_1/&gt; This translates to a requirement on the wave function for a system of identical particles:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi \left ( \ldots \mathbf{r}_a, \ldots , \mathbf{r}_b, \ldots \right ) = \pm \Psi \left ( \ldots \mathbf{r}_b, \ldots , \mathbf{r}_a, \ldots \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|+}} sign occurs if the particles are ''all bosons'' and {{math|−}} sign if they are ''all fermions''. In other words, the wave function is either totally symmetric in the positions of bosons, or totally antisymmetric in the positions of fermions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zettili|2009|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical interchange of particles corresponds to mathematically switching arguments in the wave function. The antisymmetry feature of fermionic wave functions leads to the [[Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli principle]]. Generally, bosonic and fermionic symmetry requirements are the manifestation of [[particle statistics]] and are present in other quantum state formalisms.

For {{math|''N''}} ''distinguishable'' particles (no two being [[identical particles|identical]], i.e. no two having the same set of quantum numbers), there is no requirement for the wave function to be either symmetric or antisymmetric.

For a collection of particles, some identical with coordinates {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} and others distinguishable {{math|'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} (not identical with each other, and not identical to the aforementioned identical particles), the wave function is symmetric or antisymmetric in the identical particle coordinates {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} only:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi \left ( \ldots \mathbf{r}_a, \ldots , \mathbf{r}_b, \ldots , \mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots \right ) = \pm \Psi \left ( \ldots \mathbf{r}_b, \ldots , \mathbf{r}_a, \ldots , \mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Again, there is no symmetry requirement for the distinguishable particle coordinates {{math|'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The wave function for ''N'' particles each with spin is the complex-valued function

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2 \cdots \mathbf{r}_N, s_{z\,1}, s_{z\,2} \cdots s_{z\,N}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

Accumulating all these components into a single vector,

&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{| \Psi \rangle}_{\text{state vector (ket)}} = \underbrace{\overbrace{\sum_{s_{z\,1},\ldots,s_{z\,N}}}^{\text{discrete labels}} \overbrace{\int\limits\limits_{R_N} d^3\mathbf{r}_N \cdots \int\limits\limits_{R_1} d^3\mathbf{r}_1}^{\text{continuous labels}}}_{\text{adding up}} \, \underbrace{{\Psi}( \mathbf{r}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_N , s_{z\,1} , \ldots , s_{z\,N} )}_{\text{wave function (component of state vector along basis state)}} \underbrace{| \mathbf{r}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_N , s_{z\,1} , \ldots , s_{z\,N} \rangle }_{\text{basis state (basis ket)}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For identical particles, symmetry requirements apply to both position and spin arguments of the wave function so it has the overall correct symmetry.

The formulae for the inner products are integrals over all coordinates or momenta and sums over all spin quantum numbers. For the general case of {{math|''N''}} particles with spin in 3d,

:&lt;math&gt; ( \Psi_1 , \Psi_2 ) = \sum_{s_{z\,N}} \cdots \sum_{s_{z\,2}} \sum_{s_{z\,1}} \int\limits_{\mathrm{ all \, space}} d ^3\mathbf{r}_1 \int\limits_{\mathrm{ all \, space}} d ^3\mathbf{r}_2\cdots \int\limits_{\mathrm{ all \, space}} d ^3 \mathbf{r}_N \Psi^{*}_1 \left(\mathbf{r}_1 \cdots \mathbf{r}_N,s_{z\,1}\cdots s_{z\,N},t \right )\Psi_2 \left(\mathbf{r}_1 \cdots \mathbf{r}_N,s_{z\,1}\cdots s_{z\,N},t \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

this is altogether {{math|''N''}} three-dimensional [[volume integral]]s and {{math|''N''}} sums over the spins. The differential volume elements {{math|''d''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also written "{{math|''dV''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}" or "{{math|''dx&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dy&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dz&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}".

The multidimensional Fourier transforms of the position or position–spin space wave functions yields momentum or momentum–spin space wave functions.

====Probability interpretation====

For the general case of {{math|''N''}} particles with spin in 3d, if {{math|Ψ}} is interpreted as a probability amplitude, the probability density is

:&lt;math&gt;\rho\left(\mathbf{r}_1 \cdots \mathbf{r}_N,s_{z\,1}\cdots s_{z\,N},t \right ) =  \left | \Psi\left (\mathbf{r}_1 \cdots \mathbf{r}_N,s_{z\,1}\cdots s_{z\,N},t \right ) \right |^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the probability that particle 1 is in region {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} with spin {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;''z''1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} ''and'' particle 2 is in region {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} with spin {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;''z''2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} etc. at time {{math|''t''}} is the integral of the probability density over these regions and evaluated at these spin numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathbf{r}_1\in R_1,s_{z\,1} = m_1, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_N\in R_N,s_{z\,N} = m_N} (t) = \int\limits_{R_1} d ^3\mathbf{r}_1 \int\limits_{R_2} d ^3\mathbf{r}_2\cdots \int\limits_{R_N} d ^3\mathbf{r}_N \left | \Psi\left (\mathbf{r}_1 \cdots \mathbf{r}_N,m_1\cdots m_N,t \right ) \right |^2&lt;/math&gt;

== Time dependence ==

{{main article|Dynamical pictures}}

For systems in time-independent potentials, the wave function can always be written as a function of the degrees of freedom multiplied by a time-dependent phase factor, the form of which is given by the Schrödinger equation. For {{math|''N''}} particles, considering their positions only and suppressing other degrees of freedom,

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{r}_N,t) = e^{-i Et/\hbar} \,\psi(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{r}_N)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the energy eigenvalue of the system corresponding to the eigenstate {{math|Ψ}}. Wave functions of this form are called [[stationary state]]s.

The time dependence of the quantum state and the operators can be placed according to unitary transformations on the operators and states. For any quantum state {{math|{{ket|Ψ}}}} and operator {{math|''O''}}, in the Schrödinger picture {{math|{{ket|Ψ(''t'')}}}} changes with time according to the Schrödinger equation while {{math|''O''}} is constant. In the Heisenberg picture it is the other way round, {{math|{{ket|Ψ}}}} is constant while {{math|''O''(''t'')}} evolves with time according to the Heisenberg equation of motion. The Dirac (or interaction) picture is intermediate, time dependence is places in both operators and states which evolve according to equations of motion. It is useful primarily in computing [[S-matrix|S-matrix elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2002}} Chapter 3, Scattering matrix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-relativistic examples==

The following are solutions to the Schrödinger equation for one nonrelativistic spinless particle.

===Finite potential barrier===

[[Image:Finitepot.png|thumb|right|Scattering at a finite potential barrier of height {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The amplitudes and direction of left and right moving waves are indicated. In red, those waves used for the derivation of the reflection and transmission amplitude. {{math|''E'' &gt; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} for this illustration.]]

One of most prominent features of the wave mechanics is a possibility for a particle to reach a location with a prohibitive (in classical mechanics) [[potential energy|force potential]]. A common model is the "[[potential barrier]]", the one-dimensional case has the potential

:&lt;math&gt;V(x)=\begin{cases}V_0 &amp; |x|&lt;a \\ 0 &amp; | x | \geq L\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and the steady-state solutions to the wave equation have the form (for some constants {{math|''k'', ''κ''}})

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi (x) = \begin{cases}
A_{\mathrm{r}}e^{ikx}+A_{\mathrm{l}}e^{-ikx} &amp; x&lt;-a, \\ 
B_{\mathrm{r}}e^{\kappa x}+B_{\mathrm{l}}e^{-\kappa x} &amp; |x|\le a, \\ 
C_{\mathrm{r}}e^{ikx}+C_{\mathrm{l}}e^{-ikx} &amp; x&gt;a.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that these wave functions are not normalized; see [[scattering theory]] for discussion.

The standard interpretation of this is as a stream of particles being fired at the step from the left (the direction of negative {{math|''x''}}): setting {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} corresponds to firing particles singly; the terms containing {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} signify motion to the right, while {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;}} – to the left. Under this beam interpretation, put {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} since no particles are coming from the right. By applying the continuity of wave functions and their derivatives at the boundaries, it is hence possible to determine the constants above.

[[File:Quantum dot.png|thumb|330px|right|3D confined electron wave functions in a quantum dot. Here, rectangular and triangular-shaped quantum dots are shown. Energy states in rectangular dots are more ''s-type'' and ''p-type''. However, in a triangular dot the wave functions are mixed due to confinement symmetry. (Click for animation)|link=File:QuantumDot_wf.gif]]

In a semiconductor [[crystallite]] whose radius is smaller than the size of its [[exciton]] [[Bohr radius]], the excitons are squeezed, leading to [[Potential well#Quantum confinement|quantum confinement]]. The energy levels can then be modeled using the [[particle in a box]] model in which the energy of different states is dependent on the length of the box.

===Quantum harmonic oscillator===

The wave functions for the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] can be expressed in terms of [[Hermite polynomial]]s {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, they are

:&lt;math&gt;  \Psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2^n\,n!}} \cdot \left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \cdot e^{
- \frac{m\omega x^2}{2 \hbar}} \cdot H_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}} x \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0,1,2,...}}.

===Hydrogen atom===

[[Image:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|400px|The electron probability density for the first few [[hydrogen atom]] electron [[atomic orbital|orbital]]s shown as cross-sections. These orbitals form an [[orthonormal basis]] for the wave function of the electron. Different orbitals are depicted with different scale.]]

The wave functions of an electron in a [[Hydrogen atom#Mathematical summary of eigenstates of hydrogen atom|Hydrogen atom]] are expressed in terms of [[spherical harmonics]] and [[Laguerre polynomial#Generalized Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomials]] (these are defined differently by different authors—see main article on them and the hydrogen atom).

It is convenient to use spherical coordinates, and the wave function can be separated into functions of each coordinate,&lt;ref&gt;Physics for Scientists and Engineers – with Modern Physics (6th Edition), P. A. Tipler, G. Mosca, Freeman, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7167-8964-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi_{n\ell m}(r,\theta,\phi) 
=

where {{math|''R''}} are radial functions and {{math|''Y''{{su|p=''m''|b=''ℓ''}}(''θ'', ''φ'')}} are [[spherical harmonic]]s of degree {{math|''ℓ''}} and order {{math|''m''}}. This is the only atom for which the Schrödinger equation has been solved exactly. Multi-electron atoms require approximative methods. The family of solutions is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Griffiths|title=Introduction to elementary particles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9Dz56myXm8C&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=27 June 2011|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-40601-2|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 4''πε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[Bohr radius]],
{{math|''L''{{su|b=''n'' − ''ℓ'' − 1|p=2''ℓ'' + 1}}}} are the [[Laguerre polynomial#Generalized Laguerre polynomials|generalized Laguerre polynomials]] of degree {{math|''n'' − ''ℓ'' − 1}}, {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, ... }} is the [[principal quantum number]], {{math|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0, 1, ... ''n'' − 1}} the [[azimuthal quantum number]], {{math|''m'' {{=}} −''ℓ'', −''ℓ'' + 1, ...,  ''ℓ'' − 1, ''ℓ''}} the [[magnetic quantum number]]. [[Hydrogen-like atom]]s have very similar solutions.

This solution does not take into account the spin of the electron.

In the figure of the hydrogen orbitals, the 19 sub-images are images of wave functions in position space (their norm squared). The wave functions represent the abstract state characterized by the triple of quantum numbers {{math|(''n'', ''l'', ''m'')}}, in the lower right of each image. These are the principal quantum number, the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and the magnetic quantum number. Together with one spin-projection quantum number of the electron, this is a complete set of observables.

The figure can serve to illustrate some further properties of the function spaces of wave functions. 
*In this case, the wave functions are square integrable. One can initially take the function space as the space of square integrable functions, usually denoted [[Lp space|{{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]].
*The displayed functions are solutions to the Schrödinger equation. Obviously, not every function in {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} satisfies the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom. The function space is thus a subspace of {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. 
*The displayed functions form part of a basis for the function space. To each triple {{math|(''n'', ''l'', ''m'')}}, there corresponds a basis wave function. If spin is taken into account, there are two basis functions for each triple. The function space thus has a [[countable basis]].
*The basis functions are mutually [[orthonormal]].

==Wave functions and function spaces==

The concept of [[function space]]s enters naturally in the discussion about wave functions. A function space is a set of functions, usually with some defining requirements on the functions (in the present case that they are [[square integrable]]), sometimes with an [[algebraic structure]] on the set (in the present case a [[vector space]] structure with an [[inner product]]), together with a [[topology]] on the set. The latter will sparsely be used here, it is only needed to obtain a precise definition of what it means for a subset of a function space to be [[closed set|closed]]. It will be concluded below that the function space of wave functions is a [[Hilbert space]]. This observation is the foundation of the predominant mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.

=== Vector space structure ===
A wave function is an element of a function space partly characterized by the following concrete and abstract descriptions.
* The Schrödinger equation is linear. This means that the solutions to it, wave functions, can be added and multiplied by scalars to form a new solution. The set of solutions to the Schrödinger equation is a vector space.
* The superposition principle of quantum mechanics. If {{math|Ψ}} and {{math|Φ}} are two states in the abstract space of '''states''' of a quantum mechanical system, and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are any two complex numbers, then {{math|''a''Ψ + ''b''Φ}} is a valid state as well. (Whether the [[null vector]] counts as a valid state ("no system present") is a matter of definition. The null vector does ''not'' at any rate describe the [[vacuum state]] in quantum field theory.) The set of allowable states is a vector space.

This similarity is of course not accidental. There are also a distinctions between the spaces to keep in mind.

=== Representations ===
Basic states are characterized by a set of quantum numbers. This is a set of eigenvalues of a '''maximal set''' of [[Canonical commutation relation|commuting]] [[observable]]s. Physical observables are represented by linear operators, also called observables, on the vectors space. Maximality means that there can be added to the set no further algebraically independent observables that commute with the ones already present. A choice of such a set may be called a choice of '''representation'''.

*It is a postulate of quantum mechanics that a physically observable quantity of a system, such as position, momentum, or spin, is represented by a linear [[Hermitian operator]] on the state space. The possible outcomes of measurement of the quantity are the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the operator.&lt;ref name=Weinberg_2013&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a deeper level, most observables, perhaps all, arise as generators of [[Symmetry in quantum mechanics|symmetries]].&lt;ref name=Weinberg_2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg_2002&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For this statement to make sense, the observables need to be elements of a maximal commuting set. To see this, it is a simple matter to note that, for example, the momentum operator of the i'th particle in a n-particle system is ''not'' a generator of any symmetry in nature. On the other hand, the ''total'' momentum ''is'' a generator of a symmetry in nature; the translational symmetry.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The physical interpretation is that such a set represents what can – in theory – be simultaneously be measured with arbitrary precision. The [[Heisenberg uncertainty relation]] prohibits simultaneous exact measurements of two non-commuting observables.
*The set is non-unique. It may for a one-particle system, for example, be position and spin {{math|''z''}}-projection, {{math|(''x'', ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, or it may be momentum and spin {{math|''y''}}-projection, {{math|(''p'', ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. In this case, the operator corresponding to position (a [[multiplication operator]] in the position representation) and the operator corresponding to momentum (a [[differential operator]] in the position representation) do not commute.
*Once a representation is chosen, there is still arbitrariness. It remains to choose a coordinate system. This may, for example, correspond to a choice of {{math|''x'', ''y''}}- and {{math|''z''}}-axis, or a choice of '''curvilinear coordinates''' as exemplified by the [[spherical coordinates]] used for the Hydrogen atomic wave functions. This final choice also fixes a basis in abstract Hilbert space. The basic states are labeled by the quantum numbers corresponding to the maximal set of commuting observables and an appropriate coordinate system.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The resulting basis may or may not technically be a basis in the mathematical sense of Hilbert spaces. For instance, states of definite position and definite momentum are not square integrable. This may be overcome with the use of [[wave packet]]s or by enclosing the system in a "box". See further remarks below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abstract states are "abstract" only in that an arbitrary choice necessary for a particular ''explicit'' description of it is not given. This is the same as saying that no choice of maximal set of commuting observables has been given. This is analogous to a vector space without a specified basis. Wave functions corresponding to a state are accordingly not unique. This non-uniqueness reflects the non-uniqueness in the choice of a maximal set of commuting observables. For one spin particle in one dimension, to a particular state there corresponds two wave functions, {{math|Ψ(''x'', ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|Ψ(''p'', ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, both describing the ''same'' state. 
*For each choice of maximal commuting sets of observables for the abstract state space, there is a corresponding representation that is associated to a function space of wave functions.
*Between all these different function spaces and the abstract state space, there are one-to-one correspondences (here disregarding normalization and unobservable phase factors), the common denominator here being a particular abstract state. The relationship between the momentum and position space wave functions, for instance, describing the same state is the [[Fourier transform]].

Each choice of representation should be thought of as specifying a unique function space in which wave functions corresponding to that choice of representation lives. This distinction is best kept, even if one could argue that two such function spaces are mathematically equal, e.g. being the set of square integrable functions. One can then think of the function spaces as two distinct copies of that set.

=== Inner product ===
There is an additional algebraic structure on the vector spaces of wave functions and the abstract state space.
* Physically, different wave functions are interpreted to overlap to some degree. A system in a state {{math|Ψ}} that does ''not'' overlap with a state {{math|Φ}} cannot be found to be in the state {{math|Φ}} upon measurement. But if {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} overlap {{math|Ψ}} to ''some'' degree, there is a chance that measurement of a system described by {{math|Ψ}} will be found in states {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} . Also [[selection rule]]s are observed apply. These are usually formulated in the preservation of some quantum numbers. This means that certain processes allowable from some perspectives (e.g. energy and momentum conservation) do not occur because the initial and final ''total'' wave functions don't overlap.
* Mathematically, it turns out that solutions to the Schrödinger equation for particular potentials are '''orthogonal''' in some manner, this is usually described by an integral

::&lt;math&gt;\int\Psi_m^*\Psi_n w\, dV = \delta_{nm},&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{math|''m'', ''n''}} are (sets of) indices (quantum numbers) labeling different solutions, the strictly positive function {{mvar|w}} is called a weight function, and {{math|''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The integration is taken over all of the relevant space.
This motivates the introduction of an [[inner product]] on the vector space of abstract quantum states, compatible with the mathematical observations above when passing to a representation. It is denoted {{math|(Ψ, Φ)}}, or in the [[Bra–ket notation]] {{math|{{braket|bra-ket|Ψ|Φ}}}}. It yields a complex number. With the inner product, the function space is an [[inner product space]]. The explicit appearance of the inner product (usually an integral or a sum of integrals) depends on the choice of representation, but the complex number {{math|(Ψ, Φ)}} does not. Much of the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics stems from the [[Born rule]]. It states that the probability {{mvar|p}} of finding upon measurement the state {{math|Φ}} given the system is in the state {{math|Ψ}} is
:&lt;math&gt;p = |(\Phi, \Psi)|^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|Φ}} and {{math|Ψ}} are assumed normalized. Consider a [[Scattering theory|scattering experiment]]. In quantum field theory, if {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;}} describes a state in the "distant future" (an "out state") after interactions between scattering particles have ceased, and {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;}} an "in state" in the "distant past", then the quantities {{math|(Φ&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;, Ψ&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, with {{math|Φ&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|Ψ&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;}} varying over a complete set of in states and out states respectively, is called the [[S-matrix]] or '''scattering matrix'''. Knowledge of it is, effectively, having ''solved'' the theory at hand, at least as far as predictions go. Measurable quantities such as [[decay rate]]s and [[scattering cross section]]s are calculable from the S-matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002|loc=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hilbert space ===
The above observations encapsulate the essence of the function spaces of which wave functions are elements. However, the description is not yet complete. There is a further technical requirement on the function space, that of [[Complete metric space|completeness]], that allows one to take limits of sequences in the function space, and be ensured that, if the limit exists, it is an element of the function space. A complete inner product space is called a [[Hilbert space]]. The property of completeness is crucial in advanced treatments and applications of quantum mechanics. For instance, the existence of [[projection operator]]s or '''orthogonal projections''' relies on the completeness of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projection operators, in turn, are essential for the statement and proof of many useful theorems, e.g. the [[spectral theorem]]. It is not very important in introductory quantum mechanics, and technical details and links may be found in footnotes like the one that follows.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In technical terms, this is formulated the following way. The inner product yields a [[Normed vector space|norm]]. This norm, in turn, induces a [[Metric space|metric]]. If this metric is [[Complete metric|complete]], then the aforementioned limits will be in the function space. The inner product space is then called complete. A complete inner product space is a [[Hilbert space]]. The abstract state space is always taken as a Hilbert space. The matching requirement for the function spaces is a natural one. The Hilbert space property of the abstract state space was originally extracted from the observation that the function spaces forming normalizable solutions to the Schrödinger equation are Hilbert spaces.&lt;/ref&gt; The space {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a Hilbert space, with inner product presented later. The function space of the example of the figure is a subspace of {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A subspace of a Hilbert space is a Hilbert space if it is closed.

In summary, the set of all possible normalizable wave functions for a system with a particular choice of basis, together with the null vector, constitute a Hilbert space.

Not all functions of interest are elements of some Hilbert space, say {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The most glaring example is the set of functions {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|2''πi'''''p''' · '''x'''|h}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. These are plane wave solutions of the Schrödinger equation for a free particle, but are not normalizable, hence not in {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. But they are nonetheless fundamental for the description. One can, using them, express functions that ''are'' normalizable using [[wave packet]]s. They are, in a sense, a basis (but not a Hilbert space basis, nor a [[Hamel basis]]) in which wave functions of interest can be expressed. There is also the artifact "normalization to a delta function" that is frequently employed for notational convenience, see further down. The delta functions themselves aren't square integrable either.

The above description of the function space containing the wave functions is mostly mathematically motivated. The function spaces are, due to completeness, very ''large'' in a certain sense. Not all functions are realistic descriptions of any physical system. For instance, in the function space {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} one can find the function that takes on the value {{math|0}} for all rational numbers and {{math|-''i''}} for the irrationals in the interval {{math|[0, 1]}}. This ''is'' square integrable,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;As is explained in a later footnote, the integral must be taken to be the [[Lebesgue integral]], the [[Riemann integral]] is not sufficient.&lt;/ref&gt; but can hardly represent a physical state.

=== Common Hilbert spaces ===
While the space of solutions as a whole is a Hilbert space there are many other Hilbert spaces that commonly occur as ingredients.
*Square integrable complex valued functions on the interval {{math|[0, 2''π'']}}. The set {{math|{''e''&lt;sup&gt;''int''&lt;/sup&gt;/2''π'', ''n'' ∈ ℤ} }} is a Hilbert space basis, i.e. a maximal orthonormal set.
*The [[Fourier transform]] takes functions in the above space to elements of {{math|''l''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(ℤ)}}, the space of ''square summable'' functions {{math|ℤ → ℂ}}. The latter space is a Hilbert space and the Fourier transform is an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;{{harvnb|Conway|1990}}. This means that inner products, hence norms, are preserved and that the mapping is a bounded, hence continuous, linear bijection. The property of completeness is preserved as well. Thus this is the right concept of isomorphism in the [[category theory|category]] of Hilbert spaces.&lt;/ref&gt; Its basis is {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' ∈ ℤ&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} with {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''j'') {{=}} ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'', ''j'' ∈ ℤ}}.
*The most basic example of spanning polynomials is in the space of square integrable functions on the interval {{math|[–1, 1]}} for which the [[Legendre polynomials]] is a Hilbert space basis (complete orthonormal set).
*The square integrable functions on the [[unit sphere]] {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a Hilbert space. The basis functions in this case are the [[spherical harmonics]]. The Legendre polynomials are ingredients in the spherical harmonics. Most problems with rotational symmetry will have "the same" (known) solution with respect to that symmetry, so the original problem is reduced to a problem of lower dimensionality.
*The [[Laguerre polynomials|associated Laguerre polynomials]] appear in the hydrogenic wave function problem after factoring out the spherical harmonics. These span the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the semi-infinite interval {{math|[0, ∞)}}.

More generally, one may consider a unified treatment of all second order polynomial solutions to the [[Sturm–Liouville theory|Sturm–Liouville equations]] in the setting of Hilbert space. These include the Legendre and Laguerre polynomials as well as [[Chebyshev polynomials]], [[Jacobi polynomials]] and [[Hermite polynomials]]. All of these actually appear in physical problems, the latter ones in the [[Harmonic oscillator (quantum)|harmonic oscillator]], and what is otherwise a bewildering maze of properties of [[special functions]] becomes an organized body of facts. For this, see {{harvtxt|Byron|Fuller|1992|loc=Chapter 5}}.

There occurs also finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The space {{math|ℂ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a Hilbert space of dimension {{mvar|n}}. The inner product is the standard inner product on these spaces. In it, the "spin part" of a single particle wave function resides.
*In the non-relativistic description of an electron one has {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}} and the total wave function is a solution of the [[Pauli equation]].
*In the corresponding relativistic treatment, {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}} and the wave function solves the [[Dirac equation]].
With more particles, the situations is more complicated. One has to employ [[tensor product]]s and use representation theory of the symmetry groups involved (the [[rotation group]] and the [[Lorentz group]] respectively) to extract from the tensor product the spaces in which the (total) spin wave functions reside. (Further problems arise in the relativistic case unless the particles are free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|Reinhardt|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[Bethe–Salpeter equation]].) Corresponding remarks apply to the concept of [[isospin]], for which the symmetry group is [[SU(2)]]. The models of the nuclear forces of the sixties (still useful today, see [[nuclear force]]) used the symmetry group [[SU(3)]]. In this case, as well, the part of the wave functions corresponding to the inner symmetries reside in some {{math|ℂ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} or subspaces of tensor products of such spaces.

*In quantum field theory the underlying Hilbert space is [[Fock space]]. It is built from free single-particle states, i.e. wave functions when a representation is chosen, and can accommodate any finite, not necessarily constant in time, number of particles. The interesting (or rather the ''tractable'') dynamics lies not in the wave functions but in the [[field operator]]s that are operators acting on Fock space. Thus the [[Heisenberg picture]] is the most common choice (constant states, time varying operators).
Due to the infinite-dimensional nature of the system, the appropriate mathematical tools are objects of study in [[functional analysis]].

=== Simplified description ===
[[File:wavefunction continuity space.svg|180px|thumb|Continuity of the wave function and its first spatial derivative (in the ''x'' direction, ''y'' and ''z'' coordinates not shown), at some time ''t''.]]
Not all introductory textbooks take the long route and introduce the full Hilbert space machinery, but the focus is on the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation in position representation for certain standard potentials. The following constraints on the wave function are sometimes explicitly formulated for the calculations and physical interpretation to make sense:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisberg|Resnick|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The wave function must be [[square integrable]]. This is motivated by the Copenhagen interpretation of the wave function as a probability amplitude.
*It must be everywhere [[continuous function|continuous]] and everywhere [[continuously differentiable]]. This is motivated by the appearance of the Schrödinger equation for most physically reasonable potentials.

It is possible to relax these conditions somewhat for special purposes.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;One such relaxation is that the wave function must belong to the [[Sobolev space]] ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;. It means that it is differentiable in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], and its [[gradient]] is [[square-integrable]]. This relaxation is necessary for potentials that are not functions but are distributions, such as the [[Dirac delta function]].&lt;/ref&gt; If these requirements are not met, it is not possible to interpret the wave function as a probability amplitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkins|1974|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not alter the structure of the Hilbert space that these particular wave functions inhabit, but it should be pointed out that the subspace of the square-integrable functions {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is a Hilbert space, satisfying the second requirement ''is not closed'' in {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, hence not a Hilbert space in itself.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;It is easy to visualize a sequence of functions meeting the requirement that converges to a ''discontinuous'' function. For this, modify an example given in [[Inner product space#Examples]]. This element though ''is'' an element of {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The functions that does not meet the requirements are still needed for both technical and practical reasons.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For instance, in [[perturbation theory]] one may construct a sequence of functions approximating the true wave function. This sequence will be guaranteed to converge in a larger space, but without the assumption of a full-fledged Hilbert space, it will not be guaranteed that the convergence is to a function in the relevant space and hence solving the original problem.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some functions not being square-integrable, like the plane-wave free particle solutions are necessary for the description as outlined in a previous note and also further below.&lt;/ref&gt;

== More on wave functions and abstract state space ==
{{main article|Quantum state}}
As has been demonstrated, the set of all possible wave functions in some representation for a system constitute an in general [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite-dimensional]] Hilbert space. Due to the multiple possible choices of representation basis, these Hilbert spaces are not unique. One therefore talks about an abstract Hilbert space, '''state space''', where the choice of representation and basis is left undetermined. Specifically, each state is represented as an abstract vector in state space.&lt;ref name=Dirac_1982&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; A quantum state {{math|{{ket|Ψ}}}} in any representation is generally expressed as a vector

:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle
=
\sum_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}\int d^m\!\boldsymbol{\omega}\,\,
\Psi(\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{\omega},t)\,
|\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{\omega}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where 

* {{math|{{ket|'''α''', '''ω'''}}}} the basis vectors of the chosen representation
* {{math|''d&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'''''ω''' {{=}} ''dω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''dω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''dω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} a "[[differential volume element]]" in the continuous degrees of freedom
* {{math|Ψ('''α''', '''ω''', ''t'')}} a component of the vector {{math|{{ket|Ψ}}}}, called the '''wave function''' of the system
* {{math|'''α''' {{=}} (''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} dimensionless discrete quantum numbers
* {{math|'''ω''' {{=}} (''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} continuous variables (not necessarily dimensionless) 

These quantum numbers index the components of the state vector. More, all {{math|'''α'''}} are in an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × ... ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} where each {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the set of allowed values for {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}; all {{math|'''ω'''}} are in an {{math|''m''}}-dimensional "volume" {{math|Ω ⊆ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{math|Ω {{=}} Ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × Ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × ... Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and each {{math|Ω&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ℝ}} is the set of allowed values for {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, a [[subset]] of the [[real number]]s {{math|ℝ}}. For generality {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''m''}} are not necessarily equal.

'''Example:''' 

(a) For a single particle in 3d with spin ''s'', neglecting other degrees of freedom, using Cartesian coordinates, we could take {{math|'''α''' {{=}} (''s&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for the spin quantum number of the particle along the z direction, and {{math|'''ω''' {{=}} (''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} for the particle's position coordinates. Here {{math|''A'' {{=}} {−''s'', −''s'' + 1, ..., ''s'' − 1, ''s''} }} is the set of allowed spin quantum numbers and {{math|Ω {{=}} ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the set of all possible particle positions throughout 3d position space. 

(b) An alternative choice is {{math|'''α''' {{=}} (''s&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for the spin quantum number along the y direction and {{math|'''ω''' {{=}} (''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for the particle's momentum components. In this case {{math|''A''}} and {{math|Ω}} are the same as before.

The [[probability density]] of finding the system at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;at state {{math|{{ket|'''α''', '''ω'''}}}} is

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{\alpha, \omega} (t)= |\Psi(\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{\omega},t)|^2&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of finding system with {{math|'''α'''}} in some or all possible discrete-variable configurations, {{math|''D'' ⊆ ''A''}}, and {{math|'''ω'''}} in some or all possible continuous-variable configurations, {{math|''C'' ⊆ Ω}}, is the sum and integral over the density,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Here 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \equiv \sum_{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n} \equiv \sum_{\alpha_1}\sum_{\alpha_2}\cdots\sum_{\alpha_n} &lt;/math&gt;
is a multiple sum.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\sum_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in D}\int_C \rho_{\alpha, \omega} (t) \,\, d^m\!\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the sum of all probabilities must be 1, the '''normalization condition'''

:&lt;math&gt;1=\sum_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in A}\int_{\Omega} \rho_{\alpha, \omega} (t) \,\, d^m\!\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

must hold at all times during the evolution of the system.

The normalization condition requires {{math|''ρ d&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'''''ω'''}} to be dimensionless, by [[dimensional analysis]] {{math|Ψ}} must have the same units as {{math|(''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

{{main article|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}

Whether the wave function really exists, and what it represents, are major questions in the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]]. Many famous physicists of a previous generation puzzled over this problem, such as [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]]. Some advocate formulations or variants of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] (e.g. Bohr, [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]] and [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]) while others, such as [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler]] or [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Jaynes]], take the more classical approach&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaynes|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regard the wave function as representing information in the mind of the observer, i.e. a measure of our knowledge of reality.  Some, including Schrödinger, [[David Bohm|Bohm]] and [[Hugh Everett III|Everett]] and others, argued that the wave function must have an objective, physical existence. Einstein thought that a complete description of physical reality should refer directly to physical space and time, as distinct from the wave function, which refers to an abstract mathematical space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1998|p=682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Zingana Holz.JPG|thumb|300px|Zebrawood]]
The name '''zebrawood''' is used to describe several tree species and the wood derived from them. Zebrawood is characterized by a striped [[figure (wood)|figure]] that is reminiscent of a [[zebra]]. The name originally applied to the wood of ''[[Astronium graveolens]]'',{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} a large tree native to Central America. In the 20th century, the most important source of zebrawood was ''[[Microberlinia brazzavillensis]]'',{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} a tree native to Central Africa. Other sources include Brazilian ''[[Astronium fraxinifolium]]'', African ''[[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'',{{dubious|date=November 2014}} Pacific ''[[Guettarda speciosa]]'',{{dubious|date=November 2014}} and Asian ''[[Pistacia integerrima]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==History==
Zebrawood was first recorded in the British Customs returns for 1773, when 180 pieces of zebrawood were imported from the [[Mosquito Coast]], a British colony (now Republic of Honduras and Nicaragua).&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''History of Jamaica'' (1774), [[Edward Long]] relates, 'The species of zebra wood at present in esteem among the cabinet-makers is brought to Jamaica from the Mosquito shore; it is of a most lovely tint, and richly veined...'.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Long, ''History of Jamaica'', 3 Vols, London (1774), III, pp. 837-8.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Mosquito Coast thereafter exported zebrawood regularly until the [[Convention of London (1786)]] and the consequent expulsion of British settlers from this part of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]].

An alternative name which occurs in 18th century British sources is '''palmaletto''' or '''palmalatta''', from ''palo mulatto'', which was the local name for the wood.  At the beginning of the 19th century, another source of zebrawood was found in Brazil.  This species, ''[[Astronium fraxinifolium]]'', is native to northern South America, especially north-eastern Brazil.  It is now traded as [[goncalo alves]], a Portuguese name used in Brazil.  On the European and American markets, however, it was still called zebrawood, and commonly used in British furniture-making between about 1810 and 1860. 
 
For most of the 19th century, the botanical identity of zebrawood was unknown.  For many years, it was thought to be the product of ''Omphalobium lambertii'' DC., later reclassified as ''Connarus guianensis'' Lamb ex DC., and finally as ''[[Connarus lambertii]]'' (DC.) Britton.  Despite similarities between the timbers of ''Connarus'' and ''[[Astronium]]'', the former has yet to be identified on surviving furniture.  "Published statements that certain species [of ''Connarus''] supply furniture woods are undoubtedly incorrect."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Record &amp; Robert W. Hess, ''Timbers of the New World'', New York (1972), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the name zebrawood, as applied to ''[[Astronium]]'' species, went out of use.  The word now usually refers to wood of the very different African tree ''[[Microberlinia brazzavillensis]]'', but may be applied to other woods, mostly belonging to the same [[Fabaceae]] family, but not exclusively so, for example: ''[[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'' [[Goncalo alves]].

== Zebrawood proper ==
The wood of ''[[Microberlinia]]'' (also known as Zebrano) is imported from central Africa, (Gabon, Cameroon, and Congo).  The heartwood is a pale golden yellow, distinct from the very pale color of the sapwood and features narrow streaks of dark brown to black.  Zebrawood can also be a pale brown with regular or irregular marks of dark brown in varying widths.  It is almost always [[quartersawn]] to get the exciting alternating color pattern.

It is a heavy, hard wood with a somewhat coarse texture, often with an interlocked or wavy grain.  The interlocked grain of this wood, like that of many tropical woods, can make it difficult to work. It is also a decorative exotic wood, used in a limited way for veneer, wall paneling, custom furniture, furniture trim, inlay bandings, marquetry, specialty items and turnery. It is also sometimes seen as [[Stock (firearm)|stock]]s of [[shotgun]]s and [[rifle]]s or in exotic [[guitar]]s. In the past, it was used in [[Cadillac]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] automobiles. Because of its hardness, it can also be used for [[ski]]s and tool handles.
