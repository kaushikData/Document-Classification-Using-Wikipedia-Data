The singer-songwriter pays tribute to strong, independent women and the men and women who love them, reinforcing the need for love, equality, and tolerance for all. And while promoting these causes, she makes music that sounds really, really wondrous.&lt;ref&gt;https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/aclarke&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Bruno Bauch''' ({{IPA-de|baʊx|lang}}; January 19, 1877 in [[Nossen|Groß-Nossen]] – February 27, 1942 in [[Jena]]) was a German [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] [[philosophy|philosopher]].

==Biography==
Bauch was born in [[Nossen|Groß-Nossen]], [[Frankenstein district|Münsterberg district]],&lt;!--Ehemalige Landkreise und regionale Verwaltungseinheiten in Schlesien (1815–1945): Landkreis Frankenstein (Schlesien)--&gt; [[Silesia Province|Silesia]] (now in [[Poland]]) and studied philosophy at [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]]. In 1901, he received his doctorate under [[Heinrich Rickert]] at Freiburg,&lt;ref&gt;His thesis was published in 1902 under the title ''Glückseligkeit und Persönlichkeit in der kritischen Ethik'' (''Happiness and Personality in Critical Ethics'').&lt;/ref&gt; which entitled him to teach some courses (one of his students was [[Rudolf Carnap]] later became a central figure of the [[Vienna Circle]]). Bauch completed his [[Habilitation]], entitling him to a professorship, at the [[University of Halle]] in 1903. He taught as a "titular professor" at Halle from 1903 to 1910, and from 1911 onward as an "ordinary professor" at the [[University of Jena]].

==Work==

At Jena, he befriended [[Gottlob Frege]] and collaborated with the Neo-Kantian philosopher of language [[Richard Hönigswald]]. Bauch was an influential figure in the Kant-Gesellschaft (Kant Society) and helped publish the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Prussian Academy]]'s edition of Kant's collected works. Until 1916, he was editor of the Kant Society's journal, ''Kant-Studien'' (Kant Studies). He was forced to resign after publishing an [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] article in a right-wing nationalist tabloid, which caused a storm of controversy in the Kant Society. (Many Neo-Kantians, including Bauch's subsequent colleague Hönigswald, were Jewish, and quite a few were social democrats.) In 1917, Bauch founded a philosophical society of his own, the German Philosophical Society, which issued the journal ''Beiträge zur Philosophie des Deutschen Idealismus'' (Contributions to the Philosophy of German Idealism). Frege was among its contributors. When the Nazis came to power, Bauch's political views stood him in good stead. While many Neo-Kantians had to emigrate and some ended up in concentration camps (including, for a year, Hönigswald), Bauch became head of the German Philosophical Society in 1934.

===Philosophy style===
[[Heinrich Rickert]], whom Bauch studied under, was the most important leader of the so-called [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Badensian]], or Southwest German School of Neo-Kantianism after [[Wilhelm Windelband]]. Unlike its main rival, the Marburg School, the Badensian Neo-Kantians were more interested in practical philosophy than in the [[philosophy of science]]. They emphasized the distinction between fact and value and sought to use the concept of "value" for [[epistemological]] and [[ontology|ontological]] purposes. For example, to say that a sentence is "true" is sometimes equated with saying that it 'commands assent' (i.e., that it ''ought'' to be believed). Bauch, however, was a rather unorthodox scion of the Badensian school, so much so that some commentators regard him as representing a distinct variety of Neo-Kantianism. While Bauch shared an interest in the philosophy of value, he also had a much more lively interest in the philosophy of mathematics and logic than was common among the Badensian Neo-Kantians. Unlike Rickert, he was sympathetic to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s logicism (which Rickert had rejected on the old-fashioned Kantian grounds that logic was analytic, mathematics synthetic), and was conciliatory toward the Marburg Neo-Kantians' belief in the unity of logic and mathematics.

'''Bundle theory''', originated by the 18th century Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]], is the [[ontology|ontological]] theory about [[Object (philosophy)|objecthood]] in which an object consists only of a collection (''bundle'') of properties, relations or [[trope (philosophy)|tropes]].

According to bundle theory, an object consists of its properties and nothing more: thus neither can there be an object without properties nor can one even ''conceive'' of such an object; for example, bundle theory claims that thinking of an apple compels one also to think of its color, its shape, the fact that it is a kind of fruit, its cells, its taste, or at least one other of its properties.  Thus, the theory asserts that the apple is no more than the collection of its properties.  In particular, there is no ''[[substance theory|substance]]'' in which the properties are ''[[inherence|inherent]]''.

==Arguments for the bundle theory==
The difficulty in conceiving of or describing an object without also conceiving of or describing its properties is a common justification for bundle theory, especially among current philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition.

The inability to comprehend any aspect of the thing other than its properties implies, this argument maintains, that one cannot conceive of a ''bare particular'' (a ''substance'' without properties), an implication that directly opposes [[substance theory]].  The conceptual difficulty of ''bare particulars'' was illustrated by [[John Locke]] when he described a ''substance'' by itself, apart from its properties, as ''"something, I know not what. [...] The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing but the supposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia; which, according to the true import of the word, is, in plain English, standing under or upholding."''&lt;ref&gt;John Locke: An essay concerning human understanding (1689), Chapter XXIII, Of our Complex Ideas of Substances&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a ''relation'' of an object is one of its properties may complicate such an argument.  However, the argument concludes that the conceptual challenge of ''bare particulars'' leaves a bundle of properties and nothing more as the only possible conception of an object, thus justifying bundle theory.

==Objections to the bundle theory==
Bundle theory maintains that properties are ''bundled'' together in a collection without describing how they are tied together. For example, bundle theory regards an apple as red, four inches (100&amp;nbsp;mm) wide, and juicy but lacking an underlying ''substance''. The apple is said to be a ''bundle of properties'' including redness, being four inches (100&amp;nbsp;mm) wide, and juiciness.

Critics question how bundle theory accounts for the properties' ''[[wikt:compresence|compresence]]'' (the ''togetherness'' relation between those properties) without an underlying ''substance''. Critics also question how any two given properties are determined to be properties of the same object if there is no ''substance'' in which they both ''inhere''.

Traditional bundle theory explains the ''compresence'' of properties by defining an object as a collection of properties ''bound'' together. Thus, different combinations of properties and relations produce different objects. Redness and juiciness, for example, may be found together on top of the table because they are part of a bundle of properties located on the table, one of which is the "looks like an apple" property.

By contrast, [[substance theory]] explains the ''compresence'' of properties by asserting that the properties are found together because it is the ''substance'' that has those properties. In substance theory, a ''substance'' is the thing in which properties ''inhere''. For example, redness and juiciness are found on top of the table because redness and juiciness ''inhere'' in an apple, making the apple red and juicy.

The ''bundle theory of substance'' explains ''compresence''. Specifically, it maintains that properties' compresence itself engenders a ''substance''. Thus, it determines ''substancehood'' empirically by the ''togetherness'' of properties rather than by a ''bare particular'' or by any other non-empirical underlying strata. The ''bundle theory of substance'' thus rejects the substance theories of [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], and more recently, [[J. P. Moreland]], Jia Hou, Joseph Bridgman, [[Quentin Smith]], and others.

==Bundle theory and Buddhism==
The Buddhist [[Madhyamaka]] philosopher, [[Chandrakirti]], used the aggregate nature of objects to demonstrate the lack of [[essence]] in what is known as the sevenfold reasoning. In his work, ''[[Madhyamakāvatāra|Guide to the Middle Way]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Madhyamakāvatāra''), he says:

{{quote|[The self] is like a cart, which is not other than its parts, not non-other, and does not possess them. It is not within its parts, and its parts are not within it. It is not the mere collection, and it is not the shape.&lt;ref&gt;Chandrakiri, ''Guide to the Middle Way'', VI.151, translation in ''Ocean of Nectar'', p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He goes on to explain what is meant by each of these seven assertions, but briefly in a subsequent commentary he explains that the conventions of the world do not exist essentially when closely analyzed, but exist only through being taken for granted, without being subject to scrutiny that searches for an essence within them.

Another view of the Buddhist theory of the self, especially in early Buddhism, is that the Buddhist theory is essentially an eliminativist theory. According to this understanding, the self can not be reduced to a bundle because there is nothing that answers to the concept of a self. Consequently, the idea of a self must be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;James Giles, ''No Self to be Found: The Search for Personal Identity'', University Press of America, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Centre for Media &amp; Information Literacy==
Onumah is coordinator of the African Centre for Media &amp; Information Literacy (AFRICMIL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sahara Reporters|title=Chido Onumah|url=http://saharareporters.com/column/chido-onumah|publisher=Sahara Reports|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFRICMIL was set up in 2008 following the resolution of the 1st Africa Media &amp; Information Literacy Conference in July 2008 in Abuja, organised in conjunction with [[British Council]], Nigeria, and the National Film &amp; Video Censors Board (NFVCB).

==Pan-African Alliance for Media &amp; Information Literacy==
Onumah is the chair of the Pan-African Alliance for Media &amp; Information Literacy (PAMIL) and Co-Chair of Global Alliance on Media and Information Literacy (GAPMIL).

==Controversies==
Onumah has generated intense discussions on governance, human rights abuses, and corruption through his expository articles and essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abdul|first1=Mahmud|title=Are we all Biafrans?|url=https://www.naij.com/829143-biafrans.html|accessdate=7 October 2016|publisher=Naij.com|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has often questioned the credibility of some political office holders and frowned at exclusion of youth in governance. One of his books titled: We Are All Biafrans, which talks about restructuring Nigeria, has continued to generate debate among political leaders, the media and civil society across Nigeria. The book uses Biafra as a metaphor for the various agitations in Nigeria. It calls for political restructuring as a basis for enhancing Nigeria's unity and building an egalitarian society.

'''Confucian art''' is art inspired by the writings of [[Confucius]], and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings. Confucian art originated in [[China]], then spread westwards on the [[Silk road]], southward down to [[Northern and southern China|southern China]] and then onto [[Southeast Asia]], and eastwards through [[North China|northern China]] on to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. While it still maintains a strong influence within Indonesia, Confucian influence on western art has been limited. While Confucian themes enjoyed representation in Chinese art centers, they are fewer in comparison to the number of artworks that are about or influenced by [[Taoism|Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese Religious Art|last=Karetzky|first=Patricia|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2014|isbn=9780739180587|location=Lanham, MD|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements and themes ==
When Confucius was elevated to the rank of Supreme Sage and the Uncrown King (''Su Wang''), Confucian art became identified with the art of Confucius in recognition to the sage's central position in the transmission of the Chinese ancient culture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Confucianism|last=Yao|first=Xinzhong|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415515221|location=Oxon|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable elements of this art are calligraphy of Confucian writings and thoughts, often contained within [[Confucian temple]]s and [[schools]], as well as whiteware ceramics and pottery related to Confucian religious and scholarly practices. In China, [[Chinese scholar's rocks]] were part of this tradition. As most importantly the [[Korean stone art]] which continues to this day. Themes and subjects usually include the depiction of prominent Confucian figures such as statesmen, poets, and painters, among others. These are the subjects, for instance, of the paintings of [[Zhang Lu (painter)|Zhang Lu]] (1464-1538). Artworks also reflected prevailing interests during the Confucian period such as [[chess]], music, and painting in addition to the depiction of the didactic pictorial narratives of the life of Confucius and the twenty-four paragons of [[filial piety]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Confucian art is demonstrated in the Six Classics: ''[[Classic of Poetry|The Book of Odes]]'', which describes the will; the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', which describes events; ''The Book of Ritual,'' which focuses on conduct; ''[[Classic of Music|The Book of Music]]'', which is about harmony; the ''[[I Ching|Book of Changes]]'' for the concept of the [[yin and yang]]; and, [[Spring and Autumn Annals|The Spring and Autumn Annals]], which describes titles and functions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Confucian art may also be distinguished between classical early period, neo-Confucianism, and post-modern Confucian art.

== Ancient Cultivation Stories: Confucius and Ran Qiu ==

Every one of Confucius' students had his own character. Some were modest and keen to learn; some were strong and argumentative; some were cowardly and slow to improve. However, Confucius would teach each student according to his nature guiding him along the way so that he/she may become a useful and talented person.

Ran Qiu was a very talented person. He really hoped to improve his political abilities and obtain the opportunity to be promoted to become a government official after learning from Confucius.

Officials in ancient times had to understand poetry, literature, ritual, and music, only when they had a good understanding of this knowledge could they work for the people. In order to improve on these abilities to become a government official, Ran Qiu followed Confucius as his teacher and diligently studied a variety of subjects and skills.

After some time, however, Confucius found that Ran Qiu had become idle and lazy and was no longer curious to understand and discuss the principles taught in the class. Therefore, one day after the class, Confucius asked Ran Qiu the reason for this.

Ran Qiu said, "It is not that I don't like the principles that you teach. It is just because I am lacking in ability!"

In fact, Ran Qiu thought that the principles that Confucius taught were too high and were different from what he had expected them to be. Ran Qiu had only planned to learn from Confucius the abilities necessary to become a government official. Then, with the help of Confucius' reputation, he would get the chance to start his political career. But when he came to Confucius's school, he found that the principles Confucius taught seemed to be apart from society. Though the ideals were high, it was not easy to follow them in practice.

Holding such thoughts, Ran Qiu started to become lazy and felt it was useless no matter how much more he learned. In addition, Ran Qiu also attributed his poor performance in the class to his own insufficient abilities. He thought that, since he was not capable enough, he would never be able to achieve the level that Confucius was teaching, so why did he need to study carefully?

Confucius however didn't think that Ran Qiu's declining performance was due to a lack of ability. Therefore, he told Ran Qiu, "Look at those people who don't have enough ability. They usually stop and give up halfway, whereas you draw a boundary in front of yourself to restrict you from moving forward. How can you make progress that way?"

After hearing what Confucius had to say, Ran Qiu was ashamed and lowered his head. Confucius continued, "Before you fully demonstrate your ability, you should not easily give up the effort to strive forward; you shouldn't feel so desperate about yourself so easily. As long as you try your best to do everything well, you will find that you have good potential!"

After Confucius had encouraged him, Ran Qiu was again full of confidence and resumed his usual earnest learning attitude. It was after this that Ran Qiu took note of Confucius' skills as a teacher!

==History==
In recognition of the substantial importance a woman's role and motherhood was in support of a strong Germany,&lt;ref name="AUTH-WB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-MM"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Michelle Mouton, University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh |first = |authorlink = |title = From Nurturing the Nation to Purifying the Volk – Weimar and Nazi Family Policy, 1918–1945 |publisher = [http://www.cambridge.org/ Cambridge University Press] |series = [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/series/series_display/item3937755/?site_locale=en_GB Publications of the German Historical Institute] |year = 2007 |location = Cambridge |url = http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173587/?site_locale=en_GB |isbn = 978-0-521-86184-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Cross of Honour of the German Mother was introduced by [[decree]] in Berlin on 16 December 1938 by  [[Führer|Führer und Reichskanzler]] (leader and chancellor) [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name="VRNG-MC" /&gt; The preamble of the statutory decree declared:
:As a visible sign of gratitude of the German nation to children-rich mothers I establish this Cross of Honour of the German Mother (Original text in German: ”Als sichtbares Zeichen des Dankes des Deutschen Volkes an kinderreiche Mütter stifte ich das Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter”).&lt;ref name="VRNG-MC" /&gt;

The crosses were awarded annually on the second Sunday in May ([[Mothering Sunday]] or Mother's Day), but also extended to include other national annual occasions of celebration.&lt;ref name="EXBT2-MC"&gt;There were sighted public exhibits of government issued deeds' of conferral (Besitzeugnis/Verleihungsurkunde) to recipient mothers for the Mother’s Cross on other national annual dates of celebration.&lt;/ref&gt; So despite its institution in 1938, the first awards were rendered in May 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Angolia, John R. ''For Führer and Fatherland: Political &amp; Civil Awards of the Third Reich'', pp 67–69, {{ISBN|978-0912138169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decoration==
The Mother's Cross was composed of three classes,&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt; and conferred to mothers in accordance with its statutory legislation: ''Verordnung des Führers und Reichskanzlers über die Stiftung des Ehrenkreuzes der Deutschen Mutter vom 16. Dezember 1938. Reichsgesetzblatt (RGBI) Teil I, 1938, Nr. 224, Seite 1923'' (In English: Statutory Order of the Leader and Chancellor on the establishment of the Cross of Honour of the German Mother of 16 December 1938. Imperial-(Reichs) Law Gazette (RGBl) Part I, 1938, No. 224, Page 1923),&lt;ref name="VRNG-MC" /&gt; and its stringent nomination screening protocol.&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC"&gt;'''Protocol Document of the Deutsches Reich:''' Public exhibit – official government issued document: “Merkblatt – für die Auslese der Mutter, die für Verleihung des Ehrenkreuzes der Deutschen Mutter vorgeschlagen werden sollen” (In English: Information Sheet – for the nomination screening of a Mother, who is to be recommended for the bestow of the Cross of Honour of the German Mother)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classes===
* 1st class, Gold Cross: eligible mothers with eight or more children&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANLGE-MC" /&gt;
* 2nd class, Silver Cross: eligible mothers with six or seven children&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANLGE-MC" /&gt;
* 3rd class, Bronze Cross: eligible mothers with four or five children&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANLGE-MC" /&gt;

===Cross design===
The cross design is a slender elongated form of the [[Iron Cross]] or [[cross pattée]] and very similar in design to the Marian Cross of the [[Teutonic Knights]] Order (''Marianerkreuz des Deutschen Ritterordens''), [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] translucent-blue with a slim opaque-white border.&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANLGE-MC" /&gt; Resting on the centre radiant starburst rays is a metal roundel decorated with the words &lt;small&gt;”DER DEUTSCHEN MUTTER” (In English: TO THE GERMAN MOTHER)&lt;/small&gt; around an enamelled black straight centred “[[swastika]]” symbol, infilled white enamel.&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANLGE-MC" /&gt; The cross design was the creation of the established [[Munich]]-based architect and sculptor Franz Berberich. The production of the cross involved several established ''Präsidialkanzlei'' (Presidential Chancellery) approved medal makers from across the German Reich.&lt;ref name="EXBT-MC"&gt;Sighted production issue versions of the Mother’s Cross, including presentation cases and sachets by officially approved medal makers.&lt;/ref&gt; A maker's mark was never applied to the crosses produced; though each official house of manufacture did apply their name to the dark-blue presentation case (inside cover) for the 1st Class Gold Cross and the presentation sachets (reverse side) for each of the 2nd and 3rd Class Cross.&lt;ref name="EXBT-MC" /&gt;

===Cross reverse side inscription===
Inscribed on the reverse side of the cross, of which two official reverse-side styles exist, is the inscription ''Das Kind adelt die Mutter''&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt; (The Child ennobles the Mother) found on the initial version produced on inception during the early part of 1939.&lt;ref name="AUTH-NIM"&gt;{{Cite book |last = [[:de:Jörg Nimmergut|Nimmergut, Feder, von der Heyde]] |first = |authorlink = |title = Deutsche Orden und Ehrenzeichen : Drittes Reich, DDR und Bundesrepublik; 1933 bis heute; (mit den Orden der deutschen Bundesländer nach 1945) (In English: German Orders and Honours : Third Reich, DDR and Federal Republic; 1933 to present; (including the Orders of the German Federal States after 1945) |publisher = Battenburg Verlag in der H.

Dezember 1938''.&lt;ref name="AUTH-NIM" /&gt; Directly beneath each of the two styles is the inscribed [[facsimile]] signature of Adolf Hitler; a style variation in this signature exists between the initial and succeeding version produced.&lt;ref name="EXBT-MC" /&gt;

===Neck ribbon===
The decoration is worn around the neck on its accompanying narrow blue and white [[ribbon]]&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt; of circa 60–70&amp;nbsp;cm in length. No other format of wear or placement was permitted.&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ID-MC"&gt;'''Statutory Document of the Deutsches Reich:''' Official Identification Document (''Ausweis'') of the Cross of Honour of the German Mother – Reverse-Side Instructions Protocol for the Wear of the Crosses of Honour (''Merkblatt über das Tragen der Ehrenkreuze'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deed of Conferral and identification documents===
Accompanying the decoration was a [[deed]] of conferral (''Besitzzeugnis''&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt; otherwise ''Verleihungsurkunde'') sealed with the ''Hoheitszeichen des Deutschen Reiches'' (Great Seal of the German Reich)&lt;ref&gt;'''Statutory Legislation of the Deutsches Reich:''' Verordnung über das Hoheitszeichen des Reichs vom 5. März 1936 (Reichsgestezbl. I S. 1287).&lt;/ref&gt; and the facsimile signature of Adolf Hitler and facsimile [[Countersign (legal)|countersignature]] of the [[Minister of State]] [[Otto Meißner]], head of the Office of the [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|President of Germany]] (''Präsidialkanzlei'').&lt;ref name="DFNG-MC" /&gt; An official pale-blue photo identification document (''Ausweis'') was also available, this identified the holder and attested the bestowal of the decoration to the recipient mother, as well as provided instructions on the reverse side for correct wearing of the decoration, permitted at all "formal" state, celebrative and family occasions only.&lt;ref name="ID-MC" /&gt;

===Miniature of the Mother’s Cross===
[[File:Deutsches Reich Miniature Format Mother's Cross of Honour.jpg|thumb|Illustration: Optional semi-official approved miniature version of the Mother's Cross measuring circa 2cm, with attached ribbon bow, as depicted in the original supply catalogue produced by LDO-approved medal maker Boerger &amp; Co., (Beco) of Berlin.]]
An optional semi-official approved miniature version of the Mother's Cross measuring circa 2&amp;nbsp;cm with reverse-side inscription, attached to a blue-white ribbon bow, was also produced in each of its three classes; it was authorized for purposes of general everyday wear only.&lt;ref name="ID-MC" /&gt; The wearing of the blue-white ribbon bow alone, without the miniature cross attached, was also authorized for same purpose.&lt;ref name="ID-MC" /&gt; The miniature was an optional supplement, that could be purchased privately from relevant authorized supply stockists such as high-street jewellers or directly from the LDO (''Leistungsgemeinschaft der Deutschen Ordenshersteller'') approved medal makers responsible for manufacturing private retail supply.&lt;ref name="ID-MC" /&gt; Other formats made available by those manufacturers to recipients of the honour, such as [[brooch]]es, were simply unofficial merchandising embellishments.&lt;ref name="AUTH-NIM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ID-MC" /&gt;

===Legacy===
The Mother's Cross of Honour, upon the death of the honoured recipient mother, was permitted by statute to remain inheritable with the bereaved family as a keepsake remembrance.&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt;

==Nomination and conditions of conferral==

===Ideology===
The Cross of Honour of the German Mother represented the fundamental ideologies of the role of the mother (the role of women under [[National Socialism]]) and [[ethnic]]-[[nationalism]] (the ''[[Völkisch movement]]'') of that time period in Germany.&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-MM" /&gt; Its inception followed the earlier "Roaring Twenties" or "[[Roaring Twenties|golden 1920s]]" as it was later referred in Europe and a period during Germany's [[Weimar Republic]], which saw young women breaking with traditional "[[mores]]" or likewise step aside from "traditional" [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] patterns.&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-MM" /&gt;

===Nomination===
A recommendation presented collectively at the beginning of each month to the ''Präsidialkanzlei der Ordenskanzlei''&lt;ref name="DFNG-MC" /&gt; (Presidential Chancellery of the Chancellery of Honours) in [[Berlin]] for the Mother's Cross honour, could only be instigated by the local [[mayor]]’s office, or on application from the ''Ortsgruppenleiter'' (local political [[Party leader]]) of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (NSDAP), or the ''Kreiswart des Reichsbundes der Kinderreichen'' (District Warden of the [[Reichsbund der Kinderreichen|Reichs Union of Children-rich]] families).&lt;ref name="DFNG-MC" /&gt;

===Eligibility, criteria and bureaucratic process===
The nomination involved a lengthy and exhaustive bureaucratic process. Not only were certain characteristics of the mother observed and eligibility studied thoroughly, but those too leading to the [[grandparents]].&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AN-MC"&gt;'''Formal Document of the Deutsches Reich:''' Public exhibit – official government issued document: “Erklärung zum Antrag auf Verleihung des Ehrenkreuzes für kinderreiche Mütter” (In English: Declaration to the Application for the bestow of the Cross of Honour for children-rich Mothers)&lt;/ref&gt; The conferral of the Mother’s Cross was so highly regarded by the government in Berlin, that additional bureaucratic resources assigned to lesser civil and military decorations were pulled for the exhaustive administrative procedures that this decoration alone required.&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt; Its precedence especially during Germany’s wartime period saw all other civil honours and decorations but the Mother’s Cross temporarily suspended since the original purpose for its establishment was now more significant.&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt; Local government agencies such as the Social Welfare Agency (''Wohlfahrtsamt''), Public Health Department (''Gesundheitsamt''), Youth Welfare Agency (''Jugendamt''), Police (''Polizei'') and other government agencies were all consulted in the eligibility investigation process.&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt; The decoration could and was only to be bestowed to the most honourable proven mothers.&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt; Accordingly, the following legislative prerequisites were to be strictly met:

* a) that both parents of the children were ''deutschblütig'' (of German blood-[[heredity]]) and genetically-fit,&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt;
* b) that the mother of the decoration was indeed "worthy" of the decoration,&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt; and
* c) that the children were [[Live birth (human)|live births]].&lt;ref name="STZG-MC" /&gt;

In some detail, these criteria required, for example:

* I). Evidence to be provided by the mother in the form of a signed declaration "that the mother – and her husband – is/are ''deutschblütig'' (of German blood-heredity), that their four grandparents are not of [[Jews|Jewish]] or other foreign ethnic origin, nor have ever belonged or subscribed to the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]],&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AN-MC" /&gt; and in circumstances where the husband or marriage is deceased – confirms further that no contradictory facts are known in believing the ''Deutschblütigkeit'' (German bloodline) of the former husband".&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AN-MC" /&gt; Unless doubts were cast to suggest otherwise in the validity of the declaration given, it was to be accepted as sufficient.&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt;
* II). The mother was indeed "worthy" of the decoration (I.e. proven an honourable mother of reputable moral standing, genetically healthy and genetically-fit.&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt; With no evidence of prior confinement to a state penitentiary (''Zuchthaus''), [[extramarital sex|marital infidelity]], unlawful [[abortion]], or any other personal burdens of [[taboo]] or social offences such as [[prostitution]] or promiscuous behaviour, intimate interracial relationships ([[miscegenation]]) or otherwise [[exogamy]], amongst other criteria that were required to be investigated and evidenced by government authorities).&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt;
* III). Further conditions observed, involving the entire family, were that the children are clear of hereditary illnesses or [[genetic disorders]], that a conscious responsibility exists without supervision in the parents being mindful of maintaining the family home to acceptable orderly standards and to nurturing their children towards being useful compatriots.&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt; The husband had not served a prison sentence, the family were not conceiving a great number of dependants (children) as a form of subsistence for the receipt of significant monetary disbursements of state [[child benefit|child support]] (''Kinderbeihilfe'') and thereby feel entitled to avoid regular employment in exploiting such lifestyle, the family members were not chronic [[alcoholics]], work-shy nor had conflicts with the law and police or presented other social delinquencies, and the family were not burdening private or public social [[welfare]] aid.&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt;

In the event the authorities were to find such discrepancies during their investigations leading to non-eligibility, the family risked being regarded or stigmatised as "asozial" ([[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]]) or [[dysfunctional]], which at that time was viewed as a risk and threat for the wellbeing of the German nation. It was declared inconceivable and abhorrent to consider or recommend any mother of such a family background for the Mother's Cross honour.&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AN-MC" /&gt; In a further extract from the official application screening protocol,&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt; the local mayor's office was also encouraged, if his office was recommending a mother, to consider whether the mother in question, who has gifted her children life, has borne children likely to bear sacrifices in the interest of preserving the German nation, or whether the children posed a burden and peril to the future of the German nation, and the children perhaps should have better remained unborn.&lt;ref name="MEBT-MC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AN-MC" /&gt;

===Benefits and privileges===
Various privileges were bound to the honour, one example being preferential treatment, precedence and priority service within society and public services.&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-HKEB"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Hilder Kammer |author2=Elisabet Bartsch |title = Jugendlexikon Nationalsozialismus – Begriffe aus der Zeit der Gewaltherrschaft 1933–1945 (In English: Youth-Glossary National Socialism – Terminology from the era of dictatorship 1933–1945) |publisher = [[Rowohlt Verlag|Rowohlt Verlag GmbH]] |series = Sachbuch, Geschichte, Zeitgeschichte (In English: Fact Book, History, Contemporary History) |year = 2007 |location = Berlin |language = German |url = http://www.rowohlt.de/buch/Elisabet_Bartsch_Jugendlexikon_Nationalsozialismus.2377229.html |isbn = 978-3-499-62335-6 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one recount recalls "…they were always given the best of everything: housing, food, clothing, and schooling for their children. Old people even had to give up their seats on the bus or [[tram|streetcar]]. They were treated like royalty with the greatest respect. No standing in line for them. At the butchers shop the best cuts of meat would go into their baskets. A helper or nurse was assigned by the government to help them take care of the brood and arrived first thing in the morning".&lt;ref name="AUTH-HKEB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AUTH-ESCHDR"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Ella E. Schneider Hilton |author2=Angela K. Hilton |title= Displaced Person: A Girl's Life in Russia, Germany, and America. |publisher = [[Louisiana State University Press]] |series = |year = 2006 |location = USA |language = |url = http://lsupress.org/books/detail/displaced-person/ |isbn = 978-0-8071-3192-3 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Annuity (European financial arrangements)|annuity]] was also considered for a recipient mother of the decoration, but due to government budget constraints, this proved unworkable. Members of the [[Hitler Youth]] organization were also instructed; a wearer of the Mother's Cross was to be honourably greeted (saluted) when encountered. The ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' (People's Observer) national newspaper (1938 Issue No. 25) stated: "…the holder of the Mother’s Cross of Honour will in future enjoy all types of privileges that we by nature have accustomed to our nation's honoured comrades and our injured war veterans."&lt;ref&gt;[[Völkischer Beobachter]], Nr. 25, 1938. (Original German text: ''"die Trägerinnen des Mütterehrenkreuzes werden in Zukunft alle jene Bevorzugungen genießen, die uns gegenüber den verdienten Volksgenossen und gegenüber Kriegsbeschädigten bereits Selbstverständlichkeit geworden sind."'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annulment of recognition ===
The receipt of the decoration was no guarantee of permanent recognition, it could be annulled on a case-by-case basis under certain circumstances on the advice of the ''Reichsminister des Innern'' (Reichs-[[Interior ministry|Minister of Interior]]).&lt;ref name="DFNG-MC" /&gt; For instance, it could be annulled if the mother ceased to be "worthy" by neglecting her children, marital infidelity, or exhibited other problematic behaviour.

==Recipients==

===Public presentation ceremonies===
The first public presentation ceremonies, following inception of the Mother's Cross in December 1938, were held on Mother's Day 21 May 1939&lt;ref&gt;[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]], 8. Aufl., Bd. 8, Sp. 14 – Muttertag (In English: 8th Edition, Book 8, Column 14 – Mother’s Day)&lt;/ref&gt; across Germany. However, due to the unexpected high number of mothers eligible for the decoration across all classes on its inception, despite a stringent nomination criteria, resulted in the initial presentations being restricted to mothers of age 60 and above due to various administrative and logistics limitations.&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt; The first year presentations were also extended to include 1 October 1939  "[[harvest festival]]" day (''Erntedankfest''), equivalent to [[thanksgiving]], and 24 December 1939 [[Christmas Eve]].&lt;ref name="EXBT3-MC"&gt;Sighted public exhibits of government issued deeds' of conferral (''Besitzeugnis/Verleihungsurkunde'') to recipient mothers of the Mother’s Cross honour in year 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until Mother's Day 1940 onwards that eligible mothers aged below 60 were finally presented with their Mother's Cross decoration and once again these presentations were deferred until a later date that same year.&lt;ref name="AUTH-IW" /&gt; A recipient mother who could not attend her official invitation to a local public presentation ceremony received her decoration delivered through the postal service. Some presentation ceremonies were also recorded filmed events chronicled by the ''[[Die Deutsche Wochenschau]]'' (The German Weekly Newsreel).&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Archive, Short Format Films – [https://archive.org/details/1944-05-31-Die-Deutsche-Wochenschau-Nr.717 Die Deutsche Wochenschau (The German Weekly Newsreel), Archive – 31 May 1944 Film No. 717, Mother’s Cross presentations by a ''Gauleiter'' in the region Steiermark (Styria), Austria].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Total decorations conferred===
Exact total decorations bestowed throughout its existence are no longer traceable through the limited official records that survived the [[World War II|Second World War]], the central application archives held at the ''Präsidialkanzlei'' (Presidential Chancellery) in Berlin were lost or otherwise destroyed by closing war events, however, it's estimated that up until September 1941 there were a total of 4.7 million recipient mothers honoured with the Mother's Cross decoration.&lt;ref name="AUTH-WB" /&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
After the end of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1945, the Mother's Cross was occasionally referred to as the ''Mütterverdienstkreuz'' (Mother's Cross of Merit). The Mother's Cross, however, belongs to the decorations and medals bestowed during the Third Reich era of Germany, and as such, incorporates by design the adopted swastika symbol; the wearing or display of which in public places, especially in Germany of such decorations since 26 July 1957, is restricted and regulated by German law (Ref. Bundesgesetzblatt (BGBl) I, 1957, S. 844, §6) in accordance with the succeeding ''[[Ordensgesetz|Law on Titles, Orders and Honours]]'' of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Gesetz über Titel, Orden und Ehrenzeichen'').&lt;ref name="LAW-BGB1"&gt;{{Cite book |last = [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] |first = |authorlink = |title = Gesetz über Titel, Orden und Ehrenzeichen (OrdenG).

'''''Dei Filius''''' is the [[incipit]] of the [[dogmatic constitution]] of the [[First Vatican Council]] on the [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]], which was adopted unanimously, and issued by [[Pope Pius IX]] on 24 April 1870.

The constitution set forth the teaching of "the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church" on God, revelation and faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/V1.htm Roberto De Mattei, John Laughland, ''Pius IX''], p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The papal bull was influenced by the work of [[Johann Baptist Franzelin]], papal theologian to the council and later cardinal, who had written a great deal on the topic of faith and rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.v.ii.i.html#v.ii.i-p21.5|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes. Volume II. The History of Creeds.|work=ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document begins by observing that "...God, the principle and end of all things, can be known with certainty by the natural light of human reason from created things".&lt;ref&gt;Pope Pius IX, ''Dei Filius'', Chapter II&lt;/ref&gt; However, it then explains that there are other divine truths, the knowledge of which is necessary for salvation, that are beyond the power of natural reason and can only be known through divine revelation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.avemaria.edu/post/34174093550/vatican-i-and-gods-natural-knowability Trabbic, Joseph G., "Vatican I and God’s natural knowability", October 23, 2012, Ave Maria University]&lt;/ref&gt;

It also decreed, "If any one shall not receive as sacred and canonical the books of Holy Scripture, entire with all their parts, as the holy Synod of Trent has enumerated them, or shall deny that they have been divinely inspired: let him be anathema."&lt;ref&gt;''Dei Filius'', Canon 4&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Name used for the church==
The draft presented to the council on 8 March 1870 drew no serious criticism. But a group of 35 English-speaking bishops, who feared that the opening phrase "Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia" might be construed as favouring the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[branch theory]], raised objections to this expression, "Holy Roman Catholic Church". They proposed that the word "Roman" be omitted out of concern that use of the term "Roman Catholic" would lend support to proponents of branch theory. While the council overwhelmingly rejected this proposal, the text was finally modified to read "The Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Avery Dulles]] |title=The Catholicity of the Church |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1987 |ISBN=0-19-826695-2 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia" were voted on three separate dates. On the first occasion, when this chapter alone was considered, two votes concerned the opening words. The first was on a proposal by a few English-speaking bishops to delete the word "Romana", thus changing "Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia" (The Holy Roman Catholic Church) to "Sancta Catholica Ecclesia" (The Holy Catholic Church). This was overwhelmingly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Faber. Katholizismus in Geschichte und Gegenwart. 2005, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodorus Granderath. Constitutiones Dogmaticae Sancrosancti Oecumenici Concilii Vaticani. (Herder 1892), p. 5 indicates that the vote was overwhelming. Granderath's book was called "one of the most important contributions to the literature of dogmatic theology in our day" in a review in the ''American Ecclesiastical Review''.[https://books.google.com/books?id=7nwoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=%22THEODORO+GRANDERATH%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4GaDbbijJp&amp;sig=gxjUJKRbUC4TC-H-0ggKSWcxQOo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BW-uScrtGJuqMqm_1eQE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA157,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second vote, held immediately afterwards, was on a proposal to insert a comma, so that "Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia" (The Holy Roman Catholic Church) would become "Sancta Romana, Catholica Ecclesia" (The Holy Roman, Catholic Church). This too was defeated, though not as overwhelmingly as the first proposal.

In a later vote, held on 12 April 1870, the text as a whole, which preserved the same opening words, was approved with 515 affirmative votes (''placet'') and no opposing votes (''non placet''); but there were 83 ''placet iuxta modum'' votes, asking for retouches, many of them regarding the opening words of chapter I.&lt;ref&gt;Granderath, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lacoste&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nzTkg_A6CWkC Jean-Yves Lacoste, Encyclopedia of Christian Theology: G - O] (CRC Press, 2005 {{ISBN|1-57958-250-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57958-250-0}}), p. 1666&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the reservations thus expressed, the text presented for a final vote and approved unanimously on 24 April changed the order of the words and added "Apostolica", so that "Sancta Romana Catholica Ecclesia" became "Sancta Catholica Apostolica Romana Ecclesia" (The Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church).&lt;ref name=Lacoste/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granderath, pp. 29-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lacoste | first = Jean-Yves |chapter=Vatican I, Council of| title = Encyclopedia of Christian Theology | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-57958-250-8|page=1666|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzTkg_A6CWkC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="498">'''Delegated authority''' is an [[authority]] obtained from another that has authority since the authority does not naturally exist.

Typically this is used in a government context where an organization that is created by a legitimate government, such as a Board, City, Town or other Public Corporations to allow them to legally function in the name of the constitutional government.

'''Don Richard Riso''' (17 January 1946 – August 30, 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.streamsend.com/ss/1/TauY/2302idaf8q Enneagram Institute announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American teacher of the [[Enneagram of Personality]]; his books have been translated into several languages. Riso considered himself to be Enneagram type Four with a Three wing, although he did not actually disclose his type in his book ''Personality Types''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.webring.com/people/cl/lifexplore/enfame.htm|title=Famous People by Enneagram Type According to Don Richard Riso|publisher=Webspace.webring.com|accessdate=2012-09-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606094806/http://webspace.webring.com/people/cl/lifexplore/enfame.htm|archivedate=2012-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Riso grew up in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He studied English and [[philosophy]] and received a [[Master's degree|M.A.]] from [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/bios.asp|title=Biographies of Don Riso, Russ Hudson &amp; Faculty of The Enneagram Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Archive.org|accessdate=2017-01-25|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213031700/http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/bios.asp|archivedate=2012-12-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1962,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} he joined the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits) of the New Orleans Province, but later left the order without being [[ordained]].

==Enneagram work==
In the early 1970s, some members of the [[Jesuit]] order came in contact with the Enneagram material and it began to be taught in Jesuit and other [[Roman Catholic]] institutions in North America. In 1974, as a Jesuit seminarian in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], Riso first learned of the Jesuit teaching on the Enneagram which, he has said, "consisted of nine one-page impressionistic sketches of the personality types"&lt;ref&gt;Don Richard Riso, Russ Hudson; ''Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1996, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and fascinated him. In the following year, 1975, he left the order and began developing the brief type sketches to more detailed descriptions.

Riso developed a number of original ideas regarding understanding the Enneagram, such as nine "levels of development" from "redeemed" or "healthy" to "totally unhealthy" and the "harmonic groups".

In 1987, Riso published his 12 years of Enneagram thinking in his first book, ''Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery''. This work showed the influence of [[Carl Gustav Jung]] and also of [[Karen Horney]]. Three years later he published ''Understanding the Enneagram''.

In 1991, Russ Hudson joined Riso, originally to create a questionnaire for indicating people's Enneagram types. The result was the [[Riso–Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator]] (RHETI). Several versions have since been developed, the present complete version consisting of 144 pairs of forced-choice statements.&lt;!-- online version 2.5--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/Tests_Battery.asp#RHETI |title=Guide to Riso-Hudson Personality Tests |publisher=Enneagraminstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118173621/http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/Tests_Battery.asp#RHETI |archivedate=2015-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Riso and Hudson founded the Enneagram Institute in [[New York City]]. The institute has since moved to [[Stone Ridge, New York]], where it offers workshops and trainings as well as publishing materials pertaining to the Enneagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/aboutus.asp |title=About The Enneagram Institute |publisher=Enneagraminstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920113007/http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/aboutus.asp |archivedate=2012-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is represented by the Enneagram Institute Network in more than 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/network.asp#us |title=The Enneagram Institute Network |publisher=Enneagraminstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118173703/http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/network.asp#us |archivedate=2015-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson participated in revising the book ''Personality Types'' for the second edition, which came out in 1996.

==Death==
Riso died on August 30, 2012, from [[metastasize]]d [[pancreatic cancer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5343">'''Editio Critica Maior (ECM)''' is a critical edition of the Greek New Testament being produced by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (Eng. "Institute for New Testament Textual Research") -which is famous for [[Kurt Aland|Kurt Aland's]] [[Novum Testamentum Graece|'''Nestle-Aland - Novum Testament Graece''']] e.g.- in collaboration with other international institutes. The 'ECM' documents the history of the Greek text through the first millennium on the basis of Greek manuscripts, old translations, and New Testament citations in ancient Christian literature that are of significance to the history of transmission. On the basis of genealogical investigations of the material, first prepared with this completeness, the original text of the [[Greek New Testament]] is reconstructed.
The Editio Critica Maior project is supported by the [[Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities]]. It is to be completed by the year 2030.

== The beginnings ==
Since the founding of the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (INTF) in 1959 by Kurt Aland, manuscripts – some of which had previously been unknown or lost, were traced and photographed, and all known manuscripts were photographed and cataloged. The INTF thus acquired over 90% of the known material on microfilm or photo.

== First evaluation ==
In the mid-1980s, a text program was developed. Uniform texts, which, as is well known, constituted the main part in the transmission of the high-middle age – have been dropped out. After the elimination of these texts, the material that is relevant to the textual history of the first millennium is now available: in addition to the manuscripts of this period, the numerous among later manuscripts, which reflect the older textual history. 
The (still) very high number of relevant manuscripts is gradually transcribed and subjected to a complete text comparison (Vollkollation). The results are recorded in databases. For the first time this allows a computer-assisted exploration of the entire material. Above all, the acquisition of genealogical data is important, which illuminates the textual history and especially its beginnings. 

== The digitization ==
The institute uses digital methods at all levels of its philological work: handwriting is captured in the highest possible quality as digital photos. These photos are the basis for the transcriptions to be made on the computer. Additionally digitized material from other institutes is taken into consideration. The software Collate is then used to prepare the critical edition. 

== The result ==
In 1997 the first installment of this edition was published by [[Barbara Aland]]. The ''Catholic Letters'' and also ''The Acts of the Apostels'' are available printed and digitally (by using the [[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]]). In cooperation with the [[International Greek New Testament Project]], the ''Johannesevangelium'' is in preparation. In addition an edition, that has been published in printed form, a digital platform - the [[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]] has been developed, which allows online access to all data collected during the work on the ECM. This includes above all the diplomatic transcripts of all the manuscripts used in the ECM and the databases on which the ECM is based on. 
The recent editions of ''Nestle-Aland'' in the 28th edition and the 5th edition of the ''Greek New Testament'' of the ''United Bible Societies'' are in the text after the ECM, as far as it has been published so far.

==Current editions==
The ''Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior'' is published by [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]] (the German Bible Society).

==Contemporary issues==
Modern issues within environmental philosophy include but are not restricted to the concerns of environmental activism as well as the questions raised by environmental science and technology. These include issues related to the depletion of finite resources and other harmful and permanent effects brought on to the environment by humans, as well as the ethical and practical problems raised by philosophies and practices of environmental conservation, restoration, and policy in general. A haunting question that has settled on the minds of modern environmental philosophers is "Do rivers have rights?"&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, 2012. "Environmental philosophy: from theory to practice," Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, West Sussex.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time environmental philosophy deals with the value human beings attach to different kinds of environmental experience, particularly how experiences in or close to non-human environments contrast with urban or industrialized experiences, and how this varies across cultures.

==Modern history==
Environmental Philosophy re-emerged as a major social movement in the 1970s. The movement was an attempt to connect with humanity's sense of alienation from nature in a continuing fashion throughout history.&lt;ref name="Weston 1999"&gt;Weston, 1999. "An Invitation to Environmental Philosophy," Oxford University Press, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This was very closely related to the development at the same time of ecofeminism, an intersecting discipline. Since then its areas of concern have expanded significantly.

The field is today characterized by a notable diversity of stylistic, philosophical and cultural approaches to human environmental relationships, from personal and poetic reflections on environmental experience and arguments for [[panpsychism]] to Malthusian applications of game theory or the question of how to put an economic value on nature's services. A major debate arose in the 1970s and 80s was that of whether nature has intrinsic value in itself independent of human values or whether its value is merely instrumental, with ecocentric or deep ecology approaches emerging on the one hand versus consequentialist or pragmatist anthropocentric approaches on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another debate that arose at this time was the debate over whether there really is such a thing as wilderness or not, or whether it is merely a [[cultural construct]] with colonialist implications. Since then, readings of environmental history and discourse have become more critical and refined. In this ongoing debate, a diversity of dissenting voices have emerged from different cultures across the globe questioning the dominance of Western assumptions, helping to transform the field.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott &amp; Nelson, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, there has been a significant challenge to deep ecology and the concepts of nature that underlie it, some arguing that there is not really such a thing as nature at all beyond some self-contradictory and even politically dubious constructions of an ideal other that ignore the real human-environmental interactions that shape our world and lives.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, 1999; Keulartz, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been alternately dubbed the postmodern, constructivist, and most recently post-naturalistic turn in environmental philosophy. Environmental aesthetics, design and restoration have emerged as important intersecting disciplines that keep shifting the boundaries of environmental thought, as have the science of climate change and biodiversity and the ethical, political and epistemological questions they raise. Today, environmental philosophy is a burgeoning and increasingly relevant field.

===Deep ecology movement===
{{Main|Deep ecology}}

In 1984, George Sessions and [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]] articulated the principles of the new Deep Ecology Movement.&lt;ref&gt;Drengson, Inoue, 1995. "The Deep Ecology Movement," North Atlantic Books, Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt;
These basic principles are:
* The well-being and flourishing of human and non-human life have value.
* Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.
* Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs.
* The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease in the human population.
* Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.
* Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.
* The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent value), rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between big and great.
* Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.

'''Hedone''' was the personification and goddess of pleasure, enjoyment, and delight. Hedone, also known as [[Voluptas]] in Roman mythology, is the daughter of the Greek gods [[Eros]] (Cupid) and [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]]. She was associated more specifically with sensual pleasure. Her opposites were the [[Algos]], personifications of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedone|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Hedone.html|website=Theoi Greek Mythology|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hēdonē'' ({{lang|grc|ἡδονή}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning [[pleasure]], and is the root of the English word "[[wikt:hedonism|hedonism]]". In the [[Epicureanism|philosophy]] of [[Epicurus]], hēdonē is described as a pleasure that may or may not derive from actions that are virtuous, whereas another form of pleasure, ''terpsis'', is always virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=James|title=Epicurus and Democritean ethics : an archaeology of ataraxia|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

'''Henricus Reneri''' or '''Renerius''' (1593, [[Huy]] – 20 March 1639, [[Utrecht]]) was a Dutch&lt;ref&gt;Reneri was born at Huy in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, but half of his life he lived in the Dutch Republic. Furthermore, he is included in ''The Dictionary of Seventeenth and Eighteenth-Century Dutch Philosophers''. Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 824–826.&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher.

== Life ==
Reneri was born at Huy in the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] in 1593. He studied [[liberal arts]] at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] and attended the Grand [[seminary|Séminaire]] of [[Liège]]. After his conversion to [[Calvinism]] in 1616 he went to the [[Dutch Republic]]. He studied theology at the [[Collège Wallon]] at Leiden, but he broke off his studies in 1621. The following ten years Reneri worked as a private [[tutor]] to the children of several Amsterdam merchant-regents, including [[Adriaan Pauw]]. In the meantime he studied medicine at [[Leiden University]]. In 1631 he found a position as professor of philosophy at the illustrious school of [[Deventer]], the Illustre Gymnasium. From 1634 he held the same chair at the newly founded illustrious school of [[Utrecht]], which was raised to the status of [[Utrecht University|university]] in 1636. He died only three years later, at the age of 46.

Reneri mainly taught [[Second scholasticism|scholastic]] logic and natural philosophy. Apart from his professorship, he worked on a method of his own in the [[Ramist]] tradition. This method met especially with much enthusiasm within the Hartlib circle, the European network around the English [[pansophist]] [[Samuel Hartlib]]. Furthermore, Reneri was engaged in experiments and inventions in the fields of [[History of optics#Renaissance and early modern optics|optics]], [[Thermometer#Development|thermometers]], [[water clocks]], [[alchemy]] and [[natural magic]].

Reneri was one of the best friends of [[René Descartes]] and an admirer of his philosophy. They met during the winter of 1628-1629 and Descartes followed Reneri to Deventer and Utrecht. Reneri is reported to have read the [[Discourse on the Method|''Discours de la Méthode'']] and the accompanying ''Essais'' (including [[La Géométrie]]) publicly in his classes.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Claude Saumaise]] to [[Ismaël Boulliau]], 7 March 1638. Charles Adam and [[Paul Tannery]]. ed. (1996). ''Oeuvres de Descartes''. Paris: Vrin, vol. 10, p. 557.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Reneri is not to be regarded as a [[Cartesianism|Cartesian philosopher]], since his works show little Cartesian influences.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Sassen.

"An Unknown Letter From Henricus Reneri to Constantijn Huygens on the Thermometer and the Camera Obscura" In ''Lias'' 37:1, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

What survives are an inaugural address, several [[disputations]] which were presided by him, and a correspondence of more than sixty letters with leading scholars, philosophers, theologians, diplomats and poets from the Republic and abroad, such as [[André Rivet]], [[Constantijn Huygens]], [[Pierre Gassendi]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]].

'''''Hölderlin's Hymn "The Ister"''''' ({{lang-de|Hölderlins Hymne »Der Ister«}}) is the title given to a lecture course delivered by German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]] in 1942. It was first published in 1984 as volume 53 of Heidegger's [[Gesamtausgabe (Heidegger)|''Gesamtausgabe'']]. The translation by [[William McNeill (philosopher)|William McNeill]] and Julia Davis was published in 1996 by [[Indiana University Press]]. ''[[Der Ister (poem)|Der Ister]]'' is a poem by [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], the title of which refers to an ancient name for a part of the [[Danube River]].

==Overview==
In 1942, in the darkest depths of [[World War II]] and the [[National Socialism|National Socialist]] period, Heidegger chose to deliver a lecture course on a single poem by Friedrich Hölderlin: "''Der Ister''," about the river Danube. The course explored the meaning of poetry, the nature of technology, the relationship between [[ancient Greece]] and modern Germany, the essence of politics, and human dwelling. The central third of the lecture course is a reading of [[Sophocles|Sophocles']] [[Antigone (Sophocles)|''Antigone'']]. Heidegger undertakes this reading of ''Antigone'' ostensibly because of the importance of this text for grasping the meaning of Hölderlin's poetry, but in doing so he repeats and extends a reading he had conducted in a different context in 1935. In terms of Heidegger's ''oeuvre'', the 1942 lecture course is significant in that it is Heidegger's most sustained discussion of the essence of politics. Heidegger was only able to deliver two-thirds of the written text of the lecture course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theister.com/keyfigures.html ''The Ister'': A film by David Barison and Daniel Ross] and [[Gesamtausgabe (Heidegger)|Gesamtausgabe]] 53, editor's epilogue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lecture course is divided into three parts.

*'''Part one''' introduces the way in which Heidegger believes it is necessary to approach [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin's]] poetry, arguing against the "metaphysical interpretation of art." He further argues that Hölderlin's poetry must be understood in terms of its essential kinship with the work of Sophocles.
*'''Part two''' retraces the interpretation of Sophocles' ''Antigone'' which Heidegger conducted in the 1935 lecture course, ''An Introduction to Metaphysics''. He extends this reading, modifying it in subtle ways.
*'''Part three''', which was in fact never delivered, returns to Hölderlin's poetry, arguing that the figure of the river in the poem is in fact the poet, and vice versa.

== Part one: Poetising the essence of the rivers ==

===The Ister hymn===
The lecture course opens with a reflection on the Greek origin of the word "[[hymn]]," meaning song of praise, specifically in praise of the gods, the heroes, or contest victors, in preparation of the festival. Heidegger cites a line from Sophocles' ''Antigone'' connecting the noun and verb forms of the word, and then indicates that the sense in which Hölderlin's works are hymns must initially remain an open question.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger turns his attention to the first line of "''Der Ister''"—"Now come, fire!" What could this mean, if "fire" here indicates the sun or the dawn? What could it mean to call, or to have the vocation for such a calling, given that the dawn will come whether it is called or not? And what is meant by "Now," by naming the time of such a calling? From these questions Heidegger is drawn to ask what it means to "poetise," answering that poetising is always inaugurating something, that genuine poetising is always poetising "anew." Thus the "Now" of the first line speaks not only of the present, but toward the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger next focuses on the fact that it is clear that "the rivers come to language" in Hölderlin's poetry. On the one hand, the rivers are detached from human being, having their own "spirit"; on the other hand, the rivers are a locale at which human beings find their dwelling place. The question is thus that of the poetic essence of the river.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The metaphysical interpretation of art===
Rather than delving immediately into this question, Heidegger makes a detour, elaborating the "metaphysical interpretation of art." He argues that metaphysical interpretations are incapable of comprehending Hölderlin's poetry.

According to the metaphysical interpretation, art presents objects in nature such as rivers, but this presentation is at the service of something else, of their "meaning" in the artwork. Heidegger speaks in this regard of the etymology of the words "[[allegory]]" and "[[metaphor]]." The metaphysical interpretation of art relies on the distinction between the sensuous and the non-sensuous, the aesthetic and the noetic, the sensible and the intelligible. And according to this interpretation the artwork exists not for itself, not ''as'' a sensuous object, but ''for'' the nonsensuous and suprasensuous, which is also named "spirit." In this way the superior and the true come to be identified with the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the metaphysical interpretation of art, Heidegger asserts that the rivers in Hölderlin's poetry are in no way symbolic images of a higher or deeper content. He draws attention to the final lines of the poem—"Yet what that one does, that river, / No one knows"—in order to indicate that, whatever the rivers are, or whatever the river does, remains an enigma. Even the poet knows only that the river flows, but not what is ''decided'' in that flowing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locality and journeying===
Heidegger then turns to a consideration of the river as the dwelling place of human beings. As such, the river is what brings human beings into their own and maintains them there. Yet what is their own often remains foreign to human beings for a long time, and can be abandoned by them because it threatens to overwhelm them. It is not something that produces itself, but must come to be appropriate, and needs to be appropriated. The river is of assistance in the becoming-homely of human beings, but this "assistance" is not an occasional support but a steadfast standing by.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand what this means, Heidegger considers some lines from another Hölderlin poem, "Voice of the People," in which the rivers are referred to as "vanishing" and as "full of intimation." That the rivers are vanishing means that they abandon the human landscape, without thereby being unfaithful toward that landscape. Yet as full of intimation, the rivers proceed into what is coming. Thus Heidegger sees Hölderlin as concerned with the temporality of the river in relation to the human, yet also with its spatiality—thus "the river is the journeying." The river is, he says, the journeying of becoming homely or, rather, the very locality attained in and through the journeying.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 27–31.&lt;/ref&gt; His claim is that the river is the locality of the dwelling of human beings as historical upon the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rätsel''===
The river is an enigma (''[[:de:Rätsel|Rätsel]]''). But Heidegger relates this to ''Raten'', giving counsel, and to ''Rat'', counsel, but also "care." To give counsel means to take into care. That the river is an enigma does not mean it is a puzzle we should wish to "solve." Rather, it means it is something we should bring closer to us ''as'' an enigma.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; We must understand this poetry, therefore, in something other than a calculative, technical way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space and time===
Locality and journeying: this sounds like "space and time." Succession takes its course in time, as a sequence of moments, as a "flowing." But this is in fact only an understanding of space and time as an ordered, calculable, relationality. Whatever is subject to order must be posited in advance in such a way that it becomes accessible for order and control. Hence, for example, the reduction to co-ordinates. Yet for calculative observation, something is what it is only through what it performs. All modern thinking thinks in terms of order and performance. Human activity is thought as labour, equated with mechanical energy, and assessed according to the performative principle. Through such thinking space and time come to be considered so obvious as not to require any further thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern technology===
Such modern thinking about space and time is essentially technological. Modern technology is different from every tool. Whereas the tool is a means, what is distinctive about modern technology is that this is no longer the case, and that it is instead unfolding a domination of its own. It demands its own kind of discipline and conquest. Thus, for example, the staged accomplishment of factories built for the purpose of fabricating machine tools for other factories. Modern machine technology is a specific kind of "truth." We may believe that technology, as the control of space and time, is never undertaken without purpose, and is therefore no end in itself. This, however, is a misunderstanding grounded in a failure to grasp the essence of modern technology. And this results from failing to question that which underpins it—the order and unity of "space and time."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger then deconstructs the concepts of space and time, arguing firstly that these cannot be merely "objects," as though they were some gigantic containers in which everything is accommodated. Yet neither can we conclude that they are merely subjective. Is space, over which wars erupt, merely imaginary? And is time, which tears us along and tears us away, merely subjective? Such metaphysical interpretations of space and time will be of no help in understanding the locality and journeying at the heart of Hölderlin's non-metaphysical poetising. Space and time comprise the framework for our calculative domination and ordering of the "world" through technology. But it remains undecided whether this process is turning human beings into mere planetary adventurers, or whether it is the beginning of another tendency, toward new forms of settlement and resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 45–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogue===
According to Heidegger, that poetry of Hölderlin's taking the form of the "hymn" has taken into its care this becoming homely in one's own. He asserts that "one's own" is in this case the German fatherland, but immediately adds that "coming to be at home is thus a passage through the foreign." This is why this poetry necessarily takes the form of a dialogue with foreign poets, specifically, [[Pindar]] and Sophocles. What must be carefully listened to in the hymnal poetry of Hölderlin is this "resonance" of Greek poetry, on which basis Heidegger turns to the interpretation of ''Antigone''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Part two: The Greek interpretation of human beings in Sophocles' ''Antigone'' ==

===The choral ode===
The choral ode from the ''Antigone'' of Sophocles is according to Heidegger the singular work radiating throughout the poetry of Hölderlin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger had previously interpreted this ode in his 1935 lecture course, ''An Introduction to Metaphysics'', and in 1942 he both recapitulates and extends this interpretation.

Like "''Der Ister''," the ode begins with a call to the dawning sun, yet it is clear the ode is equally concerned with darkness. Although the ode is concerned with the light and darkness of human being, this should not be interpreted to mean that the two main figures, Creon and Antigone, form an opposition. Each of these figures proceed from out of the unity of essence and nonessence, but differently in each case.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Deinon''===
The decisive word, according to Heidegger, occurs at the beginning of the ode: ''deinon''. Heidegger translates this as ''das Unheimliche'', the uncanny. Heidegger emphasises what he calls the "counterturning" character of the term. ''Deinon'', he says, means the fearful, the powerful, and the inhabitual. But none of these definitional elements is one-dimensional. As the fearful, the ''deinon'' is also that which, as worthy of honour, can awaken awe. As the powerful, it may be that which looms over us, or that which is merely violent. As the inhabitual, the extraordinary, the extraordinariness of skill, it exceeds the ordinary, but it can do so as that which governs the ordinary and the habitual. As ''das Unheimliche'', ''deinon'' names the unity of all these meanings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 61–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ode names the human being as ''deinon'' in manifold ways, indeed as the ''most'' uncanny being, ''das Unheimlichste''. Heidegger ties this to his prior argument that human beings as poetised by Hölderlin are "unhomely" ("''unheimisch''"), that is, on the way toward becoming homely. The extraordinariness of human being is this being un-homely that is also a becoming homely. Heidegger makes clear that this being unhomely does not mean simply homelessness, wandering around, adventurousness, or lack of rootedness. Rather, it means that the sea and the land are those realms that human beings transform through skillfulness and use. The homely is that which is striven for in the violent activity of passing through the inhabitual. Yet even so, the homely is not attained in this activity: as the ode says, man "comes to nothing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 68–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Poros''===
Human being is thus the being which finds passage through everything, yet always comes up short, expressed in the couple ''pantoporos aporos'', where ''poros'' means that irruption of power that finds its way through. Infinitely skillful and artful, human beings nevertheless can never circumvent death. This is something known by human beings, but mostly in the form of evading this knowledge. Human beings are in fact those beings which comport themselves to beings as such, and because they understand being, human beings alone can also forget being. The uncanniness of human beings is that they alone are capable of "catastrophe," in the sense of a reversal turning them away from their own essence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 74–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Polis''===
Heidegger next turns to the couple ''hypsipolis apolis'', "towering high above the site," and "forfeiting the site." This couple is based in the word ''[[polis]]'', and Heidegger notes that, if this is the ''origin'' of the word "political," then it is a mistake to understand the former on the basis of the latter—the ''polis'' is precisely not a political concept. The "political" is conventionally understood in terms of consciousness, in a "technical" manner, as the way in which history is accomplished. It is thus marked by a failure to question itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 79–80, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger asks whether the ''polis'' might not be the name of that realm which constantly becomes questionable anew and remains worthy of question. Perhaps the ''polis'' is that around which everything question-worthy and uncanny turns in an exceptional way. Heidegger uses the word ''Wirbel'', swirl, in this context, and speaks of the ''polis'' as essentially "polar." The pre-political essence of the ''polis'', that which makes possible everything which we call political, is the open site from out of which all human relations toward beings are determined.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human being===
It is thus the essence of human being to both ascend within their site and to be without site. Human being bears within it this potential for reversal, a potential essentially grounded in the possibility of being mistaken, of taking nonbeings for beings and beings for nonbeings. Thus human beings are creatures of risk. They seek to become homely within a site, place everything at stake in this, and encounter the fact that the homely refuses itself to them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the uncanniness of human being, and this is why ''deinon'' does not mean simply power and violence. Human beings do not themselves make themselves the most uncanny thing; it is not a matter of self-consciousness here. Only because human beings can say "it is," Heidegger says, can they say "I am." And only because they have a relation to being can they "say" at all, that is, can they be [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ''zoon logon echon''. It is the distinction of human beings, in other words, to "see" the open.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antigone===
The closing words of the ode speak of the expulsion of the most uncanny from the hearth. If we were to interpret this as a rejection of Creon, according to Heidegger, then the choral ode would not be a "high song of culture" so much as a song in praise of mediocrity, of hatred toward the exception. To interpret otherwise than this means asking where Antigone herself stands in relation to the ''deinon''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 92–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introductory dialogue between Antigone and Ismene, Ismene tries to dissuade her sister from her resolution to bury their brother. Antigone's "pursuit" is, she says, concerned with that against which nothing can avail. Antigone, in other words, takes the impossible as her point of departure. She says herself that she wishes to suffer or bear the uncanny. In this she is removed from all human possibilities, and is the supreme uncanny.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The hearth===
What, then, of the hearth? The chorus speaks not only of expulsion, but of "not sharing their delusion with my knowing." All knowledge of the ''deinon'' is sustained and guided by that knowing which knows the hearth. The content of this knowing is not stated directly, but it is, however, referred to as a ''phronein'', a meditating from the heart. If this knowledge takes the form of intimation, it is not mere opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 105–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

If mythology is not simply an "immature" invention, then thinking stands in an essential relation to poetising. Thinking is not the sediment left after the demythologising of myth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Such reflections are intended by Heidegger to assist in the following gesture: the assertion that the hearth, named by the chorus, is being. "Being is the hearth."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; He then cites Plato on [[Hestia]], the goddess named for the hearth. The expulsion referred to in the closing words of the choral ode is not a rejection of the unhomely, as much as an impulsion to be attentive to the homely, to risk belonging to it. Being unhomely is a not yet awakened, not yet decided, potential for being homely. This is Antigone's supreme action.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The purest poem===
In Heidegger's translation, what determines this action is stated by Antigone as being beyond both the upper and lower gods, beyond [[Zeus]] and [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]], but neither can it be any human ordinance. Hence at stake in her action is the most uncanny risk. The closing words of the ode call in the direction of a knowledge of the proper essence of the unhomely one. In this most enigmatic part of his interpretation, Heidegger speaks of "the risk of distinguishing and deciding between that being unhomely proper to human beings and a being unhomely that is inappropriate." To be this risk is Antigone's essence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 116–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Heidegger concludes that to understand the truth of ''Antigone'', it is necessary to think beyond the cult of the dead or the cult of blood-relatedness, which seem at first glance to be the motors of the tragedy. Antigone, he says, is herself the purest poem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Poetising is neither finding nor inventing, but a telling finding of being, revealing that which is always already revealed, the nearest of all that is near. The human potential for being, and the unhomely being homely of human beings upon the earth, is poetic. What is spoken in the choral ode remains indeterminate, but neither vague nor arbitrary. The indeterminate is, on the contrary, that which is undecided yet first to be decided. If this is the case, then the tragedy poetises that which is in the highest sense worthy of poetising. And this may be why this ode came to speak ever anew to the poet Hölderlin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 119–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part three: Hölderlin's poetising of the essence of the poet as demigod==

===One's own and the foreign===
Sophocles' ode and Hölderlin's river hymns poetise the Same, yet they are not identical. To understand this, Heidegger turns to Hölderlin's famous letter to [[:de:Casimir Ulrich Boehlendorff|Casimir Boehlendorff]], which thematises the relations between Germany and Greece. According to Heidegger's reading, what for the Greeks is their own is what is foreign to the Germans, and what is foreign to the Germans is what is proper to the Greeks. Hölderlin is the first to experience poetically that becoming homely means being unhomely, thus to understand the need of being unhomely, which he does by venturing into an encounter with the (Greek) foreign.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 123–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirit===
Heidegger then cites Hölderlin: "namely at home is spirit / not at the commencement, not at the source." He asks: who is "spirit"? Despite the influence of German metaphysics, Heidegger argues that Hölderlin's use of this word was singular, as that which is alongside itself in thinking itself, and always as "communal" spirit. What spirit thinks is that which is fittingly destined for human beings, yet this is always that which is futural, never something that has been decided; it is something "non-actual" that is already "acting." Poetising is the telling of the thoughts of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 125–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirit is never "at home" in the beginning. At the beginning of the history of a people, their destiny is assigned, but what has been assigned is in coming; it is still veiled and equivocal. In the beginning, the ability to fit oneself to one's destiny is as yet disordered, unpracticed. Thus in spirit there prevails the longing for its own essence. But "spirit loves colony," that is, in the foreign it wills the mother who is difficult to attain. And it loves "bold forgetting," where forgetting means the readiness to learn from the foreign for the sake of what is one's own, so as to defer what is one's own until it is time. It is in this way that the law of being unhomely is the law of becoming homely.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 129–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greeks and Germans===
The Greeks, too, had to pass through the foreign. What was proper to the Greeks was "the fire from the heavens"; what was foreign was the "clarity of presentation." Through what was foreign to them they were able to build at the essential ground of the ''polis''. For the Germans, on the other hand, the clarity of presentation is natural—the formation of projects, frameworks, etc. What is foreign is the fire from heaven, and thus they must learn to be struck by this fire, and thereby impelled to the correct appropriation of their gift for presentation. Otherwise they shall be exposed to the weakness of suppressing every fire, of pursuing [[delimitation]] and institution only for the sake of it. Hölderlin is the one who has been struck by this fire, yet why must this be said poetically?&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poem, river, demigod===
Heidegger cites Hölderlin in order to seek an answer to this question. "Full of merit, yet poetically / Humans dwell upon the earth." "Full of merit" refers, according to Heidegger, to all that humans achieve through the arts, through ''tekhne'', but all that is achieved this way amounts merely to culture. It can be achieved only on the basis of a "dwelling" which can be seized upon through making or achieving within the realm of the actual. Dwelling, the becoming homely of a being unhomely, is grounded in the poetic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

But what is poetry? There must be a poet who poetises in advance the essence of poetry. This will be the poet who ventures into the foreign, to let the fire come toward him. This is what occurs in Hölderlin's hymnal poetry. This river poetry never forgets the source, in its issuing and flowing from the source. What it says is the holy, which, ''beyond'' the gods, determines the gods. The poet stands between human beings and gods. The poet, and the river, are demigods.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger speaks of the lines of the hymn concerning the invitation to [[Hercules]]. We can know nothing of the Ister or the hymn if we do not understand who this guest is. The appropriation of one's own ''is'' only as the encounter and guest-like dialogue with the foreign. The river must remain in the realm of its source in such a way that it flows toward it from out of the foreign, which is why it "appears, however, almost / To go backwards." Heidegger again uses the word ''Wirbeln'' to indicate this swirling near the source.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 140–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical, ahistorical, unhistorical===
This relation to the foreign is never an affirmation of the "natural" or the "organic." These are foreign to the law of history. This law places historical humankind on the difficult path toward its essence. If humankind abandons the law of history, it falls into the unhistorical. Nature is ahistorical, but being ''un''historical, as a ''rupture'' with the historical, is a particular kind of catastrophe. Heidegger's example of the unhistorical is [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ister remains enigmatic but historical, in the strange way it flows but also remains close to the source. It is the river in which the foreign is already present as a guest at its source, the river in whose flowing there constantly speaks the dialogue between one's own and the foreign.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 144–146.&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers are the poets who found the poetic, upon whose ground human beings dwell. Thus the poetic spirit of the river makes arable the land—it prepares the ground for the hearth of the house of history, opening the time-space within which a belonging to the hearth is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A sign is needed===
"A sign is needed": Hölderlin speaks of the sign as having a mind (''Gemüt''), where mind is the ground of all mindful courage (''Mut''). It is the poet who is named here as the sign. What is needed is the poet's word. Heidegger cites the poem "''Andenken''": "Yet what remains, the poets found." Heidegger relates the sign's showing to pain, to that knowing proper to being distinct.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 148–153.&lt;/ref&gt; The sign, the demigod, the river, the poet: all these name poetically the singular ground of the becoming homely of human beings as historical, and the founding of this ground by the poet. At stake is a "partaking in feeling" with the gods, bearing the sun and moon, sharing the holy. This is for the benefit not only of human beings, but of the gods themselves, who are otherwise without feeling, without unity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 154–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The stairs upon which the heavenly descend===
Through the sign, through the rivers, the heavenly find their unity with one another, a unity which does not diminish their singularity. The rivers are their "joy." Hölderlin speaks of staircases on which the heavenly can descend. Where there are staircases, a dwelling place is also opened up poetically for humans. Poetising founding builds the stairs for this descent of the heavenly. The rivers are the children of the heavens, signs that bear sun and moon in mind, but at the same time the sons of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 157–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn ends on an enigmatic note: "Yet what that one does, that river, / No one knows." What the vocation of the Ister is, it well knows, but the [[Rhine]], which does not linger at its source but departs sideways, is altogether concealed. Yet the Ister hymn too breaks off—it shows, it makes manifest, yet it also conceals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 163–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Is there a measure on earth?===
Heidegger appends a concluding remark to his reading of the poem. His remarks on the hymn were intended to make us attentive to the poetising of the rivers. But because this is the poetising of the essence of poetry, concealed relations prevail. Such poetry cannot at all be referred to the poet's ego, or to "subjectivity." The poet is the river, and vice versa. The unity of locality and journeying here cannot be conceived in terms of "space" and "time," for these are themselves the offspring of the realm that lets their openness spring forth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

This poetry demands a transformation in our ways of thinking and experiencing, and we must think beyond representations, symbols, and images. But if we must find a new measure, it must be asked whether we are capable of it. Hölderlin asks about this measure, and concludes there is no such measure on earth. This sounds like despair. Yet what Hölderlin means is that we must dwell poetically upon this earth, bearing and suffering it rather than forcing and seizing it. If we are strong enough to think, it may be sufficient for us to ponder from afar the truth of this poetry and what it poetises, so that we may suddenly be struck by it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger ends with a quotation from yet another Hölderlin hymn, "The Journey":

{{cquote|A dream it becomes for him who would&lt;br /&gt;Approach it by stealth, and punishes him&lt;br /&gt;Who would equal it with force.&lt;br /&gt;Often it surprises one&lt;br /&gt;Who indeed has scarcely thought it.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8212">'''Idealization''' is the process by which [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] assume facts about the phenomenon being modeled that are strictly false but make models easier to understand or solve. That is, it is determined whether the phenomenon approximates an "ideal case," then the model is applied to make a prediction based on that ideal case.

If an approximation is accurate, the model will have high predictive accuracy; for example, it is not usually necessary to account for [[air resistance]] when determining the acceleration of a falling bowling ball, and doing so would be more complicated. In this case, air resistance is idealized to be zero. Although this is not strictly true, it is a good approximation because its effect is negligible compared to that of gravity.

Idealizations may allow predictions to be made when none otherwise could be. For example, the approximation of air resistance as zero was the only option before the formulation of [[Stokes' law]] allowed the calculation of drag forces. Many debates surrounding the usefulness of a particular model are about the appropriateness of different idealizations.

==Early use==
[[Galileo]] utilized the concept of idealization in order to formulate the law of [[free fall]]. [[Galileo]], in his study of bodies in motion, set up experiments that assumed frictionless surfaces and spheres of perfect roundness. The crudity of ordinary objects has the potential to obscure their mathematical essence, and idealization is used to combat this tendency.

The most well-known example of idealization in Galileo's experiments is in his analysis of motion. [[Galileo]] predicted that if a perfectly round and smooth ball were rolled along a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, there would be nothing to stop the ball (in fact, it would slide instead of roll, because rolling requires [[friction]]). This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that there is no air resistance.

==Other examples==
===Mathematics===
[[Geometry]] involves the process of idealization because it studies ideal entities, forms and figures. Perfect [[circles]], [[spheres]], straight [[line (geometry)|lines]] and [[angle]]s are [[abstraction]]s that help us think about and investigate the world.

===Science===
An example of the use of idealization in [[physics]] is in [[Boyle's law|Boyle’s Gas Law]]:
''Given any x and any y, if all the molecules in y are perfectly elastic and spherical, possess equal masses and volumes, have negligible size, and exert no forces on one another except during collisions, then if x is a gas and y is a given mass of x which is trapped in a vessel of variable size and the temperature of y is kept constant, then any decrease of the volume of y increases the pressure of y proportionally, and vice versa.''

In [[physics]], people will often solve for [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]] systems without [[friction]]. While we know that friction is present in actual systems, solving the model without friction can provide insights to the behavior of actual systems where the [[force (physics)|force]] of friction is negligible.

===Social science===
It has been argued by the "Poznań School" (in Poland) that [[Karl Marx]] utilized idealization in the [[social sciences]] (see the works written by [[Leszek Nowak]]).&lt;ref&gt;About the Poznań School, see F. Coniglione, ''Realtà ed astrazione. Scuola polacca ed epistemologia post-positivista'', Catania:CUECM 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Model (economics)|economic models]] individuals are assumed to make maximally rational choices.&lt;ref&gt;B. Hamminga, N.B. De Marchi (Eds.), ''Idealization VI: Idealization in Economics'', Poznań Studies in the Philosophy of the Sciences and the Humanities, Vol. 38, Rodopi:Atlanta-Amsterdam 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption, although known to be violated by actual humans, can often lead to insights about the behavior of human populations.

In [[psychology]], [[idealization]] refers to a [[defence mechanism]] in which a person perceives another to be better (or have more desirable attributes) than would actually be supported by the evidence. This sometimes occurs in [[child custody]] conflicts. The child of a single parent frequently may imagine ("idealize") the (ideal) absent parent to have those characteristics of a perfect parent. However, the child may find imagination is favorable to reality. Upon meeting that parent, the child may be happy for a while, but disappointed later when learning that the parent does not actually nurture, support and protect as the former caretaker parent had.

==Limits on use==
While idealization is used extensively by certain scientific disciplines, it has been rejected by others.&lt;ref name=LIU2004&gt;{{Citation |title=Laws and Models in a Theory of Idealization | author=Chuang Liu | journal=Synthese | year=2004 | volume=138 | issue=3 | pages=363–385 | doi= 10.1023/b:synt.0000016425.36070.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Edmund Husserl]] recognized the importance of idealization but opposed its application to the study of the mind, holding that mental phenomena do not lend themselves to idealization.&lt;ref&gt;Klawiter A (2004). [http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~klawiter/Husserl&amp;Idealization-PS-82.pdf ''Why did Husserl not become the Galileo of the Science of Consciousness?''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although idealization is considered one of the essential elements of modern [[science]], it is nonetheless the source of continued controversy in the literature of the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name=LIU2004/&gt; For example, [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] suggested that Galilean idealization presupposes tendencies or capacities in nature and that this allows for extrapolation beyond what is the ideal case.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright N (1994) [http://141.105.33.55/~lomov/library/bigdvd/dvd54/Cartwright%20N.%20-%20Nature's%20Capacities%20and%20Their%20Measurement(194).pdf ''Nature's capacities and their measurement.''] pp. 186–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is continued philosophical concern over how Galileo’s idealization method assists in the description of the behavior of individuals or objects in the real world. Since the laws created through idealization (such as the [[ideal gas law]]) describe only the behavior of ideal bodies, these laws can only be used to predict the behavior of real bodies when a considerable number of factors have been physically eliminated (e.g. through shielding conditions) or ignored. Laws that account for these factors are usually more complicated and in some cases have not yet been developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4452">'''Infallibilism''', in [[epistemology]], is the idea that propositional [[knowledge]] is incompatible with a chance of being wrong, where this is typically understood as one's evidence or justification providing one's [[belief]] with such strong grounds that it must be [[truth|true]] and perhaps cannot be rationally doubted. Other beliefs may be rationally [[Theory of justification|justified]], but they do not rise to the level of ''knowledge'' unless absolutely certain given one's evidence. Infallibilism's opposite, [[fallibilism]], is the position that a justified true belief may be considered knowledge, even if one's evidence does not guarantee its truth, or can, given one's evidence, rationally doubt it. 

Fallibilism is not to be confused with [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], which is the belief that knowledge is unattainable for rational human beings. [[René Descartes]], an early proponent of infallibilism argued, “my reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly false”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Meditations on First Philosophy|last = Descartes|first = Rene|publisher = |year = 1641|isbn = 978-0-415-07707-1|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infallibilism can be expressed in logic as "if I know that p, then I can't be mistaken about p".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Descartes/DescartesInfallibilismCartesiancircle.pdf|title = Infallibilism and the Cartesian circle|last = Lacewing|first = Michael|date = 2013|journal = A Level Philosophy|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fallibilism is endorsed by most contemporary epistemologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://courses.washington.edu/dbt560/Fallibilism.pdf|title = How to Think about Fallibilism|date = 7 June 2001|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = University of Washington Course Server|publisher = |last = Reed|first = Baron}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many in epistemology have recently presented significant arguments against fallibilism, and for infalliblism.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Mark Kaplan, "If you know you can't be wrong," in {{cite book |last1=Hetherington |first1=Stephen |title=Epistemology Futures |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=180-198 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KAPIYK}}; see also {{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-010-9815-2|title = Warrant does entail truth|last = Moon|first = Andrew|date = 2012|journal = Synthese|doi = 10.1007/s11229-010-9815-2|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015|volume=184|pages=287–297}}; {{cite journal |last1=Dutant |first1=Julien |title=How to Be an Infallibilist |journal=Philosophical Issues |date=2016 |volume=26 |pages=148-171 |doi=10.1111/phis.12085 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phis.12085}}; and {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Knowledge, Hope, and Fallibilism |journal=Synthese |date=2018 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1007/s11229-018-1794-8 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-018-1794-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion]], infallibilism is the belief that certain texts or persons are incapable of being in the wrong. The most famous example of this is probably the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrine of [[papal infallibility]], under which the [[Pope]] is considered infallible in certain matters of doctrine, when his decisions are promulgated ''[[ex cathedra]]''. Since 1870, the Catholic Church has officially declared that its earthly head, the Pope, in certain circumstances, is so grounded in the mission of the church that he teaches "infallibly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://moses.creighton.edu/csrs/news/F96-1.html|title = The History and Future of Papal Infallibility|last = Burke|first = Ronald|date = Fall 1996|work = |access-date = Oct 10, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papal infallibility also belongs to the body of [[bishop]]s as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.catholic.com/tracts/papal-infallibility|title = Papal Infallibility|date = August 10, 2004|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = Catholic Answers|publisher = |last = Brom|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ioane Petritsi''' ({{lang-ka|იოანე პეტრიწი}}) also referred as '''John Petritsi'''&lt;ref&gt;Augustine Casiday, The Orthodox Christian World, p. 544&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Georgians|Georgian]] [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher of the 11th-12th century, active in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Georgia]], best known for his translations of [[Proclus]], along with an extensive commentary. In later sources, he is also referred to as '''Ioane Chimchimeli''' ({{lang-ka|იოანე ჭიმჭიმელი}}). The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] describes Petritsi as "the most significant Georgian medieval philosopher" and the "most widely read Georgian philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/joane-petrizi/|title=Joane Petrizi|last=Iremadze|first=Tengiz|date=2015-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Life==
There is no reliable information on Petritsi's biography except for indirect indications in his own works and a few details provided by the 18th-century Georgian scholarship. He is reported to have been born into an aristocratic family from the province of [[Samtskhe]], and educated at [[Constantinople]] under the tutelage of [[Michael Psellos]] and [[John Italus]]. After the fall of Italus, Ioane seems to have fled to the Georgian monastery of [[Bachkovo Monastery|Petritsoni]] in [[Bulgaria]], whence comes his epithet Petritsi. He translated many philosophical works, principally Neoplatonic, with the aim of reconciling the Classical ideas with the principal message of Christianity. His broad philosophic outlook brought him into collision with the Georgian patristic orthodoxy, until the king [[David IV of Georgia]] eventually established him at [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati Academy]]. He translated [[Aristotle]], Proclus, [[Nemesius]], [[Ammonius Hermiae]], components of the [[Bible]], [[hagiography]], and some other pieces. Of his few original works, an extensive commentary to Proclus and Neoplatonism is the most important. But he also composed ascetic and mystic poetry, and hymns.    

Both in his philosophy and his literary style, Petritsi had a long lasting influence on Georgian philosophic thought and literature, which became more prominent in the 18th century under the reformist scholar Catholicos [[Catholicos Anton I of Georgia|Anton I]].&lt;ref&gt;Iremadze, Tengiz (2006).

==Career==
In 1979, Payeng, then 16, encountered a large number of snakes that had died due to excessive heat after floods washed them onto the tree-less sandbar. That is when he planted around 20 bamboo seedlings on the sandbar.&lt;ref name=toi14/&gt;&lt;ref name="SuccessStories"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.successstories.co.in/incredible-story-of-persistence-and-devotion-jadav-payeng-single-Handedly-converts-a-sandbar-into-a-prosperous-1360-acre-forest/ | title=Incredible story of Persistence and Devotion: Jadav Payeng Single-handedly Converts a Sandbar into a Prosperous 1,360-acre Forest | publisher=[[Success Stories]] | accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started working on the forest in 19  A.D.when the social forestry division of [[Golaghat district]] launched a scheme of tree plantation on 200 hectares at Aruna Chapori situated at a distance of 5&amp;nbsp;km from Kokilamukh in [[Jorhat district]]. Molai was one of the labourers who worked In that project which was completed after five years. He chose to stay back after the completion of the project even after other workers left. He not only looked after the plants, but continued to plant more trees on his own, in an effort to transform the area into a forest.

The forest, which came to be known as Molai forest, now houses [[Bengal tiger]]s, [[Indian rhinoceros]], and over 100 deer and rabbits. Molai forest is also Home to monkeys and several varieties of birds, Including a large number of vultures.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2012"/&gt; There are several thousand trees, including valcol, arjun (''[[Terminalia arjuna]]''), ejar (''[[Lagerstroemia speciosa]]''), goldmohur (''[[Delonix regia]]''), koroi (''[[Albizia procera]]''), moj (''[[Archidendron bigeminum]]'') and himolu (''[[Bombax ceiba]]''). Bamboo covers an area of over 300 hectares.&lt;ref name="asianagearchive"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.asianage.com/india/man-creates-forest-single-handedly-brahmaputra-sand-bar-972 | title=Man creates forest single-handedly on Brahmaputra sand bar | publisher=[[The Asian Age]] | accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A herd of around 100 elephants regularly visits the forest every year and generally stay for around six months. They have given birth to 10 calves in the forest in recent years.&lt;ref name="asianagearchive"/&gt;

His efforts became known to the authorities in 2008, when forest department officials went to the area in search of a herd of 115 elephants that had retreated into the forest after damaging property in the village of Aruna Chapori, which is about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from the forest. The officials were surprised to see such a large and dense forest and since then the department has regularly visited the site.&lt;ref name="asianagearchive"/&gt;

In 2013, poachers tried to kill the rhinos staying in the forest but failed in their attempt due to Molai who alerted department officials. Officials promptly seized various articles used by the poachers to trap the animals.&lt;ref name="asianagearchive"/&gt;

Molai is ready to manage the forest in a better way and to go to other places of the state to start a similar venture. Now his aim is to spread his forest to another sand bar inside of Brahmaputra.&lt;ref name="ajithkumar.cc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajithkumar.cc/my-thoughts/one-of-the-greatest-achievements-of-the-human-race-jadav-payeng/ |title=One of the Greatest Achievements of the Human Race – Jadav Payeng |publisher=Ajith Kumar.

==Personal life==
Jadav Payeng belongs to a tribe called "[[Mising people|Mising]]" in Assam, India. He lives in a small hut in the forest. Binita, his wife, and his 3 children (two sons and a daughter) accompany him.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2012"/&gt; He has cattle and buffalo on his farm and sells the milk for his livelihood, which is his only source of income.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2012"/&gt; In an interview from 2012, he revealed that he has lost around 100 of his cows and buffaloes to the tigers in the forest, but blames the people who carry out large scale encroachment and destruction of forests as the root cause of the plight of wild animals.&lt;ref name="ajithkumar.cc"/&gt;

[[File:John Locke's Kit-cat portrait by Godfrey Kneller, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|John Locke's [[kit-cat portrait]] by [[Godfrey Kneller]], National Portrait Gallery, London]]

'''John Locke''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|l|ɒ|k}}; 29 August 1632&amp;nbsp;– 28 October 1704) was an English [[philosopher]] and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers and commonly known as the "Father of [[Classical liberalism|Liberalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hirschmann, Nancy J., ''Gender, Class, and Freedom in Modern Political Theory'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2009. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Urmila &amp; Sharma, S.K., ''Western Political Thought'', Atlantic Publishers, Washington, 2006, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korab-Karpowicz, W. Julian, ''A History of Political Philosophy: From Thucydides to Locke'', Global Scholarly Publications, New York, 2010, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Considered one of the first of the British [[Empiricism|empiricists]], following the tradition of Sir [[Francis Bacon]], he is equally important to [[social contract]] theory. His work greatly affected the development of [[epistemology]] and [[political philosophy]]. His writings influenced [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], many [[Scottish Enlightenment]] thinkers, as well as the [[American Revolution|American revolutionaries]]. His contributions to [[classical republicanism]] and [[liberal theory]] are reflected in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Carl Lotus, ''The Declaration of Independence: A Study in the History of Political Ideas'', Harcourt, Brace, 1922, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]] is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and the [[self (psychology)|self]], figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as [[David Hume]], Rousseau, and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Locke was the first to define the self through a continuity of [[consciousness]]. He postulated that, at birth, the [[mind]] was a blank slate or ''[[tabula rasa]]''. Contrary to [[Descartes|Cartesian]] philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without [[Innatism|innate ideas]], and that [[knowledge]] is instead [[empiricism|determined only by experience]] derived from [[sense]] [[perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Baird |first1=Forrest E |first2=Walter |last2=Kaufmann |title=From Plato to Derrida |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2008 |location=Upper Saddle River, [[New Jersey|NJ]] |pages=527–29 |isbn=0-13-158591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now known as empiricism. An example of Locke's belief in empiricism can be seen in his quote, "whatever I write, as soon as I discover it not to be true, my hand shall be the forwardest to throw it into the fire." This shows the ideology of science in his observations in that something must be capable of being tested repeatedly and that nothing is exempt from being disproven. Challenging the work of others, Locke is said to have established the method of [[introspection]], or observing the emotions and behaviours of one’s self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baldwin |first=B.T. |year=1913 |title=John Locke's Contributions to Education. |jstor=27532614 |journal=The Sewanee Review |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=177–87 [179]|quote=[He was a] pioneer in psychology,... and established on a substantial basis the introspective method of to-day; ... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Locke's father, also called John, was an attorney who served as clerk to the Justices of the Peace in [[Chew Magna]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Broad |first=CD |year=2000 |title=Ethics And the History of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |location=UK |isbn=0-415-22530-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had served as a captain of cavalry for the [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces during the early part of the [[English Civil War]]. His mother was Agnes Keene. Both parents were [[Puritan]]s. Locke was born on 29 August 1632, in a small thatched [[cottage]] by the church in [[Wrington]], Somerset, about 12 miles from [[Bristol]]. He was [[baptism|baptised]] the same day. Soon after Locke's birth, the family moved to the [[market town]] of [[Pensford]], about seven miles south of Bristol, where Locke grew up in a rural [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] house in [[Belluton]].

In 1647, Locke was sent to the prestigious [[Westminster School]] in London under the sponsorship of [[Alexander Popham]], a member of Parliament and his father's former commander. After completing studies there, he was admitted to [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], in the autumn of 1652 at the age of twenty. The dean of the college at the time was [[John Owen (theologian)|John Owen]], vice-chancellor of the university. Although a capable student, Locke was irritated by the undergraduate curriculum of the time. He found the works of modern philosophers, such as [[René Descartes]], more interesting than the [[classics|classical]] material taught at the university. Through his friend [[Richard Lower (physician)|Richard Lower]], whom he knew from the Westminster School, Locke was introduced to medicine and the experimental philosophy being pursued at other universities and in the [[Royal Society]], of which he eventually became a member.

Locke was awarded a [[bachelor's degree]] in February 1656 and a master's degree in June 1658.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=locke |title=John Locke |last=Uzgalis |first=William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a [[bachelor of medicine]] in February 1675,&lt;!---older sources give 1674--&gt;{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 116}} having studied medicine extensively during his time at Oxford and worked with such noted scientists and thinkers as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Thomas Willis]], [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Richard Lower (physician)|Richard Lower]]. In 1666, he met Lord [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a [[liver]] infection. Cooper was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue.

Locke had been looking for a career and in 1667 moved into Shaftesbury's home at Exeter House in London, to serve as Lord Ashley's personal physician. In London, Locke resumed his medical studies under the tutelage of [[Thomas Sydenham]]. Sydenham had a major effect on Locke's natural philosophical thinking{{spaced ndash}}an effect that would become evident in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]].''

Locke's medical knowledge was put to the test when Shaftesbury's liver infection became life-threatening. Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Shaftesbury to undergo surgery (then life-threatening itself) to remove the cyst. Shaftesbury survived and prospered, crediting Locke with saving his life.

During this time, Locke served as Secretary of the [[Board of Trade]] and Plantations and Secretary to the [[Lords Proprietor]] of Carolina, which helped to shape his ideas on international trade and economics.

Shaftesbury, as a founder of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] movement, exerted great influence on Locke's political ideas. Locke became involved in politics when Shaftesbury became [[Lord Chancellor]] in 1672. Following Shaftesbury's fall from favour in 1675, Locke spent some time travelling across France as tutor and medical attendant to [[Caleb Banks]].&lt;ref name=Henning&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HW1_upECKUwC&amp;pg=PA590&amp;lpg=PA590&amp;dq=%22Caleb+Banks%22+Aylesford#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Caleb%20Banks%22%20Aylesford&amp;f=false |first=Basil Duke |last=Henning |title=The House of Commons, 1660–1690 |volume=1 |publisher=Google |accessdate=28 August 2012 |isbn=9780436192746 |date=1983-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to England in 1679 when Shaftesbury's political fortunes took a brief positive turn. Around this time, most likely at Shaftesbury's prompting, Locke composed the bulk of the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. While it was once thought that Locke wrote the ''Treatises'' to defend the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed well before this date.{{Sfn | Laslett | 1988 | loc = III. ''Two Treatises of Government'' and the Revolution of 1688}} The work is now viewed as a more general argument against [[absolute monarchy]] (particularly as espoused by [[Robert Filmer]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]]) and for individual consent as the basis of [[political legitimacy]]. Although Locke was associated with the influential Whigs, his ideas about [[natural and legal rights|natural rights]] and government are today considered quite revolutionary for that period in English history.

Locke fled to the [[Netherlands]] in 1683, under strong suspicion of involvement in the [[Rye House Plot]], although there is little evidence to suggest that he was directly involved in the scheme. The philosopher and novelist [[Rebecca Newberger Goldstein]] argues that during his five years in Holland, Locke chose his friends "from among the same freethinking members of dissenting Protestant groups as [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]] small group of loyal confidants. [Baruch Spinoza had died in 1677.] Locke almost certainly met men in Amsterdam who spoke of the ideas of that renegade Jew who... insisted on identifying himself through his religion of reason alone." While she says that "Locke's strong empiricist tendencies" would have "disinclined him to read a grandly metaphysical work such as Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', in other ways he was deeply receptive to Spinoza's ideas, most particularly to the rationalist's well thought out argument for political and [[religious tolerance]] and the necessity of the separation of church and state."&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, ''Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity'', New York: Schocken Books (2006), pp. 260–61&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, Locke had time to return to his writing, spending a great deal of time re-working the ''Essay'' and composing the ''Letter on Toleration.'' Locke did not return home until after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. Locke accompanied [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] back to England in 1688. The bulk of Locke's publishing took place upon his return from exile{{spaced ndash}}his aforementioned ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', the ''Two Treatises of Civil Government'' and ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'' all appearing in quick succession.

Locke's close friend [[Lady Masham]] invited him to join her at the Mashams' country house in Essex. Although his time there was marked by variable health from [[asthma]] attacks, he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs. During this period he discussed matters with such figures as [[John Dryden]] and [[Isaac Newton]].

He died on 28 October 1704, and is buried in the churchyard of the village of [[High Laver]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Britannica Online |contribution=John Locke}}.&lt;/ref&gt; east of [[Harlow]] in Essex, where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691. Locke never married nor had children.

Events that happened during Locke's lifetime include the [[English Restoration]], the [[Great Plague of London]] and the [[Great Fire of London]]. He did not quite see the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union of 1707]], though the thrones of England and Scotland were held in [[personal union]] throughout his lifetime. [[Constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]] were in their infancy during Locke's time.

==Ideas==
In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Locke's ''Two Treatises'' were rarely cited. Historian Julian Hoppit said of the book, "except among some Whigs, even as a contribution to the intense debate of the 1690s it made little impression and was generally ignored until 1703 (though in Oxford in 1695 it was reported to have made 'a great noise')".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty? England. 1689–1727'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2000), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Philipps Kenyon|John Kenyon]], in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720, has remarked that Locke's theories were "mentioned so rarely in the early stages of the [Glorious] Revolution, up to 1692, and even less thereafter, unless it was to heap abuse on them" and that "no one, including most Whigs, [were] ready for the idea of a notional or abstract contract of the kind adumbrated by Locke".&lt;ref&gt;John Kenyon, ''Revolution Principles. The Politics of Party. 1689–1720'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Kenyon adds that [[Algernon Sidney]]'s ''Discourses Concerning Government'' were "certainly much more influential than Locke's ''Two Treatises''".&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 51. Kenyon adds: "Any unbiassed study of the position shows in fact that it was Filmer, not Hobbes, Locke or Sidney, who was the most influential thinker of the age". Kenyon, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 50 years after Queen Anne's death in 1714, the ''Two Treatises'' were reprinted only once (except in the collected works of Locke). However, with the rise of American resistance to British taxation, the ''Second Treatise'' gained a new readership; it was frequently cited in the debates in both America and Britain. The first American printing occurred in 1773 in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB |id=16885 |title=Locke, John (1632–1704) |origyear=2004 |year=2008 |last=Milton |first=John R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke exercised a profound influence on political philosophy, in particular on modern liberalism. [[Michael Zuckert]] has argued that Locke launched liberalism by tempering Hobbesian absolutism and clearly [[separation of church and state|separating the realms of Church and State]]. He had a strong influence on [[Voltaire]] who called him "''le sage'' Locke". His arguments concerning [[liberty]] and the [[social contract]] later influenced the written works of [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and other [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. In fact, one passage from the ''Second Treatise'' is reproduced verbatim in the Declaration of Independence, the reference to a "long train of abuses". Such was Locke's influence that Thomas Jefferson wrote: "[[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], Locke and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]... I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Three Greatest Men |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tr11a.html#obj11 |accessdate=27 June 2018 |quote=Jefferson identified [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], Locke, and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] as "the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception".

But Locke's influence may have been even more profound in the realm of epistemology. Locke redefined subjectivity, or self, and intellectual historians such as [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and Jerrold Seigel argue that Locke's ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) marks the beginning of the modern Western conception of the self.&lt;ref&gt;Seigel, Jerrold. ''The Idea of the Self: Thought and Experience in Western Europe since the Seventeenth Century.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Charles |last=Taylor |title=Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity |place=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's theory of association heavily influenced the subject matter of modern psychology. At the time, the empiricist philosopher's recognition of two types of ideas, ''simple'' and ''complex'' ideas, more importantly their interaction through associationism inspired other philosophers, such as [[David Hume]] and [[George Berkeley]], to revise and expand this theory and apply it to explain how humans gain knowledge in the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Modern Psychology (ninth edition) |last=Schultz |first=Duane P. |publisher=Thomas Higher Education |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-495-09799-0 |location=Belmont, CA 94002-3098 |pages=47–48 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of religious tolerance===
{{See also|Toleration#Locke}}
[[File:John Locke by Richard Westmacott.jpg|thumb|John Locke by [[Richard Westmacott]], University College, London]]

Locke, writing his ''Letters Concerning Toleration'' (1689–1692) in the aftermath of the [[European wars of religion]], formulated a classic reasoning for religious tolerance. Three arguments are central: (1) Earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) Even if they could, enforcing a single "true religion" would not have the desired effect, because belief cannot be compelled by violence; (3) Coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to his position on religious tolerance, Locke was influenced by [[Baptist]] theologians like [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] and [[Thomas Helwys]], who had published tracts demanding freedom of conscience in the early 17th century.{{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}}{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | p = 18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |language=German |first=H |last=Stahl |contribution=Baptisten |title=Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart |year=1957}}, 3. Auflage, Band I, col. 863&lt;/ref&gt;  Baptist theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] founded the colony [[Rhode Island]] in 1636, where he combined a democratic constitution with unlimited religious freedom. His tract ''[[The Bloody Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience]]'' (1644), which was widely read in the mother country, was a passionate plea for absolute religious freedom and the total separation of church and state.{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | pp = 102–105}}  Freedom of conscience had had high priority on the theological, philosophical and political agenda, since [[Martin Luther]] refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at Worms in 1521, unless he would be proved false by the Bible.{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | p = 5}}

===Constitution of Carolina===
Appraisals of Locke have often been tied to appraisals of liberalism in general, and to appraisals of the United States. Detractors note that (in 1671) he was a major investor in the English slave-trade through the [[Royal African Company]]. In addition, he participated in drafting the ''[[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]'' while [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]]'s secretary, which established a feudal aristocracy and gave a master absolute power over his slaves. For example, [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] notes that Locke, as a secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations (1673–1674) and a member of the Board of Trade (1696–1700), was in fact, "one of just half a dozen men who created and supervised both the colonies and their iniquitous systems of servitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Martin |last=Cohen |title=Philosophical Tales |publisher=Blackwell |year=2008 |page=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some see his statements on [[enclosure|unenclosed]] [[property]] as having been intended to justify the displacement of the Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=James |last=Tully |title=An Approach to Political Philosophy: Locke in Contexts |place=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |page=128 |isbn=978-0521436380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.1177/0090591786014002005 |title=I.

Collectively, these documents are known as the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina]].

===Theory of value and property===
Locke uses the word ''property'' in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from [[manual labour|labour]]. In Chapter V of his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise]]'', Locke argues that the individual ownership of goods and property is justified by the labour exerted to produce those goods or utilise property to produce goods beneficial to human society.&lt;ref name=labortheory&gt;{{Citation |last=Vaughn |first=Karen |title=John Locke and the Labor Theory of Value |journal=Journal of Libertarian Studies |year=1978 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=311–26 |url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/2_4/2_4_3.pdf |accessdate=13 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019073702/http://mises.org/journals/jls/2_4/2_4_3.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke stated his belief, in his ''Second Treatise'', that nature on its own provides little of value to society, implying that the labour expended in the creation of goods gives them their value. This position can be seen as a [[labour theory of value]].&lt;ref name=labortheory /&gt; From this premise, Locke developed a [[labour theory of property]], namely that ownership of [[property]] is created by the application of labour. In addition, he believed that property precedes government and government cannot "dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily." [[Karl Marx]] later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his own social theory.

===Political theory===
{{See also|Two Treatises of Government}}
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
Locke's political theory was founded on [[social contract]] theory. Unlike [[Thomas Hobbes]], Locke believed that [[human nature]] is characterised by reason and tolerance. Like Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature allowed people to be selfish. This is apparent with the introduction of currency. In a [[State of nature#Locke's view on the state of nature|natural state]] all people were equal and independent, and everyone had a natural right to defend his "life, health, liberty, or possessions".&lt;ref name="locke"&gt;{{Citation |last=Locke |first=John |title=Second Treatise of Government |edition=10th |publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] |year=1690 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|198}} Most scholars trace the phrase "[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]," in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American Declaration of Independence]], to Locke's theory of rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zuckert |first=Michael |title=The Natural Rights Republic |year=1996 |publisher=Notre Dame University Press |pages=73–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other origins have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wills |first=Garry |title=Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Hobbes, Locke assumed that the sole right to defend in the state of nature was not enough, so people established a [[civil society]] to resolve conflicts in a civil way with help from government in a state of society. However, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Skinner |first=Quentin |title=Visions of Politics |place=Cambridge}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke also advocated governmental [[separation of powers]] and believed that revolution is not only a [[Right of revolution|right]] but an obligation in some circumstances. These ideas would come to have profound influence on the Declaration of Independence and the [[Constitution of the United States]].

====Limits to accumulation====
{{See also|Lockean proviso}}
According to Locke, unused property is wasteful and an offence against nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Locke |first=John |title=Two Treatises on Government: A Translation Into Modern English |year=2009 |publisher=Industrial Systems Research |isbn=978-0-906321-47-8 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S3eB0IgzJjoC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=John+Locke+unused+property+waste+offence+against+nature#v=onepage&amp;q=unused%20property&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but, with the introduction of "durable" goods, men could exchange their excessive perishable goods for goods that would last longer and thus not offend the [[natural law]]. In his view, the introduction of money marks the culmination of this process, making possible the unlimited accumulation of property without causing waste through spoilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Locke: Inequality is inevitable and necessary |url=http://www0.hku.hk/philodep/courses/ac/Phil1003-2008/Locke2.ppt |publisher=Department of Philosophy The University of Hong Kong |accessdate=1 September 2011 |format=MS PowerPoint |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509074104/http://www.hku.hk/philodep/courses/ac/Phil1003-2008/Locke2.ppt |archivedate=9 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also includes gold or silver as money because they may be "hoarded up without injury to anyone,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Locke |title=Second Treatise |at=§§&amp;nbsp;25–51, 123–26 |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch16s3.html |publisher=The Founders Constitution |accessdate=1 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911101831/http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch16s3.html |archivedate=11 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; since they do not spoil or decay in the hands of the possessor. In his view, the introduction of money eliminates the limits of accumulation. Locke stresses that inequality has come about by tacit agreement on the use of money, not by the social contract establishing civil society or the law of land regulating property. Locke is aware of a problem posed by unlimited accumulation but does not consider it his task. He just implies that government would function to moderate the conflict between the unlimited accumulation of property and a more nearly equal distribution of wealth; he does not identify which principles that government should apply to solve this problem. However, not all elements of his thought form a consistent whole. For example, [[labour theory of value]] of the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' stands side by side with the demand-and-supply theory developed in a letter he wrote titled ''Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money''. Moreover, Locke anchors property in labour but in the end upholds the unlimited accumulation of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Cobb |last1=Cliff |first2=Fred |last2=Foldvary |title=John Locke on Property |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/cobb-cliff-and-fred-foldvary_john-locke-on-property-1999.html |publisher=The School of Cooperative Individualism |accessdate=14 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315171711/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/cobb-cliff-and-fred-foldvary_john-locke-on-property-1999.html |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On price theory===
Locke's general theory of value and price is a [[supply and demand]] theory, which was set out in a letter to a Member of Parliament in 1691, titled ''Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=John |last=Locke |year=1691 |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/locke/contents.htm |title=Some Considerations on the consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money |publisher=Marxists}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to supply as "quantity" and demand as "[[Economic rent|rent]]". "The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers," and "that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent." The quantity theory of money forms a special case of this general theory. His idea is based on "money answers all things" (Ecclesiastes) or "rent of money is always sufficient, or more than enough," and "varies very little..." Locke concludes that as far as money is concerned, the demand is exclusively regulated by its quantity, regardless of whether the [[demand for money]] is unlimited or constant. He also investigates the determinants of demand and supply. For supply, he explains the value of goods as based on their scarcity and ability to be exchanged and consumed. He explains demand for goods as based on their ability to yield a flow of income. Locke develops an early theory of [[Capital (economics)|capitalisation]], such as land, which has value because "by its constant production of saleable commodities it brings in a certain yearly income." He considers the demand for money as almost the same as demand for goods or land; it depends on whether money is wanted as medium of exchange. As a medium of exchange, he states that "money is capable by exchange to procure us the necessaries or conveniences of life," and for loanable funds, "it comes to be of the same nature with land by yielding a certain yearly income... or interest."

====Monetary thoughts====
Locke distinguishes two functions of money, as a "counter" to measure value, and as a "pledge" to lay claim to [[good (economics)|goods]]. He believes that silver and gold, as opposed to paper money, are the appropriate currency for international transactions. Silver and gold, he says, are treated to have equal value by all of humanity and can thus be treated as a pledge by anyone, while the value of paper money is only valid under the government which issues it.

Locke argues that a country should seek a favourable [[balance of trade]], lest it fall behind other countries and suffer a loss in its trade. Since the world money stock grows constantly, a country must constantly seek to enlarge its own stock. Locke develops his theory of foreign exchanges, in addition to commodity movements, there are also movements in country stock of money, and movements of capital determine exchange rates. He considers the latter less significant and less volatile than commodity movements. As for a country's [[money supply|money stock]], if it is large relative to that of other countries, he says it will cause the country's exchange to rise above par, as an export balance would do.

He also prepares estimates of the [[cash]] requirements for different economic groups (landholders, labourers and brokers). In each group he posits that the cash requirements are closely related to the length of the pay period. He argues the brokers&amp;nbsp;– middlemen&amp;nbsp;– whose activities enlarge the monetary circuit and whose profits eat into the earnings of labourers and landholders, have a negative influence on both personal and the public economy to which they supposedly contribute.

===The self===
Locke defines the self as "that conscious thinking thing, (whatever substance, made up of whether spiritual, or material, simple, or compounded, it matters not) which is sensible, or conscious of pleasure and pain, capable of happiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, as far as that consciousness extends".{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 307}}  He does not, however, ignore "substance", writing that "the body too goes to the making the man."{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 306}}

In his ''Essay'', Locke explains the gradual unfolding of this conscious mind. Arguing against both the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] view of man as [[original sin|originally sinful]] and the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions, Locke posits an "empty" mind, a ''tabula rasa'', which is shaped by experience; [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] and [[human self-reflection|reflections]] being the two sources of '''all''' our [[idea]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The American International Encyclopedia |publisher=JJ Little Co |place=New York |year=1954 |volume=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' is an outline on how to educate this mind: he expresses the belief that education maketh the man, or, more fundamentally, that the mind is an "empty cabinet", with the statement, "I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education."{{Sfn | Locke | 1996 | p = 10}}

Locke also wrote that "the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences."{{Sfn | Locke | 1996 | p = 10}}  He argued that the "[[Association of Ideas|associations of ideas]]" that one makes when young are more important than those made later because they are the foundation of the self: they are, put differently, what first mark the ''tabula rasa''. In his ''Essay'', in which both these concepts are introduced, Locke warns against, for example, letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the night for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 357}}

This theory came to be called "associationism", and it strongly influenced 18th-century thought, particularly [[education theory|educational theory]], as nearly every educational writer warned parents not to allow their children to develop negative associations. It also led to the development of [[psychology]] and other new disciplines with [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]]'s attempt to discover a biological mechanism for associationism in his ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749).

===Dream argument===
Locke was critical of Descartes' version of the [[dream argument]], with Locke making the counterargument that people cannot have physical pain in dreams as they do in waking life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/dreaming/#SH1b |title=Dreaming, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==
Some scholars have seen Locke's political convictions as being based from his religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Greg |last=Forster |title=John Locke's politics of moral consensus |year=2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Kim Ian |last=Parker |title=The biblical politics of John Locke |year=2004 |publisher=Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=John |last=Locke |title=Writings on religion |editor-first=Victor |editor-last=Nuovo |place=Oxford |year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's religious trajectory began in [[Calvinist]] [[trinitarianism]], but by the time of the ''Reflections'' (1695) Locke was advocating not just [[Socinianism|Socinian]] views on tolerance but also Socinian Christology.&lt;ref name="Marshall 1994 426"&gt;{{Citation |first=John |last=Marshall |title=John Locke: resistance, religion and responsibility |place=Cambridge |year=1994 |page=426}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However Wainwright (1987) notes that in the posthumously published ''Paraphrase'' (1707) Locke's interpretation of one verse, Ephesians 1:10, is markedly different from that of Socinians like [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|Biddle]], and may indicate that near the end of his life Locke returned nearer to an [[Arian]] position, thereby accepting Christ's pre-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Clarendon Edition of the Works of John Locke: A Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans, Ephesians|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1987|isbn=9780198248064|editor-last=Wainwright|editor-first=Arthur, W.|location=Oxford|pages=806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall 1994 426" /&gt;
Locke was at times not sure about the subject of [[original sin]], so he was accused of Socinianism, Arianism, or Deism.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 27, 223}}  But he did not deny the reality of evil. Man was capable of waging unjust wars and committing crimes. Criminals had to be punished, even with the death penalty.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 145}}  With regard to the Bible Locke was very conservative. He retained the doctrine of the [[verbal inspiration]] of the Scriptures.{{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}}  The miracles were proof of the divine nature of the biblical message. Locke was convinced that the entire content of the Bible was in agreement with human reason (''The reasonableness of Christianity'', 1695).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=D |last=Henrich |contribution=Locke, John |title=Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart |year=1960 |language=German}}, 3. Auflage, Band IV, Spalte 426&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}}  Although Locke was an advocate of tolerance, he urged the authorities not to tolerate [[atheism]], because he thought the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 217 ff}}  That excluded all atheistic varieties of philosophy and all attempts to deduce ethics and natural law from purely secular premises.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 13}}  In Locke's opinion the [[cosmological argument]] was valid and proved God's existence. His political thought was based on Protestant Christian views.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote=[The ''Two Treatises of Government'' are] saturated with Christian assumptions. |first=John |last=Dunn |year=1969 |title=The Political Thought of John Locke: A Historical Account of the Argument of the 'Two Treatises of Government' |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge, UK |page=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy From Religion ===
Locke's concept of man started with the belief in creation.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 142}}  Like philosophers [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Samuel Pufendorf]], Locke equated [[natural law]] with the biblical [[revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=M |last=Elze |contribution=Grotius, Hugo |title=Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart |year=1958 |language=German}}, 3. Auflage, Band II, col. 1885–1886&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=H |last=Hohlwein |title=Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart |year=1961 |language=German |contribution=Pufendorf, Samuel Freiherr von}}, 3. Auflage, Band V, col. 721&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 12}} Locke derived the fundamental concepts of his political theory from biblical texts, in particular from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1 and 2 ([[Genesis creation narrative|creation]]), the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]], the [[Golden Rule]], the teachings of [[Jesus]], and the letters of [[Paul the Apostle]].{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 22–43, 45–46, 101, 153–58, 195, 197}}  [[Ten Commandments|The Decalogue]] puts a person's life, their reputation, and property under God's protection. 

Locke's philosophy on freedom is also derived from the Bible. Locke also derived basic human equality from the Bible, including the [[equality of the sexes]], the starting point of the theological doctrine of [[Imago Dei]].{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 21–43}}  To Locke, one of the consequences of the principle of equality was that all humans were created equally free and therefore governments needed the consent of the governed.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 136}}  

Following Locke's philosophy, the American [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] founded [[human rights]] partially on the biblical belief in creation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7433">The '''Lesk algorithm''' is a classical algorithm for [[word sense disambiguation]] introduced by [[Mike Lesk|Michael E. Lesk]] in 1986.
&lt;ref&gt;
Lesk, M. (1986). [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=318728&amp;dl=GUIDE,ACM&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;CFID=103485667&amp;CFTOKEN=64768709 Automatic sense disambiguation using machine readable dictionaries: how to tell a pine cone from an ice cream cone]. In SIGDOC '86: Proceedings of the 5th annual international conference on Systems documentation, pages 24-26, New York, NY, USA. ACM.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Lesk algorithm is based on the assumption that words in a given "neighborhood" (section of text) will tend to share a common topic. A simplified version of the Lesk algorithm is to compare the dictionary definition of an ambiguous word with the terms contained in its neighborhood. Versions have been adapted to use [[WordNet]].&lt;ref&gt;Satanjeev Banerjee and Ted Pedersen. ''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~banerjee/Publications/cicling2002.ps.gz An Adapted Lesk Algorithm for Word Sense Disambiguation Using WordNet]'', Lecture Notes in Computer Science; Vol. 2276, Pages: 136 - 145, 2002. {{ISBN|3-540-43219-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; An implementation might look like this:
# for every sense of the word being disambiguated one should count the amount of words that are in both neighborhood of that word and in the dictionary definition of that sense
# the sense that is to be chosen is the sense which has the biggest number of this count

A frequently used example illustrating this algorithm is for the context "pine cone".  The following dictionary definitions are used:
 PINE 
 1. kinds of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves
 2. waste away through sorrow or illness

 CONE 
 1. solid body which narrows to a point
 2. something of this shape whether solid or hollow
 3. fruit of certain evergreen trees
As can be seen, the best intersection is Pine #1 ⋂ Cone #3 = 2.

==Simplified Lesk algorithm==

In Simplified Lesk algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;Kilgarriff and J. Rosenzweig. 2000. English SENSEVAL:Report and Results. In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Language Resourcesand Evaluation, LREC, Athens, Greece.&lt;/ref&gt; the correct meaning of each word in a given context is determined individually by locating the sense that overlaps the most between its dictionary definition and the given context. Rather than simultaneously determining the meanings of all words in a given context, this approach tackles each word individually, independent of the meaning of the other words occurring in the same context.

"A comparative evaluation performed by Vasilescu et al. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Florentina Vasilescu, Philippe Langlais, and Guy Lapalme.
2004. Evaluating Variants of the Lesk Approach for Disambiguating Words. LREC, Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the simplified Lesk algorithm can significantly outperform the original definition of the algorithm, both in terms of precision and efficiency. By evaluating the disambiguation algorithms on the Senseval-2 English all words data, they measure a 58% precision using the simplified Lesk algorithm compared to the only 42% under the original algorithm.

Note: Vasilescu et al. implementation considers a back-off strategy for words not covered by the algorithm, consisting of the most frequent sense defined in WordNet. This means that words for which all their possible meanings lead to zero overlap with current context or with other word definitions are by default assigned sense number one in WordNet."&lt;ref&gt;Agirre, Eneko &amp; Philip Edmonds (eds.). 2006.

The COMPUTEOVERLAP function returns the number of words in common between two sets, ignoring function words or other words on a stop list. The original Lesk algorithm defines the context in a more complex way.

==Criticisms and other Lesk-based methods==
Unfortunately, Lesk’s approach is very sensitive to the exact wording of definitions, so the absence of a certain word can radically change the results. Further, the algorithm determines overlaps only among the glosses of the senses being considered. This is a significant limitation in that dictionary glosses tend to be fairly short and do not provide sufficient vocabulary to relate fine-grained sense distinctions.

A lot of work has appeared offering different modifications of this algorithm. These works use other resources for analysis (thesauruses, synonyms dictionaries or morphological and syntactic models): for instance, it may use such information as synonyms, different derivatives, or words from definitions of words from definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gelbukh, Grigori Sidorov.

There are a lot of studies concerning Lesk and its extensions:&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Navigli. [http://www.dsi.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/ACM_Survey_2009_Navigli.pdf ''Word Sense Disambiguation: A Survey]'', ACM Computing Surveys, 41(2), 2009, pp. 1–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Adapted/Extended Lesk (Banerjee and Pederson, 2002/2003)  : In adaptive lesk algorithm, A work vector is created corresponds to every content word in the wordnet gloss. Concatenating glosses of related concepts in WordNet can be used to augment this vector. The vector contains the co-occurrence counts of words co-occurring with w in a large corpus. Adding all the word vectors for all the content words in its gloss creates the Gloss vector g for a concept. Relatedness is determined by comparing the gloss vector using the Cosine similarity measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Banerjee|first=Satanjeev|last2=Pedersen|first2=Ted|date=2002-02-17|title=An Adapted Lesk Algorithm for Word Sense Disambiguation Using WordNet|journal=Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=136–145|doi=10.1007/3-540-45715-1_11|isbn=978-3540457152|citeseerx=10.1.1.118.8359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mere Christianity''''' is a [[Theology|theological]] book by [[C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis]], adapted from a series of [[BBC]] radio talks made between 1941 and 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/people/cslewis_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Christianity: C.S. Lewis|access-date=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Lewis was at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-065292-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewis, C.&amp;nbsp;S. |title=Mere Christianity: a revised and amplified edition, with a new introduction, of the three books, Broadcast talks, Christian behaviour, and Beyond personality |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |location=[San Francisco] |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-06-065292-6 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a classic of [[Christian apologetics]], the transcripts of the broadcasts originally appeared in print as three separate pamphlets: ''The Case for Christianity'' (''Broadcast Talks'' in the UK) (1942), ''Christian Behaviour'' (1943), and ''Beyond Personality'' (1944).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas R. Gilbert, Clyde S. Kilby, C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis, (Eerdmans, 2005), page 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis was invited to give the talks by James Welch, the BBC Director of Religious Broadcasting, who had read his 1940 book, ''[[The Problem of Pain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Philips, ''C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis in A Time of War'', HarperCollins 2002, page 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thesis==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
[[C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis]], an [[Anglican]], intended to describe the [[Christianity|Christian]] common ground. In ''Mere Christianity'', he aims at avoiding controversies to explain fundamental teachings of Christianity, for the sake of those basically educated as well as the intellectuals of his generation, for whom the jargon of formal [[Christian theology]] did not retain its original meaning.

===''The Case for Christianity''  (''Broadcast Talks'' in UK)===
Lewis spends most of his defence of the Christian faith on an [[argument from morality]], a point which persuaded him from [[atheism]] to Christianity. He bases his case on a moral law, a "rule about right and wrong" commonly known to all human beings, citing the example of [[Nazism]]; both Christians and atheists believed that [[Adolf Hitler]]'s actions were morally wrong. On a more mundane level, it is generally accepted that stealing is violating this moral law. Lewis argues that the moral law is like the [[natural law|law of nature]] in that it was not contrived by humans. However, it is unlike natural laws in that it can be broken or ignored, and it is known intuitively, rather than through observation. After introducing the moral law, Lewis argues that thirst reflects the fact that people naturally need water, and there is no other substance which satisfies that need. Lewis points out that earthly experience does not satisfy the human craving for "joy" and that only God could fit the bill; humans cannot know to yearn for something if it does not exist.&lt;ref name=courseguide&gt;The Life and Writing of C.S. Lewis, Lecture 3; The Great Courses, Course Guidebook; Professor [[Louis Markos]], Houston Baptist University; The Teaching Company; 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

After providing reasons for his conversion to theism, Lewis goes over rival conceptions of God to Christianity. [[Pantheism]], he argues, is incoherent, and atheism too simple. Eventually he arrives at [[Jesus Christ]], and invokes a well-known argument now known as ''[[Lewis's trilemma]]''. Lewis, arguing that Jesus was claiming to be God, uses [[term logic|logic]] to advance three possibilities: either he really was God, was deliberately lying, or was not God but thought himself to be (which would make him [[delusional]] and likely insane). The book goes on to say that the latter two possibilities are not consistent with Jesus' character and it was most likely that he was being truthful.&lt;ref name=courseguide/&gt;

Lewis claims that to understand Christianity, one must understand the moral law, which is the underlying structure of the universe and is "hard as nails." Unless one grasps the dismay which comes from humanity's failure to keep the moral law, one cannot understand the coming of Christ and his work. The eternal God who is the law's source takes primacy over the created [[Satan]] whose rebellion undergirds all evil. The death and resurrection of Christ is introduced as the only way in which our inadequate human attempts to redeem humanity's sins could be made adequate in God's eyes.

God "became a man" in Christ, Lewis says, so that mankind could be "amalgamated with God's nature" and make full [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] possible. Lewis offers several analogies to explain this abstract concept: that of Jesus "paying the penalty" for a crime, "paying a debt", or helping humanity out of a hole. His main point, however, is that redemption is so incomprehensible that it cannot be fully appreciated, and he attempts to explain that the method by which God atones for the sins of humanity is not nearly as important as the fact that he does so.

===''Christian Behaviour''===
The next third of the book explores the [[ethics]] resulting from Christian belief. He cites the four [[cardinal virtues]]: [[prudence]], [[justice]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], and [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]]. After touching on these, he goes into the three [[theological virtues]]: hope, faith, and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. Lewis also explains morality as being composed of three ''layers'': relationships between man and man, the motivations and attitudes of the man himself, and contrasting worldviews.

Lewis also covers such topics as [[social relations]] and forgiveness, [[sexual ethics]] and the tenets of Christian marriage, and the relationship between morality and [[psychoanalysis]]. He also writes about ''the great sin'': pride, which he argues to be the root cause of all evil and rebellion.

His most important point is that Christianity mandates that one "love your neighbour as yourself." He points out that all persons unconditionally love themselves. Even if one does not ''like'' oneself, one would still love oneself. Christians, he writes, must also apply this attitude to others, even if they do not like them. Lewis calls this one of the ''great secrets'': when one acts as if he loves others, he will presently come to love them.

==Cultural impact==
In 2006, ''Mere Christianity'' was placed third in ''[[Christianity Today]]''{{'s}} list of the most influential books amongst evangelicals since 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/october/23.51.html The Top 50 Books That Have Shaped Evangelicals], [[Christianity Today]], 6 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The title has influenced ''[[Touchstone Magazine]]: A Journal of Mere Christianity'' and [[William Dembski]]'s book ''Mere Creation''. [[Charles Colson]]'s conversion to Christianity resulted from his reading this book, as did the conversions of [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]], [[Jonathan Aitken]], [[Josh Caterer]], and the [[philosopher]] [[C.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;M. Joad]].

A passage in the book also influenced the name of contemporary Christian Texan Grammy-nominated pop/rock group [[Sixpence None the Richer]]. The phrase, "the hammering process" was used by the Christian metal band [[Living Sacrifice]] for the name of their album ''[[The Hammering Process]]''. The [[metalcore]] band [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]] derived the title of their song "No Passenger: No Parasite" from the section in the book in which Lewis describes a fully Christian society as having "No passengers or parasites".

Like several of his family he addicted himself partly to the study of [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] philosophy, partly to the science of [[medicine]]. He wrote a treatise upon the works of Epicharmus, in which, on the authority of Epicharmus and [[Pythagoras]] himself, he maintained that the [[Doric Greek|Doric]] was the proper dialect of the [[Orphic]] hymns.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit.

==Biography==
After finishing his A-levels and civilian service, Michael Bordt studied Theology at Philosophy at [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]] and [[Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology|Frankfurt]] and [[Munich School of Philosophy|Munich]] from 1981 to 1988.&lt;ref name=Uniprofile /&gt; His thesis dealt with the topic of the definition of being in [[Sophist (dialogue)|Plato’s Sophist]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In 1993 he finished his studies in Theology in Munich and Frankfurt. In 1997 he received his PhD in Philosophy from [[Oxford University]] for a commentary on [[Lysis (dialogue)|Plato’s Lysis]]&lt;ref name="PlatónBordt1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Platón|author2=Michael Bordt|title=Lysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UDj4Yhz4DCcC|accessdate=27 June 2013|year=1998|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|isbn=978-3-525-30419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  supervised by [[Michael Frede]]. After founding the [http://www.hfph.mwn.de/lehrkoerper/lehrende/bordt/Aristoteleskreis Aristotle circle] in Munich in 1999, he was given a research fellowship at [[Princeton University]] in 2001 where he prepared for his habilitation, which he finished in 2004 at the [[University of Fribourg]] about Plato's Theology.&lt;ref name="Bordt2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Bordt|title=Platons Theologie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSC8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 June 2013|year=2006|publisher=Verlag Karl Alber|isbn=978-3-495-48190-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1997 Bordt has been working at the [[Munich School of Philosophy]] as a professor for [[ancient philosophy]] and [[philosophical Anthropology]] as well as [[aesthetics]] since 2004.&lt;ref name=Uniprofile /&gt; From 2005 to 2011 he was the President of the Munich School of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfph.mwn.de/presse/archiv/2011/pressemappe-zum-praesidentenwechsel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912003300/http://www.hfph.mwn.de/presse/archiv/2011/pressemappe-zum-praesidentenwechsel |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }} President&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he started the Institute for Philosophy and Leadership in Munich.&lt;ref name=Uniprofile /&gt;&lt;ref name=IoPaL /&gt; During the 2013 summer term he is a Visiting Scholar at [[Columbia University]], New York.&lt;ref name=Uniprofile /&gt;

==Work==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2013}}
The philosophical concern of Bordt is to answer the existential questions arising from being human by using the concepts of analytical (especially [[Wittgenstein]]) and [[Ancient philosophy]]. 
Besides his function as a professor of philosophy he gives speeches and workshops for people in leading positions in economy, politics and the church about value-orientated leadership and leadership ethics. He also offers [[meditation]] courses and religious retreats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">In art, '''musivisual language''' is a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] system that is the synchronous union of music and image. The term was coined by Spanish composer [[Alejandro Román]], and for over a century, has appeared in film and other media (television, video or [[multimedia]]). 

== Definition ==
According to Román:

{{quote|''Musivisual Language'' is a special language of music placed in film and from film, understood not only from structural point of view, rhythm and sound-material, but also from the relationships and meaning semiotics in relation to the close interaction with the image and plot.'' |Román, 2008: 84}}

When film music and text connect, they produce meanings distinct from the separate elements. In this communication process, musical codes ([[melody]], rhythm, [[harmony]], sound, [[Texture (music)|texture]], [[Musical form|form]]), in synchrony with the film ([[image]], [[speech]], [[noise]]...) interact. 

Román defines two levels for this language: ''semiotic'', i.e. the contribution of meaning of music over the image, and the specific ''aesthetic'' of film music, which means it has its own stylistic elements not belonging to other musical forms. These elements are determined by the cinematic form.

'''Patrick Aidan Heelan, S.J.''' (17 March 1926 – 1 February 2015) was an Irish-American [[Jesuit priest]], physicist, and [[philosopher of science]]. He was William A. Gaston Professor of Philosophy at [[Georgetown University]].

== Biography ==

Patrick A. Heelan was born in Dublin. He joined the Society of Jesus at 16, received his B.A. in 1947 and his M.A. in 1948, all with first-class Honors, in mathematics and mathematical physics at [[University College, Dublin]] during which time he also worked with [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[John Lighton Synge|John Synge]] at the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] both mathematicians famous for their work in [[General Relativity]] and [[Cosmology]]. In 1948, he won a prestigious fellowship (a Travelling Studentship that paid for doctoral studies abroad anywhere in the world) and his superior directed him to take his doctorate in geophysics and seismology at the Institute of Geophysics at [[St. Louis University]] as a junior Jesuit scholastic, where he specialised in the philosophy of science with a concentration on the [[philosophy of modern physics]] with a novel approach from the phenomenological and hermeneutical perspective of [[Husserl]] and [[Heidegger]].

He then taught physics at UCD for several years before being asked by the Archbishop of Dublin to teach the philosophy of science. Patrick Heelan's sense that he needed more philosophy for this brought him, in two steps, first to an encounter with [[Bernard Lonergan]]'s 1957 book ''Insight'' (starting with the original notes in Latin), and then after a two-year post-doc working with [[Eugene Wigner]] at [[Princeton University]] (1960–62) at the [[Institute for Advanced Studies]], which also gave him, at the start his first experience at [[Fordham University]], Dr Heelan returned to Europe to pursue a second doctorate in philosophy (September 1962 – 1964) at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]] at Leuven (in Belgium) where he worked with [[Jean Ladrière]], studying both logic and Husserlian philosophy (Ladrière would write the biographical entries on Patrick Heelan, including his first book, for the French ''Encyclopédie Philosophique Universelle''). He defended his dissertation (with ''félications du jury'') and published ''Quantum Mechanics and Objectivity'' in 1965 ([[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]], [https://fordham.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=phil_research Table of Contents and Preface]). During the same period he began his visits and correspondence with [[Werner Heisenberg]] himself at the [[Max-Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics]] in Munich, a contact Heelan maintained until Heisenberg's death in 1976.

In 1965, Heelan joined the philosophy department at [[Fordham University]]. He would leave in 1970 at the invitation of [[John S. Toll|John Toll]], then the president of [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], to chair (and to build) the department of philosophy where over the next 22 years he would also fill several major positions in the administration of the University. He published his second major study, ''Space Perception and the Philosophy of Science'' with the University of California Press in 1983, which examines the geometry of vision including the space of art and experience and draws on [[Husserl]], [[Heidegger]], and [[Merleau-Ponty]]. He came to Georgetown University as Executive Vice-President for the Main Campus in 1992 and in 1995, he became the William A. Gaston Professor of Philosophy. The year of 2002, saw the publication of a festschrift, edited by [[Babette Babich]], ''Hermeneutic Philosophy of Science, Van Gogh's Eyes, and God: Essays in Honor of Patrick A. Heelan, S.J.'' which appeared as Volume 225 in the Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science. His third book, ''The Observable'', also edited by Babette Babich came out in 2016 although written almost a half a century before;&lt;ref name="Foreword to The Observable"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/19320529/Foreword_to_Patrick_Aidan_Heelan_The_Observable_Heisenbergs_Philosophy_of_Quantum_Mechanics | title=Foreword to Patrick Aidan Heelan, The Observable: Heisenberg's Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics | publisher=[[Academia.edu]] | accessdate=January 7, 2018 | author=Babich, Babette}}&lt;/ref&gt; completed while Heisenberg was still living, it dealt with Heisenberg, [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] in addition to Einstein.&lt;ref name="The Observable"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/product/31521?format=EPDF | title=The Observable: Heisenberg’s Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics | publisher=PL | author=Heelan, Patrick Aidan | year=2016 | pages=185 | isbn=978-1-4539-1713-8 | editor=Babette Babich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Heelan, who continued to write and to teach until he retired from the philosophy department in 2013, returned to Dublin in 2014. He died in Dublin in 2015.

'''Paul Joseph Salomon Benacerraf''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɪ|ˈ|n|æ|s|ər|ə|f}}; born 1931)&lt;ref name=AAAS /&gt; is a French-born American philosopher working in the field of the [[philosophy of mathematics]] who has been teaching at [[Princeton University]] since he joined the faculty in 1960.  He was appointed Stuart Professor of Philosophy in 1974, and retired in 2007 as the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philosophy.princeton.edu/content/paul-benacerraf-symposium|title=Paul Benacerraf Symposium {{!}} Department of Philosophy|website=philosophy.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Benacerraf was born in Paris to parents who were [[Sephardic]] [[Jew]]s from [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]. In 1939 the family moved to [[Caracas]] and then to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/98/1123/benacer.htm|title='Whatever I am now, it happened here'|last=Moseley|first=Caroline|date=November 23, 1998|work=Princeton Weekly Bulletin|accessdate=October 13, 2011|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

When the family returned to Caracas, Benacerraf remained in the United States boarding at the [[Peddie School]] in Hightstown, NJ. He attended [[Princeton University]] for both his undergraduate and graduate studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Benacerraf is perhaps best known for his two papers "What Numbers Could Not Be" (1965) and "Mathematical Truth" (1973), and for his anthology on the philosophy of mathematics, co-edited with [[Hilary Putnam]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="AAAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother was the [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] [[Nobel Prize]]-winning immunologist [[Baruj Benacerraf]].

==Philosophical work&lt;!--'Benacerraf's epistemological problem' redirects here--&gt;==
In "What Numbers Could Not Be" (1965), Benacerraf argues against a [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonist]] view of mathematics, and for [[Mathematical structuralism|structuralism]], on the ground that what is important about numbers is the abstract structures they represent rather than the objects that number words ostensibly refer to.  In particular, this argument is based on the point that [[Ernst Zermelo]] and [[John von Neumann]] give distinct, and completely adequate, identifications of natural numbers with sets (this argument is called [[Benacerraf's identification problem]]).

In "Mathematical Truth" (1973), he argues that no interpretation of mathematics offers a satisfactory package of epistemology and semantics; it is possible to explain mathematical truth in a way that is consistent with our syntactico-semantical treatment of truth in non-mathematical language, and it is possible to explain our knowledge of mathematics in terms consistent with a causal account of epistemology, but it is in general not possible to accomplish both of these objectives simultaneously (this argument is called '''Benacerraf's epistemological problem'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;). He argues for this on the grounds that an adequate account of truth in mathematics implies the existence of abstract mathematical objects, but that such objects are epistemologically inaccessible because they are causally inert and beyond the reach of sense perception. On the other hand, an adequate epistemology of mathematics, say one that ties truth-conditions to proof in some way, precludes understanding how and why the truth-conditions have any bearing on truth.

== Sexual harassment allegation ==
[[Elisabeth Lloyd|Elizabeth Lloyd]] has alleged that while she was a PhD student at Princeton, Benacerraf "petted and touched" her every day. She said, “It was just an extra price I had to pay, that the men did not have to pay, in order to get my Ph.D.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-higher-ed-s-metoo/241757|title=Tracking Higher Ed’s #MeToo Moment: Updates on Sexual Assault and Harassment|last=|first=|date=1 Dec 2017|website=Chronicle of Higher Education|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211053742/https://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-higher-ed-s-metoo/241757|archive-date=2017-12-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=1 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benacerraf has responded by denying the allegations, stating, “I am not the sort of person that she describes in her interview. Yet I do not doubt her sincerity or the depth of the feelings that she reports.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19268">{{about|the general concept|the 1848 to 1853 conferences in Europe|International Peace Congress}}
A '''peace congress''', in [[international relations]], has at times been defined in a way that would distinguish it from a [[peace conference]] (usually defined as a diplomatic meeting to decide on a [[peace treaty]]), as an ambitious forum to carry out dispute resolution in international affairs, and prevent wars. This idea was widely promoted during the nineteenth century, anticipating the international bodies that would be set up in the twentieth century with comparable aims.

==History==

The genesis of the idea of a [[meeting]] of representatives of different [[nation]]s to obtain by peaceful arbitrament a settlement of differences has been traced to the year 1623 in modern history, to a French monk, [[Émeric Crucé]], who wrote a work entitled "The New Cyneas", a discourse showing the opportunities and the means for establishing a general [[peace]] and [[liberty of conscience]] to all the world and addressed to the monarch and the sovereign princes of the time. He proposed that a city, preferably [[Venice]], should be selected where all the powers had ambassadors and that there should be a [[world government|universal]] union, including all [[people]]s. He suggested careful arrangement as to priority, giving the first place to the pope.

Two years after this publication, in 1625, appeared in Latin the work of [[Hugo Grotius]] "On the Right of War and Peace", pleading for a mitigation of some of the barbarous usages of war.

[[William Penn]]  had a plan for the establishment of a "European Dyet, Parliament or Estates". He was followed by other writers of different nationalities.

The concept of a peaceful community of [[nation]]s had also been outlined in 1795, when [[Immanuel Kant]]’s ''Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |publisher=Mount Holyoke College| title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states.&lt;ref&gt;Skirbekk and Gilje 2001, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

International co-operation to promote [[collective security]] originated in the [[Concert of Europe]] that developed after the [[Napoleonic War]] in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war.&lt;ref&gt;Reichard 2006, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport 1995, pp. 498-500&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the development of international law with the first [[Geneva Conventions]] establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchet-Saulnier, Brav, and Olivier 2007, pp. 14-134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northedge 1986, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The forerunner of the League of Nations, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU), was formed by peace activists [[William Randal Cremer]] and [[Frédéric Passy]] in 1889.  The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of [[parliament]], in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914.  Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration.    The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Before the League of Nations | publisher = The United Nations Office at Geneva | url =http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/B5B92952225993B0C1256F2D00393560?OpenDocument | accessdate =2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congresses==

===Vienna===

After the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France]] an international peace congress took place in [[Vienna]] called the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.

===The Americas in the nineteenth century===

In 1826, a congress composed of representatives of Spanish-American countries was planned by [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]] for military as well as political purposes. One of its declared objects was "to promote the peace and union of American nations and establish amicable methods for the settlement of disputes between them". This congress failed, as only four Spanish-American countries were represented and only one ratified the agreement.

In 1831, however, [[Mexico]] took up the subject and proposed a conference of [[United States|American]] Republics "for the purpose of bringing about not only a union and close alliance for defence, but also the acceptance of friendly mediation for the settlement of disputes between them, and the framing and promulgation of a code of penal laws to regulate their mutual relations". It does not appear that anything came of this congress, and in 1847 another was held at [[Lima]], attended by representatives of [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]], and [[Peru]], for the purpose of forming an alliance of American republics. The United States was invited but as it was then at war with Mexico it sent no representative.

Another congress was held by representatives from the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, and Venezuela, in 1864.

An effort to hold a congress was made by the governments of Chile and Colombia in 1880, "to the end that the settlement by arbitration of each and every international controversy should become a principle of American public law". This congress did not meet, however, owing to a war between Chile and Peru.

In 1881, the [[President of the United States]] invited the independent countries of North and South America to meet in a general congress at [[Washington, D.C.]] on 24 November 1882, "for the purpose of considering and discussing methods of preventing war between the nations of America". This meeting did not take place owing to a variety of reasons, but subsequently, by virtue of an [[Act of Congress of the United States]] an invitation was issued by the president to Mexico, the Central and South American Republics, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Brazil to join in a conference to be held in the city of Washington, the project being to consider:

* (1) measures tending to preserve the peace and promote the prosperity of the South American States;
* (2) measures looking to the formation of an American Customs Union;
* (3) the establishment of regular and frequent communication between the various countries;
* (4) the establishment of a uniform system of customs regulations, invoices, [[sanitation of ships]], and [[quarantine]];
* (5) the adoption of a uniform system of [[weights and measures]], and of laws to protect patent rights, copyrights, and trade marks, and for the extradition of criminals;
* (6) the adoption of a common silver coin;
* (7) the adoption of a definite plan of arbitration of all questions, disputes, and differences; and
* (8) such other subjects relating to the welfare of the several States as might be presented by any of them.

The [[First International Conference of American States]] assembled at Washington on 2 October 1889. Eighteen American nations, including the United States, had their representatives. The conference adopted a plan of arbitration of international differences, together with various recommendations relating to trade, law, extradition, patents, customs, and sanitary regulations. It further declared arbitration to be a principle of American International Law and obligatory "in all controversies concerning diplomatic and consular privileges, boundaries, territories, indemnities, the right of navigation, and the validity, construction and enforcement of treaties; and that it should be equally obligatory in all other cases, whatever might be their origin, nature or object, with the sole exception of those which in the judgment of one of the nations involved in the controversy, might imperil its independence; but that even in this case, while arbitration for that nation should be optional, it should be obligatory on the adversary power" (7 Moore Int. Law Dig. p.&amp;nbsp;7). One notable result of the conference was the establishment of the Bureau of the American Republics. All the republics of South America are represented in this bureau, which continues for periods of ten years subject to renewal.

===American Civil War===

The [[Peace Conference of 1861]] was a last-ditch effort to avert the coming Civil War.

===Friends of Peace===

{{main|International Peace Congress}}
Following an initial congress at London in 1843, an annual series of congresses called [[International Congress of the Friends of Peace]] or more informally "International Peace Congress" were organised from 1848 until 1853.

[[Elihu Burritt]] organized the Congress of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Burritt, Elihu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants met at [[Brussels, Belgium|Brussels]] in September of that year.  Among the distinguished delegates were [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], [[Augustin Thierry|Thierry]], [[Emile de Girardin|Girardin]], and [[Frédéric Bastiat|Bastiat]].  The congress adopted resolutions urging limitation of armaments and the placing of a ban upon foreign loans for war purposes.  Through the next decade, more congresses were convened in various cities without the development of anything new in principle or method.

* 1st congress: [[London]] (1843)
* 2nd congress: [[Brussels]] (1848)
* 3rd congress: [[Paris]] (1849)
* 4th congress: [[Frankfurt am Main]] (1850)
* 5th congress: [[London]] (1851)
* 6th congress: [[Manchester]] (1852)
* 7th congress: [[Edinburgh]] (1853)

===The Hague===
{{main|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907}}

====First Hague Conference====

On 12 August 1898, in a circular letter addressed to the representatives of different nations, the Emperor of Russia proposed to all governments, which had duly accredited representatives at the imperial court, the holding of a conference to consider the problem of the preservation of peace among nations. During the summer of 1900 the conference assembled at [[The Hague]] and on 4 September the formal notification of the ratification of the convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes was given by the [[United States]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Persia]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Siam]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and the [[Netherlands]], and subsequently by [[Japan]]. A [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] was established at The Hague, composed representatives of each of the signatory powers appointed for a term of six years. Arbitrators called upon to form a competent tribunal may be chosen from a general list of the members of the court when any of the signatory powers desire to have recourse to the court for a settlement of any difference between them.

The South and Central American republics were not represented at the conference, but at the second [[International Conference of American States]] which was initiated by President McKinley and held in the City of [[Mexico]], 22 October 1901, to 31 January 1902, a plan was adopted looking to adhesion to The Hague convention, the protocol being signed by all of the delegations except [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]], who subsequently gave their adhesion. The conference authorized the Governments of the United States and Mexico to negotiate with the other signatory powers for the adherence of other American nations. At this conference the project of a treaty for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was adopted, and the signatories agreed for a term of five years to submit to arbitration (preferably to the permanent court at The Hague) all claims for pecuniary loss or damage presented by their respective citizens and not capable of settlement through diplomatic channels, where they were of sufficient importance to warrant the expense of a court of arbitration.

====Second Hague Conference====

A second international peace conference was held at The Hague from 15 June to 18 October 1907. Forty-four States were represented, including the principal nations of Europe, North and South America, and Asia. The conference drew up thirteen conventions and one declaration. They are as follows: for the pacific settlement of international disputes; respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts relative to the opening of hostilities; respecting the laws and customs of war on land; respecting the rights and duties of neutral powers and persons in case of war on land; relative to the status of enemy merchant-ships at the outbreak of hostilities; relative to the conversion of merchant-ships into war-ships; relative to the laying of automatic submarine contact mines; respecting bombardment by naval forces in time of war; for the adaptation to naval war of the principles of the Geneva Convention; relative to certain restrictions with regard to the exercise of the right of capture in naval war; relative to the creation of an International Prize Court; concerning the rights and duties of neutral powers in naval war; and a declaration prohibiting the discharge of projectiles and explosives from balloons.

===International League of Peace and Liberty===

The [[League of Peace and Freedom|International League of Peace and Liberty]] organised a series of international peace congresses.

* 1st congress: [[Geneva]] (1867)

===World War I===

The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], that sought a lasting peace after [[World War I]], approved the proposal to create the League of Nations ([[French language|French]]: ''Société des Nations'', [[German language|German]]: ''Völkerbund'') on 25 January 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Magliveras 1999, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On 28 June 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Magliveras 1999, pp. 8–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northedge 1986, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; the Covenant was signed by 44 states, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] or joined it during the conflict. Despite American President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Levinovitz and Ringertz 2001, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States]] did not join the League.

The League held its first council meeting in [[Paris]] on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty came into force.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1973, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the headquarters of the League moved to [[Geneva]], where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920&lt;ref&gt;Scott 1973, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; with representatives from 41 nations in attendance.

'''Peter Gabel''' (born January 28, 1947) is an American law academic and associate editor of ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'', a bi-monthly Jewish critique of politics, culture, and society and has written a number of articles for the magazine on subjects ranging from the original intent of the framers of the Constitution ("Founding Father Knows Best") to the creationism/evolution controversy ("Creationism and the Spirit of Nature"). Gabel was a founder of the Institute for Labor and Mental Health in [[Oakland, California]], and is close to the [[critical legal studies]] movement. He has published more than a dozen articles in law journals such as the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' and ''[[Texas Law Review]]'', focusing on the role of law in shaping popular consciousness and on how law can best be used to bring about progressive social change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritlawpolitics.org/people/peter_gabel.html The Law for Integrating Spirituality, Law, and Politics ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002034218/http://www.spiritlawpolitics.org/people/peter_gabel.html |date=2008-10-02 }} Retrieved 3/15/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from [[Deerfield Academy]], received his B.A. (1968) and J.D. (1972) from [[Harvard University]], where he served as editor for the [[Harvard Lampoon]], and received his Ph.D. from the [[Wright Institute]] in 1981.

As a teenager he worked as a guide for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], a fact he revealed on the game show ''[[What's My Line]]?'', where he appeared as a guest and stumped the panel, which included his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date= |title=What's My Line?

===Career===
Gabel taught law at [[Boalt Hall]] (the law school of the [[University of California, Berkeley]]) and at the [[University of Minnesota]] before becoming a law professor for 30 years at the [[New College of California School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritlawpolitics.org/people/peter_gabel.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002034218/http://www.spiritlawpolitics.org/people/peter_gabel.html |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }} The Project for Integrating Spirituality, Law and Politics Retrieved 7/24/2011&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as New College's president for 20 years. The college, founded in 1971, was an alternative school in the Mission District that offered undergraduate degrees as well as graduate degrees in psychology and law before its accreditation was revoked and the school was forced to close in June 2008.

Gabel is active in the Project for Integrating Spirituality, Law, and Politics, a group in the San Francisco Bay Area that: "will bring together law teachers, lawyers, and law students in the Bay Area who share our group's aspiration to connect the inner and the outer in a fundamental transformation of legal culture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritlawpolitics.org/executive-committee/2015/8/11/peter-gabel Spirit Law Politics biography] Retrieved 1/25/2017&lt;/ref&gt; He is also strongly focused on communalizing the neighborhood in Noe Valley, San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritlawpolitics.org/pdf/gabel.communalizing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728044849/http://www.spiritlawpolitics.org/pdf/gabel.communalizing.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }} Retrieved 3/15/2009&lt;/ref&gt; One of the group's successful actions was to save a small [[independent bookstore]], Cover to Cover, which was hurt by a publishing slump. Gabel created a group email for neighbors who wanted to help and distributed fliers in the neighborhood, asking neighbors to sign a list pledging to buy a hardback book every month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/06/30/DD198134.DTL Retrieved 3/15/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabel is the bassist in Central Park Zoo, a dance band.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tikkun.org/tikkundaily/contributors/bio-petergabel/ Retrieved 19/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabel has a son, Samuel, with his long-time partner, Unite Here union organizer Lisa Jaicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peter Gabel Co-Chair |url=http://www.spiritlawpolitics.org/executive-committee/2015/8/11/peter-gabel |website=Spiritlawpolitics.org |publisher=PISLAP - Project for Integrating Spirituality, Law and Politics |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social activism===
Since 1968, Gabel has been an outspoken supporter of multiple social causes including [[women's rights]], [[LGBT|LGBTQ+ rights]] and the [[environmental movement]].

In 2015, when receiving his honorary doctorate, he commented how "in 1968 there was a radiant spirit of idealism in the air that drew me into the great social movements of that time—the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam war movement, the women’s movement, the environmental movement, the gay and lesbian movement, all movements that sought to transform the world in a more loving and just direction."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiritlawpolitics.org/news/2015/6/9/peter-gabel-receives-honorary-doctorate-from-san-francisco-state-university&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18171">{{about|the Gnostic philosophical concept|a description of the sewing term "fullness" |Pleat|}}
'''Pleroma''' (Greek {{lang|grc|πλήρωμα}}) generally refers to the totality of divine powers. The word means ''fullness'' from {{lang|grc|πληρόω}} ("I fill") comparable to [[Wikt:πλήρης|πλήρης]] which means "full",&lt;ref&gt;[[Svenska Akademiens Ordbok]], search on the word ''Pleroma'' [http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/189/48280.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in Christian theological contexts: both in [[Gnosticism]] generally, and by [[St. Paul the Apostle]] in {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:9|KJV}} (the word is used 17 times in the NT).&lt;ref&gt;See Strong's #4138: pleroma [http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4138&amp;t=KJV].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pleroma is also used in the general Greek language and is used by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in this general form since the word appears in the book of [[Colossians]]. [[Elaine Pagels]] of [[Princeton University]] views the reference in Colossians as something that was to be interpreted in the Gnostic sense.{{sfn|Pagels|1975|p=137}}

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
The word itself is a relative term, capable of many shades of meaning, according to the subject with which it is joined and the antithesis to which it is contrasted. It denotes the result of the action of the verb ''pleroun;'' but ''pleroun'' is either 
*to fill up an empty thing (''e.g.'' {{bibleverse||Matthew|13:48}}), or 
*to complete an incomplete thing (''e.g.'' {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:17}});

and the verbal substantive in -''ma'' may express either

#the objective accusative after the verb, 'the thing filled or completed,' or 
# the cognate accusative, 'the state of fulness or completion, the fulfilment, the full amount,' resulting from the action of the verb ({{bibleverse||Romans|11:12}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|13:10}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|15:29}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|10:26}}).

It may emphasize totality in contrast to its constituent parts; or fulness in contrast to emptiness (''[[kenoma]]''); or completeness in contrast to incompleteness or deficiency (''hysterema'' {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:24}}, {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|11:9}}, ''hettema'' {{bibleverse||Romans|11:12}}).

A further ambiguity arises when it is joined with a genitive, which may be either subjective or objective, the fulness which one thing gives to another, or that which it receives from another.

In its semi-technical application it is applied primarily to the perfection of God, the fulness of His Being, 'the aggregate of the Divine attributes, virtues, energies': this is used quite absolutely in {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:19}} (''oti en auto eudokesen pan to pleroma katoikesai''), but further defined 
# as ''pan to pleroma tes theotetos'', 'the whole completeness of the Divine nature,' in {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:9}}, 
#as ''pan to pleroma tou theou'', 'the whole (moral) perfection which is characteristic of God,' in {{bibleverse||Ephesians|3:19}}.

Secondarily, this same ''pleroma'' is transferred to Christ; it was embodied permanently in Him at the Incarnation ({{bibleverse||Colossians|1:19}}); it still dwells permanently in His glorified Body, ''en auto katoikei somatikos'' ({{bibleverse||Colossians|2:9}}); it is ''tou pleromatos tou christou'' ({{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:13}}), the complete, moral, and intellectual perfection to which Christians aspire and with which they are filled ({{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:13}}, {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:10}} ''este en auto pepleromenoi''. Cf. {{bibleverse||John|1:16}} ''oti ek tou pleromatos autou emeis pantes elabomen'', where ''pleroma'' is the state of Him who is ''pleres charitos kai aletheias'', {{bibleverse||John|1:14}}, cf. {{bibleverse||Luke|2:40}} ''pleroumenon sophia''). This indwelling emphasizes the completeness with which the Son represents the Father; it is the fulness of life which makes Him the representative, without other intermediary agencies, and ruler of the whole universe; and it is the fulness of moral and intellectual perfection which is communicable through Him to man; it is consistent with a gradual growth of human faculties ({{bibleverse||Luke|2:40}}), therefore with the phrase ''eauton ekenosen'' of {{bibleverse||Philippians|2:7}}, which is perhaps intended as a deliberate contrast to it. One further application of the phrase is made in ({{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:23}}, where it is used of the Church, ''to pleroma tou ta panta en pasin pleroumenou''. Here the genitive is perhaps subjective—the fulness of Christ, His full embodiment, that fulness which He supplies to the Church—emphasizing the thoroughness with which the Church is the receptacle of His powers and represents Him on earth. The analogy of the other uses of the word with the genitive of the person ({{bibleverse||Ephesians|3:19}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:13}}), and the stress throughout these books on Christians being filled by Christ ({{bibleverse||Ephesians|3:19}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:13}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|5:18}}, {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:9}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Colossians|2:10}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Colossians|4:12}}, {{bibleverse||John|1:16}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|3:34}}), favours this view. But the genitive may be objective, 'the complement of Christ,' that which completes Him, which fills up by its activities the work which His withdrawal to heaven would have left undone, as the body completes the head. The analogy of the body, the stress laid on the action of the Church ({{bibleverse||Ephesians|3:10-21}}), St. Paul's language about himself in {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:24}} (''antanaplero ta hysteremata ton thlipseon tou christou''), support this, and it is impossible to decide between the two. The former view has been most common since the thorough examination of the word by Fritzsche{{sfn|Fritzsche|1839|loc=ii. pp. 469ff}} and Lightfoot (''Col.''), and was taken by von Soden (''Hand-Comm.''). But the latter view, which was that of [[Origen]] and [[Chrysostom]], has been strongly advocated  by Pfleiderer,{{sfn|Pfleiderer|1877|loc=ii. p. 172}} and [[T. K. Abbott]] (''International Critical Comm.'').

Outside the NT the word occurs in [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]] in a sense which is clearly influenced by the NT, and apparently in the meaning of the Divine fulness, as going forth and blessing and residing in the Church (''Eph''. Inscr. ''te eulogemen en megethei theou patros pleromati'', and ''Trall''. Inscr. ''en kai aspazomai en to pleromati'', almost = ''en Christo'').

===Gnosticism===
{{see also|Kenoma}}
In [[Gnosticism]] the use becomes yet more stereotyped and technical, though its applications are still very variable. The Gnostic writers appeal to the use in the NT (e.g. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter III.|Iren I. iii. 4]]), and the word retains from it the sense of totality in contrast to the constituent parts; but the chief associations of ''pleroma'' in their systems are with [[Greek philosophy]], and the main thought is that of a state of completeness in contrast to deficiency (''[[Kenoma#Hysterema|hysterema]]'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XVI.|Iren. I. xvi. 3]]; Hippol. vi. 31), or of the fulness of real existence in contrast to the empty void and unreality of mere phenomena (''kenoma'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter IV.|Iren. I. iv. 1]]). Thus in [[Cerinthus]] it expressed the fulness of the Divine Life out of which the Divine Christ descended upon the man Jesus at his baptism, and into which He returned ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXVI.|Iren. I. xxvi. 1]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book III/Chapter XI|III. xi. 1]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book III/Chapter XVI.|xvi. 1]]). In the [[Valentinianism|Valentinian system]] it stands in antithesis to the essential incomprehensible Godhead, as 'the circle of the Divine attributes,' the various means by which God reveals Himself: it is the totality of the thirty [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|aeons]] or emanations which proceed from God, but are separated alike from Him and from the material universe. It is at times almost localized, so that a thing is spoken of as 'within,' 'without,' 'above,' 'below' the Pleroma: more often it is the spirit-world, the archetypal ideal existing in the invisible heavens in contrast to the imperfect phenomenal manifestations of that ideal in the universe. Thus 'the whole Pleroma of the aeons' contributes each its own excellence to the historic Jesus, and He appears on earth 'as the perfect beauty and star of the Pleroma' (''teleiotaton kallos kai astron tou pleromatos'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XI.|Iren. I. xi. 6]]). Similarly it was used by writers as equivalent to the full completeness of perfect knowledge (''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;15).

{{quote|[Some] confess that the Father of all contains all things, and that there is nothing whatever outside of the Pleroma (for it is an absolute necessity that, [if there be anything outside of it,] it should be bounded and circumscribed by something greater than itself), and that they speak of what is ''without'' and what ''within'' in reference to ''knowledge'' and ''ignorance'', and not with respect to local distance; but that, in the Pleroma, or in those things which are contained by the Father, the whole creation which we know to have been formed, having been made by the Demiurge, or by the angels, is contained by the unspeakable greatness, as the centre is in a circle, or as a spot is in a garment .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.|[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book II/Chapter IV.|Iren. II. iv. 2]]}}

Again, each separate aeon is called a ''pleroma'' in contrast to its earthly imperfect counterpart, so that in this sense the plural can be used, ''pleromata'' ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XIV.|Iren. I. xiv. 2]]); and even each individual has his or her Pleroma or spiritual counterpart (''to pleroma autes'' of the [[Samaritan woman at the well|Samaritan woman]],—[[Heracleon]], ''ap.'' Origen, xiii. p.&amp;nbsp;205).

It thus expressed the various thoughts which we should express by the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]], the ideal, heaven; and it is probably owing to this ambiguity, as well as to its heretical associations, that the word dropped out of Christian theology. It is still used in its ordinary untechnical meaning, ''e.g.'' [[Theophylact of Ohrid|Theophylact]] speaks of the Trinity as ''pleroma tou theou''; but no use so technical as that in Ignatius reappears.

====Diagram of the Pleroma====
{{quotation|1=[[File:Pleroma valentina.png|320px|right]]First the • (Point), the ''Monad'', Bythus (the Deep), the unknown and unknowable Father. Then the Δ (Triangle), Bythus and the first emanated pair or ''Duad'', Nous (Mind) and its syzygy Aletheia (Truth). Then the □ (Square), the dual ''Duad'', Tetractys or Quaternary, two males &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the Logos (Word) and Anthrôpos (Man), two females, their syzygies, = Zoê (Life) and Ekklesia (the Church or Assembly), ''Seven in all''. The Triangle the ''Potentiality'' of Spirit, the Square the ''Potentiality'' of Matter; the Vertical Straight Line the ''Potency'' of Spirit, and the Horizontal the ''Potency'' of Matter. Next comes the Pentagram ⋆, the ''Pentad'', the mysterious symbol of the Manasáputras or Sons of Wisdom, which together with their syzygies make 10, or the Decad; and last of all, the Hexalpha or interlaced Triangles ✡ the ''Hexad'', which with their syzygies make 12, or the ''Dodecad''. Such are the Contents of the Pleroma or Completion, the ''Ideas'' in the ''Divine Mind'', 28 in all, for Bythus or the Father is not reckoned, as it is the Root of all. The two small circles ''within'' the Pleroma are the syzygy Christos-Pneuma (Christ and the Holy Spirit); these are ''after''-emanations, and, as such, from one aspect, typify the descent of Spirit to inform and evolve Matter, which ''essentially'' proceeds from the same source; and from another, the descent or incarnation of the Kumâras or the Higher Egos of Humanity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Circle of the Pleroma is bounded by a circumference emanated from Bythus (the Point), this is called the Horus (Boundary), Staurus (Stock, Stake, or Cross) and Metæcheus (Participator); it shuts off the Pleroma (or Completion) from the [[Kenoma#Hysterema|Hystêrema]] (the Inferiority or Incompletion), the larger from the smaller Circle, the Unmanifested from the Manifested. Within the Circle of the Hysterêma is the Square of primordial Matter, or Chaos, emanated by Sophia, called the Ektrôma (or Abortion). Above this is a Triangle, ''primordial Spirit'', called the Common Fruit of the Pleroma, or Jesus, for to all below the Pleroma it appears as a ''unity''. Notice how the Triangle and Square of the Hysterêma are a reflection of the Triangle and Square of the Pleroma. Finally, the plane of the paper, enclosing and penetrating all, is Sigê (Silence).|2=[[G.R.S. Mead]] &amp; [[H.P. Blavatsky]] (after Valentinus){{sfn|Mead|1890|p=237-8}}|source=}}

==Neoplatonism==
In a [[neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] manifestation of the concept, [[John M. Dillon]] in his "Pleroma and Noetic Cosmos: A Comparative Study"  states that Gnosticism imported its concept of the [[theory of forms|ideal realm]] or pleroma from Plato's concept of the cosmos and [[Demiurge]] in [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] and of [[Philo]]'s Noetic cosmos in contrast to the aesthetic cosmos. Dillon does this by contrasting the Noetic cosmos to passages from the [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]], where the aeons are expressed as the thoughts of God. Dillon expresses the concept that pleroma is a Gnostic adaptation of [[Greece|Hellenic]] ideas, since before Philo there is no Jewish tradition that accepts that the material world or cosmos was based on an ideal world that exists as well.{{sfn|Dillon|1992|p=99ff.}}

==Carl Jung==
[[Carl Jung]] used the word in his mystical 1916 unpublished work, [[Seven Sermons to the Dead]], which was finally published in ''[[Answer to Job]]'' (1952), and later in an appendix to the second edition of Jung's autobiography, ''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]'' (1962). According to Jung, pleroma is both "nothing and everything. It is quite fruitless to think about pleroma. Therein both thinking and being cease, since the eternal and infinite possess no qualities."

==Gregory Bateson==
In his work on the Ecology of Mind, [[Gregory Bateson]] adopts and extends Jung's distinction between Pleroma (the non-living world that is undifferentiated by subjectivity) and Creatura (the living world, subject to perceptual difference, distinction, and information). What Bateson calls the "myth of power" is the epistemologically false application to Creatura of an element of Pleroma (non-living, undifferentiated).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4066">"'''Politics'''" is an essay written by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. It is part of his ''Essays: Second Series'', published in 1844.  A premier philosopher, poet and leader of American [[transcendentalism]], he used this essay to belie his feelings on government, specifically American government. His impact on New England thought and his views on pragmatism influenced the likes of [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Orestes Brownson]], and [[Frederich Nietzsche]], among others.

== Summary ==

Although not viewed as his most important essay in the second series, Emerson’s views on politics championed democracy and individualism, two ideas that are viewed today as undoubtedly American. By 1844, Emerson, then 41, had moved into a pragmatic balance of skepticism and idealism, happily providing him with “a way to dream as well as a way to live”.&lt;ref&gt;Spiller, Robert E., J. Lyndon Shanley, Floyd Stovall, Leon Howard. ''Four Makers of the American Mind: Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, and Melville''. Durham, S.C. Duke University Press, 1976: 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A quintessential American voice, Emerson believed that civilization was only beginning and could reach unfathomable places through moral force and creative intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Charles A. and Mary R. ''The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States''. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1942: 188-89.&lt;/ref&gt; This alone is not a reason to blindly follow the footsteps before us. Remember, he says, “The law is only a memorandum.” This gives rise to the most popular quote in this essay: “The less government we have the better.”

Emerson believed that an ideal government, aside from a nonexistent one dissolved when improvements in human character through love and wisdom could abolish the state,&lt;ref&gt;Padover, Saul K. ''The Genius of America: Men Whose Ideas Shaped Our Civilization''. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1960. 191-93.&lt;/ref&gt; was one that advocated for the growth of the individual, and be able to protect one’s individual rights. The individual would only be ready for democracy when they had become completely independent and self-reliant. Then the abolishment of government could be achieved. The intelligence needed from each individual would triumph over business interests and politics, because the mind is the richest asset you can have.&lt;ref name=Leverenz&gt;Leverenz, David. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/462534 "The Politics of Emerson’s Man-Making Words2]. ''PLMA'', Vol. 101, No. 1 (January 1986), 38-56. &lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson also questioned property rights in Politics, noting that they are built not on democracy, but instead on owning. Believing that “property will always follow persons," Emerson believed personal rights were much more important than property rights.

== The State ==

Emerson’s overwhelming faith in the individual is completely opposite to his views on nations: “Every actual state is corrupt.” Political parties are “made out of necessity” of the time period and not out of any underlying theory. Emerson is very critical of both major parties in his essay.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Samuel. ''Discourses in America''. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1906: 169.&lt;/ref&gt; “From neither party, when in power, has the world any benefit to expect in science, art or humanity, at all commensurate with the resources of the nation.” Neither party is satisfactory for Emerson, and his essay he hints at the natural inequality this system adheres to, and its effects.  Party politics are not the only organization Emerson has his eye on in his essay, however. Emerson also distrusts the pulpit and the press because they are conventional roles that require organizational persuasion.&lt;ref name=Leverenz /&gt;

The '''Romeo and Juliet effect''' is when of parental opposition to a relationship intensifies the romantic feelings of those in the relationship. The effect gets its name from the relationship between the protagonists in [[William Shakespeare]]'s late 16th-century play, ''[[Romeo and Juliet]],'' whose families were opposed to their union. The term was coined by Richard Driscoll who was the first author on a research paper which first suggested a there was a real world basis for the effect.&lt;ref name="Driscoll" /&gt; 

==History==
An early review&lt;ref&gt; Derougemont, D. Love in the Western world.(Trans, by M. Belgion) New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; of romantic love in the Western world emphasized the persistent association of obstacles or grave difficulties with the intensity of love, as in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  In 1972, Richard Driscoll; along with Keith Davis and Milton Lipetz, published results from a [[longitudinal study]] on relationships, suggesting an underlying truth to the popular impressions. The research suggests that parental interference in a love relationship can intensify the feelings of romantic love between members of the couple, at least for a brief span of time.&lt;ref name="Driscoll"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Driscoll|first=Richard|last2=Davis|first2=Keith E.|last3=Lipetz|first3=Milton E.|date=1972|title=Parental interference and romantic love: The Romeo and Juliet effect.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/h0033373|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1037/h0033373|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The study interviewed 140 couples, both married and unmarried, via questionnaires and surveys. Couples joined the study to gain more knowledge about the state of their romantic affiliation.  The researchers measured feelings about the spouse, about their perceived love, spousal trustworthiness, neediness, and parental interference. The couples completed these procedures at a first session, and then around 6 months to a year later, completed identical surveying sessions to see how their relationships have endured the past months. About 80% of the original participants completed the second session. Only a small portion of the original sample had ended their relationships or gotten divorced. In the results of the overall study, there was found to be an increase in love ratings for one's partner and parental interference.  Interference did seem to have other frustrating effects, as it also was associated with decreased trust, increased criticalness, and increased frequency of negative, bothersome behaviors.&lt;ref name="Driscoll" /&gt;

==Subsequent development==
Since the original findings of Driscoll's "the Romeo &amp; Juliet Effect,"  studies have attempted to find support of the original research. Although no exact replication has been done of the primary study, many researchers have kept on topic regarding relationship interference and relationship stability. 

In 1983, Malcolm Parks conducted a study to determine influences of peers and families on relationship involvement, which showed little to no support of Driscoll's previous research. Opposition from the partner's family was not associated with greater emotional attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Parks, M.R., Stan, C.M., &amp; Eggert, L.L. (1983). "Romantic involvement and social network involvement." Social Psychology Quarterly, 46(2), 116-131.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings set the path for many other studies on romantic involvement and support systems involvement and approval.

==Contemporary research==
In recent years, much focus has been placed around the topic of a "Romeo and Juliet Effect." In 2001, Diane Felmlee found similar findings to Malcolm Park's study. For instance, perceptions of approval from an individual's friends and approval from a partner's family members reduce the possibility that a relationship will end.&lt;ref&gt;Felmlee, D. (2001). "No couple is an island: A social stability network perspective on dyadic stability." Social Forces, 79, 1259-1287.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Susan Sprecher's study further delved into the subject of the influence of social networks on relationships. It found that individuals from a social network believed that their personal opinions, whether of support or opposition, affected the romantic relationships they had earlier acknowledged as  being in their social networks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  

H. Colleen Sinclair found that friends' approval or disapproval had a great effect on the participants' perception of a potential dating partner. Similarly to the previously discussed studies, Sinclair and colleagues found no significant support for the "Romeo and Juliet Effect."{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Conclusion==
The Romeo and Juliet effect, though found to be supported through early research, in recent years has garnered very little support. Social network, not just parental opinions, do have an effect on a relationship, but different effects than Driscoll claimed. Parental and social network approval greatly increases relationship stability and duration, but disapproval can greatly affect the longevity or outcome of a romantic dating relationship.

==A window of impact==
Why the failures to replicate? The original research indicates that the intensification of romantic love seems to occur within a narrow window, between the time that parents first object and the youngsters unite and stand together, and somewhat later when the youngsters are worn out by the continuing turmoil. The effect may last several weeks or even several months, but it does not continue over longer spans of time and it is not a promising basis for a sound marriage. In Shakespeare's telling of the Romeo and Juliet story -- where the parents never actually learn about the love between the two main characters -- the intense feelings last a mere five days, and would hardly seem to have been the basis for a long and happy union.

{{Gnosticism}}
'''Sarkic''', from the Greek ''σάρξ'', flesh (or '''hylic''', from the Greek ''ὕλη'', stuff, or matter) in [[gnosticism]] describes the lowest level of [[human nature]]&amp;nbsp;— the fleshly, instinctive level.  This isn't the notion of body as opposed to thought; rather the sarkic level is said to be the lowest level of thought.

'''Self-knowledge''' is a term used in [[psychology]] to describe the information that an individual draws upon when finding an answer to the question ''"What am I like?"''.

While seeking to develop the answer to this question, self-knowledge requires ongoing [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]] (which is not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). Young infants and chimpanzees display some of the traits of self-awareness&lt;ref&gt;Gallup, G. G., Jr. (1979). ''Self-recognition in chimpanzees and man: A developmental and comparative perspective''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[agency (philosophy)|agency]]/contingency,&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, N. W., &amp; Ramey, C. T. (1977). Learning to control the environment in infancy. ''Child Development, 48,''806-819.&lt;/ref&gt; yet they are not considered as also having self-consciousness. At some greater level of [[cognition]], however, a self-conscious component emerges in addition to an increased self-awareness component, and then it becomes possible to ask ''"What am I like?"'', and to answer with self-knowledge.

Self-knowledge is a component of the [[Self (psychology)|self]] or, more accurately, the [[self-concept]]. It is the knowledge of oneself and one's properties and the ''desire'' to seek such knowledge that guide the development of the self-concept. Self-knowledge informs us of our mental representations of ourselves, which contain attributes that we uniquely pair with ourselves, and theories on whether these attributes are stable or dynamic.

The self-concept is thought to have three primary aspects:
* The [https://opentextbc.ca/socialpsychology/chapter/the-cognitive-self-the-self-concept/ cognitive self]
* The [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a864/fbfd34426c98b2832a3c2aa9fbc7df8bb910.pdf affective self]
* The [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0010027715000256/1-s2.0-S0010027715000256-main.pdf?_tid=710543c7-e98f-4484-85e2-acf02e7076cc&amp;acdnat=1528121667_89562a04b60eba34b74c91685e1508c9 executive self]

The affective and executive selves are also known as the ''felt'' and ''active'' selves respectively, as they refer to the emotional and behavioral components of the self-concept.
Self-knowledge is linked to the cognitive self in that its motives guide our search to gain greater clarity and assurance that our own self-concept is an accurate representation of our ''true self'';{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} for this reason the cognitive self is also referred to as the ''known self''. The cognitive self is made up of everything we know (or ''think we know'' about ourselves). This implies physiological properties such as hair color, race, and height etc.; and psychological properties like beliefs, values, and dislikes to name but a few.

==Relationship with memory==
Self-knowledge and its structure affect how events we experience are [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]], how they are selectively [[Recollection|retrieved/recalled]], and what conclusions we draw from how we interpret the [[memory]]. The analytical interpretation of our own memory can also be called ''[[meta memory]]'', and is an important factor of ''[[meta cognition]]''.

The connection between our memory and our self-knowledge has been recognized for many years by leading minds in both [[philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1731). ''An essay concerning human understanding.'' London: Edmund Parker. (Original work published 1690)&lt;/ref&gt; and psychology,&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1890). ''The principles of psychology'' (Vol. 1). New York: Holt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kihlstrom, J. F., &amp; Klein, S. B. (1994). The self as a knowledgeable structure. (As cited in Sedikedes, C., &amp; Brewer, M. B. (Eds.), ''Individual self, relational self, collective self.'' (pp. 35-36). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press)&lt;/ref&gt; yet the precise specification of the relation remains a point of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Kihlstrom, J. F., &amp; Klein, S. B. (1997). Self-knowledge and self-awareness. (As cited in Sedikedes, C., &amp; Brewer, M. B. (Eds.), ''Individual self, relational self, collective self.'' (pp. 35-36). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialized memory===
* Studies have shown there is a memory advantage for information encoded with reference to the self.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35''(9),677-688&lt;/ref&gt;
* Patients with [[Alzheimer's]] who have difficulty recognizing their own family have not shown evidence of self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S., Cosmides, L., &amp; Costabile, K. (2003). Preserved knowledge of self in a case of Alzheimer's dementia. ''Social Cognition, 21''(2), 157-165&lt;/ref&gt;

===The division of memory===
Self-theories have traditionally failed to distinguish between different source that inform self-knowledge, these are ''[[episodic memory]]'' and ''[[semantic memory]]''. Both episodic and semantic memory are facets of ''[[declarative memory]]'', which contains memory of facts. Declarative memory is the explicit counterpart to ''[[procedural memory]]'', which is implicit in that it applies to skills we have learnt; they are not ''facts'' that can be ''stated''.

[[File:Schematic memory.JPG|thumb|400px|A basic schematic representation of memory showing the 'locations' of semantic and episodic memory.]]

====Episodic memory====
{{Main article|Episodic memory}}
[[Episodic memory]] is the autobiographical memory that individuals possess which contains events, emotions, and knowledge associated with a given context.

====Semantic memory====
{{Main article|Semantic memory}}
[[Semantic memory]] does not refer to concept-based knowledge stored about a specific experience like episodic memory. Instead it includes the memory of meanings, understandings, general knowledge about the world, and factual information etc. This makes semantic knowledge independent of context and personal information. Semantic memory enables an individual to know information, including information about their selves, without having to consciously recall the experiences that taught them such knowledge.

=====Semantic self as the source=====
People are able to maintain a sense of self that is supported by semantic knowledge of personal facts in the absence of direct access to the memories that describe the episodes on which the knowledge is based.
* Individuals have been shown to maintain a sense of self despite catastrophic impairments in episodic recollection. For example, subject W.J., who suffered dense ''[[retrograde amnesia]]'' leaving her unable to recall any events that occurred prior to the development of amnesia. However, her memory for general facts about her life during the period of amnesia remained intact.
:*This suggests that a separate type of knowledge contributes to the self-concept, as W.J.'s knowledge could not have come from her episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Kihlstrom, J. F. (1996). Self-knowledge of an amnesia patient: Toward a neuropsychology of personality and social psychology. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 125,''250-160&lt;/ref&gt;
:**A similar dissociation occurred in K.C. who suffered a total loss of episodic memory, but still knew a variety of facts about himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E. (1989). Remembering and knowing the past. ''American Scientist, 77,''361-367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E., Schacter, D. L., McLachlan, D. R., &amp; Moscovitch, M. (1988). Priming of semantic autobiographical knowledge: A case study of retrograde amnesia. ''Brain and Cognition, 8,''3-20&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Evidence also exists that shows how patients with severe [[amnesia]] can have accurate and detailed semantic knowledge of what they are like as a person, for example which particular personality traits and characteristics they possess.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Loftus, J. (1993). The mental representation of trait and autobiographical knowledge about the self. (As cited in Sedikedes, C., &amp; Brewer, M. B. (Eds.), ''Individual self, relational self, collective self.'' (pp. 36). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., Chan, R. L., &amp; Loftus, J. (1999). Independence of episodic and semantic self-knowledge: The case from autism. ''Social Cognition, 17,''413-436&lt;/ref&gt;
This evidence for the dissociation between episodic and semantic self-knowledge has made several things clear:
# Episodic memory is not the only drawing point for self-knowledge, contrary to long-held beliefs. Self-knowledge must therefore be expanded to include the semantic component of memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cermack, L. S., &amp; O'Connor, M. (1983). The anteriograde retrieval ability of a patient with amnesia due to encephalitis. ''Neuropsychologia, 21,''213-234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., Wilson, B., Wraight, E. P., &amp; Hodges, J. R. (1993). Neuropsychological and SPECT scan findings during and after transient global amnesia: Evidence for the differential impairment of remote episodic memory. ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, 56,''1227-1230&lt;/ref&gt;
# Self-knowledge about the traits one possesses can be accessed without the need for episodic retrieval. This is shown through study of individuals with neurological impairments that make it impossible to recollect trait-related experiences, yet who can still make reliable and accurate trait-ratings of themselves, and even revise these judgements based on new experiences they cannot even recall.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., Kihlstrom, J. F., 7 Loftus, J. (2000). ''Preserved and impaired self-knowledge in amnesia: A case study''. Unpublished manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives that guide our search==
People have goals that lead them to seek, notice, and interpret information about themselves. These goals begin the quest for self-knowledge.
There are three primary motives that lead us in the search for self-knowledge:
* Self-enhancement
* Accuracy
* Consistency

===Self-enhancement===
{{Main article|Self-enhancement}}
'''[[Self-enhancement]]''' refers to the fact that people seem motivated to experience positive emotional states and to avoid experiencing negative emotional states. People are motivated to feel good about themselves in order to maximize their feelings of self-worth, thus enhancing their [[self-esteem]].&lt;br /&gt;
The emphasis on ''feelings'' differs slightly from how other theories have previously defined self-enhancement needs, for example the ''Contingencies of Self-Worth Model''.&lt;ref&gt;Crocker, J., &amp; Wolfe, C. T. (2001). Contingencies of self-worth. ''Psychological Review, 108,''593-623&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other theorists have taken the term to mean that people are motivated to '''''think''''' about themselves in highly favorable terms, rather than '''''feel''''' they are "good".&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. (1990). To be adored or to be known? The interplay of self-enhancement and self-verification. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburg, M. (1979). ''Conceiving the self.'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In many situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as highly capable or ''better'' than one's peers. However, in some situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as ''average'' or even ''worse'' than others. In both cases, thoughts about the self still serve to enhance feelings of self-worth.
The universal need is not a need to think about oneself in any specific way, rather a need to maximize one's feelings of self-worth. This is the meaning of the self enhancement motive with respect to self-knowledge.

====Arguments====
In Western societies, feelings of self-worth ''are'' in fact promoted by thinking of oneself in favorable terms.
* In this case, self-enhancement needs lead people to seek information about themselves in such a way that they are likely to conclude that they truly possess what they see as a positive defining quality.

See "[[#Self-verification theory|Self-verification theory]]" section.

===Accuracy===
Accuracy needs influence the way in which people search for self-knowledge. People frequently wish to know the truth about themselves without regard as to whether they learn something positive or negative.&lt;ref&gt;Trope, Y. (1986). Self-enhancement, self-assessment, and achievement behavior. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
There are three considerations which underlie this need:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D. (1991). Accuracy and bias in self-knowledge. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Occasionally people simply want to reduce any uncertainty. They may want to know for the sheer intrinsic pleasure of knowing what they are truly like.
* Some people believe they have a moral ''obligation'' to know what they are really like. This view holds particularly strong in [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], particularly [[existentialism]].
* Knowing what one is really like can sometimes help an individual to achieve their goals. The basic fundamental goal to any living thing is survival, therefore accurate self-knowledge can be adaptive to survival.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1954"&gt;Festinger, L. (1954). A theory of social comparison processes. ''Human Relations, 7,''117-140&lt;/ref&gt;
Accurate self-knowledge can also be instrumental in maximizing feelings of self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikedes, C., &amp; Strube, M. J. (1997). Self-evaluation: To thine own self be good, to thine own self be sure, to thine own self be true, and to thine own self be better. ''Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 29''&lt;/ref&gt; Success is one of the number of things that make people feel good about themselves, and knowing what we are like can make successes more likely, so self-knowledge can again be adaptive. This is because self-enhancement needs can be met by knowing that one ''can not'' do something particularly well, thus protecting the person from pursuing a dead-end dream that is likely to end in failure.

===Consistency===
Many theorists believe that we have a motive to protect the self-concept (and thus our self-knowledge) from change.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, S. (1980). The self-concept: A review and the proposal of an integrated theory of personality. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, P. (1945). ''Self-consistency: A theory of personality.'' New York: Island Press&lt;/ref&gt; This motive to have consistency leads people to look for and welcome information that is consistent with what they believe to be true about themselves; likewise, they will avoid and reject information which presents inconsistencies with their beliefs. This phenomenon is also known as [[self-verification theory]].
Not everyone has been shown to pursue a self-consistency motive;&lt;ref&gt;Steele, C. M., &amp; Spencer, S. J. (1992). The primacy of self-integrity. ''Psychological Enquiry, 3,''345-346&lt;/ref&gt; but it has played an important role in various other influential theories, such as  [[Cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). ''A theory of cognitive dissonance.'' Evanston, IL: Row Peterson&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-verification theory====
{{Main article|Self-verification theory}}This theory was put forward by [[William Swann]] of the [[University Of Texas|University of Texas at Austin]] in 1983 to put a name to the aforementioned phenomena. The theory states that once a person develops an idea about what they are like, they will strive to verify the accompanying self-views.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. (1983). Self-verification: Bringing social reality into harmony with the self. (As cited in Suls, J., &amp; Greenwald, A. G. (Eds.), ''Social psychological perspectives on the self, 2,''33-66. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum)&lt;/ref&gt;
Two considerations are thought to drive the search for self-verifying feedback:&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Stein-Seroussi, A., &amp; Giesler, R. B. (1992). Why people self-verify. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62,''392-401&lt;/ref&gt;
* We feel more comfortable and secure when we believe that others see us in the same way that we see ourselves. Actively seeking self-verifying feedback helps people avoid finding out that they are wrong about their self-views.
* Self-verification theory assumes that social interactions will proceed more smoothly and profitably when other people view us the same way as we view ourselves. This provides a second reason to selectively seek self-verifying feedback.
These factors of self-verification theory create controversy when persons suffering from low-self-esteem are taken into consideration. People who hold negative self-views about themselves ''selectively seek negative feedback'' in order to verify their self-views. This is in stark contrast to self-enhancement motives that suggest people are driven by the desire to feel good about themselves.

==Sources==
There are three sources of information available to an individual through which to search for knowledge about the self:
* The physical world
* The social world
* The psychological world

===The physical world===
The physical world is generally a highly visible, and quite easily measurable source of information about one's self. Information one may be able to obtain from the physical world may include:
* Weight - by weighing oneself.
* Strength - by measuring how much one can lift.
* Height - by measuring oneself.

====Limitations====
* Many attributes are not measurable in the physical world, such as kindness, cleverness and sincerity.
* Even when attributes can be assessed with reference to the physical world, the knowledge that we gain is not necessarily the knowledge we are seeking. Every measure is simply a ''relative measure'' to the level of that attribute in, say, the general population or another specific individual.
** This means that any measurement only merits meaning when it is expressed in respect to the measurements of others.
** Most of our personal identities are therefore sealed in comparative terms from the social world.

===The social world===
The comparative nature of self-views means that people rely heavily on the social world when seeking information about their selves. Two particular processes are important:
* ''[[Social comparison theory|Social Comparison Theory]]''&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1954"/&gt;
* ''Reflected Appraisals''

====Social comparison====
{{Main article|Social comparison theory}}
People compare attributes with others and draw inferences about what they themselves are like. However, the conclusions a person ultimately draws depend on whom in particular they compare themselves with. The need for accurate self-knowledge was originally thought to guide the social comparison process, and researchers assumed that comparing with others who are similar to us in the ''important'' ways is more informative.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J. V. (1989). Theory and research concerning social comparisons of personal attributes. ''Psychological Bulletin'', ''106'', 231-248&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Complications of the social comparison theory=====
People are also known to compare themselves with people who are slightly better off than they themselves are (known as an ''upward comparison'');&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. L. (1996). For better or worse: The impact of upward social comparisons on self-evaluations. ''Psychological Bulletin, 119,''51-69&lt;/ref&gt; and with people who are slightly worse off or disadvantaged (known as a ''downward comparison'').&lt;ref&gt;Wills, T. A. (1981). Downward comparison principles in social psychology. ''Psychological Bulletin 90,''245-271&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also substantial evidence that the need for ''accurate'' self-knowledge is neither the only, nor most important factor that guides the social comparison process,&lt;ref&gt;Helgeson, V. S., &amp; Mickelson, K. D. (1995). Motives for social comparison. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21,''1200-1209&lt;/ref&gt; the need to feel good about ourselves affects the social comparison process.

====Reflected appraisals====
'''Reflected appraisals''' occur when a person observes how others respond to them. The process was first explained by the [[Sociology|sociologist]] Charles H. Cooley in 1902 as part of his discussion of the "''looking-glass self''", which describes how we see ourselves reflected in other peoples' eyes.&lt;ref name="cooley1902"&gt;Cooley, C. H. (1902). ''Human nature and the social order.'' New York: Charles Scribner's Sons&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a person's feelings towards themselves are socially determined via a three-step process:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A self-idea of this sort seems to have three principled elements: the imagination of our appearance to the other person; the imagination of his judgment of that appearance; and some sort of self-feeling, such as pride or mortification. The comparison with a looking-glass hardly suggests the second element, the imagined judgment which is quite essential. The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind." (Cooley, 1902, p.153)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In simplified terms, Cooley's three stages are:&lt;ref name="cooley1902" /&gt;
# We imagine how we appear in the eyes of another person.
# We then imagine how that person is evaluating us.
# The imagined evaluation leads us to feel good or bad, in accordance with the judgement we have conjured.
Note that this model is of a [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] nature.

In 1963, John W. Kinch adapted Cooley's model to explain how a person's ''thoughts''  about themselves develop rather than their ''feelings''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinch, J. W. (1963). A formalized theory of self-concept. ''American Journal of Sociology, 68,''481-486&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinch's three stages were:
# Actual appraisals - what other people actually think of us.
# Perceived appraisals - our perception of these appraisals.
# Self-appraisals - our ideas about what we are like based on the perceived appraisals.
This model is also of a phenomenological approach.

=====Arguments against the reflected appraisal models=====
Research has only revealed limited support for the models and various arguments raise their heads:
* People are not generally good at knowing what an individual thinks about them.&lt;ref&gt;Felson, R. B. (1993). The (somewhat) social self: How others affect self-appraisals. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
** Felson believes this is due to communication barriers and imposed social norms which place limits on the information people receive from others. This is especially true when the feedback would be negative; people rarely give one another negative feedback, so people rarely conclude that another person dislikes them or is evaluating them negatively.
* Despite being largely unaware of how one person in particular is evaluating them, people are better at knowing what other people ''on the whole'' think.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, D. A., &amp; DePaulo, B. M. (1993). Do people know how others view them? An empirical and theoretical account. ''Psychological Bulletin, 114,''145-161&lt;/ref&gt;
** The reflected appraisal model assumes that ''actual appraisals'' determine ''perceived appraisals''. Although this may in fact occur, the influence of a common third variable could also produce an association between the two.

The sequence of reflected appraisals may accurately characterize patterns in early childhood due to the large amount of feedback infants receive from their parents, yet it appears to be less relevant later in life. This is because people are not passive, as the model assumes. People ''actively'' and ''selectively'' process information from the social world. Once a person's ideas about themselves take shape, these also influence the manner in which new information is gathered and interpreted, and thus the cycle continues.

===The psychological world===
'''The psychological world''' describes our "inner world". There are three processes that influence how people acquire knowledge about themselves:
* [[Introspection]]
* [[Self-perception theory|Self-perception processes]]
* [[Attribution (psychology)|Causal attributions]]

====Introspection====
[[Introspection]] involves looking inwards and directly consulting our attitudes, feelings and thoughts for meaning.
Consulting one's own thoughts and feelings can sometimes result in meaningful self-knowledge. The accuracy of introspection, however, has been called into question since the 1970s. Generally, introspection relies on people's explanatory theories of the self and their world, the accuracy of which is not necessarily related to the form of self-knowledge that they are attempting to assess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbett|first1=Richard E.|last2=Wilson|first2=Timothy D.|title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1977|volume=84|issue=3|pages=231–259|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.84.3.231}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A stranger's ratings about a participant are more correspondent to the participant's self-assessment ratings when the stranger has been subject to the participant's thoughts and feelings than when the stranger has been subject to the participant's behavior alone, or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, S. M. (1984). Self-knowledge and social inference: II. The diagnosticity of cognitive/affective and behavioral data. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46,''280-293&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparing sources of introspection.''' People believe that spontaneous forms of thought provide more meaningful self-insight than more deliberate forms of thinking. Morewedge, Giblin, and Norton (2014) found that the more spontaneous a kind of thought, the more spontaneous a particular thought, and the more spontaneous thought a particular thought was perceived to be, the more insight into the self it was attributed. In addition, the more meaning the thought was attributed, the more the particular thought influenced their judgment and decision making. People asked to let their mind wander until they randomly thought of a person to whom they were attracted to, for example, reported that the person they identified provided them with more self-insight than people asked to simply think of a person to whom they were attracted to. Moreover, the greater self-insight attributed to the person identified by the (former) random thought process than by the latter deliberate thought process led those people in the random condition to report feeling more attracted to the person they identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morewedge|first1=Carey K.|last2=Giblin|first2=Colleen E.|last3=Norton|first3=Michael I.|title=The (perceived) meaning of spontaneous thoughts.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=2014|volume=143|issue=4|pages=1742–1754|doi=10.1037/a0036775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Arguments against introspection=====
&lt;!-- are these meant to be arguments against the reliability of introspection, or arguments why it's not a good idea to introspect? needs to be made clear --&gt;
Whether introspection always fosters self-insight is not entirely clear. Thinking too much about why we feel the way we do about something can sometimes confuse us and undermine true self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D., &amp; Hodges, S. D. (1992). Attitudes as temporary constructions. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in an introspection condition are less accurate when predicting their own future behavior than controls&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D., &amp; LaFleur, S. J. (1995). Knowing what you'll do: Effects of analyzing reasons on self-prediction. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 68,''21-35&lt;/ref&gt; and are less satisfied with their choices and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D., Lisle, D., Schooler, J., Hodges, S. D., Klaaren, K. J., &amp; LaFleur, S. J. (1993). Introspecting about reasons can reduce post-choice satisfaction. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 19,''331-339&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is important to notice that introspection allows the exploration of the consious mind only, and does not take into account the unconscious motives and processes, as found and formulated by Freud. 

====Self-perception processes====
{{Main article|Self-perception theory}}
Wilson's work is based on the assumption that people are not always aware of ''why'' they feel the way they do. Bem's '''self-perception theory'''&lt;ref&gt;Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-perception theory. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; makes a similar assumption.
The theory is concerned with how people ''explain'' their behavior. It argues that people don't always ''know'' why they do what they do. When this occurs, they infer the causes of their behavior by analyzing their behavior in the context in which it occurred. Outside observers of the behavior would reach a similar conclusion as the individual performing it. The individuals then draw logical conclusions about why they behaved as they did.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Individuals come to "know" their own attitudes, emotions, and other internal states partially by inferring them from observations of their own overt behavior and/or the circumstances in which this behavior occurs. Thus, to the extent that internal cues are weak, ambiguous, or uninterpretable, the individual is functionally in the same position as an outside observer, an observer who must necessarily rely upon those same external cues to infer the individual's inner states." (Bem, 1972, p.2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The theory has been applied to a wide range of phenomena. Under particular conditions, people have been shown to infer their attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J. M., &amp; Hafer, C. L. (1990). Self-inference processes: Looking back and ahead. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; emotions,&lt;ref&gt;Laird, J. D. (1974). Self-attribution and emotion: The effects of expressive behavior on the quality of emotional experience. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29,''475-486&lt;/ref&gt; and motives,&lt;ref&gt;Lepper, M. R., Greene, D., &amp; Nisbett, R. E. (1973). Undermining of children's intrinsic interest with extrinsic rewards: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 28,''129-137&lt;/ref&gt; in the same manner described by the theory.

Similar to introspection, but with an important difference: with introspection we ''directly examine'' our attitudes, feelings and motives. With self-perception processes we ''indirectly infer'' our attitudes, feelings, and motives by ''analyzing our behavior''.

====Causal attributions====
Causal attributions are an important source of self-knowledge, especially when people make attributions for positive and negative events. The key elements in self-perception theory are explanations people give for their actions, these explanations are known as causal attributions.

Causal attributions provide answers to "Why?" questions by attributing a person's behavior (including our own) to a cause.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, B. (1985). An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion. ''Psychological Review, 92,''548-573&lt;/ref&gt;

People also gain self-knowledge by making attributions for ''other people's'' behavior; for example "If nobody wants to spend time with me it must be because I'm boring".

==Activation==
Individuals think of themselves in many different ways, yet only some of these ideas are active at any one given time. The idea that is specifically active at a given time is known as the '''Current Self-Representation'''. Other theorists have referred to the same thing in several different ways:
* The phenomenal self&lt;ref&gt;Jones, E. E., &amp; Gerard, H. B. (1967). ''Foundations of social psychology.'' New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spontaneous self-concept&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, W. J., &amp; McGuire, C. V. (1981). The spontaneous self-concept as affected by personal distinctiveness. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Self-identifications&lt;ref&gt;Schlenker, B. R., &amp; Weigold, M. F. (1989). Goals and the self-identification process: Constructing desired identities. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aspects of the working self-concept&lt;ref name="Markus, H. 1986"&gt;Markus, H., &amp; Kunda, Z. (1986). Stability and malleability of the self-concept. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51,''858-866&lt;/ref&gt;
The current self-representation influences information processing, emotion, and behavior and is influenced by both ''personal'' and ''situational'' factors.

===Personal factors that influence current self-representation===

====Self-concept====
[[Self-concept]], or how people ''usually'' think of themselves is the most important personal factor that influences current self-representation. This is especially true for attributes that are important and self-defining.

Self-concept is also known as the self-schema, made of innumerable smaller self-schemas that are "chronically accessible".&lt;ref name="Markus, H. 1986"/&gt;

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] affects the way people feel about themselves. People with high self-esteem are more likely to be thinking of themselves in positive terms at a given time than people suffering low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D., &amp; Mankowski, T. A. (1993). Self-esteem, mood, and self-evaluation: Changes in mood and the way you see you. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64,''421-430&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mood state====
Mood state influences the accessibility of positive and negative self-views.

When we are happy we tend to think more about our positive qualities and attributes, whereas when we are sad our negative qualities and attributes become more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikides, C. (1995). Central and peripheral self-conceptions are differentially influenced by mood: Tests of the different sensitivity hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69,''759-777&lt;/ref&gt;

This link is particularly strong for people suffering low self-esteem.

====Goals====
People can deliberately activate particular self-views. We select appropriate images of ourselves depending on what role we wish to play in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, M. (1979). Self-monitoring processes (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular goal that influences activation of self-views is the desire to feel good.&lt;ref&gt;Kunda, Z., &amp; Santioso, R. (1989). Motivated changes in the self-concept. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 25,''272-285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situational factors that influence current self-representation===

====Social roles====
How a person thinks of themselves depends largely on the social role they are playing. Social roles influence our personal identities.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B. W., &amp; Donahue, E. M. (1994). One personality, multiple selves: Integrating personality and social roles. ''Journals of Personality, 62,''199-218&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social context and self-description====
People tend to think of themselves in ways that distinguish them from their social surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, L. J., &amp; Miller, D. T. (1995). The distinctiveness effect in social categorization: You are what makes you unusual. ''Psychological Science, 6,''246-249&lt;/ref&gt;
* The more distinctive the attribute, the more likely it will be used to describe oneself.
Distinctiveness also influences the salience of '''group identities'''.
:[[Self-categorization theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S. D., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory.'' Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that whether people are thinking about themselves in terms of either their social groups or various personal identities depends partly on the social context.
* Group identities are more salient in the intergroup contexts.

=====Group size=====
The size of the group affects the salience of group-identities. Minority groups are more distinctive, so group identity should be more salient among minority group members than majority group members.

=====Group status=====
Group status interacts with group size to affect the salience of social identities.

====Social context and self-evaluation====
The social environment has an influence on the way people evaluate themselves as a result of social-comparison processes.

=====The contrast effect=====
People regard themselves as at the opposite end of the spectrum of a given trait to the people in their company.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, S., &amp; Gergen, K. J. (1970). Social comparison, self-consistency, and the concept of the self. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 16,''148-156&lt;/ref&gt; However, this effect has come under criticism as to whether it is a primary effect, as it seems to share space with the assimilation effect, which states that people evaluate themselves more positively when they are in the company of others who are exemplary on some dimension.
* Whether the assimilation or contrast effect prevails depends on the psychological closeness, with people feeling psychologically disconnected with their social surroundings being more likely to show contrast effects. Assimilation effects occur when the subject feels psychologically connected to their social surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, M. B., &amp; Weber, J. G. (1994). Self-evaluation effects of interpersonal versus intergroup social comparison. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66,''268-275&lt;/ref&gt;

====Significant others and self-evaluations====
Imagining how one appears to others has an effect on how one thinks about oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, M. W. (1994). Primed relational schemas as a source of self-evaluative reactions. ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 13,''380-403&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent events====
Recent events can cue particular views of the self, either as a direct result of failure, or via mood.
:The extent of the effect depends on personal variables. For example people with high self-esteem do not show this effect, and sometimes do the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D., &amp; Smart, S. A. (1991). The self and social conduct: Linking self-representations to prosocial behavior. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60,''368-375&lt;/ref&gt;
Memory for prior events influence how people think about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Kunda, Z. (1990). The case for motivated reasoning. ''Psychological Bulletin, 108,''480-498&lt;/ref&gt;
:Fazio et al. found that selective memory for prior events can temporarily activate self-representations which, once activated, guide our behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Fazio, R. H., Effrein, E. A., &amp; Falender, V. J. (1981). Self-perception following social interaction. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41,''232-242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deficiencies==

===Specific types===

====Misperceiving====
*Deficiency in knowledge of the ''present self''.
*Giving reasons but not feelings disrupts self-insight.

====Misremembering====
*Deficiency of knowledge of the ''past self''.
*Knowledge from the present ''overinforms'' the knowledge of the past.
*False theories shape autobiographical memory.

====Misprediction====
*Deficiency of knowledge of the ''future self''.
*Knowledge of the present ''overinforms'' predictions of future knowledge.
*[[Affective forecasting]] can be affected by [[durability bias]].

====Miswanting====

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">The '''Sherman Paradox''' refers to an anomalous pattern of [[Heredity|inheritance]] found in [[Fragile X syndrome]].&lt;ref name=fu&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fu Y, Kuhl D, Pizzuti A, Pieretti M, Sutcliffe J, Richards S, Verkerk A, Holden J, Fenwick R, Warren S |title=Variation of the CGG repeat at the fragile X site results in genetic instability: resolution of the Sherman paradox |journal=Cell |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=1047–58 |year=1991 |pmid=1760838 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(91)90283-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phenomenon is also referred to as anticipation or [[dynamic mutation]].

==Background==

The paradox is named after Stephanie Sherman, who studied the inheritance patterns of people with Fragile X syndrome.  Sherman observed that the effects of Fragile X syndrome seemed to occur more frequently with each passing [[generation]]. This observation is now known as the Sherman Paradox.

The paradox was ultimately explained by insights into the mutation process that gives rise to the syndrome.   Sherman theorized that the [[gene]] responsible for Fragile X syndrome becomes mutated through a two-step process.  The first mutation, called the 'premutation', doesn't cause any clinical symptoms.  A second mutation was required to convert the 'premutation' into a 'full mutation' capable of causing the clinical symptoms associated with Fragile X syndrome.  Additionally, premutations must pass through females in order to transform into the full mutation.

The Fragile X syndrome is so named because of the appearance of the [[X chromosome]] in individuals with Fragile X.  Under an [[electron microscope]], a region on the long arm of the chromosome resembles a thin string. Investigation showed that this region consists of a [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder|CGG repeat triplet]] in both normal and diseased individuals.&lt;ref name=fu/&gt; The difference between normal and diseased is the length of the repeat; the repeat is longer where Fragile X syndrome is present. When the length of the repeat surpasses a critical threshold, symptoms of the disorder appear and they increase in likelihood and severity with further length. Even below this threshold there is a range where the repeat  becomes unstable during [[meiosis]].

In normal individuals, an insertion of extra CGGs is unlikely.  However, as the length of the repeat increases, the [[probability]] of additional triplet insertions increases.  When the expansion reaches the danger range, the carrier is still unaffected, but the risk of further mutation becomes significant.  This is called the premutation range. Once the Fragile X syndrome emerges, symptoms worsen from generation to generation because of the self-promoting aspect of the mutation.

==Triplet repeats and disease==
A similar mechanism, involving triplet repeats, underlies [[myotonic dystrophy]], [[spinocerebellar ataxia]]  and [[Huntington's disease]]. In Huntington's disease, in contrast to Fragile X, somatic as well as germline mutations occur. [[Autopsy|Autopsies]] of affected individuals reveal an accumulation of long repeats of CAG in DNA in the [[striatum]].  In both conditions, effects are less severe if the long repeat is interspersed with other triplets.

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
A '''soup kitchen''', '''meal center,''' or '''food kitchen''' is a place where [[food]] is offered to the hungry usually for free or sometimes at a below market [[price]]. Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, soup kitchens are often staffed by [[Volunteering|volunteer]] organizations, such as [[Church body|church]] or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a [[food bank]] for free or at a low price, because they are considered a [[Charitable organization|charity]], which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.

Many historical and some modern soup kitchens serve only [[soup]] (hence its name) with perhaps some bread. But several establishments which title themselves as a "soup kitchen" also serve other types of food, so social scientists sometimes discuss them together with similar hunger relief agencies that provide more varied hot meals, like food kitchens and meal centers.

While societies have been using various methods to share food with the hungry for millennia, the first soup kitchens in the modern sense may have emerged in the late 18th century. By the late 19th century, they were to be found in several American and European cities. In the [[United States]] and elsewhere, they became more prominent in the 20th century during the [[Great Depression]]. With the improved economic conditions that followed [[World War II]], soup kitchens became less widely used, at least in the advanced economies. In the United States there was a resurgence in the use of soup kitchens following the cutbacks in welfare that were implemented in the early 1980s.

In the 21st century, the use of soup kitchens expanded in both the United States and Europe, following [[2007–08 world food price crisis|lasting global increases in the price of food]] which began in late 2006. Demand for their services grew as the [[Great Recession]] began to worsen economic conditions for those on low income. In much of Europe, demand further increased after the introduction of [[austerity]]-based economic policies from 2010.

==History==
The earliest occurrences of soup kitchens are difficult to identify. Throughout history, societies have invariably recognized a [[moral obligation]] to feed the hungry. The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when one has resources to do so is the most obvious obligation of all. She also said that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], it was believed that people needed to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=[[The Need for Roots]]|page=6|year=2002 |orig-year=1942|isbn=0-415-27102-9|publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soup has long been one of the most economical and simple ways to supply nutritious food to large numbers of people.&lt;ref name ="allAboutSoup"&gt;

Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organisation in the 19th century, most human societies would generally either starve all together or not at all; because, communities would naturally share their food. As markets began to replace the older forms of resource allocation such as [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|Redistribution]], [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|Reciprocity]], and [[Autarky]], society's overall level of food security would typically rise. But food insecurity could become worse for the poorest section of society, and the need arose for more formal methods for providing them with food.&lt;ref name ="GreatTransformation"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Karl Polanyi]]|title=[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]|year=2002 |orig-year=1942|chapter=chpt. 1-5|ISBN=978-0-8070-5643-1|publisher=Beacon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian churches traditionally provided food for the hungry since [[Late antiquity]], with the nourishment mainly provided in the form of [[soup]].

===Emergence of the modern soup kitchen===
[[Image:Count Rumford.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sir Benjamin Thompson, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], 1783.]]
The earliest modern soup kitchens were established by the inventor [[Benjamin Thompson|Sir Benjamin Thompson]], who was employed as an [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] in the 1790s. Thompson was an American loyalist refugee from New England, and an inventor who was ennobled by Bavaria as Count Rumford. The Count was a prominent advocate of hunger relief, writing pamphlets that were widely read across Europe.

His message was especially well received in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], where he had previously held a senior government position for several years and was known as "the Colonel". An urgent need had recently arisen in Britain for food relief, due to its leading role in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]]. While technological development and economic reforms were rapidly increasingly overall prosperity, conditions for the poorest were often made worse, as traditional ways of life were disrupted. In the closing years of the 18th century, soup kitchens run on the principles pioneered by Rumford were to be found throughout [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Scotland]], with about 60,000 people being fed by them daily in [[London]] alone.&lt;ref name="allAboutSoup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CountRumford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/food/2010/12/count-rumford-and-the-history-of-the-soup-kitchen/|title=Count Rumford and the History of the Soup Kitchen|publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|author=Lisa Bramen|date=29 December 2010|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Shadow Behind Our Founding Fathers: A traitor, a scientist, a womanizer and an enigma" review of Nicholas Delbanco's ''The Count of Concord'' '''Book World''' p. 9, 22 June 2008, ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While soup kitchens were generally well regarded, they did attract criticism from some, for encouraging dependency, and sometimes on a local level for attracting vagrants to an area. In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] they were made illegal, along with other forms of aid apart from workhouses, by the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law Amendment Act]] of 1834.{{efn|Note that criticism of soup kitchens was only a minor driver of the 1834 law - the move was driven more by free market ideology and discontent with other forms of "outdoor" aid like the much more widely disliked Speemhanland system, see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom]].}}

During the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish famine]] of the 19th century, in which as many as one million people may have died, the [[British government]] passed the [[Temporary Relief Act]] (also known as the Soup Kitchen Act) in February 1847. The Act amended the restrictions on the provision of aid outside the workhouses for the duration of the famine, and expressly allowed the establishment of soup kitchens in Ireland to relieve pressure from the overstretched [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]] system, which was proving to be totally inadequate in coping with the disaster.&lt;ref name = "Poverty"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwendolyn Mink and Alice O'Connor|title=Poverty in the United States|pages=321–323|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-597-4|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell Bartoletti|first=Susan|title=Black potatoes: the story of the great Irish famine, 1845-1850|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2001|pages=75|isbn=978-0-618-00271-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdmQoaeVuG4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA75&amp;lpg=RA1-PA75&amp;dq=%22Soup+Kitchen+Act%22+1847&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8KuSXfbTHx&amp;sig=KPV_4StEhWpvltXv5_7s161nGbQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OlBrSqmjDJmOjAfihr2eCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prohibition against soup kitchens was soon relaxed on mainland Britain too, though they never again became as prevalent as they had been in the early 19th century, partly as from the 1850s onwards, economic conditions generally began to improve even for the poorest. For the first few decades after the return of soup kitchens to mainland [[Great Britain|Britain]], they were at first heavily regulated, run by groups like the [[Charity Organization Society]]. Even in the early 20th century, campaigning journalists like [[Bart Kennedy]] would criticize them for their long queues, and for the degrading questions staff would ask the hungry before giving out any soup.&lt;ref name ="allAboutSoup"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="GreatTransformation"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;

===Spread to the United States===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen opened by [[Al Capone]] in Depression-era [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the [[United States|US]], 1931.|upright=1.15]]
The concept of soup kitchens spread to the [[United States]] from Ireland after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great famine]] and the concomitant wave of Irish emigration to the [[New World]].&lt;ref name = "Poverty" /&gt; The earliest ones were established in the 1870s. A sharp rise in the number of hungry people resulting from an industrial recession coincided with the success of the  [[Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor|AICP,]] and the American branch of the ''Charity Organization Society'' in getting various forms of "outdoor relief"{{efn|In the main, this meant ending the practice where municipal officials would give out small sums of cash to the poor. Unlike in Britain a few decades earlier, the US did not pass nationwide laws restricting private individuals from giving food to the hungry.}} banned. This resulted in civil society establishing soup kitchens, to help feed those of the poor who did not wish to subject themselves to the regimented organisation of the [[Almshouses]] favored by the charitable societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Todd DePastino]]|title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America|page=22|year=2005|isbn=0226143791|publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ollas comunes en 1932.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Chilean people|Chilean women]] preparing soup kitchen meals in 1932.]]
It is believed the term “breadline” entered the popular lexicon in the 1880s. It was during those years that a noteworthy bakery in New York City’s Greenwich Village, “Fleischmann Model Viennese Bakery,” instituted a policy of distributing unsold baked goods to the poor at the end of their business day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wetsteon |first=Ross |title=Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village, the American Bohemia, 1910–1960 |location= |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=2003 |at=preface |isbn=0-684-86996-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
By the late 19th century  soup kitchens were to be found in several US cities.&lt;ref name="CountRumford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History|chapter=Chpts. 1-3|year=2007|isbn=0674026780|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of soup kitchens hit the mainstream of [[United States]] consciousness during the [[Great Depression]]. One soup kitchen in [[Chicago]] was even sponsored by [[United States|American]] mobster [[Al Capone]] in an effort to clean up his image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/acoffee.html "Soup Kitchens"] ''Social Security Online History Page''.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the improved economic conditions that followed the Second World War, there was less need for soup kitchens in advanced economies.&lt;ref name = "sweet"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Poppendieck|title=Sweet Charity?: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement|chapter=Introduction, Chpt 1|year=1999|isbn=0140245561|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the scaling back of welfare provision in the 1980s under [[Ronald Reagan|president Reagan]]'s administration, there was a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies such as soup kitchens. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks, about 80% of emergency kitchens, and all known food rescue organisations, were established in the US after 1981.&lt;ref name= "sweet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="walter"/&gt; Presently, [[Catholic Charities USA]] of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], founded by [[Sisters of Loretto|The Sisters of Loretto]], provides food to upwards of 600-700 persons or more per day, and has been doing so since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccharitiescc.org/what-we-do/marian-house/soup-kitchen/|title=Marian House Soup Kitchen|author=|date=|website=ccharitiescc.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the 21st century==

Use of soup kitchens has grown rapidly across the world, following the lasting global inflation in the cost of food that began in late 2006. The ''global financial crisis'' further increased the demand for soup kitchens, as did the introduction of austerity policies that have become common in Europe since 2010. Modern soup kitchens are generally well regarded, though like their historical counterparts they are sometimes disliked by local residents for lowering the tone of a neighborhood.&lt;ref name="walter"&gt;{{cite book

=== World's largest soup kitchen===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]] (Kitchen), food is served to all visitors regardless of faith, religion, or background. Only vegetarian food is served and people eat together as equals. The institution of the [[Sikh]] langar, a community run free kitchen, was started by the first Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]]. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality between all people regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender, or social status. In addition to the ideals of equality, the tradition of langar expresses the ethics of sharing, community, inclusiveness, and oneness of humankind. Every Sikh [[Gurdwara|shrine]] has a [[Selfless service|religiously sanctioned moral and humanitarian obligation to serve]] and [[Langar (Sikhism)|provide hospitality, provisions, nourishments and meals]] to any man, regardless of race, creed, religious profession, identification, or affiliation.

=== Comparison with front line food banks and pantries===
[[File:US Navy 090806-N-6220J-004 Sailors and Navy Delayed Entry Program members serve breakfast to homeless men and women at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen in Salinas, Calif. during Salinas Navy Week community service event.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[United States Navy]] serve the homeless at Dorothy's Soup Kitchen, [[Salinas, California]] in 2009.]]
In some countries such as [[UK|Great Britain]], increased demand from hungry people has largely been met by [[food bank]]s, operating on the "front line" model, where they give food out directly to the hungry. In the USA, such establishments are called "food pantries"; Americans generally reserve the term "food bank" for entities which perform a warehouse-like function, distributing food to front line agencies, but not directly to the hungry themselves. Instead of providing hot meals, front line food banks and pantries hand out packages of groceries so that recipients can cook themselves several meals at home. This is often more convenient for the end user. They can receive food for up to a dozen or so meals at once, whereas with a soup kitchen, they typically only receive a single meal with each visit.{{efn|Although some soup kitchens also like to give visitors a second "carry out" meal.}}

Food banks typically have procedures needed to prevent unscrupulous people taking advantage of them, unlike soup kitchens which will usually give a meal to whomever turns up with no questions asked. The soup kitchen's greater accessibility can make it more suitable for assisting people with long-term dependence on food aid. Soup kitchens can also provide warmth, companionship, and the shared communal experience of dining with others, which can be especially valued by people such as disabled, pensioners, widowers, homeless and ex-homeless. In some countries such as Greece, soup kitchens have become the most widely used form of food aid, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' reporting in 2012, that an estimated 400,000 Greeks visit a soup kitchen each day.&lt;ref name = "Poverty"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "walter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==
In the Soviet Union, [[Alexei Starobinsky]] noted that quantum corrections to general relativity should be important for the early universe. These generically lead to curvature-squared corrections to the [[Einstein&amp;ndash;Hilbert action]] and a form of [[f(R) gravity|''f''(''R'') modified gravity]]. The solution to Einstein's equations in the presence of curvature squared terms, when the curvatures are large, leads to an effective cosmological constant. Therefore, he proposed that the early universe went through an inflationary de Sitter era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Starobinsky, A. A. |title= Spectrum Of Relict Gravitational Radiation And The Early State Of The Universe |journal = Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=30 |page= 682 |date=December 1979 |bibcode=1979JETPL..30..682S}}; {{cite journal |title=Spectrum of relict gravitational radiation and the early state of the universe |bibcode=1979ZhPmR..30..719S |journal = Pisma Zh.

V(\phi) = \Lambda^4 \left(1 - e^{-\sqrt{2/3} \phi/M_p} \right)^2

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5619">'''Table setting''' (laying a table) or '''place setting''' refers to the way to set a table with [[tableware]]&amp;mdash;such as [[eating utensil]]s and for serving and eating. The arrangement for a single diner is called a place setting.  The practice of dictating the precise arrangement of tableware has varied across cultures and historical periods.
[[File:Silbertafel Reiss 3 rem.jpg|thumb|A table setting may have many elements, especially on formal occasions; the long utensil is a lobster pick.]]

==Place setting==
Informal settings generally have fewer utensils and dishes but use a layout based on more formal settings. [[food utensil|Utensil]]s are arranged in the order and according to the manner in which the diner will use them.  In the [[West]], [[fork]]s, plate, butter knife, and [[napkin]] generally are placed to the left of the dinner plate, and [[knife|knives]], [[spoon]]s, [[drinkware|stemware and tumblers]], [[Teacup|cups]], and [[saucer]]s to the right.  (By contrast, formal settings in Armenia place the fork to the right of the dinner plate and informal settings in Turkey place the fork to the right of the dinner plate if not accompanied by a knife)  [[sauce boat|Sauceboats]] and serving dishes, when used, either are placed on the table or, more formally, may be kept on a side table.

===Informal===
[[File:Table_setting_with_pancakes_in_a_California_mountain_cabin,_2009.jpg|thumb|right|Informal setting with pancakes in a California mountain cabin.]]
At an informal setting, fewer utensils are used and serving dishes are placed on the table. Sometimes the cup and saucer are placed on the right side of the spoon, about 30cm or 12 inches from the edge of the table. Often, in less formal settings, the napkin should be in the wine glass.  However, such objects as napkin rings are very rare in the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, or Italy.

===Formal===
[[File:Formal 01.jpg|thumb|A formal table setting for one person.]]
Utensils are placed inward about 20cm or 8 inches from the edge of the table, with all placed either upon the same invisible baseline or upon the same invisible median line.  Utensils in the outermost position are to be used first (for example, a [[soup spoon]] or a salad fork, later the dinner fork and the dinner knife).  The blades of the knives are turned toward the plate.  Glasses are placed an inch (2.5 cm) or so above the knives, also in the order of use:  white wine, red wine, dessert wine, and water tumbler.

====Formal dinner====
[[File:Imaginative_formal_dinner_party_sketched_by_Marguerite_Martyn_in_1920.jpg|thumb|right|Place settings are conspicuous in this 1920 sketch by reporter-artist [[Marguerite Martyn]] of the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch.'']]
The most formal dinner is served from the kitchen.  When the meal is served, in addition to the central plate (a [[Charger (table setting)|service plate]] or dinner plate at supper; at luncheon, a service plate or luncheon plate) at each place there are a bread roll (generally on a bread plate, sometimes in the napkin), napkin, and flatware (knives and spoons to the right of the central plate, and forks to the left).  Coffee is served in Butler Service style in [[demitasse]]s, and a spoon placed on the saucer to the right of each handle.  Serving dishes and utensils are not placed on the table for a formal dinner.&lt;ref name=vanderbilt&gt;{{cite book |last=Vanderbilt |first=Amy |title= Amy Vanderbilt's Complete Book of Etiquette: a Guide to Gracious Living |year=1958 |publisher= Doubleday &amp; Co. |location= Garden City, NY |pages= 346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only exception in the West to these general rules is the protocol followed at the Spanish royal court, which was also adopted by the Austrian court, in which all cutlery was placed to the right of the central plate for each diner.

At a less formal dinner, not served from the kitchen, the dessert fork and spoon can be set above the plate, fork pointing right, spoon pointing left.&lt;ref name=post75&gt;{{cite book |last=Post |first=Peggy |title= Emily Post's Etiquitte 75th Anniversary Edition |year=1997 |publisher= Harper-Collins |location= Table Settings |isbn= 006270078-2 |pages=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Growth of Biological Thought''''' (992 pages, [[Belknap Press]], {{ISBN|0674364465}}) is a book written by [[Ernst Mayr]], first published in [[1982 in literature|1982]].  It is subtitled '''Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance''', and is as much a book of [[philosophy]] and [[history]] as it is of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674364462|title=The Growth of Biological Thought — Ernst Mayr|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a sweeping, academic study of the first 2,400 years of the [[science]] of [[biology]].  It focuses largely on how the philosophical assumptions of biologists influenced and limited their understanding.  It includes many important general observations about the role of philosophy in scientific inquiry and the place of biology amongst the sciences.

'''''The Power of the Rosary''''' is a book on [[Catholic]] themes by Reverend Albert J. M. Shamon.

The book revolves around the topic of [[Catholic beliefs on the power of prayer]] via the [[rosary]]. It builds on the [[fifteen rosary promises]] and extends the discussion to the present day. It discusses that the rosary has been featured prominently in the context of several [[Marian apparition]]s such as those in [[Međugorje]] and [[Our Lady of Fatima]]. It also recounts many anecdotal incidents regarding the rosary, ranging from religious and political prisoners in China to every day Catholics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3693">In Christianity, a '''three-day movement''' is an organisation that conducts retreats to enrich the lives of other Christians, consisting of people who have themselves attended such a retreats. Alternatively, these organisations taken together may be referred to as ''the three day movement''.

Most but not all of these retreats cover three days, and so the '''fourth day''' has become a term used by these movements to describe the life of the attendee after the retreat. 

The original three day movement, [[Cursillo]], began in the [[Roman Catholic]] church in [[Spain]] in 1944, and spread to other countries. Although Cursillo was and is structured so as not to restrict participation to members of the Roman Catholic Church, in time people who had attended Cursillo founded similar programs tailored to specific groups, including programs for younger people, those in prison or affected by the incarceration of another, and members of specific denominational groups. Some of these have licensed the Cursillo material and use its name, while others have developed similar programs under another name.

All such organisations are now known as ''three-day movements'' or parts of the ''three-day movement'', whether or not their programs actually run for three days. A feature of the three day movement is the support these different organisations continue to provide for each other, particularly in each supporting the programs run by other organisations in prayer and by sending letters and other expressions of support. And, although particular organisations remain linked to denominational groups, there is generally no denominational requirement for participants.

Three day movement programs include:

* [[Cursillo]].
** [[Anglicanism|Episcopal]] Cursillo, known in some countries as ''[[Anglican]] Cursillo''.
** [[Lutheran]] Via de Cristo.
** [[Chayah]], a ministry to young jail inmates based on Lutheran Cursillo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23399">'''"Tone at the top"''' is a term that originated in the field of [[accounting]] and is used to describe an organization's general ethical climate, as established by its board of directors, audit committee, and senior management. Having good tone at the top is believed by business ethics experts to help prevent fraud and other unethical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TONE AT THE TOP Definition|url=http://www.ventureline.com/accounting-glossary/T/tone-at-the-top-definition/|publisher=VentureLine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=David A.|title=An Examination of How Entry-Level Staff Auditors Respond to Tone at the Top vis-à-vis Tone at the Bottom|journal=Behavioral Research in Accounting|date=Spring 2015|volume=27|issue=1|url=http://www.aaajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2308/bria-50918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The concept of tone at the top originated in [[Big Four (audit firms)|audit firms]], where it referred fairly narrowly to the attitude of an organization's senior leadership towards [[Internal control|internal financial controls]]. It was popularized following a series of major [[corporate accounting scandals]] such as those affecting [[Enron]], [[Tyco International]], [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]], [[Peregrine Systems]] and [[WorldCom]], when the concept was strongly emphasized in the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002]] as important in the prevention and detection of [[fraud]] and other unethical financial practices. Today the term is applied very broadly, including in the fields of general management, [[information security]], law and [[software development]], and is often used to describe the general corporate culture established by an organization's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krause|first=edited by Harold F. Tipton, Micki|title=Information security management handbook, v. 3|year=2000|publisher=Auerbach|location=Boca Raton, Fl|isbn=1420090925|pages=133–134|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Terry|title=Your Time or Your Money: Groundswell supports less billable hours, alternate tracks to the top|newspaper=The ABA Journal {{!}} The lawyer's magazine|date=February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=William E.|title=Effective methods for software testing|year=2006|publisher=Wiley Publishing|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|isbn=0764598376|pages=51 and 60|edition=3rd ed. --}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The tone at the top is often considered to permeate an entire organization, and good tone at the top is considered a prerequisite for solid [[corporate governance]]. It has been said that [[Board of directors|boards of directors]] have a dual role: creating codes of conduct, and living by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Regan|first=David|title=Auditor's Dictionary: Terms, Concepts, Processes, and Regulations.|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|location=New York|isbn=0471531189|pages=257|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Good organizational tone is set through policies, codes of ethics, a commitment to hiring competent employees, and the development of [[reward structures]] that promote good internal controls and effective governance. In an analysis of ethical leadership, [[KPMG]] described ethical leaders as those who are receptive to employees' ethical concerns, value ethics and integrity over short-term business goals, and respond appropriately if they become aware of misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Leonard J. Brooks, Paul|title=Business &amp; professional ethics for directors, executives, &amp; accountants|year=2010|publisher=South Western Cengage Learning|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0324594550|pages=261|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditors typically interview an organization's leaders as part of the [[audit fieldwork]] in order to assess tone at the top, because poor tone is associated with malfeasance. Questions commonly asked include "how is the board compensated," "how active is the [[audit committee]]," "what is the nature of the organization's [[corporate culture]]," "what pressures are there to make [[sales targets|sales and earnings goals]]," "how is wrong-doing dealt with," "do employees understand their individual responsibilities for controls," "do monitoring controls signal failures in a timely fashion so corrective action can be taken," and "is there evidence that the employee [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] is complied with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnstone|first=Larry E. Rittenberg, Bradley J. Schwieger, Karla M.|title=Auditing: a business risk approach|year=2008|publisher=Thomson/South-Western|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0324375581|pages=353–354|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important fraud factors include pressure to reach goals, incentives and meeting expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Management can prevent fraud in the Workplace|url=http://www.acfe.com/uploadedFiles/ACFE_Website/Content/documents/tone-at-the-top-research.pdf|publisher=Association of Certified Fraud Examiners|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failures==
Experts say that weaknesses in the "tone at the top" have been associated with most modern financial frauds. Poor tone at the top may include a disdain for [[internal control]]s, an overemphasis on [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] at the expense of [[Business ethics|ethics]], a belief that [[Legal governance, risk management, and compliance#Legal compliance|compliance with the law]] is sufficient for defensible ethical conduct, the canvassing and accommodating of some [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] but not others, blaming higher-ups or colleagues for unethical practices, having one's judgement clouded due to [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], and a misunderstanding of and lack of adherence to public expectations of what constitutes ethical behaviour for executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gramling|first=Larry E. Rittenberg, Karla M. Johnstone, Audrey A.|title=Auditing: a business risk approach|year=2010|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0324658044|pages=195 and 233|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Leonard J.

===Examples of failed tone at the top===

====The Enron scandal====
The [[Enron scandal]], revealed in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the [[Enron Corporation]], an American energy company based in [[Houston Texas|Houston, Texas]], and the de facto dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], its audit firm. Enron is considered to be the largest [[bankruptcy]] reorganization in U.S. history, as well as the biggest audit failure.&lt;ref name="DarkSide61"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratton|first=William W.|title=Does Corporate Law Protect the Interests of Shareholders and Other Stakeholders?: Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value|journal=[[Tulane Law Review]]|volume=|issue=1275|page=61|publisher=[[Tulane University Law School]]|location=New Orleans|date=May 2002|ssrn=301475|format=PDF|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executives at Enron used [[Creative accounting|accounting loopholes]], [[special purpose entities]], and misleading [[financial reporting]] to hide billions in debt from failed deals and projects. [[Chief Financial Officer]] [[Andrew Fastow]] and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk [[Standard accounting practice|accounting practices]], but also pressured Andersen to ignore the issues. The Enron story demonstrated many common features of failed tone at the top, including inappropriate hostility to critics and a misunderstanding of public expectations. In a conference call on April 17, 2001, after [[Wall Street]] [[Business analyst|analyst]] [[Richard Grubman]] complained that Enron wasn't releasing a [[balance sheet]] along with its [[financial statements]], then-CEO [[Jeffrey Skilling]] responded "Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that ... asshole," a phrase that was met with dismay and astonishment by the media and public, but which became an inside joke among many Enron employees.&lt;ref name="million"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pasha|first=Shaheen|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/04/10/news/newsmakers/enron_trial/index.htm|publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]]|title=Skilling comes out swinging|date=2006-04-10|accessdate=2010-10-17|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2GOn06|archivedate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WellThankYou"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tolson|first=Mike|author2=Katherine Feser |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/jenny/2404018.html|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|title=Jeff Skilling's spectacular career|date=2004-06-20|accessdate=2010-10-17|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2J4D0c|archivedate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EmpAskWhy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Niles|first=Sam|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/10/ceo-anger-management-ceonetwork-leadership-outbursts_slide_2.html|work=[[Forbes]]|title=In Pictures: 10 All-Time Great CEO Outbursts: Jeffrey Skilling|date=2009-07-10|accessdate=2010-10-17|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2MXiZi|archivedate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arthur Andersen obstruction of justice====
[[Arthur Andersen]] was criticized for being the only [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big 5]] audit firm to allow the partner in charge of an audit to override a ruling made by the quality control partner, and was found guilty in 2002 of obstruction of justice for shredding documents related to its audit of Enron, resulting in the Enron scandal. The Arthur Andersen story is now used in business ethics textbooks as an example of a failure of tone at the top, for emphasizing profitability over high ethical standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Leonard J. Brooks, Paul|title=Business &amp; professional ethics for directors, executives, &amp; accountants|year=2010|publisher=South Western Cengage Learning|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0324594550|pages=117–123|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also [[Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States]] and the [[Enron scandal]].''

====Xerox fined by SEC====
In 2002, [[Xerox]] was fined $10 million by the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) for allegedly deceiving the public between 1997 and 2000 by employing several "accounting maneuvers," with six Xerox senior executives paying another $22 million in 2003. The SEC charged that former CEO [[Paul Allaire]] and his second-in-command [[G. Richard Thoman]], who were among the six fined, "set a tone at the top of the company which equated business success with meeting short-term earnings targets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=Jerry W.|title=A financial history of modern U.S. corporate scandals: from Enron to reform|year=2005|publisher=Sharpe|location=Armonk, N.Y. [u.a.]|isbn=0765615835|pages=224|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandals at Fannie Mae====
Business experts say that although the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), colloquially known as [[Fannie Mae]], gave the appearance of setting the appropriate tone at the top, its actual conduct fell short. In 2004, Fannie Mae was investigated by the U.S. [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]] (OFHEO), which alleged widespread accounting errors. In 2008 Fannie Mae was embroiled in several conflict of interest scandals, and in 2011 six of its executives, including 2005-2008 Fannie Mae CEO [[Daniel Mudd]], were charged by the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] with [[securities fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cristie|first=James R.

Ego and arrogance was visible everywhere, in everything the company did: how it treated counterparties in the marketplace it dealt in, how it was able to throw its weight around politically, the way it spent money to curry political loyalty, the arrogance that permeated everything that the company did, including ultimately the accounting misconduct, and the lack of any kind of corporate ethics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=John|title=Money for nothing: how the failure of corporate boards is ruining American business and costing us trillions|year=2010|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=1416559930|pages=124–125|edition=1st Free Press hardcover|author2=Zweig, David }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also the [[Fannie Mae#Accounting controversy|2004 Fannie Mae accounting controversy]], the [[Countrywide financial political loan scandal|Countrywide Financial political loan scandal]] and [[Angelo Mozilo#.22Friends of Angelo .28FOA.29.22 VIP program|Friends of Angelo VIP program]], and the [[Fannie Mae#2011 SEC charges|2011 Fannie Mae SEC charges]].''

====Global financial crisis====
The [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]], considered by many [[economist]]s to be the worst [[financial crisis]] since the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS193520+27-Feb-2009+BW20090227 Two top economists agree 2009 worst financial crisis since great depression; risks increase if right steps are not taken.] (February 29, 2009). ''[[Reuters]]''. Retrieved 2009-09-30, from [[Business Wire|Business Wire News]] database.&lt;/ref&gt; was investigated by the U.S. [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], which concluded that "the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve’s failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcic.gov/files/news_pdfs/2011-0127-fcic-releases-report.pdf Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission – Press Release – January 27, 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130170725/http://www.fcic.gov/files/news_pdfs/2011-0127-fcic-releases-report.pdf |date=January 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://c0182732.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/fcic_final_report_conclusions.pdf FCIC Report-Conclusions Excerpt-January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and laid the blame for the crisis with government and regulatory leaders and CEOs of the failed companies, saying "tone at the top does matter and, in this instance, we were let down.

====[[Tyco International#Corporate scandal of 2002|Tyco Scandal]]====
{{Main|Tyco International#Corporate scandal of 2002}}

Former [[chairman]] and [[chief executive]] [[Dennis Kozlowski]] and former [[chief financial officer]] Mark H. Swartz were accused of the theft of more than $150 million from the company. During their trial in March 2004, they contended the board of directors authorized it as compensation.

During jury deliberations, juror Ruth Jordan, while passing through the courtroom, appeared to make an [[A-ok|"okay" sign]] with her fingers to the defense table. She later denied she had intended that gesture, but the incident received much publicity (including a caricature in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''), and the juror received threats after her name became public. Judge Michael Obus declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] on April 2, 2004.

On June 17, 2005, after a retrial, Kozlowski and Swartz were convicted on all but one of the more than 30 counts against them. The verdicts carry potential jail terms of up to 25 years in state prison. Kozlowski himself was sentenced to no less than eight years and four months and no more than 25 years in prison. Swartz received the same sentence. Then in May 2007, [[New Hampshire]] Federal District Court Judge [[Paul Barbadoro]] approved a class action settlement whereby Tyco agreed to pay $2.92 billion (in conjunction with $225 million by [[Pricewaterhouse Coopers]], their auditors) to a class of defrauded shareholders represented by [[Grant &amp; Eisenhofer P.A.]], Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz &amp; Kessler, and Milberg Weiss &amp; Bershad.

====[[MCI Inc.|MCI Inc/WorldCom]]====
{{Main|MCI_Inc.#Accounting_scandals}}

CEO Bernard Ebbers was accused of accounting fraud.&lt;ref name=sec&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723527/000093176303001862/dex991.htm|title=Report of Investigation by The Special Investigative Committee of the Board of Directors of Worldcom, Inc.|publisher=SEC| accessdate=2008-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebbers had become very wealthy from the rising price of his holdings in WorldCom common stock.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt; However, in the year 2000, the telecommunications industry entered a downturn &lt;!-- page 33 of Worldcom report --&gt;and WorldCom’s aggressive growth strategy suffered a serious setback when it was forced by the US Justice Department to abandon its proposed merger with Sprint in mid 2000.&lt;ref name="sec"/&gt;  By that time, WorldCom’s stock price was declining and Ebbers came under increasing pressure from banks to cover [[margin call]]s on his WorldCom stock that was used to finance his other businesses (timber and yachting, among others).&lt;ref name=sec /&gt; During 2001, Ebbers persuaded WorldCom’s board of directors to provide him corporate loans and guarantees in excess of $400 million to cover his margin calls.&lt;ref name=sec /&gt; The board hoped that the loans would avert the need for Ebbers to sell substantial amounts of his WorldCom stock, as his doing so would put further downward pressure on the stock's price. However, this strategy ultimately failed and Ebbers was ousted as CEO in April 2002 and replaced by [[John W. Sidgmore|John Sidgmore]], former [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[UUNET]] Technologies, Inc.

Beginning modestly in mid-year 1999 and continuing at an accelerated pace through May 2002, the company (under the direction of Ebbers, [[Scott Sullivan (executive)|Scott Sullivan]] (CFO), David Myers ([[Comptroller]]) and Buford "Buddy" Yates (Director of General Accounting)) used fraudulent accounting methods to mask its declining earnings by painting a false picture of financial growth and profitability to prop up the price of WorldCom’s stock.&lt;ref name=sec /&gt;

The fraud was accomplished primarily in two ways:

#Booking ‘line costs’ (interconnection expenses with other telecommunication companies) as [[capital expenditure|capital]] on the balance sheet instead of [[expense]]s.
#Inflating revenues with bogus accounting entries from "corporate unallocated revenue accounts".

In 2002, a small team of internal auditors at WorldCom worked together, often at night and in secret, to investigate and unearth $3.8 billion in fraud.&lt;ref name=WallStreetJournal&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan |last=Pulliam |author2=Deborah Soloman  |title=How Three Unlikely Sleuths Exposed Fraud at WorldCom: Firm's Own Employees Sniffed Out Cryptic Clues and Followed Hunches |url=http://www.happinessonline.org/MoralCode/LiveWithTruth/p23.htm |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time2002b&gt;{{cite news |first=Amanda |last=Ripley |authorlink=Amanda Ripley |title=The Night Detective |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003990,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2008-11-08 | date=December 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ExtraCircPatsyLee&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper|first=Cynthia |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Extraordinary Circumstances: The Journey of a Corporate Whistleblower |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0470124296/ref=sib_dp_pt# |accessdate=2008-11-08|series= |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] |location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] |isbn=9780470124291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the company’s audit committee and board of directors were notified of the fraud and acted swiftly:  Sullivan was fired, Myers resigned, [[Arthur Andersen]] withdrew its audit opinion for 2001, and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) launched an investigation into these matters on June 26, 2002 (see [[accounting scandals]]). By the end of 2003, it was estimated that the company's total assets had been inflated by around $11 billion.&lt;ref name=sec /&gt;

====[[ImClone Systems]] trading case====
{{Main|ImClone stock trading case}}

ImClone's stock price dropped sharply at the end of 2001 when its drug [[Cetuximab|Erbitux]], an experimental [[monoclonal antibody]], failed to get the expected [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval. It was later revealed by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] that numerous executives sold their stock before the announcement of the decision after the close of trading on December 28.

Its founder, [[Samuel D. Waksal]], was arrested in 2002 on [[insider trading]] charges for informing friends and family to sell their stock, and attempting to sell his own. His daughter, Aliza Waksal, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 27. His father, Jack Waksal, sold $8.1 million in shares over the 27th and 28th. Company executives had done the same. [[John B. Landes]], the general counsel, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 6. [[Ronald A. Martell]], the vice president for marketing and sales, sold $2.1 million in shares on December 11. Four other executives sold shares in the following weeks as well. Later, Samuel Waksal pleaded guilty to various charges, including [[securities fraud]], and on June 10, 2003, was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.

A '''wooden fish''', also known as a '''Chinese temple block.'''&lt;ref name=bl92-115&gt;{{cite book|last=Blades|first=James|title=Percussion instruments and their history|year=1992|publisher=Bold Strummer|location=Westport|isbn=9780933224612|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joseph |last1=Adato |first2= George |last2=Judy|title=The Percussionist's Dictionary: Translationas, Descriptions and Photographs of Persussion Instruments from Around the World|year=1985|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|isbn=9781457493829|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a wooden [[percussion]] instrument. The wooden fish is used by monks and lay people in the [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] tradition. It is often used during rituals usually involving the recitation of [[sutra]]s, [[mantra]]s, or other [[Buddhist texts]]. The wooden fish is mainly used by Buddhist disciples in  [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and other [[East Asian]] countries where the practice of Mahayana, such as the ceremonious reciting of sutras, is prevalent. In most [[Zen]]/[[Ch'an]] Buddhist traditions, the wooden fish serves to keep the rhythm during sutra chanting. In [[Pure Land Buddhism]], it is used when chanting the name of [[Amitabha]].

The [[Taoist]] clergy has also adapted the wooden fish into their rituals.

==Types of wooden fish==
There are two kinds of wooden fish.

Most commonly today, it is the traditional instrument that is round in shape and often made out of wood, but sometimes other materials are used as well; this form is actually a later development from the original. The fish is hollow with a ridge outside of the wooden fish to help provide the genuine hollow sound when striking the fish; the instrument is similarly shaped like a [[jingle bell]]. The sound can differ amongst wooden fish depending on the size, type of wood used, and how hollow the wooden fish is. The instrument is carved with fish scales on its top, and a carving of two fish heads embracing a [[pearl]] on the handle (to symbolize unity), hence the instrument is called a wooden fish for that reason.  In [[Buddhism]] the fish, which never sleeps, symbolizes wakefulness. Therefore, it is to remind the chanting monks to concentrate on their [[sutra]]. Often the mallet used to strike the fish has a rubber coated tip to provide a muffled, but clear sound when struck. A simplified form is given in the [[Temple block (instrument)|temple block]].

Wooden fish come in many sizes and shapes, ranging from {{Convert|150|mm|in}}, for laity use or sole daily practice, or to {{Convert|1.2|m|ft}} for usage in temples. Wooden fish are often (in Chinese temples) placed on the left of the altar, alongside a [[Rin gong|bell bowl]], its metal percussion counterpart. Wooden fish often rest on a small embroidered cushion to prevent damage and unpleasant knocking sounds caused from the fish lying on the surface of a hard table or ground, as well as to avoid damage to the instrument.

The Korean version of a wooden fish is simpler in shape and no design is carved onto the fish. It is more oblong in shape. It has a handle for easy carrying during portable uses. The Korean versions of a wooden fish are different in the sense that they provide a deeper, more wooden-like hollow sound when struck.

=== Original ===
[[File:Shofukuji Nagasaki January 2012 04.jpg|thumb|Original type]]
The original type of wooden fish is literally in the shape of a fish. Along with a large temple bell and drum, It is found suspended in front of Buddhist monasteries. When proceeding with various duties (such as eating, lectures, or chores), a monk and a supervisor utilize the instrument to call all monastics to go to their tasks. Historically, this was the first wooden fish developed, which gradually evolved into the round wooden fish used by Buddhists today. One of the most noted examples is at the temple of [[Manpuku-ji]].{{cn|date=April 2013}}

==Legends &amp; nomenclature ==
[[File:Nieuhof-Description-générale-de-la-Chine-1665 0852.tif|thumb|A [[mendicant]] with a "wooden fish" (sitting in the middle, with a big hat), drawn by [[Johan Nieuhof]] (Description générale de la Chine 1665) between 1655-1658]]
Many legends describe the origin of the wooden fish, which take place in [[China]]. One legend says that a monk went to India to acquire [[Sūtra|sutras]]. On his way to India, he found the way blocked by a wide, flooding river. There appeared neither bridge nor boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wooden Fish Legend|url=http://chineseculture.us/buddhism/wooden-fish.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suddenly, a big fish swam up. It offered to carry the monk across the river. The fish told the monk that it wanted to atone for a crime committed when it was a human. The fish made a simple request, that on the monk's way to obtain sutras, to ask the  [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] to guide the fish on a method to attain [[Bodhisattva]]hood.

The monk agreed to the fish's request and continued his quest for seventeen years. After getting the scriptures, he returned to China via the river, which was flooding again. As the monk worried about how to cross, the fish came back to help. It asked if the monk had made the request to the Buddha. To the monk's dismay, he had forgotten. The fish became furious and splashed the monk, washing him into the river. A passing [[fisherman]] saved him from drowning, but unfortunately the sutras had been ruined by the water.

The monk went home full of anger. Filled with anger at the fish, he made a wooden effigy of a fish head. When he recalled his adversity, he beat the fish head with a wooden hammer. To his surprise, each time he beat the wooden fish, the fish opened its mouth and vomited a [[Chinese characters|character]]. He became so happy that, when he had time, he always beat the fish. A few years later, he had got back from the wooden fish's mouth what he had lost to the flood.
