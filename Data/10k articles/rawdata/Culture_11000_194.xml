'''''Aftermath''''' is a 1994 Spanish [[Horror film|horror]] [[short film]] written and directed by [[Nacho Cerdà]]. Containing no spoken dialogue, ''Aftermath'' is the second installment in a trilogy of shorts by Cerdà, preceded by 1990's ''The Awakening'', and followed by 1998's ''Genesis''.

== Plot ==

A woman named Marta Arnau Marti dies in a car crash, after accidentally running over a dog. An orderly wheels Marta's body into a morgue drawer, past a mourning couple, who a nurse gives a crucifix necklace. The orderly overhears two workers [[autopsy]]ing a pair of male bodies, looks in on them out of curiosity, and leaves when one of the morticians (who is disturbingly enthused by his duties) glares at him. The morticians complete their work on the dead men, and while one leaves, the other remains, and brings in Marta's body.

Aroused by Marta, the mortician locks himself in the morgue with her body, undresses it, removes the brain, and caresses it with a knife, which he uses to mutilate Marta's vagina, and cut open her torso. The mortician masturbates to orgasm while fondling Marta's breasts and innards, then takes photographs of his handiwork. Unable to contain his lust any longer, the mortician engages in [[necrophilia]], after setting his camera on automatic to record the event.

Afterward, the mortician autopsies Marta, cleans up, and leaves. In his home, the pajama-clad mortician blends Marta's stolen heart into a pulp, which he gives to his dog before proceeding to relax in his sitting room. As a baby's cries emanate from the television, the scraps of newspaper the dog is eating the heart off of are shown to contain Marta's obituary.

== Cast ==

* Pep Tosar as Forense
* Jordi Tarrida as Médico #2
* Ángel Tarris as Celador
* Xevi Collellmir as Cadáver Vin

== Reception ==

[[Dread Central]] wrote, "It is intense. It is unflinching. Yet, at its core it is subtle, hauntingly beautiful, and every bit as rich in detail and composition as any other great film has ever been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/aftermathgenesis-dvd#axzz2mn0d29Kz|title = ''Aftermath/Genesis'' (DVD)|last = Bostaph|first = D. W.|work = [[Dread Central]]|date = 24 August 2005|accessdate = 7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVD Talk]] awarded four and a half out of five stars and wrote, "The necrophilia in this movie is very disturbing. It is not just carnal; it is filled with volatility and extreme violence. While nothing is shown outright, the implication is repellent enough. Indeed, one could argue that Cerdà is making a larger point about defying death. But it's a hard sell. Treating the departed as nothing more than a plaything for the fulfillment of one's most twisted desires almost erases any grander theme. While the ending is quite unnerving, the rest of ''Aftermath'' is an equally uneasy ordeal. You may see nothing more in it than [[fetishism]] gone foul, however. Or you may see something very insightful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/17184/aftermath-genesis/|title = ''Aftermath/Genesis''|last = Gibron|first = Bill|work = [[DVD Talk]]|date = 23 August 2005|accessdate = 7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it four and half out of five stars and wrote, "Aftermath, is definitely one of the most controversial films of the last couple of decades. Its ruthless and realistic depiction of grisly autopsies and a sinister surgeon with an inclination towards violent necrophilia has some of the hardest scenes to stomach in any horror movie, period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/109542/aftermathgenesis-v-2/|title=Aftermath/Genesis (V)|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===

''Aftermath'' won in the category "Best Short Film" at the 1997 [[Fantasia Festival]].

[[Anarchism]] has long had an association with the [[arts]], particularly with visual art, music and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Drew Egbert, ''Social Radicalism and the Arts'' (New York: Alfred J. Knopf, 1970) p.714f&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be dated back to the start of anarchism as a named political concept, and the writings of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] on the French [[realism (arts)|realist]] painter [[Gustave Courbet]]. In an essay on Courbet of 1857 Proudhon had set out a principle for art, which he saw in the work of Courbet, that it should show the real lives of the working classes and the injustices working people face at the hands of the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Charles Taylor, ''Nineteenth-century Theories of Art'' (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1987) p.384f&lt;/ref&gt;

However, very quickly this was refuted by the French novelist [[Émile Zola]] who objected to Proudhon advocating freedom for all in the name of anarchism, but then placing stipulations on artists as to what they should depict in their works.&lt;ref name="Michael Paraskos 2015"&gt;Michael Paraskos, ''Four Essays on Art and Anarchism'' (Mitcham: Orage Press, 2015) p.26f&lt;/ref&gt; This opened up a division in thinking on anarchist art which is still apparent today, with some anarchist writers and artists advocating a view that art should be propagandistic and used to further the anarchist cause, and others that anarchism should free the artist from the requirements to serve a patron and master and be free to pursue their own interests and agendas. In recent years the first of these approaches has been argued by writers such as Patricia Leighten&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Leighten, ’Réveil anarchiste: Salon Painting, Political Satire, Modernist Art’, in Josh MacPhee and Erik Reuland (eds.), ''Realizing the Impossible: Art Against Authority'' (Oakland: AK Press, 2007) p.39&lt;/ref&gt; and the second by [[Michael Paraskos]].&lt;ref name="Michael Paraskos 2015"/&gt;

Significant writers on the relationship between art and anarchism include:

* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]
* [[Peter Kropotkin]]
* [[Herbert Read]]
* [[Alex Comfort]]
* [[George Woodcock]]
* [[David Goodway]]
* [[Allan Antliff]]
* [[Cindy Milstein]]

Despite this history of a close relationship between art and anarchism some anarchist writers, such as Peter Kropotkin and Herbert Read, have argued that in an anarchist society the role of the artist would disappear completely as all human activity would become, in itself, artistic. This is a view of art in society that sees creativity as intrinsic to all human activity, whereas the effect of bourgeois [[capitalism]] has been to strip human life of its creative aspects through industrial standardisation, the atomisation of production processes and the professionalisation of art through the education system.&lt;ref&gt;John Farquhar McLay, ''Anarchism and Art'' (Glasgow: Autonomy Press, 1982) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for some writers on art and anarchism artists would not disappear as they would continue to provide an anarchist society with a space in which to continue to imagine new ways of understanding and organising reality, as well as a space in which to face possible fears&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, ''Four Essays on Art and Anarchism'' (Mitcham: Orage Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[Noël Carroll|Noël Carroll's]] theory of the function of horror stories and films in current society, 'Art-horror is the price we are willing to pay for the revelation of that which is impossible and unknown, of that which violates our conceptual schema.’&lt;ref&gt;Noel Carroll, ''The Philosophy of Horror or Paradoxes of the Heart'' (New York: Routledge, 1990) p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical notes ==

According to David Goodway:

{{cquote|There can be no doubt that one type of intellectual has been consistently drawn to anarchism, placing a premium on absolute freedom and non-interference in their personal and social lives, and belonging, like (Herbert) Read himself, to the artistic and literary avant-gardes. Significant clusters of anarchist painters and writers existed in pre-1914 Italy, New York before and during the First World War and, most impressive of all, the France of the 1880s and 1890s, where the Neo-Impressionists – Camille and Lucien Pissarro, Paul Signac, most probably the enigmatic Georges Seurat – and the Symbolist writers, including one of the greatest poets, Stéphane Mallarmé, all consisted of militant anarchists or sympathizers. In Bohemia the fact that Jaroslav Hašek had been a member of anarchist groups and worked on anarchist journals helps to explain the subversive genius of The Adventures of the Good Soldier Švejk; and Franz Kafka had attended anarchist meetings in Prague, gaining considerable familiarity with anarchist writers and personalities, and actually mentioning Bakunin and Kropotkin in his diary.  The German actor, Ret Marut, fleeing from Munich in 1919, recreated himself in Mexico as the still insufficiently appreciated novelist, B. Traven.&lt;ref&gt;David Goodway (2006) ''[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow: Left-Libertarian Thought and British Writers from William Morris to Colin Ward]]''.  Liverpool University Press. 2006 Pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anarchism had a significant influence on [[Symbolism (arts)|French Symbolism]] of the late 19th century, such as that of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], who was quoted as saying "''Je ne sais pas d'autre bombe, qu'un livre.''" (I know of no bomb other than a book.) Its ideas infiltrated the cafes and cabarets of turn-of-the-century Paris (see the Drunken Boat #2).

[[Oscar Wilde]]’s 1891 essay "[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]" has been seen as advocating anarchism. Oscar Wilde "stated in an interview that he believed he was ‘something of an Anarchist’, but previously said, ‘In the past I was a poet and a tyrant. Now I am an anarchist and artist.’"&lt;ref&gt;David Goodway (2006) ''[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow: Left-Libertarian Thought and British Writers from William Morris to Colin Ward]]''.  Liverpool University Press. 2006 Pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Many American artists of the early 20th century came under the influence of anarchist ideas, while others embraced anarchism as an ideology. The [[Ashcan School]] of American realism included anarchist artists, as well as artists such as [[Rockwell Kent]] (1882–1971) and [[George Bellows]] (1882-1925) who were influenced by anarchist ideas. [[Abstract expressionism]] also included anarchist artists such as [[Mark Rothko]] and painters such as [[Jackson Pollock]], who had adopted radical ideas during his experience as a muralist for the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Pollock's father had also been a [[Industrial Workers of the World|Wobbly]].

David Weir has argued in ''Anarchy and Culture'' that anarchism only had some success in the sphere of cultural avant-gardism because of its failure as a political movement; cognizant of anarchism's claims to overcome the barrier between art and political activism, he nevertheless suggests that this is not achieved in reality. Weir suggests that for the "ideologue" it might be possible to adapt "[[aesthetics]] to [[politics]]", but that "from the perspective of the poet" a solution might be to "adapt the politics to the aesthetics". He identifies this latter strategy with anarchism, on account of its [[individualism]]. Weir has also suggested that "the contemporary critical strategy of aestheticizing politics" among [[Marxism|Marxists]] such as [[Fredric Jameson]] results from the demise of Marxism as a [[State (polity)|state]] ideology. "The situation whereby ideology attempts to operate outside of politics has already pointed Marxism toward postmodernist culture, just as anarchism moved into the culture of modernism when it ceased to have political validity".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 20th century examples of anarchism and the arts include the [[collage]] works by [[James Koehnline]], [[Johan Humyn Being]], and others whose work was being published in anarchist magazines such as ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'' and [[Fifth Estate (periodical)|''Fifth Estate'']]. [[The Living Theatre]], a theatrical troupe headed by [[Judith Malina]] and [[Julian Beck]], were outspoken about their anarchism, often incorporating anarchistic themes into their performances.

In the 1990s, anarchists became involved in the [[mail art]] movement &amp;ndash; "art which uses the postal service in some way". This relates to the involvement of many anarchists in the [[zine]] movement. Some contemporary anarchists make art in the form of [[flyposter]]s, stencils, and radical puppets.

==Visual art==

===Nineteenth century realism===
Visual art was considered one of the most important aspects of anarchist activity from the birth of anarchism, with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] writing on his friend and contemporary [[Gustav Courbet]] in the essay "Du Principe de l'art", published 1865, that 'The task of art is to warn us, to praise us, to teach us, to make us blush by confronting us with the mirror of our own conscience.' Courbet also went on to paint Proudhon on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bowness, 'Courbet's Proudhon' in The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 120, No. 900, 1978, p.123f&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Courbet wrote in 1850:

{{quote|In our so very civilized society it is necessary for me to live the life of a savage. I must be free even of governments. The people have my sympathies, I must address myself to them directly.&lt;ref name=artchive&gt;Courbet, Gustave: [http://www.artchive.com/artchive/C/courbet.html artchive.com] citing Perl, Jed: ''Gallery Going: Four Seasons in the Art World'', 1991, Harcourt, {{ISBN|978-0-15-134260-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism===
Among the [[Impressionists]] the artist [[Camille Pissarro]] is known to have had strong anarchist sympathies which led him to recommend to his children that they change their surnames to avoid being associated with his political beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Erickson, 'The Art of Orovida: Looking beyond the Pissarro Family Legacy', in ''Woman's Art Journal,'' Vol. 15, No. 2 (Autumn, 1994 - Winter, 1995), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Pissarro's anarchism brought him into contact with the younger artists who formed the [[Neo-Impressionist]] group, particularly [[Paul Signac]], [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Charles Angrand]], [[Theo van Rysselberghe]] and Maximillien Luce, who were active in anarchist circles, particularly those of the political activist [[Jean Grave]], who encouraged other anarchist activists to embrace the potential of art to further their cause. In their collaborations they established a tripartite relationship between art and anarchism, still debated to this day,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Michael Paraskos]], ''Four Essays on Art and Anarchism'' (London: Orage Press, 2015) p.27f)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the artist could be employed for direct propagandistic purposes, or could show images of the true condition of the proletariat, or, more controversially, envision future realities towards which an anarchist revolution might aspire.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert L. Herbert and Eugenia W. Herbert, 'Artists and Anarchism: Unpublished Letters of Pissarro, Signac and Others' in ''The Burlington Magazine,'' Vol. 102, No. 692 (Nov., 1960), p.472f&lt;/ref&gt; It is in this latter context that the bucolic images of the south of France by artists such as Cross and Signac should be viewed as anarchist paintings.&lt;ref&gt;See Anne Dymond, 'A Politicized Pastoral: Signac and the Cultural Geography of Mediterranean France' in ''The Art Bulletin,'' vol. 85, No. 2 (Jun., 2003), p.353f&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubism and Futurism===
Patricia Leighten has shown that Spanish [[cubist]] painter [[Juan Gris]] was an artist with strong anarchist sympathies, although she argues this is only evident in his overtly political cartoons. She suggests his cubist still lives, deliberately eschewed anarchist subject matter so that he 'self-consciously drained his paintings of political import, avoiding such anarchist subjects as prostitutes and neutralised his radical style'.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Leighten, 'Réveil anarchiste: Salon Painting, Political Satire, Modernist Art', in Josh MacPhee and Erik Reuland (eds.), Realizing the Impossible: Art Against Authority (Oakland: AK Press, 2007) p.39&lt;/ref&gt; However, drawing on the principle established by Neo-Impressionist artists such as Cross and Signac, that anarchist art can also involve visualising alternative realities for an anarchist society, [[Michael Paraskos]] has criticised this reading of Gris's paintings, saying that this form of anarchism seems to demand that 'artists conform to a pre- determined template to define their work as radical. Cartoons of prostitutes are anarchist; paintings of bottles, playing cards and fruit are not.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Paraskos]], ''Four Essays on Art and Anarchism'' (London: Orage Press, 2015) p.28)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though typically not associated with [[futurism]], anarchism had some minor influence on [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]. Carlo Carrà's best known work was ''[[The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli]]'', painted in 1911. In the 1912 catalogue for the Futurists' first Parisian exhibition [[Umberto Boccioni]] remarked ''"the sheaves of lines corresponding to all the conflicting forces, following the general law of violence"'' which he labeled ''force lines'' encapsulating the Futurist idea of [[physical transcendentalism]]. [[Mark Antliff]] has suggested that this futurist aesthetic was "designed to involve the spectator in the very politics that led to Italy's intervention in World War I and, ultimately, to the rise of [[Fascism]] in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_4_82/ai_69411772/pg_8 The Fourth Dimension and Futurism: A Politicized Space | Art Bulletin, The | Find Articles at BNET.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian [[Giovanni Lista]] has identified this aesthetic as first appearing in the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] current, where [[Marinetti]] encountered the Sorelian "myths of action and violence".

The [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher and poet [[Renzo Novatore]] belonged to the leftist section of futurism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novatore.it/Una_biografia.html Novatore: una biografia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722043805/http://www.novatore.it/Una_biografia.html |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other individualist anarcho-futurists such as [[Dante Carnesecchi]], [[Leda Rafanelli]], [[Auro d'Arcola]], and Giovanni Governato.

===Surrealism===
{{Quote box

|source=[[André Breton]]
}}

[[Surrealism]] was both an artistic and political movement aims at the liberation of the human being from the constraints of [[capitalism]], the state, and the cultural forces that limit the reign of the imagination. From its origins individualist anarchists like [[Florent Fels]] opposed it with his magazine ''Action: Cahiers individualistes de philosophie et d'art''. However faced with the popularity of surrealism Fels' magazine closed in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DadaComp|title=DADA &amp; Modernist Magazines|url=http://www.dada-companion.com/journals/per_action.php|website=DADA Companion|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement developed in [[France]] in the wake of [[World War I]] with [[André Breton]] (1896&amp;ndash;1966) as its main theorist and poet. Originally it was tied closely to the [[Communist Party]]. Later, Breton, a close friend of [[Leon Trotsky]], broke with the Communist Party and embraced anarchism, even writing in the publication of the French [[Anarchist Federation (France)|Anarchist Federation]].

By the end of [[World War II]] the surrealist group led by Breton had decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote "It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself."&lt;ref name="anarchosurrealism"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919-1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Breton was consistent in his support for the [[Fédération Anarchiste|francophone Anarchist Federation]] and he continued to offer his solidarity after the [[Platformism|Platformist]]s around [[Fontenis]] transformed the FA into the Federation Communiste Libertaire. He was one of the few intellectuals who continued to offer his support to the FCL during the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962) when the FCL suffered severe repression and was forced underground. He sheltered Fontenis whilst he was in hiding. He refused to take sides on the splits in the French anarchist movement and both he and Peret expressed solidarity as well with the new FA set up by the synthesist anarchists, and worked in the Antifascist Committees of the 1960s alongside the FA."&lt;ref&gt;name="anarchosurrealism"/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Funeraloftheanarchistgalli.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli]] by [[Carlo Carrà]], 1911.]]

===Post-Second World War modernism===
In the period after [[World War II]] the relationship between art and anarchism was articulated by a number of theorists including [[Alex Comfort]], [[Herbert Read]] and [[George Woodcock]]. Although each wrote from perspectives supportive of [[modernist art]] they refused to accept the position put forward by [[Clement Greenberg]] that modernist art had no political, social or narrative meaning, a view that would have curtailed an anarchist reading of modern art. In his study on the relationship between modern art and radical politics, Social Radicalism and the Arts, [[Donald Drew Egbert]] argued that in fact modern artists were often most at home with an anarchist understanding of the position of the place of the artist in society than either a de-politicised Greenbergian or a [[Marxist]] understanding of the role of art.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Drew Egbert, ''Social Radicalism and the Arts'' (New York: Alfred J. Knopf, 1970) p.714f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary art===
In contemporary art anarchism can take diverse forms, from [[carnivalesque]] street art, to [[graffiti art]] and [[graphic novel]]s, to various traditional forms of art, including painting, sculpture, video and photography.&lt;ref&gt;See Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004) p.221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
A number of performers and artists have either been inspired by anarchist concepts, or have used the medium of music and sound in order to promote [[anarchist]] ideas and politics. French singers-songwriters [[Léo Ferré]] and [[Georges Brassens]] are maybe the first to do so, in the fifties and beyond.

[[Punk rock]] is one movement that has taken much inspiration from the often potent imagery and symbolism associated with anarchism and [[Situationist International|Situationist]] rhetoric, if not always the political theory. In the past few decades, anarchism has been closely associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Indeed, many anarchists were introduced to the ideas of Anarchism through that symbolism and the anti-authoritarian sentiment which many punk songs expressed.

[[Anarcho-punk]], on the other hand, is a current that has been more explicitly engaged with anarchist politics, particularly in the case of bands such as [[Crass]], [[Poison Girls]], (early) [[Chumbawamba]], [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]], [[Flux of Pink Indians]], [[Rudimentary Peni]], [[The Apostles (band)|The Apostles]], [[Riot/Clone]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Oi Polloi]], [[Sin Dios]], [[Propagandhi]], [[Citizen Fish]], [[Bus Station Loonies]] etc. Many other bands, especially at the local level of unsigned groups, have taken on what is known as a "punk" or "[[DIY punk ethic|DIY]]" ethic: that is, Doing It Yourself, indeed a popular Anarcho-punk slogan reads "DIY not [[EMI]]", a reference to a conscious rejection of the major record company. Some groups who began as 'anarcho-punk' have attempted to move their ideas into a more mainstream musical arena, for instance, Chumbawamba, who continue to support and promote anarchist politics despite now playing more dance music and pop influenced styles.

[[Techno music]] is also connected strongly to anarchists and eco-anarchists, as many of the events playing these types of music are self-organised and put on in contravention of national laws. Sometimes doors are pulled off empty warehouses and the insides transformed into illegal clubs with cheap (or free) entrance, types of music not heard elsewhere and quite often an abundance of different drugs. Other raves may be held outside, and are viewed negatively by the authorities. In the UK, the Criminal Justice Bill (1994) outlawed these events ([[rave party|raves]]) and brought together a coalition of [[socialists]], ravers and [[direct action]]ists who opposed the introduction of this 'draconian' Act of Parliament by having a huge 'party&amp;protest' in the Centre of London that descended into one of the largest riots of the 1990s in Britain. [[Digital hardcore]], an [[electronic music]] genre, is also overtly anarchist; [[Atari Teenage Riot]] is the most widely recognized digital hardcore band. It should be noted that both Digital Hardcore, Techno and related genres are not the sole preserve of anarchists; people of many musical, political or recreational persuasions are involved in these musical scenes.

[[Heavy metal music|Heavy Metal]] bands such as Sweden's [[Arch Enemy]] and Germany's [[Kreator]] have also embraced anarchistic themes in their lyrics and imagery.

The genre of [[folk punk]] or "radical folk" has become increasingly prevalent in protest culture, with artists like [[David Rovics]] openly asserting anarchist beliefs.

[[Negativland]]'s ''[[The ABCs of Anarchism]]'' includes a reading of material from [[Alexander Berkman]]'s ''[[Now and After]]'' and other anarchist-related material in a sound collage.

Paul Gailiunas and his late wife [[Helen Hill]] co-wrote the anarchist song "[[Emma Goldman]]", which was performed by the band Piggy: The Calypso Orchestra of the Maritimes and released on their 1999 album ''Don't Stop the Calypso: Songs of Love and Liberation''.&lt;ref name=divergences&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divergences.be/spip.php?article425&amp;lang=fr|title=Remembering Helen Hill: A New Orleans community comes together after the murder of a friend and activist|author=John Clark|date=14 May 2007|publisher=Divergences}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Helen and Paul moved to [[New Orleans]], Paul started a new band called The Troublemakers and re-released the song "Emma Goldman" on their 2004 album ''Here Come The Troublemakers''.&lt;ref name=divergences /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEzSPDFYIN8&amp;feature=plcp|title=Emma Goldman|author=The Troublemakers|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proclaiming the motto "It's your duty as a citizen to troublemake," other songs on the album include "International Flag Burning Day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianamusicfactory.com/showoneprod.asp?productid=4022 |title=Here Come The Troublemakers |author=Louisiana Music Factory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211051233/http://www.louisianamusicfactory.com/showoneprod.asp?ProductID=4022 |archivedate=2007-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o370GwwB0kU|title=International Flag Burning Day|author=The Troublemakers|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Azerbaijanis}}
'''Azerbaijani art''' has developed over the ancient [[history of Azerbaijan]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]. The [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] have created a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is [[Decorative arts|decorative]] and [[applied art]]. This form of art rooted in hoary antiquity, is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jewelery-making, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lacing&lt;!--lace-making?--&gt;, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of [[Visual arts of Azerbaijan|decorative art]], evidence of the culture and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very popular there. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.

==Prehistoric art==
[[File:Petroglyphs in Gobustan 01.jpg|250px|thumb|Rock paintings in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]]]]
Images reflecting magic, [[totem]]ic notions of ancient people, their religious customs and hunting scenes saved on rocks in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]] evidence about primitive art in the [[Paleolithic]] epoch. Men and women, fishing scenes, images of people dancing on the rocks, galloping horses hunters, lonely figure of a reaper with a sickle, round dances of people reminding of “[[yalli]]”, boats with rowers, solar signs and various wild animals had been portrayed there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1076 UNESCO World Heritage: Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gamigaya Petroglyphs]] in the territory of [[Ordubad Rayon]] are dated back to the 4th-1st centuries BC. About 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer, goats, bulls, dogs, snakes, birds, fantastic beings and also people, carriages and various symbols had been found out on basalt rocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irs-az.com/pdf/090621154956.pdf Наскальные рисунки Гямигая]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==

Varieties of painted ornamental and semantic motifs are typical for ceramic items found out in different oblasts of [[Azerbaijan]] such as [[Şahtaxtı|Shahtakhty]] and [[Makenis|Gizilvang]].

A large vessel found out in Shahtakhty village and black-glossed [[Wenshou|zoomorphic]] vessels found out in [[Mingachevir]] are the most famous patterns of ceramic items of Azerbaijan. A unique [[rhyton]] cup with a figure of deer with branchy antlers on it is the most interesting find. A figure of two-headed deer from burials of Dolanlar village, bronze figures of birds from Chovdar village, gold adorning and also rhyton with deer head from Mingachevir had been found out.

Foundations of columns had been found out in different rayons of Azerbaijan, mainly from [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] and [[Qabala Rayon|Gabala]]. And details of plant images had been painted on stone foundations found out in [[Gazakh Rayon]] and belonged to the 4th-3rd centuries BC. Cave dwellings of [[Zangilan Rayon|Zangilan]], [[Qonaqkənd, Quba|Gonagkend]] and [[Shamakhi Rayon|Shamakhi]] Rayons, rocky shelters of Gazakh Rayon, serf and [[Cyclopean masonry|Cyclopean constructions]] of uplands of [[Lesser Caucasus]] and Nakhchivan found out by archeologists are also very interesting.

Development of old and appearance of new cities favored development of caravan trade and expansion of handicraft production. Many cities famed for rug weaving, production of artistic ceramic jars, gold and silver items.

Patterns of engravings and sculptures were broadly spread in visual arts in the period of [[Caucasian Albania]]’s existence.&lt;ref name="artofazerbaijan" /&gt;

A stone cap of the 5th-6th centuries found out in Sudagilan settlement of Mingachevir Rayon were one of the most famous findings of that time. A cup found out in Bartim village and dated from the 2nd-4th centuries is kept in the [[State Historical Museum|Moscow Museum of History]].

[[File:Momine Fragment.jpg|left|thumb|Ornament on Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhchivan, the 12th century]]
Seizure of Caucasian Albania by Arabs in the 7th century was of great importance in further development of visual arts. [[Muslim]] – [[Culture of Iran|Iranian]] and [[Arab culture|Arabic]] cultures began to spread in the territory of modern Azerbaijan. Construction of mosques, mausoleums, castles and other cultic architectural monuments was followed by their decoration with various patterns and ornaments, calligraphic elements (epitaph), tile and bas-reliefs. Restriction of images of alive beings by [[Islam]] stimulated development of ornamental forms of decorative arts. Ornaments on [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]] in Nakhchivan, constructed in the epoch of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] [[Atabeg]]’ reign and khanegah on the shore of the [[Pirsaat River]] are interesting monuments of that time.

[[File:Divankhane ornament.jpg|150px|thumb|"Divankhana". A fragment of a decoration. Palace of the Shirvanshahs in Baku, the 15th century]]
Set of small states appeared in the territory of Azerbaijan after weakening of [[Caliphate|Arab Caliphate]]. Local art schools were opened in cities such as [[Barda Rayon|Barda]], [[Shamakhi Rayon|Shamakhi]], [[Beylagan Rayon|Beylagan]], [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] and [[Shabran (historical city)|Shabran]]. Architectural schools of [[Architectural school of Nakhchivan|Nakchivan]], [[Shirvan (city)|Shirvan]]-[[Absheron Rayon|Absheron]] and [[Tabriz]] are the most important among them. Monuments and constructions of “Nakhchivan school” are distinguished for their ceramic details, which initially were one-colored, but then became multi-colored. Ornamental motifs generally consisted of baked brick and tile. Smooth stone walls with plastics which were rarely used in architectural elements, belong to “Shirvan-Absheron architectural school”. Patterns of stone carving art, geometric and plant ornaments take an important place in buildings belonging to this architectural school.

Artistic value of “[[divankhana]]” from [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]] ensemble “are determined by perfection of the composition, tectonics of architectural forms, virtuosity of painting and creation of ornaments” according to L.Bretatsinki and B.Weymarn.

Stones with inscriptions and images of people and animals (tiger, camel, horse, bull and bird) had been found out in the Shirvanshahs’ architectural monument called [[Sabayil Castle]] constructed in the 13th century in [[Bay of Baku|Baku Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_pictures/52/%D0%90%D0%B7%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%B4%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F Художественная энциклопедия]&lt;/ref&gt; There had been made in deep carving style and had characteristics of frieze. This monument is a pattern of sculptural art where inscriptions and salient images was a decisive factor in decorative design of buildings. Cultural traditions of ancient Caucasian Albania are saved in reliefs of the stones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/Iskuss2/7.htm Академия художеств СССР.

Bayil stones which had characteristics of friezes, consisted of decorative elements in grand architectural land monuments located on land, at that time.

Ceramic items found out during archeological excavations in Shabran and Baylagan also give evidence of the high-level development of visual arts in the [[Middle Ages]].

===Azerbaijani rugs===
{{main|Azerbaijani carpet weaving|Azerbaijani rug|Quba rugs and carpets|Ganja rugs|Karabakh carpet}}
Azerbaijani rugs are a product of [[Azerbaijan]], an ancient center of carpet weaving. 
Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Development of carpet weaving boosted after [[Ismail I]]'s takeover of [[Safavid dynasty]].

Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. The true scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of [[Latif Karimov]], a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, i.e. Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art - KMT |url=http://www.kmt.az/culture/art.html |website=www.kmt.az |accessdate=6 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213642/http://www.kmt.az/culture/art.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Karabakh carpet]] is one of five major regional groups of carpets made in [[Azerbaijan]] named after the [[Karabakh]] region, which comprises present [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and adjacent lowland territories ('lowland Karabakh'). The Karabakh carpets amount to 33 compositions. Due to the specifics of the local sheep wool the Karabakh carpets are characterized by thick pile, high and fluffy. These carpets are marked for their vivid and joyous colors. They are divided into four groups: without medallions, with medallions, namazlyk and subject carpet. In the mountainous part of Karabakh the carpets were made in Malybeili, Muradkhanly, Dashbulakh, Jebrail, Goradis and many other villages.

In 2010, art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in Azerbaijan was added to the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].

===Tabriz school of miniature painting===
[[Persian miniature|Persian miniature painting]] was developing in the territory of Azerbaijan in the Middle Ages. Manuscripts with miniature paintings of people, animals and landscapes in them were popular at that time. Heores of poetic works by [[Ferdowsi]], [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]], [[Hafez]], [[Jami]], [[Navoiy]], [[Amir Khusrow|Amir Khusrow Dehlawi]] and others took an important place in creativity of Persian miniature artists.&lt;ref&gt;G.Fehervari. Art and architecture // Peter Malcolm Holt, Ann K. S. Lambton, Bernard Lewis. The Cambridge history of Islam, vol. 2. Cambridge University Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-521-29138-0}}, 9780521291385. Стр. 738 ''"In miniature painting, Herat remained the centre only for a few years after Shah Ismail's occupation of the city. Artists, like Bihzad and many of his pupils, moved to the new capital, Tabriz. Thus Tabriz became once more a centre of '''Persian painting'''. Another new centre emerged in Bukhara, which was very active during the tenth/sixteenth and early eleventh/seventeenth centuries. Illumination of manuscripts of the Shah-namа and Khamsa of Nizami continued. Bihzad's style was followed for quite a long time. Upon the moving of the capital to Isfahan under Shah 'Abbas I, a new school of painters was founded there which excelled not only in miniature painting, but also in the production of bookbindings and in lacquer-works as well."''&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 15th century, a new style –“[[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] style” – of miniature spread in the territories of [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu]] states was developed.&lt;ref name="artofazerbaijan" &gt;[http://www.elibrary.az/docs/artofazerb.pdf Л. С. Бретаницкий, Б. В. Веймарн. Очерки истории и теории изобразительных искусств. Искусство Азербайджана]&lt;/ref&gt; Such miniatures of this style were made in Tabriz and other cities located in the territory of modern Azerbaijan. Shamakhi – the capital of the Shirvanshahs’ Government was one of them. Traces of this now ancient style created by artists worked in workshops of [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashidaddin]] in the beginning of the 14th century can be observed in miniatures created by Abdul-Bagi Bakuvi, [[Baku]] artist of the 15th century. Illustrations for “Anthology of the Eastern poetry” or “Anthology of Shamakhi” of 1468 and saved in [[British Museum]] in [[London]] are the best miniatures created by artist of Shamakhi and Baku. One-figured and two-figured portraits painted by Abdulbagi Bakuvi (“Stableman” and “Two amirs”) and saved in [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapi Museum]], in [[Istanbul]] belong to miniature art of Baku. Influence of Far Eastern painting can be felt in creativity of many miniature artists of that time.

Wars between [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]] and also feudal wrangles among [[Khanates of the Caucasus|khanates]] adversely affected development of visual arts in 17th-18th centuries. But colorful masterpieces of visual arts had been continuing created and the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]] built by architect Khadali Zeynalabdin from [[Shiraz]] in 1797, is one of these masterpieces. These decorative paintings created by masters such as Abbasgulu, [[Usta Gambar Garabaghi]], Aligulu, Gurban Ali, Shukur and others were created with bright and motley colors. Images of people and animals, and also battle and hunting scenes were painted on the waslls of the palace.

Monumental constrictions, generally was suffering a decline. In the XVIII, wall paintings which mainly consisted of compositions of plant motifs appeared in houses of wealthy townsmen.&lt;ref name="enciclopediya"&gt;{{cite web

New progressive visual arts of Azerbaijan faced a delay in development in the 19th century. Development of realistic easel painting was extremely low.&lt;ref name="irevani" /&gt;

'''Butterflies''' are [[insect]]s in the [[macrolepidoptera]]n [[clade]] Rhopalocera from the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Lepidoptera]], which also includes [[moth]]s. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large [[superfamily (zoology)|superfamily]] [[Papilionoidea]], which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea") and the most recent analyses suggest it also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea"). Butterfly fossils date to the [[Paleocene]], which was about 56 million years ago.

Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their [[larva]]e, known as [[caterpillar]]s, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, [[pupa]]te in a [[chrysalis]]. When [[metamorphosis]] is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.

Butterflies are often [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]], and many species make use of [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]] and [[aposematism]] to evade their predators. Some, like the [[Monarch (butterfly)|monarch]] and the [[Vanessa cardui|painted lady]], [[Insect migration|migrate]] over long distances. Many butterflies are attacked by [[parasite]]s or [[parasitoid]]s, including [[parasitoid wasp|wasps]], [[protozoa]]ns, [[Fly|flies]], and other invertebrates, or are [[Predation|preyed upon]] by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of [[pollination]] of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., [[Miletinae|harvesters]]) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of [[ant]]s, while others live as [[mutualism (biology)|mutualists]] in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.

==Etymology==
[[File:Common brimstone butterfly (Gonepteryx rhamni) male in flight.jpg|thumb|The original "butter-fly"?&lt;ref name=BugsBritannica/&gt; A male brimstone (''[[Gonepteryx rhamni]]'') in flight]]

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' derives the word straightforwardly from [[Old English]] ''butorflēoge'', butter-fly; similar names in [[Old Dutch]] and [[Old High German]] show that the name is ancient. A possible source of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimstone (''[[Gonepteryx rhamni]]''); another is that butterflies were on the wing in meadows during the spring and summer butter season while the grass was growing.&lt;ref name=BugsBritannica&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marren |first1=Peter |last2=Mabey |first2=Richard |title=Bugs Britannica |date=2010 |publisher=Chatto and Windus |isbn=978-0-7011-8180-2 |pages=196–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald A.

The oldest butterflies are from the [[Palaeocene]] [[MoClay]] or [[Fur Formation]] of Denmark, approximately 55  million years old.

Traditionally, the butterflies have been divided into the [[Superfamily (zoology)|superfamily]] [[Papilionoidea]] excluding the smaller groups of the [[Hesperiidae]] (skippers) and the more moth-like [[Hedylidae]] of America. [[phylogeny|Phylogenetic]] analysis suggests that the traditional Papilionoidea is [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with respect to the other two groups, so they should both be included within Papilionoidea, to form a single butterfly group, thereby synonymous with the clade '''Rhopalocera'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heikkilä | first1 = M. | last2 = Kaila | first2 = L. | last3 = Mutanen | first3 = M. | last4 = Peña | first4 = C. | last5 = Wahlberg | first5 = N. | year = 2012 | title = Cretaceous Origin and Repeated Tertiary Diversification of the Redefined Butterflies | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 279 | issue = 1731| pages = 1093–1099 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.1430 | pmid=21920981 | pmc=3267136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kawahara | first1 = A.

Butterfly adults are characterized by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name ([[Ancient Greek]] λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with [[melanin]]s that give them blacks and browns, as well as [[uric acid]] derivatives and [[flavones]] that give them yellows, but many of the blues, greens, reds and [[Iridescence|iridescent colours]] are created by [[structural coloration]] produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=C.

As in all insects, the body is divided into three sections: the head, [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]], and [[abdomen]]. The thorax is composed of three segments, each with a pair of legs. In most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of [[moth]]s which may be threadlike or feathery. The long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowers.&lt;ref name=Gullan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gullan, P. J. |author2=Cranston, P.

Nearly all butterflies are [[Diurnal cycle|diurnal]], have relatively bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above their bodies when at rest, unlike the majority of moths which fly by night, are often [[crypsis|cryptically]] coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over their bodies.

Butterfly [[larva]]e, [[caterpillar]]s, have a hard ([[Sclerotin|sclerotised]]) head with strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have cylindrical bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each.&lt;ref name=Gullan/&gt; Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The [[pupa]] or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.&lt;ref name=Gullan/&gt;

Many butterflies are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Most butterflies have the [[ZW sex-determination system|ZW]] [[sex-determination system]] where females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9292232 |date=August 1997 |last1=Traut |first1=W. |last2=Marec |first2=F. |title=Sex Chromosome Differentiation in Some Species of Lepidoptera (Insecta) |volume=5 |issue=5|pages=283–91 |issn=0967-3849 |doi=10.1023/B:CHRO.0000038758.08263.c3 |journal=Chromosome Research: An International Journal on the Molecular, Supramolecular and Evolutionary Aspects of Chromosome Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterflies in their adult stage can live from a week to nearly a year depending on the species.

The vast majority of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle; [[egg]], [[larva]] (caterpillar), [[pupa]] (chrysalis) and [[imago]] (adult). In the genera ''[[Colias]]'', ''[[Erebia]]'', ''[[Euchloe]]'', and ''Parnassius'', a small number of species are known that reproduce [[Parthenogenesis|semi-parthenogenetically]]; when the female dies, a partially developed larva emerges from her abdomen.&lt;ref name=Capinera640/&gt;

====Egg====

[[File:Butterfly laying eggs underneath a leaf.jpg|thumb|A butterfly laying eggs underneath the leaf]]

Butterfly eggs are protected by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the ''chorion''. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called ''micropyles''; the purpose of these holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.&lt;ref name=Capinera640&gt;{{cite book |author=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA640 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfly eggs are fixed to a leaf with a special glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, deforming the shape of the egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched but in the case of ''[[Pieris brassicae]]'', it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beament, J.W.L. |author2=Lal, R. |year=1957 |title=Penetration Through the Egg-shell of ''Pieris brassicae'' |journal=Bulletin of Entomological Research |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=109–125 |doi=10.1017/S0007485300054134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butterflies in the genus ''[[Agathymus]]'' do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.&lt;ref name=Scott121&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott, James A. |title=The Butterflies of North America: A Natural History and Field Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oa5m8gZcGjMC&amp;pg=PA121 |year=1992 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-2013-7 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eggs are almost invariably laid on plants. Each species of butterfly has its own host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA676 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |page=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, such as the [[great spangled fritillary]], the eggs are deposited close to but not on the food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do [[Viola (plant)|violets]] in this example.&lt;ref name=Shepard55&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shepard, Jon |author2=Guppy, Crispin |title=Butterflies of British Columbia: Including Western Alberta, Southern Yukon, the Alaska Panhandle, Washington, Northern Oregon, Northern Idaho, and Northwestern Montana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=il6rJ7glHNQC&amp;pg=PA55 |year=2011 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn=978-0-7748-4437-6 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The egg stage lasts a few weeks in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, especially in temperate regions, go through a [[diapause]] (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British Butterflies: Education: Butterflies in Winter |url=http://www.britishbutterflies.co.uk/winter.asp |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some temperate region butterflies, such as the [[Nymphalis antiopa|Camberwell beauty]], lay their eggs in the spring and have them hatch in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Camberwell Beauty |url=http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/en/perhoset/camberwell-beauty |publisher=NatureGate |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caterpillar larva====

Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant leaves and spend practically all of their time searching for and eating food.

[[File:Four-horned Sphinx (Elm Sphinx).jpg|thumb|[[Camouflage|Cryptic]] [[countershading|countershaded]] caterpillar of a hawkmoth, ''[[Ceratomia amyntor]]'']]

Caterpillars mature through a series of developmental stages known as [[instar]]s. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called [[apolysis]], mediated by the release of a series of [[neurohormone]]s. During this phase, the [[cuticle]], a tough outer layer made of a mixture of [[chitin]] and specialized [[protein]]s, is released from the softer [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]] beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva [[ecdysis|moults]], the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment.&lt;ref name=Klowden&gt;{{cite book |author=Klowden, Marc J. |title=Physiological Systems in Insects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CABp1YL0F8gC&amp;pg=PA114 |year=2013 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-415970-9 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.

Caterpillars have short antennae and several [[Simple eye in invertebrates|simple eyes]]. The [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles and a pair maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt; Caterpillars such as those in the genus ''[[Calpodes]]'' (family Hesperiidae) have a specialized tracheal system on the 8th segment that function as a primitive lung.&lt;ref name="Locke 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Locke | first=Michael | title=Caterpillars have evolved lungs for hemocyte gas exchange | journal=Journal of Insect Physiology | volume=44 | issue=1 | year=1997 | doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(97)00088-7 | pmid=12770439 | pages=1–20 |url=https://www.academia.edu/33633960/Caterpillars_have_evolved_lungs_for_hemocyte_gas_exchange&lt;!--full text, unlike DOI--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of [[proleg]]s arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naturemuseum.org/online/thebutterflylab/anatomy/larva.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319072020/http://www.naturemuseum.org/online/thebutterflylab/anatomy/larva.html |archivedate=19 March 2012 | title=Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum | publisher=Chicago Academy of Sciences | work=Larva Legs | accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epidermis bears tufts of [[seta]]e, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration in the form of hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the [[gonad]]s start development in the egg stage.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt;

====Pupa====
[[File:Chrysalis5504.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chrysalis]] of [[gulf fritillary]]]]

When the larva is fully grown, hormones such as [[prothoracicotropic hormone]] (PTTH) are produced. At this point the larva stops feeding, and begins "wandering" in the quest for a suitable pupation site, often the underside of a leaf or other concealed location. There it spins a button of silk which it uses to fasten its body to the surface and moults for a final time. While some caterpillars spin a [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]] to protect the pupa, most species do not. The naked pupa, often known as a chrysalis, usually hangs head down from the cremaster, a spiny pad at the posterior end, but in some species a silken girdle may be spun to keep the pupa in a head-up position.&lt;ref name=Capinera640/&gt; Most of the tissues and cells of the larva are broken down inside the pupa, as the constituent material is rebuilt into the imago. The structure of the transforming insect is visible from the exterior, with the wings folded flat on the ventral surface and the two halves of the proboscis, with the antennae and the legs between them.&lt;ref name=Formfunction&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/animal/lepidopteran/Form-and-function |title=Lepidopteran: Form and function |author=Culin, Joseph |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pupal transformation into a butterfly through [[metamorphosis]] has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings visible on the outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.&lt;ref name="pmid11676917"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brunetti, Craig R. |author2=Selegue, Jayne E. |author3=Monteiro, Antonia |author4=French, Vernon |author5=Brakefield, Paul M. |author6=Carroll, Sean B. |year=2001 |title=The Generation and Diversification of Butterfly Eyespot Color Patterns |journal=Current Biology |volume=11 |issue=20 |pages=1578–1585 |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00502-4 |pmid=11676917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adult====
The reproductive stage of the insect is the winged adult or [[imago]]. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, each of which is an outgrowth from a single [[Epidermis|epidermal]] cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large [[Eye#Compound eyes|compound eyes]]. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are adapted to sucking and the [[mandible]]s are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular [[proboscis]] which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt;

The thorax of the butterfly is devoted to locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among [[Nymphalidae|nymphalids]], the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs). The second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings. The leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together ([[Wing coupling (Lepidoptera anatomy)|as they are in moths]]) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair of [[spiracle]]s which are used in respiration.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt;

The abdomen consists of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has a pair of clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A [[spermatophore]] is deposited in the female, following which the sperm make their way to a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species.&lt;ref name=Formfunction/&gt; After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with [[hemolymph]] and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Woodbury, Elton N. |title=Butterflies of Delmarva |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDNHAAAAYAAJ |year=1994 |publisher=Delaware Nature Society; Tidewater Publishers |isbn=978-0-87033-453-5 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behaviour===
[[File:Australian painted lady feeding.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Australian painted lady]] feeding on a flowering shrub]]

Butterflies feed primarily on [[nectar]] from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from [[pollen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilbert |first=L. E. |year=1972 |title=Pollen Feeding and Reproductive Biology of ''Heliconius'' Butterflies |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=1402–1407 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/69/6/1403.abstract |doi=10.1073/pnas.69.6.1403|pmid=16591992 |pmc=426712 }}&lt;/ref&gt; tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, they do not carry as much pollen load as [[bee]]s, but they are capable of moving pollen over greater distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrera |first=C.

Adult butterflies consume only liquids, ingested through the proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, from which they obtain sugars for energy, and [[sodium]] and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this [[mud-puddling]] behaviour is restricted to the males, and studies have suggested that the nutrients collected may be provided as a [[nuptial gift]], along with the spermatophore, during mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00539.x | last1=Molleman |first1=Freerk | last2=Grunsven |first2=Roy H.

In [[Hill-topping (biology)|hilltopping]], males of some species seek hilltops and ridge tops, which they patrol in search for females. Since it usually occurs in species with low population density, it is assumed these landscape points are used as meeting places to find mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gochfeld |first1=Michael |last2=Burger |first2=Joanna |title=Butterflies of New Jersey: A Guide to Their Status, Distribution, Conservation, and Appreciation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SzNCNPkgQcC&amp;pg=PA55 |year=1997 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2355-2 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterflies use their antennae to sense the air for wind and scents. The antennae come in various shapes and colours; the hesperiids have a pointed angle or hook to the antennae, while most other families show knobbed antennae. The antennae are richly covered with sensory organs known as [[sensillum|sensillae]]. A butterfly's sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the [[Arthropod leg#Insects|tarsi]], or feet, which work only on contact, and are used to determine whether an egg-laying insect's offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-butterfly.html |title=Article on San Diego Zoo website |publisher=Sandiegozoo.org |accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many butterflies use chemical signals, [[pheromone]]s; some have specialized scent scales ([[androconia]]) or other structures ([[coremata]] or "hair pencils" in the Danaidae).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Birch |first1=M.

[[File:Butterfly midflight.jpg|thumb|''Heteronympha merope'' taking off]]

Many species of butterfly maintain territories and actively chase other species or individuals that may stray into them. Some species will bask or perch on chosen perches. The flight styles of butterflies are often characteristic and some species have courtship flight displays. Butterflies can only fly when their temperature is above {{convert|27|°C}}; when it is cool, they can position themselves to expose the underside of the wings to the sunlight to heat themselves up. If their body temperature reaches {{convert|40|°C}}, they can orientate themselves with the folded wings edgewise to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Butterflies Make Best Use of the Sunshine |journal=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfHEmTgmHacC&amp;pg=PA13 |date=17 December 1988 |page=13 |issn=0262-4079|author1=Information |first1=Reed Business }}&lt;/ref&gt; Basking is an activity which is more common in the cooler hours of the morning. Some species have evolved dark wingbases to help in gathering more heat and this is especially evident in alpine forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ellers | first1=J. | last2=Boggs | first2=Carol L. | year=2002 | title=The Evolution of Wing Color in ''Colias'' Butterflies: Heritability, Sex Linkage, and population divergence | url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/Pubs/Boggs_pdfs/2002_Ellers_Boggs_Coliaswingcolor.pdf | journal=Evolution | volume=56 | issue=4| pages=836–840 | pmid=12038541 | doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2002)056[0836:teowci]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other insects, the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by butterflies is more than can be accounted for by steady-state, non-transitory [[aerodynamics]]. Studies using ''[[Vanessa atalanta]]'' in a [[wind tunnel]] show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include [[wake capture]], [[vortices]] at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the [[Torkel Weis-Fogh|Weis-Fogh]] '[[clap-and-fling]]' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Srygley | first1=R. B. | last2=Thomas | first2=A. L.

====Parasitoids, predators, and pathogens====
Butterflies are threatened in their early stages by [[parasitoid]]s and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. [[Braconidae|Braconid]] and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some have been used as biological controls of pest butterflies like the [[Pieris brassicae|large white butterfly]].&lt;ref name=Feltwell401&gt;{{cite book |author=Feltwell, J. |title=Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry and Physiology of ''Pieris brassicae'' (Linnaeus) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XnrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA401 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-8638-1 |pages=401–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Pieris rapae|small cabbage white]] was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Burton, Maurice |author2=Burton, Robert |title=International Wildlife Encyclopedia: Brown bear - Cheetah |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WLIOwLemzyQC&amp;pg=PA416 |year=2002 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-7269-8 |page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book |author=Allen, Thomas J. |title=A Field Guide to Caterpillars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SS6s7tck0fIC&amp;pg=PA15 |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803413-1 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parasites and Natural Enemies |url=http://monarchlab.org/biology-and-research/biology-and-natural-history/parasites-natural-enemies |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caterpillars are also affected by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and only a small percentage of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; The bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the [[entomopathogenic fungus]] ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' has proved effective for the same purpose.&lt;ref name=Feltwell429&gt;{{cite book |author=Feltwell, J. |title=Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry and Physiology of ''Pieris Brassicae'' (Linnaeus) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XnrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA429 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-8638-1 |page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endangered Species====
[[Queen Alexandra's birdwing]] is the largest butterfly in the world.  The species is [[List of endangered insects#Other Lepidoptera species|endangered]], and is one of only three (3) insects (the other two being butterflies as well) to be listed on [[CITES#Appendix I|Appendix I]] of [[CITES]], making international trade illegal.&lt;ref name="CITES appendices"&gt;[http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php CITES appendices I, II and III], official website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ocybadistes knightorum|Black grass-dart butterfly]] ''(Ocybadistes knightorum)'' is a butterfly of the family [[Hesperiidae]]. It is endemic to [[New South Wales]]. It has a very limited distribution in the [[Boambee, New South Wales|Boambee]] area.

Butterflies protect themselves from predators by a variety of means.
[[File:Papilio cresphontes larva defensive.JPG|thumb|[[Giant swallowtail]] caterpillar everting its [[osmeterium]] in defence; it is also [[mimesis (biology)|mimetic]], resembling a bird dropping.]]

Chemical defences are widespread and are mostly based on chemicals of plant origin. In many cases the plants themselves evolved these toxic substances as [[plant defense against herbivory|protection]] against herbivores. Butterflies have evolved mechanisms to sequester these plant toxins and use them instead in their own defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.47.091201.145121 | last1=Nishida | first1=Ritsuo | year=2002 | title=Sequestration of Defensive Substances from Plants by Lepidoptera | journal=Annual Review of Entomology | volume=47 | pages=57–92 | pmid=11729069}}&lt;/ref&gt; These defence mechanisms are effective only if they are well advertised; this has led to the evolution of bright colours in unpalatable butterflies ([[aposematism]]). This signal is commonly [[mimicry|mimicked]] by other butterflies, usually only females.  A [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimic]] imitates another species to enjoy the protection of that species' aposematism.&lt;ref name=Edmunds/&gt; The [[Papilio polytes|common Mormon]] of India has female morphs which imitate the unpalatable red-bodied swallowtails, the [[Pachliopta aristolochiae|common rose]] and the [[Pachliopta hector|crimson rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Halloran |first1=Kathryn |last2=Wason |first2=Elizabeth |title=Papilio polytes |url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Papilio_polytes/|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |accessdate=12 September 2015 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Müllerian mimicry]] occurs when aposematic species evolve to resemble each other, presumably to reduce predator sampling rates; ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies from the Americas are a good example.&lt;ref name=Edmunds&gt;{{cite book | author=Edmunds, M. | year=1974 | title=Defence in Animals | publisher=Longman | pages=74–78, 100–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lycaenidae have a false head consisting of eyespots and small tails (false antennae) to deflect attack from the more vital head region.

Butterflies without defences such as toxins or mimicry protect themselves through a flight that is more bumpy and unpredictable than in other species. It is assumed this behavior makes it more difficult for predators to catch them, and is caused by the [[turbulence]] created by the small whirlpools formed by the wings during flight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidescience.org/news/mathematical-butterfly-simulations-provide-new-insights-flight The Mathematical Butterfly: Simulations Provide New Insights On Flight]&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterflies have appeared in art from 3500 years ago in [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Larsen, Torben |year=1994 |title=Butterflies of Egypt |journal=Saudi Aramco World |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=24–27 |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199405/butterflies.of.egypt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ancient [[Mesoamerica]]n city of [[Teotihuacan]], the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on [[Censer|incense burners]]. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a [[jaguar]], and some species were considered to be the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies with fire and warfare persisted into the [[Aztec civilisation]]; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been found among the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] and [[Maya civilisation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |author=Miller, Mary |year=1993 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-27928-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterflies are widely used in objects of art and jewellery: mounted in frames, embedded in resin, displayed in bottles, laminated in paper, and used in some mixed media artworks and furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfjoe.com/tag/furniture/ |title=Table Complete with Real Butterflies Embedded in Resin |accessdate=30 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506094545/http://mfjoe.com/tag/furniture/ |archivedate=6 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[naturalist]] [[Kjell B.

===In mythology and folklore===
[[File:Carl Spitzweg 033.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Der Schmetterlingsjäger'' (The butterfly hunter) painting by [[Carl Spitzweg]], 1840]]
According to [[Lafcadio Hearn]], a butterfly was seen in Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if a butterfly enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad [[omen]]s. When [[Taira no Masakado]] was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in [[Kyoto]] so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened—thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hearn | first=Lafcadio | authorlink=Lafcadio Hearn | year=1904 | title=Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things | titlelink=Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things | publisher=Dover | isbn=978-0-486-21901-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camera Lucida in use drawing small figurine.jpg|thumb|Camera Lucida in use]]
A '''''camera lucida''''' is an [[optical device]] used as a drawing aid by [[artist]]s.

The ''camera lucida'' performs an [[optics|optical]] superimposition of the subject being viewed upon the surface upon which the artist is drawing. The artist sees both scene and drawing surface simultaneously, as in a photographic double exposure. This allows the artist to duplicate key points of the scene on the drawing surface, thus aiding in the accurate rendering of perspective.

==History==
The ''camera lucida'' was patented in 1806 by [[William Hyde Wollaston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Photography:  A Cultural History, 4th ed.|last=Marien|first=Mary Warner|publisher=Pearson|year=2015|isbn=0-205-98894-6|location=New Jersey|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic optics were described 200 years earlier by [[Johannes Kepler]] in his Dioptrice (1611), but there is no evidence he or his contemporaries constructed a working camera lucida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=16|title=The camera lucida in art and science|year=1987|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|author1=Hammond, John  |author2=Austin, Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 19th century, Kepler's description had fallen into oblivion, so Wollaston's claim was never challenged. The term "''camera lucida''" ([[Latin]] "well-lit room" as opposed to ''[[camera obscura]]'' "dark room") is Wollaston's. (cf. Edmund Hoppe, Geschichte der Optik, Leipzig 1926)

While on honeymoon in Italy in 1833, the photographic pioneer [[William Fox Talbot]] used a ''camera lucida'' as a sketching aid. He later wrote that it was a disappointment with his resulting efforts which encouraged him to seek a means to "cause these natural images to imprint themselves durably".

In 2001, artist [[David Hockney]]'s book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' was met with controversy. His argument, known as the [[Hockney-Falco thesis]], is that the notable transition in style for greater precision and visual realism that occurred around the decade of the 1420s is attributable to the artists’ discovery of the capability of optical projection devices, specifically an arrangement using a [[concave mirror]] to project [[real image]]s. Their evidence is based largely on the characteristics of the paintings by great artists of later centuries, such as [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].

The ''camera lucida'' is still available today through art-supply channels but is not well known or widely used. It has enjoyed a resurgence recently through a number of Kickstarter campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/neolucida/neolucida-a-portable-camera-lucida-for-the-21st-ce NeoLucida Kickstarter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:cameralucidadiagram.png|left|framed|Optics of Wollaston ''camera lucida'']]

==Description==
The name "''camera lucida''" (Latin for "light chamber") is obviously intended to recall the much older drawing aid, the ''[[camera obscura]]'' (Latin for "dark chamber"). There is no optical similarity between the devices. The ''camera lucida'' is a light, portable device that does not require special lighting conditions. No image is projected by the ''camera lucida''.

In the simplest form of ''camera lucida'', the artist looks down at the drawing surface through a half-silvered [[mirror]] tilted at 45 degrees. This superimposes a direct view of the drawing surface beneath, and a [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] view of a scene horizontally in front of the artist. This design produces an inverted image which is right-left reversed when turned the right way up. Also, light is lost in the imperfect reflection. Wollaston's design used a prism with four optical faces to produce two successive reflections (see illustration), thus producing an image that is not inverted or reversed. Angles ABC and ADC are 67.5° and BCD is 135°. Hence, the reflections occur through [[total internal reflection]], so very little light is lost. It is not possible to see straight through the prism, so it is necessary to look at the very edge to see the paper.&lt;ref name=hockney-2006&gt;

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The instrument often came with an assortment of weak negative lenses, to create a [[virtual image]] of the scene at several distances. If the right lens is inserted, so that the chosen distance roughly equals the distance of the drawing surface, both images can be viewed in good [[focus (optics)|focus]] simultaneously.

If white paper is used with the ''camera lucida'', the superimposition of the paper with the scene tends to wash out the scene, making it difficult to view. When working with a ''camera lucida'', it is often beneficial to use black paper and to draw with a white pencil.

==Microscopy==
As recently as a few decades ago,{{when|date=December 2015}} the ''camera lucida'' was still a standard tool of [[microscope|microscopists]].  It is still a key tool in the field of palaeontology. Until very recently, [[photomicrograph]]s were expensive to reproduce. Furthermore, in many cases, a clear illustration of the structure that the microscopist wished to document was much easier to produce by drawing than by micrography. Thus, most routine histological and microanatomical illustrations in textbooks and research papers were ''camera lucida'' drawings rather than photomicrographs. The ''camera lucida'' is still used as the most common method among neurobiologists for drawing brain structures, although it is recognised to have limitations. "For decades in cellular neuroscience, camera lucida hand drawings have constituted essential illustrations. (...) The limitations of camera lucida can be avoided by the procedure of digital reconstruction".&lt;ref&gt;Mobilizing the base of neuroscience data: the case of neuronal morphologies, Giorgio A. Ascoli, Nature Reviews, Neuroscience, Vol. 7, April 2006, page 319&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular concern is distortion, and new digital methods are being introduced which can limit or remove this, "computerized techniques result in far fewer errors in data transcription and analysis than the camera lucida procedure".&lt;ref&gt;Distortions induced in neuronal quantification by camera lucida analysis: Comparisons using a semi-automated data acquisition system, T.J. DeVoogd et al, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, Volume 3, Issue 3, February 1981, Pages 285–294&lt;/ref&gt; It is also regularly used in [[biological taxonomy]].

"'''Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut'''" is the second episode of the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 15th episode of the series overall, it premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on April 22, 1998. The episode concludes the storyline of the [[South Park (season 1)|season one]] finale "[[Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut]]"; [[List of recurring South Park characters#Dr. Alphonse Mephisto and Kevin|Mephesto]] is suddenly shot, just as he is about to reveal the identity of [[Eric Cartman]]'s father. The four boys and [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] rush him to Hell's Pass Hospital while the town of South Park experiences a massive blizzard.

The episode aired after the season premiere "[[Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus]]" was aired in its place three weeks earlier as an [[April Fools' Day]] prank. Upset viewers wrote over 2,000 complaints to Comedy Central within a week of its premiere date. In 2013, fans voted "Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut" as the best episode of season two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/summer-of-south-park/season-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628034803/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/summer-of-south-park/season-2 |archivedate=2013-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Just as [[List of recurring South Park characters#Dr. Alphonse Mephisto and Kevin|Mephesto]] is about to announce who [[Eric Cartman]]'s father is, the electricity goes out, the room is darkened, and two gunshots are fired. As the lights come back on, everyone discovers that Mephesto has been shot. [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] notes that he is still alive and, along with the boys, rushes him to the hospital. Upon entering the hospital, they meet [[List of recurring South Park characters#Dr. Doctor|Dr. Doctor]], and a nurse with no arms named Nurse Goodley; they are the only ones working in the hospital. He manages to get Mephesto on a life support system, but has many other patients to tend to. Outside, a terrible blizzard brews.

While the rest of the adults in town and a visiting television crew film a reenactment for ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', a tree falls on the power line causing the power to go out. All of the adults are now stuck in a building until the storm settles. The group hastily resort to [[cannibalism]] to survive. The power also goes out back at the hospital, and a plan is enacted to restore it. Dr. Doctor suggests that they split into two teams: team A, consisting of everyone in the room except [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and team B, consisting of Kenny. His job is to reconnect the generator in the cold, while team A give advice to him via [[walkie-talkie]] as they enjoy some hot cocoa and TV.

Once Kenny gets to the generator, he discovers that there is no wire connecting the cords, so he decides to make the connection himself to restore the electricity, fatally electrocuting himself in the process. Thanks to his brave deed, the power is restored and Mephesto survives. After casually revealing his shooter was his brother, he gathers everyone in the emergency room for the revelation of Cartman's father: his mother [[List of South Park families#Liane Cartman|Liane]]. Mephesto explains that Liane is a [[hermaphrodite]], someone with both male and female genitalia. He also reveals that hermaphrodites cannot have children, so Liane must have impregnated another woman on her intercourse spree. An angered Cartman then demands who is mother is, but when a narrator questions who his mother might be, he quickly refuses to pursue the issue further.

'''Circumpolar studies''' (also ''Northern studies'') is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[field of study]] combining [[social science]] and [[Earth science|geoscience]] and involving topics like [[land]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[Ethnic group|peoples]], [[culture]]s, and [[politics]] in [[Arctic]] and [[Subarctic]] [[Arctic Council|states]], that is, the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Canada]], [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Russia]]. Because of circumpolar regions' past as [[Colonization|colonised]] territories inhabited by [[nomad]]s, circumpolar studies focusses on [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous peoples]] as well as [[Early modern period|early]] [[Agrarian society|agricultural]] [[settler]]s.&lt;ref name="UArctic Circumpolar Studies"/&gt;

== Information ==
Circumpolar studies is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study of regions located on and above the [[Arctic Circle|polar circle]]. As such, circumpolar studies embraces wider than [[Arctic studies]], which deals with the [[Arctic]] ''[[sensu stricto]]''.

Classified as [[Area studies|regional studies]], circumpolar studies finds a parallel in [[European studies]], [[African studies]], [[Latin American studies]], and so on. Gaining increased prominence in the wake of post-[[Cold War]] initiatives like the [[Arctic Council]], circumpolar studies is maintained as an independent field of study by [[University|universities]] like the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] and [[Nord University]] and recognised as ditto by [[Publishing|publishers]] like [[Berghahn Books]].&lt;ref name="UArctic Where to Study"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berghahn Books"/&gt;

Based on a degree model developed by the [[University of the Arctic]], over twenty educational institutions in [[Arctic Circle|circumpolar regions]] offer circumpolar studies at [[Undergraduate degree|undergraduate level]], including [[bachelor's degree]]s and short-term programmes.&lt;ref name="UArctic Where to Study"/&gt; There is also a [[France|French]] university offering circumpolar studies at graduate level.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The Arctic Centre at the [[University of Groningen]] publishes an eponymous series with biennial volumes,&lt;ref name="UG Circumpolar Series"/&gt; while the ''Journal of Northern Studies'' is published at [[Umeå University]]. Related research centres include the [[Center for Northern Studies]] at Nord University.

'''Digital detox''' refers to a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic connecting devices such as smartphones and computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/digital_detox|title=digital detox {{!}} Definition of digital detox in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as an opportunity to reduce stress, focus more on social interaction and connection with nature in the physical world. Claimed benefits include increased [[mindfulness]], lowered anxiety, and an overall better appreciation of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/digital-detox_n_5589474|title=Here's One Big Sign It's Time To Reevaluate Your Relationship With Your Phone|date=2014-07-16|work=HuffPost|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francesbooth/2014/06/13/how-to-do-a-digital-detox/#67da105b65a4|title=How To Do A Digital Detox|last=Booth|first=Frances|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;There have been many stories where a digital detox has lead to a more refreshed feeling along the people involved. They described there digital detox as a "getaway" in some aspect. When people get caught up in how much they need to do, the overuse of technology becomes prevalent. This even becomes the case in a social context; people want to make sure they're up to date on the latest news stories, Instagram posts, political tweets etc. and to do this, they need to stay plugged in. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brown, Sally (Feb 2014). "Switch off: feel chained to your smartphone? Perhaps you're in need of a digital detox" (PDF). ''sallybrowntherapy.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartphones, laptops, and tablets, combined with the increasing wireless Internet accessibility, enable technology users to constantly be connected to the digital world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Morrison, S., &amp; Gomez, R. (2014). "Pushback: The Growth of Expressions of Resistance to Constant Online Connectivity" (PDF). In iConference 2014 Proceedings (p. 1-15).&lt;/ref&gt;Constant online connectivity may have a negative impact on the users’ experience with electronic connecting devices and result in a wish to temporarily refrain from communication technology usage.

In one study in Mind, 95% of those interviewed said their mood improved after putting down their phones to spend time outside, changing from depressed, stressed, and anxious to more calm and balanced. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/enhance-your-wellbeing/environment/nature-and-us/how-does-nature-impact-our-wellbeing|title=How Does Nature Impact Our Wellbeing? {{!}} Taking Charge of Your Health &amp; Wellbeing|website=Taking Charge of Your Health &amp; Wellbeing|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivations behind digital detoxing vary. In some cases, the motivation is negative emotional responses to the technology usage, such as dissatisfaction or disappointment of the technology device and its functions. In other cases, users see the technology as a distracting factor that consumes time and energy and wants to take back control over their everyday lives. Some people have moral, ethical or political reasons to refrain from technology usage. Furthermore, a concern of developing addictive behavior in terms of tech addiction or [[Internet addiction disorder]] is one of the motivations for disconnecting for a period of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;This excessive technology usage can be considered an addiction. It's said that around 50% of smartphone users check their account 5 minutes prior to going to bed and within 5 minutes post waking up. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adgully.com/smartphone-owners-increasingly-obsessed-with-their-devices-deloitte-study-63842.html|title=Smartphone owners in India are increasingly obsessed with their devices: Deloitte Mobile Consumer Survey 2015|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant engagement with digital connecting devices at the workplace is claimed to lead to increased stress levels and reduce productivity. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ayyagari|first=Ramakrishna|last2=Grover|first2=Varun|last3=Purvis|first3=Russell|date=2011|title=Technostress: Technological Antecedents and Implications|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41409963|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=35|issue=4|pages=831–858|doi=10.2307/41409963}}&lt;/ref&gt;Certain characteristics of the technology make it more difficult to distinguish work from leisure. Moreover, being continually connected increases the number of interruptions at work. Allowing employees to disconnect for a part of the day in order to truly focus on their work without disturbance from colleagues is claimed to be beneficial to the productivity and work environment. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''To combat the effects of constant digital exposure, there are digital detox retreats held for select numbers of people. It's an average of 12 people per week getting detoxed for a little less than $600 dollars including flights.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In certain cultures, constant work is encouraged and taking breaks are sometimes even discouraged. This is due to the idea that a break equals a lack of productivity. In the Indian culture, this is extremely prevalent; there have even been studies to back these ideas up. It's said that more than half of Indians check their work and social emails constantly. Even while vacationing, about 30% admitted that they had an irresistible urge to check and post on social media. There is also a significant estimated 30% difference between people being willing to leave their laptops at home compared to people being willing to leave their smartphones at home. It's admitted that if work wasn't a factor a lot of Indians wouldn't constantly be on their devices and stay unplugged. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcquest.com/time-digital-detox/|title=Time for Digital Detox - PCQuest|date=2018-01-10|work=PCQuest|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connecting devices’ multitasking character has a serious impact on the learning ability. Multitasking implies operating on a surface level, which only involves the short-time memory. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10540261/screen-time-ipad-tablet-digital-detox-difital-addiction.html|title=Switch off – it’s time for your digital detox|last=Smith|first=Julia Llewellyn|date=2013-12-28|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;Using multiple connecting devices as learning platforms is therefore not beneficial. A reduction of information choices enables the brain to focus more on the quality of the information rather than the hastiness of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/9_1/brabazon9_1.html|title=Time for a digital detox? - Tara Brabazon - Fast Capitalism 9.1|website=www.uta.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital sociology''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that focuses on understanding the use of [[digital media]] as part of everyday life, and how these various technologies contribute to patterns of human behavior, social relationships and [[Self-concept|concepts of the self]].

The first scholarly article to have the term 'digital sociology' in the title appeared in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, J. (2009) Digital sociology: emergent technologies in the field and the classroom. ''Sociological Forum'', 24(2), 448--456&lt;/ref&gt; The author reflected on the ways in which digital technologies may influence both sociological research and teaching. In 2010, 'digital sociology' was described, by [https://about.me/rrneal Richard Neal], in terms of bridging the growing academic focus with the increasing interest from global business through the publication of the book, ''Expanding Sentience: Introducing Digital Sociology for moving beyond Buzz Metrics in a World of Growing Online Socialization''.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, R. (2010) ''Expanding Sentience: Introducing Digital Sociology for moving beyond Buzz Metrics in a World of Growing Online Socialization.'' Lulu&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2013 that the first purely academic book tackling the subject of 'digital sociology' was published. The edited collection of review chapters addressed a range of topics, including concepts and experiences of space, community, intimacy, the role played by gender and social inequalities in people's use of digital technologies and the impact of these technologies in education, health, finance and war reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Orton-Johnson, K. and Prior, N. (eds) (2013) ''Digital Sociology: Critical Perspectives''. Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; The first sole-authored book entitled ''Digital Sociology'' was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2015) ''Digital Sociology''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The first academic conference on "Digital Sociology" was held in New York, NY in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, J., Gregory, K., Cottom, T.M. Digital Sociology MiniConference, organized in conjunction with the Eastern Sociological Society meetings, February 27–28, 2015. http://digsoc.commons.gc.cuny.edu/conference-papers-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ‘digital sociology’ has not yet fully entered the cultural lexicon, sociologists have engaged in research related to the internet since its inception. These sociologists have addressed many social issues relating to [[online communities]], [[cyberspace]] and cyber-identities. This and similar research has attracted many different names such as 'cybersociology', [[sociology of the Internet|'the sociology of the internet']], 'the sociology of online communities', 'the sociology of social media', 'the sociology of cyberculture' or something else again.

Digital sociology differs from these terms in that it is wider in its scope, addressing not only the internet or [[cyberculture]] but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since the first decade of the twenty-first century. Since the internet has become more pervasive and linked with everyday life, references to the 'cyber' in the social sciences seems now to have been replaced by the 'digital'. 'Digital sociology' is related to other sub-disciplines such as [[digital humanities]] and [[digital anthropology]]. It is beginning to supersede and incorporate the other titles above, as well as including the newest [[Web 2.0]] digital technologies into its purview, such as [[wearable technology]], [[augmented reality]], [[smart objects]], the [[Internet of Things]] and [[big data]].

== Aspects ==

Four aspects of digital sociology have been identified:&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2012) [http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/8621 "Digital sociology: an introduction"]. Sydney: University of Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Professional digital practice''': using digital media tools for professional purposes: to build networks, construct an e-profile, publicise and share research and instruct students.
# '''Sociological analyses of digital use''': researching the ways in which people's use of digital media configures their sense of selves, their embodiment and their social relations.
# '''Digital data analysis''': using digital data for social research, either quantitative or qualitative.
# '''Critical digital sociology''': undertaking reflexive and critical analysis of digital media informed by social and cultural theory.

=== Professional digital practice ===
Although they have been reluctant to use social and other digital media for professional academics purposes, sociologists are slowly beginning to adopt them for teaching and research.&lt;ref&gt;Carrigan, M. (2013) [http://markcarrigan.net/2013/06/06/is-the-use-of-sociological-media-becoming-mainstream-within-uk-sociology/ "The emergence of sociological media? Is social media becoming mainstream within UK sociology?"]. Mark Carrigan.net&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of sociological blogs are beginning to appear and more sociologists are joining Twitter, for example. Some are writing about the best ways for sociologists to employ social media as part of academic practice (see the [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/ LSE Impact of the Social Sciences website]) and the importance of [[self-archiving]] and making sociological research open access,&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2013) [http://simplysociology.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/opening-up-your-research-self-archiving-for-sociologists/ "Opening up your research: self-archiving for sociologists"]. This Sociological Life&lt;/ref&gt; as well as writing for [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;Wadewitz, A. (2013) [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/04/09/change-the-world-edit-wikipedia/ "Wikipedia is pushing the boundaries of scholarly practice but the gender gap must be addressed"]. LSE Impact of the Social Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociological analyses of digital media use ===
Digital sociologists have begun to write about the use of wearable technologies as part of quantifying the body&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2013) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09581596.2013.794931#.UbrhSpN--V4 "Quantifying the body: monitoring and measuring health in the age of mHealth technologies"]. ''Critical Public Health''&lt;/ref&gt; and the social dimensions of big data and the algorithms that are used to interpret these data.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney-Lippold, J. (2011) [http://lass312a14.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/89244152/A-New-Algorithmic-Identity-Soft-Biopolitcs.pdf "A new algorithmic identity: soft biopolitics and the modulation of control"]. ''Theory, Culture &amp; Society'', 28(6), 164-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have directed attention at the role of digital technologies as part of the surveillance of people's activities, via such technologies as [[CCTV cameras]] and customer loyalty schemes&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S. and Wood, D. (2003) [http://csp.sagepub.com/content/23/2/227.full.pdf+html "Digitizing surveillance: categorization, space, inequality"]. ''Critical Social Policy'', 23(2),227-48.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[mass surveillance]] of the internet that is being conducted by secret services such as the [[National Security Agency|NSA]].&lt;!-- [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)]] --&gt;

The '[[digital divide]]', or the differences in access to digital technologies experienced by certain social groups such as the socioeconomically disadvantaged, those of lower education levels, women and the elderly, has preoccupied many researchers in the social scientific study of digital media. However several sociologists have pointed out that while it is important to acknowledge and identify the [[Structural inequality|structural inequalities]] inherent in differentials in digital technology use, this concept is rather simplistic and fails to incorporate the complexities of access to and knowledge about digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, S. and Tranter, B. (2006) [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/chaston/Chaston%20Web%20readings%20chapters%201-12/Chapter%205%20-%2026%20Willis%20&amp;%20Tranter.pdf "Beyond the 'digital divide': Internet diffusion and inequality in Australia"]. Journal of Sociology, 42(1), 43-59&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing interest in the ways in which social media contribute to the development of intimate relationships and concepts of the self. One of the best-known sociologists who has written about social relationships, selfhood and digital technologies is [[Sherry Turkle]].&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (1984) [http://monoskop.org/images/5/55/Turkle_Sherry_The_Second_Self_Computers_and_the_Human_Spirit_20th_ed.pdf "The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit"]. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (1995) [[Life on the Screen|"Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet"]]. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; In her most recent book Turkle addresses the topic of social media.&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2011) ''Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that relationships conducted via these platforms are not as authentic as those encounters that take place "in real life".

Visual media allows the viewer to be a more passive consumer of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynn|first=Jonathan R|title=Digital Sociology: Emergent Technologies in the Field and the Classroom|url=https://www.academia.edu/26473501/Digital_Sociology_Emergent_Technologies_in_the_Field_and_the_Classroom|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are more likely to develop online personas that differ from their personas in the real world. This contrast between the digital world (or 'cyberspace') and the 'real world', however, has been critiqued as ''''digital dualism'''', a concept similar to the '[[The Aura of the Digital|aura of the digital]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, M. (2006) [http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=519 "The Aura of the Digital"], CTheory&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists have argued that relationships conducted through digital media are inextricably part of the 'real world'.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgenson, N. (2012) [http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/83 "When atoms meet bits: social media, the mobile web and augmented revolution"]. ''Future Internet'', 4, 83-91&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'augmented reality' has been used as an alternative, to denote the concept of reality as being altered in some way by the use of digital media but not replaced.

The use of social media for [[social activism]] have also provided a focus for digital sociology. For example, numerous sociological articles,&lt;ref&gt;Maireder, A. and Schwartzenegger, C. (2011) A movement of connected individuals: social media in the Austrian student protests 2009. ''Information, Communication &amp; Society'', 15(2), 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lim, M. (2012) [http://cspo.org/legacy/library/1207150932F24192826YK_lib_LimJoC2012Egypt.pdf "Clicks, cabs, and coffee houses: social media and oppositional movements in Egypt"], 2004-2011. ''Journal of Communication'', 62(2), 231-248.&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one book&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, D. (2013) ''Twitter: Social Communication in the Twitter Age''. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared on the use of such social media platforms as Twitter, [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]] as a means of conveying messages about activist causes and organizing political movements.&lt;!-- [[Social movement theory]] / Digital social movement theory --&gt;

Research has also been done on how racial minorities and the use of technology by racial minorities and other groups.  These "'''digital practice'''" studies explore the ways in which the practices that groups adopt when using new technologies mitigate or reproduce social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. (2014) ''The Digital Practices of African Americans: An Approach to Studying Cultural Change in the Information Society''. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. (2016) "The Content of Our #Characters: Black Twitter as Counterpublic". ''Sociology of Race and Ethnicity'', 2(4) 433 – 449&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital data analysis ===
Digital sociologists use varied approaches to investigating people's use of digital media, both qualitative and quantitative. These include [[Ethnography|ethnographic research]], interviews and surveys with users of technologies, and also the analysis of the data produced from people's interactions with technologies: for example, their posts on social media platforms such as Facebook, [[Reddit]], [[4chan]], [[Tumblr]] and Twitter or their consuming habits on online shopping platforms. Such techniques as [[data scraping]], [[social network analysis]], [[time series analysis]] and [[textual analysis]] are employed to analyse both the data produced as a byproduct of users' interactions with digital media and those that they create themselves. 
For Contents Analysis, in 2008, Yukihiko Yoshida did a study called&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida,Yukihiko, Leni Riefenstahl and German Expressionism: A Study of Visual Cultural Studies Using Transdisciplinary Semantic Space of Specialized Dictionaries ,Technoetic Arts: a journal of speculative research (Editor Roy Ascott),Volume 8, Issue3,intellect,2008&lt;/ref&gt; "Leni Riefenstahl and German expressionism: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans-disciplinary semantic spaces of specialized dictionaries." The study took databases of images tagged with connotative and denotative keywords (a search engine) and found Riefenstahl’s imagery had the same qualities as imagery tagged "degenerate" in the title of the exhibition, "Degenerate Art" in Germany at 1937.

The emergence of social media has provided sociologists with a new way of studying social phenomenon. Social media networks, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], are increasingly being mined for research. For example, Twitter data is easily available to researchers through the Twitter API. Twitter provides researchers with demographic data, time and location data, and connections between users. From these data, researchers gain insight into user moods and how they communicate with one another. Furthermore, social networks can be graphed and visualized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murthy|first=Dhiraj|last2=Bowman|first2=Sawyer A|date=2014-11-25|title=Big Data solutions on a small scale: Evaluating accessible high-performance computing for social research|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951714559105|journal=Big Data &amp; Society|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|doi=10.1177/2053951714559105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using large data sets, like those obtained from Twitter, can be challenging. First of all, researchers have to figure out how to store this data effectively in a database. Several tools commonly used in [[Big data|Big Data]] analytics are at their disposal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since large data sets can be unwieldy and contain numerous types of data (i.e. photos, videos, GIF images), researchers have the option of storing their data in non-relational databases, such as [[MongoDB]] and [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Processing and querying this data is an additional challenge. However, there are several options available to researchers. One common option is to use a querying language, such as [[Apache Hive|Hive]], in conjunction with [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] to analyze large data sets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The internet and social media have allowed sociologists to study how controversial topics are discussed over time—otherwise known as Issue Mapping.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marres|first=Noortje|last2=Gerlitz|first2=Carolin|date=2015-08-14|title=Interface Methods: Renegotiating Relations between Digital Social Research, STS and Sociology|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12314|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=64|issue=1|pages=21–46|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists can search social networking sites (i.e. Facebook or Twitter) for posts related to a hotly-debated topic, then parse through and analyze the text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sociologists can then use a number of easily accessible tools to visualize this data, such as MentionMapp or Twitter Streamgraph. MentionMapp shows how popular a hashtag is and Twitter Streamgraph depicts how often certain words are paired together and how their relationship changes over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Critical digital sociology ===
This aspect of digital sociology is perhaps what makes it distinctive from other approaches to studying the digital world. In adopting a critical reflexive approach, sociologists are able to address the implications of the digital for sociological practice itself. It has been argued that digital sociology offers a way of addressing the changing relations between social relations and the analysis of these relations, putting into question what social research is, and indeed, what sociology is now as social relations and society have become in many respects mediated via digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Marres. N. (2013) [http://www.csisponline.net/2013/01/21/what-is-digital-sociology "What is digital sociology?"] CSISP Online&lt;/ref&gt;

How should sociology respond to the emergent forms of both 'small data' and 'big data' that are collected in vast amounts as part of people's interactions with digital technologies and the development of data industries using these data to conduct their own social research? Does this suggest that a "coming crisis in empirical sociology" might be on the horizon?&lt;ref&gt;Savage, M. and Burrows, R. (2007) [https://www.gold.ac.uk/media/coming-crisis-empirical-sociology.pdf "The coming crisis of empirical sociology"]. ''Sociology'', 41(5),885-889&lt;/ref&gt; How are the identities and work practices of sociologists themselves becoming implicated within and disciplined by digital technologies such as [[Citation impact|citation metrics]]?&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, R. (2012) Living with the h-index? Metric assemblages in the contemporary academy. ''The Sociological Review'', 60(2), 355—72.&lt;/ref&gt;

These questions are central to critical digital sociology, which reflects upon the role of sociology itself in the analysis of digital technologies as well as the impact of digital technologies upon sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2012) [http://simplysociology.wordpress.com/category/digital-sociology/page/2/ "Digital sociology part 3: digital research"]. This Sociological Life&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public digital sociology ===
{{main|Public sociology}}
Public sociology using digital media is a form of public sociology that involves publishing sociological materials in online accessible spaces and subsequent interaction with publics in these spaces. This has been referred to as "e-public sociology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher J. Schneider]] (2014). Social Media and e-Public Sociology. In Ariane Hanemaayer and Christopher J. Schneider, editors, The Public Sociology Debate: Ethics and Engagement, University of British Columbia Press: 205-224&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has changed the ways the public sociology was perceived and given rise to digital evolution in this field. The vast open platform of communication has provided opportunities for sociologists to come out from the notion of small group sociology or publics to a vast audience.

Blogging was the initial social media platform being utilized by sociologists. Sociologists like Eszter Hargittai, Chris Bertram, and Kieran Healy were few amongst those who started using blogging for sociology. New discussion groups about sociology and related philosophy were the consequences of social media impact. The vast number of comments and discussions thus became a part of understanding sociology. One of such famous groups was [http://crookedtimber.org/ Crooked Timber]. Getting feedback on such social sites is faster and impactful. Disintermediation, visibility, and measurement are the major effects of e-public sociology. Other social media tools like Twitter and Facebook also became the tools for a sociologist. [https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/soc-social-media.pdf "Public Sociology in the Age of Social Media"].&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Kieran. "Public Sociology in the Age of Social Media." Berkeley Sociology Journal (2015): 1-16. APA&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DopplerNovel.jpg|thumb|First edition (Norwegian)]]
'''''Doppler''''' is a satirical novel by Norwegian author [[Erlend Loe]]. It was first published in 2004 in Norwegian where it was a 'barnstorming success', selling over 100,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/doppler-by-erlend-loe-translated-by-don-bartlett-and-don-shaw-8386365.html Doppler, By Erlend Loe (translated by Don Bartlett and Don Shaw)], ''[[The Independent]]'' Wednesday 05 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into English in 2012 by Don Bartlett and Don Shaw with the strapline "An elk is for life ... not just for Christmas".

It was identified by [[Salley Vickers]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as one of her books of the year, 'wonderfully subversive, funny and original'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/25/books-of-the-year-2012 Books of the year 2012 | Books | The Observer] Retrieved 2014-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot introduction==
Following the death of his father and after falling off his bike, Doppler decides to abandon his home in [[Oslo]], job, children and pregnant wife and  to live a solitary life in the forest just outside the city. Living in a tent he kills an [[moose|elk]] for food but then discovers it has a young calf which he adopts, names Bongo and with whom he discusses the state of the world he has left behind, with its consumerism and focus on personal success. Doppler determines to live a life as far as possible removed from his previous life but finds it impossible to escape entirely, resorting to bartering and even theft to meet his needs. But his existence gains much unwanted attention and he struggles to maintain his isolation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6278">'''FairMormon''', formerly known as the '''Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research''' ('''FAIR'''), is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization that specializes in [[Mormon apologetics]] and responds to [[Criticism of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|criticism]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44852981/ns/politics-decision_2012/#.TpZTBN4r2sp|title=Romney campaign puts Mormon faith in spotlight|author=|date=17 October 2011|website=msn.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; FairMormon comprises volunteers who seek to answer questions submitted to its web site. It was founded in November 1997 by a group of [[Mormons]] who wanted to defend their faith on [[America Online|AOL]] [[message boards]].&lt;ref&gt;"FAIR originated as an internet-based group in the late 90s …. What happened was that there were religious discussions on the old AOL message boards, and the Mormons were getting pushed around. They were the 98 pound weaklings because they didn’t control the venue. The people that did, limited their access and things like that. So FAIR originated as a group of people banding together electronically for self defense." Kevin Barney, [http://blog.fairmormon.org/2012/10/17/notes-on-apologetics/ Notes on Apologetics], ''FairMormon Blog'', last modified 17 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of FairMormon are international volunteers. FairMormon holds an annual conference where topics of current apologetic issues are presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700247630/FAIR-Sunstone-conferences-are-this-week.html|title=FAIR, Sunstone conferences are this week|first=Lynn|last=Arave|date=2 August 2008|website=deseretnews.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universe.byu.edu/index.php/2011/08/02/2011-fair-conference-will-address-controversial-issues/|title=2011 FAIR Conference will address controversial LDS issues - The Daily Universe|author=|date=2 August 2011|website=byu.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also publishes a monthly electronic newsletter (the ''FairMormon Journal'') and a daily news-clipping service (the ''FairMormon Front Page'').  

There is no official connection between FairMormon and the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;"We’re not affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. However, the members of FairMormon are all committed to defending the Church and helping people to maintain their testimonies." https://www.fairmormon.org/about/faq-html &lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change==
At the August 2013 annual conference it was announced that the organization would change its name from FAIR to FairMormon. The reasoning was explained by Steven {{Proper name|Densley}}, vice-president:

“We have changed our name and are updating our websites in order to make them more easily accessible. The name has been simplified. Instead of The Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research, it is now simply FairMormon. Hopefully this will be easier to remember and will allow us to spend more time doing apologetics rather than spending our time explaining what apologetics is. Our mission has not changed, but hopefully, with the name change and the changes with the websites, our organization will be more effective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/blog/2013/08/23/fair-has-new-nameshaken-faith-syndrome-updated|title=FAIR Has New Name/Shaken Faith Syndrome Updated. - FairMormon|author=|date=23 August 2013|website=fairmormon.org|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officers==
FairMormon is led by a president, who is elected by a board of directors, and assisted by a vice-president and secretary. The current president is Scott Gordon. Several editors provide submitted documents and articles with editorial review, and a bookstore is maintained to sell apologetic articles and scholarly books to the public. All of these positions are handled by volunteers. The only paid part-time position currently associated with FairMormon is the bookstore manager, which requires management.

==Websites==
''Mormon Voices'' is a website run by FairMormon which seeks to defend representations of the LDS Church in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700200094/FAIR-changes-Mormon-defenders-website-name.html|title=FAIR changes Mormon defenders website name|first=Joseph|last=Walker|date=21 November 2011|website=deseretnews.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Website-defending-Mormonism-adopts-softer-name-2282853.php|title=Website defending Mormonism adopts softer name|author=|date=|website=mysanantonio.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Japan}}
{{Culture of Japan}}

The first human habitation in the [[Japanese archipelago]] has been traced to [[Japanese Paleolithic|prehistoric times]]. The [[Jōmon period]], named after its "cord-marked" pottery, was followed by the [[Yayoi]] in the first millennium BC, when new technologies were introduced from continental Asia. During this period, the first known written reference to [[Japan]] was recorded in the Chinese ''[[Book of Han]]'' in the first century AD. Between the fourth century and the ninth century, Japan's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, nominally controlled by the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]. This [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial dynasty]] continues to reign over Japan. In 794, a new imperial capital was established at [[Heian-kyō]] (modern [[Kyoto]]), marking the beginning of the [[Heian period]], which lasted until 1185. The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Japanese religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native [[Shinto]] practices and [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]].

Over the following centuries the power of the Emperor and the imperial court gradually declined and passed to the military clans and their armies of [[samurai]] warriors. The [[Minamoto clan]] under [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] emerged victorious from the [[Genpei War]] of 1180–85. After seizing power, Yoritomo set up his capital in [[Kamakura]] and took the title of ''[[shōgun]]''. In 1274 and 1281, the [[Kamakura shogunate]] withstood two [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]], but in 1333 it was toppled by a rival claimant to the shogunate, ushering in the [[Muromachi period]]. During the Muromachi period regional warlords called ''[[daimyō]]s'' grew in power at the expense of the ''shōgun''. Eventually, Japan descended into a [[Sengoku period|period of civil war]]. Over the course of the late sixteenth century, Japan was reunified under the leadership of the ''daimyō'' [[Oda Nobunaga]] and his successor [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. After Hideyoshi's death in 1598, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] came to power and was appointed ''shōgun'' by the Emperor. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which governed from [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]), presided over a prosperous and peaceful era known as the [[Edo period]] (1600–1868). The Tokugawa shogunate imposed [[Edo society#Four Classes|a strict class system]] on Japanese society and [[Sakoku|cut off almost all contact with the outside world]].

Portugal and Japan started their first affiliation in 1543, making the Portuguese the first Europeans to reach Japan by landing in the southern archipelago of Japan. The Netherlands were the first to establish trade relations with Japan, [[Japan–Netherlands relations]] dating back to 1609. The American [[Perry Expedition]] in 1853–54 more completely ended Japan's seclusion; this contributed to the [[Bakumatsu|fall of the shogunate]] and the [[Meiji Restoration|return of power to the Emperor]] in 1868. The [[Meiji oligarchy|new national leadership]] of the following [[Meiji period]] transformed the isolated feudal [[island country]] into [[Empire of Japan|an empire]] that closely followed Western models and became a [[great power]]. Although democracy developed and modern civilian culture prospered during the [[Taishō period]] (1912–26), Japan's powerful military had great autonomy and overruled Japan's civilian leaders in the 1920s and 1930s. The military [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]] in 1931, and from 1937 the conflict escalated into a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|prolonged war with China]]. Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 led to [[Pacific War|war with the United States]] and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Japan's forces soon became overextended, but the military held out in spite of [[Air raids on Japan|Allied air attacks]] that inflicted severe damage on population centers. Emperor [[Hirohito]] announced Japan's [[Surrender of Japan|unconditional surrender]] on 15 August 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]].

The [[Occupation of Japan|Allies occupied Japan]] until 1952, during which a [[Constitution of Japan|new constitution]] was enacted in 1947 that transformed Japan into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. After 1955, Japan enjoyed [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|very high economic growth]], and became a world [[Economy of Japan|economic powerhouse]]. Since the 1990s, [[Lost Decade (Japan)|economic stagnation]] has been a major issue. An [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami in 2011]] caused massive economic dislocations and a serious [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|nuclear power disaster]].

==Geographical background==
The mountainous [[Japanese archipelago]] stretches northeast to southwest 3,000{{nnbsp}}km off the east of the Asian continent at the convergence of four tectonic plates; it has about forty active volcanoes and experiences about 1,000 earthquakes a year. The steep, craggy mountains that cover two-thirds of its surface are prone to quick erosion from fast-flowing rivers and to mudslides. They have hampered internal travel and communication and driven the population to rely on transportation along coastal waters. There is a great variety to its regions' geographical features and weather patterns, with a [[rainy season]] in most parts in early summer. Volcanic soil that washes along the 13% of the area that makes up the coastal plains provides fertile land, and the mainly temperate climate allows long growing seasons, which with the diversity of flora and fauna provide rich resources able to support the density of the population.{{sfn|Schirokauer|2013|pp=128–130}}

[[Land bridge]]s, during glacial periods when the world sea level is lower, have periodically linked the [[Japanese archipelago]] to the Asian continent via [[Sakhalin]] Island in the north and via the [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[Taiwan]] in the south since the beginning of the current [[Quaternary glaciation]] 2.58 million years ago. There may also have been a land bridge to [[Korea]] in the southwest, though not in the 125,000 years or so since the start of the last interglacial. The Korea Strait was, however, quite narrow at the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] from 25,000 to 20,000 years BP. The earliest firm evidence of human habitation is of early Upper [[Paleolithic]] hunter-gatherers from 40,000 years ago, when Japan was separated from the continent. Edge-ground axes dating to 32–38,000 years ago found in 224 sites in [[Honshu]] and [[Kyushu]] are unlike anything found in neighbouring areas of continental Asia,&lt;ref name="Nuria2014"&gt;Sanz, 157–159.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been proposed as evidence for the first ''Homo sapiens'' in Japan; watercraft appear to have been in use in this period.&lt;ref name=axe&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618211000504|title=MIS3 edge-ground axes and the arrival of the first Homo sapiens in the Japanese archipelago|work=Quaternary International Vol. 248, 70–78|author=Tsutsumi Takashi|date=January 18, 2012|accessdate=September 4, 2015|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2011.01.030|volume=248|pages=70–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating]] has shown that the earliest [[fossil]]s in Japan date back to around 32,000-27,000 years ago; for example in the case of [[Yamashita Cave Man|Yamashita Cave]] 32,100 ± 1,000 BP, in Sakitari Cave cal 31,000–29,000 BP,&lt;ref name="Fujita2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fujita|first=Masaki|title=Advanced maritime adaptation in the western Pacific coastal region extends back to 35,000–30,000 years before present|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/40/11184.full|date=2016|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=113|issue=40|page=11184|doi=10.1073/pnas.1607857113|pmc=5056111}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Shiraho Saonetabaru Cave Ruins|Shiraho Saonetabaru Cave]] c. 27,000 BP among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shinoda|first1=Ken-ichi|last2=Adachi|first2=Noboru|title=Ancient DNA Analysis of Palaeolithic Ryukyu Islanders|date=2017|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n2320/pdf/ch03.pdf|journal=Terra Australis|volume=45|publisher=ANU Press|location=Canberra, Australia|pages=51–59|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shuji1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsu'ura|first=Shuji|title=A Chronological Review of Pleistocene Human Remains from the Japanese Archipelago|url=http://publications.nichibun.ac.jp/region/d/NSH/series/kosh/1999-03-31/s001/s017/pdf/article.pdf|date=1999|journal=Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the Origins of the Japanese|pages=181–197|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakagawa2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nakagawa|first=Ryohei|title=Pleistocene human remains from Shiraho-Saonetabaru Cave on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, Japan, and their radiocarbon dating|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/118/3/118_091214/_pdf|date=2010|journal=Anthropological Science|publisher=The Anthropological Society of Nippon|volume=118|issue=3|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jōmon period of prehistoric Japan spans from about 12,000 BC&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-japan.org/trends00/honbun/tj990615.html Jomon Fantasy: Resketching Japan's Prehistory]. June 22, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; (in some cases dates as early as 14,500 BC are given&lt;ref&gt;Habu, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;) to about 800 BC.&lt;ref name="Silberman2012"&gt;Silberman et al., 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was inhabited by a [[hunter-gatherer]] culture that reached a considerable degree of [[sedentism]] and cultural complexity. The name "cord-marked" was first applied by the American scholar [[Edward S. Morse]] who discovered [[Sherd|shards]] of [[Jōmon pottery|pottery]] in 1877 and subsequently translated it into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as ''jōmon''.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery style characteristic of the first phases of Jōmon culture was decorated by impressing cords into the surface of wet clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuzmin | first1 = Y.

New technologies and modes of living took over from the Jōmon culture, spreading from northern Kyushu. The date of the change was until recently thought to be around 400 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Batten, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but radio-carbon evidence suggests a date up to 500 years earlier, between 1,000 and 800 BC.&lt;ref name="Silberman2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SchirokauerBrown2012"/&gt; The period was named after a district in Tokyo where a new, unembellished style of pottery was discovered in 1884. Though hunting and foraging continued, the Yayoi period brought a new reliance on agriculture.&lt;ref name="SchirokauerBrown2012"/&gt; Bronze and iron weapons and tools were imported from China and Korea; such tools were later also produced in Japan.&lt;ref name="Imamura1996"&gt;Imamura, 168–170.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yayoi period also saw the introduction of weaving and silk production,&lt;ref&gt;Kaner, 462.&lt;/ref&gt; glassmaking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassart.org/1998BriefHistoryOfJapaneseGlass.html|title=A Brief History of Japanese Glass |work=Glass Art Society|author=Yoshio Tsuchiya|year=1998|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new techniques of woodworking.&lt;ref name="SchirokauerBrown2012"/&gt;

The Yayoi technologies originated on the Asian mainland. There is debate among scholars as to what extent their spread was accomplished by means of migration or simply a diffusion of ideas, or a combination of both. The migration theory is supported by genetic and linguistic studies.&lt;ref name="SchirokauerBrown2012"&gt;Schirokauer et al., 133–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanihara Kazurō has suggested that the annual immigrant influx from the continent ranged from 350 to 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Maher, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Japanese are genetically more similar to the Yayoi people than to the [[Jōmon people]]—though more so in southern Japan than in the north—whereas the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] bear significant resemblance to the Jōmon people.&lt;ref name="henshall 11–12"&gt;Henshall, 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; It took time for the Yayoi people and their descendants to fully displace or intermix with the Jōmon, who continued to exist in northern Honshu until the eighth century AD.&lt;ref name="Henshall, 13"&gt;Henshall, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Japan began to increase rapidly, perhaps with a 10-fold rise over the Jōmon. Calculations of the population size have varied from 1.5 to 4.5 million by the end of the Yayoi.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Skeletal remains from the late Jōmon period reveal a deterioration in already poor standards of health and nutrition, in contrast to Yayoi archaeological sites where there are large structures suggestive of grain storehouses. This change was accompanied by an increase in both the [[social stratification|stratification]] of society and tribal warfare, indicated by segregated gravesites and military fortifications.&lt;ref name="SchirokauerBrown2012"/&gt; [[Yoshinogari site]], a large moated village of the period, began to be excavated by archaeologists in the late-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Song-Nai Rhee et al., "Korean Contributions to Agriculture, Technology, and State Formation in Japan", ''Asian Perspectives'', Fall 2007, 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Yayoi period, the Yayoi tribes gradually coalesced into a number of kingdoms. The earliest written work of history to mention Japan, the ''[[Book of Han]]'' completed around 82 AD, states that Japan, referred to as [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]], was divided into one hundred kingdoms. A later Chinese work of history, the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms#Book of Wei (魏書)|Wei Zhi]]'', states that by 240&amp;nbsp;AD one powerful kingdom had gained ascendancy over the others. According to the ''Wei Zhi'', this kingdom was called [[Yamatai]], though modern historians continue to debate its location and other aspects of its depiction in the ''Wei Zhi''. Yamatai was said to have been ruled by the female monarch [[Himiko]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kofun period (c. 250–538)===
{{Main|Kofun period}}
[[File:NintokuTomb.jpg|thumb|Daisenryō Kofun, [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]]]]
During the subsequent Kofun period, most of Japan gradually unified under a single kingdom. The symbol of the growing power of Japan's new leaders was the ''[[kofun]]'' burial mounds they constructed from around 250 onwards.&lt;ref name="kofun"&gt;Henshall, 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many were of massive scale, such as the {{illm|Daisenryō Kofun|ja|大仙陵古墳}}, a 486&amp;nbsp;m-long keyhole-shaped burial mound that took huge teams of laborers fifteen years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kofun'' were often surrounded by and filled with numerous ''[[haniwa]]'' clay sculptures, often in the shape of warriors and horses.&lt;ref name="kofun"/&gt;

The center of the unified state was [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] in the [[Kinai]] region of central Japan.&lt;ref name="kofun"/&gt; The rulers of the Yamato state were a hereditary line of Emperors who still reign as the world's longest dynasty. The rulers of the Yamato extended their power across Japan through military conquest, but their preferred method of expansion was to convince local leaders to accept their authority in exchange for positions of influence in the government.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 16, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the powerful local clans who joined the Yamato state became known as the ''[[Uji (clan)|uji]]''.&lt;ref name="Conrad"/&gt;

[[File:Yamato en.png|thumb|left|alt=|Territorial extent of Yamato court during the Kofun period]]
These leaders sought and received formal diplomatic recognition from China, and Chinese accounts record five successive such leaders as the [[Five kings of Wa]]. Craftsmen and scholars from China and the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] played an important role in transmitting continental technologies and administrative skills to Japan during this period.&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;Totman, 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asuka period (538–710){{efn|The dates of the Asuka period are not widely agreed upon, with some historians, particularly art historians, dividing the period 538–710 into two or more periods. Others take a later start date for the Asuka period, for example starting it in 592 with the accession of [[Empress Suiko]].}}===
{{Main|Asuka period}}
The Asuka period began in 538 AD with the introduction of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religion from the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korean kingdom]] of [[Baekje]].&lt;ref name="kodansha"&gt;''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan Volume One'' (New York: Kodansha, 1983), 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Buddhism has coexisted with Japan's native [[Shinto]] religion, in what is today known as [[Shinbutsu-shūgō]].&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 16, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The period draws its name from the ''de facto'' imperial capital, [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], in the [[Kinai]] region.&lt;ref name="kodansha"/&gt;

The Buddhist [[Soga clan]] took over the government in 587 and controlled Japan from behind the scenes for nearly sixty years.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Shōtoku]], an advocate of Buddhism and of the Soga cause, who was of partial Soga descent, served as regent and ''de facto'' leader of Japan from 594 to 622. Shōtoku authored the [[Seventeen-article constitution]], a [[Confucian]]-inspired code of conduct for officials and citizens, and attempted to introduce a merit-based civil service called the [[Twelve Level Cap and Rank System|Cap and Rank System]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 607, Shōtoku offered a subtle insult to China by opening his letter with the phrase, "The sovereign of the land where the sun rises is sending this mail to the sovereign of the land where the sun sets" as seen in the kanji characters for Japan (Nippon) thus indicating that sun's full strength originates with Japan and China receives the waning sun.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; By 670 a variant of this expression, ''Nihon'', established itself as the official name of the nation, which has persisted to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Song-Nai Rhee et al., "Korean Contributions to Agriculture, Technology, and State Formation in Japan", ''Asian Perspectives'', Fall 2007, 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nihon.png|thumb|alt=Nihon|The word ''Nihon'' written in [[kanji]] (horizontal placement of characters). The text means "Japan" in Japanese.]]
[[File:Prince Shotoku.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|[[Prince Shōtoku]] was a semi-legendary [[regent]] and a politician of the [[Asuka period]].]]

In 645, the Soga clan were overthrown in [[Isshi Incident|a coup]] launched by [[Emperor Tenji|Prince Naka no Ōe]] and [[Fujiwara no Kamatari]], the founder of the [[Fujiwara clan]].&lt;ref name="ritsuryo"&gt;Totman, 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Their government devised and implemented the far-reaching [[Taika Reform]]s. The reforms nationalized all land in Japan, to be [[Equal-field system|distributed equally]] among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[Jinshin War]] of 672, a bloody conflict between [[Prince Ōama]] and his nephew [[Prince Ōtomo]], two rivals to the throne, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.&lt;ref name="ritsuryo"/&gt; These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the [[Taihō Code]], which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central government and its subordinate local governments.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; These legal reforms created the ''[[ritsuryō]]'' state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.&lt;ref name="ritsuryo"/&gt;

===Nara period (710–794)===
{{Main|Nara period}}
In 710, the government constructed a grandiose new capital at [[Heijō-kyō]] (modern [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]) modeled on [[Chang'an]], the capital of the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]]. During this period, the first two books produced in Japan appeared: the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; which contain chronicles of legendary accounts of early Japan and its [[Japanese creation myth|creation myth]], which describes the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial line]] as descendants of [[kami|the gods]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter half of the eighth century saw the compilation of the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'', widely considered the finest collection of Japanese poetry.&lt;ref name="manyoshu"&gt;Keene 1999: 85, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Japan suffered a series of natural disasters, including wildfires, droughts, famines, and outbreaks of disease, such as a [[735–737 Japanese smallpox epidemic|smallpox epidemic in 735-737]] that killed over a quarter of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperor Shōmu]] (r.&amp;nbsp;724–49) feared his lack of piousness had caused the trouble and so increased the government's promotion of Buddhism, including the construction of the temple [[Tōdai-ji]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The funds to build this temple were raised in part by the influential Buddhist monk [[Gyōki]], and once completed it was used by the Chinese monk [[Ganjin]] as an [[ordination#Buddhism|ordination]] site.&lt;ref&gt;Deal and Ruppert, 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan nevertheless entered a phase of population decline that continued well into the following [[Heian period]].&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heian period (794–1185)===
{{Main|Heian period}}
[[File:西寺復元模型.jpg|thumb|Miniature model of [[Heian-kyō]]]]
In 784, the capital moved briefly to [[Nagaoka-kyō]], then again in 794 to [[Heian-kyō]] (modern [[Kyoto]]), which remained the capital until 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Political power within the court soon passed to the [[Fujiwara clan]], a family of court nobles who grew increasingly close to the imperial family through intermarriage.&lt;ref name="fujiwara"&gt;Henshall, 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 858, [[Fujiwara no Yoshifusa]] had himself declared ''[[sesshō]]'' ("regent") to the underage Emperor. His son [[Fujiwara no Mototsune]] created the office of ''[[kampaku]]'', which could rule in the place of an adult reigning Emperor. [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]], a skilled statesman who became ''kampaku'' in 996, governed during the height of the Fujiwara clan's power&lt;ref name="Heian"&gt;Totman, 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt; and had four of his daughters married to Japanese Emperors.&lt;ref name="fujiwara"/&gt; The Fujiwara clan held on to power until 1086, when [[Emperor Shirakawa]] ceded the throne to his son [[Emperor Horikawa]] but continued to exercise political power, establishing the practice of [[cloistered rule]],&lt;ref name=insei&gt;Keene 1999 : 306.&lt;/ref&gt; by which the reigning Emperor would function as a figurehead while real power was held by a retired predecessor behind the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Heian period, the power of the imperial court declined. The court became so self-absorbed with power struggles, and with the artistic pursuits of court nobles, that it neglected the administration of government outside the capital.&lt;ref name="fujiwara"/&gt; The nationalization of land undertaken as part of the ''[[ritsuryō]]'' state decayed as various noble families and religious orders succeeded in securing tax-exempt status for their private ''[[shōen]]'' manors.&lt;ref name="Heian"/&gt; By the eleventh century, more land in Japan was controlled by ''shōen'' owners than by the central government. The imperial court was thus deprived of the tax revenue to pay for its national army. In response, the owners of the ''shōen'' set up their own armies of [[samurai]] warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Two powerful noble families that had descended from branches of the imperial family,&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Taira clan|Taira]] and [[Minamoto clan]]s, acquired large armies and many ''shōen'' outside the capital. The central government began to employ these two warrior clans to help suppress rebellions and piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Japan's population stabilized during the late-Heian period after hundreds of years of decline,&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; this was accompanied by the growth of a new class of slaves composed of poor farmers, debtors, and criminals sold into bondage.&lt;ref name="class"/&gt;

During the early Heian period, the imperial court successfully consolidated its control over the [[Emishi]] people of northern Honshu.&lt;ref name="emishi"&gt;McCullough, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ōtomo no Otomaro]] was the first man the court granted the title of ''seii tai-shōgun'' ("Great Barbarian Subduing General").&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In 802, seii tai-shōgun [[Sakanoue no Tamuramaro]] subjugated the [[Emishi]] people, who were led by [[Aterui]].&lt;ref name="emishi"/&gt; By 1051, members of the [[Abe clan]], who occupied key posts in the regional government, were openly defying the central authority. The court requested the Minamoto clan to engage the Abe clan, whom they defeated in the [[Former Nine Years War]].&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, 249–250.&lt;/ref&gt; The court, thus, temporarily reasserted its authority in northern Japan. Following another civil war&amp;nbsp;– the [[Later Three-Year War]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Fujiwara no Kiyohira]] took full power; his family, the [[Northern Fujiwara]], controlled northern Honshu for the next century from their capital [[Hiraizumi]].&lt;ref&gt;Takeuchi, 675–677.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 812–814 CE, a smallpox epidemic killed almost half of the Japanese population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Suzanne Austin Alchon|title=A Pest in the Land: New World Epidemics in a Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2003|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-2871-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1156, [[Hōgen Rebellion|a dispute over succession to the throne]] erupted and the two rival claimants ([[Emperor Go-Shirakawa]] and [[Emperor Sutoku]]) hired the Taira and Minamoto clans in the hopes of securing the throne by military force. During this war, the Taira clan led by [[Taira no Kiyomori]] defeated the Minamoto clan. Kiyomori used his victory to accumulate power for himself in Kyoto and even installed his own grandson [[Emperor Antoku|Antoku]] as Emperor. The outcome of this war led to the rivalry between the Minamoto and Taira clans. As a result, the dispute and power struggle between both clans led to the [[Heiji Rebellion]] in 1160. In 1180, Taira no Kiyomori was challenged by an uprising led by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]], a member of the Minamoto clan whom Kiyomori had exiled to Kamakura.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Taira no Kiyomori died in 1181, the ensuing bloody [[Genpei War]] between the Taira and Minamoto families continued for another four years. The victory of the Minamoto clan was sealed in 1185, when a force commanded by Yoritomo's younger brother, [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]], scored a decisive victory at the naval [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]]. Yoritomo and his retainers, thus, became the ''de facto'' rulers of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heian culture====
[[File:Genji emaki TAKEKAWA.jpg|thumb|alt=|A handscroll painting dated {{circa|1130}}, illustrating a scene from the "Bamboo River" chapter of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'']]
During the Heian period, the imperial court was a vibrant center of high art and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Its literary accomplishments include the poetry collection ''[[Kokinshū]]'' and the ''[[Tosa Diary]]'', both associated with the poet [[Ki no Tsurayuki]], as well as [[Sei Shōnagon]]'s collection of miscellany ''[[The Pillow Book]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'', considered the supreme masterpiece of Japanese literature.&lt;ref name="genji"&gt;Keene 1999: 477–478.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the [[kana]] written syllabaries was part of a general trend of declining Chinese influence during the Heian period. The Japanese missions to [[Tang dynasty]] of China, which began in the year 630,&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Milton W., page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; ended during the ninth century and thereafter more typically Japanese forms of art and poetry developed.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A major architectural achievement, apart from Heian-kyō itself, was the temple of [[Byōdō-in]] built in 1053 in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]].&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late post-classical Japan==

===Kamakura period (1185–1333)===
{{Main|Kamakura period}}
Upon the consolidation of power, [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] chose to rule in consort with the imperial court in Kyoto. Though Yoritomo set up his own government in [[Kamakura]] in the [[Kantō region]] located in eastern Japan, its power was legally authorized by the Imperial court in Kyoto in several occasions. In 1192, the Emperor declared Yoritomo ''seii tai-shōgun'' ({{lang|ja|征夷大将軍}}; ''Eastern Barbarian Subduing Great General''), abbreviated ''[[shōgun]]''.&lt;ref name="kamakura"&gt;Henshall, 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Later (in Edo period), the word ''[[bakufu]]'' ({{lang|ja|幕府}}; originally means a general's house or office, literally a "tent office") came to be used to mean a government headed by a shogun. The English term ''shogunate'' refers to the ''bakufu''.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan remained largely under military rule until 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legitimacy was conferred on the shogunate by the Imperial court, but the shogunate were the ''de facto'' rulers of the country. The court maintained bureaucratic and religious functions, and the shogunate welcomed participation by members of the aristocratic class. The older institutions remained intact in a weakened form, and Kyoto remained the official capital. This system has been contrasted with the "simple warrior rule" of the later Muromachi period.&lt;ref name="kamakura"/&gt;

While the {{illm|Ise Heishi|ja|伊勢平氏|lt=Ise branch}} of the Taira, which had fought against Yoritomo, was extinguished, other branches, as well as the [[Hōjō clan|Hōjō]], [[Chiba clan|Chiba]], [[Hatakeyama clan|Hatakeyama]] and other families descended from the Taira, continued to thrive in eastern Japan, with some (notably the Hōjō) attaining high positions in the Kamakura shogunate.&lt;ref name="taira survival"&gt;''[[MyPaedia]]'' article "Heishi".&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2015}}&lt;!-- A quote provided from Farris on the talk page indicated that he only verified some of this material, so MyPaedia can't be removed yet, but it is nevertheless an unattractive citation. Obviously a secondary, scholarly source written in English would be superior, and should be retrieved. However, it needs to verify the text as written, which is unlikely to be improved upon by being compromised to match some other source. ~Hijiri88, October 2015. --&gt; Yoshitsune was initially harbored by [[Fujiwara no Hidehira]], the grandson of Kiyohira and the de facto ruler of northern Honshu. In 1189, after Hidehira's death, his successor [[Fujiwara no Yasuhira|Yasuhira]] attempted to curry favor with Yoritomo by attacking Yoshitsune's home. Although Yoshitsune was killed, Yoritomo still invaded and conquered the Northern Fujiwara clan's territories.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent centuries, Yoshitsune would become a legendary figure, portrayed in countless works of literature as an idealized tragic hero.&lt;ref name="yoshitsune"&gt;Keene 1999 : 892–893, 897.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Yoritomo's death in 1199, the office of shogun weakened. Behind the scenes, Yoritomo's wife [[Hōjō Masako]] became the true power behind the government. In 1203, her father, [[Hōjō Tokimasa]], was appointed regent to the shogun, Yoritomo's son [[Minamoto no Sanetomo]]. Henceforth, the Minamoto shoguns became puppets of the [[Hōjō clan|Hōjō regents]], who wielded actual power.&lt;ref name="minamoto"&gt;Weston, 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regime that Yoritomo had established, and which was kept in place by his successors, was decentralized and feudalistic in structure, in contrast with the earlier ritsuryō state. Yoritomo selected the provincial governors, known under the titles of ''[[shugo]]'' or ''[[jitō]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; from among his close vassals, the ''[[gokenin]]''. The Kamakura shogunate allowed its vassals to maintain their own armies and to administer law and order in their provinces on their own terms.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1221, the retired [[Emperor Go-Toba]] instigated what became known as the [[Jōkyū War]], a rebellion against the shogunate, in an attempt to restore political power to the court. The rebellion was a failure, and led to Go-Toba himself being exiled to [[Oki Island]], along with two other Emperors, the retired [[Emperor Tsuchimikado]] and [[Emperor Juntoku]], who were exiled to [[Tosa Province]] and [[Sado Island]] respectively.&lt;ref name=jokyu&gt;Keene 1999 : 672, 831.&lt;!-- Most of this information appears on both pages. "restore political power" isn't directly backed up, but 831 says "overthrow the Hojo regents". ~Hijiri88, October 2015. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The shogunate further consolidated its political power relative to the Kyoto aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The samurai armies of the whole nation were mobilized in 1274 and 1281 to confront [[Mongol invasions of Japan|two full-scale invasions]] launched by [[Kublai Khan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, 441–442.&lt;/ref&gt; Though outnumbered by an enemy equipped with superior weaponry, the Japanese fought the Mongols to a standstill in Kyushu on both occasions until the Mongol fleet was destroyed by typhoons called ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'', meaning "divine wind". In spite of the Kamakura shogunate's victory, the defense so depleted its finances that it was unable to provide compensation to its vassals for their role in the victory. This had permanent negative consequences for the shogunate's relations with the samurai class.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discontent among the samurai proved decisive in ending the Kamakura shogunate. In 1333, [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] launched a rebellion in the hope of restoring full power to the imperial court. The shogunate sent General [[Ashikaga Takauji]] to quell the revolt, but Takauji and his men instead joined forces with Emperor Go-Daigo and overthrew the Kamakura shogunate.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan nevertheless entered a period of prosperity and population growth starting around 1250.&lt;ref name="population"/&gt; In rural areas, the greater use of iron tools and fertilizer, improved irrigation techniques, and [[double-cropping]] increased productivity and rural villages grew.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer famines and epidemics allowed cities to grow and commerce to boom.&lt;ref name="population"/&gt; Buddhism, which had been largely a religion of the elites, was brought to the masses by prominent monks, such as [[Hōnen]] (1133–1212), who established [[Pure Land Buddhism]] in Japan, and [[Nichiren]] (1222–82), who founded [[Nichiren Buddhism]]. [[Zen]] Buddhism spread widely among the samurai class.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary developments of the late-Heian and Kamakura periods===
''[[Waka (poetry)|Waka]]'' poetry flourished in the late Heian and early Kamakura periods.

The aristocrat [[Fujiwara no Shunzei]] was "the leading poet of [his] day"&lt;ref name="keene 321"&gt;Keene 1999 : 321.&lt;/ref&gt; and on a request from [[Emperor Go-Shirakawa]] compiled the ''[[Senzai Wakashū]]'' the seventh [[chokusenshū|imperial collection]].&lt;ref name="keene 320"&gt;Keene 1999 : 320.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Keene]] noted that Shunzei was "the most eminent poet since [[Ki no Tsurayuki|Tsurayuki]] to have been charged with the compilation of an imperial collection".&lt;ref name="keene 323"&gt;Keene 1999 : 323.&lt;/ref&gt; The anthology, commissioned in 1183 but not completed until 1188, after the defeat of the Taira, contained poems by Taira adherents who had been officially denounced as enemies of the throne, as a gesture to calm the vengeful spirits of the Taira.&lt;ref name="keene 321 322"&gt;Keene 1999 : 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt; It also contained poems by thirty-three female poets, the most women recognized by any of the late-Heian imperial collections.&lt;ref name="keene 324"&gt;Keene 1999 : 324.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fujiwara no Teika|Teika]], Shunzei's son,&lt;ref name="keene 650 651"&gt;Keene 1999 : 650–651.&lt;/ref&gt; would become even more important: his ''[[Hyakunin Isshu]]'' made him "the arbiter of the poetic tastes of most Japanese even as late as the twentieth century".&lt;ref name="keene 674"&gt;Keene 1999 : 674.&lt;/ref&gt; His later work copying manuscripts was of such importance that Keene noted that "what we know of the literature of Teika's day and earlier is mainly what he thought was worthy of preservation."&lt;ref name="keene 673 674"&gt;Keene 1999 : 673–674.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served on the committee that compiled the eighth imperial anthology, the ''[[Shin Kokin Wakashū]]'',&lt;ref name="keene 657"&gt;Keene 1999 : 657.&lt;/ref&gt; and along with the itinerant monk [[Saigyō]] and [[Emperor Go-Toba]], is considered one of the best poets represented in the collection.&lt;ref name="keene 643"&gt;Keene 1999 : 643.&lt;/ref&gt; More poems by Saigyō were included in the collection than those of any other poet.&lt;ref name="keene 680"&gt;Keene 1999 : 680.&lt;/ref&gt; and centuries later [[Matsuo Bashō]] selected him as the representative poet of the ''waka'' genre.&lt;ref name="keene 681"&gt;Keene 1999 : 681.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third shogun, [[Minamoto no Sanetomo]], was the first distinctive new poet of the Kamakura period,&lt;ref name="keene 700"&gt;Keene 1999 : 700.&lt;/ref&gt; and he studied the art under Teika's tutelage.&lt;ref name="keene 700 701"&gt;Keene 1999 : 700–701.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Sanetomo's admirers include [[Kamo no Mabuchi]]&lt;ref name="keene 702 703"&gt;Keene 1999 : 702–703.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saitō Mokichi]].&lt;ref name="keene 701"&gt;Keene 1999 : 701.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zen monks were associated with the composition of [[Kanshi (poetry)|poetry in Chinese]],&lt;ref name="keene 736"&gt;Keene 1999 : 736.&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one Zen monk, [[Shōtetsu]], was notable for his contributions to the ''waka'' medium.&lt;ref name="keene 735 736"&gt;Keene 1999 : 735–736.&lt;/ref&gt; After Shōtetsu, however, ''waka'' composition became an oddity until modern times.&lt;ref name="keene 736"/&gt;

The Kamakura period saw an explosion in the popularity of a new genre: the "war tale" (''[[gunki monogatari]]''), whose early representative works include the ''[[Hōgen Monogatari]]'', ''[[Heiji Monogatari]]'' and ''[[The Tale of the Heike|Heike Monogatari]]''.&lt;ref name="gunkimono dates"&gt;Keene 1999 : 617, 629.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter work, which recounted the rise and fall of the Taira clan, has been described as "the Japanese [[National epic|epic]]", and the twentieth-century novelist and essayist [[Kafū Nagai]] called it "a unique and immortal Japanese ''épopée''."&lt;ref name="heike rep"&gt;Keene 1999 : 637; Keene 1998 : 415.&lt;/ref&gt; These works were at least partly indebted to earlier Heian works such as the ''[[Shōmonki]]'' ([[:ja:将門記]]) and ''[[Mutsu Waki]]'' ([[:ja:陸奥話記]]), bare historical chronicles of battles fought against [[Taira no Masakado]] and the [[Earlier Nine Years' War]], narrated in a non-literary style of [[kanbun|classical Chinese]] as opposed to the mixed Sino-Japanese vernacular of the later Kamakura works.&lt;ref name=senki&gt;Keene 1999 : 613–615.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muromachi period (1333–1568)===
{{Main|Muromachi period|Sengoku period|Higashiyama period}}
[[File:Ashikaga Takauji.JPG|thumb|Portrait of [[Ashikaga Takauji]] who was the founder and first ''[[shōgun]]'' of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]]]]
Takauji and many other samurai soon became dissatisfied with Emperor Go-Daigo's [[Kenmu Restoration]], an ambitious attempt to monopolize power in the imperial court. Takauji rebelled after Go-Daigo refused to appoint him shogun. In 1338, Takauji captured Kyoto and installed a rival member of the imperial family to the throne, [[Emperor Kōmyō]], who did appoint him shogun.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Go-Daigo responded by fleeing to the southern city of [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]], where he set up a rival government. This ushered in a prolonged period of conflict between the Northern Court and the Southern Court.&lt;ref name="muromachi"&gt;Henshall, 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takauji set up his shogunate in the Muromachi district of Kyoto. However, the shogunate was faced with the twin challenges of fighting the Southern Court and of maintaining its authority over its own subordinate governors.&lt;ref name="muromachi"/&gt; Like the Kamakura shogunate, the Muromachi shogunate appointed its allies to rule in the provinces, but these men increasingly styled themselves as feudal lords—called ''[[daimyō]]s''—of their domains and often refused to obey the shogun.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ashikaga shogun who was most successful at bringing the country together was Takauji's grandson [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]], who came to power in 1368 and remained influential until his death in 1408. Yoshimitsu expanded the power of the shogunate and in 1392, brokered a deal to bring the Northern and Southern Courts together and end the civil war. Henceforth, the shogunate kept the Emperor and his court under tight control.&lt;ref name="muromachi"/&gt;

[[File:Map Japan Genki1-en.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the territories of major ''daimyō'' families around 1570 CE]]
During the final century of the Ashikaga shogunate the country descended into another, more violent period of civil war. This started in 1467 when the [[Ōnin War]] broke out over who would succeed the ruling shogun. The ''daimyōs'' each took sides and burned Kyoto to the ground while battling for their preferred candidate. By the time the succession was settled in 1477, the shogun had lost all power over the ''daimyō'', who now ruled hundreds of independent states throughout Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt; During this [[Sengoku period|Warring States period]], ''daimyōs'' fought among themselves for control of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most powerful ''daimyōs'' of the era were [[Uesugi Kenshin]], [[Takeda Shingen]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Turnbull and Richard Hook, ''Samurai Commanders (1)'' (Oxford: Osprey, 2005), 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Date Masamune]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Turnbull and Richard Hook, ''Samurai Commanders (2)'' (Oxford: Osprey, 2005), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; One enduring symbol of this era was the [[ninja]], skilled spies and assassins hired by ''daimyōs''. Few definite historical facts are known about the secretive lifestyles of the ninja, who became the subject of many legends.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Perez, "Ninja," in ''Japan at War : An Encyclopedia'', ed. Louis Perez (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2013), 277–278.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ''daimyōs'', rebellious peasants and "warrior monks" affiliated with Buddhist temples also raised their own armies.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 39, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Japanese Crest Uesugi Sasa.svg|thumb|Crest used by the ''daimyō'' [[Uesugi Kenshin]]]]
Amid this on-going anarchy, a Chinese ship was blown off course and landed in 1543 on the Japanese island of [[Tanegashima]], just south of Kyushu. The three [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]] traders on board were [[António Mota]], Francisco Zeimoto, and presumably [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]]. They were the first Europeans to set foot in Japan.&lt;ref name="Europeans"&gt;Henshall, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon [[Nanban trade|European traders]] would introduce many new items to Japan, most importantly the [[musket]].&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1556, the ''daimyōs'' were already using about 300,000 muskets in their armies.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans also [[History of Roman Catholicism in Japan|brought Christianity]], which soon came to have a substantial following in Japan. The [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Francis Xavier]] disembarked in Kyushu in 1549.&lt;ref name="Europeans"/&gt;

====Muromachi culture====
In spite of the war, Japan's relative economic prosperity, which had begun in the Kamakura period, continued well into the Muromachi period. By 1450 Japan's population stood at ten million, compared to six million at the end of the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="population"&gt;Farris, 141–142, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Commerce flourished, including considerable trade with China and Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''daimyōs'' and other groups within Japan were minting their own coins, Japan began to transition from a barter-based to a currency-based economy.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, some of Japan's most representative art forms developed, including [[ink wash painting]], ''[[ikebana]]'' flower arrangement, the [[tea ceremony]], [[Japanese garden]]ing, ''[[bonsai]]'', and ''[[Noh]]'' theater.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the eighth Ashikaga shogun, [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa|Yoshimasa]], was an ineffectual political and military leader, he played a critical role in promoting these cultural developments.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bolitho, "Book Review: Yoshimasa and the Silver Pavilion," ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', August 2004, 799–800.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600)===
{{Main|Azuchi–Momoyama period}}
[[File:Sekigahara Kassen Byōbu-zu (Gifu History Museum).jpg|thumb|800px|center|&lt;center&gt;[[Edo period|Edo-period]] screen depicting the [[Battle of Sekigahara]]. It began on 21 October 1600 with a total of 160,000 men facing each other.&lt;/center&gt;]]
During the second half of the [[17th century]], Japan gradually reunified under two powerful warlords: [[Oda Nobunaga]]; and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The period takes its name from Nobunaga's headquarters, [[Azuchi Castle]], and Hideyoshi's headquarters, [[Momoyama Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan Volume One'' (New York: Kodansha, 1983), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Azuchimomoyama-japan.png|thumb|alt=|Japan in 1582, showing territory conquered by Oda Nobunaga in grey]]
Nobunaga was the ''daimyō'' of the small province of [[Owari Province|Owari]]. He burst onto the scene suddenly, in 1560, when, during the [[Battle of Okehazama]], his army defeated a force several times its size led by the powerful ''daimyō'' [[Imagawa Yoshimoto]].&lt;ref name="azuchi"&gt;Henshall, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobunaga was renowned for his strategic leadership and his ruthlessness. He encouraged Christianity to incite hatred toward his Buddhist enemies and to forge strong relationships with European arms merchants. He equipped his armies with muskets and trained them with innovative tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted talented men regardless of their social status, including his peasant servant Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who became one of his best generals.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, 141–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Azuchi–Momoyama period began in 1568, when Nobunaga seized Kyoto and thus effectively brought an end to the Ashikaga shogunate.&lt;ref name="azuchi"/&gt; He was well on his way towards his goal of reuniting all Japan in 1582 when one of his own officers, [[Akechi Mitsuhide]], killed him during an abrupt attack on his encampment. Hideyoshi avenged Nobunaga by crushing Akechi's uprising and emerged as Nobunaga's successor.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Hideyoshi completed the reunification of Japan by conquering [[Shikoku]], [[Kyushu]], and the lands of the [[Late Hōjō clan|Hōjō family]] in eastern Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; He launched sweeping changes to Japanese society, including the confiscation of swords from the peasantry, new restrictions on ''daimyōs'', persecutions of Christians, a thorough land survey, and a new law effectively forbidding the peasants and samurai from changing their social class.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Hideyoshi's land survey designated all those who were cultivating the land as being "commoners", an act which effectively granted freedom to most of Japan's [[Slavery in Japan|slaves]].&lt;ref name="Farris, 193"&gt;Farris, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hideyoshi's power expanded he dreamed of conquering China and launched two massive [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|invasions of Korea]] starting in 1592. Hideyoshi failed to defeat the Chinese and Korean armies on the Korean Peninsula and the war ended only after his death in 1598.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

In the hope of founding a new dynasty, Hideyoshi had asked his most trusted subordinates to pledge loyalty to his infant son [[Toyotomi Hideyori]]. Despite this, almost immediately after Hideyoshi's death, war broke out between Hideyori's allies and those loyal to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], a ''daimyō'' and a former ally of Hideyoshi.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Tokugawa Ieyasu won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, ushering in 268 uninterrupted years of rule by the [[Tokugawa clan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hane, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edo period (1600–1868)===
{{Main|Edo period}}
[[File:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|alt=|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was the founder and first ''[[shōgun]]'' of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].]]
The Edo period was characterized by relative peace and stability&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; under the tight control of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which ruled from the eastern city of [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo).&lt;ref name="city"&gt;Henshall, 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1603, [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]] declared Tokugawa Ieyasu ''[[shōgun]]'', and Ieyasu abdicated two years later to groom his son as the second ''shōgun'' of what became a long dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it took time for the Tokugawas to consolidate their rule. In 1609, the ''shōgun'' gave the ''daimyō'' of [[Satsuma Domain]] permission to [[Invasion of Ryukyu|invade]] the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] for perceived insults towards the shogunate; the Satsuma victory began 266 years of Ryukyu's dual subordination to Satsuma and China.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen. ''The Samurai Capture a King: Okinawa 1609''. Osprey Publishing, 2009. Pp 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 162–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Ieyasu led the [[Siege of Osaka]] that ended with the destruction of the [[Toyotomi clan]] in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the shogunate promulgated the [[Laws for the Military Houses]], which imposed tighter controls on the ''daimyōs'',&lt;ref&gt;McClain, 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sankin-kōtai|alternate attendance system]], which required each ''daimyō'' to spend every other year in Edo.&lt;ref name="tokugawa"&gt;Henshall, 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the ''daimyōs'' continued to maintain a significant degree of autonomy in their domains.&lt;ref name="edo"&gt;Perez, 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; The central government of the shogunate in Edo, which quickly became the most populous city in the world,&lt;ref name="city"/&gt; took counsel from a group of senior advisors known as ''[[rōjū]]'' and employed samurai as bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 308.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor in Kyoto was funded lavishly by the government but was allowed no political power.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tokugawa family crest.svg|thumb|upright|left|alt=|Crest of the Tokugawa family]]
The Tokugawa shogunate went to great lengths to suppress social unrest. Harsh penalties, including crucifixion, beheading, and death by boiling, were decreed for even the most minor offenses, though criminals of high social class were often given the option of ''[[seppuku]]'' ("self-disembowelment"), an ancient form of suicide that now became ritualized.&lt;ref name="tokugawa"/&gt; Christianity, which was seen as a potential threat, was gradually clamped down on until finally, after the Christian-led [[Shimabara Rebellion]] of 1638, the religion was completely outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent further foreign ideas from sowing dissent, the third Tokugawa shogun, [[Iemitsu]], implemented the ''[[sakoku]]'' ("closed country") isolationist policy under which Japanese people were not allowed to travel abroad, return from overseas, or build ocean-going vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Chaiklin, "Sakoku (1633–1854)", in ''Japan at War: An Encyclopedia'', ed. Louis Perez (Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2013), 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt; The only Europeans allowed on Japanese soil were the Dutch, who were granted a single trading post on the island of [[Dejima]]. China and Korea were the only other countries permitted to trade,&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and many foreign books were banned from import.&lt;ref name="edo"/&gt;

During the first century of Tokugawa rule, Japan's population doubled to thirty million, due in large part to agricultural growth; the population remained stable for the rest of the period.&lt;ref name="agriculture"&gt;Totman, 317, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; The shogunate's construction of roads, elimination of road and bridge tolls, and standardization of coinage promoted commercial expansion that also benefited the merchants and artisans of the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 319–320, 322.&lt;/ref&gt; City populations grew,&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; but almost ninety percent of the population continued to live in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the inhabitants of cities and of rural communities would benefit from one of the most notable social changes of the Edo period: increased literacy and numeracy. The number of private schools greatly expanded, particularly those attached to temples and shrines, and raised literacy to thirty percent. This may have been the world's highest rate at the time&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and drove a flourishing commercial publishing industry, which grew to produce hundreds of titles per year.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of numeracy&amp;nbsp;– approximated by an index measuring people's ability to report an exact rather than a rounded age (age-heaping method), and which level shows a strong correlation to later economic development of a country&amp;nbsp;– Japan's level was comparable to that of north-west European countries, and moreover, Japan's index came close to the 100 percent mark throughout the nineteenth century. These high levels of both literacy and numeracy were part of the socio-economical foundation for Japan’s strong growth rates during the following century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

====Culture and philosophy====
[[File: Ｓａｍｕｒａｉ.jpg|thumb|Samurais could [[Kiri-sute gomen|kill a commoner]] for the slightest insult and were widely feared by the Japanese population. [[Edo period]], 1798.]]
The Edo period was a time of prolific cultural output. [[Haiku]], whose greatest master is generally considered [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644–94),&lt;ref&gt;Hane, 213–214&lt;/ref&gt; rose as a major form of poetry. Forms of theatre developed, such as the flamboyant [[kabuki]] drama and ''[[bunraku]]'' puppet theatre, the latter of which reached its height of through the plays of [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653–1725).&lt;ref&gt;Hane, 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the wealthy merchant class who patronized this poetry and theater were said to live hedonistic lives, which came to be called ''[[ukiyo]]'' ("floating world").&lt;ref&gt;Hane, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; They often paid for the services of [[Oiran|courtesans]] and [[geisha]] entertainers, most of whom also served as prostitutes in [[Yūkaku|designated red-light districts]] such as [[Yoshiwara]] in Edo.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This lifestyle inspired ''[[ukiyo-zōshi]]'' popular novels and ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' art, the latter of which were often woodblock prints&lt;ref&gt;Hane, 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt; that progressed to greater sophistication and use of [[Nishiki-e|multiple printed colors]].&lt;ref&gt;Deal, 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decline and fall of the shogunate====
{{Main|Bakumatsu|Meiji Restoration}}
By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the shogunate showed signs of weakening.&lt;ref name="bakumatsu"&gt;Henshall, 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic growth of agriculture that had characterized the early Edo period had ended&lt;ref name="agriculture"/&gt; and the government handled the devastating [[Tenpō famine]]s poorly.&lt;ref name="bakumatsu"/&gt; Peasant unrest grew and government revenues fell.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 367–369.&lt;/ref&gt; The shogunate cut the pay of the already financially distressed samurai, many of whom worked side jobs to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;McClain, 123–124, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Discontented samurai were soon to play a major role in engineering the downfall of the Tokugawa shogunate.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the people drew inspiration from new ideas and fields of study. Dutch books brought into Japan stimulated interest in Western learning, called ''[[rangaku]]'' or "Dutch learning".&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The physician [[Sugita Genpaku]], for instance, used concepts from Western medicine to help spark a revolution in Japanese ideas of human anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 149–151.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholarly field of ''[[kokugaku]]'' or "National Learning", developed by scholars such as [[Motoori Norinaga]] and [[Hirata Atsutane]], promoted what it asserted were native Japanese values. For instance, it criticized the Chinese-style Neo-Confucianism advocated by the shogunate and emphasized the Emperor's divine authority, which the Shinto faith taught had its roots in Japan's mythic past, which was referred to as the "[[Age of the Gods]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hane, 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Satsuma-samurai-during-boshin-war-period.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Samurai of the Satsuma Domain during the Boshin War]]
The arrival in 1853 of a fleet of American ships commanded by Commodore [[Matthew&amp;nbsp;C. Perry]] threw Japan into turmoil. The US government aimed to end Japan's isolationist policies. The shogunate had no defense against Perry's gunboats and had to agree to his demands that American ships be permitted to acquire provisions and trade at Japanese ports.&lt;ref name="bakumatsu"/&gt; The US, Great Britain, Russia, and other Western powers imposed what became known as "[[unequal treaties]]" on Japan which stipulated that Japan must allow citizens of these countries to visit or reside on Japanese territory and must not levy tariffs on their imports or try them in Japanese courts.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shogunate's failure to oppose the Western powers angered many Japanese, particularly those of the southern domains of [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]] and [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Many samurai there, inspired by the nationalist doctrines of the kokugaku school, adopted the slogan of ''[[sonnō jōi]]'' ("revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians").&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 380, 382.&lt;/ref&gt; The two domains then went on to form an alliance. In August 1866, soon after becoming shogun, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], struggled to maintain power as civil unrest continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|pp=55–56.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1867, Yoshinobu officially tendered his resignation to the Emperor and he formally stepped down ten days later.&lt;ref&gt;Takano, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chōshū and Satsuma domains in 1868 convinced the young [[Emperor Meiji]] and his advisors to issue a [[rescript]] calling for an end to the Tokugawa shogunate. The armies of Chōshū and Satsuma soon marched on Edo and the ensuing [[Boshin War]] led to the eventual fall of the shogunate.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 71, 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meiji period (1868–1912)===
{{Main|Meiji period|Foreign relations of Meiji Japan}}
[[File:Meiji tenno1.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Emperor Meiji]], the 122nd [[Emperor of Japan]]]]
The Emperor was restored to nominal supreme power,&lt;ref name="rulers"&gt;Henshall, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1869, the imperial family moved to Edo, which was renamed [[Tokyo]] ("eastern capital").&lt;ref name="capital"&gt;Henshall, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most powerful men in the government were former samurai from Chōshū and Satsuma rather than the Emperor, who was fifteen in 1868.&lt;ref name="rulers"/&gt; These men, known as the [[Meiji oligarchy|Meiji oligarchs]], oversaw the dramatic changes Japan would experience during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Morton and Olenike, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the [[Meiji government]], who are regarded as some of the most successful statesmen in human history,&lt;ref&gt;Weston, 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; desired Japan to become a modern nation-state that could stand equal to the Western imperialist powers.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 75–76, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were [[Ōkubo Toshimichi]] and [[Saigō Takamori]] from Satsuma, as well as [[Kido Takayoshi]], Ito Hirobumi, and Yamagata Aritomo from Chōshū.&lt;ref name="rulers"/&gt;

====Political and social changes====
The [[Meiji government]] abolished the Neo-Confucian class structure&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;Henshall, 79–89.&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced the feudal domains of the ''daimyōs'' with [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]].&lt;ref name="capital"/&gt; It instituted comprehensive tax reform&lt;ref name="reform"/&gt; and lifted the ban on Christianity. Major government priorities included the introduction of railways,&lt;ref&gt;W. Dean Kinzley, "Merging Lines: Organising Japan's National Railroad, 1906–1914", ''Journal of Transport History'', 27#2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; telegraph lines, and a universal education system.

The Meiji government promoted widespread [[Westernization]]&lt;ref name="western"&gt;Totman, 401.&lt;/ref&gt; and hired hundreds of [[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan|advisers from Western nations]] with expertise in such fields as education, mining, banking, law, military affairs, and transportation to remodel Japan's institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]], Western clothing, and Western hairstyles.&lt;ref name="west"&gt;Henshall, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; One leading advocate of Westernization was the popular writer [[Fukuzawa Yukichi]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its Westernization drive, the Meiji government enthusiastically sponsored the importation of Western science, above all medical science. In 1893, [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] established the Institute for Infectious Diseases, which would soon become world-famous,&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 460–461.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1913, [[Hideyo Noguchi]] proved the link between [[syphilis]] and [[paresis]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauerman, 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the introduction of European literary styles to Japan sparked a boom in new works of prose fiction. Characteristic authors of the period included [[Futabatei Shimei]] and [[Mori Ōgai]],&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 464–465.&lt;/ref&gt; although the most famous of the Meiji era writers was [[Natsume Sōseki]],&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote satirical, autobiographical, and psychological novels&lt;ref&gt;Weston, 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; combining both the older and newer styles.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 466.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ichiyō Higuchi]], a leading female author, took inspiration from earlier literary models of the Edo period.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Caiger, 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government institutions developed rapidly in response to the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]], a grassroots campaign demanding greater popular participation in politics. The leaders of this movement included [[Itagaki Taisuke]] and [[Ōkuma Shigenobu]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 85–92.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Itō Hirobumi]], the first [[Prime Minister of Japan]], responded by writing the [[Meiji Constitution]], which was promulgated in 1889. The new constitution established an elected lower house, the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]], but its powers were restricted. Only two percent of the population were eligible to vote, and legislation proposed in the House required the support of the unelected upper house, the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]]. Both the cabinet of Japan and the Japanese military were directly responsible not to the elected legislature but to the Emperor. Concurrently, the Japanese government also developed a form of [[Japanese nationalism]] under which [[State Shinto|Shinto became the state religion]] and the Emperor was declared a living god.&lt;ref&gt;Bix, 27, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools nationwide instilled patriotic values and loyalty to the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;F.H. Hinsley, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 11: Material Progress and World-Wide Problems, 1870–98'' (1962) [http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/toc/z2010_334.pdf contents] pp 464–86&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rise of imperialism and the military====
{{Further|History of Japanese foreign relations|Military history of Japan}}
[[File:Generals Pyongyang MigitaToshihide October1894.jpg|thumb|800px|center|&lt;center&gt;Chinese generals surrendering to the Japanese in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–1895&lt;/center&gt;]]
In December 1871, a Ryukyuan ship was shipwrecked on Taiwan and the crew [[Mudan incident|were massacred]]. In 1874, using the incident as a pretext, Japan launched [[Taiwan expedition of 1874|a military expedition]] to Taiwan to assert their claims to the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. The expedition featured the first instance of the Japanese military ignoring the orders of the civilian government, as the expedition set sail after being ordered to postpone.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 356–360.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yamagata Aritomo]], who was born a samurai in the Chōshū Domain, was a key force behind the modernization and enlargement of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], especially the introduction of national conscription.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The new army was put to use in 1877 to crush the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] of discontented samurai in southern Japan led by the former Meiji leader Saigo Takamori.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese military played a key role in Japan's expansion abroad. The government believed that Japan had to acquire its own colonies to compete with the Western colonial powers. After consolidating its control over [[Hokkaido]] and annexing the Ryukyu Kingdom, it next turned its attention to China and Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 422–424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, Japanese and Chinese troops clashed in Korea, where they were both stationed to suppress the [[Donghak Rebellion]]. During the ensuing [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan's highly motivated and well-led forces defeated the more numerous and better-equipped military of [[Qing China]].&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; The island of Taiwan was thus ceded to Japan in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan's government gained enough international prestige to allow Foreign Minister [[Mutsu Munemitsu]] to renegotiate the "unequal treaties".&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 115, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 Japan signed [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|an important military alliance]] with the British.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pacific Area - The Imperial Powers 1939 - Map.svg|thumb|The [[Japanese Empire]] in 1939]]
Japan next clashed with Russia, which was expanding its power in Asia. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–05 ended with the dramatic [[Battle of Tsushima]], which was another victory for Japan's military. Japan thus laid claim to Korea [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905|as a protectorate]] in 1905, followed by [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|full annexation in 1910]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic modernization and labor unrest====
During the Meiji period, Japan underwent a rapid transition towards an industrial economy.&lt;ref name="industry"/&gt; Both the Japanese government and private entrepreneurs adopted Western technology and knowledge to create factories capable of producing a wide range of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the period, the majority of Japan's exports were manufactured goods.&lt;ref name="industry"&gt;Henshall, 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Japan's most successful new businesses and industries constituted huge family-owned conglomerates called ''[[zaibatsu]]'', such as [[Mitsubishi]] and [[Sumitomo]].&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenal industrial growth sparked rapid urbanization. The proportion of the population working in agriculture shrank from 75 percent in 1872 to 50 percent by 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan enjoyed solid economic growth at this time and most people lived longer and healthier lives. The population rose from 34 million in 1872 to 52 million in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 403–404, 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Poor working conditions in factories led to growing labor unrest,&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 440–442.&lt;/ref&gt; and many workers and intellectuals came to embrace socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 452–453.&lt;/ref&gt; The Meiji government responded with harsh suppression of dissent. Radical socialists plotted to assassinate the Emperor in the [[High Treason Incident]] of 1910, after which the [[Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu|Tokkō]] secret police force was established to root out left-wing agitators.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The government also introduced social legislation in 1911 setting maximum work hours and a minimum age for employment.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communications became a high priority for businesses, government agencies and upscale consumers. They quickly adopted the telegraph. the telephone, phonograph, and radio.&lt;ref&gt;Kerim Yasar, ''Electrified Voices: How the Telephone, Phonograph, and Radio Shaped Modern Japan, 1868–1945'' (2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taishō period (1912–1926)===
{{Main|Taishō period}}
During the short reign of [[Emperor Taishō]] Japan developed stronger democratic institutions and grew in international power. The [[Taishō political crisis]] opened the period with mass protests and riots organized by Japanese political parties, which succeeded in forcing [[Katsura Tarō]] to resign as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; This and the [[rice riots of 1918]] increased the power of Japan's political parties over the ruling oligarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seiyūkai]] and [[Rikken Minseitō|Minseitō]] parties came to dominate politics by the end of the so-called "Taishō democracy" era.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 179, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise for the House of Representatives had been gradually expanded since 1890,&lt;ref&gt;Large, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1925 [[universal male suffrage]] was introduced. However, in the same year the far-reaching [[Peace Preservation Law]] also passed, prescribing harsh penalties for political dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japan during World War I|Japan's participation in World War&amp;nbsp;I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] sparked unprecedented economic growth and earned Japan [[Nanyo (Japanese mandated territory)|new colonies in the South Pacific]] seized from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 471, 488–489.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war Japan signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and enjoyed good international relations through its membership in the [[League of Nations]] and participation in international disarmament conferences.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] in September 1923 left over 100,000 dead, and combined with the resultant fires destroyed the homes of more than three million.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of popular prose fiction, which began during the Meiji period, continued into the Taishō period as literacy rates rose and book prices dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 520.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable literary figures of the era included short story writer [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 525.&lt;/ref&gt; and the novelist [[Haruo Satō (novelist)|Haruo Satō]]. [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]], described as "perhaps the most versatile literary figure of his day" by the historian Conrad Totman, produced many works during the Taishō period influenced by European literature, though his 1929 novel ''[[Some Prefer Nettles]]'' reflects deep appreciation for the virtues of traditional Japanese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 522–523.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Taishō period, Tarō Hirai, known by his penname [[Edogawa Ranpo]], began writing popular mystery and crime stories.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 524.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shōwa period (1926–1989)===
{{Main|Shōwa period|History of Japanese foreign relations}}
Emperor [[Hirohito]]'s sixty-three-year reign from 1926 to 1989 is the longest in recorded Japanese history.&lt;ref name="showa"&gt;Totman, 583.&lt;/ref&gt; The first twenty years were characterized by the rise of extreme nationalism and a series of expansionist wars. After suffering defeat in World War&amp;nbsp;II, Japan was occupied by foreign powers for the first time in its history, and then re-emerged as a major world economic power.

====Manchurian Incident and the Second Sino-Japanese War====
[[File:1937 Japan VP8.webm|thumb|alt=|The Empire of Japan in 1937]]
[[File:Mantetsu Honsha.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of South Manchuria Railway, [[Dalian]], c. 1940]]

Left-wing groups had been subject to violent suppression by the end of the Taishō period,&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; and radical right-wing groups, inspired by fascism and Japanese nationalism, rapidly grew in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme right became influential throughout the Japanese government and society, notably within the [[Kwantung Army]], a Japanese army stationed in China along the Japanese-owned [[South Manchuria Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, radical army officers bombed a small portion of the South Manchuria Railroad and, falsely attributing the attack to the Chinese, invaded Manchuria. The Kwantung Army conquered Manchuria and set up the puppet government of [[Manchukuo]] there without permission from the Japanese government. International criticism of Japan following the invasion led to Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations.&lt;ref name="Henshall 114 115"&gt;Henshall, 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Tsuyoshi Inukai]] of the Seiyūkai Party attempted to restrain the Kwantung Army and was assassinated in 1932 by right-wing extremists. Because of growing opposition within the Japanese military and the extreme right to party politicians, who they saw as corrupt and self-serving, Inukai was the last party politician to govern Japan in the pre-World War&amp;nbsp;II era.&lt;ref name="Henshall 114 115"/&gt; In February 1936 young radical officers of the Imperial Japanese Army [[February 26 Incident|attempted a coup d'état]]. They assassinated many moderate politicians before the coup was suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; In its wake the Japanese military consolidated its control over the political system and most political parties were abolished when the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] was founded in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;McClain, 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:193109 mukden incident railway sabotage.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese experts inspect the scene of the 'railway sabotage' on South Manchurian Railway, leading to the Mukden Incident and the Japanese occupation of Manchuria.]]

Japan's expansionist vision grew increasingly bold. Many of Japan's political elite aspired to have Japan acquire new territory for resource extraction and settlement of surplus population.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; These ambitions led to the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. After [[Battle of Nanjing|their victory]] in [[Nanjing|the Chinese capital]], the Japanese military committed the infamous [[Nanjing Massacre]]. The Japanese military failed to defeat the Chinese government led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the war descended into a bloody stalemate that lasted until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's stated war aim was to establish the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], a vast [[pan-Asian]] union under Japanese domination.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; Hirohito's role in Japan's foreign wars remains a subject of controversy, with various historians portraying him as either a powerless figurehead or an enabler and supporter of Japanese militarism.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, 201–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States opposed Japan's invasion of China and responded with increasingly stringent economic sanctions intended to deprive Japan of the resources to continue its war in China.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 553–554.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan reacted by forging an alliance with Germany and Italy in 1940, known as the [[Tripartite Pact]], which worsened its relations with the US. In July 1941, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands froze all Japanese assets when Japan completed its [[invasion of French Indochina]] by occupying the southern half of the country, further increasing tension in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 555–556.&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War II====
{{Main|Pacific War}}
[[File:Carrier shokaku.jpg|thumb|Planes from the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shōkaku|Japanese aircraft carrier ''Shōkaku'']] preparing the attack on Pearl Harbor]]
In late 1941, Japan's government, led by Prime Minister and General [[Hideki Tojo]], decided to break the US-led embargo through force of arms.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|a surprise attack]] on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This brought the US into [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Japan then successfully invaded the Asian colonies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, including the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], and the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early stages of the war, Japan scored victory after victory. The tide began to turn against Japan following the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942 and the subsequent [[Battle of Guadalcanal]], in which Allied troops wrested the [[Solomon Islands]] from Japanese control.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the Japanese military was responsible for such war crimes as mistreatment of prisoners of war, massacres of civilians, and the use of chemical and biological weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 131–132, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese military earned a reputation for fanaticism, often employing [[banzai charge]]s and fighting almost to the last man against overwhelming odds.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 the Imperial Japanese Navy began deploying squadrons of ''[[kamikaze]]'' pilots who crashed their planes into enemy ships.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Atomic cloud over Hiroshima, 1945]]
Life in Japan became increasingly difficult for civilians due to stringent rationing of food, electrical outages, and a brutal crackdown on dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 the US Army captured the island of [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], which allowed the United States to begin widespread [[Air raids on Japan|bombing raids on the Japanese mainland]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton and Olenike, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; These destroyed over half of the total area of Japan's major cities.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 562.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Okinawa]], fought between April and June 1945, was the largest naval operation of the war and left 77,166 Japanese soldiers and more than 140,000 Okinawans dead, suggesting that the planned [[Operation Downfall|invasion of mainland Japan]] would be even bloodier.&lt;ref name="www3.pref.okinawa.jp"&gt;"The Cornerstone of Peace."

However, on August 6, 1945, the US dropped an atomic bomb [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|over Hiroshima]], killing over 90,000 people. This was the first nuclear attack in history. On August 9 the [[Soviet Union]] declared war on Japan and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchukuo]], and Nagasaki was struck by [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Nagasaki|a second atomic bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; The unconditional [[surrender of Japan]] was announced by Emperor Hirohito and communicated to the Allies on August 14, and [[Gyokuon-hōsō|broadcast]] on national radio on the following day, marking the end of Imperial Japan's ultranationalist ideology, and was a major turning point in Japanese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/08/the-Emperors-speech-67-years-ago-hirohito-transformed-japan-forever/261166/|title=The Emperor's Speech: 67 Years Ago, Hirohito Transformed Japan Forever|work=The Atlantic|author=Max Fisher|date=15 August 2012|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occupation of Japan====
{{Main|Occupation of Japan}}
[[File:macarthur hirohito.jpg|thumb|alt=|General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Hirohito]], at their first meeting, September 1945]]
Japan experienced dramatic political and social transformation under the Allied occupation in 1945–1952. US General [[Douglas MacArthur]], the [[Supreme Commander of Allied Powers]], served as Japan's ''de facto'' leader and played a central role in implementing reforms, many inspired by the [[New Deal]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Release of Communist.JPG|thumb|left|The Japanese government releases members of the [[Japan Communist Party]] on October 10, 1945.]]
The occupation sought to decentralize power in Japan by breaking up the ''[[zaibatsu]]'', transferring ownership of agricultural land from landlords to tenant farmers,&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; and promoting labor unionism.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major goals were the demilitarization and democratization of Japan's government and society. Japan's military was disarmed,&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese colonial empire|its colonies]] were granted independence,&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 570.&lt;/ref&gt; the Peace Preservation Law and Tokkō were abolished,&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Military Tribunal of the Far East]] tried war criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cabinet of Japan|cabinet]] became responsible not to the Emperor but to the elected [[National Diet]].&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 571.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor was permitted to remain on the throne, but was ordered to [[Humanity Declaration|renounce his claims to divinity]], which had been a pillar of the State Shinto system.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's [[Constitution of Japan|new constitution]] came into effect in 1947 and guaranteed civil liberties, labor rights, and women's suffrage,&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; and through [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]], Japan renounced its right to go to war with another nation.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] of 1951 officially normalized relations between Japan and the United States. The occupation ended in 1952, although the US continued to [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|administer a number of the Ryukyu Islands]],&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; [[1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement|with Okinawa]] being the last to be returned in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Thomas.

====Postwar growth and prosperity====
{{Main|Post-occupation Japan|Japanese post-war economic miracle}}
[[File:Shigeru Yoshida suit.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=|[[Shigeru Yoshida]] was a Japanese [[diplomat]] and politician who served as [[Prime Minister of Japan]] from 1946 to 1947 and from 1948 to 1954, becoming one of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Japan#Rank by tenure|longest serving PMs in Japanese history]] as the second-longest serving Prime Minister in [[post-occupation Japan]].]]
[[Shigeru Yoshida]] served as prime minister in 1946–47 and 1948–54, and played a key role in guiding Japan through the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 156–157, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; His policies, known as the [[Yoshida Doctrine]], proposed that Japan should forge a tight relationship with the United States and focus on developing the economy rather than pursuing a proactive foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshida's [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]] merged in 1955 into the new [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP),&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; which went on to dominate Japanese politics for the remainder of the Shōwa period.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Japanese economy was in bad shape in the immediate postwar years, an austerity program implemented in 1949 by finance expert [[Joseph Dodge]] ended inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Korean War]] (1950–53) was a major boon to Japanese business.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 the Yoshida cabinet created the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] (MITI) with a mission to promote economic growth through close cooperation between the government and big business. MITI sought successfully to promote manufacturing and heavy industry,&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; and encourage exports.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The factors behind Japan's postwar economic growth included technology and quality control techniques imported from the West, close economic and defense cooperation with the United States, non-tariff barriers to imports, restrictions on labor unionization, long work hours, and a generally favorable global economic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese corporations successfully retained a loyal and experienced workforce through the system of [[Shūshin koyō|lifetime employment]], which assured their employees a safe job.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 162, 166, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Treaty of peace with japan.jpg|thumb|left|US Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] signing the [[Treaty of San Francisco|Treaty of Peace with Japan]], September 8, 1951]]
By 1955, the Japanese economy had grown beyond prewar levels,&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 576.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1968 it had become the second largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/14/china-second-largest-economy |title=China overtakes Japan as world's second-largest economy|author1=Justin McCurry |author2=Julia Kollewe |work=The Guardian|date=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gross national product|GNP]] expanded at an annual rate of nearly 10% from 1956 until the [[1973 oil crisis]] slowed growth to a still-rapid average annual rate of just over 4% until 1991.{{sfn|Gao|2009|p=303}} Life expectancy rose and Japan's population increased to 123 million by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 584–585.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary Japanese people became wealthy enough to purchase a wide array of consumer goods. During this period, Japan became the world's largest manufacturer of automobiles and a leading producer of electronics.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan signed the [[Plaza Accord]] in 1985 to depreciate the US dollar against the yen and other currencies. By the end of 1987, the [[Nikkei 225|Nikkei]] stock market index had doubled and the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] became the largest in the world. During [[Japanese asset price bubble|the ensuing economic bubble]], stock and real-estate loans grew rapidly.{{sfn|Gao|2009|p=305}}

Japan became a member of the [[United Nations]] in 1956 and further cemented its international standing in 1964, when it hosted the [[1964 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was a close ally of the United States during the [[Cold War]], though this alliance did not have unanimous support from the Japanese people. As requested by the United States, Japan reconstituted its army in 1954 under the name [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF), though some Japanese insisted that the very existence of the JSDF was a violation of Article 9 of Japan's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Ito, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, hundreds of thousands protested against amendments to the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|US-Japan Security Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 580–581.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan successfully normalized relations [[Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956|with the Soviet Union]] in 1956, despite [[Kuril Islands dispute|an ongoing dispute]] over the ownership of the [[Kuril Islands]],&lt;ref&gt;Togo, 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea|with South Korea]] in 1965, despite [[Liancourt Rocks dispute|an ongoing dispute]] over the ownership of the islands of [[Liancourt Rocks]].&lt;ref&gt;Togo, 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with US policy, Japan recognized the [[Republic of China]] on Taiwan as the legitimate government of China after World War&amp;nbsp;II, though Japan switched its recognition to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Togo, 126–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among cultural developments, the immediate post-occupation period became a golden age for [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;Perez, 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this include the abolition of government censorship, low film production costs, expanded access to new film techniques and technologies, and huge domestic audiences at a time when other forms of recreation were relatively scarce.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 669.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heisei period (1989–present)===
{{Main|Heisei period}}
Emperor [[Akihito]]'s reign began upon the death of his father, Emperor [[Hirohito]]. The economic bubble popped in 1989, and stock and land prices plunged as Japan entered a [[Deflation#In Japan|deflationary spiral]]. Banks found themselves saddled with insurmountable debts that hindered economic recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Stagnation worsened as the birthrate declined far below replacement level.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s are often referred to as Japan's [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic performance was frequently poor in the following decades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/17/japan-economy-estimate-idUSL4E8JH1TC20120817|title=Japan eyes end to decades long deflation|author=Leika Kihara|publisher=''Reuters''|date=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stock market never returned to its pre-1989 highs.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 678.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's system of lifetime employment largely collapsed and unemployment rates rose.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The faltering economy and several corruption scandals weakened the LDP's dominant political position. Japan was nevertheless governed by non-LDP prime ministers only in 1993–96&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2009–12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20745165|title=Japan election: Shinzo Abe and LDP in sweeping win – exit poll|publisher=BBC News|date=December 16, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's dealing with its war legacy has strained international relations. China and Korea have found official apologies, such as those of the Emperor in 1990 and the [[Murayama Statement]] of 1995, inadequate or insincere.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist politics have exacerbated this, such as [[Nanjing Massacre denial|denial of the Nanjing Massacre]] and other war crimes;&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 199–201.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese history textbook controversies|revisionist history textbooks]], which have provoked [[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations|protests in East Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt; and frequent visits by Japanese politicians to [[Yasukuni Shrine]], where convicted war criminals are enshrined.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; [[2015 Japanese military legislation|Legislation in 2015]] expanding the military's role overseas was criticized as a "war bill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Obe |first=Mitsuru |date=September 18, 2015 |title=Japan Parliament Approves Overseas Military Expansion |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-parliament-approves-abe-security-bills-1442596867 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shinchi Sta 20110404.jpg|thumb|alt=|Wreckage at a railway station destroyed during the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 earthquake and tsunami]]]]
In spite of Japan's economic difficulties, this period also saw [[Japanese popular culture]], including [[Video gaming in Japan|video games]], [[anime]], and [[manga]], become worldwide phenomena, especially among young people.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2011, [[List of earthquakes in Japan|one of the largest earthquakes recorded in Japan]] [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|occurred in the northeast]].{{sfn|Ugai|Yagi|Wakai|2012|p=140}} The resulting tsunami [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|damaged the nuclear facilities in Fukushima]], which experienced a nuclear meltdown and severe radiation leakage.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century there have been increasing reports on the prevalence of [[Celibacy|sexless]]ness among the Japanese, including its byproducts such as a decreasing population, the increasing popularity of sexbots&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jason. "Robotic Evolution." Sex Robots. Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, 2017. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[herbivore men]]'' phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Kawanishi, Yuko. Mental Health Challenges Facing Contemporary Japanese Society. Brill, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social conditions==
Social stratification in Japan became pronounced during the Yayoi period. Expanding trade and agriculture increased the wealth of society, which was increasingly monopolized by social elites.&lt;ref name="Henshall, 13"/&gt; By 600 AD, a class structure had developed which included court aristocrats, the families of local magnates, commoners, and slaves.&lt;ref name="social"&gt;Farris, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90% were commoners, who included farmers, merchants, and artisans.&lt;ref name="class"&gt;Farris, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late Heian period, the governing elite consisted of three classes. The traditional aristocracy shared power with Buddhist monks and samurai,&lt;ref name="class"/&gt; though the latter became increasingly dominant in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 152, 181.&lt;/ref&gt; These periods witnessed the rise of the merchant class, which diversified into a greater variety of specialized occupations.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 152, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women initially held social and political equality with men,&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; and archaeological evidence suggests a prehistorical preference for female rulers in western Japan. Female Emperors appear in recorded history until the [[Meiji Constitution]] declared strict male-only ascension in 1889.&lt;ref name="Tonomura, 352"&gt;Tonomura, 352.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Confucian-style patriarchy was first codified in the 7th–8th centuries with the ''[[ritsuryō]]'' system,&lt;ref&gt;Tonomura, 351.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced a patrilineal [[koseki|family register]] with a male head of household.&lt;ref&gt;Tonomura, 353–354.&lt;/ref&gt; Women until then had held important roles in government which thereafter gradually diminished, though even in the late Heian period women wielded considerable court influence.&lt;ref name="Tonomura, 352"/&gt; Marital customs and many laws governing private property remained gender neutral.&lt;ref&gt;Tonomura, 354–355.&lt;/ref&gt;

For reasons that are unclear to historians the status of women rapidly deteriorated from the fourteenth century and onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Women of all social classes lost the right to own and inherit property and were increasingly viewed as inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Hideyoshi's land survey of the 1590s further entrenched the status of men as dominant landholders.&lt;ref&gt;Tonomura, 360.&lt;/ref&gt; During the US occupation following World War II&amp;nbsp;, women gained legal equality with men,&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; but faced widespread workplace discrimination. A movement for women's rights led to the passage of an equal employment law in 1986, but by the 1990s women held only 10% of management positions.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, 614–615.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hideyoshi's land survey of the 1590s designated all who cultivated the land as commoners, an act which granted effective freedom to most of Japan's [[Slavery in Japan|slaves]].&lt;ref name="Farris, 193"/&gt;

[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|alt=|Social structure of the Edo period]]
The Tokugawa shogunate rigidified long-existent class divisions,{{sfn|Wakita|1991|p=123}} placing most of the population into [[Edo Neo-Confucianism|a Neo-Confucian]] hierarchy of [[four occupations]], with the ruling elite at the top, followed by the peasants who made up 80% of the population, then artisans, and merchants at the bottom.{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=390}} Court nobles,{{sfn|Henshall|2012|p=56}} clerics, outcasts, entertainers, and workers of the licensed quarters fell outside this structure.{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=391}} Different legal codes applied to different classes, marriage between classes was prohibited, and towns were subdivided into different class areas.{{sfn|Wakita|1991|p=123}} The social stratification had little bearing on economic conditions: many samurai lived in poverty{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=391}} and the wealth of the merchant class grew throughout the period as the commercial economy developed and urbanization grew.{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=392}} The Edo-era social power structure proved untenable and gave way following the Meiji Restoration to one in which commercial power played an increasingly significant political role.{{sfn|Neary|2009|p=393}}

Although all social classes were legally abolished at the start of the Meiji period,&lt;ref name="reform"/&gt; income inequality greatly increased.&lt;ref name="income"&gt;Moriguchi and Saez, 80, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; New economic class divisions were formed between capitalist business owners who formed the new middle class, small shopkeepers of the old middle class, the working class in factories, rural landlords, and tenant farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Neary, 397.&lt;/ref&gt; The great disparities of income between the classes dissipated during and after World War II, eventually declining to levels that were among the lowest in the industrialized world.&lt;ref name="income"/&gt; Some postwar surveys indicated that up to 90% of Japanese self-identified as being middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Duus, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Populations of workers in professions [[Kegare|considered unclean]], such as leatherworkers and those who handled the dead, developed in the 15th and 16th centuries into hereditary [[Outcast (person)|outcast]] communities.{{sfn|Neary|2003|p=269}} These people, later called ''[[burakumin]]'', fell outside the Edo-period class structure and suffered discrimination that lasted after the class system was abolished.{{sfn|Neary|2003|p=270}} Though activism has improved the social conditions of those from ''burakumin'' backgrounds, discrimination in employment and education lingered into the 21st century.{{sfn|Neary|2003|p=271}}

[[Image:Etno kafana u Boracu.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A village kafana in Borač, [[Šumadija District]], [[Serbia]].]]
'''Kafana''' (in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] {{IPA-sh|kafǎna|pron}}), '''kafene\kafeneja''' (in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]), '''kafeana''' (кафеана, in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]), '''kavana''' (in [[Croatian language|Croatian]], {{IPA-sh|kaʋǎna|IPA}}) are terms used in most [[Former Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav]] countries and [[Albania]] for a distinct type of local [[bistro]] which primarily serves [[alcoholic beverage]]s and [[coffee]], and often also [[meze|light snacks]] ("Meze")  and other food. Most kafanas feature live music performances.

The concept of a social gathering place for men to drink alcoholic beverages and coffee originated in [[Ottoman Empire]] and spread to [[Southeast Europe]] during Ottoman rule, further evolving into the contemporary kafana.

==Nomenclature and etymology==
This distinct type of establishment is known by several slightly differing names depending on country and language:

* [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: кафана (''kafana''), [[Plural|pl.]] кафане (''kafane'')
* [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: кафеана (''kafeana''), pl. кафеани (''kafeani'')
* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: kavana, pl. kavane
* [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: kafana pl. kafane
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]]: kafeneja\Kafenë pl. kafenejet\Kafenët 
* [[Greek language|Greek]]: καφενείο (''kafenio''), [[Plural|pl.]] καφενεία(''kafenia'')
* [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: cafenea, pl. cafenele

The word itself, irrespective of regional differences, is derived from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''kahvehane'' ("[[coffeehouse]]") which is in turn derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] term ''qahveh-khaneh'' (a compound of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''qahve'' [coffee] and Persian ''khane'' [house]).

In the [[Republic of Macedonia]], ''kafeana'' is sometimes confused with the more traditional ''[[meyhane|meana]]'', while the variant ''kafana'' (adopted from commercial Serbian folk-songs and popularized by domestic artists) may be used for the establishment described in this article; however, both terms are used interchangeably by some.

Nowadays in Serbia, the term ''kafana'' is similarly used describe any informal eatery serving traditional cuisine, as well as some other classical kafana dishes like [[Wiener schnitzel]].

==History==
[[File:Kafana kod Albanije.JPG|thumb|Kafana at palace Albania, Belgrade, 1910s.]]
In the days of 18th and early 19th century, running a kafana (then usually called ''mehana'') was a family business, a craft, passed on from generation to generation.

As the [[Balkan]] cities grew in size and became more urbanized, kafana also shifted its focus a bit.  Some started serving food and offering other enticements to potential customers since owners now had to compete with other similar establishments around the city. Most bigger towns and cities in this period had a ''Gradska kafana'' (City kafana) located in or around main square where the most affluent and important individuals of that city would come to see and be seen.  Prices in this particular kafana would usually be higher compared to others around the city that didn't enjoy the privilege of such an exclusive location.

The concept of live music was introduced in the early 20th century by kafana owners looking to offer different kinds of entertainment to their guests.  Naturally, in the absence of [[mass media]] these bands strictly had a local character and would only play [[folk music]] that was popular within a particular region where the city lies.

As the 20th century rolled on, Balkan cities saw waves upon waves of rural population coming in, especially after [[World War II]], and kafane diversified accordingly. Some continued to uphold a higher standard of service, while others began to cater to newly arrived rural population that mostly found employment in factories and on construction sites.

This is when the term ''kafana'' slowly began to be associated with something undesirable and suitable only for lower classes of society.  By the 1980s, term ''kafana'' became almost an insult and most owners would steer clear of calling their places by that name, preferring westernized terms like ''[[restaurant]]'', ''[[café|cafe]]'', ''bistro'', ''[[coffee bar]]'', and so on, instead. On the other hand, terms ''birtija'', ''bircuz'' and ''krčma'' are also used to denote, usually rural or suburban, filthy kafane.

== The stereotype ==
It is not quite clear when the term ''kafana'' became instantly synonymous with decay, sloth, pain, backwardness, sorrow, etc. all across [[SFR Yugoslavia]], but it is safe to say it happened in the 1970s or 1980s. Pop culture played a significant part in this transformation. Massively popular folk singers began to emerge, spurred on by the expansion of radio and television, often using kafana themes in their songs. Since the connection between commercial folk and rural regressiveness was already well established, kafana, too, got a dodgy rap by extension.

During the 1960s, in contrast to the state-sponsored [[Partisan film]]s, Yugoslav movies of the [[Yugoslav Black Wave|Black Wave]] movement started depicting contemporary individuals from the margins of society. Run-down kafane would feature prominently in such stories. Socially relevant films like ''[[Skupljači perja|I Even Met Happy Gypsies]]'', ''[[Otac na službenom putu|When Father Was Away on Business]]'', ''[[Život je lep]]'', ''[[Do You Remember Dolly Bell?]]'', ''[[Specijalno vaspitanje]]'', ''[[Kuduz]]'', etc. all had memorable, dramatic scenes that take place in dilapidated rural or suburban kafana. Soon, a distinct cinematic stereotype appeared.

In [[Mate Bulić]]'s album ''[[Gori borovina]]'', there is a song "Ej, kavano", which describes the common stereotype of the kafana.

=== Social stereotype ===
Kafana is stereotyped as a place where sad lovers cure their sorrows in alcohol and music, [[gambler]]s squander entire fortunes, husbands run away from mean wives while shady businessmen, corrupt local politicians and petty criminals do business. As in many other societies, frequenting kafane is seen as a mainly male activity, and "honest" women dare only visit finer ones, usually in the company of men.

As mentioned, it is a very frequent motif of late-20th century commercial folk songs, perhaps the most famous being "I tebe sam sit kafano" (''I'm Already Sick of You, Kafana'') by [[Haris Džinović]], "Kafana je moja sudbina" (''Kafana is My Destiny'') by [[Toma Zdravković]], and the ubiquitous "Čaše lomim" (''I'm Breaking Glasses''), originally by Nezir Eminovski.

== By country ==

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
Probably the purest form of kafana can be found in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] where no food is served (differentiating kafana from ''[[ćevapi|ćevabdžinica]]'', ''aščinica'' and ''[[burek|buregdžinica]]''), staying true to the original [[Turkish coffee]] and alcohol concept.

In Bosnian cities with large [[Muslim]] populations, one can still find certain old kafane that probably didn't look much different back when the [[Ottomans]] ruled Bosnia. They are now mostly frequented by local elders as well as the occasional tourist, and their numbers are dwindling.

Most of the old centerpiece ''Gradske Kafane'' have been visually modernized and had their names changed in the process to something snappy and western-sounding. Most other establishments that offer similar fare target a younger crowd and prefer not to use the term ''kafana''. However, stereotypical kafanas hold some popularity amongst high-schoolers and students, as well as working class men, who frequent them as places to binge drink due to their affordable prices.

=== Serbia ===
[[Image:Cafe kod znaka pitanja.png|right|thumb|270px|Famous [[? (bistro)|kafana '''"?"''']] in downtown [[Belgrade]]]]
City of Belgrade features many establishments equipped with extensive kitchens serving elaborate [[menu]]s that are officially called restaurants yet most patrons refer to them as ''kafane''.

According to some, the first kafana in Belgrade opened sometime after 1738, when the Ottomans recaptured the city from the Austrians. Its name was Crni orao (Black Eagle) and it was located in [[Dorćol]] neighbourhood, at the intersection of today's Kralja Petra and Dušanova streets. Its patrons were only served Turkish black coffee poured from silver [[ibrik]] into a [[demitasse|fildžan]] as well as [[nargile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Pogledi-sa-strane/Pohvala-razvoju-beogradske-kafe-kulture-kafana.lt.html Pohvala razvoju beogradske kafe-kulture: kafana];''Politika'', 10 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of eating in Serbian kafane was introduced in the 19th century when the menu consisted mostly of simply snacks, such as [[ćevapčići]]. The menus soon expanded as food became large part of the appeal of Belgrade kafane that originated in the 19th and early 20th century like the famous [[Znak pitanja|?]] (Question Mark), Lipov lad (The Linden Tree's Shade, opened in 1928), and Tri lista duvana (Three Tobacco Leaves), as well as [[Skadarlija]] [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] spots Tri šešira (Three Hats), Dva bela goluba (Two Doves), Šešir moj (This Hat of Mine), Dva jelena (Two Deer), Zlatni bokal (The Golden Jug), and Ima dana (There's Time). Another kafana that gained notoriety during the early 20th century was [[Zlatna moruna]] (The Golden Beluga) at the [[Zeleni Venac]] neighbourhood where [[Young Bosnia]] conspirators frequently gathered while plotting the June 1914 [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of Austro-Hungarian archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]]. Certain kafane had their names preserved through the structures that succeeded them in the same location; [[Palace Albanija]], built in 1940 in central Belgrade got its name from the kafana that used to be there from 1860 until 1936.

Post [[World War II]] period gave a rise in popularity to kafane like Šumatovac, Pod lipom (Under the [[Lime Tree]]), and Grmeč in Makedonska Street (nicknamed the 'Bermuda triangle'),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120904221330/http://www.mondo.rs/v2/tekst.php?vest=47423 Film o beogradskom „Bermudskom trouglu“]; MTS Mondo, 15 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Manjež, as well as later establishments like Madera, Kod Ive (Ivo's), and [[Klub književnika]] (the Writers' Club).

Even the traditionally upscale restaurant joints like [[Ruski car Tavern|Ruski car]] (Russian Tsar) and [[Grčka Kraljica]] (Greek Queen) weren't above being referred to as kafana.

Things have somewhat changed, however, since approximately the 1970s with the influx of Western [[pop culture|pop]] and [[media culture]]s taking root. Most of the younger Serbian crowd started to associate the term ''kafana'' with something archaic and [[passe]] so the owners of places that cater to them began avoiding it altogether. Terms such as "kafić", initially and later "kafe" began to be used more frequently. An example would be Zlatni papagaj (Golden Parrot) in Belgrade, a ''kafić'' that opened in September 1979 and almost immediately became the main gathering point for the city's well-dressed youngsters from affluent families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Pogledi-sa-strane/Pohvala-razvoju-beogradske-kafe-kulture-kafic.lt.html Pohvala razvoju beogradske kafe-kulture: kafić];''Politika'', 22 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in the mid-1980s, kafić called Nana in [[Senjak]] neighbourhood became a favourite tough guy and mobster hangout.

The trend of moving away from the term ''kafana'' continued into the 1990s, and early 2000s. With [[gentrification]] taking root in many parts of central Belgrade, these new establishments mostly stay away from traditionalism. Good examples of this would be the numerous watering holes that have sprung up over the last 15 years in Strahinjića Bana Street, such as Veprov dah, Ipanema, Kandahar, and Dorian Gray, or various new restaurants in downtown Belgrade - none of these places are referred to as ''kafane'', either by their owners or by their patrons.

===Croatia===
In [[Croatia]], the term for kafana is ''ka'''v'''ana'' (as coffee is spelled ''kava'' in [[Croatian language|Croatian]]) and they differ widely between continental Croatia and the [[Dalmatian coast]]. ''Kafić'' (pl. ''kafići'') is a more general term encompassing all establishments serving coffee and alcohol drinks only, while ''kavana'' is the name for distinctly styled bistros described in this article.

===Macedonia===
Currently, there are 5,206 kafeani in the country. According to the State Statistical Office, there are 989 kafeani (19% of the total number) in the capital [[Skopje]], 413 in [[Tetovo]], 257 in [[Bitola]], 244 in [[Gostivar]], 206 in [[Kumanovo]], 205 in [[Struga]], 188 in [[Ohrid]] and 161 in [[Strumica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default-mk.asp?ItemID=C0CA40215260E34D9F85F61C30BE3808&amp;arc=1 Dnevnik newspaper (Macedonia)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727211436/http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default-mk.asp?ItemID=C0CA40215260E34D9F85F61C30BE3808&amp;arc=1 |date=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albania===
[[File:Streets of Tirana 2016.jpg|thumb|Cafes along Mustafa Matohiti St near Blloku district in central Tirana]]
In 2016, Albania surpassed Spain by becoming the country with the most coffee houses per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocnal.com/2018/02/albania-ranked-first-in-world-for.html&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there are 654 coffee houses per 100,000 inhabitants in Albania, a country with only 2.5 million inhabitants. This is due to coffee houses closing down in Spain due to the economic crisis, and the fact that as many cafes open as they close in Albania. In addition, the fact that it was one of the easiest ways to make a living after the fall of communism in Albania, together with the country’s Ottoman legacy further reinforce the strong dominance of coffee culture in Albania.

A '''kanzu''' is a white or cream coloured robe worn by men in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. It is referred to as a '''tunic''' in English, and as the '''[[Thawb]]''' in Arab countries. The kanzu is an ankle or floor length garment. It serves as the [[national costume]] of [[Tanzania]] as well as the [[Comoros]], where it is called/pronounced 'Kandu' as well as thawb. The robe is also worn in some coastal [[Muslim]] regions of [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]. The men of [[Uganda]] in [[Uganda]] consider it their most important dress. Kanzu is a [[Ganda language|Ganda]] word of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] origin, which means "robe" or "tunic". In Tanzania, the term is used interchangeably with [[kaftan]].&lt;ref name="Websters Online Dictionary"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/ka/kanzu.html|title=Definition of Kanzu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ugandan kanzu==
The [[Buganda|Kiganda]]/[[Uganda]]n kanzu was introduced to the Buganda Kingdom by [[Arab]] traders.&lt;ref name="Ugandalink"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ugandanlink.com/features/kanzu.html|title=Kanzu:  A Traditional Costume}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kabaka Ssuuna was the first [[Kabaka of Buganda]] to wear the kanzu. After the Kabaka adopted the attire it became the [[formal wear]] of all [[Baganda]] men.  The kanzu spread from the [[Baganda]] people to other ethnicities and is a [[national costume]] of Baganda men. (The Republic of Uganda has no national costume for men).

It is a variation of the Arabic [[Thawb|thobe]].  Originally, the kanzu was made from  [[barkcloth]]. Today the kanzu is made from [[silk]], [[cotton]], [[poplin]], or [[linen]].  Linen kanzus are the most expensive.  The main difference between the kanzu and the Arabic [[Thawb|thobe]] is the design.

The traditional kanzu has maroon embroidery around the collar, abdomen, and sleeves. The embroidery is called the '''omulela'''.  The major center of kanzu knitting and production is Mende, Uganda.

The kanzu is worn at [[wedding]] ceremonies during the introduction, also known as the [[Kwanjula]].  During the [[Kwanjula]] the groom's family is required to appear dressed in kanzu and they must also present a kanzu to the bride's family.

The kanzu is worn with a [[suit jacket]], [[blazer]], or [[sport coat]].  It is customary for important persons to wear the kanzu with a black [[Bisht (clothing)|bisht]]. Traditional attire for women in Baganda is the [[Gomesi]].

In popular culture, Ugandan clothing was featured in the controversial film,  ''[[The Last King of Scotland (film)|The Last King of Scotland]]''.

==Tanzanian kanzu==
In [[Tanzania]], the kanzu was introduced by [[Arab]] traders and missionaries from [[Oman]]  who were conducting [[dawah]].  The Tanzanian kanzu is identical to the Arabic [[Thawb|thobe]].  Originally, the kanzu was made from [[silk]].  Today, due to [[Islam]]ic restrictions on silk garments, it is made from [[polyester]] or other synthetic fabrics made to resemble silk.  The distinctive feature of the Tanzanian kanzu is the [[tassel]] that hangs from the collar.  In some families, the tassel is [[perfume]]d with African oils or Arabic [[Ittar|attar]] (oils) before [[wedding]] ceremonies.  The kanzu is always worn with a [[Kofia (hat)|kofia]], a small embroidered cap.&lt;ref name="Mzuri Kaja Caps"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mzuri-kaja.or.tz/mzuri%20caps.html|title=Mzuri Kaja Caps|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704201013/http://www.mzuri-kaja.or.tz/mzuri%20caps.html|archivedate=2009-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, and in many Arab countries, the Tanzanian kanzu is sold by merchants as an ''Omani thobe'', ''Yemini dishdasha'', or ''Emirati thobe''.  The best quality kanzus are manufactured in the [[United Arab Emirates]].  HKT is one manufacturer.  [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] and inexpensive Chinese made versions are common.
[[File:Kofia.JPG|thumb|A traditional [[Kofia (hat)|Kofia]] (cap).]]
Among the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] men of Tanzania and [[Kenya]], the kanzu is always worn with a [[suit jacket]], [[blazer]], or [[sport coat]].&lt;ref name="Kenya Information Center"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kenya-information-guide.com/swahili-tribe.html|title=The Swahili tribe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[formal wear]] a Tanzanian man will don a kanzu, a suit jacket, and a [[Kofia (hat)|kofia]] (cap).&lt;ref name="Mzuri Kaja Caps"/&gt;  [[Tribal chief]]s wear the kanzu with a black [[Bisht (clothing)|bisht]] when attending a black tie event. A white or ivory [[Bisht (clothing)|bisht]] is worn to [[white tie]] events.  In many Western countries, the bisht is sold by merchants as a ''Saudi abaya''  or ''Abayah''.  According to custom, a kanzu must be ''crisp'', that is [[dry cleaning|dry cleaned]] and [[Ironing|starched]], before it is suitable for formal wear.

The kanzu is the [[national costume]] of [[Tanzania]], and is the [[formal wear]] of most of the tribes in the country.  For informal events, a Saudi manufactured [[Thawb|thobe]] with a [[mandarin collar]] or the [[dashiki]] shirt and a [[Kofia (hat)|kofia]]  is the traditional attire.  Although the Tanzanian kanzu was borrowed from Arab culture, it is worn by all religious faiths, including [[Christian]]s, [[Muslim]]s, [[African Jews]], and members of [[African traditional religion]]s.

==Kenya==
In [[Kenya]], the Tanzanian Kanzu is worn by Muslims of all tribes.  Christians wear the kanzu (rarely)for informal events, including church services, but the [[dashiki]] shirt or [[kitenge]] shirt is used as [[formal wear]] for Christian weddings.  Both religious communities wear a [[Kofia (hat)|kofia]], a small cap with the kanzu.  In Kenya, it is customary for [[Tribal chief]]s and Muslim [[Imam]]s to wear a black [[Bisht (clothing)|bisht]] with the kanzu when attending a formal event.  Kenya is unique among African nations in that it is the only country that does not have a [[national costume]].&lt;ref name="BBC.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3660698.stm|title=Kenya Unveils First National Dress | work=BBC News | date=2004-09-16 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, many Kenyan men wear European [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s or [[black tie|tuxedo]]s for weddings and other formal events.  Others have started to wear the Nigerian national costume which is called an [[Boubou (clothing)|Agbada]].&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/africa/3070131.stm|title=Kenya MPs Fight Colonial Dress Code | work=BBC News | date=2003-07-17 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Kenya, male Members of the Parliament are required to wear a European style suit to  sessions.&lt;ref name="bbc.news.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3492932.stm|title=What is an African Dress Code? | work=BBC News | date=2004-03-01 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Africa==

In [[West Africa]], similar yet highly distinct clothing are worn by predominantly [[Sahel]]ian peoples. These include the [[Senegalese kaftan]] and the [[Boubou (clothing)|Boubou]] (often worn on formal occasions).

==Wedding attire==
The kanzu is the traditional wedding attire for men in the Great Lakes region. During wedding ceremonies it is customary for the groom to wear a white kanzu and a [[kofia (hat)|kofia]]. In Tanzania and Kenya, the groom wears a black or white [[bisht (clothing)|bisht]] on top of the kanzu. The groomsmen and other men who are members of the wedding party wear the kanzu with a suit jacket. In Uganda, the groom wears a suit jacket on top of the kanzu, and the bride's attire is the [[gomesi]].

In Tanzania and Kenya, the bride's attire is a white [[wedding dress]] or the West African [[Wrapper (clothing)|boubou]]. Use of wedding attire characteristic of the Great Lakes region has spread throughout the [[African diaspora]]. There are also some locals who prefer to wed in West African attire (see the [[dashiki]]).

Perhaps the best known of the southern savanna kingdoms is that of the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]], which developed during the early seventeenth century and reached its peak in the second half of the nineteenth. The historian Jan Vansina divides Kuba history in six phases surrounding a chronology of leaders and seminal events.&lt;ref name="Vansina 1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vansina|first=Jan|title=Recording the Oral History of the Bakuba – II. Results|journal=The Journal of African History|date=1960|volume=1|issue=2|page=261|doi=10.1017/s0021853700001833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen different ethnic groups are included in the kingdom, which still exists and is presided over by the ''nyim'', or king. 

Art associated with the Kuba is renowned for its broadly diverse array of media. A great deal of the art was created for the courts of chiefs and kings and was profusely decorated, incorporating [[cowrie shells]] and animal skins (especially leopard) as symbols of wealth, prestige and power. Masks are also important to the Kuba. They are used both in the rituals of the court and in the initiation of boys into adulthood, as well as at funerals. The Kuba are also known for the production of beautifully embroidered [[raffia |raffia textiles]], made for adornment, woven currency, or as tributary  goods for funerals and other seminal occasions.&lt;ref name="Cornet 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornet|first=Joseph|title=Art Royal Kuba|year=1982|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth and power of the elaborate court system allowed the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] to develop a class of professional artisans who worked primarily for the courts but also produced objects of high quality for other individuals of high status.&lt;ref name="Brooklyn Museum 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Seigmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639 |author2=Dumouchelle, Kevin D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decorative arts and surface design==

Kuba art is celebrated for its decorative arts and surface designs.  Personal and decorative artistry is expressed in flatwork – woven cloth or designs on mats and textiles – as well as three-dimensional objects – lidded bowls and boxes, cups, clysters, musical instruments, knives with decorated handles, and baskets.&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binkley|first=David A|title=Kuba|year=2009|publisher=5 Continents Edition|location=Milan|author2=Patricia Darish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior and interior surfaces of the [[raffia]]-walled homes of Kuba elites were also plated with intricate geometric patterning. This proclivity for surface design was shared across most media, including Kuba textiles and body scarification.&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009" /&gt;

==Kuba textiles==
{{main|Kuba textiles}}

== Kuba headdresses ==

Headdresses are major symbols of power in traditional Kuba society. They are the symbols of a person’s role in an intricate system of leadership and titleholding, and are usually buried with the owner at their time of death. Headdresses are designed to call attention to the head as the source of divine power, and are worn at dances, funerals, and other major communal ceremonies. Cotton cloth, cowrie shell, raffia fiber, wood, and glass beads are commonly used materials in the creation of various headdresses. The mpaan is one example of a Kuba headdress, although it’s exclusively worn by female titleholders. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Crowning Achievements: African Arts of Dressing the Head|last = Kreamer, Arnoldin|first = Christine, Mary Jo|publisher = University of California Los Angeles, Fowler|year = 1995|isbn = 0930741439|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kuba masks==
''See full article: [[Kuba masquerade]]''

Among the Kuba, masks are thought to be reflections of nature-spirits ([[mingesh]]) that act as intermediaries between the Supreme Being (Nyeem) and the world of mortals. There are more than twenty different types of masks that function within the men's initiation society. Moshambwooy is one of the three most important and represents Woot, the founding hero from whom the Kuba believe themselves to be descended.

==Kuba ndop==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 61.33 Ndop Portrait of King Mishe miShyaang maMbul (5).jpg|thumbnail|Ndop of king Mishe miShyaang maMbul; 1760-1780; wood; 49.5 x 19.4 x 21.9 cm (19{{fraction|1|2}} x 7{{fraction|5|8}} x 8{{fraction|5|8}} in.); [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City). [[Ndop (Kuba)|Ndop]]s are royal memorial portraits caverd by the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] people of [[Central Africa]]. They are not naturalistic portrayals but are intended as representations of the king's spirit and as an encapsulation  of the principal of kingship]]
{{main|Ndop (Kuba)}}

Kuba kings were sometimes commemorated by 'portraits' that were carved to encapsulate principles of kingship. However, unlike portraiture in European art, these figures, called ndop, were not actual representations of the deceased king but a carving of his spirit, produced after the death of the king. Measuring about 48-55 centimeters in height, ndop are carved of hardwood, which is unusual in African art, and they are in a posture that is equally rare in African sculpture. Each sits crosslegged on a square base from which a small wooden object projects. The figures' identities can be determined according to these emblematic objects.&lt;ref name="Adams 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Monni|title=18th-Century Kuba King Figures|journal=African Arts|date=May 1988|volume=21|issue=3|page=32-38+88|doi=10.2307/3336440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kuba drinking vessels==
{{see also|19th Century Drinking Horn}}
Ornately carved wooden containers were kept by Kuba to store costume accessories and items used for personal care. These included razors, beads, and [[Camwood|camwood powder]] used to coat and beautify the skin. Surface decoration that cover these vessels and boxes are known as ''nnaam'', a Kuba term referring to the tangled vines and creepers that grow in the fertile forests of this region. The replication of a woven basketry artifact in carved wood is characteristic of the playful invention of Kuba personal arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vessel: Lidded|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/50003322|work=Collections|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the court, drinking vessels were used to drink and serve palm wine, which Kuba titleholders would distribute in large quantities to their friends and associates in order to display their wealth and generosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vessel: Head|url=http://metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/50003582?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=*&amp;where=Democratic+Republic+of+the+Congo&amp;pos=15|work=Collections|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philipgouldcollection.wordpress.com/2016/05/28/kuba-wood-cups-2-zaire/|title=Kuba wood cups (part 2) (Zaire)|date=2016-05-28|website=The Philip Gould Collection|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberalism''' is a [[Political philosophy|political]] and [[moral philosophy]] based on [[liberty]] and [[Egalitarianism|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;"liberalism In general, the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize freedom of choice." ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, Third edition 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920516-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"political rationalism, hostility to autocracy, cultural distaste for conservatism and for tradition in general, tolerance, and [...] individualism".

This is primordial liberalism, as the liberty to think is itself the first and noblest of liberties. Man would not be free in any degree or in any sphere of action, if he were not a thinking being endowed with consciousness. The freedom of worship, the freedom of education, and the freedom of the press are derived the most directly from the freedom to think.|year=1883|accessdate=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism became a distinct [[Political movement|movement]] in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when it became popular among [[Western world|Western]] philosophers and economists. Liberalism sought to replace the [[Norm (social)|norms]] of [[Nobility|hereditary privilege]], [[state religion]], [[absolute monarchy]], the [[divine right of kings]] and [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatism]] with [[representative democracy]] and the [[rule of law]]. Liberals also ended [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies, [[Legal monopoly|royal monopolies]] and other [[Trade barrier|barriers to trade]], instead promoting free markets.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"/&gt; Philosopher [[John Locke]] is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct tradition, arguing that each man has a [[Natural and legal rights|natural right]] to [[life, liberty and property]],&lt;ref&gt;"All mankind [...] being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions", John Locke, ''Second Treatise of Government''&lt;/ref&gt; adding that governments must not violate these [[rights]] based on the [[social contract]]. While the [[Gladstonian liberalism|British liberal tradition]] has emphasised expanding democracy, [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|French liberalism]] has emphasised rejecting [[authoritarianism]] and is linked to [[Nationalism|nation-building]].&lt;ref name="Kirchner, p. 3"&gt;Kirchner, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within [[Islam]], which continues to this day, leading to [[Islamic revivalism]].

In Europe and North America, the establishment of [[social liberalism]] (often called simply "[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]" in the United States) became a key component in the expansion of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"] by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] (1956) from: ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962). "Liberalism in the U.S. usage has little in common with the word as used in the politics of any other country, save possibly Britain."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Liberal Party|liberal parties]] continue to wield power and influence [[Liberalism by country|throughout the world]]. However, liberalism still has challenges to overcome in Africa and Asia. The fundamental elements of [[Modernity|contemporary society]] have liberal roots. The early waves of liberalism popularised economic individualism while expanding [[constitution]]al [[government]] and [[parliament]]ary authority.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"&gt;Gould, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals sought and established a constitutional order that prized important [[Civil liberties|individual freedoms]], such as  [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of association]]; an [[Independence of the judiciary|independent judiciary]] and public [[Jury trial|trial by jury]]; and the abolition of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privileges.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 3"/&gt; Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil rights.&lt;ref name="Worell470"&gt;Worell, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals have [[Advocacy|advocated]] gender and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a [[Civil rights movements|global civil rights movement]] in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals. Continental European liberalism is divided between [[moderate]]s and [[Progressivism|progressives]], with the moderates tending to [[elitism]] and the progressives supporting the universalisation of fundamental institutions, such as [[universal suffrage]], [[Universal access to education|universal education]] and the expansion of [[Property|property rights]]. Over time, the moderates displaced the progressives as the main guardians of continental European liberalism.&lt;ref name="Kirchner, p. 3"/&gt;

== Etymology and definition ==
Words such as [[wikt:Liberal|liberal]], [[wikt:Liberty|liberty]], [[wikt:Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[libertine]] all trace their history to the Latin ''[[wikt:Liber|liber]]'', which means "[[wikt:Free|free]]".&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"&gt;Gross, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded instances of the word "liberal" occurs in 1375, when it was used to describe the [[liberal arts]] in the context of an education desirable for a free-born man.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; The word's early connection with the classical education of a medieval university soon gave way to a proliferation of different denotations and connotations. "Liberal" could refer to "free in bestowing" as early as 1387, "made without stint" in 1433, "freely permitted" in 1530 and "free from restraint"—often as a pejorative remark—in the 16th and the 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In 16th century [[Kingdom of England|England]], "liberal" could have positive or negative attributes in referring to someone's generosity or indiscretion.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] wrote of "a liberal villaine" who "hath [...] confest his vile encounters".&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; With the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the word acquired decisively more positive undertones, being defined as "free from narrow prejudice" in 1781 and "free from bigotry" in 1823.&lt;ref name="Gross, p. 5"/&gt; In 1815, the first use of the word "liberalism" appeared in English.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchner, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the ''[[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|liberales]]'', the first group to use the liberal label in a political context,&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; fought for decades for the implementation of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]]. From 1820 to 1823 during the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'', [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] was compelled by the ''liberales'' to swear to uphold the Constitution. By the middle of the 19th century, "liberal" was used as a politicised term for parties and movements worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Emil J. Kirchner, ''Liberal Parties in Western Europe'', "Liberal parties were among the first political parties to form, and their long-serving and influential records, as participants in parliaments and governments, raise important questions [...]", Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32394-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the meaning of the word "liberalism" began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': "In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;"Liberalism", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the ideas of [[individualism]] and ''laissez-faire'' economics previously associated with classical liberalism became the basis for the emerging school of [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] thought&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard121.html ''The Libertarian Heritage: The American Revolution and Classical Liberalism]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and are key components of [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]].

Unlike Europe and Latin America, the word "liberalism" in North America almost exclusively refers to social liberalism. The dominant Canadian party is the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the United States' [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is usually considered liberal.&lt;ref&gt;Puddington, p. 142. "After a dozen years of centre-left Liberal Party rule, the Conservative Party emerged from the 2006 parliamentary elections with a plurality and established a fragile minority government."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, pp. 106–07. [Talking about the Democratic Party] "Its liberalism is for the most part the later version of liberalism – modern liberalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p. 3. "Modern liberalism occupies the left-of-center in the traditional political spectrum and is represented by the Democratic Party in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Liberalism—both as a political current and an intellectual tradition—is mostly a modern phenomenon that started in the 17th century, although some liberal philosophical ideas had precursors in [[classical antiquity]] and in [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]].&lt;ref name="BevirSAGE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungCambridge"/&gt; The [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] praised, "the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Antoninus, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have also recognised a number of principles familiar to contemporary liberals in the works of several [[Sophism|Sophists]] and in the ''Funeral Oration'' by [[Pericles]].&lt;ref name="Young, pp. 25–6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal philosophy symbolises an extensive intellectual tradition that has examined and popularised some of the most important and controversial principles of the modern world. Its immense scholarly and academic output has been characterised as containing "richness and diversity", but that diversity often has meant that liberalism comes in different formulations and presents a challenge to anyone looking for a clear definition.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major themes ===
{{Individualism sidebar|expanded=Philosophies}}
Though all liberal doctrines possess a common heritage, scholars frequently assume that those doctrines contain "separate and often contradictory streams of thought".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 24"/&gt; The objectives of [[List of liberal theorists|liberal theorists and philosophers]] have differed across various times, cultures and continents. The diversity of liberalism can be gleaned from the numerous adjectives that liberal thinkers and movements have attached to the very term "liberalism", including [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], [[Economic liberalism|economic]], [[Social liberalism|social]], [[welfare state]], [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Humanism|humanist]], [[Deontological ethics|deontological]], [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionist]], [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[institution]]al,  to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these variations, liberal thought does exhibit a few definite and fundamental conceptions. At its very root, liberalism is a philosophy about the meaning of humanity and society.

Political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] identified the common strands in liberal thought as being individualist, egalitarian, [[meliorism|meliorist]] and [[Universalism|universalist]]. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of social [[collectivism]], the egalitarian element assigns the same [[Morality|moral]] worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local [[Culture|cultural]] differences.&lt;ref name="Gray, p. xii"&gt;Gray, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The meliorist element has been the subject of much controversy, defended by thinkers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] who believed in human progress while suffering criticism by thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who instead believed that human attempts to improve themselves through social [[cooperation]] would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, pp. 33–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the liberal temperament, Gray claimed that it "has been inspired by scepticism and by a fideistic certainty of divine revelation&amp;nbsp;[...] it has exalted the power of reason even as, in other contexts, it has sought to humble reason's claims".{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The liberal philosophical tradition has searched for validation and justification through several intellectual projects. The moral and political suppositions of liberalism have been based on traditions such as natural rights and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian theory]], although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles.&lt;ref name="Gray, p. xii"/&gt; Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and [[individual liberty]], supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[toleration]], autonomy, [[bodily integrity]] and [[Consent of the governed|consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical and modern ===
Enlightenment philosophers are given credit for shaping liberal ideas. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct [[ideology]] by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.&lt;ref name="Delaney, p. 18"&gt;Delaney, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin et al., p. 12"&gt;Godwin et al., p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]] attempted to determine the purpose and the justification of governing authority in a post-civil war England. Employing the idea of a state of nature—a hypothetical war-like scenario prior to the state—he constructed the idea of a social contract that individuals enter into to guarantee their security and in so doing form the State, concluding that only an absolute sovereign would be fully able to sustain such a peace. Hobbes had developed the concept of the social contract, according to which individuals in the anarchic and brutal state of nature came together and voluntarily ceded some of their individual rights to an established state authority, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Whereas Hobbes advocated a strong monarchical authority (the [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]), Locke developed the then radical notion that government acquires [[Consent of the governed|consent from the governed]] which has to be constantly present for the government to remain legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; While adopting Hobbes's idea of a state of nature and social contract, Locke nevertheless argued that when the monarch becomes a tyrant, it constituted a violation of the social contract, which bestows life, liberty and property as a natural right. He concluded that the people have a right to overthrow a tyrant. By placing life, liberty and property as the supreme value of law and authority, Locke formulated the basis of liberalism based on social contract theory. To these early enlightenment thinkers, securing the most essential amenities of life—[[liberty]] and [[private property]] among them—required the formation of a "sovereign" authority with universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His influential ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Two Treatises]]'' (1690), the foundational text of liberal ideology, outlined his major ideas. Once humans moved out of their [[State of nature|natural state]] and formed societies, Locke argued as follows: "Thus that which begins and actually constitutes any [[State (polity)|political society]] is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite and incorporate into such a society. And this is that, and that only, which did or could give beginning to any lawful government in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The stringent insistence that lawful government did not have a [[supernatural]] basis was a sharp break with the dominant theories of governance which advocated the divine right of kings&lt;ref&gt;Forster, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and echoed the earlier thought of [[Aristotle]]. One political scientist described this new thinking as follows: "In the liberal understanding, there are no citizens within the regime who can claim to rule by natural or supernatural right, without the consent of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Zvesper, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke had other intellectual opponents besides Hobbes. In the ''First Treatise'', Locke aimed his guns first and foremost at one of the doyens of 17th century English conservative philosophy: [[Robert Filmer]]. Filmer's ''Patriarcha'' (1680) argued for the [[divine right of kings]] by appealing to [[Bible|biblical]] teaching, claiming that the authority granted to [[Adam]] by [[God]] gave successors of Adam in the male line of descent a right of dominion over all other humans and creatures in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Locke disagreed so thoroughly and obsessively with Filmer that the ''First Treatise'' is almost a sentence-by-sentence refutation of ''Patriarcha''. Reinforcing his respect for consensus, Locke argued that "conjugal society is made up by a voluntary compact between men and women".&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"&gt;Kerber, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke maintained that the grant of dominion in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] was not to [[Male privilege|men over women]], as Filmer believed, but to humans over animals.&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"/&gt; Locke was certainly no [[feminism|feminist]] by modern standards, but the first major liberal thinker in history accomplished an equally major task on the road to making the world more pluralistic: the integration of women into [[social theory]].&lt;ref name="Kerber, p. 189"/&gt;

[[File:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644) argued for the importance of [[freedom of speech]]]]
Locke also originated the concept of the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29 ("It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.")&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the social contract principle, Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He also formulated a general defence for [[religious toleration]] in his ''Letters Concerning Toleration''. Three arguments are central: (1) earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) even if they could, enforcing a single "[[Supremacism#Religious|true religion]]" would not have the desired effect because belief cannot be compelled by [[Religious violence|violence]]; (3) coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke was also influenced by the liberal ideas of [[Presbyterian]] politician and poet [[John Milton]], who was a staunch advocate of freedom in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Heinrich | last = Bornkamm | language = German | contribution = Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | year = 1962}}, 3. Auflage, Band VI, col. 942&lt;/ref&gt; Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad [[Religious toleration|toleration]]. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognise the persuasive force of the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, William Bridges. ''A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8'' (East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980). pp. 71, 72. {{ISBN|0-8387-1841-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As assistant to [[Oliver Cromwell]], Milton also took part in drafting a constitution of the [[Independent politician|independents]] (''Agreement of the People''; 1647) that strongly stressed the equality of all humans as a consequence of democratic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Wertenbruch | contribution = Menschenrechte | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | language = German | place = Tübingen, DE | year = 1960}}, 3. Auflage, Band IV, col. 869&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Areopagitica]]'', Milton provided one of the first arguments for the importance of freedom of speech—"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties". His central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason to distinguish right from wrong. To be able to exercise this right, everyone must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in "[[Marketplace of ideas|a free and open encounter]]" and this will allow the good arguments to prevail.

In a natural state of affairs, liberals argued, humans were driven by the instincts of survival and [[self-preservation]] and the only way to escape from such a dangerous existence was to form a common and supreme power capable of arbitrating between competing human desires.&lt;ref name="Young 30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This power could be formed in the framework of a [[civil society]] that allows individuals to make a voluntary social contract with the sovereign authority, transferring their natural rights to that authority in return for the protection of life, liberty and property.&lt;ref name="Young 30" /&gt; These early liberals often disagreed about the most appropriate form of government, but they all shared the belief that liberty was natural and that its restriction needed strong justification.&lt;ref name="Young 30" /&gt; Liberals generally believed in limited government, although several liberal philosophers decried government outright, with [[Thomas Paine]] writing "government even in its best state is a necessary evil".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the project to limit the powers of government, various liberal theorists such as [[James Madison]] and [[Montesquieu]] conceived the notion of [[separation of powers]], a system designed to equally distribute governmental authority among the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 31" /&gt; Governments had to realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and [[revolution]], if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support limited [[Constitution#Governmental constitutions|constitutional government]] while also advocating for [[Social services|state services]] and [[Provisioning|provisions]] to ensure equal rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees of individual rights are irrelevant when individuals lack the material means to benefit from those rights and call for a [[Economic interventionism|greater role for government]] in the administration of economic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=32–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early liberals also laid the groundwork for the separation of church and state. As heirs of the Enlightenment, liberals believed that any given social and political order emanated [[Consent of the governed|from human interactions]], not from [[Divine law|divine will]].&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 4"&gt;Gould, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Many liberals were openly hostile to [[religious belief]] itself, but most concentrated their opposition to the union of religious and political authority, arguing that faith could prosper on its own, without official sponsorship or administration by the state.&lt;ref name="Gould, p. 4"/&gt;

Beyond identifying a clear role for government in modern society, liberals also have obsessed over the meaning and nature of the most important principle in liberal philosophy, namely liberty. From the 17th century until the 19th century, liberals (from [[Adam Smith]] to [[John Stuart Mill]]) conceptualised liberty as the absence of interference from government and from other individuals, claiming that all people should have the freedom to develop their own unique abilities and capacities without being sabotaged by others.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859), one of the classic texts in liberal philosophy, proclaimed, "the only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 33"/&gt; Support for ''laissez-faire'' [[capitalism]] is often associated with this principle, with [[Friedrich Hayek]] arguing in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) that reliance on free markets would preclude totalitarian control by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomashillgreen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Thomas Hill Green]] was an influential [[List of liberal theorists|liberal philosopher]] who in ''Prolegomena to Ethics'' (1884) established the first major foundations for what later became known as [[positive liberty]] and in a few years his ideas became the [[Liberal welfare reforms|official policy]] of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|Britain]], precipitating the rise of social liberalism and the modern [[welfare state]]]]
The development into maturity of classical liberalism took place before and after the French Revolution [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|in Britain]] and was based on the following core concepts: [[classical economics]], [[free trade]], ''laissez-faire'' government with minimal intervention and taxation and a [[balanced budget]]. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers.&lt;ref name="Vincent, pp. 29–30"&gt;Vincent, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 19th century, a new conception of liberty entered the liberal intellectual arena. This new kind of liberty became known as [[positive liberty]] to distinguish it from the prior [[negative liberty|negative version]] and it was first developed by [[British philosophy|British philosopher]] [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Green rejected the idea that humans were driven solely by [[self-interest]], emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of our [[moral character]].&lt;ref name="Adams, pp. 54–5"&gt;Adams, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; In a very profound step for the future of modern liberalism, he also tasked society and political institutions with the enhancement of individual freedom and identity and the development of moral character, will and reason and the state to create the conditions that allow for the above, giving the opportunity for genuine [[choice]].&lt;ref name="Adams, pp. 54–5"/&gt; Foreshadowing the new liberty as the freedom to act rather than to avoid suffering from the acts of others, Green wrote the following: {{quote|If it were ever reasonable to wish that the usage of words had been other than it has been [...] one might be inclined to wish that the term 'freedom' had been confined to the [...] power to do what one wills.&lt;ref&gt;Wempe, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Rather than previous liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole in which all individuals have a [[duty]] to promote the [[common good]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]] and [[John A. Hobson]]. In a few years, this ''New Liberalism'' had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand [[Universal suffrage|suffrage rights]], liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the [[Voting|democratic decision-making process]] were liable to the "[[tyranny of the majority]]", a concept explained in Mill's ''On Liberty'' and in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835) by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 36"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, liberals began demanding proper safeguards to thwart majorities in their attempts at suppressing the [[Minority rights|rights of minorities]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 36"/&gt;

Besides liberty, liberals have developed several other principles important to the construction of their philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first principle, [[Voltaire]] commented that "equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of things".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; All forms of liberalism assume in some basic sense that individuals are equal.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In maintaining that people are naturally equal, liberals assume that they all possess the same right to liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else and all people are [[Equality before the law|equal subjects before the law]].&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their understanding of equality. American philosopher [[John Rawls]] emphasised the need to ensure not only equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to develop their [[Motivation|aspirations]] in life.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"/&gt; Libertarian thinker [[Robert Nozick]] disagreed with Rawls, championing the former version of [[Equal opportunity|Lockean equality]] instead.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 40"/&gt;

To contribute to the development of liberty, liberals also have promoted concepts like pluralism and toleration. By pluralism, liberals refer to the proliferation of opinions and beliefs that characterise a stable [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|pp=42–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of their competitors and predecessors, liberals do not seek conformity and homogeneity in the way that people think. In fact, their efforts have been geared towards establishing a governing framework that [[Conflict resolution|harmonises and minimises conflicting views]], but still allows those views to exist and flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For liberal philosophy, pluralism leads easily to toleration. Since individuals will hold diverging viewpoints, liberals argue, they ought to uphold and respect the right of one another to disagree.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|2002|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the liberal perspective, toleration was initially connected to [[religious toleration]], with [[Baruch Spinoza]] condemning "the stupidity of religious persecution and ideological wars".&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"/&gt; Toleration also played a central role in the [[Kantianism|ideas of Kant]] and John Stuart Mill. Both thinkers believed that society will contain different conceptions of a good ethical life and that people should be allowed to make their own choices without interference from the state or other individuals.&lt;ref name="Young, p. 44"/&gt;

=== Liberal economic theory ===
{{main|Economic liberalism}}
[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref name="Mills, pp. 63, 68"&gt;Mills, pp. 63, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of [[Pricing|prices]] and the [[distribution of wealth]] and the [[Economic policy|policies]] the state should follow in order to maximise [[wealth]].&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"&gt;Mills, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith wrote that as long as [[Supply and demand|supply, demand]], [[price]]s and [[Competition (economics)|competition]] were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22public+good%22&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22public%20good%22 The Wealth of Nations]'', Strahan and Cadell, 1778&lt;/ref&gt; through profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[[invisible hand]]" directed individuals and firms to work toward the nation's good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"/&gt;

Smith assumed that workers could be [[Salary|paid]] as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the "[[iron law of wages]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and [[international trade]], which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed restrictive [[trade preference]]s, state grants of [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and [[employers' organisation]]s and [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Government should be limited to defence, [[public work]]s and the [[administration of justice]], financed by [[Income tax|taxes based on income]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was one of the progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the [[globalisation]] literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 69"&gt;Mills, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], Malthus theories of population and Ricardo's iron law of wages became central doctrines of classical economics.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"&gt;Mills, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Baptiste Say]] challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. Malthus wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798,&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a major influence on classical liberalism. Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several liberals, including Adam Smith and Richard Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods between nations would lead to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "Economic Freedom and Peace," in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith argued that as societies progressed the spoils of war would rise, but the costs of war would rise further, making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets.

[[Utilitarianism]] provided the [[Legitimacy (political)|political justification]] for the implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and John Stuart Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the welfare state, it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that [[public policy]] should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to [[Poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"&gt;Mills, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government [[social control]], including [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police]], [[prison reform]]s, the [[workhouse]]s and [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] for the mentally ill.

==== Keynesian economics ====
{{main|Keynesian economics}}
[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the most influential economists of modern times and whose ideas, which are still [[2008–09 Keynesian resurgence|widely felt]], formalized modern [[liberal economic]] policy]]

During the [[Great Depression]], the definitive liberal response to it was given by the English economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946). Keynes had been "brought up" as a classical liberal, but especially after World War I became increasingly a welfare or social liberal.&lt;ref&gt;See studies of Keynes by, e.g., [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], Donald Moggridge, and [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific writer, among many other works, he had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=0-415-13481-1|pages=96–100|publisher=London: Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's [[austerity]] measures [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|during the Great Depression]]. He believed that [[budget deficit]]s were a good thing, a product of [[recession]]s. He wrote: "For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill".&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|title=The Demand Doctor|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the Great Depression in 1933, Keynes published ''The Means to Prosperity'', which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter cyclical public spending. ''The Means to Prosperity'' contains one of the first mentions of the [[multiplier effect]].&lt;ref name="Skid30s"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skidelsky|first=Robert|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman|year=2003|isbn=0-330-488678|pages=494–500, 504, 509–510|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynes's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', was published in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Keith Tribe, ''Economic careers: economics and economists in Britain, 1930–1970'' (1997), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a theoretical justification for the [[Economic interventionism|interventionist policies]] Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neo-classical economics|neo-classical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the [[Market (economics)|market]] would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. [[Classical economics|Classical economists]] had believed in [[Say's law]], which simply put states that "[[supply creates its own demand]]" and that in a [[free market]] workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Sticky (economics)|price stickiness]], i.e. the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue it is [[rationality|rational]] for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of "[[aggregate demand]]" and "[[aggregate supply]]" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria and in those cases it is the state and not the market that economies must depend on for their salvation. The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. In 1928, he wrote: "Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth. [...] With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them".&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"/&gt; Where the market failed to properly allocate resources, the government was required to stimulate the economy until private funds could start flowing again—a "prime the pump" kind of strategy designed to boost [[industrial production]].&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 808.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberal feminist theory ===
{{main|Liberal feminism}}
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]], widely regarded as the pioneer of [[liberal feminism]]]]
[[Liberal feminism]], the dominant tradition in [[History of feminism|feminist history]], is an [[Individualism|individualistic]] form of [[feminist theory]] which focuses on women's ability to maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. Liberal feminists hope to eradicate all barriers to [[gender equality]], claiming that the continued existence of such barriers eviscerates the individual rights and freedoms ostensibly guaranteed by a liberal social order.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that society holds the false belief that women are by nature [[Gender inequality|less intellectually and physically capable]] than men; thus it tends to [[Sexism|discriminate against women]] in the [[Sexism in academia|academy]], the forum and the [[Occupational sexism|marketplace]]. Liberal feminists believe that "female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women's entrance to and success in the so-called public world". They strive for sexual equality via political and legal reform.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"&gt;Tong, Rosemarie. 1989. Feminist Thought: A Comprehensive Introduction. Oxon, United Kingdom: Unwin Human Ltd. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[List of women philosophers|philosopher]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759–1797) is widely regarded as the pioneer of liberal feminism, with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) expanding the boundaries of liberalism to include women in the political structure of liberal society.&lt;ref&gt;Falco, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In her writings such as ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft commented on society's view of the woman and encouraged women to use their voices in making decisions separate from decisions previously made for them. Wollstonecraft "denied that women are, by nature, more pleasure seeking and pleasure giving than men. She reasoned that if they were confined to the same cages that trap women, men would develop the same flawed characters. What Wollstonecraft most wanted for women was personhood".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] was also an early proponent of feminism. In his article ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1861, published 1869), Mill attempted to prove that the legal subjugation of women is wrong and that it should give way to perfect equality.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill: critical assessments, Volume 4, By [[John Cunningham Wood]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S. (1869) [http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm ''The Subjection of Women''], Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that "until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they have been. What is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart (1869). The Subjection of Women (1869 first ed.). London: Longmans, Green, Reader &amp; Dyer. Retrieved 10 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same "genuine unselfishness" that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one "that motivates people to take into account the good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie 1989"/&gt; Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being. In his book ''The Subjection of Women'', Mill argues that three major parts of women's lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political/|title=Mill's Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Brink|first=David|date=9 October 2007|website=|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Equity feminism]] is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Feminism |first=Naomi |last=Black |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kDYqAAAAYAAJ |year=1989 |publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halfmann&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Q83kxhOsgxYC&amp;pg=PA79 |title=Industry and Politics in West Germany: Toward the Third Republic |editor-first=Peter J. |editor-last=Katzenstein |chapter=3.

=== Social liberal theory ===
{{main|Social liberalism}}
[[File:Jean Charles de Sismondi.png|thumb|upright|[[Sismondi]] in 1819 wrote the first critique of the free market from a liberal perspective]]
[[Jean Charles Léonard Simonde de Sismondi]]'s ''Nouveaux principes d'économie politique, ou de la richesse dans ses rapports avec la population'' (1819) represents the first comprehensive liberal critique of early capitalism and laissez-faire economics, and his writings, which were studied by [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]] among many others, had a profound influence on both liberal and socialist responses to the failures and contradictions of industrial society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Ross E. |title=Sismondi's Forgotten Ethical Critique of Early Capitalism |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=1984 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=227–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spiegel |first1=Henry William |title=The Growth of Economic Thought |date=1991 |publisher=Duke University Press |pages=302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gareth"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stedman Jones, Gareth |editor1-last=Aprile |editor1-first=Sylvie |editor2-last=Bensimon |editor2-first=Fabrice |title=La France et l'Angleterre au XIXe siècle.

The ideal of the [[Self-made man|self-made individual]], who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by [[industrialisation]] and ''laissez-faire'' capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although [[socialism]] later became a more important force for change and reform. Some [[Victorian literature|Victorian writers]], including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]], became early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref name="Richardson, pp. 36–37"&gt;Richardson, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. An equal right to liberty could not be established merely by ensuring that individuals did not physically interfere with each other, or merely by having laws that were impartially formulated and applied. More positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would have an [[equal opportunity]] of success.&lt;ref name='eatwell'&gt;{{cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' greatly influenced the course of 19th century liberalism]]
[[John Stuart Mill]] contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the new liberalism. Mill's 1859 ''[[On Liberty]]'' addressed the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart ''On Liberty'' Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave an impassioned defence of free speech, arguing that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. Mill defined "[[social liberty]]" as protection from "the tyranny of political rulers". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny and [[tyranny of the majority]], respectively. Social liberty meant limits on the ruler's power through obtaining recognition of political liberties or rights and by the establishment of a system of "[[constitutional]] checks".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart ''On Liberty'' Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

His definition of liberty, influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], was that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms others.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), "The Contest in America". Harper's New Monthly Magazine. Volume 24. Issue 143. pp. 683–684. Harper &amp; Bros. New York. April 1862.

Another early liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Seeing the effects of alcohol, he believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. P., "T. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation", ''History of Political Thought'', 6 (1985), 517–50. Reprinted in A. Vincent, ed., ''The Philosophy of T. H. Green'' (Aldershot: Gower, 1986), pp. 76–103&lt;/ref&gt; Green regarded the national state as legitimate only to the extent that it upholds a system of rights and obligations that is most likely to foster individual self-realisation.

The New Liberalism or social liberalism movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The New Liberals, which included intellectuals like L. T. Hobhouse and [[John A. Hobson]], saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favorable social and economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=0719060206|year=2001|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the poverty, squalor and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented and interventionist state.&lt;ref&gt;The Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; It supports a [[mixed economy]] that includes both [[public property|public]] and private property in [[capital good]]s.&lt;ref name="Stanislao G.

=== Anarcho-capitalist theory ===

[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1863) b 269.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julius Faucher]] (1820–1878)]]
[[Classical liberalism]] advocates [[free trade]] under the rule of law.  [[Anarcho-capitalism]] goes one step further, with law enforcement and the courts being provided by private companies.  Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism. One of the first liberals to discuss the possibility of [[privatizing]] protection of individual liberty and property was France's [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in the 18th century. Later in the 1840s, [[Julius Faucher]] and [[Gustave de Molinari]] advocated the same. In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari argued: "No government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity". Molinari and this new type of anti-state liberal grounded their reasoning on liberal ideals and classical economics. Historian and libertarian [[Ralph Raico]] argues that what these liberal philosophers "had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism, or, as it would be called today, anarcho-capitalism or market anarchism".&lt;ref&gt;Raico, Ralph (2004) [https://www.mises.org/story/1787 ''Authentic German Liberalism of the 19th century''] Ecole Polytechnique, [http://www.crea.polytechnique.fr/index.htm Centre de Recherce en Epistemologie Appliquee], Unité associée au CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the liberalism of Locke, which saw the state as evolving from society, the anti-state liberals saw a fundamental conflict between the voluntary interactions of people, i.e. society; and the institutions of force, i.e. the state. This society versus state idea was expressed in various ways: natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.&lt;ref name="Molinari-1849"&gt;Molinari, Gustave de (1849) [http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm The Production of Security] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QjP50k9o?url=http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm |date=31 July 2007 }} (trans. J. Huston McCulloch). Retrieved 15 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-state liberal tradition in Europe and the United States continued after Molinari in the early writings of [[Herbert Spencer]] as well as in thinkers such as [[Paul Émile de Puydt]] and [[Auberon Herbert]]. However, the first person to use the term anarcho-capitalism was [[Murray Rothbard]], who in the mid-20th century synthesized elements from the [[Austrian School]] of economics, classical liberalism and 19th-century American [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]] (while rejecting their [[labor theory of value]] and the norms they derived from it).&lt;ref&gt;"A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker." Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-631-17944-3}}, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favor of [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]], [[private property]] and [[free markets]]. Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of [[statute]] (law by [[decree]] or [[legislation]]), society would improve itself through the discipline of the free market (or what its proponents describe as a "[[voluntary society]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Morris |first=Andrew |authorlink= |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n8 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=13–14 |quote= |ref= |chapter=Anarcho-Capitalism |title= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stringham51&gt;Edward Stringham, ''Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nft4e62nicsC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=anarcho-capitalism+libertarian&amp;sa=X&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=anarcho-capitalism%20libertarian p. 51].&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anarcho-capitalist society, [[law enforcement]], [[court]]s and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors rather than centrally through [[taxation]]. [[Money]], along with all other [[goods and services]], would be [[free banking|privately and competitively provided]] in an [[open market]]. Therefore, personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would be regulated by victim-based [[dispute resolution organizations]] under [[tort]] and [[contract]] law, rather than by statute through centrally determined punishment under political monopolies.&lt;ref name="libertarianpapers"&gt;[http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2011/lp-3-3.pdf "Review of Kosanke's Instead of Politics – Don Stacy"] Libertarian Papers VOL. 3, ART.

[[File:John Locke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]] was the first to develop a liberal philosophy, including the [[Right to property|right to private property]] and the [[consent of the governed]]]]
Isolated strands of liberal thought had existed in [[Western philosophy]] since the [[Ancient Greeks]] and in [[Eastern philosophy]] since the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] period. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct ideology, by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.&lt;ref name="Delaney, p. 18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin et al., p. 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungCambridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fung|first1=Edmund S.

These ideas began to coalesce at the time of the [[English Civil War]]s. The [[Levellers]], a radical political movement, during the war called for [[Freedom of religion in the United Kingdom|freedom of religion]], frequent convening of parliament and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the [[Early modern Britain|17th century in England]], culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which enshrined [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the [[right of revolution]] and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc-uXxPXfmwC|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-15605-7 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several [[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] throughout the 18th century. Political tension between England and its [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] grew after 1765 and the [[Seven Years' War]] over the issue of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]], culminating in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of a new republic, and the resulting [[American Revolutionary War]] to defend it. After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The [[Articles of Confederation]], written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The [[United States in Congress Assembled|Confederation Congress]] called a [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new [[Constitution of the United States]] establishing a [[Federation|federal]] government. In the context of the times, the Constitution was a republican and liberal document.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Liberal Modernity and Its Adversaries: Freedom, Liberalism and Anti-Liberalism in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNlT9Qho0tAC|year=2007|publisher=Brill|pages=237–38|isbn=90-04-16052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the oldest liberal governing document in effect worldwide.

In Europe, liberalism has a long tradition dating back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;German songs like ''[[Die Gedanken sind frei]]'' (''Thoughts Are Free'') can be dated even centuries before that.&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution began in 1789. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the [[abolition of feudalism in France]] on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and privileges and restrictions as well as the passage of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon Meacham|title=Thomas Jefferson: President and Philosopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tvBMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131|year=2014|publisher=Random House|page=131|isbn=9780385387514}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French brought to Western Europe the liquidation of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], the liberalization of [[property law]]s, the end of [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], the abolition of [[guild]]s, the legalization of [[divorce]], the disintegration of [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghettos]], the collapse of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], the final end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the elimination of church courts and religious authority, the establishment of the [[metric system]] and equality under the law for all men.&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, pp. 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt; His most lasting achievement, the [[Napoleonic code|Civil Code]], served as "an object of emulation all over the globe",&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but it also perpetuated further discrimination against women under the banner of the "natural order".&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, pp. 98–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development into maturity of classical liberalism took place before and after the French Revolution in Britain.&lt;ref name="Vincent, pp. 29–30"/&gt; [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref name="Mills, pp. 63, 68"/&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"&gt;Mills, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[radicalism (historical)|radical liberal movement]] began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing natural rights and [[popular sovereignty]]. Radicals like [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|Latin America]], liberal unrest dates back to the 18th century, when liberal agitation in Latin America led to [[Latin American wars of independence|independence]] from the imperial power of Spain and Portugal. The new regimes were generally liberal in their political outlook and employed the philosophy of [[positivism]], which emphasized the truth of modern science, to buttress their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Ardao, "Assimilation and transformation of positivism in Latin America". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1963): 515–522. [http://pics3441.upmf-grenoble.fr/articles/cult/assimilation_and_transformation_of_positivism_in_latin_america.pdf Online]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212190612/http://pics3441.upmf-grenoble.fr/articles/cult/assimilation_and_transformation_of_positivism_in_latin_america.pdf|date=12 February 2015}}; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707981 also in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a [[American Civil War|vicious war]] ensured the integrity of the nation and the abolition of slavery in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) gave a major boost to the course of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

During 19th and early 20th century in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, liberalism influenced periods of reform such as the [[Tanzimat]] and [[Al-Nahda]]; the rise of secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism; and different intellectuals and religious group and movements, like the [[Young Ottomans]] and [[Islamic Modernism]]. Prominent of the era were [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]], [[Namık Kemal]] and [[İbrahim Şinasi]]. However, the reformist ideas and trends did not reach the common population successfully as the books, periodicals and newspapers were accessible primarily to intellectuals and segments of an emerging middle class while many [[Muslim]]s saw them as foreign influences on the [[Liberalism and progressivism in the Muslim world|world of Islam]]. That perception complicated reformist efforts made by Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref name="Abdelmoula"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abdelmoula|first1=Ezzeddine|title=Al Jazeera and Democratization: The Rise of the Arab Public Sphere|year=2015|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1317518470|pages=50–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vP7qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roderic.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|The iconic painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], a tableau of the [[July Revolution]] in 1830]]
[[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] and [[suffrage]] movements spread, along with representative and democratic ideals. France established an [[French Third Republic|enduring republic]] in the 1870s. However, nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in [[Liberalism and radicalism in Italy|Italy]] and Germany brought about the unification of the two countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy and ended the secular power of the Popes. However, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] launched a counter crusade against liberalism. [[Pope Pius IX]] issued the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]'' in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelling the Jesuit order]]. By the end of the nineteenth century, the principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged and the ideal of the self-made individual seemed increasingly implausible. Victorian writers like [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]] were early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref name="Richardson, pp. 36–37"/&gt;

Liberalism gained momentum in the beginning of the 20th century. The bastion of [[autocracy]], the [[Nicholas II|Russian Tsar]], was overthrown in the [[February Revolution|first phase]] of the [[Russian Revolution]]. The Allied victory in the [[First World War]] and the collapse of four empires seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism across the European continent, not just among the [[Allies of World War I|victorious allies]], but also in Germany and the newly created states of [[Eastern Europe]]. Militarism, as typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Blinkhorn argues, the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of "cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the [[League of Nations]]".

In the Middle East, liberalism led to constitutional periods, like the Ottoman [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First]] and [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] and the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Persian constitutional period]], but it declined in the late 1930s due the growth and opposition of [[Islamism]] and [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Arab nationalism|nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzman|first1=Charles|title=Liberal Islam: A Source Book|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195116224|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n8HSe9SfXMC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moaddel1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moaddel|first1=Mansoor|title=Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226533336|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk6BLopmn3gC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lapidus"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Islamic Societies |last=Lapidus |first=Ira Marvin |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521779332 |page=496 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&amp;pg=PA496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LorentzIran"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorentz|first1=John H.|title=The A to Z of Iran|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=1461731917|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV9WwxXbCB8C&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LindgrenRoss"/&gt; However, there were various examples of intellectuals who advocated liberal values and ideas.

In the United States, [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]] traces its history to the popular presidency of [[Franklin D.

The [[New Deal coalition]] established by Roosevelt left a decisive legacy and influenced many future American presidents, including [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alterman, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the definitive liberal response to the Great Depression was given by the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=0-415-13481-1|pages=96–100|publisher=London: routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide Great Depression, starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the rise of [[fascism]] as an ideology and a movement arrayed against both liberalism and [[communism]], especially in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, pp. 218–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of fascism in the 1930s eventually culminated in [[World War II]], the deadliest conflict in human history. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prevailed in the war by 1945 and their victory set the stage for the [[Cold War]] between the [[Communist state|Communist]] [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc]].

[[Liberalism in Iran|In Iran]], liberalism enjoyed wide popularity. In April 1951, the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] became the governing coalition when democratically elected [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], a liberal nationalist, took office as the [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]].

Among the various regional and national movements, the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States during the 1960s strongly highlighted the liberal efforts for [[Social equality|equal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie and Weisbrot, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Society]] project launched by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B.

[[File:Nizhny Novgorod. Anti-Corruption Rally (26 March 2017).jpg|thumb|[[2017 Russian protests]], organized by Russia's liberal opposition]]
The Cold War featured extensive ideological competition and several [[proxy war]]s, but the widely feared [[World War III]] between the Soviet Union and the United States never occurred. While communist states and liberal democracies competed against one another, an [[1973 oil crisis|economic crisis]] in the 1970s inspired a move away from [[Keynesian economics]], especially under [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States. This trend, called "[[neoliberalism]]" by its opponents, lasted through the 1980s and the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Meanwhile, nearing the end of the 20th century communist states in Eastern Europe [[Revolutions of 1989|collapsed precipitously]], leaving liberal democracies as the only major forms of government in the West.

At the beginning of World War II, the number of democracies around the world was about the same as it had been forty years before.&lt;ref&gt;Colomer, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945, liberal democracies spread very quickly, but then retreated. In ''The Spirit of Democracy'', Larry Diamond argues that by 1974 "dictatorship, not democracy, was the way of the world" and that "barely a quarter of independent states chose their governments through competitive, free, and fair elections". Diamond goes on to say that democracy bounced back and by 1995 the world was "predominantly democratic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Larry Diamond|title=The Spirit of Democracy: The Struggle to Build Free Societies Throughout the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vx3JTGSB5JcC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2008|publisher=Henry Holt|page=7|isbn=978-0-8050-7869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2016|publisher=Freedom House|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2016?gclid=COLduYD4ys4CFVUvgQodDPkNvw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism has drawn both criticism and support in its history from various ideological groups. Less friendly to the goals of liberalism has been [[conservatism]]. [[Edmund Burke]], considered by some to be the first major proponent of modern conservative thought, offered a blistering critique of the French Revolution by assailing the liberal pretensions to the power of rationality and to the natural equality of all humans.&lt;ref name="Grigsby, p. 108"&gt;Grigsby, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some confusion remains about the relationship between social liberalism and [[socialism]], despite the fact that many variants of socialism distinguish themselves markedly from liberalism by [[anti-capitalism|opposing capitalism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[private property]]. Socialism formed as a group of related yet divergent ideologies in the 19th century such as [[Christian socialism]], [[communism]] (with the writings of [[Karl Marx]]) and [[social anarchism]] (with the writings of [[Mikhail Bakunin]]), the latter two influenced by the [[Paris Commune]]. These ideologies—as with liberalism and conservatism—fractured into several major and minor movements in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, pp. 119–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx rejected the foundational aspects of liberal theory, hoping to destroy both the state and the liberal distinction between society and the individual while fusing the two into a collective whole designed to overthrow the developing capitalist order of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, socialist parties and ideas remain a political force with varying degrees of power and influence on all continents leading national governments in many countries.

[[Vladimir Lenin]] stated that—in contrast with [[Marxism]]—liberal science defends [[wage slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Selsam|first1=Howard|last2=Martel|first2=Harry|authorlink1=Howard Selsam|title=Reader in Marxist Philosophy|year=1963|publisher=[[International Publishers]]|isbn=0717801675|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoSQ6vD8fUC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenin|first1=Vladimir|authorlink1=Vladimir Lenin|title=On Culture and Cultural Revolution|date=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoSQ6vD8fUC&amp;pg=PA37|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=1434463524|page=34|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some proponents of liberalism like [[George Henry Evans]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Thomas Paine]] were critics of wage slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/history/paine4.html Social Security Online History Pages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Junius P.|authorlink1=Junius P.

In the same vein, conservatives have also attacked what they perceive to be the reckless liberal pursuit of progress and material gains, arguing that such preoccupations undermine traditional social values rooted in community and continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few variations of conservatism, like [[liberal conservativism]], expound some of the same ideas and principles championed by classical liberalism, including "small government and thriving capitalism".&lt;ref name="Grigsby, p. 108"/&gt;

[[Social democracy]], an ideology advocating progressive modification of [[capitalism]], emerged in the 20th century and was influenced by socialism. Broadly defined as a project that aims to correct through government reformism what it regards as the intrinsic defects of capitalism by reducing inequalities,&lt;ref&gt;Lightfoot, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; social democracy was also not against the state. Several commentators have noted strong similarities between social liberalism and social democracy, with one political scientist even calling American liberalism "bootleg social democracy" due to the absence of a significant social democratic tradition in the United States that liberals have tried to rectify.&lt;ref&gt;Susser, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Another movement associated with modern democracy, [[Christian democracy]], hopes to spread [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic social ideas]] and has gained a large following in some European nations.&lt;ref&gt;Riff, pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The early roots of Christian democracy developed as a reaction against the [[industrialisation]] and [[urbanisation]] associated with ''laissez-faire'' liberalism in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riff, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these complex relationships, some scholars have argued that liberalism actually "rejects ideological thinking" altogether, largely because such thinking could lead to unrealistic expectations for human society.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fascism and ideology#Liberalism|Fascists accuse liberalism]] of materialism and a lack of spiritual values.&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"&gt;Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R. Jacob. ''Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society – From 1600, Volume 2''. 9th ed. Boston, Massaschussetts: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 pp. 760.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"&gt;Sternhell, Zeev, Mario Sznajder and Maia Ashéri. ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness,&lt;ref name="massaschussetts1"/&gt; but many fascists agree with liberals in their support of [[private property rights]] and a [[market economy]].&lt;ref name="revolution1994"/&gt;

Scholars have praised the influence of liberal internationalism, claiming that the rise of [[globalisation]] "constitutes a triumph of the liberal vision that first appeared in the eighteenth century" while also writing that liberalism is "the only comprehensive and hopeful vision of world affairs".&lt;ref&gt;Venturelli, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24374">There are many proposed diseases and [[Medical_diagnosis|diagnoses]] that are rejected by orthodox medicine consensus and are associated with pseudoscience.

==Definition==

[[Pseudoscience]] rejects [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] methodology.&lt;ref name="Coker"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coker |first1=Rory |title=Distinguishing Science from Pseudoscience |url=https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~coker2/index.files/distinguish.htm |website=utexas.edu |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudoscientific diseases are not defined using objective criteria. They cannot achieve, and perhaps do not seek, medical recognition.

Other conditions may be rejected or contested by orthodox medicine, but are not necessarily associated with pseudoscience. Diagnostic criteria for some of these conditions may be vague, over-inclusive, or otherwise ill-defined. Although the evidence for the disease may be contested or lacking, however, the justification for these diagnoses is nevertheless empirical and therefore amenable to scientific investigation, at least in theory.

Examples of conditions that are not necessarily pseudoscientific include:
* Conditions determined to be [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] in nature, including [[mass psychogenic illness]]es. 
* [[Medicalization|Medicalized]] conditions that are not pathogenic in nature, such as [[aging]], [[childbirth]], [[pregnancy]], [[sexual addiction]],  [[baldness]], [[jet lag]], and [[halitosis]].&lt;ref name="Smith2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=R.|title=In search of "non-disease"|journal=BMJ|volume=324|issue=7342|year=2002|pages=883–885|issn=09598138|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.883}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conditions that are not widely recognized, about which there is an ongoing debate within the scientific and medical literature. 
* [[Functional disorder]]s are a set of conditions that cannot be explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities.&lt;ref name="BergerGieteling2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=M Y|last2=Gieteling|first2=M J|last3=Benninga|first3=M A|title=Chronic abdominal pain in children|journal=BMJ|volume=334|issue=7601|year=2007|pages=997–1002|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.39189.465718.BE}}&lt;/ref&gt; These raise challenges around diagnosis and treatment, with debate around whether they are psychogenic. They often present with [[Symptom#Non-specific symptoms|non-specific symptoms]] that are consistent with multiple causes. Examples include [[fibromyalgia]], [[myalgic encephalomyelitis]], and [[Gulf War syndrome]].
* Conditions that are recognized by the [[scientific consensus]], but are frequently [[Self-diagnosis|self-diagnosed]] or otherwise misapplied. Examples include various kinds of [[allergy]], including [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity]].

==Selecting a partner==
[[File:Burmese wedding procession.jpg|thumb|A wedding procession, with the groom and bride dressed in traditional Burmese wedding clothes, reminiscent of royal attire.]]
Most Burmese people find their own life partner, but sometimes they may have an [[arranged marriage]] conducted by their parents or a middleman. If the parents do not support the couple, they may get married in secret then after some time the parents might accept their marriage.
Traditionally, when a man goes to ask a woman’s parents to bless their marriage, he brings a gift to his future wife.
[[Polygyny]] is illegal in [[Myanmar]] however divorce is common. A couple who wants to divorce will divide their property.
After marriage, a couple may live with their in-laws for a short time or for a lifetime.
Household chores are carried out by women.&lt;ref name= "Facts and Details Myanmar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Myanmar/sub5_5c/entry-3041.html
|title= Facts and Details Myanmar|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
The first step to a proper engagement is for the bride and groom’s parents and chosen elders to be formally and publicly introduced at the bride’s home or a public venue. During that time, both sides will discuss the details of the wedding. However close they are, the families will formally negotiate about the wedding.&lt;ref name= "MM Times"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/171-wedding-bliss/8335-getting-married-in-myanmar-traditions-and-beliefs.html|title= Myanmar Times, Wedding Bliss|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wedding==
{{main|Weddings in Myanmar}}
Historically, marriages could be announced to the public by letting people from seven houses on either side of the wedded couple’s house know about it. Nowadays, people prefer to celebrate their wedding ceremony impressively among their community. Some couples sign the marriage certificate at a courthouse and some invite a judge to their home. Generally, monks are invited to home in rural areas. In metropolitan areas, families go monasteries. The couple offers food to the monks and listen to a sermon.&lt;ref name= "MM Times"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/171-wedding-bliss/8335-getting-married-in-myanmar-traditions-and-beliefs.html|title= Myanmar Times, Wedding Bliss|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Superstitions==
There are many superstitions regarding marriage in Myanmar. Tradition holds that those born on particular combinations of days of the week are not right for each other. For example: those born on Saturday would not be suitable for those born on Thursday. Likewise, Friday and Monday, Sunday and Wednesday, and Wednesday evening and Tuesday are all poor matches. If the couple is poorly matched, they will go to an astrologer and ask for help to avoid future difficulties. Astrologers also advise on the date and time of the ceremony, and the color of the wedding dress.
During the engagement celebration, the groom’s family offers coconut, banana, and pickled tea leaves on a tray to the bride’s family home for the household [[nat]] (spirit).
The best months to celebrate the wedding ceremony are April, May, June, October, November, and February. If a couple marries during these months, tradition holds that they will have a prosperous and long-lasting relationship. Couples try to avoid marrying during Buddhist Lent, from July to September.{{sfn|Nyo|2000|p=120-121}} 

==Finance==
Husbands are traditionally “rice winners”, however, wives manage the family income. Sometimes wives supplement their husband’s income by running a house-store, dress-making or selling something.  When a Burmese woman marries, she does not need to transfer her property to her husband. If a married woman divorces, she can keep what she has brought to the marriage. When a husband dies, everything he owns goes to his wife. Only after she passes away does the property go to the children.&lt;ref name= "MM Times"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/171-wedding-bliss/8335-getting-married-in-myanmar-traditions-and-beliefs.html|title= Myanmar Times, Wedding Bliss|accessdate=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spirits known by this term represented the souls of girls who had died unnatural tragic or premature deaths, particularly unchristened babies.&lt;ref name="Mavka Grinczenko"/&gt; Mavkas often appear in the form of beautiful young girls who entice and lure young men into the woods, where they "tickle" them to death.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Mavkas have no reflection in water, do not cast shadows, and have "no back" (those are more often called "Nyavka" and they are believed to live in [[Western Ukraine]], that has more dangerous mountain rivers than [[Central Ukraine]], while Mavkas, who are believed to live in Central Ukraine, have their backs.), and so their insides can be seen. In some accounts, they were also said to help farmers by looking after cattle and driving out wild animals.

They were believed to live in groups in forests, mountain caves, or sheds, which they decorated with rugs. They made thread of stolen flax and wove thin transparent cloth for making clothes for themselves. They loved flowers, which they wore in their hair. In the spring they planted flowers in the mountains, to which they enticed young men, whom they tickled to death. On [[Pentecost]] (known as Mavka's Easter, {{lang-uk|На́вський Вели́кдень}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrinchenko.com/slovar/znachenie-slova/29878-navskyj.html Словарь української мови / Упор. з дод. влас. матеріалу Б. Грінченко : в 4-х т. — К. : Вид-во Академії наук Української РСР, 1958. Том 2, ст. 474.]&lt;/ref&gt; they held games, dances, and orgies. A [[demon]] accompanied them on a [[flute]] or [[Pipe (instrument)|pipes]]. 

To save a dead unchristened baby's soul, one had to throw up a kerchief during [[Pentecost]] holidays, say a name and add "I baptise you". A rescued soul would then go to [[heaven]]. If a soul lived up to seven years and did not go to heaven, a baby would turn into a mavka and would haunt people.

It is believed that the first mavka (or [[Rusalka|rusalka]]) was [[Kostroma (deity)|Kostroma]], when she discovered that her newlywed husband [[Kupala|Kupalo]] is her brother and they cannot be together{{sfn|Buynova Tatyana Yuryevna|2008|p=256}}. According to the legend, Kostroma and Kupalo once ran into a field to listen to songs of bird [[Sirin]], but Sirin stole Kupalo and carried him into the [[Nav (Slavic folklore)|Nav]]. Many years later, one day, Kostroma walked the shore of the river and made a wreath. She boasted that the wind would not blow wreath off her head. According to the belief, it meant that she would not marry. This boast was not approved by the gods. The wind become stronger, and the wreath was blown by the wind from Kostroma's head and fell into the water, where it was picked up by the Kupalo, who was near by in the boat. According to the Slavic customs, the one who picked up the wreath must necessarily marry the girl who made it. Kupalo and Kostroma fell in love, and shortly after were married without any knowledge that they were brother and sister.
After the wedding, the gods told them the truth. That is why Kupalo and Kostroma committed [[suicide]]. Kupalo jumped into the fire and died, while Kostroma ran to the forest, threw herself into the forest lake and drowned. But she did not die, she became a mavka. Since then, she walks the shores of that lake. If she should see a young man, she immediately [[Seduction|seduces]] him and pulls him into the water [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]. When Mavka realises that the young man is not her lover, it is already too late and the young man has already drowned{{sfn|Buynova Tatyana Yuryevna|2008|p=256}}.

And then, the gods repented, realizing that their revenge was too cruel. But to give Kupala and Kostroma again the human body was impossible, and they turned them into the yellow-blue flower, in which the fiery yellow color was the color of Kupala, and the blue one, like the waters of a forest lake, was the color of Kostroma. The Slavs gave the name Kupalo-da-Mavka to the flower. Later, in the time of the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], the flower was renamed to the [[:ru:Иван-да-марья|Ivan-da-Marya]]{{sfn|Buynova Tatyana Yuryevna|2008|p=256}}.

Mavkas are depicted in literature, most notably in [[Lesia Ukrainka]]'s ''[[The Forest Song]]'' and [[Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky]]'s ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]''.

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication
medium evaluation and selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.
[[File:Interactive.png|thumb|left|alt=An Interactive Model of Communication.|The Interactive Model.]]
*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

'''Mother Ludlam's Cave''', also known as '''Mother Ludlum's Cave''' or '''Mother Ludlum's Hole''', is a small cave in the sandstone cliff of the [[River Wey|Wey Valley]] at [[Moor Park, Farnham|Moor Park]], near [[Farnham]], [[Surrey]], in [[England]]. The cave is the subject of a number of local legends. A [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] rising in the cave is recorded in the 13th century "Annals of Waverley Abbey" as "Ludewell"; other spellings through history include "Ludwell" and "Luddwelle". A monk named Symon is credited with identifying the spring as a suitable water supply for [[Waverley Abbey]] in 1218, after the original source had dried up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers of the abbey dedicated the spring to St Mary, so it also became known as St Mary's Well. The cave has been naturally formed by the spring but may have been enlarged by the monks and was made into a [[grotto]] (possibly during the eighteenth century) and further enhanced by addition of an [[ironstone]] arched entrance, possibly during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]].

The cave was explored and surveyed at around 200 feet long in 1945&lt;ref&gt;Mother Ludlam’s Hole, Farnham. John Hooper, The British Caver No.14, pp.63-70&lt;/ref&gt; and as 192 feet to a recent roof collapse in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;The Moor Park sandstone caves, Maurice Hewins, Wessex Cave Club Journal No.82,pp.323-326&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the name==

According to the information panel erected at the cave by [[Waverley, Surrey|Waverley Borough Council]] the name Ludwell can be traced back to the [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and means "bubbling spring".&lt;ref&gt;The only other Ludwell listed in ''John Bartholomew's Gazetteer of the British Isles'' (1887) and ''John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England &amp; Wales'' (1872) is a hamlet, Ludwell, Wiltshire.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Aubrey]] visited the area in 1673 and was informed that Ludwell was named after Lud, King of the [[South Saxons]], who went there to bathe his wounds after a battle.  A story originating with the Norman-Welsh writer of historicised legends [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] has [[Lud son of Heli|Ludd, Lud or Llud]] as the ruler of Celtic Britain and founder of London. A modern ethnographer would identify Lud as a Celtic god: a temple dedicated to him once stood in London near eponymous [[Ludgate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are numerous toponyms in England and a very few in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/match_head_by_any.jsp?flag=1&amp;f_type=&amp;#91;NULL&amp;#93;&amp;ft_lev=0&amp;st=HW&amp;start=0 Vision of Britain: gazetteer searches "Lud-".]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known as the Celtic god of healing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus Celtic-speaking people must have known of the spring but whether they considered it a sacred spring long before the monks of nearby [[Waverley Abbey]] used it as a source of fresh water and rededicated it to St Mary (the Holy Mother) is unknown. The "Lud" element of the name is maintained in the latest adaptation, "Mother Ludlam".

==The legend of Mother Ludlam, the White Witch of Waverley==
[[File:Mother Ludlam's Cauldron 1.jpg|thumb|Mother Ludlam's Cauldron in Frensham church]]
The cave has long been associated with the [[legend]] of "Mother Ludlam" who was, supposedly, a [[white witch]] who lived in the cave. The earliest versions of the legend, such as that recorded by [[John Aubrey]] in 1673 in his ''Natural History and Antiquities of Surrey'', make no mention of a witch and it is likely that the story was originally associated with [[fairies]].&lt;ref&gt;Westwood &amp; Simpson 2005, p.718. Alexander 1986, 2003, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various versions of the legend have existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.weyriver.co.uk/theriver/people_2_legends.htm
 | title = Wey Legends &amp; Other Stories
 | accessdate = 2008-04-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest version is that Mother Ludlam would loan utensils and that a large cauldron was borrowed but not returned; she became enraged and the borrower, scared by her anger, sought refuge in [[Frensham]] Church. The cauldron associated with this legend remains in the church to this day, but is believed by historians to have been used for brewing church ale in past times &amp;ndash; made of hammered copper and measuring three feet in diameter and 19&amp;nbsp;inches deep, it is of the type that was commonly used in the Middle Ages for catering at parishioners' weddings and religious festivals.

As recorded in 1937 the legend is that one day the [[Devil]], in disguise, had visited Mother Ludlam and asked to borrow the cauldron she used for mixing her potions. Recognising the Devil from his hoof-prints in the sand, she refused, so the Devil stole the cauldron, with the witch in pursuit. Making great leaps, the Devil created a series of hills where he touched the ground, these now being the sandstone hills near [[Churt]], known as the [[Devil's Jumps, Churt|Devil's Jumps]]. The Devil dropped the cauldron &amp;ndash; or kettle &amp;ndash; on the last of these hills, "Kettle Bury", or "Kettlebury Hill". Mother Ludlam recovered the cauldron and placed it in Frensham Church, where it would be safe from the Devil.

Another version, recorded in the 1920s, is that the cauldron could be borrowed by climbing the highest of the Devil's Jumps (known as Stony Jump), and whispering to the fairies who lived there through a hole in the rocky outcrop on the summit. A borrower failed to return it on time, so the fairies condemned the borrower to have the cauldron follow him wherever he went. Distressed by the presence of his pursuer, he sought sanctuary in Frensham Church where he collapsed and died, leaving the cauldron trapped inside.

==William Cobbett==
[[File:Mother Ludlam's Cave 1785.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The cave in an engraving, published in 1785, showing how it looked at the time of [[Francis Grose]]'s visit, as described by William Cobbett]]
[[William Cobbett]] wrote of the cave in his ''[[Rural Rides]]'', recounting his visit of 27 October 1825:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From Waverley we went to [[Moor Park, Farnham|Moore Park]], once the seat of Sir William Temple, and, when I was a very little boy, the seat of a lady or a Mrs Temple. Here I showed Richard "Mother Ludlum's Hole"; but, alas! it is not the enchanting place that I knew it, nor that which [[Francis Grose|Grose]] describes in his Antiquities! The semicircular paling is gone; the basins to catch the never-ceasing little stream are gone; the iron cups, fastened by chains, for people to drink out of, are gone; the pavement all broken to pieces; the seats, for people to sit on, on both sides of the cave, torn up, and gone; the stream that ran down a clean paved channel, now making a dirty gutter; and the ground opposite, which was a grove, chiefly of laurels, intersected by {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}mowed grass walks, now become a poor ragged-looking alder-coppice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Cobbett |authorlink=William Cobbett |title=Rural Rides |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34238/34238-h/34238-h.htm#Page_265 |chapter=Oct. 23rd to 27th, 1825: Chilworth to Winchester |date=1825 |page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cave is now in an even more dire state of repair following collapse of part of its roof during the [[drought]] of 1976, which also affected the floor of the cave by covering the remaining signs of habitation with a large mound of sand.

==Wildlife==
[[File:Plecotus auritus 01.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Long-eared Bat]]
The cave provides a roost for a variety of bat species: [[Natterer's bat|Natterer's Bat]] (''Myotis nattereri''), [[Daubenton's Bat]] (''M. daubentonii'') and [[Brown long-eared bat|Long-eared Bat]] (''Plecotus auritus'') exist in some numbers. Conservation efforts are now encouraging a return of the [[Greater Horseshoe Bat]] (''Rhinolophus ferrumequinum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Father Foote's Cave==
[[File:Father Footes Cave.jpg|thumb|right|Father Foote's Cave]]
Above Mother Ludlam's Cave is another, smaller, cave known as Father Foote's Cave, which is the subject of another story.  A man named Foote allegedly dug the cave&lt;ref&gt;Licensed Farnham by Jean Parratt (Pollyphonics, reprinted 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and took shelter here, having previously stayed at the Seven Stars inn in Farnham for a while. He was found lying, unwell, one day by the stream. He was taken to Farnham [[workhouse]], where he died the same day in 1840. His last words were "Take me to the cave again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''music school''' is an educational [[institution]] specialized in the study, training, and research of music. Such an institution can also be known as a '''school of music''', '''music academy''', '''music faculty''', '''college of music''', '''music department''' (of a larger institution), '''conservatory''' or '''conservatoire'''. Instruction consists of training in the performance of [[musical instruments]], singing, [[musical composition]], conducting,  [[musicianship]], as well as academic and research fields such as [[musicology]], [[music history]] and [[music theory]].

[[Music instruction]] can be provided within the compulsory general education system, or within specialized children's music schools such as the [[Purcell School]]. Elementary-school children can access music instruction also in after-school institutions such as music academies or music schools. In Venezuela [[El Sistema]] of youth orchestras provides free after-school instrumental instruction through music schools called ''núcleos''.
The term “music school” can also be applied to institutions of higher education under names such as ''school of music'', such as the [[Jacobs School of Music]] of Indiana University; ''music academy'', like the [[Sibelius Academy]] or the [[Royal Academy of Music]], London; ''music faculty'' as the Don Wright Faculty of Music of the [[University of Western Ontario]]; ''college of music'', characterized by the [[Royal College of Music]]  and the [[Berklee College of Music]]; ''music department'', like the Department of Music at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; or the term ''conservatory'', exemplified by the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. In other parts of Europe, the equivalents of ''higher school of music'' or ''university of music'' may be used, such as the [[Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln]] (Cologne University of Music).

==History==
[[File:NotreDameDeParis.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Based around the Notre Dame Cathedral, the [[Notre Dame School]] was an important centre of polyphonic music.]]
Although music and music education may have been in existence for thousands of years, the earliest history is speculative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vYQEakqM4I0C&amp;printsec=frontcover The origins of music Nils Lennart Wallin, Steven Brown, Björn Merker] {{ISBN|0-262-73143-6}} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Even when history starts to be recorded, music is mentioned more frequently than music education. Within the biblical tradition, Hebrew litany was accompanied with rich music, but the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch was silent on the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. However, by [[Books of Samuel|I Samuel]] 10, Alfred Sendrey suggests that we find “a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation.” This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet [[Samuel]] was the patriarch of a school which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html Lee Krähenbühl: A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[schola cantorum (papal choir)]] in Rome may be the first recorded music school in history, when [[Gregory the Great]] (540–604) made permanent an existing guild dating from the 4th century (''schola'' originally referred more to a guild rather than school). The school consisted of monks, secular clergy, and boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sistine_Choir Original ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Sistine Choir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232840/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sistine_Choir |date=25 July 2011 }} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wells Cathedral School]], England founded as a Cathedral School in 909 a.d. to educate choristers, continues today to educate choristers and teaches instrumentalists. However the school appears to have been refounded at least once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellscathedralschool.org/wells/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=170&amp;Itemid=181&amp;ed=1 Wells Cathedral School] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Martial school]], 10th to 12th century, was an important school of composition at the [[Abbey of Saint Martial]], [[Limoges]]. It is known for the composition of [[trope (music)|trope]]s, [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]]s, and early [[organum]]. In this respect, it was an important precursor to the [[Notre Dame School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TMdf1SioFk4C&amp;pg=PA748&amp;lpg=PA748&amp;dq=Saint+Martial+school+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1HwZru3T3e&amp;sig=OyZMEyDOXAnc-fTxwfjhFKfO-T4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1E7YTLGkMZOKhQfMwP32Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Saint%20Martial%20school%20music&amp;f=false Harvard Dictionary of Music: St Martial school] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Notre Dame school (late 12th and early 13th century) which was the earliest repertory of [[polyphonic]] (multipart) music to gain international prestige and circulation. The school was a group of composers and singers working under the patronage of the great Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|420777|Notre Dame School}}. retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  First records on [[Escolania de Montserrat]], boys' choir linked to a music school, back to 1307 and still continues the musical education.

The [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] (National Academy of St Cecilia) is one of the oldest musical institutions in the world, based in Italy.
It is based at the Auditorium [[Parco della Musica]] in [[Rome]], and was founded by the papal bull, Ratione congruit, issued by Sixtus V in 1585, which invoked two saints prominent in Western musical history: Gregory the Great, for whom the Gregorian chant is named, and Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music.
It was founded as a "congregation" or "confraternity" – a religious guild, so to speak – and over the centuries, has grown from a forum for local musicians and composers to an internationally acclaimed academy active in music scholarship (with 100 prominent music scholars forming the body of the Accademia) to music education (in its role as a conservatory) to performance (with an active choir and symphony orchestra).

The term ''conservatory'' has its origin in 16th-century [[Renaissance]] Italy, where orphanages (''[[wikt:conservatorio|conservatori]]'') were attached to hospitals. The orphans (''conservati'' ‘saved’) were given a musical education there, and the term gradually applied to music schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|133512|Conservatory}}. Retrieved 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|conservatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hospitals-conservatories were among the first secular institutions equipped for practical training in music. By the 18th century, Italian conservatories were already playing a major role in the training of artists and composers.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1979"&gt;''[[The Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of [[Naples]], a ''conservatorio'' was strictly a secular place for teaching and learning specializing in music education. There were already four [[conservatories in Naples]] active in the 17th and 18th century: 
* ''I poveri di Gesù Cristo'' (‘The Paupers of Jesus Christ’), founded in 1599 by Marcello Fossataro, already included in their official record a ''magister musicæ'' and ''magister [[lyre|lyræ]]'' in 1633; 
* ''Santa Maria di Loreto'', where the composer [[Giovan Battista Pergolesi]] (1710–1736) studied; 
* ''La pietà dei turchini'' was founded in 1583 and the earliest findings suggest musical activity around the year 1615;
* ''Sant'Onofrio a porta Capuana'', where the composer [[Giovanni Paisiello]] (1740–1816) studied and then taught, started teaching music in the mid-1600 and in the following decades will give more priority to the [[opera buffa]];
* plus one only for girls called ''dell'Annunziata''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Della Corte, G. M. Gatti, ''Dizionario di musica'', Paravia, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is in these very institutions that the so-called [[Neapolitan School|''Scuola Musicale Napoletana'']] was developed, thanks to the work of musicians and educators like [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] (1660–1725) and [[Francesco Durante]] (1684–1755), who was also Pergolesi’s and Paisiello’s teacher.

It was the example set in Naples, where admission was by competitive examination and tuition was free, that was then copied, with modifications, in many European cities, including Paris (1795), Bologna (1804), Milan (1807), Florence and Prague (1811), Warsaw and Vienna (1821), London (1822), the Hague (1826), and Liege (1827). The second half of the 19th century saw the network expanding to the Americas, Rio de Janeiro (1847), Boston (1853), Baltimore and Chicago (1868), Havana (1885), and Buenos Aires (1893). Establishments for advanced training in music were organized in the 1940s in several Asian and African countries, including Iraq, Lebanon, and Kenya.&lt;ref name="The Great Soviet Encyclopedia 1979"/&gt;

To this extent, projects like [[El Sistema]] are more in line with the tradition set in Italy (where tuition at conservatories remains still free) than in an English-speaking country, where students have a very selective access to [[bursaries]] (see the [[Royal Academy of Music]] or the [[Royal College of Music]] in the UK).

Specialist music schools exist in many countries and whose purpose is to identify, and assist, children with exceptional potential, to benefit from world-class specialist training as part of a broad and balanced education, which will enable them, if they choose, to proceed towards self-sustaining careers in music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.areteacademy.org/ Arete Music Academy] retrieved Aug 29th 2018&lt;/ref&gt; These schools may be formally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landesmusikgymnasium.de/ Sächsisches Landesgymnasium für Musik "Carl Maria von Weber] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or informally attached to a conservatory.  Entry is typically between the ages of ages 8 and 18 and admission is through competitive audition.
Schools may be public or independent; where schools are independent, pupils may be in receipt of governmental&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/questions.shtml English Aided Pupil Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226141532/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/mds/questions.shtml |date=26 December 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or private scholarships. Typically as students progress through the school the time spent on music increases and on academic subjects decrease. These schools usually teach only instrumentalists but may also include choristers.

Some schools (like conservatories) are broader and may cover the [[performing arts]]: music, drama, dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laguardiahs.org/home.html Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710011008/http://laguardiahs.org/home.html |date=10 July 2012 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music schools within schools===
Many music schools are located within existing schools. The pattern is quite diverse and may include:

Specialist music units in Scotland, where students are drawn from an area wider than the host schools catchment. Students will receive specialist music tuition within the music school but are fully integrated within the host school for other lessons. Entry to the specialist music unit or school is by competitive audition, which also effectively gives entry to the host school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicplockton.org/ Sgoil Chiùil na Gàidhealtachd] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public or independent schools contain ''music departments'', some of which achieve high standards. These are sometimes referred to as Music schools. ''Music Colleges'' in England are schools that get additional private and governmental money to specialise in music. Entry is to the host school and musical ability is not an admission requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guildfordcounty.co.uk/music Guildford County School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904033911/http://www.guildfordcounty.co.uk/music |date=4 September 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Schools which perform highly may specialise in an additional area for example sports or technology.

Music schools also frequently operate from church facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cit web |URL=https://angelesacademyofmusic.com/ |title= |publisher=Angeles academy of music.com |accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-college divisions===
Many conservatories or other tertiary-level institutions have pre-college divisions or junior departments for children of school age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmnyc.edu/precollege/ Manhattan School of  Music Pre-college Division] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the curriculum includes individual lesson(s), orchestra, [[chamber music]], [[music theory|theory]], [[musicianship]], [[Musical composition|composition]] and [[music technology]]. Classes are usually held on a Saturday and children attend normal schools during the week.

===Music schools outwith the general education system===
Non-governmental&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikschule-froehlich.de/index.php/ Musik Fröhlich] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or private&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.yamaha.com/sp/music_education/music_school/ Yamaha Music Schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231210029/http://uk.yamaha.com/sp/music_education/music_school/ |date=31 December 2010 }} retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; schools of music offer music education outside the general education system for students aged 4 to 20+ years. In general, students attend these schools weekend or evening. These schools are typically provided by individuals, charitable or commercial organizations.

==Tertiary education==

===Conservatory===

[[File:JacobsSchoolofMusic.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Jacobs School of Music]], part of [[Indiana University]], has more than 1,600 students]]
A conservatory of music may also be known in English as ''conservatoire'' (chiefly in England&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|conservatoire}} ‘The French form of the word [...] is even sometimes assumed as the name of musical schools in England. In the U.S. the anglicized form ''conservatory'' is used.’&lt;/ref&gt;), ''conservatorium'' (in Australia&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition'': ‘''conservatorium'': (Austral.) the usual term for conservatoire’&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster’s ''Third Unabridged Dictionary'': ‘Origin of ''conservatorium'': German ''Konservatorium''’&lt;/ref&gt;), ''academy'' or ''college''. Some schools or conservatories are exclusively focused on music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ram.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx Royal Academy of Music] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Others have a wider focus, for example covering music, drama and dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juilliard.edu/ Juilliard] retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatories are suitable for students who wish to develop their performance, conducting, or composition to a professional standard. Typically, they offer a high percentage of practical training combined with academic study and professional development  for those considering a career in the creative arts. Individual teaching is the strength of most components.

Students have the opportunity to perform, conduct or have their music played on a regular basis, both informally and in public.
This may be solo or as part of an orchestra, ensemble or band. Typically, conservatories focus on Western classical music. However, some schools focus on traditional instruments for example [[Chinese instrument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccmusic.edu.cn/ywwz/index.htm China Conservatory] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Others may have departments for [[traditional music]] which includes both traditional and classical instruments, for example [[bagpipes]] alongside the [[fiddle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsamd.ac.uk/undergraduate/sm/ Royal Scottish Academy for Music and Drama] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120915045605/http://www.rsamd.ac.uk/undergraduate/sm/ |date=15 September 2012 }} retrieved 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, students can focus on [[jazz]], [[world music]] or pop music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahk.nl/en/conservatorium Conservatorium van Amsterdam] retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The time required to complete music degrees is generally not much different from degrees in other fields, i.e. 3–4 years for a [[Bachelor of Music]] degree, 1–2 years for a [[Master of Music]] degree, and 3–5 years for a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] or [[Doctor of Music]] Degree. A PhD degree can be gained for areas such as [[musicology]], [[music theory]], [[music composition]], [[music education]], or [[music therapy]].  Some schools may offer a non-academic degree that is solely performance based, such as the (United States) A.D. or Artist Diploma; this may be offered at the undergraduate and/or graduate level.

===University schools of music===

[[File:The Kohl Building.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]] shares its campus with [[Oberlin College]].]]
University music departments originally placed more emphasis on academic study of music, rather than performance. However, today, the division may not be so rigid, with many often placing greater emphasis on performance now than they did in the past. The specific balance of vocational training and academic study varies from one institution to another, and from one country to another.
Some countries separately define their institutions between university status and [[vocational university]] status, whilst other countries do not define such a rigid division. In addition to offering degrees similar to those offered at conservatories, some universities offer non-professional music-related degrees such as a Bachelor of Arts in Music or a Bachelor of Arts in Music Education. A number of previously independent conservatories have become affiliated to universities

The '''Order of the National Hero''' is the highest [[Commonwealth realms orders and decorations|honour]] awarded by the government of [[Belize]]. The Order of the National Hero is given for "extraordinary and outstanding achievement and merit in service to Belize or to humanity at large." Unlike the lower [[Order of Belize]] which can be awarded to foreign dignitaries, only Belizean citizens are eligible for the Order of the National Hero.

The order was instituted on 16 August 1991. As of 2014 the Order of the National Hero has been awarded three times, twice posthumously.&lt;ref name="caribbean"&gt;[http://www.caribbeanelections.com/knowledge/biography/heroes/bz_heroes.asp National Heroes of Belize], Caribbean Elections.

In the 19th century the placing of spectacular antiquities in the new museums brought unusual interest from the general public to Oriental studies.]]
'''Oriental studies''' is the academic field of study that embraces [[Near East]]ern and [[Far East]]ern societies and cultures, languages, peoples, history and archaeology; in recent years the subject has often been turned into the newer terms of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]]. Traditional Oriental studies in Europe is today generally focused on the discipline of [[Islamic studies]], while the study of China, especially traditional China, is often called [[Sinology]]. The study of [[East Asia]] in general, especially in the United States, is often called [[East Asian studies]], while the study of [[Israel]] and [[Jews]] are called [[Israel studies]] and [[Jewish studies]] respectively, although they are often considered the same field.

European study of the region formerly known as "the [[Orient]]" had primarily religious origins, which has remained an important motivation until recent times. Learning from Arabic medicine and philosophy, and the Greek translations from Arabic, was an important factor in the Middle Ages. Linguistic knowledge preceded a wider study of cultures and history, and as Europe began to encroach upon the region, political and economic factors encouraged growth in academic study. From the late 18th century archaeology became a link from the discipline to a wide European public, as treasures brought back filled new European museums. The modern study was influenced both by [[Imperialism|imperialist]] attitudes and interests, and also the sometimes naive fascination of the exotic East for Mediterranean and European writers and thinkers, captured in images by artists, that is embodied in a repeatedly-surfacing theme in the [[history of ideas]] in the West, called "[[Orientalism]]". In the last century, scholars from the region itself have participated on equal terms in the discipline.

== History of Oriental studies ==

=== Pre-Islam ===
The original distinction between the "West" and the "East" was crystallized in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] of the 5th century BC, when [[Athens|Athenian]] historians made a distinction between their "[[Athenian democracy]]" and the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] monarchy. An institutional distinction between East and West did not exist as a defined polarity before the ''Oriens-'' and ''Occidens''-divided administration of the Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s [[Roman Empire]] at the end of the 3rd century AD, and the division of the Empire into [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking portions. The classical world had intimate knowledge of their [[Ancient Persia]]n neighbours (and usually enemies), but very [[Sino-Roman relations|imprecise]] knowledge of most of the world further East, including the "[[Seres]]" (Chinese). However, there was substantial direct [[Roman trade with India]] (unlike with China) in the Imperial period.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:HaytonRemittingHisReportToThePope.JPG|left|thumb|[[Hayton of Corycus]] remitting his report on the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], to [[Pope Clement V]], in 1307.]]
The [[Spread of Islam|rise of Islam]] and [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century established a sharp opposition, or even a sense of polarity, between medieval European [[Christendom]] and the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] (which stretched from the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] to [[North Africa]] and [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]]). During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Muslim]]s and [[Jew]]s were considered the "alien" enemies of Christendom. Popular medieval European knowledge of cultures farther to the East was poor, dependent on the wildly fictionalized travels of Sir [[John Mandeville]] and legends of [[Prester John]], although the equally famous, and much longer, account by [[Marco Polo]] was a good deal more accurate.

Scholarly work was initially very largely linguistic in nature, with primarily a religious focus on understanding both [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]] and languages like [[Syriac language|Syriac]] with early Christian literature, but also from a wish to understand [[Arabic language|Arabic]] works on [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Islamic science|science]]. This effort, also called the ''[[Studia Linguarum]]'' existed sporadically throughout the Middle Ages, and the "[[Renaissance of the 12th century]]" witnessed a particular [[Latin translations of the 12th century|growth in translations]] of Arabic texts into Latin, with figures like [[Constantine the African]], who translated 37 books, mostly medical texts, from Arabic to Latin, and [[Herman of Carinthia]], one of the translators of the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete|earliest translation]] of the Qur'an into [[Latin]] was completed in 1143, although little use was made of it until it was printed in 1543, after which it was translated into other European languages. [[Gerard of Cremona]] and others based themselves in [[Al-Andaluz]] to take advantage of the Arabic libraries and scholars there. Later, with the Christian [[Reconquista]] in full progress, such contacts became rarer in Spain. Chairs of Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic were briefly established at Oxford, and four other universities following the [[Council of Vienne]] (1312).&lt;ref&gt;''Hebrew to Latin, Latin to Hebrew: the mirroring of two cultures'' 2006 Page 75 Giulio Busi, Freie Universität Berlin. Institut für Judaistik - 2006 "According to the famous decision of the council of Vienne (1311–1312), Oxford was chosen as one of four universities (with Paris, Bologna and Salamanca) where Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Aramaic were to be taught."&lt;/ref&gt;

There was [[Chronology of European exploration of Asia|vague but increasing]] knowledge of the complex civilizations in [[China]] and [[History of India|India]], from which luxury goods (notably [[cotton]] and [[silk]] textiles as well as [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]]) were imported. Although the [[Crusades]] produced relatively little in the way of scholarly interchange, the eruption of the [[Mongol Empire]] had strategic implications for both the [[Crusader kingdoms]] and Europe itself, and led to [[Franco-Mongol alliance|extended diplomatic contacts]]. From the [[Age of Exploration]], European interest in [[Cartography of Asia|mapping Asia]], and especially the sea-routes, became intense, though mostly pursued outside the universities.

=== Renaissance to 1800 ===
{{Unreferenced section|date= July 2017}}
[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (徐光啟) (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' (幾何原本) published in 1607.]]
University Oriental studies became systematic during the Renaissance, with the linguistic and religious aspects initially continuing to dominate. There was also a political dimension, as translations for diplomatic purposes were needed, even before the West engaged actively with the East beyond the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A landmark was the publication in Spain in 1514 of the first [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Polyglot Bible]], containing the complete existing texts in [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]], in addition to Greek and Latin. At [[Cambridge University]] there has been a [[Regius Professor of Hebrew (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Hebrew]] since 1540 (the fifth oldest regular chair there), and the [[Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic|chair in Arabic]] was founded in about 1643. Oxford followed for Hebrew in 1546 (both chairs were established by Henry VIII). Distinguished scholars included [[Edmund Castell]], who published his ''Lexicon Heptaglotton Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum, Arabicum, et Persicum'' in 1669, whilst some scholars like [[Edward Pococke]] had travelled to the East and wrote also on the modern history and society of Eastern peoples. The [[University of Salamanca]] had Professors of Oriental Languages from at least the 1570s. In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] initiated a training programme for "Les Jeunes de langues", young linguists with the diplomatic service, like [[François Pétis de la Croix]], who like his father and his son served as Arabic interpreter to the King. Study of the [[Far East]] was pioneered by missionaries, especially [[Matteo Ricci]] and others in the [[Jesuit China missions]], and missionary motives were to remain important, at least in linguistic studies.

During the 18th century Western scholars reached a reasonable basic level of understanding of the geography and most of the history of the region, though knowledge of the areas least accessible to Western travellers, like [[Japan]] and [[Tibet]], and their languages, remained limited. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers characterized aspects of the pagan East as superior to the Christian West, in [[Montesquieu]]'s ''Lettres Persanes'' or [[Voltaire]]'s ironic promotion of [[Zoroastrianism]]; others, like [[Edward Gibbon]], praised the relative religious tolerance of the Middle East as opposed to the intolerant Christian West, and many, including [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], the high social status of scholarship in [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]] China.
The [[Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale"]] (English: University of Naples "L'Orientale"), founded in Naples, Italy, in 1732, is the oldest school of Sinology and Oriental Studies of the European continent.

The end of the century saw the beginnings in the great increase in study of the [[archaeology]] of the period, which was to be an ever-more important aspect of the field through the next century. [[Egyptology]] led the way, and as with many other ancient cultures, provided the linguists with new material for decipherment and study.

=== Nineteenth century ===

With a great increase in knowledge of Asia among Western specialists, increasing political and economic involvement in the region, and in particular the realization of the existence of [[Indo-European languages|close relations between Indian and European languages]], by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], there emerged more complex intellectual connections between the early history of Eastern and Western cultures. Some of these developments occurred in the context of Franco–British rivalry for control of India. Liberal economists, such as [[James Mill]], denigrated Eastern civilizations as static and corrupt. [[Karl Marx]], himself of [[Jewish]] origin, characterized the [[Asiatic mode of production]] as unchanging, because of the economic narrowness of village economies and the State's role in production. [[Oriental despotism]] was generally regarded in Europe as a major factor in the relative failure of [[progress (history)|progress]] of Eastern societies. The study of Islam in particular was central to the field since the majority of people living in the geographical area termed 'the Orient' were Muslims. Interest in understanding Islam was partly fueled by economic considerations of growing trade in the Mediterranean region and the changing cultural and intellectual climate of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004:44&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the century Western archaeology spread across the Middle East and Asia, with spectacular results. In the 1850s, for example, the French Government was determined to mount large-scale operations in Assyria  and Mesopotamia to showcase its dominance in the region. An archaeological team led by [[Victor Place]] excavated the palace of the Assyrian King [[Sargon II]] in [[Dur-Sharrukin|Khorsabad]] (formerly [[Nineveh]]), would become the first systematic excavation of the site. &lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition resulted in a pioneering publication entitled ''Ninevah and Assyria'', jointly authored by [[Victor Place]] and [[Felix Thomas]] and published in around 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Maisels, C.K., ''The Near East: Archaeology in the Cradle of Civilization,'' Routledge, 2005, pp 40-41; Tanner, J.P., “Ancient Babylon: From Gradual Demise to Archaeological Rediscovery,” ''Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin,'' Vol. 47 ,2002, pp 11-20; Library notes on ''Ninive et L'Assyrie, Consul General Avec Des Essais De Restauration,'' by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, [3 volume set],  Imprimerie Imperiale, Paris, 1857, Online: https://www.iberlibro.com/buscar-libro/primera-edicion/tapa-dura/precio-min/30/vi/960590/sortby/1/; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;  New national museums provided a setting for important archaeological finds, most of which were in this period bought back to Europe, and put Orientalists in the public spotlight as never before.

The first serious European studies of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were by the scholars [[Eugene Burnouf]] and [[Max Müller]]. In that time, the academic [[Islamic studies by author (non-Muslim or academic)|study of Islam]] also developed, and, by the mid-19th century, Oriental Studies was a well-established academic discipline in most European countries, especially those with imperial interests in the region. Yet, while scholastic study expanded, so did [[Racism|racist]] attitudes and stereotypes of "inscrutable", "wily" Orientals. This frequently extended to local [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] communities, who were also of [[Genetic studies on Jews|Oriental origin]] and widely recognized as such. Scholarship often was intertwined with prejudicial racist and religious presumptions,&lt;ref&gt;J. Go, "'Racism' and Colonialism: Meanings of Difference and Ruling Practice in America's Pacific Empire" in ''Qualitative Sociology' '''27'''.1 (March 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; to which the new [[biology|biological sciences]] tended to contribute until the middle of the following century.

=== Twentieth century ===
[[File:Rosetta Stone International Congress of Orientalists ILN 1874.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Experts inspecting the [[Rosetta Stone]] during the [[Second International Congress of Orientalists]] in London, 1874]]
The participation in academic studies by scholars from the newly independent nations of the region itself inevitably changed the nature of studies considerably, with the emergence of [[post-colonial studies]] and [[Subaltern Studies]]. The influence of [[Orientalism]] (in the sense used by Edward Said in his [[Orientalism (book)|book of the same name]]) in scholarship on the Middle East was seen to have re-emerged and risen in prevalence again after the end of the Cold War. It is contended that this was partly a response to "a lacuna" in identity politics in international relations generally, and within the 'West' particularly, which was brought about by the absence of Soviet communism as a global adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Hippler and Andrea Lueg (eds.), ''The Next Threat: Western Perceptions of Islam'' (Pluto Press/The Transnational Institute, London, 1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The post–Cold War era has been marked by discussions of Islamist terrorism framing views on the extent to which the culture of the [[Arab world]] and Islam is a threat to that of the West. The essence of this debate reflects a presupposition for which Orientalism has been criticized - that the 'Orient' is defined exclusively by Islam. Such considerations as these were seen to have occurred in the wider context of the way in which many Western scholars responded to international politics in the post–Cold War world; and they were arguably heightened following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004), pp. 223–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic of this type of response to the end of the [[Cold War]] was the popularization of the '[[clash of civilizations]]' thesis. This particular idea of a fundamental conflict between East and West was first advanced by [[Bernard Lewis]] in an article entitled "The Roots of Muslim Rage", written in 1990. Again, this was seen as a way of accounting for new forms and lines of division in post–Cold War international society. The 'clash of civilizations' approach involved another characteristic of Orientalist thought; namely, the tendency to see the region as being one, homogenous 'civilization', rather than as comprising various different and diverse cultures and strands. It was an idea that was taken on more famously by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] in his 1993 article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', called "The Clash of Civilizations?".&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Orientalism}}
The term ''Orientalism'' has come to acquire negative connotations in some quarters and is interpreted to refer to the study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider-caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by [[Edward Said]] in ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=J.J.|title=Oriental enlightenment the encounter between Asian and Western thought|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to those who saw nothing of value in non-Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;For example Thomas R. Trautmann in ''Aryans and British India'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-520-20546-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From "Oriental Studies" to "Asian Studies" ==

{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2012}}
Like the term ''[[Orient]]'', ''Orientalism'' derives from the Latin word ''oriens'' (rising) and, equally likely, from the Greek word ('he'oros', the direction of the rising sun). "Orient" is the opposite of ''[[Western world|Occident]]'', a term for the Western world. In terms of the [[Old World]], [[Europe]] was considered the [[Western world|Occident]] (the west), and its farthest-known extreme the [[Orient]] (the east).  Dating from the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, what is now, in the West, considered 'the [[Middle East]]' was then considered 'the Orient'.  However, use of the various terms and senses derived from "Orient" has greatly declined in the 20th century, not least as trans-Pacific links between Asia and America have grown; nowadays, Asia usually arrives at the USA from the West.

In most [[North America]]n universities, Oriental Studies has now been replaced by [[Asian Studies]] localised to specific regions, such as [[Middle East]]ern or Near Eastern Studies, [[South Asia]]n studies, and [[East Asia]]n Studies.  This reflects the fact that the Orient is not a single, monolithic region but rather a broad area encompassing multiple [[civilization]]s. The generic concept of Oriental Studies, to its opponents, has lost any use it may have once had and is perceived as obstructing changes in departmental structures to reflect actual patterns of modern scholarship.  In many universities, like Chicago, the faculties and institutions have divided; the Biblical languages may be linked with theological institutes, and the study of ancient civilizations in the region may come under a different faculty to studies of modern periods.

In 2007 the Faculty of Oriental Studies at [[Cambridge University]] was renamed the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, but Oxford still has its [[Oriental Institute, Oxford|Faculty for Oriental Studies]], as do [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Chicago]], [[Pontifical Oriental Institute|Rome]], [[School of Oriental and African Studies|London]] (covering African studies also), and [[Oriental Institute (disambiguation)|other universities]].

Various explanations for the change to "Asian studies" are offered; a growing number of professional scholars and students of Asian Studies are themselves Asian or from groups of Asian origin (like [[Asian American]]s). This change of labeling may be correlated in some cases to the fact that sensitivity to the term "Oriental" has been heightened in a more [[politically correct]] atmosphere, although it began earlier: Bernard Lewis' own department at [[Princeton University]] was renamed a decade ''before'' Said wrote his book, a detail that Said gets wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etc.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs/05/Companion/near_eastern_studies.html Princeton University, Near Eastern Studies department]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   By some, the term "Oriental" has come to be thought offensive to non-Westerners. [[Area studies]] that incorporate not only philological pursuits but [[identity politics]] may also account for the hesitation to use the term "Oriental".

Supporters of "Oriental Studies" counter that the term "[[Asia#Etymology|Asian]]" is just as encompassing as "Oriental," and may well have originally had the same meaning, were it derived from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for "East" (a more common derivation is from one or both of two Anatolian proper names). Replacing one word with another is to confuse historically objectionable ''opinions'' about the East with the concept of "the East" itself. The terms Oriental/Eastern and Occidental/Western are both inclusive concepts that usefully identify large-scale cultural differences. Such general concepts do not preclude or deny more specific ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5587">'''Père Fouettard''' ({{IPA-fr|pɛʁ fwetaʁ}}) (French for ''Father Whipper'' or ''Old Man Whipper'') is a character who accompanies St. Nicholas on his rounds during St. Nicholas' Day (6 December) dispensing lumps of coal and/or beatings to naughty children while St. Nicholas gives gifts to the well behaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DhhN_FthpYMC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Le+P%C3%A8re+Fouettard&amp;client=firefox-a |title=Salt:Grain of Life |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known mainly in the far north and eastern regions of France, in the south of Belgium, and in French-speaking Switzerland, although similar characters exist all over Europe (see [[Companions of Saint Nicholas]]). This "Whipping Father" was said to bring a whip with him to spank all of the naughty chidren who misbehaved.

==Origin==
The most popular story about the origin of Le Père Fouettard was first told in the year 1150. An innkeeper (or in other versions a butcher) captures three boys who appear to be wealthy and on their way to enrol in a religious boarding school. Along with his wife, he kills the children in order to rob them. One gruesome version tells that they drug the children, slit their throats, cut them into pieces, and stew them in a barrel. St. Nicholas discovers the crime and resurrects the children. After this, Le Père Fouettard repents and becomes St. Nicholas' partner. A slightly different version of this story claims that St. Nicholas forced Le Père Fouettard to become his assistant as a punishment for his crimes.

Another story states that during the [[Siege of Metz (1552)|Siege of Metz]] (a city in Eastern France) in 1552, an effigy of king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was burned and dragged through the city. Meanwhile, an association of [[Tanning (leather)|tanners]] created a grotesque character (also a tanner) armed with a whip and bound in chains who punished children. After Metz was liberated, the charred effigy of Charles V and the character created by the tanners somehow assimilated into what is now known as Le Père Fouettard. Events surrounding the city's liberation and the burning of the effigy coincided with the passage of St. Nicholas, hence Le Père Fouettard became his "bad cop" counterpart.

In the 1930s, Le Père Fouettard appeared in the United States under the translated name Father Flog or Spanky. Although almost identical to the original French personification, Father Flog had nothing to do with Christmas and also had a female accomplice named Mother Flog. The two doled out specific punishments for specific childhood crimes (e.g. cutting out the tongue for lying).

==Appearance==
The most common depiction of Le Père Fouettard is of a man with a sinister face dressed in dark robes with scraggly unkempt hair and a long beard. He is armed with a whip, a large stick, or bundles of switches. Some incarnations of the character have him wearing a wicker backpack in which children can be placed and carried away. Sometimes he merely carries a large bundle of sticks on his back. Often, his face is darkened to varying degrees. Some say it is because of his being born of a burned effigy, others say that it is from the soot in the chimneys that he goes down with St. Nicholas. In other representations, Le Père Fouettard is identical to the Dutch character [[Zwarte Piet]] (Black Peter). Further renderings of the character show him as being nearly identical to Saint Nicholas or Santa Claus, but wearing a black suit.

==Père Fouettard in popular culture==
* [[Jacques Dutronc]]'s song ''La Fille du père Noël'' (The daughter of Father Christmas) is about Père Fouettard's son having a crush on Santa Claus' daughter.
* Another French pop star, Alain DeLorme, mentioned him in the song "Venez Venez St. Nicolas"
* There is a restaurant named Le Père Fouettard at 9 Rue Pierre Lescot, in Paris which features "Classic Parisian Fare".
* [[Robert Schumann]] composed a piano piece in 1848 most commonly known as Knecht Ruprecht (a similar character, see [[Companions of Saint Nicholas]]), but in some cases the piece is called  Le Père Fouettard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mutopiaproject.org/cgibin/piece-info.cgi?id=784 |title=Album pour la jeunesse - 12.Le Père Fouettard , by R. Schumann (1810–1856) |publisher=Mutopiaproject.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab]], a line of hand-blended perfume oils, created a limited-edition Yule scent in 2008 named Le Père Fouettard consisting of "Whip leather, coal dust, gaufrette, and black licorice."
* Père Fouettard (renamed "Gruzzlebeard" in the English translation) was the main antagonist in the animated show ''[[The Secret World of Santa Claus]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2254">'''Repugnancy costs''' are [[cost]]s borne by an individual or entity as a result of a stimulus that goes against that individual or entity's cultural mores.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin E.

The stimulus could be anything from food to people to an idea. 

These costs are perspective-dependent and individual.  These costs may be different for different groups of people; countries, states, ethnicities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Julio J.

Case of the Market for Kidneys for Transplants,"] Working paper.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term allows for a clear and understandable way of representing the concept of contextual stigma in a literal and applicable sense.

== Origin ==
Repugnancy costs were first mentioned in a debate between [[Alvin E. Roth|Alvin Roth]] and Julio Elias on whether there should be an official [[Gary Becker|market for kidneys]].&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Julio J. and [[Alvin E. Roth|Roth, Alvin E.]] (2007),[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118901049137818211 "Econ One on One: A Market for Kidneys?"] The Wall Street Journal Online.
&lt;/ref&gt; The act of buying and selling [[organ transplant|organs]] may be against one's cultural mores; it may be repugnant.  Hence, this is an additional costs one must bear if such a market was deemed repugnant in the context of one's culture.

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Roma''' was a female [[deity]] who [[National personification|personified]] the city of [[Rome]] and more broadly, the Roman state.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 956.&lt;/ref&gt; Her image appears on the base of the [[column of Antoninus Pius]].

==Problems in earliest attestation==
A helmeted figure on Roman coins of 280-276 and 265-242 BC is sometimes interpreted as Roma but  the identification is contestable.&lt;ref&gt;From "Sear Roman Coins &amp; their Values (RCV 2000 Edition) #25" at www.wildwinds.com [http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/sear5/s0025.t.html] (accessed 22 June 2009): but see Mellor, 974-5 for a more tentative approach to early helmeted figures: other possible identities have been speculated, such as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] or the Trojan captive Rhome, who may be a mythic-poetic personification of Gk. ''rhome'' (strength). (For Rhome, see Hard, R., Rose, H.J., The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology, 2003, p586: limited preview available online: [https://books.google.com/books?id=XfGw5uYrDMYC&amp;pg=PA586&amp;lpg=PA586&amp;dq=Rhome+Trojan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UImFeoca78&amp;sig=pjnjEh468sU6sBWOecUgWUAl1ys&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oVBJSr6sF8KTjAeaxKjQAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7].&lt;/ref&gt; Other early Roman coinage shows a warlike "Amazon" type, possibly Roma but more likely ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' than ''[[Religion in ancient Rome|dea]]''. [[Ennius]] personified the "Roman fatherland" as Roma: for [[Cicero]], she was the "Roman state", but neither of these are ''dea'' Roma.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 963, 1004-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Though her Roman ancestry is possible - perhaps merely her name and the ideas it evoked - she emerges as a Greek deity.

==Roma in the Greek world==
The earliest certain cult to ''dea'' Roma was established at [[Smyrna]] in 195 BC, probably to mark Rome's successful alliance against [[Antiochus III]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 4.56&lt;/ref&gt; Mellor has proposed her cult as a form of religio-political diplomacy which adjusted traditional Graeco-Eastern monarchic honours to Republican mores: honours addressed to the divine personification of the Roman state acknowledged the authority of its offices, Republic and city as divine and eternal.&lt;ref&gt;The Roma cult did not displace cult to individual Roman benefactors. The Hellenophile general [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|Flamininus]] was given divine honours jointly with Roma for his military achievements on behalf of Greek allies: Plutarch, Flamininus, 16, gives the ending lines of what he describes as a lengthy [[Chalcidian League|Chalcidian]] hymn to [[Zeus]], Roma and Flamininus: available online at Thayer's website [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Flamininus*.html] (accessed June 29, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic city-states such as [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Rhodes]] accepted Roma as analogous to their traditional cult personifications of the ''demos'' (ordinary people). In 189 BC, [[Delphi]] and [[Lycia]] instituted festivals in her honour. Roma as "divine sponsor" of athletics and pan-Hellenic culture seems to have dovetailed neatly into a well-established and enthusiastic festival circuit, and temples to her were outnumbered by her civic statues and dedications.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 967.&lt;/ref&gt; In 133 BC, [[Attalus III]] bequeathed the people and territories of [[Pergamon]] to Rome, as to a trusted ally and protector. The Pergamene bequest became the new Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], and Roma's cult spread rapidly within it.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 958-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hellenistic]] religious tradition, gods were served by priests and goddesses by priestesses but Roma's priesthood was male, perhaps in acknowledgment of the virility of Rome's military power.
Priesthood of the Roma cult was competed among the highest ranking local elites.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 965-6: In the East - as later in the provincial West - Roma's priests were probably elected.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to her putative "[[Amazons|Amazonian]]" Roman original, Greek coinage depicts Roma in the "dignified and rather severe style" of a Greek goddess, often wearing a [[mural crown]], or sometimes a [[Phrygian helmet]]. She is occasionally bareheaded.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 960-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In this and later periods, she was often associated with [[Zeus]] (as guardian of oaths) and [[Fides (mythology)|Fides]] (the personification of mutual trust).&lt;ref&gt;Roman cult to Fides was instituted in the Late Republic: Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', 2. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Her Eastern cult appealed for Rome's loyalty and protection - there is no reason to suppose this as other than genuine (and diplomatically sound) respect. A panegyric to her survives, in five [[Sapphic stanza]]s attributed to [[Melinno]].&lt;ref&gt;English and Greek versions in Powell, Anton, The Greek World, Routledge, 1997, p369: limited preview available - [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZlSCexW2L4QC&amp;pg=RA1-PA369&amp;lpg=RA1-PA369&amp;dq=Hail,+Roma,+daughter+of+Ares&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wWtQ8Z67Wj&amp;sig=UiB18ajQIxQICjsKaBnqiO1spvY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Z0dJSovXC96OjAeAp52QCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1]&lt;/ref&gt; In Republican Rome and its Eastern ''coloniae'' her cult was virtually non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little remains of Roma's cult temples in the Eastern Mediterranean world. Four altars survive, and one deliberately mutilated statue.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 960-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[assassination]] of [[Julius Caesar]] led to his [[apotheosis]] and cult as a State ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divus]]'' in Rome and her Eastern [[Colony|colonies]]. Caesar's adopted heir [[Augustus]] ended Rome's civil war and became [[princeps]] ("leading man") of the Republic, and in 30/29 BC, the ''[[koinon|koina]]'' of Asia and Bithynia requested permission to honour him as a living ''divus''. Republican values held monarchy in contempt, and despised Hellenic honours - Caesar had fatally courted both - but an outright refusal might offend loyal provincials and allies. A cautious formula was drawn up: non-Romans could only offer him cult as ''divus'' jointly with ''dea'' Roma.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of modern viewpoints on the religious sincerity of Ruler cult see Harland, P.A., Introduction to ''Imperial Cults within Local Cultural Life: Associations in Roman Asia'', 2003. Originally published in "Ancient History Bulletin / Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte" 17 (2003):85-107. Available online: {{cite web |url=http://www.philipharland.com/publications/articleAHB.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530070951/http://www.philipharland.com/publications/articleAHB.html |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two temples were dedicated for the purpose. Roma was thus absorbed into the earliest (Eastern) form of "[[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]" - or, from an Eastern viewpoint, the cult to Augustus was grafted onto their time-honoured cult to Roma. From here on, she increasingly took the attributes of an Imperial or divine consort to the Imperial ''divus'', but some Greek coin types show her as a seated or enthroned authority, and the Imperial ''divus'' standing upright as her supplicant or servant.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ando, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial cult arose as a pragmatic and ingenious response to an Eastern initiative. It blended and "renewed" ancient elements of traditional religions and Republican government to create a common cultural framework for the unification of Empire as a [[Principate]]. In the West, this was a novelty, as the Gauls, Germans and Celts had no native precedent for ruler cult or a Roman-style administration.&lt;ref&gt;Roma may have had joint (but unattested) cult with Augustus at the three colonial ''Arae Sestianae'' of the Iberian peninsula, probably founded shortly after 19 BC: see Mellor, 989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls|Imperial cult centre]] at [[Lugdunum]] introduced Roman models for provincial and municipal assemblies and government, a Romanised lifestyle, and an opportunity for local elites to enjoy the advantages of citizenship through election to Imperial cult priesthood, with an ''ara'' (altar) was dedicated to Roma and Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;The cult altar was inaugurated in 10 or 12 BC: Fishwick favours 12 BC as both practical and a particularly auspicious date for Augustus&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Roma is well attested by inscriptions and coinage throughout the Western provinces. Literary sources have little to say about her, but this may reflect her ubiquity rather than neglect: in the early Augustan era, she may have been honoured above her living Imperial consort.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick sees the persistence of Roma's Hellenic seniority as ''dea'' (over the Augustan ''divus'') in Western Imperial cult.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 990-993: Mellor finds Roma an essential companion to the Augustan and later Imperial divi, based on the surmise of Imperial cult as less one of obedience than a Romano-Hellenic framework for co-operation and acculturation: emperors of the Principate claimed to represent and sustain the "[[senate and people of Rome]]", not to dominate them.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priests at the Lugdunum complex were known by the Greek title of ''sacerdos''. Most others were ''[[flamen]]'' who - contrary to Roman tradition - served a number of deities.  In general, female Imperial cult honorands (such as the living or deceased and deified Empress and state goddesses) were served by a priestess. Some were wife to the cult priest, but most may have been elected in their own right. One priestess is rather confusedly ''flamina sive sacerdos'' -  Western Imperial cults show remarkably liberal interpretations of cult and priesthood: some appear to be unique. However, with only one possible exception (at Toulouse) ''dea'' Roma was served by priests, as in her Hellenic cult. See Fishwick vol 1, 1, 101 &amp; vol 3, 1, 12-13, &amp; Mellor, 998-1002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Africa (Roman province)|provincial Africa]], one temple to Roma and Augustus is known at [[Leptis Magna]] and another at [[Maktar|Mactar]]. On the Italian peninsula, six have been proven - [[Latium]] built two, one of them privately funded. During the reign of Tiberius, [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] built a grand municipal temple to Roma and Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 1002-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of Rome itself, the earliest known state cult to ''dea'' Roma was combined with cult to Venus at the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Temple of Venus and Roma]]. This was the largest temple in the city, probably dedicated to inaugurate the reformed festival of ''[[Parilia]]'', which was known thereafter as the ''Romaea'' after the Eastern festival in Roma's honour. The temple contained the seated, Hellenised image of ''dea'' Roma - the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]] in her right hand symbolised Rome's eternity.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', vol 1, 257-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 963-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, this was a novel realisation. Greek interpretations of Roma as a dignified deity had transformed her from a symbol of military dominance to one of Imperial protection and ''gravitas''.

Roma's position could be more equivocal. Following the defeat of [[Clodius Albinus]] and his allies by [[Septimius Severus]] at Lugdunum, Roma was removed from the Lugdunum cult ''ara'' to the temple, where along with the Augusti she was co-opted into a new and repressive formulation of Imperial cult. Fishwick interprets the reformed rites at Lugdunum as those offered any ''[[paterfamilias]]'' by his slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick,Vol. 3, 1, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how long this phase lasted, but it appears to have been a unique development.

In a later, even more turbulent era, a common coin type of [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] shows him in the radiate [[solar crown]] of the [[Dominate]]: the reverse offers Rome's Temple of Venus and dea Roma. While Probus' image shows his monarchic Imperium, Roma displays his claims to restoration of Roman tradition and Imperial unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dougsmith.ancients.info/probus.html Examples of Probus' coin types are shown at Doug Smith's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224173302/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/probus.html |date=2009-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"As personification, as goddess or as symbol, the name ''Roma'' stretches from classical Greece to [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s [[New Roman Empire|Fascist propaganda]]... ''Roma'' has been seen as a goddess, a whore, a near-saint, and as the symbol of civilization itself. She remains the oldest continuous political-religious symbol in Western civilization." [[Ronald Mellor]], Introduction, ''The goddess Roma''.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 952.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centre for Cultural Landscape==

The Willowbank Centre for Cultural Landscape is an initiative that builds on its exploration of [[cultural landscape]] theory and practice to define a particularly Canadian perspective in this area of current discussion and debate. It facilitates a program of lecture series, workshops and publications to promote a connection between cultural landscape and cultural practice, and to advocate for its ecological view of cultural and natural heritage conservation. The Centre also coordinates Willowbank’s seat in global deliberations about conservation, whose participants include a cross-section of board, staff and students. In 2013, Willowbank signed an agreement with the [[UNESCO]]-affiliated World Heritage Institute in Shanghai, China, with a focus on the UNESCO Recommendation for Historic Urban Landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/about-us/new/new/ Willowbank agreement with UNESCO-affiliated World Heritage Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was created in 2012 through a multi-year grant from the [[Ontario Trillium Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otf.ca/school-restoration-arts-willowbank?redirected=1] Ontario Trillium Foundation, 2012-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

Willowbank's campus is composed of two main parts, a 19th-century estate, and a former village elementary school with its surrounding lands. The former, described in further detail below, traces its history to 8,000 years of human habitation. The landscape of the estate includes a ravine and a hill upon which sits a 19th-century stone mansion. Newly built and re-built outbuildings have been constructed to house student workshops, including a barn and a forge and stone studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/national-historic-site/index/#menu-2] Willowbank National Historic Site&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjacent to the estate is the former Laura Secord School in the centre of the village, bought in 2012 by Willowbank after it was abandoned. The transfer is designed to house school activities while also returning the building and lands to community use and creating affordable housing. Its original wing was constructed in 1914, with substantial additions made in the 1950s. The original, two-classroom building housed students upstairs while the lower level was a centre of village life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2012/03/22/willowbank-buys-old-laura-secord-school] Willowbank buys old Laura Secord School, Niagara Falls Review, March 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field School==
Willowbank runs a three-week field school every summer in partnership with the Canova Association in the [[Ossola|Ossola Valley]] in Northern Italy. It is a microcosm of the diploma program, with an introduction to cultural landscape theory and practice, an experience of documentation and design, and then a major hands-on component. The work involves creative restoration and adaptive reuse of abandoned medieval stone structures, carried out under the direction of Italian masons and craftsmen. It coincides with the International Architect Encounter in the same place, an annual, intimate conference of world leaders in conservation and ecological design, with whom the field school’s participants are able to engage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/centre-for-cultural-landscape/short-courses/italy/index/] Willowbank Italy Field School&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Historic Site==

Willowbank's campus includes a designated [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] in the century estate to which it traces its name, also designated under Part IV of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'', and further protected by a heritage easement granted to The [[Ontario Heritage Trust]]. It is named after [[willow]] trees that were once located on its grounds, is an example of the rural estates of the wealthy settlers of early 19th century [[Upper Canada]]. Its mansion, which is the centre of campus, was built between 1832 and 1834 for Alexander Hamilton, third son of Robert Hamilton, one of the founders  of Upper Canada. Constructed in the [[Greek Revival]] style of [[architecture]] then at its height in North America for such grand houses, Willowbank's is an example of such buildings on the continent. Designed by architect, John Latshaw, and built of local [[Whirlpool]] [[sandstone]], the building is characterised by the rare features of eight hand-carved columns running its full two-story height, and by a front doorway of Greek design. The 13-acre estate today forms the centre of the Willowbank campus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3474">The '''Simplicity Pattern Company''' is a manufacturer of [[pattern (sewing)|sewing pattern]] guides, under the "Simplicity Pattern", "It's So Easy" and "New Look" brands. The company began in 1927 in [[New York City]]. During the [[Great Depression]], Simplicity allowed home seamstresses to create fashionable clothing in a reliable manner. The patterns are manufactured in the US but are distributed and sold in [[Canada]], [[England]], and [[Australia]], in some markets by [[Burda Style|Burda]] and in [[Mexico]] and [[South Africa]] by third-party distributors. The company licenses its name to the manufacture of non-textile materials such as [[sewing machine]]s, [[doll house]] kits, and sewing supplies. Simplicity is now owned by [[CSS Industries]].

==History==
James J. Shapiro (1909–1995) founded the Simplicity Pattern Company in 1927 and was its first president. The company was based on an idea of his father's, Joseph M. Shapiro (1888 Russia—1968 California), a magazine ad salesman.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Barlett, James B. Steele, ''America: What Went Wrong?'' Andrews McMeel Publishing (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert McG. Thomas|Robert McG. Thomas, Jr.]], "James Shapiro, 85, Innovator In the Home Sewing Industry" ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 3, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1998, the company was acquired by [[Conso International|Conso International Corp.]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Dalton, [http://www.goupstate.com/news/19980611/conso-to-purchase-simplicity-patterns "Conso to purchase Simplicity Patterns"] ''[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]'', June 11, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goupstate.com/news/20001122/conso-acquires-massachusetts-company "Conso acquires Massachusetts company"] ''Spartanburg Herald-Journal'', November 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Conso subsequently changed its name to Simplicity Creative Group, Inc., and since November 3, 2017, has been a subsidiary of CSS Industries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=157093 "Simplicity Creative Group, Inc."] ''Bloomberg'', retrieved November 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171103005428/en/CSS-Industries-Acquires-Simplicity-Creative-Group "CSS Industries, Inc. Acquires Simplicity Creative Group"] (press release) ''Business Wire'', November 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2007, the company had its main plant in [[Niles, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;YaVonda Smalls, [http://articles.southbendtribune.com/2007-06-26/news/26773631_1_niles-plant-paper-mill-outsourcing "Simplicity closing Niles site"] ''South Bend Tribune'', June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sewing from patterns==
Simplicity Patterns, like most home sewing patterns, consist of [[tissue paper]] printed with numerical guides and instructions. The paper is pinned on the fabric, and the sewer then cuts along the printed lines and stitches the cloth together to create the finished clothing. Each Simplicity pattern has step-by-step instructions for cutting, stitching, and assembling of clothes. Simplicity aims to emulate fashion designer clothing, and the company currently produces over 1,600 patterns.

People can acquire knowledge by distance learning tools, for instance, [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Khan Academy]] and so on. Social learning tools may mediate in [[Formal learning|formal]] or [[informal learning]] environments to help create connections between [[learner]]s, [[Teacher|instructor]]s and [[information]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These connections form dynamic knowledge networks.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Social learning tools are used in schools for teaching/learning and in businesses for training. Within a school environment, the use of social learning tools can affect not only the user (student) but his/her caretaker as well as his/her instructor. It brings a different approach to the traditional way of learning which affects the student and his/her support circle. Companies also use social learning tools. They used them to improve knowledge transfer within departments and across teams. Businesses use a variety of these tools to create a social learning environment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; They are also used in company settings to help improve team work, problem solving, and performance in stressful situations.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eduakcja.eu/index.php/en/archives/nr-1-3-2012/40-archiwum/no-1-3-2012/159-social-learning-tools-usage-in-polsh-enterprises.html|title=Social Learning Tools Usage in Polsh Enterprises|last=Żołędziewski|first=Łukasz|date=|website=eduakcja.eu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social learning tools are used for people who are willing to share their good ideas/thoughts with someone else. The ideas can be related to either the academic studies or any other daily skills that we want to share with others. Social learning tools connect learning to our daily lives. It creates a learning environment more truthful to today's society. There are a couple of common elements that should be present in a social learning tool. Technology should be involved to allow physical and cognitive learning. There should be interactions between the people who use the tool and interactions with the software. Another element is trust. Users should trust the software and what other people have created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baborska-Narozny|first=Magdalena|last2=Stevenson|first2=Fionn|last3=Chatterton|first3=Paul|title=A Social Learning Tool – Barriers and Opportunities for Collective Occupant Learning in Low Carbon Housing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2014.12.411|journal=Energy Procedia|volume=62|pages=492–501|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2014.12.411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequently Used Social Learning Tools==

=== Blogger ===
[[File:Blogger logo.svg|thumb|Blogger logo]]
[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] is a site in which users can create their own blog. Blogger can be used in an educational context. A teacher could create a blog in which students could interact on. This would allow students to improve their writing and planning skills. Students would have to think about how they would write out their information on the blog in order to convey their message properly. Blogger provides opportunities for students to share what they wrote with their peers and with their caretakers. The blogs could also be a form of electronic portfolios that could show what the students created during the school year. Blogger has settings in which only people with permission can see or write on the blogs themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bestmastersineducation.com/social-media/|title=The Use of Social Media in School|work=Best Masters in Education|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facebook===
[[File:Facebook Logo Mini.svg|thumb|123x123px|Facebook logo]]
[[Facebook]] is an online communication tool that allows individuals to interact with each other within a virtual community. It has become the most popular social networking site since its beginnings in 2004. Facebook was co-founded in 2004 by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] with his roommates and colleagues from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/mark-zuckerberg-507402|title=Mark Zuckerberg|last=|first=|date=|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg is presently the [[CEO]] of Facebook.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This online communication tool can be used for personal and for professional purposes. Technology plays an integral part of students' daily lives and teachers will need to find ways of implementing these technologies into their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mike|first=Fewkes, Aaron M.{{!}}McCabe,|date=2012-01-01|title=Facebook: Learning Tool or Distraction?.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ972449|journal=Journal of Digital Learning in Teacher Education|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=|issn=2153-2974|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is currently being conducted on the benefits of implementing Facebook in educational settings and how it could potentially be used as a tool for teaching and learning, even if it is known for social networking in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Isham Shah|date=2014-04-03|title=FACEBOOK AS A TOOL FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282251534_FACEBOOK_AS_A_TOOL_FOR_TEACHING_AND_LEARNING?enrichId=rgreq-1a616d2726eef902345ecfdc11da92fc-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzI4MjI1MTUzNDtBUzoyNzg3MDk3OTkwMTQ0MDZAMTQ0MzQ2MTAwMjY2MA==&amp;el=1_x_2&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Facebook can be used to create discussion groups for group projects to divide the work and stay up to date with each other. It can also be used to share articles. Educators can also create professional Facebook accounts for their classrooms, which could be potentially used as a dashboard to upload course material and assignments. It can also be used to create polls to get some feedback and suggestions on the course that the teacher would like to implement. The objective is to improve the methods of teaching as well as the learning experience of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elearningindustry.com/how-to-use-facebook-for-social-learning|title=How To Use Facebook For Social Learning|last=Pappas|first=Christopher|date=2013-05-17|work=eLearning Industry|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the use of technologies, students are more engaged in their learning.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[Khan Academy]], founded in 2006 by [[Sal Khan|Salman “Sal” Khan]], is a non-profit organization providing free online educational resources used by millions of people worldwide.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/media/2014-03-07_implementation_briefing.pdf|title=Research on the Use of Khan Academy in Schools|last=SRI Education|first=|date=2014-03-01|website=Education Week|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for its strong mathematics content provided through video tutorials.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/30030/khan-academy-offers-trainings|title=Khan Academy Trains Teachers to Use Its Videos and Tools|last=|first=|date=2013-07-18|work=KQED|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematics content is designed to help students from kindergarten to grade 12.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2009, Khan Academy began expanding its educational learning platform to include other subjects, including art history and computer science.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The mathematics section is also much more accessible since its recent translation into French. Khan Academy has also diverged to offering other means of learning beyond the online videos, including self-paced training exercises, quizzes, and dashboards for teachers to keep track of student progress.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profweb.ca/en/publications/articles/keeping-track-of-students-learning-using-khan-academy|title=Keeping Track of Students’ Learning Using Khan Academy {{!}} Articles {{!}} Publications|last=APOP|first=|date=2015-05-19|website=Profweb|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the coach resource section which provides guidelines to parents or teachers for example, who want to learn how to use Khan Academy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Khan Academy is used in majority by individuals outside of school for study purposes. However, in recent years, its use in educational settings has been increasing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some teachers have implemented the use of Khan Academy in their classrooms, believing it would simply be an adjunct to their instruction. However, it became more important than this. Some teachers are now thinking of “flipping” the normal functioning of classroom settings and including video tutorials from Khan Academy in their teaching.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/ff_khan/|title=How Khan Academy Is Changing the Rules of Education|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=2011-07-15|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is to have students watch the videos or read the lectures provided by the teacher at home and to do the problem sets during class time. It has been shown that students are having the most difficulty when they are doing their homework.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:Pinterest-logo.png|thumb|99x99px|Pinterest logo]]

=== Pinterest ===
[[Pinterest]] is a web-based [[Software Platform|software platform]] that allows its users to share and discover new information through the use of pictures, descriptions, and short videos. It can also be seen as an online pin board where users can post on their board, collect from other boards, and privately share posted pins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-pinterest-3486578|title=Everything You Need to Know to Start Using Pinterest|work=Lifewire|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be useful in the classroom through having students post their works on their own board or a class board and to share (re-pin) information between their peers. It is easily accessible and is popular for its application that can be used on any mobile or smart device.

=== Skype ===
[[File:Skype logo (fully transparent).svg|thumb|149x149px|Skype logo]][[Skype]] is a free telecommunications tool that gives its users the opportunity to voice chat or video call between various devices such as laptops and cellphones. Although this application requires the Internet, it has grown to be one of the world's most popular communication tools. Skype is an excellent resource to use when collaborating with participants who are in remote areas because discussions and communication can still occur. Skype can be applied to classrooms in many ways. For example, it can be used as a way to include students who are at home due to illness into collaborative discussions held in class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emergingedtech.com/2014/05/20-excellent-free-tools-for-interactive-collaboration-experiences-in-the-classroom/|title=20 Fun Free Tools for Interactive Classroom Collaboration {{!}} Emerging Education Technologies|last=Walsh|first=Kelly|website=www.emergingedtech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twitter===
[[File:Twitter logo.svg|thumb|237x237px|Twitter logo]]
[[Twitter]] is an established micro-blogging service available to individuals with Internet access world-wide and provides unlimited access to social networks for its users, to send and receive messages. In 2006, it was funded by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams. One of the common site users is media outlets to broadcast current news updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4|title=The Real History Of Twitter|last=Carlson|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-13|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, people use Twitter as a daily source of  information to inform themselves on local and world news. Another way that Twitter is utilized, is in the classroom, when a teacher builds a classroom account which can be viewed by their students. This account would allow teachers to post reminders for test revisions, assignment due dates, upcoming field trips and conferences, and review post lessons and answer homework questions. For future lesson plans, teachers could have students tweet what they learned from the previous class and reflect on the content and then engage in classroom discussions on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bestmastersineducation.com/social-media/|title=The Use of Social Media in School|work=Best Masters in Education|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== YouTube ===
[[File:Logo of YouTube (2005-2011).svg|thumb|YouTube logo]]
[[YouTube]] is a video-sharing website founded in 2005 that was created for users to share, like, upload, and comment on videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webwise.ie/parents/what-is-youtube/|title=Explained: What is YouTube?|date=2015-10-10|work=Webwise.ie|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, YouTube can be used on many devices through applications like its [[YouTube App|YouTube app]]. Although it is mainly used for music, videos on reviewing items or how to do something, it may also be used for educational purposes. There are many accounts just for specific educational subjects like [[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]], an account that focuses on subjects like anatomy, biology, chemistry and physics. YouTube can be a great social learning tool in education in many different ways: showing videos on different subjects in class or having students research how something works to answer questions, for homework or even to seek further knowledge. There are many platforms of YouTube that lead to other useful social learning tools for educational purposes. [[TED Talks]] created its account on YouTube, which provides videos of the best ideas from trusted voices discussing different issues, sharing knowledge or facts and opinions, sharing poetry and spoken word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug|title=TED|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For education, TED has created its own platform called [[TED-Ed]], which is essentially short TED Talks videos that may be used for information or insight purposes on many different school subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/social-media-tools-for-education/|title=25 Awesome Social Media Tools for Education - InformED|date=2013-11-15|work=InformED|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is even such thing as [[TeacherTube]], which is another type of social learning tool similar to YouTube though initially created for education teachers. It may be used for teachers, students or parents through the use of published educational videos with a library of different content filled with videos, audio and pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edudemic.com/youtube-in-classroom/|title=The Teacher’s Guide to Using YouTube in the Classroom {{!}} Edudemic|website=www.edudemic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Environments==

The different environments in which social learning tools can be used may influence the connections between learners, educators and the knowledge or information being acquired. These environments can be formal, non-formal, informal or virtual.
*'''[[Formal learning]]''', is the planned process of acquiring knowledge that happens within a structured educational or institute setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/strengthening-education-systems/quality-framework/core-resources/learning-environment/|title=Learning Environment {{!}} Education {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lecturers in the university setting may use [[Moodle]] to post class lectures and the latest information to students, e.g. courseware used during lectures, coursework, quizzes, and forums. Students can both prepare and review for lectures based on what professors have posted at any given time.
*[[Nonformal learning|'''Non-formal learning''']], is the planned process learning that is voluntary and not in a structured environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pjp-eu.coe.int/en/web/youth-partnership/non-formal-learning|title=Non-formal learning / education|website=youth partnership|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of planned learning that is not directly associated with school or the education system is done in a non-formal learning environment. For example, taking swimming lessons at the town pool. The swimming lessons take place in an unstructured environment though are planned, organized, and taught by an instructor of prior knowledge on the subject. Social learning tools can be used in this particular environment to facilitate learning like showing a video on [[YouTube]] on how to swim.
*'''[[Informal learning]]''', is when information is gained inadvertently or unstructured, which usually happens on a day-to-day basis. Informal learning happens outside of the formal classroom during conversations among people, through exploration and personal experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fctl.ucf.edu/teachingandlearningresources/learningenvironments/informal.php|title=Learning Environments: Informal Learning Settings - UCF Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning|website=www.fctl.ucf.edu|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many circumstances can be considered to be part of an informal learning environment, e.g. the casual watching of videos on [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]] or [[YouTube]] feed.
*[[Virtual learning environment|'''Virtual learning''']], is when learning is done via the use of web-based platforms in and out of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://global.oup.com/uk/orc/learnvle/|title=Oxford University Press {{!}} Online Resource Centre {{!}} Learn about Virtual Learning Environment/Course Management System content|last=GOODALL|first=Fiona|website=global.oup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning environment is almost always used for any social learning tool. The virtual learning environment (VLE) encourages students to explore, discover and exchange information quickly, creatively and independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/4365517bede69a6ce72f100e145c7562/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=33585|title=Why use a virtual learning environment? - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many social learning tools created for the sole purpose of education. The education system has adopted technology as a way to educate students in school and outside of school settings, where students have shown to work well in the VLE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edtechnology.co.uk/Article/a-guide-to-successfully-adopting-technology-based-learning-elliot-gowans-vp-at-d2l|title=A guide to successfully adopting technology-based learning|work=Education Technology|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social learning tools including [[Moodle]], [[Khan Academy]], [[TED-Ed]] and [[TeacherTube]] can all be used both in school and at home through the use of the [[Internet]]. This goes to show that social learning tools can be both used within all learning environments while being used for educational purposes. However, it is important for these social learning tools to first be introduced in the formal learning environment, e.g. in the classroom, in order to be established as first an educational tool and second a [[social media platform]] that may be accessible outside of school.

The majority of informal learning environments are directly related to the use of social media, e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], [[Television channels|Television Channels]] and so on. For instance, there are many Food TV or [[YouTube]] Channels that allow people to self-teach themselves how to cook. This is done through the informal and VLE where a person can simply learn from the comfort of their own home and according to their own pace. Not only does [[social software]] or [[Media (communication)|media]] allow society to gain new knowledge or information; it is easily accessible and can even happen without the desire or intent of learning.

== Effectiveness: Education and Business ==
* The student/employee learning experience is expanded and advanced through the usage of technology.

=== Convenience ===
Social learning tools are convenient because through the various platforms that are now available, communication between students and teachers is fluid and the exchange of knowledge and ideas can be achieved remotely. This means that both parties are no longer required to travel in order to attend school and to study content based subjects.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownson|first=Kenneth|date=2004|title=The Benefits of a Work-at-Home Program|url=https://ovidsp-tx-ovid-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/sp-3.28.0a/ovidweb.cgi?WebLinkFrameset=1&amp;S=OBMKFPOHMNDDJEBBNCFKDDOBFKGAAA00&amp;returnUrl=ovidweb.cgi%3f%26Full%2bText%3dL%257cS.sh.22.23%257c0%257c00126450-200404000-00007%26S%3dOBMKFPOHMNDDJEBBNCFKDDOBFKGAAA00&amp;directlink=https%3a%2f%2fovidsp.tx.ovid.com%2fovftpdfs%2fFPDDNCOBDDBBMN00%2ffs046%2fovft%2flive%2fgv025%2f00126450%2f00126450-200404000-00007.pdf&amp;filename=The+Benefits+of+a+Work-at-Home+Program.&amp;pdf_key=FPDDNCOBDDBBMN00&amp;pdf_index=/fs046/ovft/live/gv025/00126450/00126450-200404000-00007|journal=The Health Care Manager|volume=23|pages=141–144|via=Ovid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can communicate with their teachers over the Internet and attend and actively participate in lectures. Social learning tools provide both students and teachers with a media platform that enables [[distance education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beldarrain|first=Yoany|title=Distance Education Trends: Integrating new technologies to foster student interaction and collaboration|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/doi/pdf/10.1080/01587910600789498?needAccess=true|journal=Distance Education|volume=27|issue=2|pages=139–153|doi=10.1080/01587910600789498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost-Efficient ===
Social learning tools give access, as a hub, to sources of information and resources online, either for free or at low costs through the use of the Internet. Most of these tools can easily be downloaded and used on a smartphone, tablet or computer. For example, there are online applications ([[Application software|apps]]) like EasyBib, which generates bibliographic citations in the necessary styles as needed for research, essays and other assignments and does this at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Ullen|first=Mary K.|last2=Kessler|first2=Jane|title=Citation apps for mobile devices|url=https://www-emeraldinsight-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/RSR-09-2015-0041|journal=Reference Services Review|volume=44|issue=1|pages=48–60|doi=10.1108/rsr-09-2015-0041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== School-Wide Application ===
Social learning tools are applicable to elementary, high school, CEGEP, and university level learning. The social media platforms such as Facebook, Skype or Twitter could enhance the communication and interaction between students and their teachers. For example, teachers could post assignments, schedules, lesson summaries or notices regarding class updates for the students to view. For professional development, it provides teachers with the networking to connect with other professionals, share lesson plans, and receive up to date research regarding how education is taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/leaders-link/educational-social-media-use/|title=Dos and Don'ts for Using Social Media as a Teacher|date=2014-10-01|work=Concordia University-Portland|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, students could post their questions online for the teacher to answer in the group section, have class discussions and exchange ideas, and incorporate other forms of communication. As well, enable students to find real world applications and associate it with their topic. The platforms mentioned above, allow students to look beyond the classroom for answers to questions and to obtain outside input.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://campustechnology.com/articles/2012/01/19/pros-and-cons-of-social-media-in-the-classroom.aspx|title=Pros and Cons of Social Media in the Classroom -- Campus Technology|website=Campus Technology|language=en|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning Tools ===
Social networking permits students to research and gather information on topics beyond the classroom setting. For example, Twitter is one of the social learning tools implemented into classrooms for language learning. Tweets are a method of improving short essays and supports grammatically correct writing and reading skills of a language. It is a form of active learning which further engages the students. After posting a tweet, students would get feedback from other site users and have a second opinion on their writing piece. Another advantage would be to use Twitter in large lecture halls, so students could engage in the topic of discussion and share their interests and thoughts with their colleagues and professors in an ongoing basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamidon, Alias, Siraj, Kokila, Mohammed, Thanabalan|first=Ida, Norlidah, Saedah, K, Mariani, T,|date=2013|title=Potential of Twitter in Post-reading Activities Among Community College Students in Malaysia|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S187704281303838X/1-s2.0-S187704281303838X-main.pdf?_tid=e1ec909c-6b71-443e-b51c-97c39361e7a3&amp;acdnat=1521472050_a4b678aa13859aabda8bc5f910569162|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=103|pages=725–734|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial Advantages ===
There are several advantages to the field of commerce, when it comes to implementing social learning tools in the workplace. If businesses create a forum for customers to write their feedbacks, they could have more ideas about how to improve their products, which enables the company to create better marketing strategies. Furthermore, employees could use the Internet or other program systems, in order to work from home. They could be informed about the current issues and concerns of the workplace. It allows people to concentrate without any distractions at the office, it offers the flexibility of scheduling, time engagement and committing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownson|first=Kenneth|date=2004-04-01|title=The Benefits of a Work-at-home Program|url=https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=15192994|journal=The Health Care Manager|language=ENGLISH|volume=23|issue=2|issn=1525-5794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment Opportunities ===
Social media platforms has made searching for job employment and connecting with potential employers more available for students entering the workforce for both part-time and full-time work. For example, Facebook and Twitter can be utilized to follow the companies’ postings and what is going on in the field.

[[LinkedIn]] is a website designed for students or other individuals to create professional profiles, post their curriculum vitae, receive current notifications on available employment and network with companies, businesses, school boards and industries to apply for a wider variety of job offers.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Drawbacks in a Classroom Setting==
===Inappropriate or Offensive Use===

A major concern among educators regarding social learning tools is the lack of control and monitoring. When students are given access to the Internet, they may post inappropriate content or use these sites in a way that can be disrespectful or damaging to others. Educators do not always have the means to be able to monitor every student's usage of these social learning tools, therefore students may be able to take advantage of this privilege for their own personal benefit and amusement. Posting pornography or using foul language are just a few examples that highlight the offensive and inappropriate behaviour that can be exhibited by students through social learning tools in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.schooliseasy.com/2014/02/social-media-in-the-classroom/|title=5 pros and cons of social media in the classroom for educational use|date=2014-02-21|work=School is Easy Tutoring|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction From Learning===

Social learning tools give students access to the Internet, where they can take advantage of other irrelevant websites and interfaces. It is very easy for students to get distracted by other social platforms that can divert their attention away from information being presented in class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://campustechnology.com/articles/2012/01/19/pros-and-cons-of-social-media-in-the-classroom.aspx|title=Pros and Cons of Social Media in the Classroom -- Campus Technology|website=Campus Technology|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately results in a disruption to the student's learning process which is a common concern for the majority of faculty members.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.onlinelearningsurvey.com/reports/social-media-for-teaching-and-learning-2013-report.pdf|title=Social Media for Teaching and Learning|last=Seaman|first=Jeff|publisher=Pearson Learning Solutions|year=2013|isbn=|location=Boston, MA|pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown that disruption to the learning process can significantly affect a student’s ability to retain information into their long-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/leaders-link/educational-social-media-use/|title=Dos and Don'ts for Using Social Media as a Teacher|date=2014-10-01|work=Concordia University-Portland|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators should be made aware of the potential risk for technology to be a distraction and set clear guidelines for their students to follow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Cyberbullying===

As the use of technology increases, cyberbullying is becoming more prevalent among students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Peter|date=July 2006|title=An Investigation into Cyberbullying, its Forms, Awareness and Impact, and the Relationship Between Age and Gender in Cyberbullying|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RBX03-06.pdf|journal=Anti-Bullying Alliance|volume=|pages=|via=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130323025443/https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/RBX03-06.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although social learning tools give students the ability to interact with teachers and peers, it also provides them with the opportunity to bully others online. This type of malicious behaviour can be seen at every level of education, including college campuses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Educators should plan to intervene on any incidents of cyberbullying that they witness in order to prevent more serious offences. They should also encourage respectful and positive behaviours towards peers when in the classroom and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Notar|first=Charles|date=2013|title=Cyberbullying: Resources for Intervention and Prevention|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1053892.pdf|journal=Universal Journal of Educational Research|volume=1|pages=133–137|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of Face-to-Face Communication===

There is much speculation about whether or not social learning tools can provide enough opportunity for the development of real-life social skills. Some educators are concerned that students will not fully develop the ability to communicate effectively or command attention if they are constantly learning through a screen. Although social learning tools create opportunities for students to interact with others via web interfaces, it does not offer them authentic real-life interactions where students are forced to express themselves verbally or connect with others face-to-face.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Protection of Students’ Privacy===

Social learning tools such as Facebook and Twitter are online networking websites that are public and can be accessed by anyone. Parents and educators alike have expressed their concerns about students using these platforms, as they could expose students’ identities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Protecting students’ personal privacy should be a top priority for educators, however this can be a challenge when using social learning tools. To prevent these issues from arising, schools should develop a system which ensures that students stay anonymous when posting content online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/01/how_to_protect_students_personal_data.html|title=The Best Way to Protect Students’ Personal Data|last=Berdik|first=Chris|date=2017-01-18|work=Slate|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress for Teachers===

Social learning tools give students the ability to communicate efficiently with teachers outside of regular classroom hours. Although this may be a benefit to student learning, excessive stress is placed on teachers to respond quickly and provide feedback. Many faculty members have expressed that technology has harmed their work environment, as digital communication increases their stress levels. Furthermore, they have reported that digital communication has increased the number of hours they work in a day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators can also experience added pressure to learn how to teach with social learning tools. Many teachers are skilled with using technology, however they do not possess the knowledge on how to implement social learning tools in teaching. Educators need to be taught how and when to use technology, so they can effectively implement it within their curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/195592643&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plagiarism and Student Integrity===

Academic integrity is an important part of learning in all educational settings. Plagiarism is a concern for teachers that can be amplified when students are using social learning tools. The Internet is a database that holds a multitude of resources available to online users. Unfortunately, direct access to all of this information when using social learning tools makes it easy for students to copy the work of others and use it as their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elearningfacultymodules.org/index.php/Academic_Integrity_vs._Dishonesty|title=Academic Integrity vs. Dishonesty - E-Learning Faculty Modules|website=elearningfacultymodules.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of Equipment===

Social learning tools would not exist without the technological devices that harbor them. In order to implement social learning tools into the classroom, the school or school board must invest a large sum of money in order to purchase technological devices for its students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/aug/01/schools-slowly-edtech-sector-cubetto-kahoot-firefly|title=Out with the old school? The rise of ed tech in the classroom|last=Manning|first=Ellen|date=2017-08-01|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the budget available, there may not be enough money to buy devices for every student to use. Furthermore, personal cell phones are a popular device that can be used as a vehicle for teaching using social learning tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.schoolmoney.org/advantages-using-cell-phones-classroom/|title=Advantages of Using Cell Phones in the Classroom - SchoolMoney.org|date=2017-02-15|work=SchoolMoney.org|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not every student has the money to buy a cell phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.growingwireless.com/get-the-facts/quick-facts|title=Kids Wireless Use Facts|website=www.growingwireless.com|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Red Seas''''' is a series appearing in the British comics magazine ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'',  written by [[Ian Edginton]] and drawn by [[Steve Yeowell]].

The stories revolve around Captain Jack Dancer and the crew of his ship the Red Wench. It mixes pirates with anomalous phenomena, including magic, [[zombies]], the [[hollow earth]] and [[werewolves]].

==Characters==

===Crew===
*'''Jack Dancer''': Captain of the Red Wench, late of The [[Royal Navy]]. Having encouraged his crew to rebel against a tyrannical Captain, they elected to follow him into a life of piracy on the high seas, forever on the run from British justice.
*'''Ginger Tom''': Jim's father. A grizzled old sea-dog.
*'''Bill''': A straight-talking, somewhat overweight Scot.
*'''Jim Salt''': Tom's son. A cockney teenager who was killed by Isabella during the events of "The Hollow Earth", leaving Tom heartbroken. The formless entity known as Hnau entered into Jim's corpse, thereby gaining the means to explore the world he had so long ruled over.
*'''Julius''': A young black sailor, illegitimate son of a famous London composer.
*'''Erebus''': An immortal, double-headed dog's head on a robotic chassis, formerly guardian between the realms of the living and the dead, a role in which he seemed to be largely analogous to [[Cerberus]] of Greek mythology. The heads of Erebus have been a vital part of the crew, possessed of a wealth of knowledge of the mythic and arcane adversaries which Jack's crew frequently find themselves facing.
*'''Alexander Dancer''': a late addition to the crew, half-brother of Jack.

===Enemies===
*'''Doctor Orlando Doyle''' was a necromancer who sailed on a ship crewed entirely by the reanimated corpses of drowned sailors. He kidnapped Isabella to try to gain the secret of eternal life, destroying the Red Wench and killing most of Jack's crew along the way. He was defeated by no less than [[Satan]] himself. Doyle also appeared, although in a somewhat different guise, in the second series of Edginton's 2000AD story [[Stickleback (comics)|Stickleback]]''.
*'''Isabella''' was a young witch and Jack's girlfriend. After enduring several hardships at the hands of Orlando Doyle's zombie crew, she abandoned Jack to 'find herself.' She was next encountered as Queen of the hidden land beneath the Earth, worshipped by the lizard-like race there as She-who-must-be-obeyed, having killed her own father, a shaman, to obtain his power. Now openly hostile to Jack and his crew, she killed Jim and attempted to slay Hnau, the benevolent power who maintained the subterranean world. Hnau sent her to Mars, where before she could suffocate she was slain by Martians bearing an uncanny resemblance to those of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.
*'''Professor Karel Toten''', late of Leipzig University, is a recurring villain who seems to be nothing more than a spirit form contained in his clothes, his face a blank porcelain mask. He commands power over lost souls, using them to animate men of straw and sacking, and later even metal, his army of 'Hollow Men.'

===Allies===
*'''Mistress Meryl''' Landlady of the Jolly Cripple, the pub on New Providence Island once frequented by the crew of the Red Wench, and sometime girlfriend of Billy.
*'''Hnau''' was the formless entity who maintained the subterranean world below the Earth's Crust. A hive-mind composed of the last of an exiled race of Martians who fell to Earth in pre-history, it used its powers to preserve and succour a microcosm of the ancient world deep beneath the surface, populated by life that fell through the crack created by the Martian's fall. Now resides in Jim Salt's body.
*'''[[Isaac Newton]]''', in the world of The Red Seas, has lived far beyond his natural lifespan, a member of the Brotherhood of the Book.
*'''Chevalier Augustus''' - Julius' estranged father, who once helped Isaac Newton thwart a plague of werewolves in London

==Plot==
"Under the Banner of King Death" saw the crew fighting the [[zombie]] [[pirates]] of Doctor Orlando Doyle, and culminated in an appearance by [[Satan]] himself. It was this first story that saw the destruction of the erstwhile pirate's ship and the deaths of most of the crew.
It was also where Erebus joined the team - sent on a spiritual quest by Isabella's shaman father, Jack Dancer travelled to the Spirit World and decapitated Erebus in order to use his immortal heads as a spirit compass to help him locate Isabella, who had been kidnapped by Doyle.

"Twilight of the Idols" saw the crew captured by the Royal Navy, only to be saved from hanging by an elderly [[Aladdin]], who wanted their help in finding the floating island of [[Laputa]].

"Meanwhile..." explored what was happening to the cast of secondary characters while Jack and his crew were away. Erebus and the staff of the Jolly Cripple clashed swords for the first time with Toten. This was also where Erebus gained a new lease of life on his mechanical body; desiring his aid in gathering souls, Toten presented Erebus with the chassis as a bribe - Erebus having up until then been carried about in a glass jar. With Mistress Meryl's help, Erebus double-crossed Toten and kept the chassis.

"Underworld" and "The Hollow Land" saw the crew saved from hanging again, (this time at the hands of the Pirate Council) by Jack's half-brother Alexander. Alexander, together with Isaac Newton, recruited Jack's help on an expedition to find their father, who had gone missing during an expedition to a subterranean world below the Earth's surface. Having located the senior Dancer, they were soon embroiled in a civil war between two tribes of lizard men, and shortly after met with Isabella once more. Both Isabella and Jim died before the return to the surface world, although Jim was resurrected, after a fashion, by the Martian entity Hnau.

"With a bound he was free..." focussed on Isaac Newton's adventures with lycanthropes while the crew were below the Earth's surface.

"War Stories" jumped several hundred years into the future, during the [[London Blitz]] of [[World War II]] . It featured the reappearance of Toten, as well as Erebus minus a head and Hnau, a shapeshifting entity in Jim's form.

"Old Gods", set two years after 'Hollow Land', saw [[George Washington]] recruit Jack's crew to aid him in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]].

==Shared universe==
By virtue of several shared people, places and concepts, The Red Seas forms part of the same [[shared universe|universe]] as many of other Ian Edginton's stories, both for 2000AD and other publishers.

Orlando Doyle, villain of the first series of The Red Seas, features predominantly in the second series of [[Stickleback (comics)|Stickleback]] as a blind seer or scholar, member of the Brotherhood of the Book.

The Brotherhood of the Book, a concept introduced in The Red Seas whereby certain individuals are keepers of the repository of humanity's hidden wisdom, was also returned to in Stickleback, operating out of the same secret base beneath London, the [[Temple of Mithras]], which may act as a hub around which the different dimensions of Edginton's stories revolve.

The Jolly Cripple, the tavern which Jack Dancer's crew frequent, also appeared as a pub in Stickleback.

The spider-like Martians which appear at the end of 'The Hollow Land' may be a deliberate nod to Edginton's [[H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (comics)|H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds]] comic adaptation.

'''The Wolfe Pack''' is a [[literary society]] devoted to [[Rex Stout]]'s character [[Nero Wolfe]].&lt;ref name="aboutus"&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOUT US: Who We Are and What We Do|url=http://www.nerowolfe.com/htm/about_us/about_us.htm|publisher=The Wolfe Pack|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As publicity for [[William S. Baring-Gould]]'s book ''Nero Wolfe of West 35th Street'', [[Viking Press]] ran a "Mammoth New Nero Wolfe Contest" in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt; Four years later, John McAleer began working on what would become ''Rex Stout: A Biography''. McAleer obtained the contest mailing list and began correspondence with one of the fans, Ellen Krieger.&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt; Krieger desired to form a literary society devoted to Wolfe and McAleer provided the name: The Wolfe Pack.&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt;

The first Nero Wolfe dinner was held in 1977 at The Lotus Club in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferretti|first=Fred|title=Amid the Orchids, A Feast for Nero And the Wolfe Pack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/09/archives/amid-the-orchids-a-feast-for-nero-and-the-wolfe-pack.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 9, 1977|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dinner, entitled "Maitre D'tective: Rex Stout," honored John McAleer and his book ''Rex Stout: A Biography'', recently published by [[Little, Brown and Company]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; There were 131 guests who included [[Otto Penzler]] editor, publisher, and owner of [[The Mysterious Bookshop]] which would open two years after the dinner; Eleanor’ Sullivan, then-editor of ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]''; and Dilys Winn, founder of Murder Ink, the West Side mystery bookstore that sponsored the dinner.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

At the dinner, guests received a questionnaire to determine interest in an ongoing Wolfe Pack society.&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt; Six months later the society was born.&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt;

Over the course of the numerous novels and short stories, Rex Stout gave numerous addresses for [[Nero Wolfe#Brownstone|Wolfe's brownstone]]. In 1996, The Wolfe Pack investigated the issue and found that only one possibility matched the description given in the stories: 454 West 35th Street.&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Luke|title=Nero Wolfe's Brownstone|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nero-wolfe-s-brownstone|publisher=[[Atlas Obscura]]|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]], the group had a commemorative plaque placed at the address.

*:''Triggered by &lt;code&gt;\bpsychologydictionary\.org\b&lt;/code&gt; on the global blacklist''|bot=Cyberbot II|invisible=false}}
'''Time-compressed speech''' refers to an audio recording of verbal text in which the text is presented in a much shorter time interval than it would through normally-paced [[real time (media)|real time]] speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychologydictionary.org/time-compressed-speech/  Time-Compressed Speech definition.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic purpose is to make recorded speech contain more words in a given time, yet still be understandable.  For example: a paragraph that might normally be expected to take 20 seconds to read, might instead be presented in 15 seconds, which would represent a time-compression of 25% (5 seconds out of 20).

The term "time-compressed speech" should not be confused with "[[Dynamic range compression|speech compression]]", which controls the volume range of a sound, but does not alter its time envelope.

== Methods ==
While some voice talents are capable of speaking at rates significantly in excess of general norms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevoe.com/anecdotes/a-very-brief-history-on-the-fast-talking-style/  A Very Brief History of the Fast Talking Style]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmfarm.tripod.com/chant.html  The Auctioneers Chant]&lt;/ref&gt; the term "time-compressed speech" most usually refers to examples in which the time-reduction has been accomplished through some form of electronic processing of the recorded speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/compressed+speech  Compressed Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/time-compression  Time Compression]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, recorded speech can be electronically time-compressed by:  increasing its speed (linear compression); removing silences (selective editing); a combination of the two (non-linear compression).&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  The speed of a recording can be increased, which will cause the material to be presented at a faster rate (and hence in a shorter amount of time), but this has the undesirable side-effect of increasing the frequency of the whole passage, raising the pitch of the voices, which can reduce intelligibility.

There are normally silences between words and sentences, and even small silences within certain words, both of which can be reduced or removed ("edited-out") which will also reduce the amount of time occupied by the full speech recording.  However, this can also have the effect of removing verbal "punctuation" from the speech, causing words and sentences to run together unnaturally, again reducing intelligibility.

The current preferred method of time-compression is called "non-linear compression", which employs a combination of selectively removing silences; speeding up the speech to make the reduced silences sound normally-proportioned to the text; and finally applying various data algorithms to bring the speech back down to the proper pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  This produces a more acceptable result than either of the two earlier techniques; however, if unrestrained,  removing the silences and increasing the speed can make a selection of speech sound more insistent, possibly to the point of unpleasantness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/04/advertising-tactics-that-bug-americans-the-most/index.htm  Advertising Tactics That Bug Americans the Most]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

===Advertising===
Time-compressed speech is frequently used in television and radio advertising.  The advantage of time-compressed speech is that the same number of words can be compressed into a smaller amount of time, reducing advertising costs, and/or allowing more information to be included in a given radio or TV advertisement. It is usually most noticeable in the information-dense caveats and disclaimers presented (usually by legal requirement) at the end of commercials—the aural equivalent of the "[[small print|fine print]] " in a printed contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.mit.edu/speech/papers/1992/arons_AVIOS92_timecompressed_speech.pdf  Techniques, Perception, and Applications of Time-Compressed Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice, however, is not new:  before electronic methods were developed, spokespeople who could talk extremely quickly and still be understood were widely used as voice talents for radio and TV advertisements, and especially for recording such disclaimers.

===Education===
Time-compressed speech has educational applications such as increasing the information density of trainings, and as a study aid.  A number of studies have demonstrated that the average person is capable of relatively easily comprehending speech delivered at higher-than-normal rates, with the peak occurring at around 25% compression (that is, 25% faster than normal); this facility has been demonstrated in several languages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03211403  Perceptual adjustment to time-compressed speech: A cross-linguistic study]&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversational speech (in English) takes place at a rate of around 150 wpm (words per minute), but the average person is able to comprehend speech presented at rates of up to 200-250 wpm without undue difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;Barabasz, A. F.; ''A study of recall and retention of accelerated lecture presentation''; '''Journal of Communication'''; 18(3), 1968: p.283–287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz, C.R.; ''Effects of Time Compressed Speech Upon the Comprehension of A Visual Oriented Television Lecture'' (1971); cited in '''Handbook of Research on Educational Communications and Technology'''; by David H. Jonassen; Association of Educational Communications and Technology (AECT);  Bloomington, IN:  2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Blind and severely visually impaired subjects scored similar comprehension levels at even higher rates, up to 300-350 wpm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icphs2007.de/conference/Papers/1186/1186.pdf  Comprehension of  Ultra-Fast Speech – Blind vs. "Normally Hearing" Persons (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Blind people have been found to use time-compressed speech extensively, for example, when reviewing recorded lectures from high school and college classes, or professional trainings.  Comprehension rates in older blind subjects have been found to be as good, or in some cases better than those found in younger sighted subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon-Salant, S and Friedman, S. A.; ''Recognition of Rapid Speech By Blind and Sighted Adults''; '''Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research'''; 54(2), April 2011: p.622-631&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have determined that the ability to comprehend highly time-compressed speech tends to fall off with increased age,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon-Salant, S. and Fitzgibbons, P.J.; ''Sources of age-related recognition difficulty for time-compressed speech''; '''Journal of Language, Speech, and Hearing Research'''; 44(4), August 2001: p.709-19&lt;/ref&gt; and is also reduced when the language of the time-compressed speech is not the listener's native language.&lt;ref&gt;Zhoa, Y.; ''The effects of listeners' control of speech rate on second language comprehension''; '''Applied Linguistics'''; 18(1), March 2997:  p.49-68&lt;/ref&gt; Non-native speakers can, however, improve their comprehension level of time-compressed speech with multiday training.&lt;ref&gt;Banai, K. and Lavner, Y.; ''Perceptual Learning of Time-Compressed Speech:  More than Rapid Adaptation''; '''PLoS One'''; National Institute of Health;  Bethesda, Maryland: &amp;(10), October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice Mail===
[[Voice mail]] systems have employed time-compressed speech since as far back as the 1970s.  IN this application, the technology enables the rapid review of messages in high-traffic systems, by a relatively small number of people.&lt;ref&gt;Arons, B. “Techniques, Perception, and Applications of Time-Compressed Speech.” In Proceedings of 1992 Conference, '''American Voice I/O Society''', Sep. 1992, pp. 169-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Streaming Multimedia===
Time-compressed speech has been explored as one of a variety of interrelated factors which may be manipulated to increase the efficiency of streaming multimedia presentations, by significantly reducing the [[latency (engineering)|latency]] times involved in the transfer of large digitally encoded media files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lhe/papers/chi99.tc.doc  Omoigui, N., He, L., Gupta, A., Grudin, J., and Sanocki, E.; ''Time-Compression: Systems Concerns, Usage, and Benefit''; '''Microsoft Research'''; Redmond, Washington:  1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vernacular architecture''' is an [[architectural style]] that is designed based on local needs, availability of [[construction material]]s and reflecting local traditions. Traditionally, vernacular architecture did not use formally-schooled [[architect]]s, but relied on the design skills and tradition of local builders, who were rarely given any attribution for the work. However, since the late 19th century many professional architects have worked in this style and interest in vernacular architecture now forms part of a broader interest in sustainable design.

Vernacular architecture can be contrasted against [[polite architecture]] which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. This article also covers the term '''traditional architecture''', which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term [[wikt:vernacular|vernacular]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''vernaculus'', meaning "domestic, native, indigenous"; from ''verna'', meaning "native [[slave]]" or "home-born slave". The word probably derives from an older [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vernacular|title=Vernacular|publisher=online etymology dictionary|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=vernacular|publisher=yourdictionary.com|title=Vernacular(noun)|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020608/windows/roots.htm|title=Fiddling with words, again!|date=June 8, 2002|publisher=Tribune India|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is borrowed from [[linguistics]], where vernacular refers to language use particular to a time, place or group. In architecture, it refers to that type of architecture which is [[Indigenous knowledge|indigenous]] to a specific time or place (not imported or copied from elsewhere). It is most often applied to [[residential]] buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vernacular Dictionary.com definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=88049&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge advanced learner's dictionary definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/vernacular Merriam–Webster definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The terms [[vernacular]], [[Folk culture|folk]], [[traditional]], and [[wikt:popular|popular]] architecture are sometimes used synonymously. However, Allen Noble wrote a lengthy discussion of these terms in ''Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions'' where he presents scholarly opinions that folk building or ''folk architecture'' is built by "persons not professionally trained in building arts"; where ''vernacular architecture'' is still ''of the common people'' but may be built by trained professionals such as through an [[apprenticeship]], but still using local, traditional designs and materials. ''Traditional architecture'' is architecture is passed down from person to person, generation to generation, particularly orally, but at any level of society, not just by common people. Noble discourages use of the term ''primitive architecture'' as having a negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Allen George. ''Traditional buildings: a global survey of structural forms and cultural functions''. London: I. B. Tauris, 2007. 1-17. Print.{{ISBN|9781845113056}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term popular architecture is used more in eastern Europe and is synonymous with folk or vernacular architecture.&lt;ref&gt;The meanings in this paragraph are supported by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009. Vernacular, a. and n., 6.; Folk 2. a.; Tradition, n., 4. a.; Traditional, a. (n.), 1. a.; Popular, a.(n.), 2. a.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Ronald Brunskill]] has defined the ultimate in vernacular architecture as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...a building designed by an amateur without any training in design; the individual will have been guided by a series of conventions built up in his locality, paying little attention to what may be fashionable. The function of the building would be the dominant factor, aesthetic considerations, though present to some small degree, being quite minimal. Local materials would be used as a matter of course, other materials being chosen and imported quite exceptionally.&lt;ref&gt;Brunskill, 2000 pages 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The vernacular architecture is not to be confused with so-called "traditional" architecture, though there are links between the two. Traditional architecture also includes buildings which bear elements of [[polite design]]: [[temples]] and [[palaces]], for example, which normally would not be included under the rubric of "vernacular." In architectural terms, 'the vernacular' can be contrasted with '[[the polite]]', which is characterised by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated by a professional [[architect]] for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, examples occur which have some vernacular and some polite content,&lt;ref&gt;Brunskill, 2000, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; often making the differences between the vernacular and the polite a matter of degree.
[[File:TraditionalArchitectureTurzaLaRioja.jpg|thumb|Dwelling of [[half-timbered]] construction on stone foundation, [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain]]
The ''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'' defines vernacular architecture as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...comprising the dwellings and all other buildings of the people. Related to their environmental contexts and available resources they are customarily owner- or community-built, utilizing traditional technologies. All forms of vernacular architecture are built to meet specific needs, accommodating the values, economies and ways of life of the cultures that produce them.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World'', volume 1, page not cited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vernacular architecture is a broad, [[grassroots]] concept which encompasses fields of architectural study including aboriginal, indigenous, ancestral, rural, and ethnic architecture&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vernaculararchitecture.com/{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, a site which is part of http://www.ethnoarchitecture.org/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507021335/http://ethnoarchitecture.org/ |date=2013-05-07 }} accessed 5/2/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and is contrasted with the more intellectual architecture called polite, formal, or academic architecture just as [[folk art]] is contrasted with [[fine art]].
&lt;!--Better to keep this concise and include in country specific sections as article is expanded. In Japan, for example, not all pre-modern architecture is "vernacular," which would usually refer only to rural buildings and [[structures]]. In the [[US]], vernacular architecture might refer to a so-called craftsman [[bungalow]], fashionable in the nineteenth century, even though the bungalow as an architectural form did not originate in the US. "Vernacular" might even refer to a building like the 1848 Duncan House in [[Cooksville]], [[Wisconsin]]. --&gt;

==Vernacular and the architect==
Architecture designed by professional architects is usually not considered to be vernacular. Indeed, it can be argued that the very process of consciously designing a building makes it not vernacular. [[Paul Oliver]], in his book ''Dwellings'', states: "...it is contended that 'popular architecture' designed by professional architects or commercial builders for popular use, does not come within the compass of the vernacular".&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Oliver |title=Dwellings |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2003 |origyear= |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=0-7148-4202-8 |page= |pages= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} Oliver also offers the following simple definition of vernacular architecture: ''"the architecture of the people, and by the people, but not for the people."&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] described vernacular architecture as "Folk building growing in response to actual needs, fitted into environment by people who knew no better than to fit them with native feeling".&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|9}} suggesting that it is a primitive form of design, lacking intelligent thought, but he also stated that it was "for us better worth study than all the highly self-conscious academic attempts at the beautiful throughout Europe".

[[File:Velika planina 031.JPG|thumbnail|right|A post-World War II dwelling at the [[Big Pasture Plateau]], [[Slovenia]], designed by the architect [[Vlasto Kopač]] and based on the vernacular architecture of this mountainous area.]]

Since at least the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], many modern architects have studied vernacular buildings and claimed to draw inspiration from them, including aspects of the vernacular in their designs. In 1946, the [[Egypt]]ian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] was appointed to design the town of [[New Gourna]] near [[Luxor]]. Having studied traditional [[Nubian people|Nubian]] settlements and technologies, he incorporated the traditional mud brick vaults of the Nubian settlements in his designs. The experiment failed, due to a variety of social and economic reasons, but is the first recorded attempt by an architect to address the social and environmental requirements of building users by adopting the methods and forms of the vernacular.&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

In 1964 the exhibition ''Architecture Without Architects'' was put on at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]] by [[Bernard Rudofsky]]. Accompanied by a book of the same title, including black-and-white photography of vernacular buildings around the world, the exhibition was extremely popular. It was Rudofsky who first made use of the term vernacular in an architectural context, and brought the concept into the eye of the public and of mainstream architecture: "For want of a generic label we shall call it vernacular, anonymous, spontaneous, indigenous, rural, as the case may be."&lt;ref name=Rudofsky&gt;Rudofsky, ''Architecture Without Architects'', page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the emergence of the term in the 1970s, vernacular considerations have played an increasing part in architectural designs, although individual architects had widely varying opinions of the merits of the vernacular.

Sri Lankan architect [[Geoffrey Bawa]] is considered the pioneer of regional modernism in [[South Asia]]. Along with him, modern proponents of the use of the vernacular in architectural design include [[Charles Correa]], a well known Indian architect; [[Muzharul Islam]] and [[Bashirul Haq]], internationally known [[List of Bangladeshi architects|Bangladeshi architects]]; [[Balkrishna Doshi]], another Indian, who established the Vastu-Shilpa Foundation in [[Ahmedabad]] to research the vernacular architecture of the region; and [[Sheila Sri Prakash]] who has used rural Indian architecture as an inspiration for innovations in environmental and socio-economically sustainable design and planning. The Dutch architect [[Aldo van Eyck]] was also a proponent of vernacular architecture.&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|13}} Architects whose work exemplifies the modern take on vernacular architecture would be [[Samuel Mockbee]], [[Christopher Alexander]] and [[Paolo Soleri]].

Oliver claims that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As yet there is no clearly defined and specialized discipline for the study of dwellings or the larger compass of vernacular architecture. If such a discipline were to emerge it would probably be one that combines some of the elements of both architecture and anthropology with aspects of history and geography&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Architects have developed a renewed interest in vernacular architecture as a model for sustainable design. &lt;ref&gt;Forster, W., Heal, A. and Paradise, C.,  "The Vernacular as a Model for Sustainable Design" Chapter 14 in: W. Weber, S. Yannas, ''Lessons from Vernacular Architecture'', Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on the vernacular==
[[File:Brgule 001.jpg|thumb|House in [[Brgule]], Serbia]]
Vernacular architecture is influenced by a great range of different aspects of human behaviour and environment, leading to differing building forms for almost every different context; even neighbouring villages may have subtly different approaches to the construction and use of their dwellings, even if they at first appear the same. Despite these variations, every building is subject to the same laws of physics, and hence will demonstrate significant similarities in [[structural engineering|structural forms]].

===Climate===
One of the most significant influences on vernacular architecture is the macro climate of the area in which the building is constructed. Buildings in cold climates invariably have high thermal mass or significant amounts of insulation. They are usually sealed in order to prevent heat loss, and openings such as windows tend to be small or non-existent. Buildings in warm climates, by contrast, tend to be constructed of lighter materials and to allow significant cross-ventilation through openings in the fabric of the building.

[[File:Múzeum kysuckej dediny-1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[log cabin]] in the region of [[Kysuce]] ([[Slovakia]]) - an example of vernacular architecture in relatively cold mountain climate using local materials ([[wood]]).]]
Buildings for a continental climate must be able to cope with significant variations in temperature, and may even be altered by their occupants according to the seasons. In hot arid and semi-arid regions, vernacular structures typically include a number of distinctive elements to provide for ventilation and temperature control. Across the middle-east, these elemens included such design features as courtyards gardens with water features, scree                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  n walls, reflected light, ''[[mashrabiya]]'' (the distinctive [[oriel window]] with timber lattice-work) and ''bad girs'' ([[Windcatcher|wind-catchers]]).&lt;ref name=archinform&gt;{{archINFORM|arch|10796}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Queenslander home, Australia.jpg|thumb|Queenslander, Australia]]
Buildings take different forms depending on precipitation levels in the region – leading to dwellings on stilts in many regions with frequent flooding or rainy monsoon seasons. For example, the [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] is an elevated weatherboard house with a sloped, tin roof that evolved in the early 19th-century as a solution to the annual flooding caused by monsoonal rain in Australia's northern states.&lt;ref name="LinOsb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osborne|first1=Lindy|title=Sublime design: the Queenslander|url=http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/features/comment/sublime-design-the-queenslander|website=Architecture &amp; Design|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat roofs are rare in areas with high levels of precipitation. Similarly, areas with high winds will lead to specialised buildings able to cope with them, and buildings tend to present minimal surface area to prevailing winds and are often situated low on the landscape to minimise potential storm damage.

Climatic influences on vernacular architecture are substantial and can be extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that of much of the Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by water mist and evaporation is drawn through the building by the natural ventilation set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work. Vernacular Architecture is also used for the purposes of local citizens.

===Culture===
The way of life of building occupants, and the way they use their shelters, is of great influence on building forms. The size of family units, who shares which spaces, how food is prepared and eaten, how people interact and many other cultural considerations will affect the layout and size of dwellings.

For example, the family units of several East African ethnic communities live in family compounds, surrounded by marked boundaries, in which separate single-roomed dwellings are built to house different members of the family. In polygamous communities there may be separate dwellings for different wives, and more again for sons who are too old to share space with the women of the family. Social interaction within the family is governed by, and privacy is provided by, the separation between the structures in which family members live. By contrast, in Western Europe, such separation is accomplished inside one dwelling, by dividing the building into separate rooms.

Culture also has a great influence on the appearance of vernacular buildings, as occupants often decorate buildings in accordance with local customs and beliefs.

====Nomadic dwellings====
[[File:cempa stilthouses.jpg|thumb|Stilt houses in Cempa, located in the [[Lingga Islands]] of Indonesia.]]
[[File:Yurt-construction-2.JPG|thumb|A [[Yurt]] or ger, a circular dwelling from [[Mongolia]], during erection]]
[[File:igloo.jpg|thumb|An unfinished [[Igloo]], an [[Inuit]] winter dwelling]]
There are many cultures around the world which include some aspect of nomadic life, and they have all developed vernacular solutions for the need for shelter. These all include appropriate responses to climate and customs of their inhabitants, including practicalities of simple construction such as [[Hut (dwelling)|huts]], and if necessary, transport such as [[tent]]s.

The [[Inuit]] people have a number of different forms of shelter appropriate to different seasons and geographical locations, including the [[igloo]] (for winter) and the [[tupiq]] (for summer). The [[Sami people|Sami]] of Northern Europe, who live in climates similar to those experienced by the Inuit, have developed different shelters appropriate to their culture&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|25}} including the [[lavvu]] and [[goahti]]. The development of different solutions in similar circumstances because of cultural influences is typical of vernacular architecture.

Many nomadic people use materials common in the local environment to construct temporary dwellings, such as the Punan of Sarawak who use palm fronds, or the Ituri Pygmies who use saplings and mongongo leaves to construct domed huts. Other cultures reuse materials, transporting them with them as they move. Examples of this are the tribes of Mongolia, who carry their [[yurt|gers]] (yurts) with them, or the black desert tents of the Qashgai in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="Oliver2003"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Notable in each case is the significant impact of the availability of materials and the availability of pack animals or other forms of transport on the ultimate form of the shelters.

All the shelters are adapted to suit the local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are versatile enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A traditional [[Berbers|Berber]] tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle – and because of the climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Permanent dwellings====
[[File:Lesotho Slide Show (294).JPG|thumb|A Southern African rondavel (or banda)]]

The type of structure and materials used for a dwelling vary depending on how permanent it is. Frequently moved nomadic structures will be lightweight and simple, more permanent ones will be less so. When people settle somewhere permanently, the architecture of their dwellings will change to reflect that.

Materials used will become heavier, more solid and more durable. They may also become more complicated and more expensive, as the capital and labour required to construct them is a one-time cost. Permanent dwellings often offer a greater degree of protection and shelter from the elements. In some cases however, where dwellings are subjected to severe weather conditions such as frequent flooding or high winds, buildings may be deliberately "designed" to fail and be replaced, rather than requiring the uneconomical or even impossible structures needed to withstand them. The collapse of a relatively flimsy, lightweight structure is also less likely to cause serious injury than a heavy structure.

Over time, dwellings' architecture may come to reflect a very specific geographical locale.

===Environment, construction elements and materials===
The local environment and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California [[Cupressaceae|redwood]] water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding [[Tankhouse|(tankhouses)]] were part of a self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.

Construction elements and materials frequently found in vernacular buildings include:
* [[Adobe]] - a type of mud brick, often covered with white-wash, commonly used in Spain and Spanish colonies
* [[Windcatcher|Bad girs]] -a type of chimney used to provide natural ventilation, commonly found in Iran, Iraq and other parts of the Middle-East
* [[Cob (material)|Cob]] - a type of plaster made from subsoil with the addition of fibrous material to give added strength
* [[Mashrabiya]] - (also known as shanashol in Iraq) - a type of oriel window with timber lattice-work, designed to allow ventilation, commonly found in Iraq and Egypt in upper-class homes
* [[Mudbrick|Mud brick]]s - loam or sand mixed with water and vegetable matter such as straw
* [[Rammed earth]] often used in foundations
* [[Thatching|Thatch]] - dry vegetation used as roofing material
* [[Wychert]] - a blend of white earth and clay

==Literature==
Following the eclipse by [[International Modernism]] of turn-of-the 20th century vernacular-inspired British and American [[Arts and Crafts]] buildings and European [[National Romanticism]], an early work in the renewed defense of vernacular was [[Bernard Rudofsky]]'s 1964 book ''[[Architecture Without Architects|Architecture Without Architects: a short introduction to non-pedigreed architecture]]'', based on his [[MoMA]] exhibition.  The book was a reminder of the legitimacy and "hard-won knowledge" inherent in vernacular buildings, from [[Wieliczka|Polish salt-caves]] to gigantic [[Syria]]n water wheels to [[Morocco|Moroccan]] desert fortresses, and was considered [[iconoclastic]] at the time.  Rudofsky was, however, very much a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] who viewed native populations in a historical bubble of contentment.  Rudofsky's book was also based largely on [[photographs]] and not on on-site study.

A more nuanced work is the ''[[Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World]]'' edited in 1997 by [[Paul Oliver]] of the Oxford Institute for [[Sustainable Development]]. Oliver argues that vernacular architecture, given the insights it gives into issues of environmental adaptation, will be necessary in the future to "ensure sustainability in both cultural and economic terms beyond the short term." [[Christopher Alexander]], in his book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', attempted to identify adaptive features of traditional architecture that apply across cultures. [[Howard Davis (architect)|Howard Davis]]'s book ''[[The Culture of Building]]'' details the culture that enabled several vernacular traditions.

Some extend the term vernacular to include any architecture outside the [[academic]] mainstream. The term "commercial vernacular", popularized in the late 1960s by the publication of [[Robert Venturi]]'s "Learning from Las Vegas", refers to 20th-century American [[suburban]] tract and commercial architecture. There is also the concept of an "industrial vernacular" with its emphasis on the [[aesthetics]] of [[Workshop|shops]], [[automobile repair shop|garages]] and [[factories]]. Some have linked vernacular with "off-the-shelf" aesthetics. In any respect, those who study these types of vernaculars hold that the low-end characteristics of this aesthetic define a useful and fundamental approach to architectural design.

Among those who study vernacular architecture are those who are interested in the question of everyday life and those lean toward questions of [[sociology]]. In this, many were influenced by [[The Practice of Everyday Life]] (1984) by [[Michel de Certeau]].

==Humanitarian response==
[[File:Sutyagin house 1.JPG|thumb|"[[Sutyagin House]]", a wooden single-family house – declared illegal by the city of [[Arkhangelsk]] because of the fire hazard]]
An appreciation of vernacular architecture is increasingly seen as vital in the immediate response to [[disasters]] and the following construction of [[transitional shelter]] if it is needed. The work [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008030543/http://www.sheltercentre.org/shelterlibrary/publications/112.htm Transitional Settlement: Displaced Populations], produced by [http://www.sheltercentre.org/ Shelter Centre] covers the use of vernacular in [[humanitarian]] response and argues its importance.

The value of housing displaced people in shelters which are in some way familiar is seen to provide reassurance and comfort following often very traumatic times. As the needs change from saving lives to providing medium to long term shelter the construction of locally appropriate and accepted housing can be very important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6202363.stm "NGOs criticise tsunami shelters"] ''BBC News'' – 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
As many jurisdictions introduce tougher [[building code]]s and [[zoning]] regulations, "folk architects" sometimes find themselves in conflict with the local authorities.

A case that made news in Russia was that of an [[Arkhangelsk]] entrepreneur Nikolay P. Sutyagin, who built what was reportedly the world's tallest single-family wooden house for himself and his family, only to see it condemned as a fire hazard. The 13-storey, {{convert|144|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} tall&lt;ref name=wan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to other sources, 12 stories, {{convert|38|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;/ref&gt; structure, known locally as [[Sutyagin house|"Sutyagin's skyscraper"]] ([[:ru:Небоскрёб Сутягина|Небоскрёб Сутягина]]), was found to be in violation of [[Arkhangelsk]] building codes, and in 2008 the courts ordered the building to be demolished by February 1, 2009.&lt;ref name=wan&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=914 Sutyagin House, Arkhangelsk, Russia: Standing tall].

In its broadest sense, vocology is the study of voice, but as a professional discipline it has a narrower focus: the science and practice of voice habilitation, which includes evaluation, diagnosis, and intervention.

==History==

Vocology was invented (simultaneously, but independently) by [[Ingo Titze]], and an [[otolaryngologist]] at [[Washington University]], Prof. George Gates.&lt;ref name="Titze96"/&gt; Titze defines vocology as "the science and practice of voice habilitation, with a strong emphasis on habilitation". To habilitate means to “enable”, to “equip for”, to “capacitate”; in other words, to assist in performing whatever function that needs to be performed". He goes on that this "is more than repairing a voice or bringing it back to a former state ... rather, it is the process of strengthening and equipping the voice to meet very specific and special demands".&lt;ref name="Titze96"/&gt;

==Requirements==

It is not yet its own professional degree, thus it only assists the voice medicine team. Usually a person practicing vocology is a voice coach with additional training in the voice medical arts, a prepared voice/singing teacher, or a speech pathologist with additional voice performance training—so they can better treat the professional voice user. The study of vocology is recognized academically by courses and institutes in India, Italy and the United States.

Reflecting the increased recognition of vocology, the ''Scandinavian Journal of Logopedics &amp; Phoniatrics'' and ''Voice'' merged in 1996 with the new name ''Logopedics, Phoniatrics, Vocology''.&lt;ref&gt;Kjær BE.

[[File:Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) new logo 2014.png|thumb|right|The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation was established in 1925.]]

'''The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation''' is the independent [[nonprofit]] [[technology transfer]] organization serving the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and [[Morgridge Institute for Research]]. It provides significant [[research]] support, granting tens of millions of dollars to the university each year and contributing to the university's "margin of excellence".

==History==
WARF was founded in 1925 to manage a discovery by [[Harry Steenbock]], who invented the process for using [[ultraviolet radiation]] to add [[vitamin D]] to [[milk]] and other foods. Rather than leaving the invention un[[patent]]ed&amp;mdash;then the standard practice for university inventions&amp;mdash;Steenbock used $300 of his own money to file for a patent. He received commercial interest from [[Quaker Oats]] but declined the company's initial offer.

Instead, Steenbock sought a way to protect discoveries made by UW-Madison faculty, ensure use of the ideas for public benefit and bring any financial gains back to the university. His concept gained support from Harry L. Russell, dean of the College of Agriculture, and Charles Sumner Slichter, dean of the Graduate School.

Slichter began soliciting the interest and financial support of wealthy UW-Madison alumni acquaintances in Chicago and New York. He gained a substantial sum in verbal pledges from a number of alumni, nine of whom would eventually contribute $100 each.

The UW [[Board of Regents]] approved the plan on June 22, 1925, and the organization's [[charter]] was filed with the [[Secretary of State of Wisconsin]] on November 14 that same year. The organization was named the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation to reflect both its governing body of five UW–Madison alumni and its mission to promote, encourage and aid scientific investigation and research at UW-Madison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Apple|first1=Rima D.|title=Patenting University Research: Harry Steenbock and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation|journal=Isis|date=September 1989|volume=80|issue=3|pages=374–394|doi=10.1086/355081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, WARF has helped steward the cycle of research, discovery, commercialization and investment for UW–Madison. Through its patenting and licensing efforts, WARF enables university innovations to advance from the lab to the marketplace.

Each year, WARF contributes more than $70 million to fund additional UW–Madison research. The university refers to WARF's annual gifts as its "margin of excellence" funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muehl|first1=Ann|title=WARF grants more than $70 million to support UW-Madison|url=http://news.wisc.edu/23197|website=UW-Madison|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARF currently licenses nearly 100 UW–Madison technologies each year. As of 2014, WARF had an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of $2.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WARF Endowment|url=http://www.warf.org/stewardship/endowment/endowment.cmsx|website=WARF|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WARF also works in partnership with a variety of other entities including WiSys Technology Foundation, [[WiCell]] Research Institute and the [[Morgridge Institute for Research]].

==WARF inventions==
From the early discoveries related to vitamin D and development of the blood thinner warfarin to the derivation of stem cells and algorithms that speed computer processing, UW–Madison inventions have changed lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tenenbaum|first1=David|title=Innovation marks UW-Madison contribution to vitamins, drugs, medical supplies|url=http://news.wisc.edu/19542|website=UW-Madison|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More than eight decades in the making, partnership still going strong|url=http://www.warf.org/about-us/success-stories/success-stories.cmsx|website=WARF|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kerber|first1=Andrew|title=Decades of Discovery|url=http://wisconsinengineer.com/magazine/1235/1168/|website=Wisconsin Engineer|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamin D===
In 1923, Harry Steenbock and [[James Cockwell]] discovered exposure to [[ultraviolet light]] increased the Vitamin D concentration in food.  After discovering that irradiated [[rat]] food cured the rats of [[rickets]], Steenbock sought a patent.  Steenbock then assigned the patent to the newly established Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.  WARF then licensed the technology to Quaker Oats for use in their [[breakfast cereal]]s. In addition, WARF licensed the technology for use as a pharmaceutical, [[Viosterol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shah|first1=Angela|title=Q&amp;A: How WARF Plans to Stay Relevant in Lean Times for Tech Transfer|url=http://www.xconomy.com/wisconsin/2013/12/20/qa-warf-plans-stay-relevant-lean-times-tech-transfer/|website=Xconomy|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WARF's commercialization of Vitamin D culminated in its enrichment of milk.

By the time the patent expired in 1945, rickets was all but nonexistent.

Through continued innovations from [[Hector DeLuca]], vitamin D remains an important part of WARF's technology portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Nicole|title=Vitamin D–The Hype and the Hope|url=http://grow.cals.wisc.edu/health/vitamin-d-the-hype-and-the-hope|website=Grow|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warfarin===
[[Warfarin]], also known as Coumadin, is named for WARF, and the story of its discovery is emblematic of the "[[Wisconsin Idea]]" and the relationship of the university to the Wisconsin public. In 1933 a farmer from [[Deer Park, Wisconsin|Deer Park]] showed up unannounced at the School of Agriculture and walked into a professor's laboratory with a milk can full of blood which would not coagulate. In his truck, he had also brought a dead heifer and some spoiled clover hay. He wanted to know what had killed his cow. In 1941, [[Karl Paul Link]] successfully isolated the anticoagulant factor, which initially found commercial application as a [[rodent]]-killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meek|first1=Thomas|title=This month in 1939: How dead cattle led to the discovery of warfarin|url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/how_dead_cattle_led_to_the_discovery_of_warfarin_485464|website=PMLiVE|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warfarin is one of the most widely prescribed medicines in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Ming-Shien Wen and Ming Ta Michael Lee. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804835/ Warfarin Pharmacogenetics: New Life for an Old Drug]". ''Acta Cardiologica Sinica'', 29(3) (May 2013): 235–242. "has now become the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with deep vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, or prosthetic heart valve replacement"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Munir Pirmohamed. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1885167/ Warfarin: almost 60 years old and still causing problems]". ''British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology'', 62(5) (November 2006): 509–511. "Warfarin is now the most widely used anticoagulant in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; used in vascular and heart disease to prevent stroke and [[thrombosis]].

===Stem cells===
More recently, WARF was assigned the patents for non-human primate and human embryonic [[stem cells]].  The stem cells were first isolated and purified by [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=James|title=Embryonic Stem Cell Lines Derived from Human Blastocysts|journal=Science|date=November 6, 1998|volume=282|issue=5391|pages=1145–1147|doi=10.1126/science.282.5391.1145|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/282/5391/1145.full|accessdate=24 February 2015|pmid=9804556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Startup companies==
WARF has also helped establish more than 60 [[startup company|startup companies]] including Imago, Mirus Bio, Nimblegen, Tomotherapy, Deltanoid Pharmaceuticals, Quinntessence, Neoclone, Silatronix, Third Wave Technologies, Cambria Biosciences, and OpGen, Inc.

== Patent litigation ==
WARF was called a "[[patent troll]]" by ''[[Business Insider]]'', which included WARF in a list of the "most fearsome" of them. The magazine noted that while many universities could be described as  "patent trolls", WARF was singled out because of the large number of patents it held. A WARF spokesperson denied that the group acted as a non-participating entity, explaining that "our whole purpose for being is to bring inventions from the university into the world into practical use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tech's 8 Most Fearsome 'Patent Trolls'|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-patent-holding-companies-2012-11|date=2012-11-25|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Practicing Entities in Cleantech |url=http://www.cleantechpatentedge.com/2012/10/non-practicing-entities-in-cleantech/ |date=2012-10-16 |accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Are Universities Patent Trolls?|journal=Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal|date=Spring 2008|volume=611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, WARF filed a lawsuit against [[Apple Inc.]], alleging that it had infringed {{patent|US|5781752}}, "Table based data speculation circuit for parallel processing computer", on its [[Apple A7]] and [[Apple A8]] [[system-on-chip]] products. In October 2015, Apple was found liable;&lt;ref name=ars-a7patentswisconsin&gt;{{cite news|author=Joe Mullin |title=Apple faces $862M patent damage claim from University of Wisconsin |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=October 14, 2015 |accessdate=October 14, 2015 |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/apple-faces-862m-patent-damage-claim-from-university-of-wisconsin/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2017, Apple was ordered to pay WARF $506 million for patent infringement. The patent expired in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ip-apple-patent-idUSKBN1AB023 |title=Apple ordered to pay $506 million to university in patent dispute |last=Wolfe |first=Jan |publisher=Reuters |date=July 25, 2017 |accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
