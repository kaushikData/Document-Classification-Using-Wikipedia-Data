'''Abul Kashem Khan''' (best known as '''A. K. Khan'''; 5 April 1905 – 31 March 1991) was a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]-[[Bangladeshi]] lawyer, industrialist and politician. In 1945, he founded [[A K Khan &amp; Company]], one of Pakistan's leading [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] until 1971, when it became one of Bangladesh's leading conglomerates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Islam|first1=Sirajul|title=Khan, Abul Kashem|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Khan,_Abul_Kashem|website=banglapedia|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan served as a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] and the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]]. He was a federal minister of [[Pakistan]] and member in the [[Pakistan National Assembly]].

== Early life ==
Khan was born in the Village of Mohara in [[Panchlaish Thana|Panchlaish]] in [[Chittagong]] in 1905. His father was a government sub-registrar at Fatehabad, Chittagong. He studied law at [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]], [[Calcutta]]. In 1934 he joined the Kolkata High court as an advocate. He joined the judicial branch of the Bengali Civil service in 1935. He continued in the service till 1944.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Career ==
Khan entered business during the [[Second World War]] in 1945, when Chittagong was a key base for Allied Forces. He step up a number of industries including a match factory, a plywood factory, a textile mill, and dockyard. He was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of India from the [[All-India Muslim League]] candidate in 1946. He joined the Pakistan Constituent Assembly after the partition of India. In 1951-1952 budget he spoke against the economical discrimination of East Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

''"Sir, I cannot help' remark ' which I hope will not be misinterpreted as an indication of petty provincial-mindedness. Sir, these are the days of decentralisation and regional self-sufficiency. We find that in this six-year plan, the total sum allocated to East Bengal where 56 percent of your people live is less than 23 percent. Under the head 'Agriculture', provision has been made for 82 crores and a sum total of all the projects envisaged for East Bengal is only 5.6 crores. Under the head 'Development of Hydro-Electric Power', a provision for 45 crores has been made and the share of East Bengal is only 5 crores. Under the head 'Industries', provision has been made for textile industries' [for West Pakistan] to the tune of 30 crores and the provision for jute industry' [for East Bengal] is only 11 crores. Now, Sir, this gives a clear indication that not only in the past, not only in the present, but in the future development plans of the country, East Bengal is not expected to get its legitimate share."''&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Szfqq7ruqWgC|title=Bangladesh: Past and Present|last=Ahmed|first=Salahuddin|date=2004-01-01|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=9788176484695|page=337|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy''' (also known as the '''circular transactions controversy''') began in Dublin in December 2008 when [[Seán FitzPatrick]], the chairman of [[Anglo Irish Bank]] (the state's third-largest bank), admitted he had hidden a total of [[Euro|€]]87 million in loans from the bank, triggering a series of incidents which led to the eventual [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of Anglo on 21 January 2009. FitzPatrick subsequently resigned his position and was followed within twenty-four hours by the bank's non-executive director, [[Lar Bradshaw]] and chief executive, [[David Drumm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1219/anglo-business.html|title=Drumm quits Anglo in loans fall-out|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new chairman of Anglo, [[Donal O'Connor]], was quickly appointed from the board, a move welcomed by the Irish [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]], [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]]. A number of investigations have been launched into the reasons behind the three resignations. The [[Central Bank of Ireland]] is carrying out a review of the bank's dealings, although its [[Financial Regulator]], [[Patrick Neary]], has also since resigned his position. So too did a number of other chairmen, directors and executives involved with Anglo, [[Irish Life and Permanent]] and [[Irish Nationwide]].

Within days of the initial admission, an announcement was made that Anglo Irish Bank would be one of three (alongside [[Allied Irish Bank]] and [[Bank of Ireland]]) that would be recapitalised by the [[Irish government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/bank.html|title=Bank move a good deal for taxpayers: Lenihan|date=22 December 2008|accessdate=22 December 2008|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222215745/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1222/bank.html|archivedate= 22 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was expected to be effected in mid-January 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialregulator.ie/frame_main.asp?pg=%2Fnews%2Fnw%5Farticle%2Easp%3Fid%3D440&amp;nv=%2Fnews%2Fnw%5Fnav%2Easp |title=Bank Government Announcement on Recapitalisation |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |publisher=[[Financial Regulator]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129125817/http://www.financialregulator.ie/frame_main.asp?pg=%2Fnews%2Fnw_article.asp%3Fid%3D440&amp;nv=%2Fnews%2Fnw_nav.asp |archivedate=29 January 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; following an [[Extraordinary General Meeting]] (EGM). Lenihan instead unexpectedly announced the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank the night before the EGM due to difficulties he encountered with the recapitalisation process. Recapitalisations of the other two banks mentioned were expected by the end of March 2009 but, according to [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]], were expected to be finalised in early February 2009 at a total of €7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0207/economy.html|title=Bank recapitalisation finalised soon - Cowen|date=7 February 2009|accessdate=7 February 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208193317/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0207/economy.html|archivedate=8 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank on 21 January 2009 followed two more resignations earlier that month. On 7 January 2009, another director, [[Willie McAteer]], resigned, becoming the fourth casualty of the controversy. Two days later the Financial Regulator Patrick Neary retired amidst much criticism over his handling of the affair. After the nationalisation, the Chairman of Irish Nationwide, Dr Michael Walsh, resigned on 17 February, one week to the day that government-appointed directors announced they were investigating a deposit of billions of euro by Irish Life and Permanent, placed in Anglo Irish Bank before the end of its financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0210/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo directors probe 'billions' deposit|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=10 February 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoiseach Brian Cowen denied claims that he was protecting a "[[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy#The "Golden Circle"|Golden Circle]]" of wealthy financiers from being identified. This mysterious group of ten businessmen is said{{By whom|date=March 2011}} to have received loans from Anglo Irish Bank in return for buying shares, in a move designed to keep the bank afloat.

==Background==
Starting in 1986, Seán "Seanie" FitzPatrick spent eighteen years as chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, during which time the bank grew from a small operator into the third-largest bank in Ireland. When he became the bank's chairman in 2005, handing over the position of chief executive to David Drumm, the bank was recording annual profits of over €500 million. The Anglo share price peaked at €17.60 in May 2007, an increase from under €1 ten years previously. Anglo was valued at nearly €13 billion and FitzPatrick's 4.5 million Anglo shares were worth nearly €80 million at this time. Prior to FitzPatrick's resignation, the Anglo share price had already dropped to €0.32, a drop of 98% with the entire bank valued at a low €242 million and FitzPatrick's stake reduced to €1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/seanie-turned-a-struggling-minnow-into-a-banking-giant-1580520.html|title='Seanie' turned a struggling minnow into a banking giant|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Financial Regulator first uncovered the €87 million loans in January 2008 when inspectors from the regulator's offices carried out an inspection into the loan book of rival lender, [[Irish Nationwide Building Society]]. The inspectors noticed that a large loan was provided to FitzPatrick at Anglo Irish Bank and later repaid. The Regulator discovered at a later date that similar loans were provided to FitzPatrick in September 2008 and repaid by him in October 2008. When the issue was raised with Anglo Irish Bank it was discovered that there were further loans between the two banks over an extended period of eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/1220/1229725700584.html|title=Regulator stumbled on loans during inspection of rival bank's books|date=20 December 2008|accessdate=20 December 2008|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain which officials, if any, within the bank knew about the loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/1220/1229725700319.html?via=rel|title=Anglo stays silent over who knew of loans|date=20 December 2008|accessdate=20 December 2008|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Anglo annual report contained a note displaying the total loans given to directors of the bank. This total was measured at a single point in time. In the case of Anglo this occurred on 30 September. FitzPatrick, instead of revealing the true figures of his loans, transferred some of them to [[Irish Nationwide Building Society]], returning them to Anglo at a later date. He acted in a manner that thwarted transparency of Anglo's loan book. Financial authorities investigated if there were breaches of corporate governance. The Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator said that "a lay person would expect that issues of this nature and this magnitude would have been picked up" by the external auditors, [[Ernst &amp; Young]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0114/1231738222989.html FitzPatrick Anglo loans were more than €87m]&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving legal advice Ernst &amp; Young declined to appear before a parliamentary committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0202/anglo-business.html|work=RTÉ News|title=Anglo auditors won't be at committee|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This in turn led to inaccurate figures for the total directors' loans given for eight consecutive years in the end of year Anglo accounts. 2008 was the first occasion on which FitzPatrick revealed his true figure, that of €87 million or twice the total of the other twelve directors' loan figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/why-directors-loans-fell-below-the-radar-1580570.html|title=Why directors' loans fell below the radar|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''|first=Maeve|last=Dineen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation was described as Ireland's version of [[Enron]], the American energy company which went bankrupt in 2001, and it was said that the principals would have been immediately arrested if this had occurred in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/financial-crisis/if-fitzpatrick-lived-in-new-york-hed---have-been-arrested-1605179.html If FitzPatrick lived in New York, he'd have been arrested]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resignations ==

=== Anglo Irish Bank ===
FitzPatrick issued a statement on the evening of 18 December 2008, linking his resignation with a €87 million loan he had from the bank. Ireland's Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan welcomed the appointment of a new chairman, Donal O'Connor, an official with a substantial commercial track record, saying he "seems a natural choice" for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1218/fitzpatricks.html|title=Chairman of Anglo Irish Bank resigns|date=18 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220080431/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1218/fitzpatricks.html|archivedate=20 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzPatrick's resignation came little over two months after he had admitted that his former bank had made mistakes but insisted it had not been "reckless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1004/bank.html|title=Mistakes made says Anglo Irish Bank chairman|date=4 October 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081223092341/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1004/bank.html|archivedate=23 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside FitzPatrick's resignation came that of Bradshaw who had held a loan jointly with FitzPatrick, a loan that was temporarily transferred to another bank prior to a year end audit without the knowledge of Bradshaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/anglo-chief-quits-after-hiding-euro87m--bank-loans-1580513.html|title=Anglo chief quits after hiding €87m bank loans|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=Irish Independent|first1=Maeve|last1=Dineen|first2=Brendan|last2=Keenan|first3=John|last3=Mulligan}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of 19 December, Drumm announced he would step down with immediate effect, but said he will continue to work with the chairman through a transition phase until a replacement chief executive is agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1219/angloirish.html|title=Anglo Irish chief third to resign|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221123534/http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1219/angloirish.html|archivedate=21 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is appropriate for me to step down today given last evening's announcement in relation to the resignation of Seán FitzPatrick and given the strong statement of support for the Bank and its recapitalisation programme by the Minister for Finance. Good progress is being made on the recapitalisation. It is undoubtedly in the best interests of Anglo that a new Chief Executive is appointed to lead the Bank through its next phase of development. The appointment of Donal O'Connor as Chairman together with a new Chief Executive augurs well for the Bank and for all its stakeholders. It gives the Bank fresh impetus and an upward trajectory. I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their intense commitment and honest endeavour and for their friendship over the last 15 years.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1219/breaking45.html?via=rel|title=Anglo Irish Bank statement on Drumm resignation|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=''The Irish Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 7 January 2009, Willie McAteer resigned his position as finance director and chief risk officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0107/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo Irish loses another director|date=7 January 2009|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2009 the Government of Ireland nationalised&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/taxpayer-is-picking-up--ailing-anglo-irish-bank-1603950.html Taxpayer is picking up ailing Anglo Irish Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/what-the-implications-are-for-savers-and-investors-as-state-takes-over-anglo-1603883.html What the implications are for savers and investors as State takes over Anglo]&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo Irish Bank and its shares were suspended on the Dublin and London Stock Exchanges.

On 19 January 2009, the balance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0119/breaking19.html Anglo Irish directors step down, bank downgraded]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Board, who had served while FitzPatrick was chairman, resigned.

===Financial Regulator===
Following reports of a communication breakdown at the office of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the [[Financial Regulator]] Patrick Neary on 9 January 2009 announced his decision to retire as of 31 January that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0109/nearyp.html|title=Neary to retire as Financial Regulator|date=9 January 2009|accessdate=10 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111100225/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0109/nearyp.html|archivedate= 11 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neary's weakness in dealing with the issue has received much criticism, with [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] Senator [[Dan Boyle (politician)|Dan Boyle]] calling for a strengthening of powers within the organisation and saying that confidence in Irish financial services had been eroded by events of the previous six months. Financial observers indicated that a replacement for Neary might have to be located in the United States or in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0110/finance.html|title=Greens call for stronger finance regulator|date=10 January 2009|accessdate=10 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090110204138/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0110/finance.html| archivedate=10 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dublin Airport Authority===
On the evening of 24 February 2009, the chairman of the [[Dublin Airport Authority]] (DAA), [[Gary McGann]], announced his decision to step down from the board, stating that his decision had been influenced by his former non-executive directorship of Anglo Irish Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0224/breaking76.htm|title=McGann steps down as chairman of DAA|date=24 February 2009|accessdate=24 February 2009|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome and nationalisation==
Anglo Irish Bank has said it would review its policy on directors' loans following FitzPatrick's resignation. The [[Financial Regulator]] announced he would be examining the loans issued by Anglo Irish Bank to all its directors, claiming he became aware of the existence of the loans "following an inspection earlier this year". Ultimately he became a victim of the controversy and subsequently announced his retirement.

The [[Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board]] (CARB) undertook an investigation into the "circumstances around the issue of inappropriate directors' loans at Anglo Irish"and into the performance of Ernst and Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carb.ie/uploads/John%20Purcell%20Appointment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317220157/http://www.carb.ie/uploads/John%20Purcell%20Appointment.pdf |archivedate=17 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Association of Investment Managers]] expressed how it was "surprised and disappointed" at the controversy and announced it would be writing to Anglo's new chairman to describe its worries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1219/breaking13.html?via=mr|title=Drumm resigns as chief executive of Anglo Irish|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=19 December 2008|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish State subsequently announced it was to become the majority shareholder in Anglo Irish Bank by injecting €3 billion into the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1220/1229728408863.html?via=rel|title=State plans €3bn capital injection into Anglo Irish Bank|date=20 December 2008|accessdate=20 December 2008|publisher=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition party [[Fine Gael]] opposed this move and stated on 14 January 2009 that the bank should be shut down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0114/banks.html|title=FG to oppose Anglo Irish recapitalisation|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=16 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115144251/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0114/banks.html|archivedate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the following evening the Irish government announced that recapitalisation was no longer a serious option and nationalised the bank instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0115/banks.html|title=Govt to take control of Anglo Irish Bank|date=15 January 2009|accessdate=16 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090116112513/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0115/banks.html|archivedate=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0116/1232059654021.html?via=rel Government nationalises 'fragile' Anglo Irish Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; Lenihan stated that "clear blue water" had been inserted between the old and new versions of Anglo and defended the nationalisation by saying that if the government were to let the bank fail it would be saying to Ireland and other economies that the country was "closed for business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0116/anglo2-business.html|title=Lenihan defends Anglo takeover move|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-01-16|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an Emergency General Meeting held at the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]], [[Dublin]] on 16 January 2009, the bank's shareholders angrily voiced their opinions on FitzPatrick's involvement in the bank's downfall and their lack of confidence in the banking sector.

===Legislation===
{{further|Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009}}
Emergency legislation to nationalise the bank, titled the [[Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009]], was voted through [[Dáil Éireann]], being approved by 79 &amp;ndash; 67 before passing in [[Seanad Éireann]] without a vote on 20 January 2009. During the Seanad's debate on the bill, Senator [[Shane Ross]] claimed that "no-one was being told the truth about Anglo Irish Bank" and called the EGM of the previous Friday "a disgrace show[ing] corporate Ireland at its worst, as there were no answers to any questions". Senator [[Joe O'Toole]] advocated the chasing of those responsible for the bank's nationalisation "even into the courts", saying that a person could be imprisoned for failure to pay a household bill, yet those who caused the loss of jobs and pensions might not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0120/angloirish.html|title=Dáil votes to nationalise Anglo Irish|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203113936/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0120/angloirish.html|archivedate=3 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Mary McAleese then signed the Anglo Irish Bank Bill at Áras an Uachtaráin the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0121/angloirish.html|title=McAleese signs Anglo Irish Bank Bill|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009|publisher=RTÉ|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090124000047/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0121/angloirish.html|archivedate=24 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discussion ===
The bank's internal auditors appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs on 3 February 2009 to discuss the nationalisation of [[Anglo Irish Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0129/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo Irish auditors to be questioned|date=2009-01-29|accessdate=2009-02-05|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank's head of internal audit, Walter Tyrrell, told the Oireachtas committee that the movement of loans by Seán FitzPatrick into the bank and back out again could only have been known by FitzPatrick himself and the executive of his account, claiming that loans were tested by means of random sampling and that FitzPatrick's loans had not once been selected - however one loan he held with a partner was chosen. Fine Gael's [[Kieran O'Donnell]] expressed his amazement that each of the directors' loans were not tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0203/anglo-business.html|title=Anglo director loans 'tested randomly'|date=2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-02-05|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2009, Lenihan revealed plans under which €3.5 billion ($4.5 billion, £3.1 billion) each would be provided by the government's purchase of [[Option (finance)#Long call|options]] intended to re-capitalise Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7884925.stm|title=Rescue plan for Ireland's banks|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2009-02-12|publisher=[[BBC]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090213134314/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7884925.stm| archivedate= 13 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

=== Review ===
The Financial Regulator, on the recommendation of the Irish Finance Minister, ordered an "urgent review" of directors' loans at Anglo Irish Bank, saying it has a "very serious view" of the issue. It claimed the loans were "first brought to its attention on December 17th 2008" and that a committee had been established to investigate the matter. Irish [[Minister for Social Protection|Minister for Social and Family Affairs]] [[Mary Hanafin]] said the Financial Regulator had "serious questions" to answer over its supposed lack of knowledge of the loans and the Irish [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government|Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] [[John Gormley]] asked the Financial Regulator to explain what he termed "extraordinary complacency" in relation to the situation at Anglo Irish Bank. The opposition party [[Fine Gael]]'s deputy leader and finance representative [[Richard Bruton]] quizzed the Minister for Finance on his announcement that he would provide the necessary capital to Anglo Irish Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1220/breaking24.htm|title=IFSRA board orders urgent review into Anglo loans|date=2008-12-20|accessdate=2008-12-20|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further Hidden Loans (Deposits) Controversy Involving Irish Life &amp; Permanent ===
On 12 February 2009, details of a further controversial transaction which had the effect of misrepresenting the end-of-year accounts of Anglo-Irish Bank came into the public domain. Anglo-Irish Bank lent €4bn to Irish Life &amp; Permanent (IL&amp;P) for 1 day by way of inter-bank loan, and a subsidiary of Irish Life placed a deposit of a similar amount with Anglo, which was recorded as a customer deposit.  Following a discussion with the Minister for Finance, a board meeting of IL&amp;P accepted the resignation of two senior IL&amp;P executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0213/breaking12.html?via=rel|title=Statement by Irish Life &amp; Permanent|date=2009-02-13|accessdate=2009-02-13|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Golden Circle" ===
On 17 February, Taoiseach Brian Cowen informed Dáil Éireann of his knowledge of a group of ten wealthy businessmen who had come together to buy shares in Anglo Irish Bank in 2008 in a transaction which is now at the centre of an investigation by the Office of Corporate Enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/angloirish.html|title=Anglo share purchases raised in Dáil|date=2009-02-17|accessdate=2009-02-18|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090218130912/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0217/angloirish.html| archivedate= 18 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowen has since denied suggestions put forth by the Opposition that he was attempting to protect anyone involved in this so-called "Golden Circle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0218/banks.html|title='Golden Circle' dominates Dáil proceedings|date=2009-02-18|accessdate=2009-02-18|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219201336/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0218/banks.html| archivedate= 19 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mystery has been discussed in Dáil Éireann since its revelation, with Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] leader [[John Gormley]] calling for the names to be made public if a legal way of doing so could be found.&lt;ref name="Golden Circle names should be public - Gormley"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0219/angloirish.html|title=Golden Circle names should be public - Gormley|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2009-02-19|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221035523/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0219/angloirish.html| archivedate= 21 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo Irish Bank's annual report alongside the PricewaterhouseCooper report on the bank were both published on 20 February but [[Tánaiste]] [[Mary Coughlan (politician)|Mary Coughlan]] stated beforehand that the ten would not be named in either report.&lt;ref name="Golden Circle names should be public - Gormley"/&gt; The Anglo report revealed that the bank lent €451 million to the ten "Golden Circle" clients, a 50% increase on previous estimates of €300 million.&lt;ref name="Anglo loaned €451m to 10 clients to buy bank shares"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0220/breaking14.html?via=mr|title=Anglo loaned €451m to 10 clients to buy bank shares|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2009-02-20|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same evening, Brian Lenihan also issued a statement containing extracts from the report carried out by PricewaterhouseCooper for the Financial Regulator.&lt;ref name="Lenihan statement on the PWC report"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0220/breaking86.htm|title=Lenihan statement on the PWC report|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2009-02-20|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The morning before its publication, [[Ulick McEvaddy]] appeared on [[RTÉ Radio 1]] alongside the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]]'s [[Joe Higgins]], where he stated that the ten were "heroes" in his opinion (Joe Higgins disagreed).&lt;ref name="McEvaddy praises Golden Circle 'heroes'"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0220/banks.html |title=McEvaddy praises Golden Circle 'heroes' |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2009-02-20 |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224073335/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0220/banks.html |archivedate=24 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McEvaddy defends Anglo Irish investor 'heroes'"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0220/breaking43.htm|title=McEvaddy defends Anglo Irish investor 'heroes'|date=2009-02-20|accessdate=2009-02-20|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' published the names of four of the Golden Circle members on 22 February.&lt;ref name="Four 'Golden Circle' named by newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0222/anglo.html|title=Four 'Golden Circle' named by newspaper|date=2009-02-22|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226105556/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0222/anglo.html| archivedate= 26 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four members of the elite are [[Gerry Gannon]], [[Joe O'Reilly (builder)|Joe O'Reilly]], Seamus Ross and [[Jerry Conlan]].

'''Bart Decrem''' is a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who, most recently, headed the Mobile Games business for [[The Walt Disney Company]] between July 2010 and the Fall of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1269265/billboard-qa-tapulous-co-founder-Decrem-decrem | title=Billboard Q&amp;A: Tapulous Co-Founder Bart Decrem|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born and raised in [[Belgium]].

== Early life ==
His first entrepreneurial venture was at the age of 13, when he started a weekly magazine for Belgium’s leading underground radio station while working as a DJ there. Decrem moved to the US to study law at Stanford University. After graduation, Decrem founded Plugged In, a non-profit organization in East Palo Alto that provided community members with Internet access and related educational programs. Plugged In was one of the first such Digital Divide programs in the United States.

== Career ==
In 1999, Decrem co-founded [[Eazel]], an open source [[Linux]] desktop start-up. Their software, Nautilus, continues to be popular among Linux users. Among other projects, he coordinated the creation of the [[GNOME Foundation]]. After Eazel shut down in 2001, Decrem spent 18 months in Seoul, doing business development for several local startups.

In 2003-2004, Decrem headed marketing and business affairs for the [[Mozilla Foundation]]. He coordinated [[Firefox]] marketing activities, including branding, the Firefox 1.0 launch and the creation of Spread Firefox, the community marketing effort for Firefox. He also headed up partnerships with [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and [[Mozilla]]. His work for Mozilla was sponsored by [[Mitch Kapor]]’s Open Source Applications Foundation.

After leaving Mozilla, he started [[Flock, Inc.|Flock]], a startup building a social web browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/10/24/new-social-web-browser-based-on-firefox | title=New 'Social' Web Browser Based on Firefox|work=[[FoxNews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/applications/flock-founder-hopes-new-browser-will-fly-users-752 | title=Flock founder hopes new browser will fly with users|work=[[InfoWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angel investors in Flock included [[Josh Kopelman]], [[Gil Penchina]], [[Joe Kraus]], [[Scott Kurnit]], [[Stratton Sclavos]] and others. VC investors included [[Bessemer Venture Partners]], Catamount Ventures and Shasta Ventures. He was Flock’s CEO through its Series C, and left the company in the Summer of 2006.

In 2007, Decrem worked as an Entrepreneur In Residence at DCM (Doll Capital Management).

In January, 2008, Bart Decrem was Founder and CEO at [[Tapulous]], one of the first iPhone startups. [[Andrew Lacy]] was the Co-Founder at [[Tapulous]]. Tapulous is the company behind [[Tap Tap Revenge]]
one of the first major game hits on the App Store.

In April, 2009, [[comScore]] announced that Tap Tap Revenge was the most popular App Store app of all times on the occasion on Apple’s announcement of the first one billion app downloads. At that time, according to comScore, Tap Tap Revenge was installed on 32% of all iPhones in the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/technology/start-ups/22tap.html | title=Music Games for iPhone Give Artists New Spotlight| work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ir.comscore.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=375787 | title=Top 25 All-Time iPhone Apps Mostly Games| work=[[ComScore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Berry Gordy III (also known as Berry Gordy Jr.) was &lt;!--the seventh of eight children (Fuller, [[Esther Gordy Edwards|Esther]], [[Anna Gordy Gaye|Anna]], Loucye, George, [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua|Gwen]], ''Berry'' and [[Robert Gordy|Robert]]),--&gt; born on November 28, 1929&lt;ref name=biography&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/berry-gordy-jr-9316017 Berry Gordy Jr. Biography, ''Biography.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; in Detroit, to the middle-class [[Gordy family|family of Berry Gordy II]] (also known as Berry Gordy Sr.), who had relocated to Detroit from [[Oconee, Georgia|Oconee]] in Washington County, Georgia, in 1922.&lt;ref name="Bayles" /&gt; The first Berry Gordy was the son of a white plantation owner, James Gordy, in Georgia and his female slave. His half-brother, James, was the grandfather of President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Berry Gordy II was lured to Detroit by the job opportunities for black people offered by the booming automotive businesses.&lt;ref name="Bayles" /&gt;
&lt;!--Berry dropped out of high school in the eleventh grade to become a professional [[boxing|boxer]] in hopes of becoming rich quick,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} a career he followed until 1950, when he was drafted by the [[United States Army]] for service in the [[Korean War]]. Arriving in Korea in May 1952, Gordy was first assigned to the 58th Field Artillery Bn., 3rd Inf. Div., near Panmunjom. He later became a chaplain’s assistant, driving a jeep and playing the organ at religious services at the front. His tour in the Korean War was completed in April 1953.

After his return from Korea in 1953, he married Thelma Coleman.--&gt;Gordy Jr. developed his interest in music by writing songs and opening the 3-D Record Mart, a record store featuring jazz music and 3-D glasses.&lt;ref name=DesertIsland&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07bt72r |title=BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, Berry Gordy |author=BBC |date=22 May 2016 |access-date=25 May 2016 |quote=I was heavily into Jazz and so I opened up this Jazz record store, and in Detroit the people that came in there were asking for the Blues}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store was unsuccessful, and Gordy sought work at the [[Lincoln-Mercury]] plant, but his family connections put him in touch with Al Green (no relation to the singer Reverend [[Al Green]]), owner of the Flame Show Bar Talent Club, where he met the singer [[Jackie Wilson]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1957 Wilson recorded "[[Reet Petite]]", a song Gordy had co-written with his sister Gwen and writer-producer [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Billy Davis]]. It became a modest hit, but had more success internationally, especially in the UK, where it reached the Top 10 and even later topped the chart on re-issue in 1986. Wilson recorded six more songs co-written by Gordy over the next two years, including "[[Lonely Teardrops]]", which topped the R&amp;B charts and got to number 7 in the pop chart. Berry and Gwen Gordy also wrote "[[All I Could Do Was Cry]]" for [[Etta James]] at [[Chess Records]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Motown Record Corporation==
{{main|Motown}}

Gordy reinvested the profits from his songwriting success into producing. In 1957, he discovered [[the Miracles]] (originally known as the Matadors) and began building a portfolio of successful artists. In 1959, with the encouragement of Miracles leader [[Smokey Robinson]], Gordy borrowed $800 from his family to create an R&amp;B record company. Originally, Gordy wanted to name the new label Tammy Records, after [[Tammy (song)|the song]] recorded by [[Debbie Reynolds]]. However, that name was taken, and he chose the name [[Tamla Records]]. The company began operating on January 21, 1959. "Come to Me" by Marv Johnson was issued as Tamla 101. [[United Artists Records]] picked up "Come to Me" for national distribution, as well as Johnson's more successful follow-up records such as "[[You Got What It Takes]]", co-produced by Gordy, who also received a co-writer credit, though the song was originally written and recorded by guitarist [[Bobby Parker (guitarist)|Bobby Parker]] for Vee Jay records a year and a half earlier. Gordy's next release was the only 45 ever issued on his Rayber label, featuring Wade Jones with an unnamed female backup group. The record did not sell well and is now one of the rarest issues from the Motown stable. Berry's third release was "[[Bad Girl (The Miracles song)|Bad Girl]]" by [[the Miracles]], the first release on the Motown record label. "Bad Girl" was a solid hit in 1959 after [[Chess Records]] picked it up. [[Barrett Strong]]'s "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]" initially appeared on Tamla and then charted on Gordy's sister's label, [[Anna Records]], in February 1960. It was The Miracles who gave the label its first million-selling hit single, with the 1960 ''[[Grammy Hall of Fame]]'' smash, "[[Shop Around]]" and this song, and its follow up hits,"[[You've Really Got a Hold on Me]]" (another ''Grammy Hall of Fame''-inducted hit), "[[Mickey's Monkey (song)|Mickey's Monkey]]","[[What's So Good About Goodbye]]", and "[[I'll Try Something New (song)|I'll Try Something New]]", made The Miracles the label's first stars.

The Tamla and Motown labels were then merged into a new company, [[Motown|Motown Record Corporation]], incorporated on April 14, 1960. In 1960, Gordy signed an unknown singer, [[Mary Wells]], who became the fledgling label's second star, with Smokey Robinson penning her hits "[[You Beat Me to the Punch]]", "[[Two Lovers (Mary Wells song)|Two Lovers]]", and "[[My Guy]]". The Miracles' hit "[[Shop Around]]" peaked at No. 1 on the national [[R&amp;B]] charts in late 1960 and at No. 2 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' pop charts on January 16, 1961 (No. 1 pop, [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]), which established Motown as an independent company worthy of notice. Later in 1961, [[the Marvelettes]]' "[[Please Mr. Postman]]" made it to the top of both charts.

Gordy's gift for identifying and bringing together musical talent, along with the careful management of his artists' public image, made Motown initially a major national and then international success. Over the next decade, he signed such artists as [[the Supremes]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[the Temptations]], [[Jimmy Ruffin]], [[the Contours]], the [[Four Tops]], [[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips]], [[the Commodores]], [[the Velvelettes]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[the Jackson 5]]. Though he also signed various white acts on the label (Rare Earth, Rustix, via the Rare Earth label), he largely promoted African-American artists but carefully controlled their public image, dress, manners and choreography for across-the-board appeal.

==Relocation to Los Angeles==
In 1972, Gordy relocated to Los Angeles, where he produced the commercially successful [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] on [[Billie Holiday]], ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', starring [[Diana Ross]] (who was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]), [[Richard Pryor]], and [[Billy Dee Williams]] (cast in a role originally for [[Levi Stubbs]] of the [[Four Tops]]). Initially the studio, over Gordy's objections, rejected Williams after several screen tests. However, Gordy, known for his tenacity, eventually prevailed, and the film established Williams as a major movie star. Berry Gordy soon after produced and directed ''[[Mahogany (1975 film)|Mahogany]],''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Richardson]] was the original director, but Gordy fired Richardson and took over direction himself after a dispute over minor casting.&lt;/ref&gt; also starring Ross and Williams. In 1985, he produced the cult martial arts film ''[[The Last Dragon]]'', which starred martial artist [[Taimak]] and one of [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] proteges, [[Vanity (performer)|Vanity]].

Although Motown continued to produce major hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s by artists including the Jacksons, [[Rick James]], Commodores, [[Lionel Richie]] and long-term signings, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson, the record company was no longer the major force it had been. Gordy sold his interests in Motown Records to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] and Boston Ventures on June 28, 1988, for $61 million. He later sold most of his interests in Jobete publishing to [[EMI]] Publishing. Gordy wrote or co-wrote 240 of the approximately 15,000 songs in Motown's Jobete music catalogue. However, the true test of the label's worth would come a few years later, when Polygram paid over $330 million ([[Diana Ross]] was given shares in this version of the label) for the Motown catalog.

Gordy published an autobiography, ''To Be Loved'', in 1994.

==Awards and accolades==
Gordy was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988.

Gordy was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1998.

In 2009, Berry Gordy was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/103-berry-gordy-jr&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordy received the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]'s Pioneer Award on June 13, 2013. He is the first living individual to receive the honor.&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam.

In 2016, Gordy received the [[National Medal of Arts]] from [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] for "helping to create a trailblazing new sound in American music. As a record producer and songwriter, he helped build Motown, launching the music careers of countless legendary artists. His unique sound helped shape our Nation's story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/22/495011305/at-white-house-a-golden-moment-for-americas-great-artists-and-patrons|title=At White House, A Golden Moment For America's Great Artists And Patrons|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements about Motown artists==
Following the funeral of [[Marvin Gaye]] on April 5, 1984, Gordy declared Gaye "the greatest of his time" and stated the singer "had no musical equals", comparing his talents to those of [[Billie Holiday]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=336-337}}

On March 20, 2009, Gordy was in Hollywood to pay tribute to his first group and first million-selling act, [[the Miracles]], when the members received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Speaking in tribute to the group, Gordy said: "Without the Miracles, Motown would not be the Motown it is today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daylife.com/photo/03Dy8rXgM6ctq?q=Pete+Moore |title=Photo from Reuters Pictures |publisher=Daylife.com |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318074101/http://www.daylife.com/photo/03Dy8rXgM6ctq?q=Pete+Moore |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/oyd__1s888I/Miracles+Honored+Hollywood+Walk+Fame/JrKAUKLXu0_ |title=The Miracles Honored At The Hollywood Walk Of Fame - Pictures |publisher=Zimbio |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/oyd__1s888I/Miracles+Honored+Hollywood+Walk+Fame/3UNMKXbcA5Z |title=The Miracles Honored At The Hollywood Walk Of Fame - Pictures |publisher=Zimbio |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/oyd__1s888I/Miracles+Honored+Hollywood+Walk+Fame/6cPIGmvSwSQ |title=The Miracles Honored At The Hollywood Walk Of Fame – Pictures |publisher=Zimbio |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 79, Gordy spoke at the [[Michael Jackson memorial service|memorial service for Michael Jackson]] in Los Angeles, on July 7, 2009. He suggested that "The King of Pop" was perhaps not the best description for Jackson in light of his achievements, referring to him instead as "the greatest entertainer that ever lived."

==''Motown: The Musical''==
On May 15, 2011, it was announced that Gordy was developing a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical about Motown. The show is said to be an account of events of the 1960s and how they shaped the creation of the label. Gordy hoped that the musical would improve the reputation of Motown Records and clear up any misconceptions regarding the label's demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://broadway.me/motown-founder-develops-own-story-for-broadway|title=Motown Founder Develops Own Story for Broadway|work=Broadway.me|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Motown: The Musical]]'' began previews at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]] on March 11, 2013, and began regular performances there on April 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/berry-gordy-smokey-robinson-motown-musical-397503 | title=Berry Gordy, Doug Morris, Smokey Robinson Preview 'Motown: The Musical' | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=December 4, 2012 | accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* Gordy was portrayed by [[Billy Dee Williams]] (whose career Gordy had helped to jump-start in the 1970s) in the 1992 miniseries ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]''.
* Gordy was portrayed by [[Obba Babatunde]] in the 1998 miniseries ''[[The Temptations (TV miniseries)|The Temptations]]''.
* The character Gordy Berry in ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' is a reference to Berry Gordy.
* The character of Curtis Taylor Jr., a music executive in the 2006 musical film ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', has been called "a thinly veiled portrayal" of Gordy.&lt;ref name="sorry"&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/they_re_berry_sorry_IyO4BBrykLSvrQo5kk6aHI THEY'RE BERRY SORRY], ''[[New York Post]]'', February 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The film was based on the 1981 musical ''[[Dreamgirls]]'', but the film made the connection to Gordy and Motown much more explicit than the musical did, by, among other things, moving the setting of the story from Chicago to Detroit. Taylor appears in the film as unethical and insensitive to his artists, which caused Gordy and others to criticize the film after its release. Gordy called the portrayal "100% wrong," while [[Smokey Robinson]] said it "blatantly painted a negative picture of Motown and Berry Gordy and of [[the Supremes]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_11_111/ai_n27176841/ Berry Gordy speaks out on 'Dreamgirls'], ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'', March 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the producers of the film, [[DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], issued a public apology to Gordy, saying they were sorry "for any confusion that has resulted from our fictional work." Gordy accepted the apology.&lt;ref name="sorry" /&gt;

==History==
===Squibb===
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by [[Edward Robinson Squibb]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], New York.  Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (''Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica'') after failing to convince the [[American Medical Association]] to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the ''Materia Medica'', Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inverse Type of Temperature in Typhoid Fever, with a Report of Two Cases — Temperature Peculiarities in Epidemics, with a Report of Seven Cases in One Family |journal=Boston Medical and Surgical Journal |date=January 8, 1885 |last=Hollopeter |first=W.C. |volume=112 |pages=28–32 |doi=10.1056/NEJM188308301090903 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM188710271171706 |accessdate=2014-11-25 |quote="The writer noticed (in December, 1882) the important fact that when common or Japan camphor and crystallized carbolic acid are mixed together and subjected to heat, a colorless liquid would be the result.

===Bristol-Myers===
In 1887, [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] graduates [[William McLaren Bristol]] and [[John Ripley Myers]] purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton]], New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it '''Bristol, Myers and Company'''. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the '''Bristol-Myers Corporation'''. The first nationally recognized product was [[Sal Hepatica]], a [[laxative]] mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was [[Ipana]] toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.&lt;ref name="MarketingChannels"&gt;Bert Rosenbloom, ''Marketing Channels'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=6WMJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA609 Bristol-Myers Squibb], 2011, page 609&lt;/ref&gt; Other divisions were Clairol (hair colors and haircare) and Drackett (household products such as Windex and Drano).

In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of [[acidophilus|acidophilus milk]] in [[East Syracuse, New York]], and converted the plant to produce [[penicillin]] for the [[Allies of World War II|World War II Allied forces]]. After the war, the company renamed the plant [[Bristol Laboratories]] in 1945 and entered the civilian [[antibiotics]] market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.&lt;ref name="MarketingChannels"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol-Myers Squibb|url=https://www.drugwatch.com/manufacturer/bristol-myers-squibb/|website=Drugwatch|accessdate=November 14, 2016|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other [[biopharmaceutical|biologic medicines]] for clinical trials and commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bms.com/sustainability/worldwide_facilities/north_america/Pages/syracuse_new_york.aspx Bristol-Meyers Squibb, ''Syracuse, New York'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merger===
Bristol-Myers and Squibb merged in 1989, with Bristol-Myers as the nominal survivor. The merged company became Bristol-Myers Squibb.

In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the [[National Medal of Technology]], the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."

===2000 to 2010===
In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/06/04/news/companies/bristol |title= Bristol hit with antitrust suit |date=June 4, 2002 |accessdate=Jul 10, 2013 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was involved in an [[accounting scandal]] in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "[[channel stuffing]]" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-68980061.html |title= Bristol-Myers to restate earnings as third quarter profits plunge}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-92165333.html |title= Bristol-Myers restates results upward due to accounting errors}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.

An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the [[FBI]] raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of [[collusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=565&amp;fArticleId=3367635 Business Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817193955/http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=565&amp;fArticleId=3367635 |date=17 August 2007 }}, July 31, 2006. Retrieved September 7, 2006. Archived at&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge [[Frederick B. Lacey]], urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/12/news/companies/bristol/index.htm?postversion=2006091217 CNN.com], September 12, 2006. Retrieved September 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company.

In 2009, a major restructuring began focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs.  This was part of a business strategy launched in 2007 to transform the company from a large diversified pharma company to a specialty biopharma company, which also included the closure of half of their manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.qgdigitalpublishing.com/publication/?i=531504&amp;p=&amp;pn=#{%22issue_id%22:531504,%22page%22:20}|title=From Big to Specialty&amp;mdash;The Operational Transformation of Bristol-Myers Squibb|last=Wright|first=Rob|date=October 2018|work=Life Science Leader|access-date=17 October 2018|publisher=VertMarkets|issue=10|location=Erie, Pennsylvania|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|19}}  As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In August, BMS acquired the [[biotechnology]] firm [[Medarex]] as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/BristolMyers-Squibb-to-bw-571310065.html?x=0&amp;.v=1&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals.

BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies.

In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas.  [[Lamberto Andreotti]] was named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] this year; he had previously served as "president and [[Chief operating officer|COO]] responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = BMS CEO Andreotti to Retire; COO named as Successor|last = Staff|date = 15 February 2015|work = [[Gen.

===2011 onward===
In 2011, Lou Schmukler joined the company as the president of global product development and design; Schmukler led the team that completed the company's strategic transformation to a specialty biopharmaceutical company that had begun in 2007.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|19}}  As of 2011, the company had a dozen manufacturing facilities and six product development sites.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|19}}

Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with [[Gilead]]/[[Pharmasset]] to produce [[Hepatitis C]] drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended on January 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LXGOIL0UQVI901-5RJORL8I6BNJBGJ76B844E0GQP |title=Bristol Buys Inhibitex for $2.5 Billion to Compete in Hepatitis |date=January 8, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb extended its portfolio of [[diabetes]] treatments when it agreed to buy [[Amylin Pharmaceuticals]] for around {{US$|5.3 billion}} in cash and pay {{US$|1.7 billion}} to [[Eli Lilly]] to cover Amylin's debt and its outstanding collaboration-related obligations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Astra Zeneca|AstraZeneca]], who already collaborated on several diabetes treatments with Bristol-Myers Squibb, agreed to pay {{US$|3.4 billion}} in cash for the right to continue development of Amylin's products.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/30/uk-amylin-bristolmyerssquibb-idUKBRE85T01U20120630|title=Bristol-Myers to buy Amylin for about USD 5.3 billion|last=Gershberg|first=Michele|date=30 June 2012|work=|access-date=|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, in 2014, the company divested Amylin to AstraZeneca.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|19}}

The '''celebrity-industrial complex''' is a social and economic construct which involves a symbiotic relationship between [[celebrity|celebrities]] and business corporations. First proposed by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' [[columnist]] [[Maureen Orth]] in her book, ''[[The Importance of Being Famous]]'' (2003), it is fueled both by the celebrities' seemingly continual search for fame and attention and the business corporations' search for catchy headlines and viable name brands that could be sustained by such celebrities.

In the celebrity-industrial complex, the celebrity either has a particular feature that is attractive to a public audience or is a victim of an occurrence that wins sympathy or condemnation from that same audience; this celebrity, for an initial period of time, becomes a subject of media scrutiny or marketing by properly funded media publication distributors. This media scrutiny, however, can often become a source of income for the celebrity, or the media scrutiny becomes an outlet of promotion for future manufactured publications or initiatives by the celebrities, and the media scrutiny around the celebrity expands to include coverage of such products.

The term "celebrity-industrial complex" is an homage to the much older term [[military–industrial complex]], which refers to a similar bilateral relationship between national militaries and industrial corporations which profit from each other.

'''Cellana, Inc.''' is a Hawaii- and San Diego-based developer of [[algae]]-based [[bioproducts]] for high-value [[nutrition]], [[ink]], and [[bioenergy]] applications, including [[Omega-3]] nutraceutical applications, sustainable [[ink]], [[aquaculture]] and [[animal feeds]], human [[food]] ingredients, [[pigments]], specialty [[chemicals]], and [[biofuels]].  Cellana has received (or has been a member of consortia that have received) multiple multimillion-dollar grants from the [[United States Department of Energy]] and [[United States Department of Agriculture]].  In 2018, Cellana and POS Bio-Sciences announced the signing of a letter of intent for the joint development and commercialization of high-value EPA Omega-3 oils from Cellana’s algae biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://cellana.com/press-releases/cellana-and-pos-bio-sciences-sign-letter-of-intent-for-the-joint-development-and-commercialization-of-high-value-algae-biomass-for-epa-omega-3s/&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016, the [[United States Department of Energy]] published a funding opportunity announcement in which Cellana's lead commercial algae strains KA32 and CO46, and the biomass yields demonstrated from these strains as part of the DOE-funded Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership (ATP3), were designated as DOE's "State of Technology" for the photosynthetic algae sector in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Available at Page 7 of the FOA, which can be found at https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/Default.aspx?Search=PEAK&amp;SearchType=#FoaId7e516e41-db54-4c51-a274-48604245e917/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, Cellana and Living Ink Technologies announced the signing of a letter of intent for the joint development and commercialization of inks containing Cellana’s renewable algae biomass.&lt;ref&gt;http://cellana.com/press-releases/cellana-and-living-ink-enter-into-a-joint-development-and-offtake-agreement-for-sustainable-algae-inks//&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Cellana and [[Neste Oil]], the world's largest refiner of [[renewable diesel]], announced the signing of a multi-year, commercial-scale off-take agreement for algae-based biocrude oil.&lt;ref&gt;http://cellana.com/press-releases/cellana-and-neste-oil-enter-into-multi-year-commercial-scale-off-take-agreement-for-algae-oil-feedstock-for-biofuels/&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellana, Inc. was founded in 2004 as HR BioPetroleum, Inc. and changed its name to Cellana, Inc. in May 2011. On January 31, 2011, Cellana LLC, a joint venture company formed by Royal Dutch Shell and HR BioPetroleum in 2007, became a wholly owned subsidiary of HR BioPetroleum, Inc./Cellana, Inc. Shell had previously announced on December 11, 2007 that it entered into a joint venture with HR BioPetroleum to, among other things, build and operate a demonstration facility in Hawaii for growing [[algae fuel|algae as a source of biofuels]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=54866&lt;/ref&gt;  This 2.5-hectare facility, known as the [[Kona Demonstration Facility]] (KDF), was completed and commissioned in 2009.

The original goal of the facility was to cultivate algae in [[photobioreactor]]s and [[raceway pond|open raceway ponds]] filled with seawater using a proprietary process, then harvest the algae and extract oil for conversion into fuels such as biodiesel and utilize the residual high protein algae meal for additional co-products.

KDF is located on a 2.5-hectare (6-acre) parcel of land leased from the [[Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority]] (NELHA), which is located on the west shore of the island of Hawaii.  NELHA pipes in a constant supply of fresh ocean water. NELHA was originally built to support a DOE project for ocean thermal energy conversion, and it continues to employ the project's seawater supply pipes to support a variety of research projects and commercial enterprises, including facilities that currently grow and harvest [[microalgae]] for pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements.

Cellana's facility grows only non-genetically modified, marine [[microalgae]] species using proprietary technology.

The '''Chiasso financial smuggling case''' began on June 3, 2009 near [[Chiasso, Switzerland]] (near the Swiss/Italian border), when Sezione Operativa Territoriale di Chiasso in collaboration with officers of Italian customs/financial military police ([[Guardia di Finanza]]) detained two suspects (who appeared to be [[Japanese people|Japanese nationals]] in their 50s)&lt;ref name=ftd.de&gt;{{cite web |title=Italien rätselt über 96-Mrd.-Euro-Schmuggel |url=http://www.ftd.de/politik/europa/:Kennedy-Bonds-Italien-r%E4tselt-%FCber-96-Mrd-Euro-Schmuggel/526520.html |date=June 13, 2009 |work=Financial Times Deutschland |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had attempted to enter Switzerland with a suitcase in their possession with a false bottom containing what at first appeared to be [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury Bonds]] worth $134.5 billion.&lt;ref name=gdf.it&gt;{{cite web|title=Sequestrati a Chinasso titoli USA per novantasei miliardi di euro |url=http://www.gdf.it/GdF__Informa/Notizie_Stampa/AdnKronos/Adnkronos_2009/Adnkronos_Giugno_2009/info-1518911049.html |date=July 6, 2009 |publisher=Guardia di Finanza |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613034419/http://www.gdf.it/gdf__informa/notizie_stampa/adnkronos/adnkronos_2009/adnkronos_giugno_2009/info-1518911049.html |archivedate=June 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AsiaNews&gt;{{cite web |title=US government securities seized from Japanese nationals, not clear whether real or fake |url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=15456&amp;size=A |date=June 8, 2009 |work= |publisher=AsiaNews.it |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jt"&gt;{{cite web |title=2 Japanese carrying $134 bil worth of U.S. bonds detained in Italy |url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/crime/view/2-japanese-carrying-134-bil-worth-of-us-bonds-detained-in-italy |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725152601/http://www.japantoday.com/category/crime/view/2-japanese-carrying-134-bil-worth-of-us-bonds-detained-in-italy |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 25, 2009 |date=June 11, 2009 |work=Japan Today |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two possessed 249 U.S. bonds worth $500 million each (among other securities, they also had 10 "Kennedy bonds" denominated at $1 billion each); and the large denominations of the securities, along with accompanying bank documentation was what attracted the Italian police's attention.&lt;ref name=gdf.it/&gt; Large denominations are not available to the general public; only [[nation-state]]s handle such amounts of money.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Investigation and determination==
Assessment as to the authenticity of the bonds began immediately ([[counterfeiting]] of these securities was suspected). One source reported that the [[Securities and Exchange Commission|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] had been requested to verify the authenticity of the bonds.&lt;ref name="jt"/&gt; A spokesman for the [[Bureau of Public Debt]] has commented on the matter.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

On June 18, 2009 the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that the Italian police and the [[U.S. Secret Service]] had concluded that "the bills and accompanying bank documents were most probably counterfeit, the latest handiwork of the [[Organized crime in Italy|Italian Mafia]]."&lt;ref name=ft.com&gt;{{cite news |title=Mafia blamed for $134bn fake Treasury bills |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/82091ec2-5c2f-11de-aea3-00144feabdc0.html |date=June 18, 2009 |work=Financial Times |access-date=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this information has not been verified by Italian official sources. Mckayla Braden, senior adviser for public affairs at the Bureau of Public Debt at the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] also said that this type of counterfeit bond scam "has been going on for years." Although these bonds, if fake, appear to have been of very high quality. Col. Rodolfo Mecarelli, the provincial commander of the financial police in Como, said that the bonds "are made of filigree paper of excellent quality."&lt;ref name=ftd.de/&gt;

The ''Financial Times'' also reported that the two suspects "had been released" by Italian authorities.  No additional comment or elaboration from the [[Guardia di Finanza]] (Italian financial/customs military police) headquarters in Rome was available. As well, Ed Donovan, a spokesman for the [[United States Secret Service]], has said that the “U.S. Secret Service, which polices counterfeiting of U.S. currency, is assisting Italian authorities in tracing the source of the fake bonds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UPDATE 1-U.S. Treasury says bonds seized in Italy are fakes |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN1946360420090619 |date=June 19, 2009 |work= |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |first=David |last=Lawder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Japanese authorities also remained interested in the matter; Takeshi Akamatsu, a press secretary for the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese foreign ministry]], confirmed that the two suspects were carrying Japanese passports and had been detained and questioned by the Guardia di Finanza, but that Tokyo had not been informed of their names or whereabouts during or after their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. says smuggled Treasury bonds were fake |url=http://www.gata.org/node/7514 |date=June 21, 2009 |work= |publisher=Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation or likelihood of passing counterfeit bonds of these types and size is not known.

==Reactions and speculation==
There has been very little in the way of official statements regarding this case, raising concerns about who made them,&lt;ref name=ft.com/&gt; dumping of U.S. debt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employees of Japan Finance Ministry arrested in Italy trying to smuggle $134 Billion in U.S. Treasuries in suitcases |url=http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59:employees-of-japan-finance-ministry-arrested-in-italy-trying-tosmuggle-134-billion-in-us-treasuries-in-suitcases&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=50 |date=June 19, 2009 |work= |publisher=Turner Radio Network |accessdate=February 21, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=$134.5 BILLION worth of US bonds seized from smugglers at Swiss border |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2009/06/14/1345-billion-worth-o.html |date=June 14, 2009 |work= |publisher=Boing Boing |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other questions include the identities of the Japanese men detained, the reason for their release, the origin of these high quality fake bonds, the U.S. Secret Service investigation, lack of Italian official acknowledgment of fakes and many other questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bond Saga: It Gets More Odd |url=http://market-ticker.org/archives/1142-The-Bond-Saga-It-Gets-More-Odd.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090624133353/http://market-ticker.org/archives/1142-The-Bond-Saga-It-Gets-More-Odd.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 24, 2009 |date=June 21, 2009 |work= |publisher=The Market Ticker |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reactions to the story contemplated the possibility that the bonds were genuine; if the bonds had proven to be genuine, this case would have been regarded as the largest single act of [[smuggling]] (with respect to financial value) in recorded history.&lt;ref name=AsiaNews/&gt; The total value of the counterfeit bonds was estimated at approximately one percent of total [[U.S. GDP]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Country Comparison: National Product |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html |date= |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair would also have been considered the fourth largest creditor to the U.S., ahead of the [[United Kingdom]] and just behind [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Is this the death of the dollar? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/5586543/Is-this-the-death-of-the-dollar.html |date=June 20, 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=July 6, 2009 | location=London | first=Edmund | last=Conway}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, according to Italian law failing to declare currency above 10,000 euros can be punished by fines of 40%.

Since the confirmation by American officials that the bonds were counterfeit, some reactions have shifted to taking note of a general loss of confidence in [[International finance|international banking and finance]] (in general) and the [[U.S. dollar]] in particular—as noted by a recent downward trend in the [[U.S. Dollar Index]] (and the dollar reaching a new low for 2009 vs. other world currencies on July 28, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown |first=Matthew |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aTaWdIwzI_mw |title=Dollar Touches 2009 Low as Economic View Reduces Safety Demand |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commentator Edmund Conway noted that when U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] traveled to [[China]] (in June 2009) and asserted in Beijing that Chinese financial assets denominated in the U.S. dollar "are very safe," it drew laughter from the audience, even though laughter was not Geitner's intent.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; 

Conway also speculated that this incident may be a sign that "America is on the brink of losing its economic superpower status."&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

==Similar Incidents==
On September 18, 2009, a similar incident was reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/09_settembre_20/bond_falsi_delfrate_661f9a3e-a5c6-11de-a2a4-00144f02aabc.shtml |title=Il mistero dei bond falsi Miliardi verso la Svizzera - Corriere della Sera |publisher=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by the Italian financial military police [[Guardia di Finanza]], this time involving two (apparently) [[Philippines|Philippine nationals]] smuggling U.S. Treasury bonds (valued at approximately $180 billion) at [[Malpensa Airport]] (the largest airport in [[Milan, Italy]]).  The two were detained and the assessment of this case is on-going.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rassegnastampa.mef.gov.it/mefeconomica/View.aspx?ID=2009091813722922-2 |title=Libero Quotidiano - Filippini con 180 miliardi nel trolley.

The six are under investigation for receiving stolen goods.

On February 17, 2012, it was reported, Italian police seized $6 trillion in counterfeit U.S. bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financial-crime/9089268/Italian-police-seize-6-trillion-of-fake-US-bonds-in-Switzerland.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Richard | last=Blackden | title=Italian police seize $6 trillion of fake US bonds in Switzerland | date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chief product officer''' ('''CPO'''), sometimes known as '''chief innovation officer''', is a corporate title referring to an [[Corporate executive|executive]] responsible for various product-related activities in an organization, especially a corporation. Most often the position reports to the [[chief executive officer]].

==Role==

A CPO is responsible for all product-related matters. Usually includes product innovation, conception and development, production in general, project management and product management. In many IT/telecommunications companies, this position includes release management and production. They typically work on the product strategy based upon the goals set by the CEO or board members.

==Responsibilities==

A chief product officer may sometimes serve as a chief marketing officer by involving themselves in marketing and advertising product benefits to the consumers. The CPO can both design or modify the product, so that it reaches the customer's satisfaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">The '''clear craze''' was a marketing fad in the late 1980s and 1990s. In beverages, clarity was equated with purity and freedom from artificial dyes and manufacturers of household items released clear versions of their products.

==Drinks==
Following the trend of "light" drinks with fewer calories and artificial flavors, many companies released "clear" versions of their products. [[Crystal Pepsi]] was promoted as having no preservatives and no caffeine, although the previous Pepsi also did not have preservatives, and a caffeine-free version was already available. Soon after, [[Coca-Cola]] released [[Tab Clear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/283798159/|title=15 Feb 1993, 35 - The Morning Call at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beer industry also became involved. In Aug 1992, [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] announced [[Zima (drink)|Zima]], a clear, carbonated malt beer and in 1993, [[Miller]] released [[Miller Clear]], a clear variant of their beer to mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/289539607|title=27 Jun 1993, 5 - The News Leader at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal hygiene==
[[Gillette]] released versions of their deodorants and shaving creams in a clear gel form which is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/283798411|title=15 Feb 1993, 42 - The Morning Call at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of [[Plexiglas]] in the late 1930s, devices have been made with clear shells to expose the electromechanical components inside. At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], a [[Pontiac straight-6 engine|139 Pontiac Deluxe Six]] engine with a clear Plexiglas body was on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/5826306/see-through-1939-pontiac-sells-for-308000|title=See-through 1939 Pontiac sells for $308,000|first=Tom|last=Joslin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/06/ghost-car-pontiac-auction_n_891319.html|title=Ghost Car -- A 1939 Plexiglas Pontiac Deluxe Six -- To Be Auctioned|date=6 July 2011|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peaking in the 1960s and 1970s, transparent-shelled devices fell out of fashion until the clear craze in the late 80s. Following the [[breakup of the Bell System]] in the mid 80s, a surge of manufactures began creating phones, many of them transparent and having flashing neon lights when the phone rang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/280969072|title=26 Apr 1990, 13 - The Daily Journal at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up into the 90s, the trend continued with transparent watches, staplers, calculators and handheld gaming devices including the [[Nintendo Game Boy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/123648156|title=8 Oct 1996, Page 30 - Arizona Republic at Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Council for Industry and Higher Education''', known as '''CIHE''', was a [[non-governmental organisation]] founded in 1986 in the [[United Kingdom]], and from 1997, was a [[company limited by guarantee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[Companies House]] |url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/792851b374564bf0f94c018dcb05e7c4//compdetails |title=Companies House record for CIHE |accessdate=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[charitable trust|registered charity]].&lt;ref name="charity"&gt;{{cite web |website=[[Charity Commission]] |url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?regno=1066956 |title=Extract from the Central Register of Charities |accessdate=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CIHE aimed to be "a strategic leadership network of [[business]]es and [[higher education]] executives promoting a system of higher learning that led to greater market competitiveness and social well-being".&lt;ref name=cihe-about&gt;{{cite web |website=[[CIHE]] |url=http://www.cihe.co.uk/about/ |title=About Us |accessdate=1 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123150857/http://www.cihe.co.uk/about/ |archivedate=23 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CIHE was a strategic leadership network of blue-chip companies working with vice chancellors and universities to develop the UK’s knowledge-based economy. It was born from the inspired collaboration of [[James Prior, Baron Prior|James Prior]], John Cassels and [[Pauline Perry, Baroness Perry of Southwark|Pauline Perry]]. Perry (at that time the Chief Inspector of Schools at the Department for Education) had heard about an American organisation that had managed to bring businesses and universities closer together. Cassels (as Director General of the National Economic Development Office) was a staunch believer in the power of partnership while Prior was a recent Cabinet member and the new chairman of GEC. He agreed to invite the heads of a range of businesses, universities and polytechnics to a couple of initial discussions to see if there was indeed a common cause that might be addressed through a partnership approach.

In 2013, in response to the Wilson Review CIHE was replaced by the [[National Centre for Universities and Business]] (NCUB).

==Funding==
The Council was funded by its member organisations and by external organisations. The funding sources included [[university|universities]], other organisations and companies.&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=CIHE |url=http://www.cihe.co.uk/about/council-members/ |title=Members |accessdate=13 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116173423/http://www.cihe.co.uk/about/council-members/ |archivedate=16 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=CIHE |url=http://www.cihe.co.uk/about/funders/ |title=Funding Organisations |accessdate=1 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123220219/http://www.cihe.co.uk/about/funders/ |archivedate=23 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each member organisation appointed one person to the Council, and seven of those people were [[#Trustees|Trustees]].

'''Culture jamming''' (sometimes [[guerrilla communication]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w0TSfW4MU4QC&amp;pg=PA274 ''Images of the street: planning, identity, and control in public space''] By Nicholas R. Fyfe, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Grindon [https://books.google.com/books?id=U4fpAAAAMAAJ ''Aesthetics and Radical Politics'']&lt;/ref&gt; is a tactic used by many [[anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] [[social movement]]s&lt;ref name="Binay"&gt;"Investigating the Anti-consumerism Movement in North America: The Case of Adbusters';" Binay, Ayse; (2005); dissertation, University of Texas&lt;/ref&gt; to disrupt or subvert [[media culture]] and its [[mainstream]] cultural institutions, including corporate advertising.  It attempts to "expose the methods of domination" of a [[mass society]] to foster [[Progressivism|progressive]] change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4auF2ysN0wC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5 p. 5 ''Culture Jamming: Ideological Struggle and the Possibilities for Social Change'' ]; 2008; Nomai, Afsheen Joseph&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture jamming is a form of [[subvertising]].&lt;ref name="Cortese2008"&gt;{{cite book | author=Anthony Joseph Paul Cortese| title=Provocateur: Images of Women and Minorities in Advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6pO6kUa9w0C&amp;pg=PA22| accessdate=3 December 2012|year=2008| publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield| isbn=978-0-7425-5539-6| page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many ''culture jams'' are intended to expose questionable political assumptions behind commercial culture. Culture jamming makes use of the technique ''[[détournement]]'', which uses the language and rhetoric of the mainstream paradigm or culture to subversively critique the paradigm or culture. Tactics include re-figuring logos, fashion statements, and product images as a means to challenge the idea of "what's cool".&lt;ref name="Boden"&gt;Boden, Sharon and Williams, Simon J. (2002) "Consumption and Emotion: The Romantic Ethic Revisited", Sociology 36(3):493–512&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture jamming often entails using [[mass media]] to produce ironic or [[satirical]] commentary about itself, commonly using the original medium's communication method.

Culture jamming is employed as a reaction against social [[conformity]].  Prominent examples of culture jamming include the adulteration of billboard advertising by the [[Billboard Liberation Front]] (BLF), and [[List of contemporary artists#E|contemporary artists]] such as [[Ron English (artist)|Ron English]].  Culture jamming may involve street parties and protests.  While culture jamming usually focuses on subverting or critiquing political and advertising messages, some proponents focus on a more positive (often musically inspired) form which brings together artists, scholars, and activists to create new types of cultural production that transcend – rather than merely criticize – the status quo.&lt;ref name="LeVine"&gt;LeVine, Mark (2005)'' Why They Don't Hate Us: Lifting the Veil on the Axis of Evil''. Oxford, UK: Oneworld Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Culture Jam Pedagogy and Practice: Relocating Culture by Staying on One's Toes|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cccr.12090/abstract|journal = Communication, Culture &amp; Critique|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 1753-9137|pages = 395–413|volume = 8|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/cccr.12090|first = Tema|last = Milstein|first2 = Alexis|last2 = Pulos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term, etymology, and history==

===1984 coinage===
The term was coined in 1984 by [[Don Joyce (musician)|Don Joyce]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.negativland.com/news/?p=696 |title=Don Joyce (2/9/44 – 7/22/15) |publisher=Negativland}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[sound collage]] band [[Negativland]], with the release of their album ''[[JamCon '84]]''.&lt;ref name="Lloyd03"&gt;Lloyd, Jan (2003) [http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/cult/research/lloyd.htm ''Culture Jamming: Semiotic Banditry in the Streets''], in ''Cultural Studies Department'': University of Canterbury,
Christchurc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dery90Nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dery2010Revisited"&gt;Dery, Mark (2010) New Introduction and revisited edition of [http://markdery.com/?page_id=154 ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs]'', October 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "culture jamming" comes from the idea of [[radio jamming]]:&lt;ref name="Dery90Nyt"/&gt; that public frequencies can be pirated and subverted for independent communication, or to disrupt dominant frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://disruptdominantfrequencies.net/ Disrupt Dominant Frequencies]&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the tracks of the album, they stated:&lt;ref name="Dery90Nyt"/&gt;

{{quotation|As awareness of how the media environment we occupy affects and directs our inner life grows, some resist. The skillfully reworked billboard... directs the public viewer to a consideration of the original corporate strategy. The studio for the cultural jammer is the world at large.}}

===Origins and preceding influences===
According to [[Vince Carducci]], although the term was coined by Negativland, culture jamming can be traced as far back as the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Carducci"&gt;[[Vince Carducci|Carducci, Vince]] (2006) "Culture Jamming: A Sociological Perspective", Journal of Consumer Culture 6(1): 116–138&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly influential group that was active in Europe was the [[Situationist International]] and was led by [[Guy Debord]]. The SI asserted that in the past humans dealt with life and the consumer market directly. They argued that this spontaneous way of life was slowly deteriorating as a direct result of the new "modern" way of life. Situationists saw everything from television to radio as a threat &lt;ref name ="Lasn"&gt;Lasn, Kalle (1999) Culture Jam: How to Reverse America's Suicidal Consumer Binge – And Why We Must. New York: HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that life in industrialized areas, driven by capitalist forces, had become monotonous, sterile, gloomy, linear, and productivity driven. In particular, the SI argued humans had become passive recipients of ''the'' ''[[The Society of the Spectacle|spectacle]]'',  a simulated reality that generates the desire to consume, and positions humans as obedient consumerist cogs within the efficient and exploitative productivity loop of capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Society of the spectacle|last = Debord|first = Guy|publisher = Black and Red|year = 1983|isbn = |location = Detroit|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through playful activity, individuals could create ''[[Situationist prank|situations]]'', the opposite of spectacles.  For the SI, these situations took the form of the ''[[dérive]]'', or the active drift of the body through space in ways that broke routine and overcame boundaries, creating situations by exiting habit and entering new interactive possibilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The cultural critic [[Mark Dery]] traces the origins of culture jamming to medieval carnival, which [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] interpreted, in ''Rabelais and his World,'' as an officially sanctioned subversion of the social hierarchy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Modern precursors might include: the media-savvy agit-prop of the anti-Nazi photomonteur [[John Heartfield]], the sociopolitical street theater and staged media events of 1960s radicals such as [[Abbie Hoffman]], the [[Germany|German]] concept of [[Spaßguerilla]], and in the [[Situationist International]] (SI) of the 1950s and 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The SI first compared its own activities to [[radio jamming]] in 1968, when it proposed the use of [[guerrilla communication]] within [[mass media]] to sow confusion within the dominant culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 1985, the [[Guerrilla Girls]] formed to expose discrimination and corruption in the [[art world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://markdery.com:?page_id=154 Mark Dery."A Brief Introduction to the 2010 Reprint (open source)." ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of Signs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Dery's ''[[New York Times]]'' article on culture jamming, "The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax"&lt;ref name="Dery90Nyt"&gt;[[Mark Dery|Dery, Mark]] (1990)[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DF123EF930A15751C1A966958260&amp;pagewanted=all ''The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax''], NYtimes article, December 23, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first mention, in the mainstream media, of the phenomenon; Dery later expanded on this article in his 1993 Open Magazine pamphlet, ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs'',&lt;ref name="Dery93OpenMag"&gt;Dery, Mark (1993) [http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/culture_jamming.html ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs]'', in ''Open Magazine Pamphlet Series'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt; a seminal essay that remains the most exhaustive historical, sociopolitical, and philosophical theorization of culture jamming to date. ''[[Adbusters]]'', a Canadian publication espousing an environmentalist critique of consumerism and advertising, began promoting aspects of culture jamming after Dery introduced founder and editor [[Kalle Lasn]] to the term through a series of articles he wrote for the magazine. In her critique of consumerism, ''[[No Logo]]'', the Canadian cultural commentator and political activist [[Naomi Klein]] examines culture jamming in a chapter which focuses on the work of [[Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada]]. Through an analysis of the [[Where the Hell is Matt?|Where the Hell is Matt]] viral videos, researchers Milstein and Pulos analyze how the power of the culture jam to disrupt the status quo is currently being threatened by increasing commercial incorporation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, T-Mobile utilized the Liverpool street underground station to host a flashmob to sell their mobile services.

==Tactics==
[[File:Vorsprung durch Graffit cropped.jpg|thumb|240px|Graffitied text on billboard in [[Cambridge]], [[UK]]]][[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating culture jamming through musical icons]]
Culture jamming is a form of disruption that plays on the [[emotions]] of viewers and bystanders. Jammers want to disrupt the unconscious thought process that takes place when most consumers view a popular advertising and bring about a [[détournement]].&lt;ref name="Lasn"/&gt; Activists that utilize this tactic are counting on their [[meme]] to pull on the emotional strings of people and evoke some type of reaction. The reactions that most cultural jammers are hoping to evoke are behavioral change and political action. There are four [[emotion]]s that activists often want viewers to feel. These emotions – [[shock value|shock]], [[shame]], [[fear]], and [[anger]] – are believed to be the catalysts for social change.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;Summers-Effler, Erika (2002) "The Micro Potential for Social Change: Emotion, Consciousness, and Social Movement Formation", Sociological Theory 20(1): 41–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic unit in which a message is transmitted in culture jamming is the [[meme]]. Memes are condensed images that stimulate visual, verbal, musical, or behavioral associations that people can easily imitate and transmit to others. The term meme was coined and first popularized by geneticist [[Richard Dawkins]], but later used by cultural critics such as [[Douglas Rushkoff]], who claimed memes were a type of [[media virus]].&lt;ref name="Rushkoff"&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas (1996) Media Virus! New York: Ballantine&lt;/ref&gt; Memes are seen as [[genes]] that can jump from outlet to outlet and replicate themselves or mutate upon transmission just like a virus.&lt;ref name="Dawkins"&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1989) The Selfish Gene. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Culture jammers will often use common symbols such as the McDonald's golden arches or Nike swoosh to engage people and force them to think about their eating habits or fashion sense.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/ccce/polcommcampaigns/CultureJamming.htm Center for Communication and Civic Engagement], [[Seattle, Washington]] Retrieved November 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In one example, jammer [[Jonah Peretti]] used the Nike symbol to stir debate on sweatshop child labor and consumer freedom. Peretti made public exchanges between himself and Nike over a disagreement. Peretti had requested custom Nikes with the word "sweatshop" placed in the Nike symbol. Nike refused. Once this story was made public over Peretti's website, it spread worldwide and contributed to the already robust conversation&lt;ref name="businessinsider"&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/how-nike-solved-its-sweatshop-problem-2013-5?op=1], [[Business Insider]] Retrieved February 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and dialogue about Nike's use of sweatshops,&lt;ref name="website"/&gt; which had been ongoing for a decade prior to Peretti's 2001 stunt. Jammers can also organize and participate in mass campaigns. Examples of cultural jamming like Perretti's are more along the lines of tactics that radical consumer social movements would use. These movements push people to question the taken-for-granted assumption that consuming is natural and good and aim to disrupt the naturalization of consumer culture; they also seek to create systems of production and consumption that are more humane and less dominated by global corporate [[Late capitalism|hypercapitalism]].&lt;ref name = "Princen"&gt;Princen, Thomas, Maniates, Michael and Conca, Ken (2002) Confronting Consumption. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Past mass events and ideas have included "Buy Nothing Day", "Digital Detox Week", virtual sit-ins and protests over the Internet, producing ‘subvertisements' and placing them in public spaces, and creating and enacting ‘placejamming' projects
where public spaces are reclaimed and nature is re-introduced into urban
places.&lt;ref name= "harold"&gt;Harold, Christine (2004) `Pranking Rhetoric: "Culture jamming" as Media Activism', Critical Studies in Media Communication 21(3): 189–211&lt;/ref&gt;

The most effective form of jamming is to use an already widely recognizable meme to transmit the message. Once viewers are forced to take a second look at the mimicked popular meme they are forced out of their comfort zone. Viewers are presented with another way to view the meme and forced to think about the implications presented by the jammer.&lt;ref name="Lasn"/&gt; More often than not, when this is used as a tactic the jammer is going for shock value. For example, to make consumers aware of the negative body image that big-name fashion brands are frequently accused of causing, a subvertisement of Calvin Klein's 'Obsession' was created and played worldwide. It depicted a young woman with an eating disorder throwing up into a toilet.&lt;ref name="Bordwell"&gt;Bordwell, Marilyn (2002) `Jamming Culture: Adbusters' Hip Media Campaign against Consumerism', in Thomas Princen, Michael Maniates and Ken Conca (eds) Confronting Consumption, pp. 237–53. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that social consumer movements hope to utilize culture jamming effectively is by employing a metameme. A metameme is a two-level message that punctures a specific commercial image, but does so in a way that challenges some larger aspect of the political culture of corporate domination.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt; An example would be the "true cost" campaign set in motion by Adbusters. "True Cost" forced consumers to compare the human labor cost and conditions and environmental drawbacks of products to the sales costs. Another example would be the "Truth" campaigns that frequented television in the past years that exposed the deception tobacco companies used to sell their products.

Following critical scholars like [[Paulo Freire]], Culture jams are also being Integrated into the university classroom "setting in which students and teachers gain the opportunity not only to learn methods of informed public critique, but also to collaboratively use participatory communication techniques to actively create new locations of meaning."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, students disrupt public space to bring attention to community concerns or utilize subvertisments to engage with [[media literacy]] projects.

==Criticism==
Culture jamming is sometimes confused with [[Appropriation (art)|artistic appropriation]] or with acts of [[vandalism]] which have destruction or defacement as their primary goal.  Although the end result is not always easily distinguishable from these activities, the intent of those participating in culture jamming differs from that of people whose intent is either artistic or merely destructive.  The lines are not always clear-cut; some activities, notably [[street art]], will fall into two or even all three categories.

Recently there have been arguments against the validity and effectiveness of culture jamming. Some argue that culture jamming is easily co-opted and commodified by the market, which tends to "defuse" its potential for consumer resistance.&lt;ref name="Rumbo"&gt;Rumbo, Joseph D. (2002) "Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters", Psychology &amp; Marketing 19(2): 127–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Others posit that the culture jamming strategy of rhetorical sabotage, used by Adbusters, is easily incorporated and appropriated by clever advertising agencies, and thus is not a very powerful means of social change.&lt;ref name="harold"/&gt; Yet other critics argue that without moving beyond mere critique to offering an alternative economic, social, cultural and/or political vision, jams quickly lose their power and resonance.&lt;ref name="LeVine" /&gt;

==Early life and business activities==
In 1989, Tashi moved to the Tibet Autonomous Region from [[Xiahe County]], [[Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]], [[Gansu]]. He first took up employment in a restaurant as a dishwasher. In his spare time, he studied English and tourism, eventually becoming licensed by [[Shigatse]]'s International Tourism Agency (国际旅行社) as a tour guide and interpreter. He earned swift promotion, becoming a department manager. He joined the [[Communist Party of China]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="ZhongguoMinzubao"/&gt; He would go on to serve as a delegate to the National Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/12/tibet-businessman-dorje-tashi-jailed|periodical=The Guardian|date=2010-08-12|accessdate=2010-10-26|title=Tibetan businessman jailed for life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tashi established a [[joint venture]] with a [[Netherlands]]-based company, with [[Renminbi|¥]]500 of capital; this would later become the Shenhu Group, which by 2008 had grown to a well-capitalised business with ¥280 million in assets and eight fully owned subsidiaries. By his own account, he was inspired to begin charitable activities one day in April 2006 while visiting the Chabalang Hope Primary School (茶巴朗希望小学) in [[Qüxü County]], where he saw students whose only source of drinking water was a nearby ditch; under his direction, the Shenhu Group donated ¥4.3 million to assist unemployed workers and students.&lt;ref name="ZhongguoMinzubao"/&gt;

==Criminal conviction==
In early 2008, after the [[2008 Lhasa violence]], Tashi was arrested; according to the [[India]]-based [[Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy]], he was accused of funding overseas Tibetan groups, including the office of the [[Dalai Lama]], and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Supporters claim the charges were fabricated; [[Robbie Barnett]], director of the Modern Tibetan Studies programme at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], claimed that Tibetan exile groups did not attempt to raise money in China.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; His conviction followed close on the heels of the June 2010 antiquities looting case against a prominent Tibetan art dealer, [[Karma Samdrup]], based on charges that had previously been dropped in 1998, and also occurred concurrently with the trial of another Tibetan writer, [[Tragyal]] (pen name Shogdung), a [[Qinghai]]-based writer who was moved by the March 2008 protests to write a book questioning China's policy in Tibet. In an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Barnett stated that this wave of trials showed that Chinese officials were becoming suspicious of Tibetans they formerly believed to be pro-state, and that China's policy of encouraging economic development in Tibet had failed to ensure the loyalty of Tibetan businesspeople.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

'''Elbridge Gerry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɛr|i}}; July 17, 1744 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] July 6, 1744) – November 23, 1814) was an American [[Politician|statesman]] and [[diplomat]]. As a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] he served as the fifth [[Vice President of the United States]] under President [[James Madison]] from March 1813 until his death in November 1814.  He is known best for being the namesake of [[gerrymandering]].

Born into a wealthy merchant family, Gerry vocally opposed British colonial policy in the 1760s, and was active in the early stages of organizing the resistance in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Elected to the [[Second Continental Congress]], Gerry signed both the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Articles of Confederation]].  He was one of three men who attended the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 who refused to sign the [[United States Constitution]] because it did not then include a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].  After its ratification he was elected to the inaugural [[United States Congress]], where he was actively involved in drafting and passage of the Bill of Rights as an advocate of individual and state liberties.

Gerry was at first opposed to the idea of [[political parties]], and cultivated enduring friendships on both sides of the political divide between [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and Democratic-Republicans.  He was a member of a diplomatic delegation to [[France]] that was treated poorly in the [[XYZ Affair]], in which Federalists held him responsible for a breakdown in negotiations.  Gerry thereafter became a Democratic-Republican, running unsuccessfully for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] several times before winning the office in 1810.  During his second term, the legislature approved new state senate districts that led to the coining of the word "gerrymander"; he lost the next election, although the state senate remained Democratic-Republican.  Chosen by Madison as his vice presidential candidate in 1812, Gerry was elected, but died a year and a half into his term.  He is the only signer of the Declaration of Independence who is buried in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Early life==
Elbridge Gerry was born on July 17, 1744, in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]].  His father, Thomas Gerry, was a merchant operating ships out of Marblehead, and his mother, Elizabeth (Greenleaf) Gerry, was the daughter of a successful Boston merchant.&lt;ref name=Purcell46&gt;Purcell, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerry's first name came from John Elbridge, one of his mother's ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerry's parents had eleven children in all, although only five survived to adulthood.  Of these, Elbridge was the third.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  He was first educated by private tutors, and entered [[Harvard College]] shortly before turning fourteen.  After receiving a B.A. in 1762 and an M.A. in 1765, he entered his father's merchant business.  By the 1770s the Gerrys numbered among the wealthiest Massachusetts merchants, with trading connections in [[Spain]], the [[West Indies]], and along the North American coast.&lt;ref name=Purcell46/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerry's father, who had emigrated from England in 1730, was active in local politics and had a leading role in the local militia.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Gerry was from an early time a vocal opponent of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentary]] efforts to tax the colonies after the [[French and Indian War]] ended in 1763.  In 1770 he sat on a Marblehead committee that sought to enforce importation bans on taxed British goods.  He frequently communicated with other Massachusetts opponents of British policy, including [[Samuel Adams]], [[John Adams]], [[Mercy Otis Warren]], and others.&lt;ref name=Purcell46/&gt;

In May 1772 he won election to the Great and General Court of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] (its legislative assembly).  There he worked closely with Samuel Adams to advance colonial opposition to Parliamentary colonial policies.  He was responsible for establishing Marblehead's [[committee of correspondence]], one of the first to be set up after that of [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Austin, pp. 6–27&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an incident of mob action prompted him to resign from the committee the next year.  Gerry and other prominent Marbleheaders had [[Essex Hospital|established a hospital]] for performing [[smallpox]] inoculations on [[Cat Island (Massachusetts)|Cat Island]]; because the means of transmission of the disease were not known at the time, fears amongst the local population led to protests which escalated into violence that wrecked the facilities and threatened the proprietors' other properties.&lt;ref&gt;Gilje, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry reentered politics after the [[Boston Port Act]] closed that city's port in 1774, and Marblehead became a port to which relief supplies from other colonies could be delivered.  As one of the town's leading merchants and Patriots, Gerry played a major role in ensuring the storage and delivery of supplies from Marblehead to Boston, interrupting those activities only to care for his dying father.  He was elected as a representative to the [[First Continental Congress]] in September 1774, but refused, still grieving the loss of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congress and Revolution==
Gerry was elected to the provincial assembly, which reconstituted itself as the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]] after Governor [[Thomas Gage]] dissolved the body in October 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  He was assigned to its committee of safety, responsible for assuring that the province's limited supplies of weapons and gunpowder remained out of [[British Army]] hands.  His actions were partly responsible for the storage of weapons and ammunition in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]; these stores were the target of the British raiding expedition that sparked the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  (Gerry was staying at an inn at Menotomy, now [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]], when the British marched through on the night of April 18.)&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Siege of Boston]] that followed, Gerry continued to take a leading role in supplying the nascent [[Continental Army]], something he would continue to do as the war progressed.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;  He leveraged business contacts in [[France]] and Spain to acquire not just munitions, but supplies of all types, and was involved in the transfer of financial subsidies from Spain to Congress.  He sent ships to ports all along the American coast, and dabbled in financing [[privateering]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 124–30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Trumbull - John Adams - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Adams]] (portrait by [[John Trumbull]]) held Gerry in high regard.]]
Unlike some merchants, there is no evidence that Gerry profiteered from this activity (he spoke out against it, and in favor of price controls), although his war-related merchant activities notably increased the family's wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 56, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  His gains were tempered to some extent by the precipitous decline in the value of paper currencies, which he held in large quantities and speculated in.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 134–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry served in the [[Second Continental Congress]] from February 1776 to 1780, when matters of the ongoing war occupied the body's attention.  He was influential in convincing a number of delegates to support passage of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in the debates held during the summer of 1776; John Adams wrote of him, "If every Man here was a Gerry, the Liberties of America would be safe against the Gates of Earth and Hell."&lt;ref name=SenateBio/&gt;  He was implicated as a member of the so-called "[[Conway Cabal]]", a group of Congressmen and military officers who were dissatisfied with the performance of General [[George Washington]] during the [[Philadelphia campaign|1777 military campaign]].  However, Gerry took Pennsylvania leader [[Thomas Mifflin]], one of Washington's critics, to task early in the episode, and specifically denied knowledge of any sort of conspiracy against Washington in February 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry's political philosophy was one of limited central government, and he regularly advocated for the maintenance of civilian control of the military. He held these positions fairly consistently throughout his political career (wavering principally on the need for stronger central government in the wake of the 1786–87 [[Shays's Rebellion]]) and was well known for his personal integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 140, 152, 192&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years he was against the idea of political parties, remaining somewhat distant from the developing [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] and [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] parties until later in his career.  It was not until 1800 that he would formally associate with the Democratic-Republicans in opposition to what he saw as attempts by the Federalists to centralize too much power in the national government.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1780 he resigned from the Continental Congress over the issue, and refused offers from the state legislature to return to the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  He also refused appointment to the state senate, claiming he would be more effective in the state's lower chamber, and also refused appointment as a county judge, comparing the offer by Governor [[John Hancock]] to those made by royally appointed governors to benefit their political allies.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1781.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter G|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterG.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116114129/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/Chapterg.pdf|archive-date=2014-01-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry was convinced to rejoin the [[Confederation Congress]] in 1783, when the state legislature agreed to support his call for needed reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  He served in that body until September 1785, during which time it met in [[New York City]].  The following year he married Ann Thompson, the daughter of a wealthy New York merchant who was twenty years his junior; his best man was his good friend [[James Monroe]].&lt;ref name=SenateBio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ammon, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had ten children between 1787 and 1801, straining Ann's health.&lt;ref name=SenateBio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/elbridge_gerry.pdf|title=Vice Presidents of the United States: Elbridge Gerry (1813–1814)|last=Hatfield|first=Mark|publisher=Senate Historical Office|accessdate=2012-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019145506/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/elbridge_gerry.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war made Gerry sufficiently wealthy that when it ended he sold off his merchant interests, and began investing in land.  In 1787 he purchased the [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] estate of the last royal lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, [[Thomas Oliver (Lieutenant Governor)|Thomas Oliver]], which had been confiscated by the state.  This {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} property, known as [[Elmwood (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Elmwood]], became the family home for the rest of Gerry's life.&lt;ref name=Elmwood_NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000364}}|title=National Register Nomination for Elmwood|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to own property in Marblehead, and bought a number of properties in other Massachusetts communities.  He also owned shares in the [[Ohio Company of Associates|Ohio Company]], prompting some political opponents to characterize him as an owner of vast tracts of western lands.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional Convention==
Gerry played a major role in the [[U.S. Constitutional Convention]], held in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;  In its deliberations he consistently advocated for a strong delineation between state and federal government powers, with state legislatures shaping the membership of federal government positions.  Gerry's opposition to popular election of representatives was rooted in part by the events of [[Shays' Rebellion]], a populist uprising in western Massachusetts in the year preceding the convention.  Despite this position, he also sought to maintain individual liberties by providing checks on government power that might abuse or limit those freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt;  He supported the idea that the [[United States Senate|Senate]] composition should not be determined by population; the view that it should instead be composed of equal numbers of members for each state prevailed in the [[Connecticut Compromise]].  The compromise was adopted on a narrow vote in which the Massachusetts delegation was divided, Gerry and [[Caleb Strong]] voting in favor.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerry further proposed that senators of a state, rather than casting a single vote on behalf of the state, instead vote as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerry was also vocal in opposing the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], which counted [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] as 3/5 of a person for the purposes of apportionment in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and gave southern states a decided advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=30%
|quote=Gerry's preference for a more highly centralized government throughout most of the Convention was not motivated by a desire for great social changes, but was intended rather to restrain such popular excesses as were evidenced in Shays's Rebellion. ... [H]e defended popular rights when the people appeared to be threatened by some powerful interest groups, and he called for restraints on popular influence when the people seemed to be gaining the upper hand too much.
|source=—[[George Athan Billias]]&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Advocating indirect elections===
Because of his fear of [[demagoguery]] and belief the people of the United States could be easily misled, Gerry also advocated [[indirect election]]s. Although he was unsuccessful in obtaining them for the lower house of Congress, Gerry did obtain such indirect elections for the U.S. Senate, whose members were to be elected by the state legislatures. Gerry also advanced numerous proposals for indirect elections of the President of the United States, most of them involving limiting the right to vote to the state governors and electors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/spring/gerry.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719195339/https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/spring/gerry.html |date=2017-07-19 }} "A Founding Father in Dissent Elbridge Gerry Helped Inspire Bill of Rights in His Opposition to the Constitution". National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting against proposed constitution===
Gerry was also unhappy about the lack of expression of any sort of individual liberties in the proposed constitution, and generally opposed proposals that strengthened the central government.  He was one of only three delegates who voted against the proposed constitution in the convention (the others were [[George Mason]] and [[Edmund Randolph]]), citing a concern about the convention's lack of authority to enact such major changes to the nation's system of government, and to the constitution's lack of "[[federation|federal features]]".&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 159, 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===State ratification; Bill of Rights===
During the ratification debates that took place in the states following the convention, Gerry continued his opposition, publishing a widely circulated letter documenting his objections to the proposed constitution.&lt;ref name=Billias209&gt;Billias, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;  In this document he cited the lack of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as his primary objection, but also expressed qualified approval of the constitution, indicating that he would accept it with some amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 207–08&lt;/ref&gt;  Strong pro-Constitution forces attacked him in the press, comparing him unfavorably to the Shaysites.  [[Henry Jackson (general)|Henry Jackson]] was particularly vicious: "[Gerry has] done more injury to this country by that infamous Letter than he will be able to make atonement in his whole life",&lt;ref name=Billias209/&gt; and [[Oliver Ellsworth]], a convention delegate from [[Connecticut]], charged him with deliberately courting the Shays faction.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;  One consequence of the furor over his letter was that he was not selected as a delegate to the Massachusetts ratifying convention,&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; although he was later invited to attend by the convention's leadership.  The convention leadership was dominated by Federalists, and Gerry was not given any formal opportunity to speak; he left the convention after a shouting match with convention chair [[Francis Dana]].&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;  The state ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;  The debate had the result of estranging Gerry from a number of previously friendly politicians, including chairman Dana and [[Rufus King]].&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 207–08, 213&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States House of Representatives==
Anti-Federalist forces nominated Gerry for governor in 1788, but he was predictably defeated by the popular incumbent John Hancock.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;  Following ratification, Gerry recanted his opposition to the Constitution, noting that a number of state ratifying conventions had called for amendments that he supported.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;  He was nominated by friends (over his own opposition to the idea) for a seat in the inaugural House of Representatives, where he then served two terms.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 216, 243&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by Ezra Ames-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gerry supported the economic policies of Federalist [[Alexander Hamilton]] (portrait by [[Ezra Ames]]).]]
In June 1789 Gerry proposed that Congress consider all of the proposed constitutional amendments that various state ratifying conventions had called for (notably those of [[Rhode Island]] and [[North Carolina]], which had at the time still not ratified the constitution).&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  In the debate that followed, he led opposition to some of the proposals, arguing that they did not go far enough in ensuring individual liberties.  He successfully lobbied for inclusion of [[freedom of assembly]] in the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and was a leading architect of the [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] protections against search and seizure.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  He sought unsuccessfully to insert the word "expressly" into the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], which might have more significantly limited the federal government's power.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 233–34&lt;/ref&gt;  He was successful in efforts to severely limit the federal government's ability to control state militias.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem, with this protection, he had once argued against the idea of the federal government controlling a large [[standing army]], comparing it – most memorably and mischievously – to a standing [[human penis|penis]]: "An excellent assurance of domestic tranquility, but a dangerous temptation to foreign adventure."&lt;ref name=Isaacson&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|year=2003|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-684-80761-0|page=456|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Benjamin-Franklin/Walter-Isaacson/9780684807614|access-date=2013-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519095515/http://books.simonandschuster.com/Benjamin-Franklin/Walter-Isaacson/9780684807614|archive-date=2013-05-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry vigorously supported [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s reports on public credit, including the assumption at full value of state debts, and supported Hamilton's new [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], positions consistent with earlier calls he had made for economic centralization.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 223, 237&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he speculated in depreciated Continental bills of credit (the [[IOU (debt)|IOUs]] at issue), there is no evidence he participated in large-scale speculation that attended the debate when it took place in 1790, and he became a major investor in the new bank.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 240, 242&lt;/ref&gt;  He used the floor of the House to speak out against aristocratic and monarchical tendencies he saw as threats to [[Republicanism in the United States|republican ideals]], and generally opposed laws and their provisions that he perceived as limiting individual and state liberties.  He opposed any attempt to give officers of the executive significant powers, specifically opposing establishment of the [[United States Treasury Department|Treasury Department]] because its head might gain more power than the President.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;  He opposed measures that strengthened the Presidency (such as the ability to fire cabinet officers), seeking instead to give the legislature more power over appointments.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry did not stand for re-election in 1792, returning home to raise his children and care for his sickly wife.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  He agreed to serve as a presidential elector for John Adams in the [[United States presidential election, 1796|1796 election]].&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;  During Adams' term in office, Gerry maintained good relations with both Adams and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], hoping that the divided executive might lead to less friction.  His hopes were not realized: the split between Federalists (Adams) and Democratic-Republicans (Jefferson) widened.&lt;ref name=P51_52&gt;Purcell, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

==XYZ Affair==
{{main article|XYZ Affair}}
[[File:Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord by François Gérard, 1808.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]] (portrait by [[François Gérard]]) insisted Gerry remain in Paris after negotiations failed.]]
President Adams appointed Gerry to be a member of a special diplomatic commission sent to [[French First Republic|Republican France]] in 1797.&lt;ref name=Ferling345/&gt;  Tensions had risen between the two nations after the 1796 ratification of the [[Jay Treaty]], made between the United States and Great Britain.  It was seen by French leaders as signs of an Anglo-American alliance, and France had consequently stepped up seizures of American ships.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins and McKitrick, pp. 537–38&lt;/ref&gt;  Adams chose Gerry, over his cabinet's opposition (on political grounds that Gerry was insufficiently Federalist), because of their long-standing relationship; Adams described Gerry as one of the "two most impartial men in America" (Adams himself being the other).&lt;ref name=Ferling345&gt;Ferling, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry joined co-commissioners [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] and [[John Marshall]] in France in October 1797 and met briefly with Foreign Minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe, pp. 596–97&lt;/ref&gt;  Some days after that meeting, the delegation was approached by three French agents (at first identified as "X", "Y", and "Z" in published papers, leading the controversy to be called the "XYZ Affair") who demanded substantial bribes from the commissioners before negotiations could continue.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 268–69&lt;/ref&gt;  The commissioners refused, and sought unsuccessfully to engage Talleyrand in formal negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 272–75&lt;/ref&gt;  Believing Gerry to be the most approachable of the commissioners, Talleyrand successively froze first Pinckney and then Marshall out of the informal negotiations, and they left France in April 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe, pp. 598–613&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerry, who sought to leave with them, stayed behind because Talleyrand threatened war if he left.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerry refused to make any significant negotiations afterward and left Paris in August.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;  By then dispatches describing the commission's reception had been published in the United States, raising calls for war.&lt;ref&gt;Ferling, pp. 354–57&lt;/ref&gt; The undeclared naval [[Quasi-War]] (1798–1800) followed.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  Federalists, notably Secretary of State [[Timothy Pickering]], accused Gerry of supporting the French and abetting the breakdown of the talks, while Adams and Republicans such as Thomas Jefferson supported him.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 289–93&lt;/ref&gt;  The negative press damaged Gerry's reputation, and he was burned in effigy by protestors in front of his home.  He was only later vindicated, when his correspondence with Talleyrand was published.&lt;ref name=P51_52/&gt;  In response to the Federalist attacks on him, and because of his perception that the Federalist-led military buildup threatened republican values, Gerry formally joined the Democratic-Republican Party in early 1800, standing for election as [[Governor of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 289, 301&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of Massachusetts==
For four years Gerry unsuccessfully sought the governorship of Massachusetts.  His opponent in these races, Caleb Strong, was a popular moderate Federalist, whose party dominated the state's politics despite a national shift toward the Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Buel, pp. 39–44&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1803 Republicans in the state were divided, and Gerry only had regional support of the party.  He decided not to run in 1804, returning to semi-retirement&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 304–305&lt;/ref&gt; and to deal with a personal financial crisis.  His brother Samuel Russell had mismanaged his own business affairs, and Gerry had propped him up by guaranteeing a loan that was due.  The matter ultimately ruined Gerry's finances for his remaining years.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, pp. 305–06&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican [[James Sullivan (governor)|James Sullivan]] won the governor's seat from Strong in 1807, but his successor was unable to hold the seat in the 1809 election, which went to Federalist [[Christopher Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;Buel, pp. 73–82, 103–04&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerry stood for election again in 1810 against Gore, and won a narrow victory.  Republicans cast Gore as an ostentatious British-loving [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] who wanted to restore the monarchy (his parents had remained [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyal]] during the Revolution), and Gerry as a patriotic American, while Federalists described Gerry as a "French partizan" and Gore as an honest man devoted to ridding the government of foreign influence.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;  A temporary lessening in the threat of war with Britain aided Gerry.&lt;ref&gt;Buel, pp. 104–07&lt;/ref&gt;  The two battled again in 1811, with Gerry once again victorious in a highly acrimonious campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Buel, pp. 116–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Formisano, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|The word gerrymander (originally written Gerry-mander) was used for the first time in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' newspaper on March 26, 1812.&lt;ref name="Griffith 1907 72–73"&gt;Griffith, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing with the term, and helping spread and sustain its popularity, was this political cartoon, which depicts a state senate district in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]] as a strange animal with claws, wings and a dragon-type head, satirizing the district's odd shape.]]
Gerry's first year as governor was less controversial than his second, because the Federalists controlled the state senate.  He preached moderation in the political discourse, noting that it was important that the nation present a unified front in its dealings with foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;Buel, pp. 107–08&lt;/ref&gt;  In his second term, with full Republican control of the legislature, he became notably more partisan, purging much of the state government of Federalist appointees. The legislature also enacted "reforms" of the court system that resulted in an increase in the number of judicial appointments, which Gerry filled with Republican partisans.  Infighting within the party and a shortage of qualified candidates, however, played against Gerry, and the Federalists scored points by complaining vocally about the partisan nature of the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Buel, pp. 144–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Other legislation passed during Gerry's second year included a bill broadening the membership of Harvard's Board of Overseers to diversify its religious membership, and another that liberalized religious taxes.  The Harvard bill had significant political slant because the recent split between orthodox [[Congregationalist]]s and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] also divided the state to some extent along party lines, and Federalist Unitarians had recently gained control over the Harvard board.&lt;ref&gt;Formisano, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 the state adopted new constitutionally mandated electoral district boundaries.  The Republican-controlled legislature had created district boundaries designed to enhance their party's control over state and national offices, leading to some oddly shaped legislative districts.&lt;ref name="Hart_3_458"&gt;Hart, p. 3:458&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Gerry was unhappy about the highly partisan districting (according to his son-in-law, he thought it "highly disagreeable"), he signed the legislation.  The shape of one of the state senate districts in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]] was compared to a [[Salamanders_in_folklore_and_legend|salamander]] by a local Federalist newspaper in a political cartoon, calling it a "Gerry-mander".&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;  Ever since, the creation of such districts has been called [[gerrymander]]ing.&lt;ref name="Hart_3_458"/&gt;  Gerry also engaged in partisan investigations of potential libel against him by elements of the Federalist press, further damaging his popularity with moderates.  The redistricting controversy, along with the libel investigation and the impending [[War of 1812]], contributed to Gerry's defeat in 1812 (once again at the hands of Caleb Strong, whom the Federalists had brought out of retirement).&lt;ref&gt;Buel, pp. 148–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billias, p. 323"&gt;Billias, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[gerrymandering]]{{efn|gerrymandering is a process by which electoral districts are drawn with the aim of aiding the party in power, although its initial "g" has softened to {{IPAslink|dʒ}} rather than the hard {{IPAslink|ɡ}} of his name.&lt;ref&gt;Elster, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;}} of the state senate was a notable success in the 1812 election: the body was thoroughly dominated by Republicans, even though the house and the governor's seat went to Federalists by substantial margins.&lt;ref name="Griffith 1907 72–73"/&gt;

==Vice Presidency and death==
Gerry's financial difficulties prompted him to ask President [[James Madison]] for a federal position after his loss in the 1812 election (which was held early in the year).&lt;ref name="Billias, p. 323"/&gt;  He was chosen by the Democratic-Republican party congress to be Madison's vice presidential running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 1812|1812 presidential election]], although the nomination was first offered to [[John Langdon (politician)|John Langdon]].  He was viewed as a relatively safe choice who would attract Northern votes but not pose a threat to James Monroe, who was thought likely to succeed Madison.  Madison easily won reelection, and Gerry took the oath of office at Elmwood in March 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time the office of vice president was largely a sinecure; Gerry's duties included advancing the administration's agenda in Congress and dispensing patronage positions in New England.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Gerry's actions in support of the [[War of 1812]] had a partisan edge: he expressed concerns over a possible Federalist seizure of Fort Adams (as Boston's [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] was then known) as a prelude to Anglo-Federalist cooperation, and sought the arrest of printers of Federalist newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, p. 2:57&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Death}}
On November 23, 1814, he fell seriously ill while visiting [[Joseph Nourse]] of the Treasury Department,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To John Adams from Rufus King, 23 November 1814|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-6352|website=archive.gov|accessdate=12 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081248/http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-6352|archive-date=2015-05-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and died not long after returning to his home in the [[Seven Buildings]].&lt;ref name=Billias329&gt;Billias, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;  He is buried in the [[Congressional Cemetery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; with a memorial by [[John Frazee (sculptor)|John Frazee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=Frazee+John&amp;start=20|title=Search results for: Frazee John, page 2 - Collections Search Center, Smithsonian Institution|website=collections.si.edu|access-date=2013-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000150/http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=Frazee+John&amp;start=20|archive-date=2013-12-31|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the only signer of the Declaration buried in the nation's capital.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Schmidt, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The estate he left his wife and children was rich in land and poor in cash; he had managed to repay his brother's debts with his pay as vice president.&lt;ref name=Billias329/&gt; Aged 68 at the start of his Vice Presidency, he would be the oldest person to become Vice President until [[Charles Curtis]] in 1929.

==Legacy==
[[File:Elbridge Gerry House.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elbridge Gerry House]] in Marblehead]]
Gerry is generally remembered for the use of his name in the word ''[[Gerrymandering|gerrymander]]'', for his refusal to sign the United States Constitution, and for his role in the XYZ Affair.  His path through the politics of the age has been difficult to characterize; early biographers, including his son-in-law [[James T. Austin]] and [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], struggled to explain his apparent changes in position.  Biographer [[George Athan Billias]] posits that Gerry was a consistent advocate and practitioner of republicanism as it was originally envisioned,&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and that his role in the Constitutional Convention had a significant impact on the document it eventually produced.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry had ten children, of which seven survived into adulthood: Gerry's son, James Thompson Gerry, commanded the [[USS Albany (1846)|USS ''Albany'']], a [[United States Navy]] war sloop that went down with all hands in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Adams Family, ''Adams Family Correspondence, Volume 12'', Harvard University Press, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T8zeCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=James+Thompson+Gerry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBWoVChMIs7nm5dT3yAIVTDI-Ch1nRQL3#v=onepage&amp;q=James%20Thompson%20Gerry&amp;f=false editor's note p. 20].&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry's grandson [[Elbridge Thomas Gerry]] became a distinguished lawyer and philanthropist in New York. His great-grandson, [[Peter G.

Gerry's Landing Road in Cambridge, Massachusetts is located near the [[Eliot Bridge]] not far from Elmwood.  During the 19th century, the area was known as Gerry's Landing (formerly known as [[Sir Richard's Landing]]),  and was used by a Gerry relative for a short time as a landing and storehouse.&lt;ref&gt;''Publications of the Cambridge Historical Society'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bethell et al, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  The supposed house of his birth, the [[Elbridge Gerry House]] (it is uncertain whether he was born in the house currently standing on the site or an earlier structure) stands in Marblehead, and that town's Elbridge Gerry School is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=MAR.654|title=MACRIS Inventory: Elbridge Gerry House|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|access-date=2012-12-08|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222060902/http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=MAR.654|archive-date=2013-02-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=MAR.544|title=MACRIS Inventory: Eldridge&lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Gerry School|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|access-date=2012-12-08|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221223644/http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=MAR.544|archive-date=2013-02-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erna Low''' (28 July 1909 – 12 February 2002) was  an [[Austria]]n [[Jewish]]  businesswoman who settled in England and is best known for her work in the ski travel industry.

Low has been cited as a pioneer in the development of the [[package holiday]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pioneer of the package holiday|journal=Ski|date=September 1978|volume=43|issue=1|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was the founder of [http://www.ernalow.co.uk/ Erna Low] Travel Services Ltd. She worked in the holiday industry for over sixty years. She retired in 1995.

==Early years==

Low was born in [[Vienna]] in 1909 as the only daughter of Eduard Carl Lӧwe and his wife Emma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frary|first=Mark|title=Aiming High|year=2013|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=1780883544|pages=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnFHlhoQmLwC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=aiming+high+frary}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She remained in the city throughout her childhood and education.

She became the [[Austria]]n [[javelin throw|javelin]] champion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A talented athlete|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before moving to [[England]] in 1931, with ten borrowed pounds in her pocket, to research a [[PhD]] thesis on [[Lord de Tabley]], a Victorian poet and botanist. During her studies, Low traced the grandchildren of de Tabley and was invited to stay at the family home in [[Knutsford]], [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low invited to meet Lord de Tabley's family|newspaper=The Times|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in [[Bloomsbury]], Low earned a basic living as a language tutor, but decided that she needed to earn more to finance trips back to [[Austria]] to visit her sick mother and fulfil her passion for [[skiing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's desire to travel home|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low's business career in the travel industry began in 1932 when she placed an advertisement in the ''[[Morning Post]]''. It read:

'[[Winter Sports]] – [[Austria]], fortnight, £15 only, including rail and hotel, arranged by young Viennese Graduette for young people leaving [[Christmas]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's first advert|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low set up a permanent home in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and became a citizen in 1940, changing her name from Lӧwe to Low in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low changes her name|newspaper=The Independent|date=18 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== War Years ==

The outbreak of [[World War II]] made ski trips to [[Austria]] impossible, so Low planned alternative visits to [[Switzerland]].
 
For much of the war she worked for the [[BBC]] in [[Worcestershire]] where she would monitor German broadcasts for the Intelligence Service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Working for the BBC|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she disliked this role and chose to become a lecturer in the [[Army Education Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erna Low's occupation during the war|url=http://www.ernalow.co.uk/about-us-history|publisher=Erna Low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She then developed the 'house-party' concept. Low recognised that families were separated by war service and offered the opportunity for people to meet one another at [[Christmas]]. She leased [[boarding school]]s and invited paying guests to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'house party'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This venture became a company in 1946 and was later known as Enjoy Britain Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enjoy Britain Ltd.|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1947 – 1979: Erna Low Travel Service ==

In 1947, Low set up Erna Low Travel Service Ltd out of Reece Mews, South Kensington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lurotbrand.co.uk/flipbook/mewsnews2010-winter/ Mews News]. ''Lurot Brand. ''Published Winter 2010. Page 5. Retrieved 16 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked with schools to run school courses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Low runs school trips|journal=Climber and Rambler|year=1970|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and utilised the post-war demand for foreign travel to develop holidays for which the majority was paid before departure. A foreign exchange allowance of £50 meant that travel experts were in demand and Low's company provided this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low takes advantage of the foreign exchange allowance|newspaper=The Times|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low was very adept at finding new resorts for her clients in both the summer and winter market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'house party'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=February 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erna Low's 1948 brochure said: “[[Winter sports]] are on the map again”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's view of winter sports|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/27/guardianobituaries2|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by 1950, it included 24 continental trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Erna Low Travel Service Ltd expands|newspaper=The Independent|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Low placed emphasis on the personal touch and until the mid-1950s, she accompanied each group on their trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erna Low's personal touch|url=http://www.ernalow.co.uk/about-us-history|publisher=Erna Low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An all-inclusive fortnight in a first-class hotel with Erna Low cost 38 guineas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The all-inclusive holiday|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and after the introduction of [[charter flights]] in 1954, she even reduced costs by advising her clients to travel in ski clothes to save on excess baggage expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's eye for value|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=February 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weekend train trips to [[Austria]] became a regular feature in this period of the company's development and customers were provided with a music carriage for entertainment during their 24-hour rail journey on the 'snow train'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'Snow Train'|newspaper=The Independent|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low's business continued to grow and in 1972, with a staff of sixty and a turnover of £1.5 million, she opted to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low sells the company|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She bought her name back in 1975 with the business struggling, but sold again in 1979 to become a consultant to the travel industry.

== Late career ==

Low reinvented her company in 1981 under the name Erna Low Consultants Ltd. In this role, Low concentrated on developing the health spa market throughout [[Europe]]. She became the official representative in the [[UK]] of resorts at [[La Plagne]], [[Les Arcs]] and [[Flaine]], while she was decorated for her services to tourism by [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's honours|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low continued to work in the 1990s and gained membership of the [[Chartered Institute of Marketing]] for her feasibility study on [[Strathpeffer]]. She was also the vice-president of both the Kensington Chamber of Commerce and Women of the Year Association, and won a 'Women Mean Business' award at the age of 83.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Responsibilities|newspaper=The Times|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low handed control of the company to her successor and loyal employee, Joanna Yellowlees-Bound, in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low hands over the company|newspaper=The Independent|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000, the company was entered into the British Travel Industry's 'Hall of Fame'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry into the 'Hall of Fame'|url=http://www.ernalow.co.uk/about-us-history|publisher=Erna Low}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Low was renowned for her formidable style, and she was never known to avoid confrontation. On one occasion, a senior executive with a rival company won an award at a trade ceremony. Clearly bitter at a setback earlier in his career, he said: “You once refused to employ me, and look where I am now.” Low's response provided an insight into the way in which she worked. “I still wouldn't employ you,” she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low's confrontation with a former employee|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low was a consummate networker and taught royalty, actors and politicians to ski.

Despite her often intimidating façade, Low made many friends through business and while travelling. She was the godmother to a number of children, including the actress [[Emily Lloyd]], following a friendship with her grandmother, Uli Lloyd-Pack who worked for Low for over 30 years, and Uli Lloyd-Pack’s son, [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friendship with the Lloyd-Pack family|newspaper=The Times|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low never married and chose to live alone in [[South Kensington]] with her dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low lived alone|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1384767/Erna-Low.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=14 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

Low died at the age of 92 on 12 February 2002 at her home in [[London]].

'''Margarete Emma Dorothea''' "'''Grete'''" '''Mosheim''' (8 January 1905 &amp;ndash; 29 December 1986) was a German film, theatre, and television actress of Jewish ancestry (on her father's side).

==Early life==
Mosheim was born in [[Berlin]], Germany on 8 January 1905, the daughter of Markus Mosheim (1868-1956) and his wife Clara Mosheim née Hilger (1875-1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mosheim (Grete) papers |website=[[University of Southern California]] Libraries and Archives |url=http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/findingaids/mosheim/ |accessdate=30 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister was actress [[:de:Lore Mosheim]], who appeared in at least nine movies.

==Theatre==
Mosheim started her acting career at the age of 17 and was a member of [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]], Berlin from 1922 to 1931. She began studying at [[Max Reinhardt]]'s School of Drama under [[Berthold Held]] in early 1922, alongside [[Marlene Dietrich]].

Mosheim became established under Max Reinhardt, and in 1925 he gave her the chance to substitute in the play ''Der sprechende Affe''&lt;ref&gt;''The Speaking Ape''; original title: ''Le singe qui parle''.&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[René Fauchois]] when the female lead became ill. Mosheim learned the difficult role from [[Albert Bassermann]] in just 24 hours and became a [[superstar]] almost overnight. Until 1933, when she went to London to escape [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power, she was pre-eminent in the Berlin theatre scene. She performed in a wide variety of roles, being equally at home in drama and comedy. She also appeared in musical revues and recorded songs by [[Friedrich Hollaender]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Grete Mosheim ... Eine kleine Sehnsucht!  |medium=song }} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiBCz9z_pxg In YouTube].&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

After intensive study, she mastered English well enough to appear in ''Two Share a Dwelling''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 October 1935 |title=New plays and films in London |newspaper=The Straits Times  |p=19 }} [http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19351023-1.2.144.aspx In NewspaperSG - NLB].&lt;/ref&gt; in London in 1935. She appeared again on stage in Germany from 1952 on, but did not return to films - other than in a few TV roles - until her appearance as the grandmother in ''[[Moritz, Dear Moritz]]'' in 1978.

==Films==
Mosheim appeared in numerous German films, mostly silent movies, starting with ''Michael'' in 1924. Until she fled Germany in 1933, she starred in many films, including ''[[Dreyfus (1930 film)|Dreyfus]]'' (1930) and ''[[Yorck]]'' (1931). In 1935 she starred in the British film ''[[Car of Dreams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |people=[[Graham Cutts]], [[Austin Melford]] (directors) |year=1935 |title=Car of Dreams |medium=motion picture |website=Internet Archive |url=https://archive.org/details/CarOfDreams1935 |accessdate=30 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mosheim was married three times: to actor [[Oskar Homolka]] in Berlin (1928-1933), to industrialist [[Howard Gould]] in London (1937-1948) and to journalist Robert Cooper, who was a correspondent for [[The Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andreas Bornemann |title=Grete Mosheim (1905-1986)|website=Postkarten-Archiv |language=de |url=http://www.postkarten-archiv.de/grete-mosheim.html |accessdate=30 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Greta Mosheim, 81, A German Leading Lady Of The Theater |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/30/obituaries/greta-mosheim-81-a-german-leading-lady-of-the-theater.html |website=New York Times - Obituaries |accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had no children.

[[Prince]] '''Ivan Sergeyevich Obolensky''' (born 15 May 1925) is an American New York City-based [[financial analyst]] and corporate officer. He was previously commissioned in the [[United States Navy]], serving as a Flight Lieutenant, and has also been a publisher.&lt;ref name=thing/&gt;

==Early life==
Obolensky was born in London, [[Middlesex]], on 15 May 1925, to [[Serge Obolensky|Sergei Platonovich "Serge" Obolensky]] and [[Ava Alice Muriel Astor]]. Through his mother, he is a great-great-great-grandson of [[John Jacob Astor]] and the elder grandson of [[John Jacob Astor IV]], who died on the [[RMS Titanic]].&lt;ref name=thing/&gt;

Ivan was educated at [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island, and graduated from [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], Connecticut, in 1947. While at Yale, he was a member of [[St. Elmo (secret society)|St. Elmo]], a senior [[secret society]].

==Career==
After Yale, Obolensky became a writer working for Telavid Inc. Imports, and went on to serve with the [[United States Navy]] as a pilot. In 1957, he formed a publishing firm McDowell, Obolensky Inc. with a partner, David McDowell. The firm published [[James Agee]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]] novel, ''[[A Death in the Family]]'' (1957), and was the U.S. publisher for [[Chinua Achebe]]'s ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' (1959). It was dissolved in 1960. Obolensky then formed a second publishing house, Ivan Obolensky, Inc. This firm continued through 1965, when he joined the investment banking firm of A. T. Brod &amp; Company as a partner.&lt;ref name=thing&gt;{{cite news |title=The Media Business: Financial Analyst of Publishing Companies Who's Done a Thing or Two |author=[[Edwin McDowell]]  |date=9 October 1989 |work=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/09/business/media-business-financial-analyst-publishing-companies-who-s-done-thing-two.html|quote=Even if there were such a thing as a typical Wall Street investment banker, Ivan Obolensky, the senior vice president of research for Josephthal &amp; Company, would not be it. That is, not unless the typical investment banker was also the London-born son of a Russian prince and a grandson of John Jacob Astor, who is said to have been the wealthiest man in America when he went down with the Titanic. Mr. Obolensky, 64 years old, is also a Yale graduate, novelist, former United States Navy pilot and one-time book publisher whose first list produced James Agee's Pulitzer Prize novel, ''A Death in the Family.'' .....}}&lt;/ref&gt;The publishing house continued until 1968 under the name Astor-Honor.

Throughout his main career on [[Wall Street]] as a [[financial analyst]], Obolensky has covered many prestigious accounts. He was Vice President of Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook &amp; Weeden Inc., [[Brokerage firm|Stock brokers]] and is currently Vice President of Shields &amp; Company.  Obolensky is an active member of the philanthropic community in New York.  He has, for many years, been an active supporter of the [[Soldiers', Sailors', Marines', Coast Guard and Airmen's Club]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704380504575530460412010040 |title=A Welcome Mat for Soldiers and Sailors |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New York's [[International Debutante Ball]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.com/2010/12/the-luckiest-girls-in-the-world-white-tie-endures-at-the-international-debutante-ball/ |title=The Luckiest Girls in the World |work=[[The New York Observer]] |date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which benefits the club.

The {{nihongo|'''Consulate-General of Japan in Houston'''|在ヒューストン日本国総領事館|''Zai Hyūsuton Nippon-koku Sōryōjikan''}} is [[Japan]]'s diplomatic facility in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]]. It is located in Suite 3000 at [[2 Houston Center]], which is located at 900 Fannin Street in [[Downtown Houston]]. The consulate serves Texas and [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/jicc/HoustonLink.htm Consulate-General of Japan in Houston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629075939/http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/jicc/HoustonLink.htm |date=2008-06-29 }}." [[Embassy of Japan in Washington, D.C.]] Retrieved on December 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At one point the consulate was located in Suite 5300 and later Suite 2300 in the [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Houston)|Wells Fargo Plaza]] (formerly the First Interstate Bank Plaza).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.library.ohiou.edu/subjects/eastasia/diplomat.htm East Asia Diplomatic Representatives in the United States]."

For a decade ending in 1993 the consulate refused to pay "user fees" billed to the consulate by the [[Piney Point Village, Texas|City of Piney Point Village]] in the [[Greater Houston Area]]. The consul general residence is in Piney Point Village. The Japanese argued that this was a tax and that diplomatic facilities should not be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;Tolson, Mike.

''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Tuesday September 21, 1993. A11. Retrieved on January 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the city announced that the consulate owed the city around $14,000 [[United States dollar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3D3B4313CF8B8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM City says Japan owes $14,000 consulate debt]." ''[[Associated Press]]''. September 22, 1993. Retrieved on December 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese argued that international agreements exempted consulate facilities from taxes, while Piney Point Village said the annual fees were for user services. James Baker, a Piney Point Village alderman, threatened to suspend garbage pickup services and expose the Japanese consulate to ridicule. In September of that year a [[U.S. State Department]] letter stated that consulates should pay legitimate user fees, and that consulates do not have to pay for fire and police services. The consulate paid almost $12,000, including $4,500 in interest, to the city. According to Vice-Consul Takaki Takinami originally the city charged $14,915.52 before changing the invoice and deducting police and fire costs. Shojiro Imanishi (今西 正次郎 ''Imanishi Shōjirō''), who was the outgoing consul-general, agreed to pay $4,500 annually.&lt;ref&gt;Tolson, Mike.

'''Julian Brind''' MW (5 November 1942 – 19 December 2010) was a British [[Master of Wine]] and director of buying wines, beers, spirits and soft drinks for the [[Waitrose]] supermarket chain.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8279682/Julian-Brind.html |title=Julian Brind: Obituaries Supermarket buyer who introduced Britons to the wines of the New World |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brind was a key figure in the transformation of the British wine trade from the 1970s onwards.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2859653.ece |title=Julian Brind: Influential wine trader who was the first to ship New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc to Britain in 1973 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=1 January 2011 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Julian Brind was born in [[Scotland]] and educated at [[Strathallan School]] in Perthshire.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; After school he followed his father into the wine and spirits trade joining Brown &amp; Pank, part of [[Watney, Combe &amp; Reid|Watney Mann Breweries]] as a management trainee.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="decanter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decanter.com/news/wine-news/511078/julian-brind-dies |title=Julian Brind |magazine=[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter]] |date=21 December 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Brind started buying wine under the direction of Don Lovell MW, who put him forward for the Vintners' Scholarship, which he was awarded in 1967.&lt;ref name="decanter" /&gt; In the same year he also won the Bourse de Voyage scholarship.&lt;ref name="offlicencenews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.offlicencenews.co.uk/news/archivestory.php/aid/3406/Wine_trade_mourns_death_of_Julian_Brind_MW.html |title=Wine trade mourns death of Julian Brind MW |newspaper=Off Licence News |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Brind passed the Master of Wine exam and joined Waitrose to lead the wine buying team in 1971.&lt;ref name="decanter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="drinksbusiness" /&gt;

When Brind joined Waitrose in the early seventies the wine consumer in Britain was served by the traditional wine merchant selling [[Old World wine]] from prestigious European growers.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; Selling wine in supermarkets was in its infancy.&lt;ref name="indie" /&gt; Brind recognised that there was an opportunity to introduce the consumer to new wines from all over the world.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; In 1973 he was the first buyer to introduce [[New Zealand wine|New Zealand]] [[Sauvignon blanc]] to Britain.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; Nonetheless, Brind did not neglect the traditional European market; instigating the [[Vin de pays]] revolution from southern [[French wine|France]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; So began the interest in [[New World wine]] and a cultural shift away from the traditional wine merchant toward the supermarket.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

Born in [[Samtredia]], a town in [[Imereti|Imereti Province]], Kaladze comes from a footballing family as his father played for [[FC Samtredia|Lokomotiv Samtredia]] and was also president of the team for some time. His brother was kidnapped in a high-profile case in 2001 and officially declared dead in 2006, resulting in two men being sentenced to [[prison]] for a combined total of 30 years. Outside of football, he owns a company called Kala Capital and an organisation called Kala Foundation, as well as being an ambassador for [[SOS Children's Villages]]. He is married to Anouki Areshidze, with whom he has three children.

Kaladze became involved in the politics of Georgia as a member of the opposition [[Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia]] party, founded by [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]] in February 2012.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Kaladze started his career playing as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for his local club [[FC Samtredia|Lokomotiv Samtredia]], where his father was president, until former Georgia international footballer [[David Kipiani]] requested Kakha to join [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]].&lt;ref name="World Soccer"/&gt; At Dinamo, he played in 82 domestic league games and scored one goal.&lt;ref name="Eurosport profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/kakha-kaladze.html|title=Eurosport – Kakha Kaladze|publisher=Eurosport|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his top-flight debut as a 16-year-old with Dinamo during the [[1993–94 Umaglesi Liga|1993–94 campaign]].&lt;ref name="Football Database profile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.footballdatabase.com/index.php?page=player&amp;Id=796&amp;pn=Kakhaber_Kaladze|title=Football Database profile|publisher=Football Database|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Captain Kaladze looks to lift the gloom"/&gt; Kaladze claims that a good performance against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] while playing for Georgia in a match that ended 0–0 brought him to the attention of [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]; he later said, "In that game I was up against [[Christian Vieri]] and I [[Man-to-man marking|marked]] him well."&lt;ref name="World Soccer"/&gt;

A fee equivalent to €280,000 was enough to take him to the [[Ukrainian Premier League]] and Dynamo Kiev in January 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stats.sports.theglobeandmail.com/seri/players.asp?player=16975|title=No.4 Kakhaber Kaladze|publisher=''Globe and Mail''|accessdate=2009-08-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he signed a four-year deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/1134373.stm|title=AC Milan sign Kaladze|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2001-01-24|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he scored six goals in 71 league games over the two-and-a-half seasons he spent there.&lt;ref name="Eurosport profile"/&gt; The Ukrainian club had been under the ownership of [[Hryhoriy Surkis]] and the late [[Valeriy Lobanovskyi]] had just been installed as [[Coach (sport)|manager]]; they would go on to win eight consecutive league titles.&lt;ref name="FC Dynamo Kyiv - 1992-2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fcdynamo.kiev.ua/en/history/period5/5330.html|title=FC Dynamo Kyiv – 1992–2006|publisher=FC Dynamo Kyiv|accessdate=2009-08-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505070827/http://www.fcdynamo.kiev.ua/en/history/period5/5330.html|archivedate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaladze also appeared in [[Two-legged tie|both legs]] of the semi-final of the [[1998–99 UEFA Champions League|1998–99 Champions League]] against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], which Dynamo Kyiv lost 4–3 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-jancker-seals-bayern-comeback-1085908.html|title=Jancker seals Bayern comeback|publisher=''The Independent''|date=2009-04-08|accessdate=2009-08-08|author=Yuri Kozak | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-baslers-wonder-goal-takes-bayern-to-barcelona-1088886.html|title=Basler's wonder goal takes Bayern to Barcelona|publisher=''The Independent''|date=2009-04-22|accessdate=2009-08-08|author=Andrew Warshaw | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; En route to the semi-finals, they beat teams like [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="FC Dynamo Kyiv - 1992-2006"/&gt; He won eight league titles in a row during his time at both Dinamo Tbilisi and Dynamo Kyiv.&lt;ref name="Kaladze fighting his grief"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/apr/16/championsleague|title=Kaladze fighting his grief in Milan defence|publisher=''The Observer''|author=Amy Lawrence|date=2006-04-16|accessdate=2009-06-29 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Kaladze became the most expensive Georgian footballer in history when [[A.C.

==Political career==

===Business ventures===
Along with his football career, Kaladze is an investor in Georgia, Italy, [[Ukraine]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=17489|title=Ex-PM Chairs Soccer Star’s Business Group|publisher=Civil.ge|date=2008-03-31|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaladze owns Kala Capital, an investment company established in 2008 in Georgia with a focus on energy businesses,&lt;ref name="Transparency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.ge/en/post/general-announcement/possible-conflict-interests-kakha-kaladze|title=Possible conflict of interests of Kakha Kaladze|date=22 October 2012|publisher=Transparency International Georgia|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose chief executive is former Georgian Prime Minister [[Zurab Noghaideli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamestownfoundation.blogspot.com/2010/01/former-prime-minister-zurab-noghaideli.html|title=Jamestown Foundation Blog: Former Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli: Putin’s New Pick for Georgia?|author=Jamestown Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaladze's other businesses include the [[Buddha Bar]] in [[Kiev]] that opened in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhabar.com.ua/eng/buddabar/history|title=История лаунж-ресторана "Buddha-bar"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-16987.html&lt;/ref&gt; Kaladze is also the owner of a restaurant called Giannino, founded in 1899 by Giannino Bindi, which is based in Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ristorantegiannino.it/|title=Ristorante Giannino|publisher=Ristorantegiannino.it|accessdate=2009-08-17|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2321763/Clubs-set-to-cash-in-from-Chelsea-exodus.html|title=Clubs set to cash in from Chelsea exodus|publisher=''The Telegraph''|date=2007-09-23|accessdate=2009-08-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant has had a [[Michelin Guide|Michelin star]] under Davide Oldani and the chef in charge was Roberto Molinari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.olmoantico.it/data/allegati/allegati/Corriere%20della%20Sera%20ed.Milano%20-%2005%20Giugno%202006%20-%20Continuazione%20Acanto.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.chef-consultant.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Kala Capital owned 45 percent of the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company company SakHidroEnergoMsheni, a joint stock company incorporated in Georgia in 1998.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} His candidacy as [[Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (Georgia)|Minister of Energy and Natural Resources]] in October 2012 was therefore overshadowed by concerns about a serious risk that a conflict of interests might arise.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Transparency International Georgia http://transparency.ge/en/node/2472&lt;/ref&gt; Reports on the same day indicated that Kaladze might refuse the energy portfolio or sell off his shares in Georgia Hydropower Construction Company within 10 days of his appointment.&lt;ref&gt;http://greenalt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Kakha-Kaladze-Makes-a-Statement-on-a-Possible-Conflict-of-Interest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political office and conflict of interests===
Kaladze became involved in the politics of Georgia as a member of the opposition [[Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia]] party founded by [[billionaire]] [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]] in February 2012. He was elected to the [[Parliament of Georgia]] on 1 October 2012. He was approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as [[Ministry of Energy (Georgia)|Minister of Energy]] in the [[cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili]] on 25 October 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The appointment was met with skepticism in professional energy circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/All-that-Glitters-is-Gold-for-Georgias-Sexy-New-Energy-Minister.html|title=All that Glitters is Gold for Georgia's Sexy New Energy Minister|date=17 October 2012|work=OilPrice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy-Voices/2012/1019/Georgia-installs-soccer-star-as-energy-minister|title=Georgia installs soccer star as energy minister|author=The Christian Science Monitor|date=19 October 2012|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, it stirred an intense debate on a [[conflict of interest]] arising from Kaladze's business interests in the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company, in which Kala Capital owned 45 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.ghn.ge/news-6734.html|title=Kakha Kaladze owns the shares of "Sakhidromsheni" - News Agency - GHN|work=News Agency GHN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kala Capital sold the shares to GMC Group in November 2012 but concerns whether his indirect commercial interests had been abandoned remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpressnews.ge/en/economics/42012-process-of-selling-kakhi-kaladzes-shares-in-sakhidromsheni-is-over.html?ar=A|title=Process of Selling Kakhi Kaladze’s shares in "Sakhidromsheni" is Over - News Agency InterpressNews|work=interpressnews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mayor of Tbilisi===

In July 2017, Kaladze resigned as Energy minister in order to run for Tbilisi mayor in the upcoming local elections. On 22 October, he was elected mayor as a candidate of Georgian Dream, winning the elections with 51℅ of the votes. He was sworn in on 13 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Antidze|first1=Margarita|title=Former soccer star Kaladze becomes mayor of Georgia's capital|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-georgia-election/former-soccer-star-kaladze-becomes-mayor-of-georgias-capital-idUKKBN1CR0MU|accessdate=1 April 2018|publisher=Reuters|date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9406">A '''land contract''' — often described by [[#Other names|other terminology listed below]] — is a contract between the buyer and seller of [[real property]] in which the seller provides the buyer [[credit (finance)|financing]] in the purchase, and the buyer repays the resulting loan in [[Hire purchase|installments]]. Under a land contract, the seller retains the legal [[Title (property)|title]] to the property, while permitting the buyer to take possession of it for most purposes other than legal ownership. The sale price is typically paid in periodic installments, often with a [[balloon payment]] at the end to make the [[timelength]] of payments shorter than in the corresponding fully [[Amortization|amortized]] loan (i.e., a loan without a final balloon payment). When the full purchase price has been paid including any [[interest]], the seller is obligated to [[Conveyancing|convey]] (to the buyer) legal title to the property. An initial [[down payment]] from the buyer to the seller is usually also required.  

The [[land contract law|legal status of land contracts]] varies between jurisdictions.{{vague|date= October 2016|reason = implausible that correlation between "region[s]" and "legal status[es]" is more than — well, let's call it "a vague" — tendency.}}

Since a land contract specifies the sale of a specific item of [[real estate]] between a seller and buyer, a land contract can be considered a special type of [[real estate contract]]. In the usual, more conventional real estate contracts, a seller does not provide a loan to the buyer; the contract either does not specify a loan or includes provisions for a loan from a different "third party" lender, usually a financial institution in practice. When third party lenders are involved, typically a [[lien]], as part of a [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] or [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]], is placed on the property, in which the property serves as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] until the loan is repaid.

{{anchor|Other names}}Other terms for a land contract include:

* contract for deed
* agreement for deed
* land installment contract
* installment sale agreement

==Installment payments==
It is common for the installment payments of the purchase price to be similar to mortgage payments in amount and effect.  The amount is often determined according to a mortgage [[amortization schedule]]. In effect, each installment payment is partial payment of the purchase price and partial payment of interest on the unpaid purchase price. This is similar to mortgage payments which are part repayment of the principal amount of the mortgage loan and part interest.  As the buyer pays more toward the principal of the loan over time, his(her) equity (equitable title or equitable interest) in the property increases. For example, if a buyer pays a $2000 down payment and borrows $8000 for a $10000 parcel of land, and pays off in installments another $4000 of this loan (not including interest), the buyer has $6000 of equity in the land (which is 60% of the equitable title), but the seller holds legal title to the land as recorded in documentation ([[deed]]s) in a government [[Recorder of deeds|recorder's office]] until the loan is completely paid off.  However, if the buyer defaults on installment payments, the land contract may consider the failure to timely pay installments a [[breach of contract]] and the land equity may revert to the seller, depending on the land contract provisions.

Since land contracts can easily be written or modified by any seller or buyer; one may come across any variety of repayment plans. Interest only, [[negative amortization]]s, short balloons, extremely long amortizations just to name a few.  It is not uncommon for land contracts to go unrecorded. For several reasons, the buyer or seller may decide that the contract is not to be recorded in the register of deeds. This does not make the contract invalid, but it does increase exposure to undesirable side effects.  Some states, such as Minnesota, issue contracts without an [[acceleration clause]], which in the case of a default leaves the seller in a position to either cancel the contract, discharging any principal deficiency, as in the case of deprecation, or to litigate for 18 months or more while letting the buyer, if not a corporation, retain their rights to the property while collection attempts are made, by which time the buyer will often qualify for bankruptcy, making the contract, when lacking said [[acceleration clause]], effectively an installment option, when the buyer has no other lienable assets.  In bankruptcy, some regions will interpret it as an [[executory contract]] that can be rejected, while others will treat it as a debt to be paid out of the bankruptcy trust.  This and a wide variety of other legal ambiguities has led to a trend toward eliminating the use of Land Contracts to remove any incentives, and as a result, the disadvantages that these contracts have compared to the standard note and mortgage, which are more clearly defined in, and regulated by, law.  &lt;ref name="nature of contract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_199801/ai_n8759824/pg_19/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912193027/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_199801/ai_n8759824/pg_19/ |archivedate=2010-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for a land contract==
Although most land contracts can be used for a variety of reasons, their most common use is as a form of short-term seller financing. Usually, but not always, the date on which the full amount of the purchase price is due will be years sooner than when the purchase price would be paid in full according to the amortization schedule.  This results in the final payment being a large [[balloon payment]].  Since the amount of the final payment is so large, the buyer may obtain a conventional mortgage loan from a bank to make the final payment.  Land contracts are sometimes used by buyers who do not qualify for conventional mortgage loans offered by a traditional lending institution, for reasons of unestablished or poor credit or an insufficient down payment.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  Land contracts are also used when the seller is eager to sell and the buyer is not given enough time to arrange for conventional financing.

There can be other advantages of using a land contract too.  When a third-party lender, such as a financial institution, provides a loan, this third party has its own interests to protect against the other two parties involved, the seller and buyer.  Establishing the correct title and value of the property to be used as collateral is important to the lender.  Thus, the lender commonly requires title service including title search and [[title insurance]] by an independent title company, [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]] and termite inspection of the property to ensure it has sufficient value, a [[Cadastre|land survey]] to ensure there are no encroachments, and use of lawyers to ensure the [[closing (real estate)|closing]] is done correctly.  These third party lender requirements add to [[closing costs]] which the lender requires the seller and/or buyer to pay.  If the seller is also the lender, these costs are usually not required by the seller and may result in closing cost savings and fewer complications.  It may also be the seller's position that if the buyer requires any of these services, he could pay for the costs and make arrangements himself.  For properties where only relatively undeveloped land is involved and if the seller is willing to finance, the price of the empty land may be so low that the conventional closing costs are not worthwhile and can be an impediment to a quick, simple sale.  Easy financing and a simple sale transaction may be a good selling point for a seller to offer a buyer.

A land contract is a unilateral contract and cannot be assigned to another buyer without the consent of the seller providing the financing.

== Consumer-protection concerns {{anchor|Concerns Growing}} ==
Because of growing concerns that sales via land contract might violate [[truth in lending]] laws, the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) is considering regulating these real estate sales.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/business/dealbook/contract-for-deed-lending-gets-federal-scrutiny.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, Texas law was changed to automatically place the legal title to the property with the buyer by filing the contract with the deed records office of the county where the property is located.  While the seller loses title, the seller retains a vendor's lien in the property for the outstanding balance of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinburgpolitics.com/2015/06/01/protections-for-low-income-texas-homeowners-including-thousands-who-live-in-colonias-approved-by-the-legislature-says-rep-canales/&lt;/ref&gt;

Brilliant, a technology patent holder, has been the CEO of public companies and venture backed start-ups. He was the inaugural Executive Director of [[Google.org]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodell|first1=Jeff|title=The Guru of Google|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/from-the-issue-the-guru-of-google-20080404|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the charitable arm of [[Google]] established in 2005, and the first CEO of [http://www.skollglobalthreats.org Skoll Global Threats Fund], established in 2009 by eBay founder [[Jeffrey Skoll|Jeff Skoll]] to address [[climate change]], [[Pandemic|pandemics]], [[water security]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|conflict in the Middle East]]. Brilliant currently serves as the Chairman of the Board of [http://www.endingpandemics.org Ending Pandemics], and is also on the boards of the [[Skoll Foundation]], [http://www.salesforce.org Salesforce.org], [http://www.seva.org The Seva Foundation], and [http://www.dharma.ai Dharma Platform]. 

From 1973 to 1976, Brilliant participated in the successful [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) [[smallpox]] eradication program.

==Early life==
Born in [[Detroit, Michigan]], Brilliant received his undergraduate training as well as his MPH degree (Masters in Public Health) from the [[University of Michigan]], where he worked on the staff of the [[Gargoyle Humor Magazine]], and his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from [[Wayne State University School of Medicine]]. He moved to [[California]] for his [[internship]] at the [[California Pacific Medical Center]], and developed [[Parathyroid Cancer|parathyroid cancer]] from which he recovered. Brilliant is board certified in preventive medicine and public health.

In 1969, a group of American Indians from many different tribes, calling themselves Indians of All Tribes, [[Occupation of Alcatraz|occupied the Alcatraz island]] in San Francisco.  A call went out for doctors to help a pregnant woman there give birth and Brilliant joined their occupation as unofficial doctor.&lt;ref name="mindfully"&gt;{{cite web| date = 24 February 2006| url = http://www.mindfully.org/Technology/2006/Larry-Brilliant-Technology24feb06.htm| title = Larry Brilliant: Doctor Looks to Use Technology to Aid Global Health Care| publisher = Wall Street Journal| accessdate = 2007-07-26| author = Hoge, Patrick| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071101072602/http://www.mindfully.org/Technology/2006/Larry-Brilliant-Technology24feb06.htm| archivedate = 1 November 2007| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Larry Brilliant at Spotlight Health Aspen Ideas Festival 2015 - 1.JPG|thumb|right|Brilliant in 2015]]
After the US government forced the Indians of All Tribes off Alcatraz, Brilliant became a media darling which led to a movie company casting him in ''Medicine Ball Caravan''—a sequel to the hit [[Woodstock Nation]]—playing a doctor in a film about a tribe of hippies who follow the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], and [[Joni Mitchell]].&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2000| url = http://www.fastcompany.com/online/39/brilliant.html| title = Dr. Brilliant Vs. the Devil of Ambition| publisher = fastcompany.com| accessdate = 2007-07-26| last = Harriet Rubin| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231816/http://www.fastcompany.com/online/39/brilliant.html| archivedate = 2007-09-27| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cast was paid with airline tickets to [[India]]. Brilliant and some others cashed their tickets in and rented a bus to drive around Europe, which then turned into a relief convoy to help victims of the [[1970 Bhola cyclone|1970 Bhola cyclone in Bangladesh]] (then East Pakistan).

Civil unrest stopped the relief caravan so he spent several years in India studying at a [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[ashram]] with [[Neem Karoli Baba]] (a [[Hindu]] sage) from whom he received the name Subramanyum. After about a year [[Neem Karoli Baba]] advised Brilliant to eradicate [[smallpox]], a project on which he would spend the next several years.  He participated, as a medical officer, in the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) [[smallpox]] eradication program that in 1980 certified the global eradication of smallpox.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web|year=2000 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/ |title=Smallpox |accessdate=2007-07-26 |publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921235036/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/ |archivedate=2007-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brilliant found that Indian officials became more receptive to his efforts when they learned of Neem Karoli Baba's involvement, to which he credits a significant portion of the program's success.&lt;ref name=miracle&gt;Ram Dass (1995). ''Miracle of Love: Stories about Neem Karoli Baba''. Hanuman Foundation. 4th ed., [http://hanumanfdn.org/pdfs/MoL-TheStick.pdf Chapter 9: The Stick That Heals], pp. 155-161. {{ISBN|978-1-887474-00-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brilliant contributed a seven-page account of his experiences to the book ''Miracle of Love: Stories of Neem Karoli Baba''.&lt;ref name=miracle/&gt;

In December 1978, he became a co-founder and chairman of [[Seva Foundation]], an international, non-profit, health foundation. Seva's projects in places like [[Tibet]], [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Guatemala]] have given back sight to more than 3 million blind people through surgery, self-sufficient eye care systems, and low cost manufacturing of [[intraocular lense]]s. One important contribution of his was his helping to set up the [[Aravind Eye Hospital]] in [[Madurai]], India.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

When he returned to the United States, he became a professor of international health at the [[University of Michigan]] as well as starting numerous charitable and business ventures.

In 1985, he co-founded, with [[Stewart Brand]], [[WELL (virtual community)|The Well]], a prototypic [[online community]] that has been the subject of multiple books and studies.  ''Time magazine'' said, "Well was a huge hit, a precursor of every online business from Amazon.com to eBay."&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite web |date= April 21, 2003| url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1004713,00.html| title = Will You Buy WiFi?| publisher = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]]| accessdate = 2007-07-26 | author=Taylor, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent the first half of 2005 as a volunteer helping out in [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|the tsunami]] in [[Sri Lanka]] and working in India with WHO in the campaign to eradicate [[polio]].

On February 22, 2006, [[Google|Google Inc.]] appointed him as the Executive Director of [[Google.org]], the philanthropic arm of Google,&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web |date=September 14, 2006| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/technology/14google.html?ei=5090&amp;en=56861c8f4ca9b3e7&amp;ex=1315886400&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1185372545-ivq5NRvaEOg4wFTGfEZP9Q| title = Philanthropy Google’s Way: Not the Usual |work=NY Times |accessdate = 2007-07-25 | author=Hafner, Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position which he held until April, 2009,&lt;ref name="leavesgoogle"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 14, 2009| url= http://blog.google.org/2009/04/brilliant-takes-on-urgent-threats.html| title = Brilliant Takes on Urgent Threats| publisher = Google |accessdate = 2009-06-25 | author=Dr. Larry Brilliant}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he joined the Skoll Foundation, as its President, the philanthropic organization established by former eBay president Jeff Skoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google loses Brilliant to rival foundation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/apr/15/google-org-larry-brilliant |publisher=The Guardian |date=15 April 2009  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, he was awarded the [[TED Prize]], granting him $100,000 and 'One Wish to Change the World'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Zetter, Kim | url = https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70280-0.html |title = Brilliant's Wish: Disease Alerts |publisher = Wired.com | date = 2006-02-23 | accessdate = 2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he presented at TED in July 2006.

In May 2013, he gave the commencement speech at [[Harvard School of Public Health]],

He said that "the arc of moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice".

...

Here is what I ask of you: Imagine that arc of history that Martin Luther King inspired is right here with us. The arc of the universe needs your help to bend it towards justice. It will not happen on its own. The arc of history will not bend towards justice without you bending it. Public health needs you to insure health for all. Seize that history. Bend that arc. I want you to leap up, to jump up and grab that arc of history with both hands, and yank it down, twist it, and bend it. Bend it towards fairness, bend it towards better health for all, bend it towards justice!&lt;ref name=har&gt;{{cite web| title =  " HSPH News " Commencement 2013: Larry Brilliant’s address|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health| url = http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/commencement-2013-larry-brilliants-address/ |date=May 30, 2013| accessdate = 2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Legal management''' (also offered as: legal studies, or paralegal studies) is an [[academic]] and  [[professional]] discipline that is a hybrid between the study of [[law]] and [[management]] (i.e. business administration, public administration, etc.). It is generally considered as the best preparatory law program for those who aspire to become members of a [[Bar (law)|bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BS Legal Management|url=http://www.finduniversity.ph/majors/bs-in-legal-management-philippines/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, alumni of legal management programmes pursue a [[professional degree]] in law such as [[Juris Doctor]] (JD) or [[Bachelor of Laws]] (Ll.B.) while some profess as [[paralegals]], law clerks, political analysts, politicians, public administrators, entrepreneurs, business executives, or pursue careers in the [[academe]].

The degree was designed in the [[Philippines]] and was first introduced in [[Ateneo de Manila University]] in the 1980s by former [[Philippine Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice]] [[Renato Corona]]. It is also offered in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalparalegal.edu/Bachelors.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; most notably, at the [[University of California Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;http://legalstudies.berkeley.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal management student organisations across the Philippines are represented by the Alliance of Legal Management Associations of the Philippines (ALMAP) to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], as a [[non-stock]], [[non-profit]], student-run corporation. Timothy Caday is the national president of ALMAP for the academic year 2017-2018.

==Curriculum==
Legal management is currently offered in multiple degree formats depending on the offering [[college]] or [[university]]. Its variety and flexibility is a focal point among schools that have it in their roster of [[academic degrees]]. Some capitalise in the [[legal]] aspects, while others for the [[business]] aspects. Some schools may offer the degree either as a predominantly preparatory law programme, a [[liberal arts]] focused programme, or a business and [[management]] programme. Core subjects include: [[law]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]] and [[management]] (public and business). Depending on the school, the ratio of law courses to management courses vary between 40:60 to 90:10. Graduate degrees in the discipline are offered in multiple colleges and universities in the United States.

Variations of the discipline can be conferred either as the following undergraduate degrees:
* [[Bachelor of Science]] in Legal Management (BSc Legal Management)
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Legal Management (AB Legal Management)
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Legal Studies (AB Legal Studies)
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Paralegal Studies (AB Paralegal Studies)
* [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Business Administration]] major in Legal Management (BSc BA Legal Management)

A number of major airlines have declared [[bankruptcy]] and have either ceased operations, or reorganized under [[reorganization|bankruptcy protection]]. Airlines, like any business, are susceptible to market fluctuations and economic difficulties. The economic structure of the airline industry may contribute to airline bankruptcies as well. One major element in almost every airline bankruptcy is the rejection by the debtor of its current collective bargaining agreements with employees. After satisfying certain requirements, bankruptcy law permits courts to approve rejection of labor contracts by the debtor-employer. With this tool, airline managers reduce costs. Terms of an employee contract negotiated over years can be eliminated in months through Chapter 11. Terms of the Railway Labor Act, amended in 1936 to cover airlines, prevent most labor union work actions before, during and after an airline bankruptcy.

== Timeline ==
This is a timeline of [[airline]]s who have filed for bankruptcy protection. Also see [[list of defunct airlines]] for a list of airlines which are no longer operating.

The '''Master of Accountancy''' ('''M.Acc.''' or '''M.Acy.'''), alternatively '''Master of Science in Accountancy''' ('''M.S.Acy.''') or '''Master of Professional Accountancy''' ('''M.P.Acy.''') is a graduate [[professional degree]] designed to prepare students for public accounting and to provide them with the 150 credit hours of classroom, but mostly clinical hours, required by most states before taking the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]]. 

Similar graduate programs exist in [[Canada]], where certain [[universities in Canada|universities]] such as [[University of Waterloo]]'s [[University of Waterloo School of Accounting and Finance|School of Accounting and Finance]], or [[Carleton University]]'s [[Sprott School of Business]], offer the MAcc and waive all education requirements up until the [[Uniform Evaluation|Common Final Examination]] (CFE) in order to become a [[Chartered Professional Accountant|Canadian CPA]]. 

A Master of Professional Accounting can also be obtained from [[Australia|Australian]] universities to qualify for the [[CPA Australia|Australian CPA]], [[Institute of Public Accountants|IPA]] or [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia|CA]].

This specialty program usually runs one to two years in length and contains from ten to twelve three semester credit courses (30 to 36 semester hours total). The program may consist of all graduate accounting courses or a combination of graduate accounting courses, graduate management, tax, leadership and other graduate business electives. The program is designed to not only prepare students for the CPA examination but also to provide a strong knowledge of accounting principles and business applications. 

Graduates entering corporate accounting or [[consulting firm|consulting]] often additionally (alternatively) pursue the [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA), [[Certified Internal Auditor]] (CIA) or other certifications.  

Note that in other countries, the degree's purpose may differ.  Where the [[Bachelor of Accountancy]] is the prerequisite for professional practice, for example in [[South Africa]], the Master of Accountancy then comprises specialized [[coursework]] in a [[Accounting#Topics|specific area of accountancy]] ([[Computer-aided audit tools|computer auditing]], taxation...), as opposed to CPA preparation as above. It may also be offered as a research based program,&lt;ref&gt; For example: [http://econ.ufs.ac.za/content.aspx?id=176 Free State University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129153153/http://econ.ufs.ac.za/content.aspx?id=176 |date=2014-11-29 }}, [http://academic.sun.ac.za/accounting/prospective.html Stellenbosch University], [http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualificationsMD/index.asp?link=http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualificationsMD/qualifications/98656.html UNISA] .&lt;/ref&gt; granting access to doctoral programs.

'''Nada Nadim Prouty, née Al-Aouar''' (born c. 1970) is an American former intelligence professional of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent who worked in counter-terrorism with the FBI and CIA. She worked on high-profile cases like the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] and was stationed in Baghdad during the [[Iraq War]]. She resigned after a government investigation into her brother-in-law, [[Talal Khalil Chahin]], allegedly led to the discovery of her having committed immigration-related marriage fraud.  Prouty claims she disclosed the sham marriage to the FBI when she applied, and the FBI has not denied this claim, stating simply the FBI "never condoned" the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashenfelter|first=David|title=Staff Writer|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20111107/NEWS06/311070004|work=Detroit Free Press|publisher=Gannet Company|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born into the [[Druze]] faith,&lt;ref name="Prouty 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prouty|first=Nada|title=Uncompromised: The Rise, Fall, and Redemption of an Arab American Patriot in the CIA|year=2011|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-230-34124-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLkzcCbcxbMC&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=nada+prouty+arranged+marriage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3IKhFn-WV7&amp;sig=Jm4tpjAvEp_vTZbX957HM75npMk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CAq6Tt3LHeewiQKq3MD3BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is often mistaken for being a sect of Islam. Later in life, she converted to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="Prouty 2011"/&gt;

== Biography ==

She grew up in Lebanon. When she was 19 she fled the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and her father's plans to put her in an arranged marriage. She came to the United States on a student visa (the American University in Lebanon had closed) and attended the [[Detroit College of Business]]. She entered into a fraudulent marriage to a US citizen to be able to afford her tuition and to stay in the US and not go back to Lebanon.&lt;ref name="60 Minutes"/&gt; Her sister also came to the US. Prouty got an accounting degree and joined the FBI on the advice of a professor.&lt;ref name=frogs1/&gt;

In the FBI she was a Special Agent on an international terrorism squad. She worked on the [[USS Cole bombing]] case, the [[Khobar Towers bombing]] case, the [[Laurence Foley]] case, and other terrorism cases. In about 2003 she joined the CIA. She thought the CIA would allow her cultural background and linguistic abilities to be used more effectively in her work. She felt that in the FBI, linguists were treated as "second class citizens".&lt;ref name="frogs1"/&gt;

She worked for the CIA in Baghdad, trying to prevent terrorist attacks in the wake of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. She had believed [[Colin Powell]]'s presentation about Iraqi WMDs, and that Iraq had connections to al-Qaeda. She later described herself as having felt "fooled" by the authorities when it was discovered there were no WMDs. Despite this, she felt obligated to stay in her job and help save lives.&lt;ref name="frogs1"/&gt;

On May 13, 2008, the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division entered an order revoking Prouty's naturalization as a result of her conviction for Naturalization Fraud in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1425(a).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1156.pdf |title=Order revoking United States citizenship |publisher=InvestigativeProject.org |date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 2008, the U.S. District Court entered an Order of Removal (deportation) and a concurrent grant of the Withholding of Removal to Lebanon, both pursuant to United States Code, Section 1228(c).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1157.pdf |title=Judicial order of removal to Lebanon and concurrent grant of withholding of removal to Lebanon |publisher=InvestigativeProject.org |date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-November 2011, Prouty again became a legal resident alien of the US after some of the top officials in the government intervened and signed off on the change of status. She stated that she has now applied for full citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pelley |first=Scott |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57324673/ex-cia-officers-story-takes-dramatic-turn/ |title=Ex-CIA officer's story takes dramatic turn |publisher=CBS News |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==

Her brother-in-law was [[Talal Khalil Chahin]], owner of the [[La Shish]] restaurants in Michigan. Chahin was later investigated for numerous alleged activities including tax evasion, bribery, extortion, and associating with Sheikh [[Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah]]. In 2007 Chahin was a fugitive living in Lebanon.&lt;ref name=gov1/&gt;

Eventually the investigations of Chahin led some people in the DOJ to investigate Prouty. The government interviewed her and implied that she had accessed information about [[Hezbollah]] and her relatives on the FBI's computer systems, which the DOJ argued was a misdemeanor violation of the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]].&lt;ref name=gov1/&gt; She called the idea that she had used the system to look up information on Hezbollah or her relatives "absolutely false and absurd". US officials later said that there was no evidence that Prouty had improperly disclosed any information to anyone.&lt;ref name="60 Minutes"/&gt; There was also no evidence that she passed secrets to Hezbollah or to other groups the United States considers terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 14, 2007|title=Ex-FBI Employee's Case Raises New Security Concerns|work=[[Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/13/AR2007111302033.html|accessdate=2010-03-28|author1=Joby Warrick|author2=Dan Eggen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the investigation allegedly uncovered that Prouty, her sister and a female friend had all committed immigration fraud in 1989, when she was 19 years old, by paying a man to marry her so she could obtain United States citizenship.  Prouty claims she disclosed the sham marriage on her application to the FBI and that the FBI could not have been unaware of the marriage, given the extensive background investigations required by her FBI duties. She voluntarily waived the 10-year [[statute of limitations]] on [[Illegal immigration|immigration fraud]], and, in 2007, plead guilty to two felonies related to the sham marriage and to one misdemeanor count of unauthorized use of a [[FBI]] computer.&lt;ref name="60 Minutes"/&gt; The tactics allegedly used against her to force a plea deal included freezing of bank accounts, threatening family members, threatening to go after her husband, threatening her with deportation, threatening to charge her with dozens of felonies, and threatening to publicly reveal her identity as an FBI and CIA agent. She also described that if she was deported to Lebanon, it would be a "death sentence" and she feared torture or murder by groups there. She had a young child to care for, and her decision to plea was heavily influenced by her position as a mother. She was also influenced by the high costs of putting up a legal defense. She was given no jail time, although her plea agreement left that option open for the judge in her case.&lt;ref name="60 Minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref name=frogs1/&gt;

The structure of the plea required the judge to revoke her United States citizenship, but she was granted withholding of deportation/removal by a judge on account of the perceived threat to her life and safety in her native country for her activities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20100328/NEWS01/100328023/Ex-FBI-agent-Nada-Prouty-fights-to-restore-reputation "Ex-FBI agent Nada Prouty fights to restore reputation"] by David Ashenfelter for [[freep.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/26/60minutes/main6335794_page4.shtml |title=The Case Against Nada Prouty |publisher=CBS News |date=June 6, 2010 |accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Attorney who prosecuted her was promoted to the position of a Federal Judge in Michigan.&lt;ref name=frogs1/&gt;

==Portrayal in media==
Some writers who consider themselves conservative, such as [[Debbie Schlussel]], have been highly critical of Prouty.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of Schlussel's statements, see her website, for example, this [http://www.debbieschlussel.com/19840/the-documents-dont-lie-the-hezbo-spys-lawyers-60-mins-v-me/ 2010 post]&lt;/ref&gt; Schlussel's ''[[New York Post]]'' article on Prouty used the [[moniker]] "Jihad Jane",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/item_8i33vmItH9VgeSWowxTnWJ|title=Jihad Jane's Poison Family|publisher=''New York Post''|date=November 20, 2007|first=Debbie|last=Schlussel}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other people have also been associated with that title, such as [[Colleen LaRose]].&lt;ref&gt;LaRose later adopted "JihadJane" as her [[YouTube]] [[User (computing)|screen name]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''60 Minutes'' story on Prouty was more sympathetic. They interviewed her and asked "Was a traitor exposed? Or did America lose a patriot?"&lt;ref name="60 Minutes"/&gt;

She wrote a book, ''Uncompromised'', published by Pargrave Macmillan in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.macmillan.com/uncompromised/NadaProuty Uncompromised], Nada Prouty, Pargrave Macmillan, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professional sports''', as opposed to [[amateur sports]], are [[sport|sports]] in which [[athlete|athletes]] receive [[payment]] for their performance.  Professional athleticism has come to the fore through a combination of developments. [[Mass media]] and increased [[leisure]] have brought larger audiences, so that sports organizations or teams can command large incomes.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt; As a result, more [[athlete|sportspeople]] can afford to make athleticism their primary career, devoting the training time necessary to increase skills, physical condition, and experience to modern levels of achievement.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt;  This proficiency has also helped boost the popularity of sports.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"&gt;Andy Miah ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050801000000*/https://www.media.paisley.ac.uk/andymiah/Miah1998ExtremeSpectacle.pdf Sport &amp; the Extreme Spectacle: Technological Dependence and Human Limits]'' (PDF) Unpublished manuscript, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Most sports played professionally also have amateur players far outnumbering the professionals.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

===Baseball===
[[Baseball]] originated before the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). A humble game played on sandlots in particular, scoring and record-keeping gave baseball gravity. "Today," notes John Thorn in The Baseball Encyclopedia, "baseball without records is inconceivable."

In 1871 the first professional baseball league was created.&lt;ref name="Baseball in America" /&gt; By the beginning of the 20th century, most large cities in the eastern United States had a professional baseball team. The teams were divided into two leagues, the National and American leagues. During the regular season, a team played only against other teams within its league. The most victorious team in each league was said to have won the "pennant;" the two pennant winners met after the end of the regular season in the World Series. The winner of at least four games (out of a possible seven) was the champion for that year. This arrangement still holds today, although the leagues are now subdivided and pennants are decided in post-season playoff series between the winners of each division.&lt;ref name="Baseball in America"&gt;{{cite web |title= Baseball in America: A History |publisher= The U.S. Department of State via factmonster.com |accessdate= 14 December 2014 |url= http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0875086.html |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141217101150/http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0875086.html |archivedate= 17 December 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball became popular in the 1920s, when [[Babe Ruth]] led the [[New York Yankees]] to several [[World Series]] titles and became a national hero on the strength of his [[home run]]s (balls that cannot be played because they have been hit out of the field). One of the most noteworthy players was the Brooklyn Dodgers' [[Jackie Robinson]], who became the first African-American player in the major leagues in 1947. Prior to Robinson, black players [[Baseball color line|had been restricted]] to the [[Negro Leagues]].&lt;ref name="Baseball in America" /&gt;

Starting in the 1950s, major league baseball expanded its geographical range. Western cities got teams, either by luring them to move from eastern cities or by forming expansion teams with players made available by established teams. Until the 1970s, because of strict contracts, the owners of baseball teams also virtually owned the players; since then, the rules have changed so that players can become [[free agent]]s, within certain limits, to sell their services to any team. The results have been bidding wars and stars who are paid millions of dollars a year. Disputes between the players' union and the owners have at times halted baseball for months at a time.&lt;ref name="Baseball in America" /&gt;

Japan has also seen a prominent professional baseball circuit develop known as [[Nippon Professional Baseball]], which was founded in 1934 and emerged as an international force after World War II. NPB is considered to be the highest caliber of baseball outside the U.S. major leagues, and the best Japanese talent can emigrate to the U.S. by way of the [[posting system]]. Other prominent countries to play the game include South Korea (where their league has [[Posting system (KBO)|its own posting system]] with Major League Baseball), Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean states.

===American football===

The game of American football was professionalized in the 1890s as a slow, and initially covert, process; [[William Heffelfinger]] and [[Ben "Sport" Donnelly]] were the first to secretly accept payment for playing the game in 1892.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Regional leagues in Chicago, [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit|Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio League|Ohio]] and [[New York Pro Football League|New York]] had coalesced in the 1900s and 1910s, most of which gave way to the first truly national football league, the [[National Football League|American Professional Football Association]], in 1920.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} By 1920, pro football remained overshadowed by the college game. The first game involving an APFA team took place on September 26, 1920, at Douglas Park in Rock Island, Illinois, as the hometown Independents flattened the St. Paul Ideals 48-0. The first head-to-head battles in the league occurred one week later as Dayton topped Columbus 14-0 and Rock Island pasted Muncie 45-0.

Forward passes were rare, coaching from the sidelines was prohibited and players competed on both offense and defense. Money was so tight that Hals carried equipment, wrote press releases, sold tickets, taped ankles, played and coached for the Decatur club. As opposed to today’s standard 16-game schedule, clubs in 1920 scheduled their own opponents and could play non league and even college squads that counted toward their records. With no established guidelines, the number of games played—and the quality of opponents scheduled—by APFA teams varied, and the league did not maintain official standings.&lt;ref&gt;
"The Birth of the National Football League." History.com. A&amp;E Television Networks, 14 December 2014. Web. December 15, 2014. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170528/http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buffalo All-Americans, Chicago Tigers, Columbus Panhandles and Detroit Heralds joined the league before the end of the season, raising the total number of teams to 14, but the inaugural season was a struggle. Games received little attention from the fans—and even less from the press. According to Robert W. Peterson’s book "Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football," APFA games averaged crowds of 4,241. The association bylaws called for teams to pay a $100 entry fee, but no one ever did. Muncie played only one game before dropping out before the end of the season, which concluded on December 19.

At the conclusion of the season there were no playoffs (that innovation, although New York's regional league had used it, would not arrive until 1933) and it took more than four months before the league even bothered to crown a champion. Much as college football did for decades, the APFA determined its victor by ballot. On April 30, 1921, team representatives voted the Akron Pros, who completed the season undefeated with eight wins and three ties while yielding only a total of seven points, the champion in spite of protests by the one-loss teams in Decatur and Buffalo, who each had tied Akron and had more wins. The victors received a silver loving cup donated by sporting goods company Brunswick-Balke-Collender. While players were not given diamond-encrusted rings, they did receive golden fobs in the shape of a football inscribed with the words "World Champions."

Forgotten in the collective sports memory that the league’s official record books listed the 1920 championship as undecided until the 2013. The whereabouts of the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Cup, only given out that one time, are unknown. The legacy of two APFA franchises continues on, however. The Racine Cardinals now play in Arizona, and the Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago in 1921 and changed their name to the Bears the following year. Ten APFA players along with Carr are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which opened its doors in 1963 not far from the Canton automobile dealership that gave birth to the NFL in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170528/http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}
"The Birth of the National Football League." History.com. A&amp;E Television Networks, December 14, 2014. Web. 15 December 2014. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170528/http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The APFA, by 1922 known as the [[National Football League]], has remained the predominant professional football league in the United States, and, effectively, the entire world. The evolution from a haphazard collection of teams in big and small cities to the much more rigid structure it is in the present was gradual; the smaller markets were squeezed out in the late 1920s and early 1930s, a [[NFL Championship Game|championship game]] was established in 1933, a [[NFL Draft|draft]] was established in 1936, and schedules were standardized in the 1930s. A competing league has historically arisen to attempt to challenge the NFL's dominance every 10 to 15 years, but none managed to maintain long-term operations independent of the NFL and only two—the [[All-America Football Conference]] of the late 1940s and the [[American Football League]] of the 1960s—were strong enough to successfully compete against the league before the NFL subsumed their operations. [[Minor league]] football, although their leagues' memberships were unstable, began to arise in the late 1930s and remained viable as a business model up into the 1970s.

A major factor in the NFL's rise to dominance was its [[National Football League on television|embrace of television]] early in the sport's history. As college football heavily restricted the rights of its teams to broadcast games (a policy eventually [[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma|ruled to be illegal]] in 1984), the NFL instead allowed games to be televised nationwide, [[National Football League television blackout policies|except in a team's home city]]; the restriction was softened in the early 1970s, by which point the NFL had secured broadcast deals with all of the [[Big Three television networks|major television networks]], another major factor in the inability of any competing league to gain traction since then.

The related sport of [[Canadian football]] was eventually professionalized by the 1950s, which saw the evolution of the [[Canadian Football League]]. The CFL, despite losing all games in a series of contests against the NFL, was considered to be at least comparable in talent to the American leagues of the 1960s (its lone game against an AFL squad was a victory). Because Canada has a tenth of the population of the United States, the ability to make money from television was much lower, and although some of the cities of Canada were comparable to the major markets of the U.S., teams in places such as Saskatchewan and Hamilton were in markets quite small compared to even the small markets of the NFL, thus the CFL now pays noticeably less than other major professional leagues, but still more than enough to be considered fully professional.

The rise of [[indoor American football]] beginning in the late 1980s has allowed for smaller-scale professional football to be viable.

===Ice hockey===
{{main|Professional ice hockey}}

[[Ice hockey]] was first professionalized in [[Pittsburgh]] in the early 1900s (decade). As Canadians made up the vast majority of hockey players, early American professional leagues imported almost all of their talent before Canadian leagues began to form in the wake of a mining boom, depriving the U.S. leagues and teams of talent. Two distinct circuits formed: the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] in western Canada and the northwestern U.S., and the [[National Hockey Association]] of central Canada, both of which competed for the then-independent [[Stanley Cup]]. The NHA's teams reorganized as the [[National Hockey League]] in 1917, and the West Coast circuit died out by the mid-1920s.

By 1926, the NHL expanded to 10 teams in Canada, and in the northeastern and midwestern United States. However, the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1930s, combined with Canada's entry into World War II (which greatly reduced the league's player pool), led to the league’s retrenchment to six markets: Boston, New York City, Chicago and Detroit in the U.S., and Toronto and Montreal in Canada. These [[Original Six]] cities would be the only cities with NHL franchises from 1935 to 1967. During this time, the NHL was both stagnant and restrictive in its policies, giving teams territorial advantages, having teams with multiple owners in the same family (thus allowing the best players to be stacked onto certain teams), and restricting its players' salaries through [[reserve clause]]s. This stagnation allowed other leagues to arise: the [[Western Hockey League (1952–74)|Western Hockey League]] soon became the ''de facto'' major league of the western states and provinces, and the second-tier [[American Hockey League]] emerged in a number of midwestern markets the NHL had neglected, in addition to a handful of small towns.

Amid pressure from television networks that were threatening to offer the WHL a contract, the NHL [[1967 NHL expansion|doubled in size in 1967]], beginning a period of expansion that lasted through much of the 1970s. The last major challenger to the NHL's dominance was the [[World Hockey Association]], which successfully broke the NHL's reserve clause in court, drove up professional hockey salaries, and continued to pressure the older league into expansion. The WHA merged four of its remaining teams into the NHL in 1979, but had to give up most of its players, as they were still under NHL contract and had to return to their original teams. The NHL made its last pronounced realignment in the 1990s, moving most of the WHA teams out of their markets and establishing a number of new teams in the southern United States.

In Europe, the introduction of professionalism varied widely, and the highest-caliber league on the continent, the [[Soviet Championship League]] (proven to be at least equal to or better than the NHL in the 1970s), was officially composed of [[semi-professional]] [[works team]]s paid for their association with industries or government agencies (the [[HC CSKA Moscow|Red Army squad]] employed members of the armed forces, and the Soviet Union often drafted the best hockey players in the country to serve on the squad). The modern-day descendant of the Soviet league, the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], is fully professional and has a number of teams outside Russia, to the point where it has the resources to sign NHL veterans. Other European countries such as Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Finland, and Austria also have prominent professional leagues.

===Basketball===

{{see also|List of basketball leagues}}
[[Basketball]] was invented in 1891 and the first professional leagues emerged in the 1920s. The [[Basketball Association of America]] was established in 1946 and three years later became the modern [[National Basketball Association]]. The NBA was slower to establish dominance of the sport than other sports in the United States, as it would not do so until 1976, when it absorbed four teams from the [[American Basketball Association]].

Professional basketball has the advantages of much smaller rosters than other professional sports, allowing the sport to be viable in smaller cities than other sports. Professional basketball leagues of varying caliber can be found around the world, especially in Europe and South America.

===Resistance to professionalism===
Professional athleticism is seen as a contradiction of the central ethos of [[sport]], [[competition]] performed for its own sake and pure enjoyment, rather than as a means of earning a living.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt; Consequently, many organisations and commentators have resisted the growth of professional athleticism, saying that it was so incredible that it has impeded the development of sport. For example, [[rugby union]] was for many years a part-time sport engaged in by amateurs, and English [[cricket]] has allegedly suffered in quality because of a "non-professional" approach.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt; An important reason why professional sports has been resisted in history was that organisations for professional sports usually did not submit to the international sports federations, and could have their own rules.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} For example, the [[National Basketball Association]] was formerly not a member of the [[FIBA]].

On the other hand, amateur rules heavily favour those countries where all elite players are de facto professionals but are able to retain their amateur status by earning allowances instead of salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coubertin.org/docs/Winter%20Games%20Schantz.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919124001/http://coubertin.org/docs/Winter%20Games%20Schantz.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all [[Eastern bloc]] countries were populated with amateur players who were actually full-time athletes hired as regular workers of a company ([[Krylya Sovetov Moscow|aircraft industry]], [[HC Spartak Moscow|food workers]], [[Traktor Chelyabinsk|tractor industry]]) or organization ([[HC Dynamo Moscow|KGB]], [[HC CSKA Moscow|Red Army]], [[VVS Moscow|Soviet Air Force]]) that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours [[sports club|social sports society]] [[works team|team for their workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html|title=PROTESTING AMATEUR RULES, CANADA LEAVES INTERNATIONAL HOCKEY|author=IIHF|date=2008|publisher=IIHF.com|accessdate=2017-08-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010205021/http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;59&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the growth in income for sports and athletes has come from [[Broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting rights]]; for example, the most recent [[NFL on television|television contract for the NFL]] is valued at nearly [[United States dollar|US$]]5 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL renews television deals |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7353238/nfl-re-ups-tv-pacts-expand-thursday-schedule |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215163439/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7353238/nfl-re-ups-tv-pacts-expand-thursday-schedule |archivedate=15 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the U.S., on the other hand, make much less, for example as of 2014, the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] enforced a maximum salary of US$107,000 for star players (coaches could earn double that).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diana Taurasi's decision to sit out should spark WNBA salary changes|author=Fagan, Kate|date=Feb 4, 2015|publisher=ESPN|url=http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/12272036/diana-taurasi-decision-sit-spark-wnba-salary-changes|accessdate=November 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107155126/http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/12272036/diana-taurasi-decision-sit-spark-wnba-salary-changes|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely driven by the fact that the American viewing audience has far less interest in women's professional sport compared to men's; average in-person attendance and television viewership are both far higher for the NBA compared to the WNBA. According to investopedia.com, a male star like [[Kobe Bryant]] or [[LeBron James]] can individually earn a salary larger than every player in the WNBA combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/sports-active-lifestyle/highest-paid-wnba-player-bcaf4e2c1e892b3d#|title=Who is the highest paid WNBA player?|publisher=Reference.com|accessdate=November 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107013612/https://www.reference.com/sports-active-lifestyle/highest-paid-wnba-player-bcaf4e2c1e892b3d|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the highest leagues, however, the money professional athletes can earn drops dramatically, as fan bases are generally smaller and television revenues are nonexistent. For instance, while the [[National Football League]]'s teams can afford to pay their players millions of dollars each year and still maintain a significant profit, the second-highest American football league in the United States, the [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]], consistently struggled to pay its bills and has continually lost money despite allotting its players only US$20,000 a year, and television networks made the league [[brokered programming|pay for television airtime]] instead of paying the league, making the league's business model unworkable.&lt;ref name=VirginianPilot10032012&gt;[http://hamptonroads.com/2012/10/agent-three-ufl-players-havent-been-paid-yet "Agent: Three UFL players haven't been paid yet,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163210/http://hamptonroads.com/2012/10/agent-three-ufl-players-havent-been-paid-yet |date=29 July 2013 }} from ''The Virginian-Pilot'', 10 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Joe (10 October 2012).

Retrieved 2011-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Canada, most lower-end professional leagues run themselves as affiliated [[farm team]]s, effectively agreeing to develop younger players for eventual play in the major leagues in exchange for subsidizing those players' salaries; this is known as the [[minor league]] system and is most prevalent in [[professional baseball]] and [[professional ice hockey]]. Otherwise, the league may be required to classify itself as [[semi-professional]], in other words, able to pay their players a small sum, but not enough to cover the player's basic costs of living.

Many professional athletes [[Personal finances of professional American athletes|experience financial difficulties]] soon after retiring, due to a combination of bad investments, careless spending, and a lack of non-athletic skills. The wear and tear of a career in professional sport, can cause physical and mental side effects (such as [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], a condition that has seen a massive rise in public awareness in the 2010s) that can harm a former professional athlete's employability. In the United States, some of these problems are mitigated by the fact that the [[college sports]] system ensures most professional athletes receive a college education with no student debt, a legacy that provides them with a career path after their sports career ends.

'''Richard More O'Ferrall''' (1797 – 27 October 1880) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] politician, a high level British government official and a [[Governor of Malta]].

==Career==
Richard More O'Ferrall was born in Moyvalley, [[County Kildare]], Ireland, to the prestigious House of More O'Ferrall. He was the eldest son of [[Major (British Army)|Major]] Ambrose O'Ferrall (1752–1835) and his first wife, Anne Bagot.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20565?docPos=1 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[British House of Commons]] in 1832, and represented the Constituencies of [[County Kildare]] from 10 December 1832 to 29 July 1847, and subsequently [[Longford]] from 21 April 1851 to 7 July 1852 and Kildare again from 28 April 1859 to 11 July 1865. 

Under the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig administration]] of [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], He entered the Government as a [[Lords Commissioners of the Treasury|Lord Commissioner of the Treasury]] in 1835, and remained so until 1837.
    
On 28 September 1839, More O'Ferrall married Matilda (died 1882), the second daughter of [[Thomas Southwell, 3rd Viscount Southwell|The 3rd Viscount Southwell]], [[Order of St. Patrick|KP]].&lt;ref name=loney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowBiog.php?id=69|title=Biography of  Richard More O'Ferrall|work=pdavis.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a son, [[Ambrose More O'Ferrall|Ambrose]], and a daughter, Maria Anne. 

A week after his marriage, on 4 October 1839, More O'Ferrall was appointed to the Government as First Secretary of the [[Royal Navy]], a post he retained until June 1841, when he briefly became Secretary to the Treasury. In October 1847 he became [[Governor of Malta]].&lt;ref name=loney/&gt; On 12 September 1851 More O'Ferrall resigned as governor, refusing to serve under [[Lord John Russell]], whose [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act]] was designed to prevent a restoration of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in England.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Death==
More O'Ferrall died in 1880	in [[Dún Laoghaire|Kingstown]] (present-day Dún Laoghaire), [[County Dublin]].

{{nihongo|'''Sakamoto Ryōma'''|[[:ja:坂本龍馬|坂本 龍馬]]||January 3, 1836 – December 10, 1867}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] prominent figure in the movement to overthrow the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. He was active for most of the [[Bakumatsu]]. 

One of his most noted accomplishments during this period was the negotiation of peace between [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]] (present day [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]]) and [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] (present day [[Kagoshima Prefecture]]), two powerful provinces that had long been hostile to each other. He then united them against the [[Bakufu]], the government of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] ''[[shōgun]]''.

Ryōma frequently used the alias {{nihongo|'''Saitani Umetarō'''|才谷梅太郎|}} during this period, as he was often hunted by the Bakufu supporters, such as members of the [[Shinsengumi]]. He was ultimately attacked and murdered before the [[Boshin War]], along with his companion [[Nakaoka Shintarō]], at an inn in [[Kyoto]].

== Early life ==
Ryōma was born in [[Kōchi, Kōchi|Kōchi]], of [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]] [[Han system|han]] (present day [[Kōchi Prefecture]]), on the island of [[Shikoku]]. By the [[Japanese calendar]], he was born on the 15th day of the 11th month, of the sixth year of ''[[Tenpō]]''. Previous generations of his family had acquired enough wealth as ''[[sake]]'' brewers to purchase the rank of country ''[[samurai]]'', or {{illm|Gōshi|ja|ja:郷士|dt=''gōshi''}}, which was the lowest rank in the ''samurai'' hierarchy. Unlike other domains, Tosa had a strictly-enforced separation between joshi (high-ranked samurai) and kashi (low-ranked samurai). Joshi and kashi were treated unequally and residential areas were segregated; even in Sakamoto Ryōma's generation (the third in the Sakamoto family), his family's samurai rank remained kashi. At the age of twelve, Ryōma was enrolled in a private school, but this was a brief episode in his life, as he showed little scholarly inclination.

His older sister subsequently enrolled him in fencing classes of the Oguri-ryū when he was 14, after he was bullied at school. By the time he reached adulthood he was by all accounts a master swordsman. In 1853 he was allowed by his clan to travel to [[Edo]] to train and polish his skills as a swordsman. There he enrolled as a student at the famous [[Hokushin Ittō-ryū]] Hyōhō [[Hokushin Ittō-ryū|Chiba-Dōjō]], which was led by its first Headmaster Chiba Sadakichi Masamichi at that time. He received the scroll from the school that declared his mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Kyodo, Staff Report, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/09/national/history/sakamoto-swordsmanship-scroll-declared-authentic/ Sakamoto swordsmanship scroll declared authentic]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', Nov 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He became a shihan at the [[Hokushin Ittō-ryū|Chiba-Dōjō]] and taught [[Kenjutsu]] to the students together with Chiba Jūtarō Kazutane, in whom he found a close friend. That year, Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] of the [[United States]] arrived with a fleet of ships to force Japan out of its centuries-old [[sakoku|national isolation policy]].

==Politics==
When Ryōma completed his studies in 1858, he returned to Tosa. In 1862, his friend, [[Takechi Hanpeita]] (or Takechi Zuizan), organized the Tosa Loyalist Party "Kinnoto". Their political slogan was, "[[Sonnō jōi|Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians]]". It consisted of about 2000 samurai, mostly from the lower rank, who insisted on the reform of the Tosa government. Since the Tosa lord refused to recognize the group, they plotted to assassinate Yoshida Toyo (who was later assassinated, but after Ryōma had left Tosa). Ryōma participated in the plot but did not advocate it; Takechi demanded a revolution for only the Tosa clan, and Ryōma thought they should do something for all of Japan. He decided to leave Tosa and separate from Takechi. In those days, no one was permitted to leave their clan without permission, on penalty of death. One of Ryōma's sisters committed suicide because he left without permission. Sakamoto would later use the alias "Saitani Umetarō" (才谷 梅太郎) as he worked against the shogun.&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100427i1.html Sakamoto, the man and the myth]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', April 27, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned under this alias in the diary of [[Ernest Satow]] for 30 September 1867: "Mr. Saedani had to be sat up for laughing at the questions put by us, evidently with the object of ridiculing us out of our case, but he got a flea in his lug and shut up making the most diabolical faces."&lt;ref&gt;R. Morton &amp; I. Ruxton, eds., ''The Diaries of Sir Ernest Mason Satow, 1861–69,'' Kyoto: Eureka Press, 2013, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bakumatsu period ==
While a ''rōnin'', Ryōma decided to assassinate [[Katsu Kaishū]], a high-ranking official in the Tokugawa shogunate and a supporter of both modernization and westernization. However, Katsu Kaishū persuaded Ryōma of the necessity of a long-term plan to increase Japan's military strength. Instead of killing Katsu Kaishū, Ryōma started working as his assistant and protégé.

In 1864, as the Tokugawa shogunate began taking a hard line, Ryōma fled to [[Kagoshima]] in [[Satsuma Domain]], which was developing as a major centre for the anti-Tokugawa movement. Ryōma negotiated the secret [[Satchō Alliance|alliance]] between [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]] and [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] provinces. Satsuma and Chōshū historically had been irreconcilable enemies, and Ryōma's position as a "neutral outsider" was critical in bridging the gap in trust.

Ryōma is often regarded as the "father of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]", as he worked under [[Katsu Kaishū]]'s direction toward creating a modern naval force (with the aid of western powers) to enable Satsuma and Chōshū to hold their own against the naval forces of the Tokugawa shogunate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}&lt;!--Isn't Katsu Kaishu considered the father of the IJN?--&gt; Ryōma founded the private navy and trading company [[kaientai|Kameyama Shachū]] in Nagasaki City with the help of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]]. Later Kameyama Shachū became [[Kaientai]] or Ocean Support Fleet.

Chōshū's subsequent victory over the Tokugawa army in 1866 and the impending collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate made Ryōma a valuable commodity to his former masters in Tosa. Ryōma was recalled to Kōchi with honours. The Tosa domain was anxious to obtain a negotiated settlement between the Shogun and the Emperor, which would prevent the powerful Satchō Alliance from overthrowing the Tokugawa by force and thus emerging as a new dominant force in ruling Japan. Ryōma again played a crucial role in the subsequent negotiations that led to the voluntary resignation of the Shogun [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] in 1867, thus bringing about the [[Meiji Restoration]].

Ryōma was an admirer of democratic principles. Ryōma began studying democratic governance, particularly the United States Congress and British Parliament as a model for the governance of Japan after the Restoration.  Ryōma argued that after centuries of having little political power, the Imperial Court lacked the resources and wherewithal to run the country.  Ryōma wrote the "Eight Proposals While Shipboard" (『船中八策』) while discussing the future model of Japanese government with [[Gotō Shōjirō]] on board a Tosa ship outside Nagasaki in 1867.  Ryōma outlined the need for a democratically elected bicameral legislature, the writing of a Constitution, the formation of a national army and navy, and the regulation of gold and silver exchange rates. Ryōma's proposals are thought to form the basis for the subsequent parliamentary system implemented after his death.

==Death==
Ryōma was [[assassination|assassinated]] at the age of 31 at the Ōmiya (近江屋) inn in [[Kyoto]], not long before the [[Meiji Restoration]] took place.  On the night of December 10, 1867, assassins gathered at the door of the inn and one approached and knocked, acting as an ordinary caller.  The door was answered by Ryōma's bodyguard and manservant, a former [[rikishi|sumo wrestler]] who told the stranger he would see if Ryōma was accepting callers at that hour of the evening.  When the bodyguard turned his back, the visitor at the door drew his sword and slashed his back, which became a fatal wound.  The team of assassins rushed over and passed the dying sumo wrestler and up the stairs to the guests' rooms.  Ryōma and [[Nakaoka Shintarō]] were resting in one room talking. Hearing the scuffle on the first floor, Ryōma opened the door to yell at his bodyguard, thinking he was wrestling with a friend.  The assassins charged the room, some tearing through the paper doors (''[[shōji]]''), and a confused melée ensued as lamps were knocked over and the room went dark.  By the end of the fight, both Ryōma and Shintaro lay badly wounded, and the assassins fled. Ryōma died that night, regretting with his last words that his assassins caught him unprepared. Shintaro died two days later.

The night of the assassination was eventually called the Omiya Incident.  According to the traditional lunar calendar, Ryōma was born on the 15th day of the 11th month, and killed on his birthday in 1867. Initial reports accused members of the [[Shinsengumi]] for Ryōma's and Shintarō's deaths, and Shinsengumi leader [[Kondō Isami]] was later executed on this charge.  However, members of another pro-''[[shōgun]]'' group, the [[Kyoto Mimawarigumi|Mimawarigumi]], confessed to the murder in 1870. Although Mimawarigumi members [[Sasaki Tadasaburō]] (佐々木 只三郎) and [[Imai Nobuo]] carry the blame, the identity of the true assassin has never been proven.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Marius, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fa20100507a1.html Crime scene investigation: Edo: Samurai Sakamoto Ryoma's murder scene makes a grisly but fascinating show]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', May 7, 2010, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryōma was a visionary who dreamt of an independent Japan without [[feudalism|feudal]] trappings. He read about the West and was inspired by the example of the [[United States]] where "[[all men are created equal]]". He realized that to compete with an industrially and technologically advanced outside world, the Japanese people needed to modernize. He has also been seen as an intriguing mix of the traditional and modern, symbolized by his preference for samurai dress while favoring western footwear.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Ryōma has been heavily featured and romanticized [[#In popular culture|in popular culture]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Honors in modern times ==
On 15 November 2003, the Kōchi Airport was renamed the [[Kōchi Airport|Kōchi Ryōma Airport]] in his honor.

There is a [[Sakamoto Ryōma Memorial Museum]] (坂本龍馬記念館) south of Kōchi, with a large bronze statue of Ryoma overlooking the sea.  The city of Kōchi has a number of Ryōma-themed attractions and locations, including the Sakamoto Ryōma Birthplace Memorial, and the Sakamoto Ryōma Hometown Museum, dedicated to showing what downtown Kōchi was like during Ryōma's childhood, including relevant aspects that may have influenced his views.  On 15 November 2009, the Hokkaidō Sakamoto Ryōma Memorial Museum was built in [[Hakodate, Hokkaido]].

Asteroid [[2835 Ryoma]] is named after him. Asteroid 5823 Oryo is named after his wife.

An April 2010 ''[[Japan Times]]'' article wrote "Ryōma has inspired at least seven television drama series, six novels, seven manga and five films."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0032310/&lt;/ref&gt; His appeal stems from being "the kind of person onto whom anyone can project themselves", as actor [[Masaharu Fukuyama]] described his role playing him in the [[NHK]] drama ''[[Ryōmaden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corkill |first=Edan |title=Legendary, dirty samurai gets makeover |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20091225r1.html |date=January 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 3, 2010 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sakomota Ryoma is a principle character in the manga and subsequent 2009 TBS series [[Jin (TV series)]]. He was portrayed by [[Seiyō Uchino]].

Sakamoto is a recurring character in the [[NHK]] ''[[Taiga Drama]]: [[Shinsengumi!]]''.  He is portrayed as a friend of [[Kondō Isami]] since their younger days.  In the drama he is assassinated by [[Sasaki Tadasaburō]] and the [[Mimawarigumi]].  In ''[[Ryu_ga_Gotoku_Ishin!|Ryū Ga Gotoku Ishin!]]'', the second samurai-themed spinoff to the [[Yakuza (series)|''Yakuza'' series]], Sakamoto Ryōma is the main protagonist played by Takaya Kuroda, and is modeled after series protagonist [[Kazuma Kiryu]].

Sakamoto appears in the historical manga ''[[Shura no Toki]]'', which was later adapted into the anime, ''[[Mutsuen Meiryū Gaiden: Shura no Toki]]''. In addition, he also makes appearances, with varying levels of historical accuracy, in numerous other manga, anime, and video games.

[[GReeeeN]] wrote a song about what Sakamoto would be like in the modern world, named [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEyhXz1O8XE "SAKAMOTO"].

Sakamoto appears in the mobile game ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'', as a Rider-class Servant and ally during the third Gudaguda event.

In [[NHK]]'s [[Taiga Drama]] ''[[Segodon]]'', Sakamoto Ryōma is portrayed by actor [[Shun Oguri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetv.jp/news/detail/154685/|title=＜西郷どん＞小栗旬の“龍馬”登場に女子騒然！「“男くささ”がたまらない!!」|last=|first=|date=July 16, 2018|website=thetv.jp|language=Japanese|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Trade and Investment Framework Agreement''' ('''TIFA''') is a [[trade pact]] that establishes a framework for expanding trade and resolving outstanding disputes between [[country|countries]].

TIFAs are often seen as an important step towards establishing [[Free Trade Agreement]]s.

== ASEAN ==
The [[United States]] and [[ASEAN]] concluded the U.S.-ASEAN Trade and Investment Arrangement (TIFA) in 2006 and since then have been working to build U.S.-ASEAN trade and investment ties as well as promote ASEAN regional economic integration. The United States intensified its work under the TIFA in 2009, presenting ASEAN senior officials a number of ambitious proposals to be pursued under the TIFA work plan. These proposed initiatives seek to achieve concrete results in a variety of areas including trade facilitation, logistics, [[digital economy]], trade finance, and trade and environment.
The 10-member countries of ASEAN together comprise the fourth largest export market of the United States and its fifth largest two-way trading partner. ASEAN countries include Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Trade between the U.S. and ASEAN continues to grow steadily, and two-way goods trade totaled $177 billion in 2008. With robust economies and a total population of about 550 million, the 10-member countries of the ASEAN market provide significant potential [[market opportunity|opportunities]] for U.S. companies.

== Taiwan ==
The U.S. goods [[trade deficit]] with [[Taiwan]] was $15.2 billion in 2006, an increase of $2.4 billion from $12.8 billion in 2005. U.S. goods exports in 2006 were $23.0 billion, up 4.3 percent from the previous year. Corresponding [[U.S. imports]] from Taiwan were $38.2 billion, up 9.7 percent. Taiwan is as of June 2015, the 11th largest export market for U.S. goods.
U.S. exports of private commercial services (excluding military and government) to Taiwan were $6.4 billion in 2005 (latest data available), and U.S. imports were $6.4 billion. Sales of services in Taiwan by majority U.S.-owned affiliates were $10.2 billion in 2004 (latest data available), while sales of services in the United States by majority Taiwan-owned firms were $475 million. The stock of U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Taiwan was $13.4 billion in 2005. U.S. FDI in Taiwan is concentrated largely in the finance, manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors. The United States and Taiwan continued to work together to enhance economic cooperation through bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) process. The TIFA, which was established in 1994, is an important mechanism for both parties to resolve bilateral trade issues and to address the concerns of the U.S. business community. The United States and Taiwan held a productive meeting of the fifth meeting of the TIFA Joint Council in Taipei, May 25–26, 2006, covering issues related to agricultural trade, intellectual property rights, pharmaceuticals, government procurement and investment, as well as other areas.

== Uruguay ==
The U.S.-Uruguay commercial relationship has developed significantly in the past several years. In 2002, [[Uruguay]] and the United States created a [[Joint Commission on Trade and Investment]] (JCTI) to exchange ideas on a variety of economic topics. The Commission served as an important mechanism for the two countries to work to enhance and broaden their trade relationship, and facilitated the successful negotiation of the United States - Uruguay Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), which entered into force on November 1, 2006.
The United States and Uruguay signed the United States - Uruguay TIFA on January 25, 2007. The TIFA established the United States - Uruguay Trade and Investment Council (TIC) and serves as a mechanism to further deepen the trade and investment dialogue. On October 2, 2008, both governments signed protocols to the TIFA covering substantive commitments in the areas of trade facilitation and public participation in trade and environment.
The TIFA contains an annex that established a work program calling for the two governments to address such matters as [[economic liberalization|liberalization]] of bilateral trade and investment, intellectual property rights, regulatory issues, information and communications technology and electronic commerce, trade facilitation, trade and technical capacity building, trade in services, government procurement, and cooperation on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The annex provides for the TIC to add other matters to the work program.
In implementing the TIFA, both parties reconfirmed their commitment to expand economic opportunities between Uruguay and the United States while simultaneously coordinating their efforts to promote greater [[trade liberalization]] through the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).

As an independent audit firm, Verified Audit Circulation works with publication circulation figures provided by their publisher clients, to verify or adjust these circulation numbers, based on examining a publication’s printing and financial records. Field research also may be conducted to confirm circulation figures. Circulation audit findings are compiled and released in audit reports, which advertisers use to make decisions about advertising placements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | last = Armor   | first =  Jennifer  | title =  How to Purchase Print Advertising Wisely | publisher = National Mail Order Association  |  url =  http://www.nmoa.org/articles/dmnews/Howtopurchaseprintadvertising707.htm | accessdate = 4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

During the mid-twentieth century, traditional paid-circulation newspapers and magazines were joined by a new publication category:  free-circulation newspapers and magazines, known as trade or controlled-circulation publications. As free newspapers and magazines increased in number, in 1951, Geraldine Knight founded Verified Audit Circulation as the first company dedicated to auditing these publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | title = Company History | publisher = Verified Audit Circulation| url = http://www.verifiedaudit.com/history.htm | accessdate = 3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Verified expanded its services to include audits of paid publications, free rack-distributed publications, and products delivered to the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | title = Company History | publisher = Verified Audit Circulation| url = http://www.verifiedaudit.com/history.htm | accessdate = 29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of web site audits provided site publishers with independent confirmation of site visitor activity and with assurance of web site ad delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Narendra Modi Controversy ===

In 2013, the WIEF organizers invited the Gujarat chief minister [[Narendra Modi]] to deliver the keynote address via video-conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/wharton-snub-support-grows-for-narendra-modi_832838.html | title = Wharton snub: Support grows for Narendra Modi | date = 2013-03-04 | accessdate = 2013-03-04 | publisher = Zee News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toorjo Ghose, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania  and a small group of colleagues put together a petition after learning about Wharton's invitation to Modi. Kasturi Sen,  a Philadelphia-based attorney, created a group on Facebook and initially hosted the petition there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-03-05/news/37469804_1_responsible-student-body-organisers-wharton-india-economic-forum  Narendra Modi's address at Wharton nulled via Facebook, ET Bureau, Economic Times,  Mar 5, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  The petition cited the [[India–United States relations#2005 Denial of Visa Application and Revocation of Visa|revocation of visa to Modi]] in 2005 by the US state department.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303380004579520041301275638 Why Narendra Modi Was Banned From the U.S., JAMES MANN Wall Street Journal,  May 2, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined by Ania Loomba and Suvir Kaul, both Indian-American [[University of Pennsylvania|UPenn]] professors, who were critical of Modi's handling of the [[2002 Gujarat violence|2002 Hindu-Muslim riots]], started formal a petition demanding the cancellation of the invitation, failing which they would protest his virtual presence at the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/03/petition-against-narendra-modis-invitation-to-the-wharton-india-economic-forum  Petition against Narendra Modi's invitation to the Wharton India Economic Forum, By PETITIONERS, The Daily Pennsylvanian, 03/10/13]&lt;/ref&gt;

The petition was sent to  [[Amy Gutmann]], the UPenn president. The university leadership stepped in to diffuse what it saw as a potentially explosive situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newdelhi/inside-story-why-wharton-cancelled-modi-s-lecture/article1-1021161.aspx Inside story: why Wharton cancelled Modi's lecture, Charu Sudan Kasturi, Hindustan Times  New Delhi, March 05, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
The WIEF organizers had to cancel the invitation, even though they stood by the earlier decision to invite Modi. They stated that they wanted to avoid putting Modi in a "compromising position".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-21651603 | title = India minister Narendra Modi's US speech cancelled | publisher = BBC | date = 2013-03-03 | accessdate = 2013-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the decision, the petition had been signed by around 135 people, and the number of signatories grew to 250 later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_a-petition-signed-by-about-135-people-behind-wharton-s-decision-to-cancel-narendra-modi-invite_1807248 | title = A petition signed by about 135 people behind Wharton's decision to cancel Narendra Modi invite | newspaper = DNA | date = 2013-03-04 | accessdate = 2013-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Wharton official distanced Wharton from the decision stating “Make no mistake, the move to not have Modi was a result of UPenn, not Wharton,”  pointing to the fact that not a single Wharton faculty member had signed the petition demanding cancellation of Modi's speech.

In Modi's support, the [[Shiv Sena]] leader [[Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu]] scrapped his visit to Wharton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/316390/sena-leader-prabhu-cancels-wharton.html | title = Sena leader Prabhu cancels Wharton visit after Modi snub |work= India Today |date= 2013-03-04 |accessdate= 2013-03-04 |publisher= Zee News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speaker, the Wall Street Journal writer and journalist [[Sadanand Dhume]], also pulled out from the forum in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/columnist-sadanand-dhume-opts-out-of-wharton-forum-113030500661_1.html | title = Columnist Sadanand Dhume opts out of Wharton forum | newspaper = Business Standard | date = 2013-03-05 | accessdate = 2013-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Padma Shri Awards (2010–2019)#2010|Sudhir Parikh]], a New Jersey-based eminent physician, philanthropist, publisher and [[Padma Shri]] awardee. However, Parikh too withdrew from the conference as a mark of protest. He stated, ''"The manner in which the committee has been pressurised to rescind its invitation to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on entirely suspicious grounds, I feel the intellectual integrity of the forum has been compromised."''&lt;ref name="Indian-American pulls out of WIEF"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian-American pulls out of WIEF|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/india-abroad/indian-american-pulls-out-of-wharton-india-economic-forum.html|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The Pioneer|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Somers]], also a keynote speaker, termed the decision to drop Modi as "unfortunate and disrespectful", but said that he would attend the event in order to make his point about free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/NorthAmerica/Wharton-Modi-controversy-unfortunate-and-disrespectful-USIBC/Article1-1022062.aspx | title = Wharton-Modi controversy unfortunate and disrespectful: USIBC | newspaper = Hindustan Times | date = 2013-03-04 | accessdate = 2013-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another keynote speaker [[Mohandas Pai]] also backed out complaining about mistreatment of Indians outside India; he mentioned the "shabby" treatment of Narendra Modi among other incidents such as the [[2012 Italian shooting in the Arabian Sea|Italian marines controversy]], Pakistan's reaction to [[Afzal Guru]]'s hanging and Sri Lanka's treatment of Indian fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-15/india/37743320_1_mohandas-pai-indian-fishermen-wharton-event | title = Mohandas Pai says no to Wharton | date = 2013-03-15 | accessdate = 2013-03-15 | newspaper = The Times of India | author = Mini Joseph Tejaswi }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Congressman [[Eni Faleomavaega]] expressed disappointment at the decision, criticizing the protesters as "a segment of professors and students who are reaching beyond the law and coming awfully close to violating the rights of others who have a different view".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/disappointing-that-wharton-rescinded-its-invite-to-narendra-modi-us-lawmaker-338816 'Disappointing that Wharton rescinded its invite to Narendra Modi': US lawmaker].
