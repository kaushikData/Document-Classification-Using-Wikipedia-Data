'''Absolute Category Rating''' (ACR) is a test method used in [[video quality|quality]] tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.910/en P.910 : Subjective video quality assessment methods for multimedia applications]. ''ITU-T Recommendation'', approved in 1999-09. Retrieved on 2008-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.800|title=P.800 : Methods for subjective determination of transmission quality|last=tsbmail|website=www.itu.int|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The levels of the scale are, sorted by quality in decreasing order:
* Excellent
* Good
* Fair
* Poor
* Bad

In this method, a single test condition (generally an image or a video sequence) is presented to the viewers once only. They should then give a quality rating on an ACR scale. Test conditions should be presented in a random order per test person.

The ACR scale is evaluated based on numbers that are assigned to the individual items, where ''Excellent'' equals to 5 and ''Bad'' equals to 1. The average numeric score over all experiment participants, for each test condition that was shown, is called the [[Mean Opinion Score]].

The ACR scale is also used for telephony voice quality to give a [[Mean Opinion Score]].

An '''aromachologist''' is a person who practices [[aromachology]], which is a method of using smells or [[essential oil]]s to create, either in isolation or through blending in formulations, essential oils that have behavioral, physical and emotional benefits. Smell is the least studied of the senses, but aromachology is being used increasingly in [[healthcare]] and building science, and also in the world of sports and in practical matters such as real estate sales.

While all aromachologists have a refined sense of smell, some employ other senses including sight, sound and hearing. These are [[Synesthesia|synesthetes]] and history documents famous synesthetes such as the British painter [[David Hockney]], the Russian artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]], the Hungarian composer [[Franz Liszt]] and the English poet [[William Blake]].

An aromachologist is a person who studies the effects of fragrance on human psychology and behavior and works with essential oils for their positive effects on behavior and feeling. An aromachologist is a practitioner of aromachology, which is a term coined in 1982 by the Olfactory Research Fund, now known as the [[Sense of Smell Institute]], a division of the Fragrance Foundation, which has funded numerous medical, university and individual studies on the effects of scents on sleep and performance. Aromachology differs from [[aromatherapy]].

An aromachologist is a formulator who works with essential oils for their aromatic and physical effects and is an expert in the way essential oils can be blended and articulated together to create “behavioral fragrances”&lt;ref&gt;Damian, Kate,'' Aromatherapy: Scent and Psyche'', page 120, 1995, Healing Arts Press, USA, {{ISBN|0-89281-530-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish the positive effects of aromas on human behavior including feelings and emotions.

The aims of aromachology are to “study the interrelationship of psychology and the latest in fragrance technology and to transmit through odor a variety of specific feelings (such as relaxation, exhilaration, sensuality, happiness and achievement) directly to the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Lis-Balchin, ''Aromatherapy Science: A Guide for Healthcare Professionals'', page 3, 2006, Pharmaceutical Press, Publications Division of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, {{ISBN|0-85369-578-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When odors activate the [[olfactory]] pathways that lead to the [[limbic]] portion of the brain they trigger the release of [[neurotransmitters]] that affect the brain and mental state of the individual in a variety of ways. Further, stimuli transmitted to the limbic system cannot be consciously blocked and all olfactory stimuli therefore influence our [[emotion]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Smell as a sense is the last frontier of neuroscience and has not been studied in as much depth as vision and hearing. The brain is able to process small differences in smell&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070428094824.htm "Brain Processes Sense of Smell Better Than Previously Thought"] "Science Daily", April 30, 2007, retrieved  2009-12-3&lt;/ref&gt; and the sense of smell may last longer in the aging process than sight and hearing. The olfactory bulb is that portion of the brain which processes smells information and its oscillations alter dynamically according to the tasks involved.

==Synesthesia==
There are some people who process smells differently, hearing them as sounds. Canadian aromachologist, Nadine Artemis, author and formulator for Living Libations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livinglibations.com&lt;/ref&gt; is one such [[Synesthesia|synestheste]].{{Failed verification|date=February 2010}}

When Artemis picks up a scent, she also sees colors. Therefore, when she is creating in aromachology, she is not only combining a palette of smells, she is also mixing a palette of colors to blend the purest, organic essential oils into an array of beneficial products. For example, when Artemis sniffs tainted or synthetic fragrances, she sees them as murky gray or muddy brown. Discovering this extraordinary sense of smell at a young age, Artemis sees different distillations of rose, one of the world’s most expensive essential oils, as hues and tones of pink and red. Calming chamomile comes across in hues varying from oceanic teals to deep royal blues.

==Universal synesthesia==
It is believed that we all possess a small degree of [[synesthesia]]&lt;ref&gt;Vintini, Leonardo,[https://archive.is/20130204100533/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/science-technology/synesthetic-synesthesia-patricia-duffy-dr-jamie-ward-dr-richard-cytowic-5912.html "We Could All Be a Little Synesthetic"], ''Epoch Times'', October 20, 2008, updated November 28, 2009, retrieved 2009-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; according to Dr Jamie Ward &amp;mdash; quality of intermixing images, sounds and other sensations. The Russian painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]] is believed to have employed four senses of touch, smell, color and sound.

There are many instances of literature that may have portrayed synesthesia. For example, the famous poet [[William Blake]] (1757–1827) was probably a synesthete. In his poem “Wild Flower Song”, he writes: 
:As I wander'd the forest,
:The green leaves among,
:I heard a wild flower
:Singing a song

In the book ''Perfume'' by [[Patrick Süskind]], the main character, Grenouille, is born with a hyper-acute sense of smell but lacks his own bodily scent. He goes on a life quest, including many murders, to recreate the scent of innocence he sniffed on a beautiful girl.

==Effects of aromachology==

Studies have been conducted to show that those parts of the brain which govern alertness and concentration can be influenced positively or negatively by the olfactory substances used. [[Jasmine]] in a testing room enhanced the problem-solving cognitive skills of participants and also led to them demonstrating more interest and motivation for the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Rottman"&gt;Rottman, T. R. (1989). The effects of ambient odor on the cognitive performance, mood, and activation, of low and high impulsive individuals in a naturally arousing situation. ''Diss. Abstr. Int.'' 50:365B 1989&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of [[eucalyptus]], [[peppermint oil]] and [[ethanol]] has been shown to improve cognitive performance, and after a monotonous stressful task experimental subjects were shown to demonstrate greater motivation after being exposed to a blend of peppermint, [[bergamot essential oil|bergamot]], [[sandalwood]] and [[lavender]].&lt;ref name="Rottman"/&gt;

==Role of an aromachologist==

Pleasant aromas cause people to linger longer, a boon to [[retail]] stores, museums, spas and [[casino]]s. Pleasant smells have been shown to improve productivity, and improve physical performance, with athletes running faster, doing more pushups, and experiencing shorter recovery time after an extensive workout when the room was scented with either [[peppermint]] or [[lemon]].&lt;ref&gt;Raudenbush, B., Corley, N., &amp; Eppich, W., Pages 156-160. Augmenting athletic performance through the administration of peppermint odor. ''Journal of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology'', 23,(2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

By blending specific smells, an aromachologist can create a more restful environment and improve health conditions. A study in 1987&lt;ref name="Kempski"&gt;Kempski, Diotoma von, Page 63, "The Use of Olfactory Stimulants to Improve Air Quality", ''Journal of the Human Environmental System'', Vol 5; No.2 61-68, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the smells found in [[nutmeg oil]], maize extract, neroli oil, valerian oil, myristici, soelemcin and [[elemicin]] reduce stress in humans as well as reducing stress-related high blood pressure. The Mind Lab, an independent consultancy in the UK, studies the odor of a building as part of research on the brain’s responses to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;McCooey, Christopher, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3ac8eac6-cf93-11dc-854a-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 Scenting Success], ''Financial Times'', Feb 02 2008, retrieved 2009-10-03&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate brokers have been recommending to their clients to have smells of freshly baked cookies or the aroma of coffee in the house when it is being presented to potential buyers to create a sense of home. By bottling and releasing appropriate smells to evoke comfort, safety and joy, an owner may be able to accelerate the sale of a house.

Worker productivity can be enhanced by improving the quality of air in a building, not just by removing the negative pollutants, but also by introducing through ventilation or air conditioning systems olfactory stimulation]s to get a mix of ventilated air and odor.

It is necessary to ensure that the dosage is such that the odor is not excessive and should be kept just above the detection level. Also, these olfactory substances are very different from perfume and should instead replicate the smell of natural outdoor air.&lt;ref name="Kempski"/&gt;

A skilled aromachologist can concoct combinations of oils to reduce [[road rage]], reduce fatigue and improve concentration while driving.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Peppermint decreases anxiety and fatigue while driving, and in combination with [[cinnamon]] it reduces the level of frustration encountered in traffic and also heightens alertness.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Jasmine is used as a sleep aid and the scent of [[vanilla]] is useful for those who want to cut the craving for sweets after lunch.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Linda, http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200711/the-hidden-force-fragrance?page=2, ''Psychology Today'', Nov 21 1008, Retrieved 2009-10-18&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sound measurements}}

'''Audio power''' is the [[electric power|electrical power]] transferred from an [[audio amplifier]] to a [[loudspeaker]], measured in [[watt]]s.  The [[electrical power]] delivered to the loudspeaker, together with its [[Electrical efficiency|efficiency]], determines the [[sound power]] generated (with the rest of the electrical power being converted to heat).

Amplifiers are limited in the electrical energy they can output, while loudspeakers are limited in the electrical energy they can convert to sound energy without being damaged or [[Distortion|distorting]] the audio signal.  These limits, or [[power rating]]s, are important to consumers finding compatible products and comparing competitors.

==Power handling==
In [[audio electronics]], there are several methods of measuring power output (for such things as amplifiers) and '''power handling''' capacity (for such things as loudspeakers).

=== Amplifiers ===
Amplifier output power is limited by voltage, current, and temperature:
* Voltage: The amp's [[power supply]] [[voltage]] limits the maximum amplitude of the waveform it can output.  This determines the peak momentary output power for a given load resistance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocketroberts.com/techart/powerart_a.htm|title=Understanding Power Amplifier Power Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=www.rocketroberts.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-28|quote=The peak of the signal is just touching [...] the values of the power supply rails. This signal is still clean and undistorted, however it is the maximum clean signal that is possible for this amplifier. [...] Peak Power: [...] the maximum amount of power that can be delivered to a load [...] For the amplifier we have been using in our example, the peak power (for an 8 ohm load) is 200 watts. This amount of power is delivered to the 8 ohm load at the instant when the output voltage of the amplifier is at +40 volts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meyersound.com/support/papers/amp_power.htm|title=Making Sense of Amplifier Power Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=www.meyersound.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-28|quote=Using this rail voltage, we could calculate the instantaneous peak power...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Current: The amp's output devices ([[transistor]]s or [[Vacuum tube|tubes]]) have a current limit, above which they are damaged.  This determines the minimum [[load resistance]] that the amp can drive at its maximum voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-AmplifierLoudspeakerAndOhm.htm|title=Amplifier, Loudspeaker, and Ohm|last=Sengpiel|first=Eberhard|date=|website=www.sengpielaudio.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-28|quote=If speaker impedance is too low [...] Too much current will run through the AV receiver's output transistors, causing the receiver to overheat and shut down.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Temperature: The amp's output devices waste some of the electrical energy as heat, and if it is not removed quickly enough, they will rise in temperature to the point of damage.  This determines the continuous output power.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=average%20continuous%20power%20abbreviation&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q=average%20continuous%20power%20abbreviation&amp;f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|last=Magazines|first=Hearst|date=1987-12-01|publisher=Hearst Magazines|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=The Federal Trade Commission has long been aware of this fact, and in 1975 stepped in to halt the abuses of companies that wanted you to think your amp could launch a speaker into orbit. [...] all published power specs have to state continuous power in watts [...] the average amount of power the amp is capable of producing over an extended period of time.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As an amplifier's power output strongly influences its price, there is an incentive for manufacturers to exaggerate output power specs to increase sales. Without regulations, imaginative approaches to advertising power ratings became so common that in 1975 the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] intervened in the market and required all amplifier manufacturers to use an engineering measurement (continuous average power) in addition to any other value they might cite.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Loudspeakers ===
For loudspeakers, there is also a thermal and a mechanical aspect to maximum power handling.
* Thermal: Not all energy delivered to a loudspeaker is emitted as sound. In fact, most is converted to heat, and the temperature must not rise too high. High level signals over a prolonged period can cause thermal damage, which may be immediately obvious, or  reduce longevity or performance margin. 
* Mechanical: Loudspeaker components have mechanical limits which can be exceeded by even a very brief power peak; an example is the most common sort of loudspeaker driver, which cannot move in or out more than some [[Excursion (audio)|excursion]] limit without mechanical damage.
There are no similar loudspeaker power handling regulations in the US; the problem is much harder as many loudspeaker systems have very different power handling capacities at different frequencies (e.g., tweeters which handle high frequency signals are physically small and easily damaged, while woofers which handle low frequency signals are larger and more robust).

== Power calculations ==
[[Image:Peak-power-average-power-tau-T.png|thumb|A graph of instantaneous power over time for a waveform, with peak power labeled P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and average power labeled P&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Since the [[instantaneous power]] of an [[alternating current|AC]] waveform varies over time, [[AC power]], which includes audio power, is measured as an average over time.  It is based on this formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/ACCircuit/AC-AvePower.html|title=Average Power in an AC Circuit|last=Vawter|first=Richard|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327161721/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/ACCircuit/AC-AvePower.html|archive-date=2010-03-27|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
P_\mathrm{avg} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T} v(t) \cdot i(t)\, dt \,
&lt;/math&gt;

For a purely [[resistive]] [[Electrical load|load]], a simpler equation can be used, based on the [[root mean square]] (RMS) values of the voltage and current waveforms:
:&lt;math&gt;
P_\mathrm{avg} = V_\mathrm{rms} \cdot I_\mathrm{rms} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a steady sinusoidal tone (not music) into a purely resistive load, this can be calculated from the [[peak amplitude]] of the [[voltage]] waveform (which is easier to measure with an [[oscilloscope]]) and the load's resistance:
:&lt;math&gt;
P_\mathrm{avg} = \frac{{V_\mathrm{rms}}^2}{R} = \frac{{V_\mathrm{peak}}^2}{2R} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Though a speaker is ''not'' purely resistive, these equations are often used to approximate power measurements for such a system. Approximations may be used as reference on a specification sheet of a product.

=== Example ===
An amplifier under test can drive a sinusoidal signal with a peak amplitude of 6 V (driven by a 12 V battery). When connected to an 8 [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]] loudspeaker this would deliver:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{avg} = {(6~\mathrm{V})^2 \over 2(8~\Omega)}\,\ = 2.25~\mathrm{W}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the output of an inexpensive car audio amplifier is limited by the voltage of the [[alternator (auto)|alternator]].  In most actual car systems, the amplifiers are connected in a [[bridge-tied load]] configuration, and speaker impedances are no higher than 4 Ω.  High-power car amplifiers use a DC-to-DC converter to generate a higher supply voltage.

== Measurements ==

=== Continuous power and "RMS power" {{anchor|RMS}}===
{{see also|Root mean square#Average power}}
[[File:RMS voltage average power.svg|thumb|A voltage waveform and its corresponding power waveform (resistive load).  RMS voltage in blue, peak power in red, average power in green.]]
''Continuous'' ''average [[sine wave]] power'' ratings are a staple of performance specifications for audio amplifiers and, sometimes, loudspeakers.

As described above, the term ''average power'' refers to the average value of the [[Power (physics)|instantaneous power]] waveform over time.

''Continuous'' (as opposed to "momentary") implies that the device can function at this power level for long periods of time; that heat can be removed at the same rate it is generated, without temperature building up to the point of damage.

On May 3, 1974, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) instated its Amplifier Rule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/amplifier-rule|title=Amplifier Rule 16 CFR Part 432 {{!}} Federal Trade Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ftc.gov|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-28|quote=rated minimum sine wave continuous average power output, in watts, per channel [...] at the impedance for which the amplifier is primarily designed, measured with all associated channels fully driven to rated per channel power}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=39 FR 15387|url=http://cfr.law.cornell.edu/cfr/cfr.php?title=16&amp;type=part&amp;value=432|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130103725/http://cfr.law.cornell.edu/cfr/cfr.php?title=16|deadurl=yes|archivedate=November 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; to combat the unrealistic power claims made by many hi-fi amplifier manufacturers.  This rule prescribes continuous power measurements performed with sine wave signals for advertising and specifications of amplifiers sold in the US. (See more in the section '''Standards''' at the end of this article).  This rule was amended in 1998 to cover self-powered speakers such as are commonly used with personal computers (see examples below).

Typically, an amplifier's power specifications are calculated by measuring its RMS output voltage, with a continuous sine wave signal, at the onset of clipping—defined arbitrarily as a stated percentage of [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD), usually 1%, into specified load resistances. Typical loads used are 8 and 4 ohms per channel; many amplifiers used in professional audio are also specified at 2 ohms.  Considerably more power can be delivered if distortion is allowed to increase; some manufacturers quote maximum power at a higher distortion, like 10%, making their equipment appear more powerful than if measured at an acceptable distortion level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/product/LM4753|title=LM4753 Dual 10W Audio Power Amplifier|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ti.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-28|quote=capable of delivering 10W/channel at 10% distortion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuous power measurements do not actually describe the highly varied signals found in audio equipment (which could vary from high [[crest factor]] instrument recordings down to 0&amp;nbsp;dB crest factor [[square wave]]s) but are widely regarded as a reasonable way of describing an amplifier's maximum output capability. For audio equipment, this is nearly always the nominal frequency range of human hearing, 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz.

In loudspeakers, thermal capacities of the voice coils and magnet structures largely determine continuous power handling ratings. However, at the lower end of a loudspeaker's usable frequency range, its power handling might necessarily be derated because of mechanical excursion limits. For example, a [[subwoofer]] rated at 100 [[watt]]s may be able to handle 100 watts of power at 80 [[hertz]], but at 25 hertz it might not be able to handle nearly as much power since such frequencies would, for some drivers in some enclosures, force the driver beyond its mechanical limits much before reaching 100 watts from the amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkwitzlab.com/thor_splmax.htm|title=Electrical and mechanical limits|last=|first=|date=|website=www.linkwitzlab.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-28|quote=It should be clear [...] that amplifier power is not an issue at the low frequency end of the subwoofer range, but at high frequencies. The lowest frequency output is driver excursion limited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak power=== 

''Peak power'' refers to the maximum of the instantaneous power waveform, which, for a sine wave, always get a factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; the average power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://proaudioblog.co.uk/2015/04/pa-power-ratings-1-know-whats-watt/|title=Power Ratings: Know What's Watt - ProAudioBlog.co.uk|last=|first=|date=2015-04-13|work=|newspaper=ProAudioBlog.co.uk|language=en-US|quote=For a sine wave, the peak power is twice the continuous average power.|access-date=2016-10-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/SLEA047|title=Power Rating in Audio Amplifiers|last=Luu|first=Tuan|date=March 2005|website=|publisher=Texas Instruments|access-date=|quote=Peak power ratings are obtained by using peak voltage. [...] If the dynamic headroom of an audio amplifier is specified at 3 dB, then the amplifier can deliver two times its average power; e.g., if the amplifier is rated for 200 W average power, then the peak power is 400 W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1274915|title=Understanding Class-D amplifier power supply requirements {{!}} EE Times|last=|first=|date=|website=EETimes|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-28|quote=The peak power that an amplifier can deliver to the load is [...] PSE(PEAK) = [...] 2 • PSE(RMS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For other waveforms, the relationship between peak power and average power is the [[Peak-to-average ratio|peak-to-average power ratio]] (PAPR).

The peak power of an amplifier is determined by the voltage rails and the maximum amount of current its electronic components can handle for an instant without damage. This characterizes the ability of equipment to handle quickly changing power levels, as many audio signals have a highly dynamic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prestonelectronics.com/audio/Speakers.htm|title=Speaker Selection and Amplifier Power Ratings|last=|first=|date=|website=www.prestonelectronics.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-28|quote=In an amplifier, the maximum peak power output to a speaker is limited by the amplifier power supply. [...] In an amplifier, the peak power rating is useful for describing the maximum instantaneous limit of its capability for pulse sounds such as drumbeats and bass notes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It always produces a higher value than the average power figure, however, and so has been tempting to use in advertising without context, making it look as though the amp has twice the power of competitors.

===Total system power===
'''Total system power''' is a term often used in [[Audio engineering|audio electronics]] to rate the power of an audio system. Total system power refers to the total [[Energy consumption|power consumption]] of the unit, rather than the power handling of the [[Loudspeaker|speakers]] or the power output of the [[amplifier]]. This can be viewed as a somewhat deceptive [[marketing]] ploy, as the total power consumption of the unit will of course be greater than any of its other power ratings, except for, perhaps, the peak power of the amplifier, which is essentially an exaggerated value anyway.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Shelf stereo]]s and [[surround sound]] receivers are often rated using total system power.

One way to use total system power to get a more accurate estimate of power is to consider the [[amplifier class]] which would give an educated guess of the power output by considering the efficiency of the class. For example, [[class AB amplifier]]s can vary widely from 25% to 75%[http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/products/details/t400-2] efficiency while Class D amps are much higher at 80% to 95%[http://epsilonelectronicsinc.com/news/2015/08/11/soundstream-is-now-shipping-stealth-124-marine-amplifiers/]. An exceptionally efficient Class D amp, the [[ROHM]] BD5421efs, operates at 90% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800464222_499501_NP_c0bbb082.HTM|title=Class-D amplifier guarantees 90% efficiency|date=2007-05-14|website=EE Times-Asia|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, an audio device may be measured by the ''total system power'' of all its loudspeakers by adding all their peak power ratings. Many [[home theater in a box]] systems are rated this way. Often low-end home theater systems' power ratings are taken at a high level of [[harmonic distortion]] as well; as high as 10%, which would be noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hometheater.about.com/cs/audiocomponents/a/aapowermada.htm|title=Don't Get Seduced by Amplifier Power Specifications|website=About.com Tech|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PMPO ===
''PMPO'', which stands for ''Peak Music Power Output''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxSVKd7D7i4C&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=%22peak%20music%20power%20output%22&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=%22peak%20music%20power%20output%22&amp;f=false|title=The Wordsworth Dictionary of Abbreviations and Acronyms|last=Dale|first=Rodney|last2=Puttick|first2=Steve|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|year=|isbn=9781853263859|location=|page=127|language=en|quote=PMPO peak music power output|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4iuIdjZBBMC&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=%22peak%20music%20power%20output%22&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q=%22peak%20music%20power%20output%22&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of technical abbreviations: English - German|last=Huzau|first=Alexander C.|date=2000-01-01|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|year=|isbn=9783831112999|location=|page=246|language=|quote=PMPO acoustic. peak music power output|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Peak momentary performance output'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/general/docs/litabsmultiplefilelist.tsp?literatureNumber=slea047a|title=Power Rating in Audio Amplifier (Rev.

Different manufacturers use different definitions, so that the ratio of PMPO to continuous power output varies widely; it is not possible to convert from one to the other. Most amplifiers can sustain their PMPO for only a very short time, if at all; loudspeakers are not designed to withstand their stated PMPO for anything but a momentary peak without serious damage.

== Power and loudness in the real world ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Perceived "[[loudness]]" varies approximately [[logarithmic scale|logarithmically]] with acoustical output power. The change in perceived loudness as a function of change in acoustical power is dependent on the reference power level. It is both useful and technically accurate to express perceived loudness in the logarithmic [[decibel]] (dB) scale that is independent of the reference power, with a somewhat straight-line relationship between 10&amp;nbsp;dB changes and doublings of perceived loudness.

The approximately logarithmic relationship between power and perceived loudness is an important factor in audio system design. Both amplifier power and speaker sensitivity affect the maximum realizable loudness. Standard measurement practice of speaker sensitivity is driving 1 watt electrical power to the source, with the receiver 1 meter away from the source, and measuring the resulting acoustical power in dB relative to the threshold of hearing (defined as 0&amp;nbsp;dB). Sensitivity is typically measured either suspended in an anechoic chamber in 'free space' (for full range speakers), or with the source and receiver outside on the ground in 'half space' (for a subwoofer).

While a doubling/halving of perceived loudness corresponds to approximately 10&amp;nbsp;dB increase/decrease in speaker sensitivity, it also corresponds to approximately 10X multiplication/division of acoustical power. Even a relatively modest 3&amp;nbsp;dB increase/decrease in sensitivity corresponds to a doubling/halving of acoustical power. When measuring in 'half space', the boundary of the ground plane cuts the available space that the sound radiates into in half and doubles the acoustical power at the receiver, for a corresponding 3&amp;nbsp;dB increase in measured sensitivity, so it is important to know the test conditions. ±3&amp;nbsp;dB change in measured sensitivity also corresponds to a similar doubling/halving of electrical power required to generate a given perceived loudness, so even deceptively 'minor' differences in sensitivity can result in large changes in amplifier power requirement. This is important because power amplifiers become increasingly impractical with increasing amplifier power output.

Many high quality domestic speakers have a sensitivity between ~84&amp;nbsp;dB and ~94&amp;nbsp;dB, but professional speakers can have a sensitivity between ~90&amp;nbsp;dB and ~100&amp;nbsp;dB. An '84&amp;nbsp;dB' source would require a 400-watt amplifier to produce the same acoustical power (perceived loudness) as a '90&amp;nbsp;dB' source being driven by a 100-watt amplifier, or a '100&amp;nbsp;dB' source being driven by a 10 watt amplifier. A good measure of the 'power' of a system is therefore a plot of maximum loudness before clipping of the amplifier and loudspeaker combined, in dB SPL, at the listening position intended, over the audible frequency spectrum. The human ear is less sensitive to low frequencies, as indicated by [[Equal-loudness contours]], so a well-designed system should be capable of generating relatively higher sound levels below 100&amp;nbsp;Hz before clipping.

Like perceived loudness, speaker sensitivity also varies with frequency and power. The sensitivity is measured at 1 watt to minimize nonlinear effects such as power compression and harmonic distortion, and averaged over the usable bandwidth. The bandwidth is often specified between the measured '+/-3&amp;nbsp;dB' cutoff frequencies where the relative loudness becomes attenuated from the peak loudness by at least 6&amp;nbsp;dB. Some speaker manufacturers use '+3&amp;nbsp;dB/-6&amp;nbsp;dB' instead, to take into account the real-world in-room response of a speaker at frequency extremes where the floor/wall/ceiling boundaries may increase the perceived loudness.

Speaker sensitivity is measured and rated on the assumption of a fixed amplifier output voltage because audio amplifiers tend to behave like voltage sources. Sensitivity can be a misleading metric due to differences in speaker impedance between differently designed speakers. A speaker with a higher impedance may have lower measured sensitivity and thus appear to be less efficient than a speaker with a lower impedance even though their efficiencies are actually similar. Speaker efficiency is a metric that only measures the actual percentage of electrical power that the speaker converts to acoustic power and is sometimes a more appropriate metric to use when investigating ways to achieve a given acoustic power from a speaker.

Adding an identical and mutually coupled speaker driver (much less than a wavelength away from each other) and splitting the electrical power equally between the two drivers increases their combined efficiency by a maximum of 3&amp;nbsp;dB, similar to increasing the size of a single driver until the diaphragm area doubles. Multiple drivers can be more practical to increase efficiency than larger drivers since frequency response is generally proportional to driver size.

System designers take advantage of this efficiency boost by using mutually coupled drivers in a speaker cabinet, and by using mutually coupled speaker cabinets in a venue. Each doubling of total driver area in the array of drivers brings ~3&amp;nbsp;dB increase in efficiency until the limit where the total distance between any two drivers of the array exceeds ~1/4 wavelength.

Power handling capability is also doubled when the number of drivers doubles, for a maximum realizable increase of ~6&amp;nbsp;dB in total acoustic output per doubling of mutually coupled drivers when the total amplifier power is also doubled. Mutual coupling efficiency gains become difficult to realize with multiple drivers at higher frequencies because the total size of a single driver including its diaphragm, basket, waveguide or horn may already exceed one wavelength.

Sources that are much smaller than a wavelength behave like point sources that radiate omnidirectionally in free space, whereas sources larger than a wavelength act as their own 'ground plane' and beam the sound forward. This beaming tends to make high frequency dispersion problematic in larger venues, so a designer may have to cover the listening area with multiple sources aimed in various directions or placed in various locations.

Likewise, speaker proximity much less than 1/4 wavelength to one or more boundaries such as floor/walls/ceiling can increase the effective sensitivity by changing free space into half space, quarter space, or eighth space. When the distance to boundaries is &gt; 1/4 wavelength, delayed reflections can increase the perceived loudness but can also induce ambient effects such as comb filtering and reverberation that can make the frequency response uneven across a venue or make the sound diffuse and harsh, especially with smaller venues and hard reflective surfaces.

Sound absorbing structures, sound diffusing structures, and digital signal processing may be employed to compensate for boundary effects within the designated listening area.

== 'Music power' — the real issues ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
The term ''"Music Power"'' has been used in relation to both amplifiers and loudspeakers with some validity. When live music is recorded without amplitude compression or limiting, the resulting signal contains brief peaks of much higher amplitude (20&amp;nbsp;dB or more) than the mean, and since power is proportional to the square of signal voltage their reproduction would require an amplifier capable of providing brief peaks of power around a hundred times greater than the average level. Thus, the ideal 100-watt audio system would need to be capable of handling brief peaks of 10,000 watts in order to avoid clipping{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} (see [[Programme levels]]). Most loudspeakers are in fact capable of withstanding peaks of several times their continuous rating (though not a hundred times) since thermal inertia prevents the voice coils from burning out on short bursts. It is therefore, acceptable, and desirable, to drive a loudspeaker from a power amplifier with a higher continuous rating several times the steady power that the speaker can withstand, but only if care is taken not to overheat it; this is difficult, especially on modern recordings which tend to be heavily [[Dynamic range compression|compressed]] and so can be played at high levels without the obvious distortion that would result from an uncompressed recording when the amplifier started clipping.

An amplifier can be designed with an audio output circuitry capable of generating a certain power level, but with a power supply unable to supply sufficient power for more than a very short time, and with [[heat sink]]ing that will overheat dangerously if full output power is maintained for long. This makes good technical and commercial sense, as the amplifier can handle music with a relatively low mean power, but with brief peaks; a high 'music power' output can be advertised (and delivered), and money saved on the power supply and heat sink. Program sources that are significantly compressed are more likely to cause trouble, as the mean power can be much higher for the same peak power. Circuitry which protects the amplifier and power supply can prevent equipment damage in the case of sustained high power operation.

More sophisticated equipment usually used in a professional context has advanced circuitry which can handle high peak power levels without delivering more average power to the speakers than they and the amplifier can handle safely.

==Matching amplifier to loudspeaker==
Charles "Chuck" McGregor, while serving as senior technologist for [[Eastern Acoustic Works]], wrote a guideline for [[professional audio]] purchasers wishing to select properly sized amplifiers for their loudspeakers. Chuck McGregor recommended a rule of thumb in which the amplifier's maximum power output rating was twice the loudspeaker's continuous (so-called "RMS") rating, give or take 20%. In his example, a loudspeaker with a continuous power rating of 250&amp;nbsp;watts would be well-matched by an amplifier with a maximum power output within the range of 400 to 625&amp;nbsp;watts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/how_many_watts_loudspeaker/ ProSoundWeb, Study Hall. Chuck McGregor, ''How Many Watts : Amps vs. Loudspeakers: The eternal question answered - what's the "right" wattage for my loudspeakers.''] Retrieved February 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[JBL]], which tests and labels their loudspeakers according to the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 268-5 standard (called IEC 60268-5 more recently) has a more nuanced set of recommendations, depending on the usage profile of the system, which more fundamentally involves the (worst case) [[crest factor]] of the signal used to drive the loudspeakers:&lt;ref name="jbl"&gt;[http://www.jblpro.com/pub/technote/spkpwfaq.pdf JBL Speaker Power Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;
# For "carefully monitored applications where peak transient capability must be maintained, a system should be powered with an amplifier capable of delivering twice its IEC rating." As an example, a [[studio monitor]] rated at 300 watts IEC, can be safely driven by a 600 watts (RMS) amplifiers, provided that "peak signals are normally of such short duration that they hardly stress the system's components".&lt;ref name="jbl"/&gt;
# For "routine application where high continuous, but non-distorted, output is likely to be encountered, a system should be powered with an amplifier capable of delivering the IEC rating of the system". This includes most consumer systems. "Such systems can often be inadvertently overdriven, or can go into feedback. When powered with an amplifier equal to their IEC rating, the user is guaranteed of safe operation."&lt;ref name="jbl"/&gt;
#  "For musical instrument application, where distorted (overdriven) output may be a musical requirement, the system should be powered with an amplifier capable of delivering only one-half of the IEC rating for the system." This necessary because, for example, an amplifier normally outputting "300 watts of undistorted sinewave" can reach closer to 600 watts of power when [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]] (i.e. when its output is closer to a [[square wave]]). If such a scenario is plausible, then for safe operation of the loudspeaker, the amplifier's (RMS) rating must no more than half the IEC power of the loudspeaker.&lt;ref name="jbl"/&gt;

== Power handling in 'active' speakers ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
'''Active speakers''' comprise two or three speakers per channel, each fitted with its own amplifier, and preceded by an electronic [[audio crossover|crossover]] filter to separate the low-level audio signal into the frequency bands to be handled by each speaker. This approach enables complex active filters to be used on the low level signal, without the need to use passive crossovers of high [[power handling]] capability but limited [[rolloff]] and with large and expensive inductors and capacitors. An additional advantage is that peak power handling is greater if the signal has simultaneous peaks in two different frequency bands. A single amplifier has to handle the peak power when both signal voltages are at their crest; as power is proportional to the square of voltage, the peak power when both signals are at the same peak voltage is proportional to the square of the sum of the voltages. If separate amplifiers are used, each must handle the square of the peak voltage in its own band. For example, if bass and midrange each has a signal corresponding to 10 W of output, a single amplifier capable of handling a 40 W peak would be needed, but a bass and a treble amplifier each capable of handling 10 W would be sufficient. This is relevant when peaks of comparable amplitude occur in different frequency bands, as with wideband percussion and high-amplitude bass notes.

For most audio applications more power is needed at low frequencies. This requires a high-power amplifier for low frequencies (e.g., 200 watts for 20–200&amp;nbsp;Hz band), lower power amplifier for the midrange (e.g., 50 watts for  200 to 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz), and even less the high end (e.g. 5 watts for 1000–20000&amp;nbsp;Hz). Proper design of a bi/tri amplifier system requires a study of driver (speaker) frequency response and sensitivities to determine optimal crossover frequencies and power amplifier powers.

== Regional Variations ==

===US===
Peak momentary power output and peak music power output are two different measurements with different specifications and should not be used interchangeably.  Manufacturers who use different words such as pulse or performance may be reflecting their own non-standard system of measurement, with an unknown meaning.  The [[Federal Trade Commission]] is putting an end to this with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Rule 46 CFR 432 (1974), affecting Power Output Claims for Amplifiers Utilized in Home Entertainment Products.

In response to a Federal Trade Commission order, the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] has established a clear and concise measure of audio power for consumer electronics. They have posted an FTC approved product marking template on their web site and the full standard is available for a fee.
Many believe this will resolve much of the ambiguity and confusion in amplifier ratings.
There will be ratings for speaker and powered speaker system too. This specification only applies to audio amplifiers. An EU counterpart is expected and all equipment sold in the US and Europe will be identically tested and rated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce.org/Standards/3108.asp CEA-490-A: Test Methods of Measurement for Audio Amplifiers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722193247/http://www.ce.org/Standards/3108.asp |date=July 22, 2011 }}, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Rule, Power Output Claims for Amplifiers Utilized in Home Entertainment Products, 46 CFR 432 (1974). Accessed 2011-08-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

This regulation did not cover automobile entertainment systems, which consequently still suffer from power ratings confusion.  However, a new Approved American National Standard ANSI/CEA-2006-B which includes testing &amp; measurement methods for mobile audio amplifiers is being slowly phased into the market by many manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ce.org/Standards/browseByCommittee_2648.asp |title=CEA Standard for testing mobile audio equipment |accessdate=2011-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718065137/http://www.ce.org/Standards/browseByCommittee_2648.asp |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee (AICC)'''  was an international association of technology-based training professionals that existed from 1988 to 2014.  The AICC developed guidelines for [[aviation]] industry in the development, delivery, and evaluation of [[Computer-based training|CBT]], [[Web-based training|WBT]], and related training technologies.  

AICC specifications were usually designed to be general purpose (not necessarily Aviation Specific) so that learning technology vendors can spread their costs across multiple markets and thus provide products (needed by the Aviation Industry) at a lower cost.  This strategy resulted in AICC specifications having broad acceptance and relevance to non-aviation and aviation users alike.

==History==

The AICC was formed in 1988 by Aircraft manufacturers ([[Boeing]], [[Airbus]], and [[McDonnell Douglas]]) to address Airline concerns about non-standard computing (cost) issues arising from the proliferation of new multimedia training materials emerging at that time.

In 1989, the AICC published computing platform recommendations for [[Computer-based training|CBT]],  training media. A PC-platform was established as the primary delivery platform for [[Computer-based training|CBT]] media. 

In 1992, the AICC produced a digital audio interoperability specification for DOS based platforms.  This specification allowed multiple CBT vendors to use a single audio card.  AICC audio drivers were produced for Elan, SoundBlaster(tm), WICAT, and other audio cards. A large number of older legacy [[Computer-based training|CBT]] applications still use this specification today.

In 1993, the AICC produced what is widely regarded as the first runtime interoperability specification for [[learning management system|Learning Management System]]s (LMS) a.k.a. [[Computer Managed Instruction|CMI]] Systems. This AICC specification (CMI001 - AICC/CMI Guidelines For Interoperability) was originally designed for CD-ROM/[[LAN]] (local file-based) operation and was updated in January 1998 to add a web-based interface called HACP ([[HTTP]]-based AICC/CMI Protocol). In September 1999, the CMI001 specification was updated to add a [[JavaScript]] [[API]] runtime interface.  The runtime environment data model and [[API]] used in the [[SCORM]] specification is a derivative of this work.

==Current==

The AICC HACP standard for CMI is widely used by [[Learning Management System]]s and other systems to call content and assessments. Although it is pre-[[XML]], it is very robust and unambiguous and many consider it to be more secure and reliable than alternatives such as [[SCORM]], especially for content or assessments hosted on web servers not collocated with the calling system.

An emerging standard is the AICC [[PENS (software)|PENS]] standard, which lets content creating tools send a manifest to an LMS easily. (See  CMI010 - Package Exchange Notification Services).  The September 2006 AICC meeting included a Plugfest where vendors demonstrated PENS interoperability. 

In November 2010, the AICC announced that it would begin work on a replacement of its existing CMI specification.  This effort was later given the name "CMI-5".  A SOAP-Based specification for CMI-5 was drafted in May 2012 but was never formally released.

In October 2012,  the AICC announced that it had adopted the Experience API (xAPI) specification (a.k.a. "Tin Can") for its CMI-5 effort starting a significant re-design that is currently in progress.  

The AICC coordinated its efforts with other learning technology specifications organizations engaged in similar work such as IMS Global, [[Open Knowledge Initiative|OKI]], [[Advanced Distributed Learning|ADL]], [http://ieeeltsc.org IEEE/LTSC], [[LETSI]], and [http://jtc1sc36.org ISO/SC36.]

In December 2014, the AICC formally announced that it had dissolved citing declining participation.  
The AICC transferred the CMI-5 effort and its document archive to the ADL.

[[File:Badge reel.JPG|thumbnail|A badge tether with clips suited for [[skiwear]] and a ski pass, since skiwear typically has dedicated loops for attachment.]]
A '''badge tether''' or '''badge reel''' is a spring-loaded [[reel]]ed [[tether]] that resembles a [[button badge]] in appearance or attachment. It is used to avoid damage to or the loss of small important objects kept on-person that need to be accessed frequently or quickly, such as a [[ski pass]], identification card or badge, name badge, keys, a phone or other handheld device, or a penknife or other small tool.

Badge tethers consist of a thin cord, dimensions on the order of a millimetre diameter by a metre long with one end wound round a spring-loaded reel contained within a small badge-like body that has a clip for a belt, belt loop, pocket, the edge of the clothing itself, or an attachment specifically for such a tether. The other end of the cord has a clip, loop, [[keyring|splitring]], strap, or other fastener.

[[Single-walled carbon nanotubes]] have the ability to conduct electricity. This conduction can be [[Ballistic conduction|ballistic]], [[diffusive conduction|diffusive]], or based on scattering. When ballistic in nature conductance can be treated as if the electrons experience no scattering.

== Conductance quantization and Landauer formula ==
[[File:band structure CNT.jpg|thumb|400px|Figure 1: a) Energy contour plot of the electronic band structure in CNTs.; b) Linear dependence of the electron energy on the wave vector in CNTs; c) Dispersion relation near the Fermi energy for a semiconducting CNT; d) Dispersion relation near the Fermi energy for a metallic CNT]]
Conduction in single-walled [[carbon nanotube]]s is quantized due to their one-dimensionality and the number of allowed electronic states is limited, if compared to bulk graphite. The nanotubes behave consequently as [[quantum wire]]s and charge carriers are transmitted through discrete conduction channels. This conduction mechanism can be either ballistic or diffusive in nature, or based on tunneling. When ballistically conducted, the electrons travel through the nanotubes channel without experiencing [[Carrier scattering|scattering]] due to impurities, local defects or lattice vibrations. As a result, the electrons encounter no resistance and no energy dissipation occurs in the conduction channel.
In order to estimate the current in the carbon nanotube channel, the Landauer formula can be applied, which considers a one-dimensional channel, connected to two contacts – source and drain.

Assuming no scattering and ideal (transparent) contacts, the conductance of the one-dimensional system is given by G = G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;NT, where T is the probability that an electron will be transmitted along the channel, N is the number of the channels available for transport, and G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[conductance quantum]] 2e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/h = (12.9kΩ)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Perfect contacts, with reflection R = 0, and no back scattering along the channel result in transmission probability T = 1 and the conductance of the system becomes G = (2e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/h) N. Thus each channel contributes 2G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to the total conductance.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Changxin, and Yafei Zhang. "Nanowelded Carbon Nanotubes from Field-effect Transistors to Solar Microcells", Heidelberg: Springer, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
For metallic [[Armchair nanotube#Electronic structure of carbon nanotube|armchair nanotubes]], there are two subbands, which cross the [[Fermi level]], and for semiconducting nanotubes – bands which don’t cross the Fermi level. Thus there are two conducting channels and each band accommodates two electrons of opposite spin. Thus the value of the conductance is G = 2G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (6.45 kΩ)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = C. T. | last2 = Todorov | first2 = T. N. | year = 1998 | title =  Carbon nanotubes as long ballistic conductors | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 393 | issue = 6682| pages = 240–242 | doi = 10.1038/30420 | bibcode = 1998Natur.393..240W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a non-ideal system, T in the Landauer formula is replaced by the sum of the transmission probabilities for each conduction channel. When the value of the conductance for the above example approaches the ideal value of 2G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the conduction along the channel is said to be ballistic. This happens when the scattering length in the nanotube is much greater than the distance between the contacts.
If a carbon nanotube is a ballistic conductor, but the contacts are nontransparent, the transmission probability, T, is reduced by back-scattering in the contacts. If the contacts are perfect, the reduced T is due to back-scattering along the nanotube only.
When the resistance measured at the contacts is high, one can infer the presence of [[Coulomb blockade]] and [[Luttinger liquid]] behavior for different temperatures. Low contact resistance is a prerequisite for investigating conduction phenomena in CNTs in the high transmission regime.

== Quantum Interference ==
When the size of the CNT device scales with the electron coherence length, important in the ballistic conduction regime in CNTs becomes the interference pattern arising when measuring the differential conductance &lt;math&gt;dI/dV&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the gate voltage.&lt;ref&gt;Physical Properties of Ceramic and Carbon Nanoscale Structures The Infn Lectures. Springer Verlag, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern is due to the quantum interference of multiply reflected electrons in the CNT channel. Effectively, this corresponds to a Fabry-Perot resonator, where the nanotube acts as a coherent waveguide and the resonant cavity is formed between the two CNT-electrode interfaces. Phase coherent transport, electron interference, and localized states have been observed in the form of fluctuations in the conductance as a function of the Fermi energy.

Phase coherent electrons give rise to the observed interference effect at low temperatures. Coherence then corresponds to a decrease in the occupation numbers of phonon modes and a decreased rate of inelastic scattering. Correspondingly, increased conduction is reported for low temperatures.

== Ballistic Conduction in CNT Field-Effect Transistors ==
CNT FETs exhibit four regimes of charge transport:
* ohmic contact ballistic
* ohmic contact diffusive
* [[Schottky barrier]] ballistic
* Schottky barrier diffusive
[[Ohmic contact]]s require no scattering as the charge carriers are transported through the channel, i.e. the length of the CNT should be much smaller than the [[Inelastic mean free path|mean free path]] (L&lt;&lt; l&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;). The opposite is valid for diffusive transport.
In semiconducting CNTs at room temperature and for low energies, the mean free path is determined by the electron scattering from acoustic phonons, which results in l&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.5μm. In order to satisfy the conditions for ballistic transport, one has to take care of the channel length and the properties of the contacts, while the geometry of the device could be any [[Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor#Top-gated CNTFETs|top-gated doped CNT FET]].

Ballistic transport in a CNT FET takes place when the length of the conducting channel is much smaller than the mean free path of the charge carrier, l&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Ballistic conduction in Ohmic Contact FETs ===
Ohmic i.e. transparent contacts are most favorable for an optimized current flow in a FET.
In order to derive the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for a ballistic CNT FET, one can start with Planck's postulate, which relates the energy of the i-th state to its frequency:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E_i=h\nu_i=\frac{h}{2e}\frac{2e}{T_i}=\frac{h}{2e}I_i &lt;/math&gt;

The total current for a many-state system is then the sum over the energy of each state multiplied by the occupation probability function, in this case the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]:

&lt;math&gt;I_i=\frac{2e}{h}\sum_{i}E_i\frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{E-E_f}{k_BT}}} &lt;/math&gt;

For a system with dense states, the discrete sum can be approximated by an integral:

&lt;math&gt;I_i=\frac{2e}{h}\int \frac{1}{1+e^{\frac{E-E_f}{k_BT}}}dE &lt;/math&gt;

In CNT FETs, the charge carriers move either left (negative velocity) or right (positive velocity) and the resulting net current is called drain current. The source potential controls the right-moving, and the drain potential - the left moving carriers and if the source potential is set to zero, the Fermi energy at the drain subsequently decreases to yield positive drain voltage. The total drain current is computed as a sum of all contributing subbands in the semiconductor CNT, but given the low voltages used with nanoscale electronics, higher subbands can be effectively ignored and the drain current is given only by the contribution of the first subband:

&lt;math&gt;I_d=I_0 \left \{ \ln\left [ 1+e^{2e\phi _s-\frac{E_g}{2kT}} \right ]-\ln\left [ 1+ e^{2e\phi _s-2eV_d -\frac{E_g}{2kT}}\right ] \right \}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_0=\frac{4e}{h}kT=\frac{kT}{eR_0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is the quantum resistance.

The expression for &lt;math&gt;I_d&lt;/math&gt; gives the ballistic current dependence on the voltage in a CNT FET with ideal contacts.

=== Ballistic conduction with Optical Phonon Scattering ===
Ideally, ballistic transport in CNT FETs requires no scattering from [[Phonon#Acoustic and optical phonons|optical or acoustic phonons]], however the analytical model yields only partial agreement with experimental data. Thus, one needs to consider a mechanism, which would improve the agreement and recalibrate the definition of ballistic conduction in CNTs. Partially ballistic transport is modeled to involve optical phonon scattering. Scattering of electrons by optical phonons in carbon nanotube channels has two requirements:
* The traveled length in the conduction channel between source and drain has to be greater than the optical phonon mean free path
* The electron energy has to be greater than the critical optical phonon emission energy

=== Schottky barrier Ballistic conduction ===
[[File:Ballistic CNTFET Schottky barrier.jpg|thumb|400px|Figure 2: Example of the band structure of a ballistic CNT FET. a) The net current through the channel is the difference between the electrons tunneling from the source and holes tunneling from the drain.; b) ON-state: the current is produced by the source electrons; c) OFF-state: hole leakage current induced by drain holes.]]
CNT FETs with Schottky contacts are easier to fabricate than those with ohmic contacts. In these transistors, the gate voltage controls the thickness of the barrier, and the drain voltage can lower the barrier height at the drain electrode. Quantum tunneling of the electrons through the barrier should also be taken into account here. In order to understand the charge conduction in Schottky barrier CNT FETs, we need to study the band schemes under different bias conditions &lt;ref&gt;Wong, H. -S. Philip, and Deji ,. Akinwande. "Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Device Physics", Cambridge UP, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;(Fig 2):
* the net current is a result of electrons tunneling from the source and holes tunneling from the drain
* ON-state: electrons tunneling from the source
* OFF-state: holes tunneling from the drain
Thus, the Schottky barrier CNT FET is effectively an ambipolar transistor, since the ON electron current is opposed by an OFF hole current, which flows at values smaller than the critical gate voltage value.

From the band diagrams, one can deduce the &lt;math&gt;I_d - V_g&lt;/math&gt; characteristics of the Schottky CNT FETs. Starting at the OFF state, there is hole current, which gradually decreases as the gate voltage is increased until it is opposed with equal strength by the electron current coming from the source. Above the critical gate voltage in the ON state, the electron current prevails and reaches a maximum at &lt;math&gt;V_g=V_d&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;I-V&lt;/math&gt; curve will roughly have a V-shape.

'''Barry Allen Clemson''' (born 1941) is an American [[cybernetics|cybernetician]]. His work experience includes custom manufacturing, community development (in the US and India), software development, university research and teaching, starting a construction company, consulting, and writing a novel. His academic career was in educational administration ([[University of Maryland]] and [[University of Maine]]) and engineering management ([[Old Dominion University]])

During his first academic post, at the University of Maryland, Clemson was elected President of the [[American Society for Cybernetics]] (ASC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc-cybernetics.org American Society for Cybernetics - Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time there was a split within the American cybernetics community, with some who had been members of the ASC having joined a new group called the American Cybernetics Association (ACA). Working with Larry Heilprin and [[Klaus Krippendorff]], the three of them were able to merge the two groups and arrange for an election in which [[Stuart Umpleby]] was elected as president. Umpleby was able to rejuvenate the ASC and put it onto a trajectory which continues to this day.

== Key experiences ==

=== Alaska wilderness ===
In 1948, shortly before his seventh birthday, Clemson's family, with siblings aged six, four and six months, moved from the Lancaster, Pennsylvania area to a wilderness homestead two miles north of [[Anchor Point, Alaska]]. Anchor Point consisted of a couple of families and a tiny trading post. The nearest road was 20 miles away in [[Homer, Alaska|Homer]] and Homer could be reached only by boat or plane.  They spent the first summer in a tent and the following two years in a log cabin with a dirt floor. Water came from a spring a hundred yards away (during the summer) and from melted snow in winter. Food was largely hunted (mostly moose) or from the garden. After guiding the dog sled home from school, chores included splitting wood. Wilderness Alaska nurtured a love of nature and required both self-sufficiency and lots of responsibility at a very early age.

=== Mississippi Freedom Summer ===
Clemson spent almost a year (June 1964 to April 1965) in Mississippi working on [[Freedom Summer|voter registration]] with the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). This project was transformative for most of the volunteers who participated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McAdams|first1=Doug.|title=Freedom Summer|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sunderland|first1=Elizabeth|title=Letters from Mississippi|date=1965|publisher=McGraw Hill, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and it definitely was for Clemson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clemson|first1=Barry|title=Mississippi Freedom Summer: An autobiographical fragment|url=http://www.barryclemson.net/dr-barry-clemson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleagues like [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] vividly and dramatically lived out the fundamental truth that freedom is a state of mind that has nothing to do with one's external circumstances. One always has choices, one can always decide what he or she will or will not do.

During Clemson's work on voter registration his car was shot, a motorcycle cop tried to run over him, he was attacked by two men, another man threatened to kill him with a rifle, and he three times managed to (briefly) integrate Alabama jails. Several times he expected to die but was never even injured. These experiences are recounted in his "[http://www.barryclemson.net/dr-barry-clemson Mississippi Freedom Summer: An autobiographical fragment]"
 
=== Ecumenical Institute&lt;ref&gt;Ecumenical Institute is now called institute of Cultural Affairs, see http://www.ica-usa.org/&lt;/ref&gt; ===
From 1969 to 1972 Clemson was a Fellow of the Ecumenical Institute, now called the [[Institute of Cultural Affairs International|Institute of Cultural Affairs]], at their base in Chicago. The Ecumenical Institute had two main thrusts: community development and renewal of local congregations. The Institute was truly ecumenical, with members from many different Christian denominations and also Jews and Hindus. The Institute understood that fundamental change in societal institutions required a deep spiritual component. The Fellows of the Ecumenical Institute lived as a religious order, under vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]].

=== Management Cybernetics ===
By the time Clemson finished a bachelor's degree in science (1965), he was convinced that large organizations were crucial in the struggle for a more just society. A masters in political science and a PhD in organization theory followed.&lt;ref&gt;All of his university degrees are from Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt; During the masters program, Clemson read a paper by the management cybernetician, [[Stafford Beer]], and was fascinated. Cybernetics presented laws and principles that applied to all complex systems, including human, biological, and physical systems. This paper started a journey into complex systems that continues today and is the reason he considers himself a [[management cybernetics|management cybernetician.]]

=== Strategic Nonviolence ===
Clemson spent ten years running a small construction company after several other, more “intellectual” careers. This ten years of “wandering in the desert” culminated with the realization that all of his varied experiences had equipped him to write a specific kind of novel, a novel that would vividly make the case for the practicality of strategic nonviolence, especially as articulated by [[Gene Sharp|Dr. Gene Sharp]]. The first novel, [http://www.barryclemson.net/barrys-books-2/dr-the-novel Denmark Rising], tells the story of how Denmark used strategic nonviolence to resist the Nazi occupation during World War II.  The novel garnered rave [http://www.barryclemson.net/barrys-books-2/dr-the-novel/reader-reactions reviews] as a vivid, compelling story that convincingly shows the Danes holding their own against Hitler.

=== Healing Prayer ===
Clemson watched his wife, Reverend Dr. Mary Clemson, heal people by praying for them. Mostly out of curiosity, Clemson went through a week of training in healing prayer with [[Francis MacNutt]]. Dr. Francis MacNutt has more than 30 years experience with healing prayer, has written half a dozen influential books on the subject, conducts healing prayer training seminars all over the world, and is the head of [http://www.christianhealingmin.org Christian Healing Ministries]. At Mary's insistence he then prayed for a woman who for many years had been unable to lift her arm above shoulder height. The woman immediately regained the full range of motion and six years later still has full range of motion. Their church now has a major emphasis on healing prayer and dramatic healings occur on a regular basis. As a scientist, Clemson says he has given up trying to understand the efficacy of healing prayer except that the faith of the sick person doesn't seem to have much to do with whether or not they are healed.

== Major publications ==
In Clemson's opinion, he has published only two important works:
# An introduction to the managerial cybernetics of Stafford Beer. This [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0856261661 book], “Cybernetics: a new management tool”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clemson|first1=Barry|title=Cybernetics: A new management tool|date=1984|publisher=Abacus Press|location=Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most easily understood introductions to the subject for those who are new to systems theory and cybernetics.  
# “[http://www.barryclemson.net/barrys-books-2/dr-the-novel Denmark Rising]”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barry|first1=Clemson|title=Denmark Rising|date=2009|publisher=Cybernetica Press|location=Norfolk, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a novel that describes Denmark using strategic nonviolence in a campaign of resistance to Hitler during World War II. The novel is quite effective in convincing the reader that nonviolence could be used effectively even against Hitler.

== Continuing passions ==

=== Long-term viability of humankind ===
Long-term [[Viable system model|viability]] requires dealing with a host of difficult, inter-related crises including but not limited to over-population, ecosystem degradation and species extinction, global warming / climate change, resource shortages, gross inequality and lack of justice, and wars.  If civilization is to survive we need systemic / cybernetic thinking and policies.

=== Effective Governance ===
There is little hope of achieving long-term viability of humankind without effective governance. Government by tyranny obviously doesn't work (and never can work because it lacks requisite variety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Stafford|title=Platform for Change|date=1975|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). Unfortunately, the democratic governments currently in existence are also largely failing. For a number of years, Clemson has been involved with [http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Main_Page systems scientists] and [http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=3680613&amp;trk=anet_ug_hm cyberneticians] from around the world who are grappling with the issue of how we might achieve more effective and more truly democratic forms of governance.

== Recent activities ==

=== Triumph Community Church ===
Clemson, along with his wife and a few others, ran a “children’s church” for the youth in a large public housing project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doucette|first1=John-Henry|title=Celebrating a year of "Children’s church"|date=December 21, 1998|work=The Virginian Pilot|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Against all odds|work=The Community Explorer|date=March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Mathew|title=Leading others in prayer|date=November 20, 2000|work=The Virginian Pilot|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children's church lasted seven years, caring for roughly fifty children during most of that time. Many of these children had no responsible adults in their lives. The church moved out of the housing project a few years ago and shifted its focus from a “children’s church” to an emphasis on healing prayer in one of the poorer neighborhoods of our city. Clemson has served as the administrator for Triumph Community Church since its inception.

=== System Thinking World Journal ===
Clemson is the editor for the on-line, peer-reviewed [http://stwj.systemswiki.org journal] for Systems Thinking World,&lt;ref&gt;[http://stwj.systemswiki.org/ Systems Thinking World Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; an online community of roughly 20,000 people interested in systems thinking and cybernetics.

=== Aikido ===
[[Aikido]], the “way of harmony” or the “way of love” depends upon moving in harmony with the attacker. Succeeding in “moving in harmony with the attacker” will throw that person across the room with essentially no effort. It is the most cybernetic of the martial arts and Clemson has loved it since he began training almost 20 years ago.

===''Publishing  and Teaching'' ===
As of 2014, there are several novels in various stages of development and a series of online courses on management cybernetics are being prepared.

== Family ==

Clemson is married to Reverend Dr. Mary Clemson. Their combined family includes five children, nine grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren (as of 2014). His parents, now in their nineties, are again living in Alaska where Clemson grew up.

=== Favorite Quotes ===
Clemson insists that the following quotes tell you where his center is.

"It's not how much you do, its how much love you put into it … Do small things with great love." -- [[Mother Teresa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/838305.Mother_Teresa Mother Teresa Quotes (Author of Come Be My Light)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; --

"The entire cosmos waits to see what vision we commit to." -- [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]]—The Ontological Covenant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Thomas|title=The Great Work: Our way into the future|date=1999|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Thomas Berry]],  might serve as the foundation for a cybernetic ethic. The following quotes provide a sense of the Ontological Covenant:

* Law of viability. For a species to remain viable it must establish a niche that is beneficial both for itself and for the larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Thomas|title=The Great Work: Our way into the future|date=1999|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Diversity corollary: the only security for any species is the diversity of the comprehensive community of life. As soon as diversity diminishes, then security for each life form is weakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Thomas|title=The Great Work: Our way into the future|date=1999|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Identity corollary: The various life forms are so intimately related that nothing is itself without everything else. Nothing exists in isolation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Thomas|title=The Great Work: Our way into the future|date=1999|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciprocity corollary: Any being can benefit only if the larger context of its existence benefits. Whoever receives must also give.” &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Research shows that attitudes about science, math, and technology start to form during early education.  This book shows how to successfully use technology in the classroom, using a [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] approach to teaching and learning.  Bers focusses on robotic manipulatives that allow children to explore complex concepts in a concrete and fun way (Bers,2008).

A '''calculator watch''' is a [[digital watch]] with a built in [[calculator]], usually including buttons on the watch face. Calculator watches were first introduced in the 1970s and continue to be produced, despite falling from their peak popularity during the 1980s. The most notable brand is the [[Casio Databank]] series, though watches made by [[Timex Group|Timex]] were also popular.

Most calculator watches contain only a few number of functions such as +, -, x, / and percents. However, there are several models with additional functions: scientific, including transcendent and trigonometry, in models Casio CFX-200, CFX-400, Citizen 49-9421, and also financial functions (in the Casio CBA-10).

Usually calculator watch operates with eight digits number, however, calculator watch can operate with 6 digits (for example, Casio C-801) or 10 digits (Casio CBA-10) numbers.

== History ==

Calculator watches first appeared in the mid 1970s introduced by [[Pulsar (watch)|Pulsar]] (1975, then a brand of the [[Hamilton Watch Company]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879586,00.html Going Digital], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', December 22, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~schubert/Light-Emitting-Diodes-dot-org/chap01/chap01.htm History of LEDs - Chapter 1] at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hewlett Packard]].

Several watch manufacturers have made calculator watches over the years, such as Pulsar and Timex, but the [[Japan]]ese electronics company [[Casio]] produced the largest variety of models. In the mid-1980s, Casio created the [[Casio Databank|Databank]] calculator watch, which not only performed calculator functions, but also stored appointments, names, addresses, and phone numbers.

Mass-produced calculator watches appeared in the early 1980s, with the most being produced in the middle of the decade,

== Future ==

The future of the calculator watch as a practical and useful electronic device has been impacted by the introduction of [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, and other powerful multi-functional compact computing devices. As a result, many calculator watches are used for aesthetic purposes.

== See also ==
*[[Nelsonic game watch]] - Multipurpose wrist-watches allowing the wearer to play micro video games, these units were the technological descendants of the calculator watch and were patented under calculator watch patents.
*[[Smartwatch]]es introduced in the 2010s are similar to calculator watches in both aesthetics and functionality, even though far more advanced in capabilities.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''call-second''' is a unit used to measure [[communication]]s [[traffic]] density. 

''Note 1:''  A [[telephone call|call]]-second is equivalent to 1 call with a duration of 1 second.  

''Note 2:''  One [[User (telecommunications)|user]] making two 75-second calls is equivalent to two users each making one 75-second call. Each case produces 150 call-seconds of traffic. 

''Note 3:''  The acronym CCS ([[Centum Call Seconds]]) is often used to describe 100 call-seconds.

''Note 4:''  3600 call-seconds = 36 CCS = 1 call-hour. 

''Note 5:''  3600 call-seconds per hour = 36 CCS per hour = 1 call-hour per hour = 1 [[erlang unit|erlang]] = 1 traffic unit.

In a communication network, a trunk (link) can carry numerous concurrent calls by means of multiplexing. Hence a particular number of CCS can be carried in infinitely many ways as calls are established and cleared over time.  For example 3600 could be one call for an hour, or 2 (possibly concurrent) calls for half an hour each.  CCS gives a measure of the average number of concurrent calls (i.e. Erlangs) over a time period of one hour.

Hence, in a one-hour period:
 1 CCS = 100 Call-Seconds = 1/36 erlangs.

[[Image:Camalot number 6.JPG|thumb|A #6 Camalot C4 placed in a crack.]]
[[File:Climbing gear - Camalot cams - 04.jpg|thumb|#1-#5 Camalots from around 2000]]
'''Camalot''', or '''cam''', is a brand of [[spring-loaded camming device]]s, manufactured by [[Black Diamond Equipment]], Ltd. 

The device is used in cracks to secure ropes while [[rock climbing]].

There are two types of Camalots, those with four lobes (original Camalots and modern C4 models) and those with three lobes (Camalot C3s). The original Camalots and the C4s utilize a [[patent]]ed dual-axle cam system, resulting in a slightly higher expansion range than for a similarly sized single axle unit, and also resulting in increased strength, allowing placement as a passive [[nut (climbing)|stopper]]. C4s range from the small #0.3, to the rarely seen massive #6.

Black Diamond has also announced the Camalot X4,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climberism.com/gear-talk-new-black-diamond-camalot-x4/&lt;/ref&gt; which have a flexible cable stem similar to Aliens or Metolius Master cams. The X4 were released in Spring 2013.

C3s are single axle units designed for smaller, narrower placements, and range from a tiny #000 to #2.  There is some overlap between the C4 #0.3 and the C3 1 and 2. As with most microcams, the C3 #000 is rated for [[aid climbing]] only.

Camalot lobes were designed to have a [[logarithmic spiral]] shape, resulting in a constant angle between the cam and the rock at each contact point; this constant angle is designed to always provide the necessary friction to hold a cam in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.duke.edu/~mak25/research.html# |title=Duke SLCD research |access-date=2008-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025052215/http://www.duke.edu/~mak25/research.html# |archive-date=2008-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''canoe pack''', also known as a '''portage pack''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stiles |first1=Ed |title=Searching for the Ultimate Canoe Pack |url=http://bwca.cc/tripplanning/equipment/canoepacks.htm |website=bwca.cc |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a specialized type of [[backpack]] used primarily where travel is largely by water punctuated by [[portage]]s where the gear needs to be carried over land.&lt;ref name=furtman1992&gt;{{cite book |last1=Furtman |first1=Michael |title=Canoe Country Camping: Wilderness Skills for the Boundary Waters and Quetico |date=1992 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |isbn=9781452906676}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When worn, a canoe pack must ride below the level of the shoulders in order to accommodate the wearing also carrying a canoe. Their shallow stature typically has a lower center of gravity than a normal [[Hiking_equipment#Carrying_methods_and_capacity|hiking backpack]], making storage in a canoe more stable.&lt;ref name=furtman1992/&gt;

A typical pack weight while portaging was {{convert|160|-|200|lb|kg}} during the [[North American fur trade]] era.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Woolworth |first=Alan R. |date=1993 |title=An historical study of the Grand Portage, Grand Portage National Monument, Minnesota |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|url=http://www.npshistory.com/publications/grpo/historical-study.pdf |access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to support the heavy load of the pack(s), canoe packs are sometimes used in conjunction with a "[[tumpline]]" or "portage collar," a strap attached to the pack and placed over the top of the head.&lt;ref name=conover1991&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conover |first1=Garrett |title=Beyond the paddle: a canoeists' guide to expedition skills: poling, lining, portaging and maneuvering through ice |date=1991 |publisher=Old Bridge Press |isbn=9780921820291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portage packs lack many features of long distance hiking backpacks, and so are generally not used for such.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5383">'''Cel-Fi''' is a device, similar to a [[cellular repeater]], designed to eliminate in-building [[dead zone (cell phone)|dead zone]]s and improve indoor [[mobile phone]] reception.

Created by [[Nextivity, Inc.]], the Cel-Fi systems are designed with smart antenna technology to seek out the best available [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] to maximize signal gain to phone users. The Cel-Fi consists of two wireless devices, a window unit and coverage unit, that work jointly to increase [[3G]] and [[4G]] [[mobile broadband]] connectivity throughout the building. The window unit receives the signal and relays it to the receiver, which converts it and amplifies it.

These units were trialled for a period of time in both the US and UK by [[T-Mobile]], and approved in UK by [[T-Mobile]] and [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]] in 2011 and [[O2 (UK)|O2]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="Cel-Fi"&gt;{{cite web

Cel-Fi systems are comparable to [[cellular repeaters]] and [[femtocell]] technology. In October 2012 the Cel-Fi system was the first and only signal boosting device to be approved for use in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-offers-signal-boost--at-a-price-20120706-21l5f.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully compliant under the February 2013 Safe Harbor 2 issued by the FCC: On February 20th 2013, the FCC released a Report &amp; Order, thus establishing two Safe Harbors and defining the use of “network safe” consumer boosters on licensed spectrum. The Safe Harbors represent a compromise solution between Technology Manufacturers and Wireless Operators. It is widely considered a landmark decision which was many years in the making.

Cel-Fi has an LTE/4G/3G product. It was launched in September 2014.

}}A '''cellular repeater''' (also known as cell phone signal booster or amplifier) is a type of [[bi-directional amplifier]] used to improve [[cell phone]] reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/3554602 |title=Global Signal Booster Market- Evolving Technology Trends and Industry Analysis|date=|publisher= |accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cellular repeater system commonly consists of a donor [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] that receives and transmits signal from nearby cell towers, coaxial cables, a signal amplifier, and an indoor rebroadcast [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://www.repeaterstore.com/pages/cell-phone-repeaters|title=Cell Phone Repeaters – What They Are &amp; How They Work|date=|publisher= |accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common components==
===Donor antenna===
A "donor antenna" is typically installed by a window or on the roof a building and used to communicate back to a nearby cell tower.  A donor antenna can be any of several types, but is usually [[Directional antenna|directional]] or [[Omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]].  An omnidirectional antenna (which broadcast in all directions) is typically used for a repeater system that amplify coverage for all cellular carriers.  A directional antenna is used when a particular tower or carrier needs to be isolated for improvement.  The use of a highly directional antenna can help improve the donor's [[signal-to-noise ratio]], thus improving the quality of signal redistributed inside a building.

===Indoor antenna===
Some cellular repeater systems can also include an omnidirectional antenna for rebroadcasting the signal indoors.  Depending on attenuation from obstacles, the advantage of using an omnidirectional antenna is that the signal will be equally distributed in all directions.

===Signal amplifier===
Celullar repeater systems include a [[signal amplifier]]. Standard GSM channel selective repeaters (operated by telecommunication operators for coverage of large areas and big buildings) have output power around 2&amp;nbsp;W, high power repeaters have output power around 10&amp;nbsp;W.  The power gain is calculated by the following equation:
:: &lt;math&gt;
\quad P_\mathrm{dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{P}{P_0} \right) \ 
&lt;/math&gt;
A repeater needs to secure sufficient isolation between the donor and the service antenna. When the isolation is lower than actual gain plus a margin (of typically 5–15&amp;nbsp;dB), the repeater may go into in loop oscillation.  This oscillation can cause interference to the cellular network.

The isolation may be improved by antenna type selection in a macro environment, which involves adjusting the angle between the donor and service antennas (ideally 180°), space separation (typically the vertical distance in the case of the tower installation between donor and service antenna is several meters), insertion into an attenuating environment (e.g. installing a metal mesh between donor and service antennas), and/or reduction of reflections (no near obstacles in front of the donor antenna such as trees or buildings).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Isolation can be also improved by integrated feature called ICE (interference cancellation equipment) offered in some products (e.g., NodeG, RFWindow). Activation of this feature has a negative impact on internal delay (higher delay =&gt; approximately +5&amp;nbsp;μs up to standard rep. delay) and consequently a shorter radius from donor site.  Amplification and filtering introduce a delay (typically between 5 and 15&amp;nbsp;μs), depending on the type of repeater and features used.  Additional distance also adds propagation delay.

==Reasons for weak signal==
===Rural areas===
In many rural areas the housing density is too low to make construction of a new [[base station]] commercially viable.  Installing a home cellular repeater may remedy this.  In flat rural areas the signal is unlikely to suffer from [[multipath interference]].  

===Building construction material===
Certain construction materials can attenuate cell phone signal strength. Older buildings, such as churches, often block celullar signals. Any building that has a significant thickness of concrete, or a large amount of metal used in its construction, will attenuate the signal. Concrete floors are often poured onto a metal pan, which completely blocks most radio signals. Some solid foam insulation and some fiberglass insulation used in roofs or exterior walls have foil backing, which can reduce transmittance. Energy efficient windows and metal window screens are also very effective at blocking radio signals. Some materials have peaks in their [[absorption spectra]], which decrease signal strength.

===Building size===
Large buildings, such as warehouses, hospitals, and factories, often lack cellular reception. Low signal strength also tends to occur in underground areas (such as basements, and in shops and restaurants located towards the centre of [[shopping mall]]s).  In these cases, an external antenna is usually used.

===Multipath interference===
Even in urban areas (which usually have strong cellular signals throughout), there may be [[Dead zone (cell phone)|dead zones]] caused by [[destructive interference]] of waves.  These usually have an area of a few blocks and will usually only affect one of the two frequency ranges used by cell phones. This happens because different wavelengths of the different frequencies interfere destructively at different points. [[Directional antenna]]s can be helpful at overcoming this issue since they may be used to select a single path from several (see [[Multipath interference]] for more details).

===Diffraction and general attenuation===
The longer [[wavelengths]] have the advantage of diffracting more, and so line of sight is not as necessary to obtain a good signal.  Because the frequencies that cell phones use are too high to reflect off the [[ionosphere]] as [[shortwave radio]] waves do, cell phone waves cannot travel via the ionosphere.  (See [[Diffraction]] and [[Attenuation]] for more details).

==Different operating frequencies==
Repeaters are available for all of the [[GSM frequency bands]]. Some repeaters will handle different types of networks (such as multi-mode GSM and [[UMTS]]).  Repeater systems are available for certain [[Satellite phone]] systems, allowing these to be used indoors without a clear line of sight to the satellite.

==Approval in the USA by the FCC==
It used to be legal to use the low power devices available for home and small scale use in commercial areas (offices, shops, bars, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/index.do?document=305599|title=FCC ruling on cellular repeaters|date=|publisher=The Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2013, the [http://www.fcc.gov/document/use-and-design-signal-boosters-report-and-order FCC released a Report &amp; Order], thus establishing two Safe Harbors and defining the use of "network safe" consumer boosters on licensed spectrum. The Safe Harbors represent a compromise solution between Technology Manufacturers and Wireless Operators. Only a few companies have a product compatible with the new FCC regulations.

'''The FCC has defined two types of repeaters:'''

# Wide-band (or broadband) signal boosters are usually repeaters that amplify all frequencies from cell phone carriers. Because interferences can be generated from such boosters, the manufacturers who apply to the FCC must limit their gain (among other things), to 65&amp;nbsp;dB (for the low LTE 700MHz bands) to 72&amp;nbsp;dB (for higher frequencies such as AWS). By limiting the system gain, such boosters are only useful when the outdoor signal is relatively high, and need a complex outdoor installation of specific antennas.
# Carrier specific (or provider specific) signal boosters. These boosters are only designed to boost those frequencies (and signal) that belong to a particular carrier. Usually, such carrier specific boosters do not produce interferences on other carrier's frequencies, and are allowed to have much larger system gains (sometimes 100&amp;nbsp;dB). In these conditions, such devices boost signal in a larger coverage area, and can still be efficient when outdoor carrier signals are weak, but are only boosting the signal for the carrier it is designed to operate.

These new rules by the FCC were implemented on March 1, 2014. Here are the [http://www.fcc.gov/document/use-and-design-signal-boosters-report-and-order rules].

==Approval in the UK by Ofcom and the UK market==
In May 2011, [[Ofcom]] stated the following:

Installation or use of repeater devices (as with any radio equipment) is a criminal offence unless two conditions are satisfied:

# That the equipment is CE marked, indicating that the manufacturer has declared that it complies with all relevant EU regulatory requirements, including the Radio equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (R&amp;TTE) Directive;
# That the use of the equipment is specifically authorised in the UK, either via a licence or by regulations made by Ofcom to exempt the use from licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/radiocommunication-licences/mobile-wireless-broadband/cellular-wireless-broadband/policy-and-background/repeaters-boosters/|title=Ofcom &amp;#124; Repeaters / Boosters / Enhancers|date=|publisher=Licensing.ofcom.org.uk|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Under WT Act 2006 section 1.15, the wireless act also allows an exemption if the device does not "involve undue interference with wireless telegraphy". This is expected to follow the US-style regulations where a mobile repeater must have protection built in against interference.

[[Ofcom]] stated that "Repeater devices transmit or re-transmit in the cellular frequency bands. Only the mobile network operators are licensed to use equipment that transmits in these bands. Installation or use of repeater devices by anyone without a licence is a criminal offence under Section 8 of the WT Act 2006."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/spectrum-enforcement/jammers/|title=Mobile phone jammers and cellular enhancers|publisher=OFCOM|work=OFCOM Enforcing the Radio Spectrum|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeaters operating in rural and less densely populated areas do not pose a quantifiable problem.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A '''dust collection system''' is an [[air quality]] improvement system used in industrial, commercial, and home production shops to improve breathable air quality and safety by removing [[particulate matter]] from the air and environment. Dust collection systems work on the basic formula of ''capture'', ''convey'' and ''collect''.

First, the [[dust]] must be ''captured''.  This is accomplished with devices such as capture hoods to catch dust at its source of origin.  Many times, the machine producing the dust will have a port to which a duct can be directly attached.

Second, the dust must be ''conveyed''.  This is done via a ducting system, properly sized and manifolded to maintain a consistent minimum air velocity required to keep the dust in suspension for conveyance to the collection device. A duct of the wrong size can lead to material settling in the duct system and clogging it.

Finally, the dust is ''collected''.  This is done via a variety of means, depending on the application and the dust being handled.  It can be as simple as a basic pass-through filter, a [[cyclonic separator]], or an impingement baffle.  It can also be as complex as an [[electrostatic precipitator]], a multistage baghouse, or a chemically treated [[wet scrubber]] or stripping tower.

== Types of systems ==
Smaller dust collection systems use a single-stage vacuum unit to create suction and perform air [[filtration]], where the waste material is drawn into an [[impeller]] and deposited into a container such as a bag, barrel, or canister. Air is recirculated into the shop after passing through a [[air filter|filter]] to trap smaller particulate.

Larger systems utilize a two-stage system, which separates larger particles from [[particulates|fine dust]] using a pre-collection device, such as a [[Cyclonic separation|cyclone]] or baffled canister, before drawing the air through the impeller. Air from these units can then be exhausted outdoors or filtered and recirculated back into the work space.

Dust collection systems are often part of a larger air quality management program that also includes large airborne particle filtration units mounted to the ceiling of shop spaces and mask systems to be worn by workers. Air filtration units are designed to process large volumes of air to remove fine particles (2 to 10 [[micrometre]]s) suspended in the air. Masks are available in a variety of forms, from simple cotton face masks to elaborate [[respirator]]s with tanked air &amp;mdash; the need for which is determined by the environment in which the worker is operating.

In industry, round or rectangular [[Process Duct Work|ducts]] are used to prevent buildup of dust in [[Process engineering|processing equipment]].

== Dangers of neglect ==
Proper dust collection and air filtration is important in any work space. Repeated exposure to wood dust can cause chronic [[bronchitis]], [[emphysema]], "[[Influenza|flu]]-like" symptoms, and [[cancer]]. Wood dust also frequently contains chemicals and [[fungi]], which can become airborne and lodge deeply in the [[lung]]s, causing illness and damage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="661">In [[telecommunication]], '''electromagnetic interference control''' (EMI) is the control of radiated and conducted energy such that emissions that are unnecessary for [[system]], subsystem, or equipment operation are reduced, minimized, or eliminated. 

''Note:''  Electromagnetic radiated and conducted emissions are controlled regardless of their origin within the system, subsystem, or equipment. Successful EMI control with effective [[Magnetic susceptibility|susceptibility]] control leads to [[electromagnetic compatibility]].

The '''FIDO Explosives Detector''' is created by  ICx Technologies, Inc. and is based on a proprietary technology developed by MIT called [[amplifying fluorescent polymer]] (AFP). The AFP technology was invented by 2007 [[Lemelson-MIT Prize]] winner Professor [[Timothy M. Swager]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/swager.html Lemelson-MIT Program: Inventory of the Week: Amplified Chemical Sensors], also
* [http://www.gizmag.com/go/7063/ Gizmag: Chemist Inventor 'Sniffs' His Way to Prestigious US$500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize]
* [http://news.cnet.com/Bomb-detection-innovator-wins-500,000/2100-1008_3-6172500.html  Bomb detection innovator wins $500,000]&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted for use in the FIDO explosives detector to detect trace levels of explosive materials. The product is so named because its level of detection is comparable to highly trained explosives detection dogs, the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] in [[Explosive detection|explosives detection]] technology.

The overall system of the Fido Explosive Detector included a component called the Fido XT Explosive Detector developed at the U.S. [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory|last=|first=|publisher=Army Research Laboratory|year=2017|isbn=|location=Google Books|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This sensor can be used for detecting traces certain vapors, including those of explosives. It could also be used for screening people, vehicles, or buildings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Jianjun|last2=Bock|first2=Wojtek|date=2013|title=Fiber-Optic Sensors for Explosives Detection|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/24e4/464a7d6d1f54a7e168a115867a56a83a7e00.pdf|journal=The Open Optics Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This lightweight system is based on a sensitive amplifying fluorescent polymer. It is used for detecting explosives, in various methods including direct detection or tethered sensing. Tethered sensing is when the system is mounted on a robotic platform, such as unmanned ground, aerial, or on underwater autonomous vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

[[Dr. Stephen Lee]] is credited with inventing the FIDO Explosives Detector while working at the Army Research Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research lab chief scientist gains presidential recognition |url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=978 |website=www.arl.army.mil |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

FIDO is designed for operation in either handheld, desktop or robot-mounted configurations, and has recently been integrated on to the iRobot [[Packbot]] and Foster-Miller [[Foster-Miller TALON|Talon]] as an explosives detection payload for EOD applications in both Iraq and [[Afghanistan]].  FIDO has won the U.S. Army Greatest Invention Award twice since the year 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/us-army-awards-for-top-10-inventions-of-2005-02378/ US Army Awards for Top 10 Inventions of 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/us-army-awards-top-10-inventions-of-2006-03378/ US Army Awards Top 10 Inventions of 2006] – Fido in IREDS configuration on [[iRobot]] [[PackBot]], also known as [[PackBot#Current PackBot 510 variants|Packbot 510 with Fido]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3059">The '''front panel data port (FPDP)''' is a [[Bus (computing)|bus]] that provides high speed data transfer between two or more [[VMEbus]] boards at up to 160 MB/sec with low latency.  The FPDP bus uses a [[32-bit]] [[Parallel communication|parallel synchronous bus]] wired with an 80-conductor [[ribbon cable]].&lt;ref&gt;Standard VITA 17-199x, VMEbus International Trade Association (VITA), http://www.vita.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The following interface functions are supported:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mc.com/uploadedFiles/Echotek_Series-FPDP-PMC-ds.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*FPDP/TM (transmitter master) - drives data and [[Clock signal|timing signals]] onto the FPDP, and also [[Electrical termination|terminates]] the bus signals at one end of the ribbon cable
*FPDP/RM (receiver master) - receives data from the FPDP [[Synchronization|synchronously]] with the timing signals provided by the FPDP/TM, and also terminates the bus at the opposite end of the cable to the FPDP/TM
*FPDP/R (receiver) - receives data form the FPDP synchronously with the timing signals provided by the FPDP/TM; it does not terminate the bus.  More than one FPDP/R can be connected to the FPDP bus.  It can also be an alternate function to that of FPDP/RM via software control.

The connector, denoted by the FPDP specification, is a KEL P/N 8825E-080-175.

==Interface signals==
* D&lt;31:0&gt; : Data bus driven by FPDP/TM
* DIR_n   : Active low Direction signal driven by FPDP/TM
* DVALID_n: Active low data valid indication driven by FPDP/TM
* STROBE  : A free running clock supplied by FPDP/TM
* NRDY_n  : Active low not ready signal driven by FPDP/R or FPDP/RM. Asserted before the commencement of transfer of data by the FPDP/R or FPDP/RM asynchronous to STROBE.
* PSTROBE : Optional Differential PECL version of the STROBE driven by FPDP/TM
* SUSPEND_n : Active low suspend signal asserted by FPDP/R or FPDP/RM asynchronous to STROBE to inform the transmitter that buffer flow condition may occur. The transmitter may delay not more than 16 clocks before it suspends the data transfer.
* SYNC_n  : Active low synchronization pulse provided by FPDP/TM.
* PIO1, PIO2 : Programmable I/O lines for user purposes

==Data frames==
The following types of data frames are supported:
* Unframed Data
* single frame Data
* Fixed size Repeating Frame Data
* Dynamic Size Repeating Frame Data

== Cable length==
FPDP interfaces work with up to a cable length of 1 meter when used in multi-drop configuration. They work up to 2 meter when using STROBE signal during point-to-point configuration. They work up to 5 meter when used with PSTROBE differential signal during point-to-point configuration.

==See also==
*[[VMEbus]] - a computer bus standard widely used for many applications and standardized by the IEC as ANSI/IEEE 1014-1987
*[[Serial FPDP]] - High-speed serial version of FPDP, that can be sent short distances over copper cables, or longer distances over [[optical fiber cable]].

The '''Global Technopreneurship Challenge''' is an annual international competition organised by [[The Technopreneurship Institute]] through which global challenges are addressed, including the 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering for the 21st century &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grand Challenges - 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering|url = http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx|website = www.engineeringchallenges.org|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.globalgoals.org/ The Global Goals]. The challenge is akin to the olympics of technopreneurship where participants from all over the world participate to address the selected challenges through technology and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = xGTC {{!}} Put your city on the world map|url = http://x-gtc.com/|website = x-gtc.com|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, cities from all over the world bid to host the year's Global Technopreneurship Challenge.

== About the Challenge ==
The Global Technopreneurship Challenge is run in two stages, the preliminary stage and the finals. The preliminary stage is carried out online via a massive open online course on [https://www.openlearning.com Open Learning] where participants form teams and participate in online classes and activities. During this stage the participants acquire the knowledge necessary to [[CDIO|conceive, design, implement and operate]] solutions that are technologically feasible, economically viable, desirable and environmentally sustainable. The teams with the best solutions will then be invited to the finals where they will be given a chance to pitch to academics, and industrial experts as well as investors.

The first challenge was held in Kuwait in 2015.

== Global Technopreneurship Challenges ==

=== Kuwait Global Technopreneurship Challenge 2015 ===
[http://kuwaitgtc.com The Kuwait Global Technopreneurship Challenge] 2015 was held from July to November. It was organised by [[Kuwait University]] in collaboration with [[Taylor's School of Engineering]] and [[The Technopreneurship Institute]].

The '''Hyderabad Information Technology and Engineering Consultancy City''', abbreviated as '''HITEC City''', is an [[Information Technology]], [[Engineering]], [[Health informatics]], and [[Bioinformatics]] campus in the suburbs of [[Hyderabad]], [[Ranga Reddy district]], India. Located 15km² from the centre of Hyderabad, HITEC City lies within the '''Cyberabad''' Development Area, now part of the [[Hyderabad metropolitan region]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy2013"/&gt;

== History ==
HITEC City was launched in 1995 as a joint venture between [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]] (L&amp;T) and the Andhra Pradesh government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Internet Society|authorlink1=Internet Society|title=OnTheInternet|date=1997|publisher=Internet Society|page=35|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0a9TAAAAYAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project outside the city limits when launched, included hubs in the suburbs of [[Madhapur]], [[Gachibowli]], [[Kondapur, Ranga Reddy|Kondapur]], [[Manikonda]], [[Nanakramguda]], [[Pocharam, Ranga Reddy district|Pocharam]], [[Uppal Kalan|Uppal]], [[Shamirpet]], and [[Shamshabad]]. The {{convert|151|acre|ha}} of land  was contributed by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City Profiles, India Tier 1 Cities|url=https://www.cityinfoservices.com/downloads/CityReports-Tier1.pdf|page=6|publisher=Cityinfo Services Pvt Ltd|date=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Project is being developed through its Special Purpose Vehicle, L&amp;T Hitech City Limited, a joint venture company of L&amp;T Infocity Limited and the then [[Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation]] (APIIC). HITEC City has emerged as the symbolic heart of cosmopolitan Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-today-survey-on-best-cities-of-country-hyderabad/1/251324.html|title=Hyderabad: Colossal Gloss in City of Boom|website=Indiatoday.intoday.in|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cyberabad Development Area (CDA) was established in 2001 to promote "the effective development of the areas around the HITEC City and surroundings". The CDA Master Plan was published that year by the Cyberabad Development Authority.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Loraine|title=The Politics of Economic Restructuring in India: Economic Governance and State Spatial Rescaling |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317937982 |page=128 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZoliAgAAQBAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-abstract"&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Administration &amp; Urban Development  Department – Hyderabad Metropolitan Development  Authority  –  Approval  of  Metropolitan  Development  Plan-2031  for  Hyderabad  Metropolitan  Region  -   Orders - Issued|url=https://www.hmda.gov.in/Gos/G.O.Ms.No.33,dt.24.1.2013%20(DMDP-2031).PDF|publisher=Government of Andhra Pradesh|page=2|date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 52 km² zone, neighbouring the residential and commercial areas of [[Jubilee Hills]] and [[Banjara Hills]], lies mostly within [[Serilingampally]], 15km from the centre of Hyderabad. The Cyberabad Development Authority was dissolved in 2008, its functions merged into the [[Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority]].&lt;ref name="AP-abstract"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3446">''' is a society of the [[IEEE]]. It is also known by the acronym '''IEEE CAS'''. In the hierarchy of IEEE, the Circuits and Systems Society is one of close to 40 technical societies organized under the IEEE's Technical Activities Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE Societies, Councils and Technical Communities | publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/societies/home/index.html | accessdate=2006-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [http://www.ieee-cas.org/ IEEE CAS web site], the field of interest of the society is defined to be
:''"The theory, analysis, design (computer aided design), and practical implementation of circuits, and the application of circuit theoretic techniques to systems and to signal processing. The coverage of this field includes the spectrum of activities from, and including, basic scientific theory to industrial applications."''

== History ==

The first meeting of the IRE Professional Group on Circuit Theory was on March 20 of 1951. After the IRE and the AIEE merged, the IRE Professional Group on Circuit Theory became the IEEE Professional Technical Group on Circuit Theory on March 25 of 1963. In 1966 the group changed its name to the Group on Circuit Theory, and in 1973 became the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/IEEE_Circuits_and_Systems_Society_History |title=IEEE Circuits and Systems Society History |author=IEEE Global History Network |year=2011 |publisher=IEEE History Center |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The Society organizes many conferences every year and operates local chapters around the world.  It coordinates the operation of several councils, task forces, and technical committees.

'''Joachim Radkau''' (born October 4, 1943) is a German historian.

== Life ==

Radkau was born in Oberlübbe, now [[Hille, Germany|Hille]], Landkreis  [[Minden]].  Son of a Protestant priest, he studied history in [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]], [[Berlin]] (Freie Universität) and [[Hamburg]] from 1963 to 1968. He was influenced e.g. by [[Fritz Fischer]]. His doctorate 1970 treated the role of German immigrants 1933-45 on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. From 1971 on he started to teach at [[Bielefeld University]].

1972 till 1974 Radkau wrote together with [[George W. F. Hallgarten]] a synopsis of German industry and politics.  His views about the role of [[Hermann Josef Abs]] in German negotiations with Israel led to legal claim of [[Deutsche Bank]].

Radkau received the venia legendi with a study about Rise and Crises of the German nuclear industry 1980.  [[History of technology]] and [[Environmental history]] are favorite topics of Radkau. Besides forestry and the role of environmental protection in the German history, including the Third Reich, Radkau researched as well the relation between Nervosität ([[Anxiety]]) and technical development in the German Empire, adding biographical studies about [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Max Weber]].

[[Image:Mammotome.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Schematic representation of a vacuum-assisted biopsy probe]]
A '''Mammotome''' device is a vacuum assisted breast biopsy device that uses image guidance such as x-ray, ultrasound and/or MRI to perform [[breast]] [[biopsies]]. A biopsy using a Mammotome device can be done on an [[outpatient]] basis with a [[local anesthetic]], removes only a small amount of healthy tissue, and doesn’t require [[Surgical suture|sutures]] ([[Surgical suture|stitches]]) because the [[Surgical incision|incision]] is very small. Mammotome is a registered trademark of Devicor Medical Products, Inc.

==Benefits of the procedure==
A definitive diagnosis of the breast abnormality can usually, but not always, be made. Most women who have had both a surgical excisional biopsy and a biopsy using a Mammotome device state that the biopsy using a Mammotome device is far less stressful physically and emotionally. Cancer that is first diagnosed by a biopsy using a Mammotome device can usually be treated with one operation instead of two.

==Risks associated with the procedure==
During the biopsy, most patients experience only mild discomfort. Rarely patients may experience significant bleeding or pain during the biopsy. Following the biopsy, bruising is common. Discomfort, tenderness, and bleeding at the biopsy site are all usually mild, but occasionally they are significant. Post-biopsy breast infection and other risks and complications rarely occur. Complications, from this biopsy or any other type of breast biopsy, can delay subsequent breast surgery. The metal marker sometimes attaches to breast tissue too far from the biopsy site to be useful as a future reference. Rarely patients may have an allergic reaction to the local anesthetic.

==Limitations of the procedure==
Lesions accompanied by diffuse calcium deposits scattered throughout the breast are difficult to target by stereotactic biopsy. Those lesions near the chest wall also are hard to evaluate by this method. If the mammogram shows only a vague change in tissue density but no definite mass or nodule, the x-ray-guided method may not be successful. Occasionally, even after a successful biopsy, the tissue diagnosis remains uncertain and a surgical biopsy will be necessary, especially when atypical or precancerous cells are found on core biopsy.

'''Network literacy''' is an emerging [[digital literacy]] that deals with [[computer network]] knowledge and skills. It is linked to [[computer literacy]] and [[information literacy]].

Network literacy relates to the basic knowledge and skills required for citizens to participate in the [[network society|networked society]]. Networking is become ubiquitous in the 21st Century and an understanding of network systems (such as the [[Internet]]) and network devices (such as [[smartphones]]) is vital for full participation in many modern societies.

The knowledge and skills normally associated with network literacy include:&lt;ref&gt;Digital Literacy Competency Framework, Scottish Qualifications Authority, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* uses of networks
* growth of networks
* value of networks (including [[Metcalf's Law]])
* operating principles of digital communication networks
* network safety
* network security
* online rights and responsibilities
* network performance
* implications for individuals, groups, communities and nations.

Network literacy may also embrace knowledge of [[social networks]] and [[personal learning network]]s. Behavioural protocols ("netiquette") are normally included.

The [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) will significantly extend the scope and reach of computer networks, and put greater focus on network literacy.

An important aspect of network literacy is the personal, economic, political, cultural and societal impact of the growth of networks on modern societies. Revelations by [[Edward Snowden]] illustrated the potential conflict between state security and personal freedom created by the growth of networking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">The '''Neyer d-optimal test''' is a sensitivity test.  It can be used to answer questions such as "How far can a carton of eggs fall, on average, before one breaks?" If these egg cartons are very expensive, the person running the test would like to minimize the number of cartons dropped, to keep the experiment cheaper and to perform it faster. The Neyer test allows the experimenter to choose the experiment that gives the most information. In this case, given the history of egg cartons which have already been dropped, and whether those cartons broke or not, the Neyer test says "you will learn the most if you drop the next egg carton from a height of 32.123 meters."

== Applications ==

The Neyer test is useful in any situation when you wish to determine the average amount of a given stimulus needed in order to trigger a response.  Examples:

* Material Toughness - how far does this type of bottle filled with detergent need to fall before it breaks?
* Drug Efficacy -  how much of this drug is enough to cure this diseases?
* Toxicology - what percentage of contaminated seed is enough to cause a bird of this species to die?
* Sensory Threshold - how strong does the light have to be for this photodetector to sense it?
* Damage Threshold - how loud does the sound have to be in order to damage this microphone ?

== History ==

The Neyer-d optimal test was described by Barry T. Neyer in 1994. This method has replaced the earlier [[Bruceton analysis]] or "Up and Down Test" that was devised by Dixon and Mood in 1948 to allow computation with pencil and paper. Samples are tested at various stimulus levels, and the results (response or no response) noted. The Neyer Test guides the experimenter to pick test levels that provide the maximum amount of information. Unlike previous methods that have been developed, this method requires the use of a computer program to calculate the test levels.

Although not directly related to the test method, the [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio analysis]] method is often used to analyze the results of tests conducted with the Neyer D-Optimal test. The combined test and analysis methods are commonly known as the Neyer Test.

Dror and Steinberg (2008) suggest another [[experimental design]] method which is more efficient than Neyer's, by enabling the usage of a [[D-optimal design]] criterion from the outset of the experiment. Furthermore, their method is extended to deal with situations which are not handled by previous algorithms, including extension from fully sequential designs (updating the plan after each observation) to group-sequential designs (any partition of the experiment to blocks of numerous observations), from a binary response ("success" or "failure") to any generalized linear model, and from the univariate case to the treatment of multiple predictors (such as designing an experiment to test a response in a medical treatment where the experimenters changes doses of two different drugs).

== History ==

=== Founding ===

The company is based on a research unit that was formed within [[QinetiQ]], an international defence technology company that was spun off from the former UK government agency [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] (DERA) when it was split up in June 2001.

One of the problems the research unit studied was the difficulty reading radio frequency identification (RFID) tags placed close to metals and liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F10171%2F32491%2F01516541.pdf&amp;authDecision=-203 |title=Environmental effects on RFID tag antennas, 2005 IEEE MTT-S International, Jun 2005 |publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pserie.psu.edu/outreach/rfid/Documents/RFIDresearchPSU.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Dewolf_Maloni_ResearchPaperFINAL.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, 2007, Omni-ID was granted UK patent number GB2429878 for an “electromagnetic radiation decoupler.&lt;ref name="ipo.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-os/p-find/p-find-number |title=United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office |publisher=Ipo.gov.uk |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a working RFID tag that overcame those difficulties, it was decided to commercialize the design by forming a new company, Omni-ID, Ltd., which was launched in March 2007. Initial funding for Omni-ID was provided by Cody Gate Ventures LLP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qinetiq.com/home/newsroom/news_releases_homepage/2007/2nd_quarter/qinetiq_launches_new.html |title=QinetiQ launches new technology venture fund in partnership with Coller Capital, Jun 27, 2007 |publisher=Qinetiq.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technology venture fund created in 2007 by [[QinetiQ]] and [http://www.collercapital.com/ Coller Capital].  An additional $15 million in Series C funding was provided to Omni-ID by Cody Gate Ventures in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS171059+09-Feb-2009+MW20090209 |title=Omni-ID Secures $15 Million in Series C Funding From Cody Gate Ventures, Reuters, Feb 2009 |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Products ===

The core principle of the new passive &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=47 |title=Technovlegy |publisher=Technovelgy.com |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; RFID tag design marketed by Omni-ID was that it contained a complex and proprietary &lt;ref name="ipo.gov.uk"/&gt; arrangement of metal layers within the tag which reflected and boosted the signal broadcast from an RFID reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Technology-Article.asp?ArtNum=54 |title=Technovlegy |publisher=Technovelgy.com |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the tag to be read accurately even when placed on metal, on a liquid container, or even when immersed.

The company offers five different tag designs: Ultra, Max, Flex, Prox, and Curv. Each has a different [[Radio-frequency identification|read range]], based on the trade-off between tag size and performance.

The Ultra tag has the longest read range in the Omni-ID product family; up to 135&amp;nbsp;ft. with a stationary reader.&lt;ref name="tmcnet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m2m.tmcnet.com/topics/m2mevolution/articles/64353-omni-id-launches-rfid-tags-manufacturing-transportation-defense.htm |title=Omni-ID Launches RFID Tags for Manufacturing, Transportation, and Defense Industries |publisher=M2m.tmcnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Max tag has a long read range &lt;ref name="rfidwizards.com"/&gt; and is designed for tracking conveyances and outdoor assets. The Max HD is a long-range global tag for use in all geographic regions.&lt;ref name="tmcnet1"/&gt;

The Flex tag is a thin, low-profile tag that offers a medium read range.&lt;ref name="rfidwizards1"/&gt;

The Prox tag is a small tag with a read range of 4m has the shortest read range &lt;ref name="rfidwizards2"/&gt; and is often used for tracking high value IT assets.

The Curv tag is a small, flexible tag for use on cylindrical assets.

In October 2008, the company announced a new product, OmniTether, designed to attach RFID tags to items that lacked sufficient surface area for normal attachment methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/print/4436 |title=RFID Journal, News Roundup, Nov 6, 2008 |publisher=Rfidjournal.com |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the company introduced their Service Bureau product, intended to simplify the RFID tag commissioning process for its customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS196433+14-Oct-2008+MW20081014 |title=RFID Innovator Omni-ID Unveils Service Bureau to Offer Flexible Tag Commissioning and Enhanced Customer Efficiency, Reuters, Oct 2008 |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omni-ID prints a barcode on the outer label, along with human-readable information, and commissions tags prior to shipping so they arrive at the customer's facility with inventory and associated EPC coding on each tag.

In November 2008, the company announced Omni-ID On Demand for their Prox RFID tag.  The two-part product allows customers to print, encode and deploy Omni-ID tags as needed. Omni-ID has applied for a patent on the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emqus.com/index.php?/emq/press_releases/omni_id_removes_barriers_to_rfid_adoption_through_a_patent_pending_on_site_deployment_solution_752 |title=Omni-ID removes barriers to RFID adoption through a patent-pending on site deployment solution, Enterprise Management Quarterly, Nov 17, 2008 |publisher=Emqus.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, the Ultra tag was introduced, a long range passive tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/view/5213 |title=Omni-ID Launches New High-Performance UHF Gen 2 Tags, RFID Journal, Sep 14, 2009 |publisher=Rfidjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benchmark tests by Martin Bjerre, RFID Global Solution, Inc., demonstrated a read range of 135&amp;nbsp;ft. with a stationary RFID reader, a record for a passive tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://awareinnovations.com/2009/09/14/omni-id-launches-new-rfid-manufacturing-transportation-product-suite/|title=Omni-ID Launches New RFID Manufacturing &amp; Transportation Product Suite|date=2009-09-14|website=Aware Innovations|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open Source Ecology''' ('''OSE''') is a network of farmers, engineers, architects and supporters, whose main goal is the eventual manufacturing of the '''Global Village Construction Set''' ('''GVCS'''). As described by Open Source Ecology "the GVCS is an open technological platform that allows for the easy fabrication of the 50 different Industrial Machines that it takes to build a small civilization with modern comforts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/gvcs.php "Open Source Ecology"], Accessed: 7-23-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]] are developing blueprints, and building prototypes in order to pass them on to Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rohan Pearce |date=2011-12-14 |title=Can open source save the planet? |publisher=Techworld Australia |url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/in-depth/open-source/3325167/can-open-source-save-planet/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Recently, 3D-Print reports&lt;ref&gt;http://3dprint.com/10110/3d-printers-economy/&lt;/ref&gt; OSE has been experimenting with [[RepRap]] [[3-D printers]] as suggested by academics for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M Pearce, C. Morris Blair, K. J. Laciak, R. Andrews, A. Nosrat and I. Zelenika-Zovko, "[https://www.academia.edu/1507915/3-D_Printing_of_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technologies_for_Self-Directed_Sustainable_Development 3-D Printing of Open Source Appropriate Technologies for Self-Directed Sustainable Development]", ''Journal of Sustainable Development'' '''3'''(4), pp. 17-29 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Marcin Jakubowski Ph.D. founded the group in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/about.php "About"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717072826/http://opensourceecology.org/about.php |date=2011-07-17 }}, Accessed: 7-19-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final year of his doctoral thesis at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], he had the feeling that his career field was too closed off from the world's problems, and he wanted to go a different way.  After graduation, he devoted himself entirely to OSE.

OSE made it to the world stage in 2011 when Jakubowski presented his Global Village Construction Set [[TED Talk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/marcin_jakubowski.html "Marcin Jakubowski: Open-sourced blueprints for civilization"], April 2011. Accessed: 7-19-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the GVCS won [[Make (magazine)|Make magazine's]]  Green Project Contest. The Internet blogs Gizmodo and Grist produced detailed features on OSE. Jakubowski has since become a [[Shuttleworth Foundation]] Fellow (2012) and TED Senior Fellow (2012).

In December 2013, Marcin married Catarina Mota.  She co-chaired the Open Hardware Summit 2012, served on the board of directors of the Open Source Hardware Association, taught as an adjunct faculty member at ITP-NYU, and was a fellow of the National Science and Technology Foundation of Portugal.

Catarina finished her PhD dissertation on the social impact of open and collaborative practices for the development of physical goods and technologies. She was a visiting scholar at ITP-NYU, Research Chair at the Open Source Hardware Association, TED Fellow, and member of NYC Resistor.

Open Source Ecology is also developing in Europe as OSE Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/OSE_Europe |title=OSE Europe |publisher=Opensourceecology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, OSE and the [https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/ Open Building Institute] joined forces to make affordable, ecological housing widely accessible. The initiative has prototyped the [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/622508883/open-building-institute-eco-building-toolkit/posts/1750160 Seed Eco-Home] - a 1400 square foot home with the help of 50 people in a 5 day period - demonstrating that OSE's [[EXtreme_Manufacturing|Extreme Manufacturing]] techniques can be apply to rapid swarm builds of large structures. Materials for the Seed Eco-Home cost around US$30,000. Further, OBI has prototyped the Aquaponic Greenhouse - which was also built in 5 days with 50 people: 

Image: not letting me upload my own image at https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/portfolio/aquaponic-greenhouse-workshop-2/ with caption ''Open source vertical growing towers with bok choi, lettuce, and other greens. Tilapia ponds under the towers provide nutrients as water circulates from the ponds to the towers. The ponds are 4 feet deep, making for a vertical biological zone 12 feet high to maximize productivity. The goal for the greenhouse is to experiment with the feasibility of producing a full diet for one person from only 800 square feet of space.''


== Factor e Farm ==
The '''Factor e Farm''' is the main headquarters, where the machines are prototyped and tested.  The farm itself also serves as a prototype. Utilizing the Open Source Ecology principles, Marcin and Catarina have built four prototype modules which comprise their home.  An added greenhouse demonstrates how a family can grow their own fresh vegetables and fish.  Outside there is also a large garden including fruit trees..&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Factor_e_Farm Factor e Farm Information] Accessed 7-31-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current progress==
As of 2014, twelve of the fifty machines have been designed, blueprinted, and prototyped, with four of those reaching the documentation stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Status_Brief Status Brief], Accessed: 2016-02-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/GVCS_Tools_Status GVCS Prototype Status], Accessed: 2016-02-14&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2011 a [[Kickstarter]] fundraising campaign collected 63,573 USD for project expenses and the construction of a training facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/622508883/global-village-construction-set |title=Fundraising |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=2011-10-10 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project has been funded by the Shuttleworth Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/marcin-jakubowski/ |title=Marcin Jakubowski |publisher=Shuttleworthfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a semifinalist in the Focus Forward Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/focusforwardfilms/semifinalists/51764445 |title=Build yourself. – Tristan Copley Smith |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2012-10-19 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poll Everywhere''' is a privately held company headquartered in [[San Francisco]], California.  The company, founded in April 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Brendan|title=Startup Poll Everywhere invented the technology to conduct real time polls through cell phones|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2008/05/startup-poll-everywhere-conducts-polls.html|publisher=Boston Business Journal|accessdate= 27 February 2013|date=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an online service for classroom response and [[audience response systems]].

== Origins and History ==

[http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffvyduna Jeff Vyduna], [http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1710135 Brad Gessler], and [http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=2517613 Sean Eby] were coworkers at [[Deloitte Consulting]] charged with giving internal presentations.  One day, to keep the audience awake, they decided to pull a text message "out of a hat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Brendan|title=Startup Poll Everywhere conducts polls through cell phones|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2008/05/startup-poll-everywhere-conducts-polls.html|publisher=Boston Business Journal|accessdate= 27 February 2013|date=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code was started in April 2007, and the online site launched in September 2007. During that time, Vyduna matriculated at the [[Sloan School of Management]] at [[MIT]].  On May 14, 2008, the company placed as a semi finalist in the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reidy|first=Chris|title=MIT $100K competition awards its top prize|publisher=Boston.com|date=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vyduna subsequently took a leave of absence when Poll Everywhere was accepted into [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] in mid-2008;  In 2010 the company moved to [[San Francisco]].

In September 2012, the company announced it had acquired competitors ClassMetric and TextTheMob&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wan|first=Tony|title=oll Everywhere acquires TextTheMob, ClassMetric|url=https://www.edsurge.com/n/poll-everywhere-acquires-textthemob-classmetric|publisher=edsurge.com|accessdate= 27 February 2013|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company ==
 
The company is managed by two of its cofounders:  Jeff Vyduna, [[Chief Executive Officer]]; and Brad Gessler, [[Chief Technology Officer]].

The '''Pro Scientia Medal''' was established in 1988 by NSSC, National Scientific Student Council (in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] OTDT, Országos Tudományos Diákköri Tanács), [[Budapest]]. Every two years 45-50 young Hungarian [[artist]], [[researcher]] and/or [[scientist]] gets it, who achieved remarkable results with their scientific work while at [[university]]  (primarily at NSSC conferences).

The prizes are awarded in 16 sub-sections, therefore the winners are from almost all discipline fields. There is a medal in the artistic and junior (for [[middle school]] students) field as well. Currently (as of April 2010) 519 people possess medals.

The winners are grouped in the Society of Pro Scientia Medalists (SPSM), in Hungarian as Pro Scientia Aranyérmesek Társasága (PSAT).

'''Ramsbottom carbon residue''', which abbreviation is RCR, is well known in the [[petroleum industry]] as a method to calculate the carbon residue of a fuel. The carbon residue value is considered by some to give an approximate indication of the combustibility and deposit forming tendencies of the fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kittiwake.com/Default.aspx/Page/KB/KB/29 http://www.kittiwake.com/Default.aspx/Page/KB/KB/29] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622175521/http://www.kittiwake.com/Default.aspx/Page/KB/KB/29 |date=2007-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The carbon residue of a fuel==
The Ramsbottom test is used to measure carbon residues of an oil. In brief, the carbon residue of a fuel is the tendency to form carbon deposits under high temperature conditions in an inert atmosphere. This is an important value for the crude oil refinery, and usually one of the measurements in a [[crude oil assay]]. Carbon residue is an important measurement for the feed to the refinery process [[fluid catalytic cracking]] and [[coker unit|delayed coking]].

==Calculation methods==
There are three methods to calculate this carbon residue. It may be expressed as Ramsbottom carbon residue (RCR), [[Conradson carbon residue]] (CCR) or [[micro carbon residue]] (MCR). Numerically, the CCR value is the same as that of MCR.
Sometimes the carbon residue value can be listed as [[residual carbon content]], RCC, which is normally the same as MCR/CCR.

For the test, 4 grams of the sample are put into a weighed glass bulb. The sample in the bulb is heated in a bath at 553°C for 20 minutes. After cooling the bulb is weighed again and the difference noted.

[[Image:Ruudjan kokke-1493756847.JPG|thumb|right|Ruud-Jan Kokke]]
'''Ruud-Jan Kokke''' ([[Velp, Gelderland|Velp]], 1956) is a Dutch designer who started his career in the mid-eighties and became known for his furniture, inventive objects, interiors and designs for public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/45464|title=RKD website}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has received numerous nominations and awards. He is married to the visual artist and jewellery designer Petra Hartman.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.petrahartman.nl {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709175642/http://www.petrahartman.nl/ |date=2017-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ruud-Jan Kokke studied at the Sociale Academie (College for Social Studies) and at the Academy of [[Artez|Fine Arts in Arnhem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bear.artez.nl/nl/who/students-alumni/|title=Bear Artez alumni}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered a designer in the tradition of [[Gerrit Rietveld]] developing his first chairs in his workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunstbus.nl/design/ruud-jan+kokke.html|title=Kunstbus}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he started his own label, Ruud-Jan Kokke Product &amp; Design. Since then his furniture has been produced by companies such as Metaform, Leolux, Spectrum Design Eindhoven, Kembo, Auping and Ahrend. His first interior designs date from the early nineties. In close cooperation with his partner, Petra Hartman, he has also designed various school interiors.

==Objects==
The Kokke chair designed in 1984, was first produced in series by Metaform in 1988 and can now be found in the permanent collection of the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stedelijk.nl/kunstwerk/814-kokkefauteuil&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of flexible slats and has a transparent and strong structure. The notorious TC museum stool from 1990 was made for Museum [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen|Boijmans]] Van Beuningen in Rotterdam and is named after Trees Coenders, who was looking for a lightweight stool that was easy to carry and also easy to stack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dutchbydesign.com/tc-stool{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now serving in several other museums and is collected by the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMa]] New York under the title “Wander” Stacking Stool.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moma.org/collection/works/3601?locale=en&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, in 1992, Kokke designed the Kokkestok, a walking stick which is easy to use because of the long curl, the stiff end and the rubber strip on the side.&lt;ref&gt;http://kokkestok.nl/&lt;/ref&gt; Several other furniture designs followed, often in commission, such as the chairs for the restaurant of the Province House in Groningen in 1991, the Next bed for Auping (1996) and the Ahrend Run sofa (2009). In 2013 he developed Zami, an ergonomically designed stool, in close cooperation with the orthopaedic surgeon Piet van Loon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cit web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/dft/ondernemen/grensverleggers/25234423/__Grensverlegger__Gezonde_kruk_ook__smart___.html#|title=Grensverlegger: Gezonde kruk ook ’smart’}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zamilife.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior design and design for public space==
In the mid-nineties interior and public space became increasingly important. Often this concerned the upgrading of squares and parks or the renovation of existing buildings, such as the City Hall Arnhem (2007/2008) and several local Rabobank buildings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.helldorferlasbedrijf.nl/stadhuis.html&lt;/ref&gt; With the new millennium Kokke started a series of interior designs for schools, such as Mozaïek College Arnhem (2001/2002), Het Stedelijk Zutphen (2010) and Canisius College Nijmegen (2016), and sports facilities, such as Olympiaplein Amsterdam (2008).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fritsnolte.nl/hekwerk.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SIAE MICROELETTRONICA''' is an Italian [[multinational corporation|multinational]] corporation and a global supplier of telecom network equipments. It provides [[Wireless network|wireless]] [[backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]] and [[fronthaul]] solutions that comprise microwave and millimeter wave radio systems, along with fiber optics transmission systems provided by its subsidiary SM Optics.

Company products are deployed in more than 90 countries worldwide. The company is headquartered in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], with 26 regional offices around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.siaemic.com/index.php/wolrdwide|title=Worldwide Subsidiaries|last=SIAE MICROELETTRONICA|date=|website=www.siaemic.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate history==

===1952–1970s: Origins and initial growth===
Edoardo Mascetti, after graduating in 1949 in Electrical Engineering at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]] and working as electronic designer for [[Siemens]], founded his own company and named it SIAE, acronym for Società Italiana Apparecchiature Elettroniche&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=YpQdfylmkWgC&amp;pg=PA674&amp;dq=siae+microelettronica&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=siae%20microelettronica&amp;f=false|title=Storia delle Telecomunicazioni|last=Cantoni|first=Virginio|last2=Falciasecca|first2=Gabriele|last3=Pelosi|first3=Giuseppe|publisher=Firenze University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-88-6453-243-1|location=Firenze|pages=674|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company manufactured measurement systems such as electro-mechanical testers, analog oscilloscopes, telephone system analyzers and signal generators. SIAE's sales volume in 1955 was 6.224.000 [[Italian lire]] and doubled by the end of 1957.

A 431A-model oscilloscope&lt;ref&gt;http://fonologia.lim.di.unimi.it/strumenti_scheda.php?id=47&lt;/ref&gt; by SIAE was also part of the synthesizer in the [[Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano]]([[RAI]]) until its dismissal on 1983 and is currently on permanent display with the original study equipment at the Musical Instrument museum hosted at the [[Castello Sforzesco]], [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;https://strumentimusicali.milanocastello.it/it/content/studio-di-fonologia-della-rai-di-milano&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Oscilloscope siae.jpg|thumb|SIAE Oscilloscope 431A (introduced in 1963) used for the synthesizer in the Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano|246x246px|left]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SIAE MICROELETTRONICA Headquarters Cologno Monzese.jpg|thumb|Company's headquarters in Cologno Monzese, approx. 1966{{deletable image-caption|Friday, 1 June 2018|PROD}}]] --&gt;
A few years after founding SIAE, Edoardo Mascetti co-founded in 1958 Microelettronica S.p.A., a company whose business was the design of telecommunication equipment for radio and landline systems and which was initially located in a basement in Milan. In 1963, the two complementary companies were merged into SIAE MICROELETTRONICA S.p.A. and the headquarters was moved to the nearby town of [[Cologno Monzese]], where a larger area was available to accommodate the new offices and manufacturing plant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The new company counted less than 50 employees and focused its business on telecommunication systems, which were rising thanks to the capillary diffusion of telephone systems in Italy. [[Analogue electronics|Analog]] [[Multiplexing#Telephony|multiplexing]] systems for telephone providers constituted the company's principal product; nonetheless, in 1963, the company began an active collaboration with [[ENEL]], italian provider of electric power, in order to create a supervision system for the national distribution network, whose successful outcome later fostered similar activities in northern Europe and specifically in Norway.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=January 2017}}

By the mid '60s, the company began actively promoting its products by advertising in technical journals as natural consequence of a growing business, thanks to its first large-scale commercialized radio [[transceiver]]: the 3-channel 3-B3 and later the RT450 (1966), capable of aggregating 48 channels into [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] band. The RT450 equipment was also certified by [[:it:Telettra]] under the commercial name H450 as fallback link for its high-capacity solutions. [[Power-line communication]] systems were also manufactured by the company in those years along with the first fixed and mobile communication terminals in [[Very high frequency|VHF]] band (1972) for vehicular communications (precurring modern mobile phones) and anti burglar alarm systems.
[[File:2.3GHz Modulator for RT12 radio transceiver.png|left|thumb|153x153px|2.3GHz modulator for RT12 transceivers, exploiting microstrip technology on [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] for connections and electromagnetic coupling for [[Electronic filter|filtering]] and [[Power dividers and directional couplers|splitting]] purposes (1978).]]
By 1973, a whole new internal division was created for the design of television broadcasting equipments (repeaters and transmitters) whose main customer was the national television company [[RAI]]. The first television products were based on thermo-ionic tubes though the improvement of [[Solid State Logic|solid state]] technologies soon replaced [[vacuum tube]]s. Similar improvements in printed board manufacturing made [[microstrip]] circuits a viable solution for increasingly-high [[microwave]] frequencies and in 1978 the RT12 radio equipment boasted the first direct-conversion 2.3&amp;nbsp;GHz synthesized modulator and could aggregate 120 telephone channels. In these years, the company manufactured the historical link to connect the Milan and Rome branches of the [[Corriere della Sera]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archivio.corriere.it/Archivio/interface/view_preview.shtml#!/NTovZXMvaXQvcmNzZGF0aW1ldGhvZGUxL0A1ODEzNw%3D%3D|title=Ingegnere e Partigiano, pioniere dell'elettronica|last=Manzoni|first=Franco|date=2004-06-02|work=|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|language=Italian|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The employees were about a hundred  though the company still remained a family-run business lead by the founder and a tight board of managers through the '70s. [[Computer-aided design]] of electronic circuits was approached and exploited to improve yield and reduce the design time especially for the critical high-frequency sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HxlGAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=siae+microelettronica&amp;dq=siae+microelettronica&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1697xnqjRAhVGGhQKHfN5CN8Q6AEIQTAH|title=Digest: 1978 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|last=IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques|date=1978-01-01|publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,|isbn=|location=|pages=88|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s-2000s: Digital and worldwide company===
[[File:RT20 radio transceiver by Siae Microelettronica.png|thumb|374x374px|RT20 digital radio transceiver, carrying up to 30 telephone channels and operating at 0.9GHz of [[Carrier frequencies|carrier frequency]] (1981).]]
The early '80s witnessed two intertwined aspects which boosted the activities: the digital revolution reached commercial radio links and the RT20 thus leveraged 4-QAM modulation in order to provide low-capacity links while the increased globalization opened up international markets and the company business expanded to Norway, Great Britain and gradually to Europe. A [[quality control]] system was soon implemented to meet and certify the improved production standards.

In partnership with then [[:it:Telettra]], the Company developed the multi channel radio network covering the national extents, named RIAM, for the national electric company, [[Enel]]. The radio equipments were governed by a [[microprocessor]], in the wake of the widespread usage of these new components which offered a huge range of new possibilities for coordinating radio components when compared to traditional dedicated circuits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the increased demand for traffic, higher frequencies were needed and in the second half of the 80's the company commercialized its 18&amp;nbsp;GHz radio transceiver with a capacity up to 2Mbit/s, based on specifications of [[Enel]]. A 13&amp;nbsp;GHz equipment with 4Mbit/s was instead first provided to the [[Mercury Communications|Mercury]] operator in the UK.

[[Thin film]] manufacturing techniques for printed circuit boards were adopted during the 80s by the company for its microwave products beyond 10&amp;nbsp;GHz with ad-hoc equipments and production lines (yellow room) and soon upgraded to chip-and-wire technologies in white rooms ([[clean room]]). Documents show the RT28 transceiver remained in service until 2008 in the Italian [[Aosta Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;https://appweb.regione.vda.it/dbweb/bandigara/bandigar.nsf/(vediTutti)/8D8D6BF7C43F41ACC125753700499C07/$FILE/Capitolato_appalto_ponti_radio_2008.pdf?openelement&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Split-mount RT28 radio transceiver by Siae Microelettronica.png|left|thumb|18GHz RT28 split-mount transceiver, capable of up to 2Mbit/s communication (1986)]]
In 1986 the Company introduced the "split-mount" configuration, where an indoor unit (IDU) is connected to an outdoor unit ODU. The IDU provides the network interfaces and carries out the [[baseband]] tasks while communicates with the ODU, usually by means of an [[intermediate frequency]], which is tasked of radio frequency up/down conversion and is connected to the antenna. The split-mount configuration is still currently in use in several modern radio products and the boost in sales at that time was recognized in the 1988 edition of Major Companies of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=bm4nAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=siae+microelettronica&amp;dq=siae+microelettronica&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Major Companies of Europe|last=Graham|last2=Whiteside|last3=Blackburn|publisher=Graham &amp; Trotman|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=402|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early '90s the diffusion of data services and SDH required higher capacities to be transported and in 1992 the Company provided its HS13 SDH equipment to the SIP telephone company (later become [[Telecom Italia]]) entering thus the market of high-capacity microwave radio links and introducing enhanced techniques to counteract non-idealities in the communication channel and the transceiver hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fourth European Conference on "Radio Relay Systems"|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers|year=1993|pages=238|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baccarini|first=L.|last2=Biscevic|first2=G.|last3=Chiesa|first3=F.|last4=Miletic|first4=A.|date=1993-10-01|title=Error-correction techniques and adaptive linearization in SDH radio|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/264018/?reload=true|journal=1993 Fourth European Conference on Radio Relay Systems|pages=238–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously, subsidiaries were opened in Latin America and Far East. To meet international standards for control and supervision of the increasingly complex networks of radio links, the Company developed its own [[Network management system]] providing a unified interface for all its products. One of the first versions of monitoring software was still in use as of 2012 for a [[:it:TETRA]] network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comune.torino.it/vigiliurbani/poliziamunicipale/struttura/comando/appalti/pdf/capitolato_servizio_progettazione_radio13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the production of television transmitters and repeaters was halted in order to focus the activities towards the core business of backhauling radio links. The increased volume of chip and wire components fostered the introduction of improved [[Cleanroom]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, upgraded to the 10'000 class. The Company further evolved internally to expand its business and offer the services surrounding the mere provision of hardware, such as network planning, assistance, installation and contributed to the activities of international standardization bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfZOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=siae+microelettronica&amp;dq=siae+microelettronica&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidgs-EoKjRAhXC1hQKHa_6BA84ChDoAQgdMAE|title=Report on the Activities of the International Telecommunication Union in ...|last=|first=|date=1994-01-01|publisher=The Union|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 90s the Company commercialized a family of products whose design was dedicated to the booming market of [[GSM]] [[Cellular network|cellular mobile communications]]. In 1999, the offer was expanded to support high-capacity SDH traffic and a number of multiplexing equipments were developed as well to address the increased complexity and demanded flexibility of network configurations and interfaces.

===Present day===
The Twenty-first century was inaugurated by the first direct collaboration and commercial relationships with China which in 2014 lead to a dedicated subsidiary, Siae Telecommunications Shenzhen Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.siaemic.com/index.php/worldwide/apac/china|title=China Subsidiaries|last=|first=|date=|website=www.siaemic.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first european subsidiary opened in 2002 in [[Paris]] while the first non-european branch initiated activities in 2006 in [[Bangkok]]. The production and assembly processes began transitioning from manual to automatic [[SMT placement equipment]] in the early 2000s to cope with a volume of 15'000 radios/year while the yearly sales in 2002 increased by 25.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Aziende di famiglia con una marcia un più|last=Vergnano|first=Franco|date=2003-10-25|work=Il Sole 24 Ore|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In partnership with [[Cisco]], the Company developed algorithms and dedicated implementations for adaptive bandwidth and adaptive modulation schemes, which allow to react to impaired communication conditions (such as rain) gracefully reducing the link [[throughput]] instead of temporarily suspending the communication (out of service). Such solutions, extensively relied upon for [[Microwave Transmission#Planning|network planning]], are currently standard in most modern point-to-point radio links for backhauling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/unified-ran-backhaul/white_paper_c11-728355.html|title=Microwave Adaptive Bandwidth Feature: Make Better Use of Available Bandwidth|website=Cisco|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the global migration from [[circuit switching]] towards [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[packet network]]s, the Company developed Full IP equipments in split-mount and full-outdoor versions and also dual native radios, supporting both [[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]] and [[Ethernet]] modes, whose popularity positively affected company's sales volume. To meet the ever-increasing demand for higher throughput without need for additional bandwidth, which is licensed at a price in most dedicated bands, frequency reuse dominated subsequent industrial developments and the adoption of [[Polarization division multiplexing|dual-polarization]] techniques was commercially proposed in 2007, when the company and [[Vodafone]] (Omnitel by that time) presented the paper "2xSTM1 frequency reuse system with XPIC" at the European Conference on Fixed Wireless Network Technologies 2007 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rossi|last2=Calia|last3=Nava|last4=Salvaneschi|last5=Agabio|last6=Cornaglia|last7=Ratia|year=2007|title=2xSTM-1 Frequency Reuse System with XPIC|url=http://web1.see.asso.fr/cdecrr07/papers/S4B.5.pdf|journal=Proc. 8th Eur. Conf. Fixed Wireless Netw. Technol. (ECRR’07)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to Full IP and [[XPIC]] equipment sales, the yearly production of radios hit 70'000 in 2011 while the sales income topped 180 million Euro &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reportaziende.it/siae-microelettronica_spa?anno3=2011|title=SIAE-MICROELETTRONICA - S.P.A.

The juridical literature reports of a litigation initiated in 2006 by NEC Corporation against SIAE Microelettronica over alleged [[patent infringement|infringement]] of several former's [[patent]]s in the courts of [[Milan]] and [[Munich]]. The case was closed in 2010 with a bilateral agreement to withdraw all infringement, nullity and opposition actions pending worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.eetasia.com/www.eetasia.com/ART_8800438490_499488_NT_b6f537a3.HTM|title=NEC files patent lawsuit vs. SIAE Microelettronica|website=archive.eetasia.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.siaemic.com/index.php/newsevents/news-archive/72-news-events/news-archive/138-nec-siae-microelettronica-litigation-settlement|title=NEC/SIAE MICROELETTRONICA LITIGATION SETTLEMENT|last=Laura|website=www.siaemic.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=qJ0nRwULEaAC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=patent+siaemicroelettronica&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zAF5e6sGWL&amp;sig=-K9PlFGhKY4O4bLAmer6pV3UbtM&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii9dGKxPfMAhWF1hoKHQZFBkoQ6AEIIDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=patent%20siaemicroelettronica&amp;f=false|title=The Patenting Paradox: A Game-based Approach to Patent Management|last=Gasnier|first=Arnaud|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Eburon Uitgeverij B.V.|year=|isbn=9789059722309|location=|pages=58|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not directly involved in antenna manufacturing, the Company and [[Polytechnic University of Milan]] patented in 2011 a dielectric antenna for mm-wave communications based on a novel design aimed at reducing the overall size, whose application targeted small [[Form factor (design)|form facto]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r radio equipments.&lt;ref name="2011 patent antenna siae polimi"&gt;{{cite patent| inventor-last =Magistroni| inventor-first =Claudio| inventor2-last =Cattaneo| inventor2-first =Oriano| inventor3-last=D'Amico|inventor3-first=Michele|inventor4-last=Gentili|inventor4-first=Gian Guido|inventor5-last=Oldoni|inventor5-first=Matteo| publication-date = 2011| title =Antenna dielettrica ottimizzata per trasmissioni a frequenze millimetriche| patent-number=MI2011A002141| url=http://hdl.handle.net/11311/646730}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visual impact of transceivers began in those years to earn importance for the deployment of urban links, where the existing environment should be affected as little as possible by [[Mobile station|access stations]] and [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhauling]]  transceivers with their [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]].

In 2013 the company entered the [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter-wave]] market with its full-outdoor transceivers in [[E band (waveguide)|E-Band]]. In 2014, the product portfolio included also [[V band]] radios for [[small cell]] backhaul and [[Non-line-of-sight propagation|NLOS]] solutions for urban communications which may benefit from exploiting reflections on buildings in order to increase coverage.

A '''silicon controlled rectifier''' or '''semiconductor controlled rectifier''' is a four-layer [[solid-state electronics|solid-state]] [[Electric current|current]]-controlling device.  The principle of four-layer p–n–p–n switching was developed by Moll, Tanenbaum, Goldey and Holonyak of [[Bell_labs|Bell Laboratories]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moll|first=J.|last2=Tanenbaum|first2=M.|last3=Goldey|first3=J.|last4=Holonyak|first4=N.|date=September 1956|title=P-N-P-N Transistor Switches|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4052177/|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|language=en-US|volume=44|issue=9|pages=1174–1182|doi=10.1109/jrproc.1956.275172|issn=0096-8390|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practical demonstration of silicon controlled switching and detailed theoretical behavior of a device in agreement with the experimental results was presented by Dr Ian M.

The name "silicon controlled rectifier" is [[General Electric]]'s trade name for a type of [[thyristor]]. The SCR was developed by a team of [[Power engineering|power engineer]]s led by Gordon Hall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Jack|title=The Early History of the Silicon Controlled Rectifier|url=http://www.semiconductormuseum.com/Transistors/GE/OralHistories/Gutzwiller/Gutzwiller_Page6.htm|accessdate=12 April 2014|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commercialized by Frank W. "Bill" Gutzwiller in 1957.

Some sources define silicon-controlled rectifiers and thyristors as synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Standard Handbook of Electronic Engineering, 5th Edition|last=Christiansen|first=Donald|last2=Alexander|first2=Charles|last3=Jurgen|first3=Ronald|date=2005|publisher=Mcgraw-hill|year=|isbn=9780071384216|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; other sources define silicon-controlled rectifiers as a [[Subset#Definitions|proper subset]] of the set of thyristors, those being devices with at least four layers of alternating [[N-type semiconductor|n-]] and [[P-type semiconductor|p-type material]].&lt;ref&gt;

SCRs are unidirectional devices (i.e. can conduct current only in one direction) as opposed to [[TRIAC]]s, which are bidirectional (i.e. current can flow through them in either direction). SCRs can be triggered normally only by currents going into the gate as opposed to TRIACs, which can be triggered normally by either a positive or a negative current applied to its gate electrode.

==Construction==
The silicon control rectifier (SCR) consists of four layers of [[semiconductor|semiconductors]], which form '''NPNP''' or '''PNPN''' structures, having three P-N junctions labeled '''J1''', '''J2''' and '''J3''', and three terminals. The [[anode]] terminal of an SCR is connected to the p-type material of a PNPN structure, and the [[cathode]] terminal is connected to the n-type layer, while the gate of the SCR is connected to the p-type material nearest to the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.daenotes.com/electronics/industrial-electronics/silicon-controlled-rectifiers-scr|title=Silicon Controlled Rectifier - SCR|date=2017-12-15|work=D&amp;E Notes|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An SCR consists of four layers of alternating [[P-type semiconductor|p-]] and [[n-type semiconductor]] materials.
[[Silicon]] is used as the intrinsic semiconductor, to which the proper [[dopant]]s are added.
The junctions are either diffused or alloyed (alloy is a mixed semiconductor or a mixed metal).
The [[Diffusion_transistor#Planar_transistor|planar construction]] is used for low-power SCRs (and all the junctions are diffused).
The [[Diffusion_transistor#Mesa_transistor|mesa-type construction]] is used for high-power SCRs.
In this case, junction J2 is obtained by the diffusion method, and then the outer two layers are [[alloy]]ed to it, since the PNPN pellet is required to handle large [[Electric current|currents]].
It is properly braced with [[tungsten]] or [[molybdenum]] plates to provide greater mechanical strength.
One of these plates is hard-soldered to a [[copper]] stud, which is threaded for attachment of a [[heat sink]].
The doping of PNPN depends on the application of SCR, since its characteristics are similar to those of the [[thyristor]].
Today, the term "thyristor" applies to the larger family of multilayer devices that exhibit bistable state-change behaviour, that is, switching either on or off.

The operation of an SCR and other thyristors can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled [[bipolar junction transistor]]s, arranged to cause the self-latching action:
:[[File:thyristor.svg]]

== Modes of operation ==
[[File:Scr curve.jpg|thumb|Characteristic curve of a silicon-controlled rectifier]]
There are three modes of operation for an SCR depending upon the biasing given to it:
# '''Forward blocking mode (off state)'''
# '''Forward conduction mode (on state)'''
# '''Reverse blocking mode (off state)'''

===Forward blocking mode===
In this mode of operation, the anode (+) is given a positive voltage while the cathode (&amp;minus;) is given a negative voltage, keeping the gate at zero (0) potential i.e. disconnected. In this case junction '''J1''' and '''J3''' are forward-biased, while '''J2''' is reverse-biased, due to which only a small leakage current exists from the anode to the cathode until the applied voltage reaches its breakover value, at which '''J2''' undergoes avalanche breakdown, and at this breakover voltage it starts conducting, but below breakover voltage it offers very high resistance to the current and is said to be in the off state.

===Forward conduction mode===
An SCR can be brought from blocking mode to conduction mode in two ways: Either by increasing the voltage between anode and cathode beyond the breakover voltage, or by applying a positive pulse at the gate. Once the SCR starts conducting, no more gate voltage is required to maintain it in the '''ON''' state.

There are two ways to turn it '''off''':
# Reduce the current through it below a minimum value called the holding current, or
# With the gate turned '''off''', short-circuit the anode and cathode momentarily with a push-button switch or transistor across the junction.

=== Reverse blocking mode ===
When a negative voltage is applied to the anode and a positive voltage to the cathode, the SCR is in reverse blocking mode, making J1 and J3 reverse biased and J2 forward biased. The device behaves as two reverse-biassed diodes connected in series. A small leakage current flows. This is the reverse blocking mode. If the reverse voltage is increased, then at critical breakdown level, called the reverse breakdown voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;BR&lt;/sub&gt;), an avalanche occurs at J1 and J3 and the reverse current increases rapidly. 
SCRs are available with reverse blocking capability, which adds to the forward voltage drop because of the need to have a long, low-doped P1 region. (If one cannot determine which region is P1, a labeled diagram of layers and junctions can help.) Usually, the reverse blocking voltage rating and forward blocking voltage rating are the same. The typical application for a reverse blocking SCR is in current-source inverters.

An SCR incapable of blocking reverse voltage is known as an '''asymmetrical SCR''', abbreviated '''ASCR'''.  It typically has a reverse breakdown rating in the tens of volts.  ASCRs are used where either a reverse conducting diode is applied in parallel (for example, in voltage-source inverters) or where reverse voltage would never occur (for example, in switching power supplies or DC traction choppers).

Asymmetrical SCRs can be fabricated with a reverse conducting diode in the same package.  These are known as RCTs, for [[Thyristor#Reverse_conducting_thyristor|reverse conducting thyristors]].

== Thyristor turn-on methods ==

# forward-voltage triggering
# gate triggering
# ''dv''/''dt'' triggering
#temperature triggering
# light triggering

Forward-voltage triggering occurs when the anode–cathode forward voltage is increased with the gate circuit opened. This is known as avalanche breakdown, during which junction J2 will break down. At sufficient voltages, the thyristor changes to its on state with low voltage drop and large forward current. In this case, J1 and J3 are already forward-[[Biasing|biased]].

== Applications ==
SCRs are mainly used in devices where the control of high power, possibly coupled with high voltage, is demanded. Their operation makes them suitable for use in medium- to high-voltage AC power control applications, such as [[Dimmer|lamp dimming]], power regulators and motor control.

SCRs and similar devices are used for rectification of high-power AC in [[high-voltage direct current|high-voltage dc]] power transmission.
They are also used in the control of welding machines, mainly [[Gas tungsten arc welding|GTAW (gas tungsten arc welding)]] processes similar. It is used as switch in various devices.

==Comparison with SCS==
A silicon-controlled switch (SCS) behaves nearly the same way as an SCR; but there are a few differences: Unlike an SCR, an SCS switches off when a positive voltage/input current is applied to another anode gate lead. Unlike an SCR, an SCS can also be triggered into conduction when a negative voltage/output current is applied to that same lead. 
 
SCSs are useful in practically all circuits that need a switch that turns on/off through two distinct control pulses. This includes power-switching circuits, logic circuits, lamp drivers, counters, etc.

==Compared to TRIACs==
A [[TRIAC]] resembles an SCR in that both act as electrically controlled switches. Unlike an SCR, a TRIAC can pass current in either direction. Thus, TRIACs are particularly useful for AC applications. TRIACs have three leads: a gate lead and two conducting leads, referred to as MT1 and MT2. If no current/voltage is applied to the gate lead, the TRIAC switches off. On the other hand, if the trigger voltage is applied to the gate lead, the TRIAC switches on.

[[TRIAC]]s are suitable for light-dimming circuits, phase-control circuits, AC power-switching circuits, AC motor control circuits, etc.

'''Softcoding''' is a [[computer programming|computer coding]] term that refers to obtaining a value or function from some external resource, such as a [[preprocessor macro]], external constant, configuration file, command line argument or database table. It is the opposite of [[hardcoding]], which refers to coding values and functions in the source code.

==Programming practice==
Avoiding hard-coding of commonly altered values is good programming practice. Users of the software should be able to customize it to their needs, within reason, without having to edit the program's source code. Similarly, careful programmers avoid [[Magic number (programming)#Unnamed numerical constants|magic numbers]] in their code, to improve its readability, and assist maintenance. These practices are generally not referred to as 'softcoding'.

The term is generally used where softcoding becomes an [[anti-pattern]]. Abstracting too many values and features can introduce more complexity and maintenance issues than would be experienced with changing the code when required. Softcoding, in this sense, was featured in an article on [[The Daily WTF]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Soft_Coding.aspx Softcoding] from [[The Daily WTF]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential problems==
At the extreme end, soft-coded programs develop their own poorly designed and implemented scripting languages, and  configuration files that require advanced programming skills to edit. This can lead to the production of utilities to assist in configuring the original program, and these utilities often end up being 'softcoded' themselves.

The boundary between proper configurability and problematic soft-coding changes with the style and nature of a program. Closed-source programs must be very configurable&lt;!-- but generally aren't! --&gt;, as the end user does not have access to the source to make any changes. In-house software and software with limited distribution can be less configurable, as distributing altered copies is simpler. Custom-built web applications are often best with limited configurability, as altering the scripts is seldom any harder than altering a configuration file. &lt;!-- Witness the scores of CMS systems that are so much harder to work with than a bunch of html files in www/data! --&gt;

To avoid 'softcoding', consider the value to the end user of any additional flexibility you provide, and compare it with the increased complexity and related ongoing maintenance costs the added configurability involves.

==Achieving flexibility==
Several legitimate design patterns exist for achieving the flexibility that softcoding attempts to provide. An application requiring more flexibility than is appropriate for a configuration file may benefit from the incorporation of a [[scripting language]]. In many cases, the appropriate design is a [[domain-specific language]] integrated into an established scripting language. Another approach is to move most of an application's functionality into a library, providing an API for writing related applications quickly.

==Other meanings==
In [[feature design]], softcoding has other meanings.
* [[Hardcoding]]: feature is coded to the system not allowing for configuration
* [[Parameter|Parametric]]: feature is configurable via table driven, or properties files with limited parametric values
* Softcoding: feature uses “engines” that derive results based on any number of parametric values (i.e. business rules in [[Business rules engine|BRE]]); rules are coded but exist as parameters in system, written in script form

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6573">The '''sound reduction index''' is used to measure the level of [[sound insulation]] provided by a structure such as a wall, window, door, or ventilator.  It is defined in the series of international standards [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16283 (parts 1-3) and the older ISO 140 (parts 1-14), or the regional or national variants on these standards.  In the United States, the [[sound transmission class]] rating is generally used instead.  The basic method for both the actual measurements and the mathematical calculations behind both standards is similar, however they diverge to a significant degree in the detail, and in the numerical results produced.

Standardized methods exist for measuring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/Portals/0/data/en/NTi-Audio-AppNote-Airborne-Sound-Insulation-Index-with-XL2.pdf |title=How to Measure Airborne Sound Insulation'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; the sound insulation produced by various structures in both laboratory and field (actual functional buildings and building sites) environments.  A number of indexes are defined which each offer various benefits for different situations.

==Weighted Difference level (D&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;)==

The most basic index is the Weighted Difference level D&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;. This index is defined by measuring in [[decibel]]s (dB), the noise level produced on each side of a building element under test (e.g. a wall) when noise is produced in a room on one side (or outdoors) and measured both in the room where the noise is produced and in the room on the other side of the element under test.

This measurement may be carried out by measuring the levels in [[octave]] bands, or in 1/3 octave bands. (the latter is normally used for most applications). The minimum requirements of the standards require for the frequency range from 100 [[Hertz|Hz]] to 3.15&amp;nbsp;kHz to be measured (16 {{frac|1|3}} octave bands). In some situations measurements may be carried out in the bands down to 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and/or up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.

The measured levels in each 1/3 octave band (or octave band) from the source room (or area) (S) are then compared to the measured levels in the receiving room (R), and the difference is taken (S-R). this produces a measured difference level 'D' for each frequency band in the measured spectrum.

To produce a single [[integer]] number the measured spectrum is plotted on a graph, and compared against a reference curve (defined in ISO 717-1 for airborne sound insulation, and 717-2 for impact sound insulation). The reference curve is moved in 1 dB steps until the total of the unfavorable deviations (measured points on the graph below the reference graph) is as close to 32 as possible but not greater than 32.

The value of the reference curve at 500&amp;nbsp;Hz is taken as the '''Weighted Difference Level, D&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'''
This is considered to be approximately equal to the [[A-weighted]] level difference which would be observed if normal speech was used as the test signal.

==Sound Reduction Index (R)==
The Sound Reduction Index is expressed in decibels (dB). It is the weighted sound reduction index for a partition or single component only. This is a laboratory-only measurement, which uses knowledge of the relative sizes of the rooms in the test suite, and the [[reverberation]] time in the receiving room, and the known level of noise which can pass between the rooms in the suite by other routes (flanking) plus the size of the test sample to produce a very accurate and repeatable measurement of the performance of the sampled material or construction.

==Apparent Sound Reduction Index (R')==
This is a field measurement which attempts to measure the sound reduction index of a material on a real completed construction (e.g. a wall between two offices, houses or cinema auditoriums). It is unable to isolate or allow for the result of alternate sound transmission routes and therefore will generally produce a lower result than the laboratory measured value.

The calculation method used to produce the Sound Reduction Index takes into account the relative size of the tested rooms, and the size of the tested panel, and is therefore (theoretically) independent of these features, therefore a 1×1 panel of plasterboard ([[drywall]]) should have the same R&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; as a 10×10 panel.

==Normalized Level Difference (D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)==
This is an index which is measured in field conditions, between "real" rooms. It is a measurement which deliberately includes effects due to flanking routes and differences in the relative size of the rooms. It attempts, however, to normalize the measured difference level to the level which would be present when the rooms are furnished by measuring the quantity of acoustic absorption in the receiving room and correcting the difference level to the level which would be expected if there was 10m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Sabine absorption in the receiving room. Detailed, accurate knowledge of the dimensions of the receiving room are required.

==Standardized Level Difference (D&lt;sub&gt;nT&lt;/sub&gt;)==
Similar to the normalized level difference, this index corrects the measured difference to a standardized reverberation time. For dwellings, the standard reverberation time used is 0.5 seconds, for other larger spaces longer reverberation times will be used. 0.5 seconds is often cited as approximately average for a medium-sized, carpeted and furnished living room. Due to not requiring detailed and accurate knowledge of the dimensions of the test rooms, this index is easier to obtain, and arguably of slightly more relevance.

Once the difference level or sound reduction index is obtained, the weighted value may be obtained from the corrected spectrum as described above from the reference curve.

'''Television Electronic Disc (TeD)''' is a discontinued [[video]] recording format, released in 1975 by [[Telefunken]] and [[Teldec]]. The format used {{nowrap|{{convert|8|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}}}} flexible foil discs, which spun at 1,500&amp;nbsp;rpm on a cushion of air. TeD never gained wide acceptance, and could not compete against the emerging [[Videocassette recorder|videocassette]] systems of the time.&lt;ref name="popular_mechanics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4255160.html |title=The 10 Video Formats HD DVD Will Meet in Heaven |accessdate=2008-03-25 |last=Derene |first=Glenn |date=2008-03-20 |publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325001330/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4255160.html |archivedate=2008-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially known as, "The Video Disc" or the Teldec Television Disc, TeD (Television Electronic Disc) was first announced at a press conference in [[Berlin]] on June 24, 1970. It was developed by a team from two German companies: AEG-Telefunken and [[Teldec]]. Program information was stored in the form of ridges in the surface of a thin, flexible foil disc, which was claimed to be sufficiently robust to withstand being played 1,000 times. The main technological breakthrough was the vertical recording method that reduced the track pitch to 0.007&amp;nbsp;mm, and increased the rotation speed to 1,500&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], making it possible to record 130–150 grooves per millimeter, compared with the typical 10–13 grooves on an audio disc. This increased the available bandwidth from around 15&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] to 3&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]]. The tracks were read by a pressure pick-up, which translated the surface of the ridges, via a [[piezo-electric]] crystal, into an electrical signal.
Tracking was controlled not by the pick-up resting within the walls of a groove, but by a mechanical coupling on which the pick-up mounting is supported. There was no turntable. The rotation of the disc at 1,500 rpm created a thin cushion of air between the disc and a fixed plate. Vertical movement of the disc was kept to within 0.05mm. Eight-inch discs could store five minutes of programming, twelve-inch discs about 7½ minutes.&lt;ref name="TerraMedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/video/ted_video_disc.htm |title=TeD video disc |accessdate=2008-03-25 |work=The quest for home video |publisher=Terra Media Archives }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
By autumn 1972, the name of the system had just been changed to TeD (for Television Disc) and the playing time of the eight-inch disc had been doubled to 10 minutes. TeD players were finally introduced on the West German market on 17 March 1975. Six labels offered programs: [[Decca Records|Decca]], [[Teldec|Teldec Intertel]], [[Telefunken]], [[Ufa/ATB]], [[Ullstein AV]] and [[Videophon]]. Within the first three months 6,000 players had been shipped to 2,500 dealers, and 50,000 discs were in the shops. [[Sanyo|Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd.]] of [[Japan]], which had been conducting similar research itself (but was by now also developing the [[V-Cord]] videocassette recorder), was granted a licence to produce a version that would play out in the [[NTSC]] television format and by the end of 1976 had devised a long-awaited auto-changer that took 12 10-minute discs. Also in Japan, General Corporation took a manufacturing licence in July 1976 with an expectation of coming to market in April 1977. A software consortium, Nippon Video Systems, was formed around the same time. By the end of 1978 Telefunken itself had adopted [[VHS]].&lt;ref name="TerraMedia"/&gt;

The '''Novel Construction Initiative''' ('''NCI'''), established in 2003, is an independent voluntary initiative established through the International Pipe Line &amp; Offshore Contractors Association.&lt;ref name="6th Pipeline Technology Conference"&gt;[http://www.pipeline-conference.com/abstract-database/item/67-iploca-onshore-pipeline-novel-construction-initiative], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The  mission of the initiative is to bring industry professionals together to improve the processes surrounding the laying of pipe, namely innovation in [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] methods &amp; technology, with the goal to improve efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and mitigate risk of accidents and injuries to those engaged in the construction process.&lt;ref name="IPLOCA"&gt;[http://www.iploca.com/platform/content/element/10477/NovelGroupOverallMissionStatement.pdf], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative was proposed in 2001 and formally adopted in 2004. The first Novel Construction steering session took place in Windsor with 60 participants from oil and gas companies, contractors, technical engineers and manufacturers. They met to establish new innovations and solutions to the industry’s current problems, and set the project priority list for the Novel Construction Initiative.&lt;ref name="6th-Pipeline Technology Conference"&gt;[http://www.pipeline-conference.com/abstract-database/item/1-bp-iploca-novel-construction-methods-a-business-case-for-innovation], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the first meeting the Novel Construction Initiative has evolved, and now includes seven working groups (Planning &amp; Design/Monitoring &amp; Control/Pipeline Earthworks/Lowering and Laying/Pipe Facing, Lining Up &amp; Welding (FLUW)/ External Corrosion Protection System (ECPS)/Risk &amp; Contracts (R&amp;C))

In 2009 the combined efforts of the different working groups were brought together in the Initiative’s first publication: ''Onshore Pipelines: The Road to Success''.&lt;ref name="RTS"&gt;[http://www.iploca.com/page/content/index.asp?MenuID=319&amp;ID=820&amp;Menu=1&amp;Item=28.10], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the Road to Success document was to review in depth all the phases of an onshore pipeline project, analyse the elements that lead to successful projects and draw from the significant project experience of the participant companies. A wide range of companies and individuals from oil &amp; gas investors &amp; owners, design companies, [[construction contractor]]s, suppliers and specialised subcontractors collaborated in a series of technical meetings and discussions over three years to ultimately produce a document intended for wide use in the pipeline industry. More than 100 persons from 45 companies participated in the preparation of the final document that was finally released in September 2009.&lt;ref name="RTS"/&gt;
The document is available to all interested parties, and has become a reference point for experienced engineers,&lt;ref name="Pipelines International"&gt;[http://pipelinesinternational.com/news/protecting_pipelines_in_mountain_areas/009326/], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; clients, contractors and people starting out in the pipeline industry.

'''Wescom Resources Group''' ('''WRG''') is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Wescom Credit Union]] that operates as a [[Credit Union Service Organization|CUSO]] headquartered in Pasadena, California, providing technology products and services to credit unions across the United States.

==History==
Wescom Resources Group was formed in 2002 as a CUSO of [[Wescom Credit Union]] in response to the growing needs of credit unions seeking similar technology products that Wescom Credit Union had developed for its membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.creditunions.com/connect/WescomResourcesGroup |title= Wescom Resources Group |publisher= Callahan &amp; Associates|date= |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the CUSO's products and services included Online Banking, Bill Pay, Automated Lending, and New Member Application.  Each of these leveraged Wescom's use of integration techniques to the Episys host financial system from [[Jack Henry &amp; Associates#Symitar|Symitar]], now a division of Jack Henry, Inc. In addition, the CUSO offered a hosted Service Bureau platform for some of its initial clients.

The first services Wescom Resources Group (WRG) offered to credit unions in the Southern California area was ATM Deposit Processing, with Kinecta FCU being WRG's first ATM Deposit Processing client in October 2002. {{cn|date=February 2018}}

In 2003, John Best joined WRG to lead numerous development initiatives related to the home electronic banking application, and by 2009 led the WRG development team to completing its first Mobile Banking app.  Wescom was among the first credit unions to deploy a native smart phone app on the then nascent Android operating system.  John formed the WRG Mobile Advisory Group consisting of a small number of prominent credit unions to foster additional collaboration between WRG and its clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cubroadcast.com/episodes/archives/03-2012|title= Financial Tech with Wescom Credit Union's John Best|publisher= Credit Union Broadcast|date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, John Best left WRG in pursuit of other business opportunities within the credit union industry and remains an active technology advocate and speaker in the industry.

Tim Dolan, after serving nine years as WRG’s president, including twelve years as a member of Wescom’s executive team, announced his retirement earlier this year.  As of March 2017 Kevin Sarber, who served as WRG’s original president for five years after its founding in 2002, has been appointed for a second term following Tim Dolan’s retirement with the current Board of Directors being Rob Guilford, Darren Williams, and Jane Wood.

WRG's developing technology and customer products earn approximately $12 million annually in license and service revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cuinsight.com/press-release/wescom-resources-group-exceeds-10-million-in-revenue-for-2013|title= Wescom Resources Group Exceeds 10 Million in Revenue for 2013|publisher= Credit Union Insight |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, WRG served approximately 260 credit unions with a variety of products and services including digital channel products, as well as a number of ancillary products which have since been discontinued – including Automated Lending, [[Remote Deposit]], [[Customer relationship management|CRM]], and a number of internal system programming and information processing utilities.

In 2014, the CUSO's management shifted its focus to a smaller subset of products and invested more heavily in digital online channels.  This resulted in a reduction to approximately 130 active customer relationships (as of July 2016), and an increase in revenue to approximately $12 million per year. Operating in the financial technology industry, also known as "[[FinTech]]", WRG competes with a large number of other entities, both publicly and privately held companies of various sizes.  In 2010, WRG formed a new partnership with Corelation, a new financial core to further develop product integration techniques in the credit union industry. Since the launch of this partnership, WRG has grown its Service Bureau platform, based on Corelation's Keystone host processing system.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Services==
Wescom Resources Group's flagship product, Symmetry eBanking, is an Online Banking, Mobile Banking and Bill Pay user interface that integrates with a credit union's host system to provide account access and transaction support. The two host systems supported are Episys, by Symitar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cutimes.com/2012/05/31/wescom-resources-group-upgrades-service-bureau|title= Wescom Resources Group Upgrades Service Bureau|publisher= Credit Union Times |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.symitar.com/More-From-Symitar/pages/VIP-Members.aspx|title= Symitar Vendor Integration Program|publisher= Symitar|date= |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Keystone, by Corelation.  In addition to host system integration, the WRG platform Symmetry integrates a number of ancillary service providers in check imaging, deposit capture, bill pay services, eStatements, lending, and [[credit cards]].

The majority of WRG products start as services offered through Wescom Credit Union to its members.  Once operational inside Wescom, those products are then made available to other credit unions through WRG.   Although WRG creates and sells products that support different operational areas at the credit union, in recent years the CUSO has focused most of its resources on digital channels that include online banking, mobile banking, and their ancillary services.

WRG also provides Service Bureau data processing to approximately 30 credit unions under the name Unitri.  In addition to hosting the credit union's core processing system (either Episys or Keystone), Unitri supports related areas including [[Interactive Voice Response]], item capture, document capture, document management, IT managed services, and other products.  Tellergy, WRG's most recent product, is an interactive teller station application that resides on a digital display device from [[Verifone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1337">During the height of the [[Cold War]], the '''White Train''' worked out of the [[Pantex]] plant in the [[Texas panhandle]].  This train moved [[nuclear weapons]] from the plant where they were constructed to numerous sites to support the [[United States|US]] nuclear program.  From 1951 to 1987 [[United States Department of Energy|The Department of Energy’s]] [[Office of Secure Transportation]] (OST) used the train to move the weapons by rail. [http://www.mbe.doe.gov/me70/history/August06.pdf]  The train became the focus for peace and [[anti-nuclear]] weapon activism in the west.[http://no-nukes.org/nukewatch/sp00samday.html] While the train's color was changed numerous times to avoid notice, it continued to be referred to by its original color.  After the last attempt to prosecute protesters who blocked the passage of the train failed, the Department of Energy began instead to move nuclear weapons by truck without public notice.[http://www.gzcenter.org/newsletters/october_1998/page5.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">'''Zara Spook 9260''' (1939–present) is a [[Topwater fishing lure|topwater]] type fishing lure. The lure is cast out and retrieved in a "walk the dog" fashion (side to side or zigzag motion). It is supposed to mimic an injured fish and comes in many different fashions but the most prominent is the minnow type. Any fish that takes its prey from the water's surface would be considered a targeted species with this lure.

== History==
The Zara Spook was first developed by the [[Heddon]] company as a wooden lure named the [[Zaragossa 6500]] series lures. In 1939 The plastic version was introduced and following the naming of other [[plastic]] lures Heddon  added spook to the name to classify it as a [[Plastic bait|plastic lure]].  The Zara Spook 9260 Series lures contained different types of hardware throughout their production. Heddon two piece hardware were the first hardware on the 1939 catalogued Zara Spook.  Later lures through the 1940s and 1950s had [[surface hardware]].  Later models contained [[bell hardware]] and moulded hangers through the 1970s. In the mid-1990s, a 4-inch long model with three hooks was introduced, and a smaller 2-inch model has also been developed for light tackle fishing. The Zara spook and spin off models are one of a few lures still marketed under the Heddon brand name by [[EBSCO]].
