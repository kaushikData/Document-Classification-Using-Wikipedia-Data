      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10689">'''AAA''' (pronounced "triple-A") is an informal classification used for [[video game]]s produced and distributed by a [[Video game publisher#Mid-size publishers|mid-sized]] or [[Video game publisher#Major publishers|major publisher]], typically having higher development and marketing budgets. 

In the mid 2010s the term '''''AAA+''''' began to be used to describe AAA type games that generated additional revenue over time in a similar fashion to [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]]s by using [[software as a service]] (SaaS) methods, such as [[Season pass (video gaming)|season pass]]es or [[expansion pack]]s.

The term is analogous to the film industry term "[[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]".&lt;ref name=AAA_PR&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg, Scott |title=The definitive guide: Videogame marketing and PR|year=2007|edition=First|publisher= iUniverse, Inc|location=USA|isbn= 978-0-59543-371-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "AAA" began to be used in the late 1990s, when some development companies started using the expression at gaming conventions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demaria|first=Rusel|last2=Wilson|first2=John|title=High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games |year=2002|edition=First|publisher=McGraw-Hill Osborne Media|location=USA|isbn= 0-07-222428-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]] (late 2000s) AAA game development on the [[Xbox 360]] or [[PlayStation 3]] game consoles typically cost in the low tens of millions of dollars ($15 to 20m) for a new game, with some sequels having even higher total budgets - for example ''[[Halo 3]]'' is estimated to have had a development cost of $30m, and a marketing budget of $40m.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | title = The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future| editor-first =  Peter| editor-last = Zackariasson | editor-first2= Timothy L. | editor-last2 = Wilson | year = 2012| publisher = Routledge |page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[whitepaper]] published for [[EA games]] (Dice Europe) the seventh generation  saw a contraction in the number of video game developing houses creating AAA level titles, reducing from an estimated 125 to around 25, but with a roughly corresponding fourfold increase in staffing required for game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/417770/triple-a-console-studios-declined-by-80-this-gen-says-ea-exec/| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130708122249/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/417770/triple-a-console-studios-declined-by-80-this-gen-says-ea-exec/| title  =Triple-A console studios 'declined by 80% this gen', says EA exec| archivedate = 8 July 2013| date = 4 July 2013 | first = Andy| last = Robinson |work = www.computerandvideogames.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the seventh generation, AAA (or "blockbuster") games had marketing at a similar level to high-profile films, with television, billboard and newspaper advertising; a corresponding increasing reliance of sequels, reboots and similarly franchised [[Intellectual property|IP]] was also seen, in order to minimize risk. Costs at the end of the generation had risen as high as the hundreds of millions of dollars - the estimated cost of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' was ~$265m. The same conditions also drove the growth of the [[indie game]] scene at the other end of the development spectrum, where lower costs enabled innovation and risk taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/09/economist-explains-15| work = www.economist.com| title =Why video games are so expensive to develop | date  = 24 Sep 2014| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the period of transition from seventh to eighth generation of consoles the cost of AAA development was considered by some to be a threat to the stability of the industry.&lt;ref name="cb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poly1"/&gt; The failure of a single game to meet production costs could lead to the closure of a studio - [[Radical Entertainment]] was closed by parent [[Activision]] despite selling an estimated 1 million units on console in a short period after release.&lt;ref name="cb1"&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.cinemablend.com/games/AAA-Games-Could-Lead-Mainstream-Crash-44200.html| title = AAA Games Could Lead To Mainstream Crash| work = www.cinemablend.com| first = William| last = Usher| year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Radical-Entertainment-Goes-Bust-Prototype-Franchise-More-44096.html | title = Radical Entertainment Goes Bust, Prototype Franchise Is No More | first = William| last = Usher| year = 2012| work = www.cinemablend.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft game director Alex Hutchinson described the AAA franchise model as potentially harmful, stating he thought it led to either [[focus group]] tested products aimed at maximizing profit, and or a push towards ever higher graphics fidelity and impact at a cost of depth or gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/pursuit-of-aaa-is-a-cancerous-growth-ac3-dev-6365381| archiveurl  =https://web.archive.org/web/20120309153142/http://www.gamespot.com/news/pursuit-of-aaa-is-a-cancerous-growth-ac3-dev-6365381 |archivedate = 9 Mar 2012| title = Pursuit of AAA is a 'cancerous growth' - AC3 dev| first = Eddie| last = Makuch| date = 8 Mar 2012|work = www.gamespot.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[eighth generation of video game consoles]] ([[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Wii U]]) saw further increases in costs and staffing - at [[Ubisoft]] AAA game development involved 400 to 600 persons for [[open world game]]s, split across multiple locations and countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-02-26-on-reflections-first-interview-with-the-ubisoft-studios-new-md| title = On Reflections: First interview with the Ubisoft studio's new MD| first = Rachel | last = Weber | date = 28 Feb 2013 | work = www.gamesindustry.biz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire for profitability caused publishers to look at alternative [[revenue model]]s, where players continued to contribute revenue after the initial purchase, either by [[Premium segment|premium]] models, [[Downloadable content|DLC]], [[online pass]]es, and other forms of [[subscription]].&lt;ref name="poly1"/&gt; In the mid 2010s large publishers began a focus on games engineered to have a [[long tail]] in terms of revenue from individual consumers, similar to the way [[MMO game]]s generate income - these included those with expansion or season pass content such as with ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', and the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series; and those which generated revenue from selling in-game items, sometimes purely cosmetic, such as ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' or ''[[League of Legends]]''.&lt;ref name="aaaplus1"&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-25-weak-aaa-launches-are-a-precursor-to-industry-transition| title = Weak AAA launches are a precursor to industry transition| first =Rob| last = Fahey| date = 25 Nov 2016 | work = www.gamesindustry.biz }}&lt;/ref&gt; Titles of this type are sometimes referred to as "AAA+".

AAA game development has been identified as one environment where [[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch time]] and other working pressures that negatively affect the employees are particularly evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/282922/AAA_game_dev_lifestyle_is_unwinnable_says_veteran_game_designer_Amy_Hennig.php| title = AAA game dev lifestyle is 'unwinnable,' says veteran game designer Amy Hennig| date = 7 Oct 2016| first = Chris| last = Kerr| work = www.gamasutra.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://www.tweaktown.com/news/49863/ex-ubisoft-dev-reveals-grim-reality-aaa-games-development/index.html| title = Ex-Ubisoft dev reveals the grim reality of AAA games development| first = Derek| last = Strickland| date = 22 Jan 2016| work = www.tweaktown.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related terms ==
The console videogame industry lacks the equivalent of a [[B movie]], [[made for TV]], or [[direct-to-video]] scene. However, games with very low production costs that are not critically well received are sometimes referred to as "[[bargain bin]]" titles.&lt;ref name="poly1"/&gt;

===AAA+===
The term "AAA+" has been used by independent video game company [[CD Projekt]] in an attempt to promote their new content as being of a very high quality, despite being technically an indie game;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-11-18-witcher-dev-making-two-aaa-games-for-2014-15| title = Witcher dev making two "AAA+" games for 2014/15
| first = Robin| last = Purchese| date = 18 Nov 2011| work = www.eurogamer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; additionally the term has been used with a different meaning to figuratively describe AAA games with additional methods of revenue generation, generally through purchases in addition to the cost of the base game.&lt;ref name="aaaplus1"/&gt; In 2016, ''[[Gameindustry.biz]]'' described AAA+ games as products that "combine AAA production values and aesthetics with Software as a Service (SaaS) principles to keep players engaged for months or even years".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-09-final-fantasy-xv-and-the-last-guardian-the-last-of-their-kind| title = Final Fantasy XV and The Last Guardian: The Last of their Kind| first = Rob| last = Fahey| date = 9 Dec 2016 | work = www.gamesindustry.biz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general use the term "AAA+" may refer to a subset of AAA games that are the highest selling or have the highest production values.

===Triple-I===
'''''Triple-I''''' (or '''''Triple-i''''') has been used to refer to independently funded games (see [[Indie game]]) that meet an analogous quality level in their field; i.e., Indie games that are relatively high budget, scope, and ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url  =https://www.gamereactor.eu/articles/374623/The+Triple-I+Revolution/| title  =The Triple-I Revolution| first = Bengt| last = Lemme| date = 23 Jan 2016 | work = www.gamereactor.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url  =https://medium.com/@morganjaffit/indipocalypse-or-the-birth-of-triple-i-eba64292cd7a| title = Indipocalypse, or the birth of Triple-I?| date = 30 Aug 2015| work = medium.com| first = Morgan| last = Jaffit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was released on August 25, 2014 as the second official single from the band's fifth studio album, ''[[V (Maroon 5 album)|V]]'' (2014). It was written by [[Adam Levine]], [[Benny Blanco]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]; the latter is also the producer. The official Remix features [[J. Cole]] and another remix features [[Big Boi]], both written and produced by Freaky Ta, DCBC, and Aftermath artist Me3mo (Sameem Nadeem).

The song peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] giving Maroon 5 their tenth top 10 single in the U.S.

"Animals" was featured in the promotional advertisement of the 2015 [[Kia Soul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ssp1pdvT-A|title=2015 Kia Soul EV Hamster Commercial Featuring "Animals" by Maroon 5 – MTV VMAs|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|date=September 9, 2014|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the television shows ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tunefind.com/show/elementary/season-3/22511|title=Elementary - T-Bone and the Iceman|publisher=''[[Tunefind]]''|date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tunefind.com/show/dancing-with-the-stars/season-19/20416|title=Dancing with the Stars - S19 E11 Week #8|publisher=''Tunefind''|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was covered by [[Ice Nine Kills]], was included on the compilation album ''[[Punk Goes Pop Vol. 6]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leosigh.com/ice-nine-kills-version-of-maroon-5s-animals-is-even-better-than-original-video/|title=Ice Nine Kills Version of Maroon 5’s ‘Animals’ is Even Better Than Original (Video)|publisher=''Leo Sigh''|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked "Animals" at number 32 on its year-end list of the 50 best songs of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-best-songs-of-2014-20141203/jackson-browne-the-birds-of-st-marks-20141202|title=50 Best Songs of 2014|publisher=rollingstone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The music video was released on September 29, 2014 on [[Vevo]]. Directed by [[Samuel Bayer]], the video features [[Adam Levine]] and his wife, [[Behati Prinsloo]] who portrays the woman. The other musicians of Maroon 5 (including their touring member, [[Sam Farrar]], who appeared in a music video of the band for the very first time) also make an appearance - they are seen playing at a nightclub in some scenes of the video.

The video starts with a woman entering a slaughterhouse, where Levine's character works. After she leaves, an [[Infatuation|infatuated]] Levine begins to stalk the woman by following her in the streets and standing outside her apartment in the pouring rain to watch her. He also watches the woman in her sleep and takes numerous photos of Prinsloo  which he later trims and places on wires around a dark room. Intercut with this are scenes of a shirtless Levine dripping in fake blood, singing the song inside a meat locker and using animal carcasses for punching bags (referencing to ''[[Rocky]]''). One evening, Levine follows the woman into a nightclub, where he tries to talk to her. Though Prinsloo is amused by Levine and his interest in her, she spends the evening talking to her girlfriends instead. Eventually, Levine is left with no luck, so he goes back to fantasizing about the girl. After an erotic dream, Levine wakes up in a shock and returns to stalking Prinsloo by standing outside her apartment in the rain watching in a dazed state, leading to the similar opening. The final scenes feature Levine and Prinsloo as obsessed lovers kissing—whilst disrobed and covered in fake blood.

The music video was heavily panned by critics{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} and has been condemned{{by whom|date=August 2017}} for dehumanizing women and glamorizing violence.&lt;ref name="Guardian review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guardian|title=Guardian review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/01/maroon-5-animals-video-woman-adam-levine|website=Guardian|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite web|last1=Independent|title=Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/maroon-5-animals-music-video-attacked-for-promoting-sexual-violence-against-women-9770094.html|website=Independent|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jessica Valenti]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the video for attempting to make [[violence against women]] seem "edgy" stating that "there is nothing 'alternative' about showing women being stalked, hunted, raped or killed because it’s something that happens every damn day."&lt;ref name="Guardian review"/&gt;  [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network|RAINN]] (Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network) released a statement condemning the video, which wrote that  "No one should ever confuse the criminal act of stalking with romance. The trivialisation of these serious crimes, like stalking, should have no place in the entertainment industry."&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; Levine reacted to the controversy in a 2018 interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', saying "That was fucking ridiculous. It was the last video I would have expected to receive any criticism on that front. It was supposed to be creepy! I play the role of the creep, it's literally a character out of a movie. And the song is about animalistic tendencies, I'm talking about eating someone alive. Use your fucking imagination. It's like watching a horror film and notifying the people who made it to tell them you think they're disgusting. People are sometimes too rooted in reality and they can't differentiate. They take everything too personally."&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/adam-levine-interview-maroon-5-girls-like-you-video-noel-gallagher-the-voice-us-a8462946.html| last=O'Connor| first=Roisin| title=Adam Levine: 'I don't know what the f*** Maroon 5 are anymore... we occupy a weird space'| publisher=''[[The Independent]]''| date=July 25, 2018| accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chart performance==
In the United States, the song debuted at number 86 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. On October 18, 2014, the song rose from the number 33 to 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trust|first1=Gary|title=Meghan Trainor Leads Hot 100's Record-Setting All-Female Top Five|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6274312/hot-100-update-meghan-trainor-taylor-swift-iggy-azalea|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the band their tenth top-ten hit overall and their seventh consecutive Hot 100 top-ten hit since the 2011 chart-topping single "[[Moves like Jagger]]". The song reached its million sales mark in the US in November 2014.&lt;ref name=us_sales&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.yahoo.com/music/taylor-swift-replaces-herself-at-1-103075289246.html | title = Taylor Swift Replaces Herself At #1 on the Hot 100 | author = Paul Grein | work = ''Yahoo!'' Music | date = November 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song peaked at number three on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 issue dating November 22, 2014 and spent fourteen weeks in the top 10.

In other countries, the song has made the top-ten progress as well, reaching number 2 in Canada. It is also a moderate success in the United Kingdom, where it charted at number 27.

'''''Arena of Fate''''' is a cancelled free-to-play [[multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) video game developed by [[Crytek Black Sea]]. The game was announced in May 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/22/crytek-announces-arena-of-fate-for-pc-and-consoles|title=Crytek Announces Arena of Fate|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=22 May 2014|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; closed beta began on August 5, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waters|first1=Reuben|title=Arena of Fate Closed Beta Officially Begins|url=http://www.tentonhammer.com/news/arena-of-fate-closed-beta-officially-begins|website=Ten Ton Hammer|accessdate=8 March 2017|date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured five-against-five battles with legendary heroes from history and fantasy.

On September 17, 2016, studio director Vesselin Handjiev left Crytek Black Sea, along with his position as game director for ''Arena of Fate''. In 2017, Crytek Black Sea was sold to [[Sega]].

==Gameplay==
''Arena of Fate'' featured certain mechanics common to the MOBA genre - there were two teams, five players each, fighting over control of the map. The lanes have a series of towers that must be destroyed, and waves of AI-controlled minions make their way down the lanes toward the enemy base. Each player controlled a hero that can use powerful abilities.

Heroes gained gold as the match progressed and when enough gold was accumulated the players earned the right to acquire a new trait. To activate the new trait the hero needed only stay stationary and unharmed for a few seconds. Traits provided boost to max health, add lifesteal and have other similar effects.

When the match starts each player has to choose one of the seven hero roles. The role determines the player's position on the team. The Breaker role helps in the destruction of towers while the Keeper role helps defending them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feber.se/spel/art/307420/arena_of_fate_game_director_ve/?rss=true/|title=Interview with AoF Game Director Vesselin Handjiev|publisher=Feber.se|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the game is the twenty-minute time limit. There were three ways to win a match.{{explain|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worthplaying.com/event/E3_2014/E3_2014_June_11/92621/|title=Preview - 'Arena of Fate'|publisher=WorthPlaying.com|date=11 June 2014|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asghan: The Dragon Slayer''''' is a fantasy-themed [[hack-and-slash]] [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Silmarils (company)|Silmarils]] and released in December 1998. Players take on the persona of Asghan, a warrior prince who swears to avenge the death of his father by dragons. The game is praised for smooth integration of action and role-playing elements as well as a wide array of enemies and weapons. It suffers, however, from lacking character development and awkward controls.

==Story==
When the prosperous land of Brightmoon faces a pernicious threat in the form of dragons invading from the neighboring Isle of Kyrk, the warrior prince Asghan begins a perilous journey to counter the attack. The dragons themselves are spurred along by the evil sorcerer Morghan. Asghan embarks on his journey both to avenge his father as well as protect his land.

==Gameplay==
''Asghan: The Dragon Slayer'' is characterized largely by [[Tomb Raider]]-esque physical puzzles (running, jumping, crawling) as well as typical fantasy elements such as spellcasting and [[exorcism]]. Apart from being agile and magically proficient, Asghan is also able to use a wealth of different weapons. He employs these skills in series of dungeons and arenas including but not limited to a ferocious female dragon's dungeon, a green dragon's dungeon, an iceberg, a forest, and a witch's cavern.

==Influences==
Like most modern fantasy franchises, ''Asghan: The Dragon Slayer'' is littered with elements from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' story. Throughout the game, players encounter [[Hobbit]]s, [[Orcs]], [[Elves]] and great [[Eagle]]s resembling those in found Tolkien's works.

'''Barbette''' (December 19, 1898 – August 5, 1973) was an American [[female impersonator]], [[tightrope walking|high-wire]] performer, and [[trapeze]] artist born in [[Texas]] on December 19, 1899. Barbette attained great popularity throughout the United States but his greatest fame came in Europe and especially Paris, in the 1920s and 1930s.

Barbette began performing as an [[acrobatics|aerialist]] at around the age of 14 as one-half of a circus act called The Alfaretta Sisters. After a few years of circus work, Barbette went solo and adopted his exotic-sounding [[pseudonym]]. He performed in full [[drag (clothing)|drag]], revealing himself as male only at the end of his act.

Following a career-ending illness or injury (the sources disagree on the cause), which left him in constant pain, Barbette returned to Texas but continued to work as a consultant for motion pictures as well as training and choreographing aerial acts for a number of circuses. After years of dealing with chronic pain, Barbette committed suicide on August 5, 1973. Both in life and following his death, Barbette served as an inspiration to a number of artists, including [[Jean Cocteau]] and [[Man Ray]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Culme/&gt; (although it is sometimes cited as 1904&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt;&lt;ref name = Gewirtz198 /&gt;) in Texas. Most sources indicate he was born in [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]], although Barbette stated that his birthplace was Trickham.&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt;&lt;ref name = french /&gt;&lt;ref name = passport&gt;United States passport application for Vander Clyde Broadway, dated March 9, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; His Draft Registration Card, dated 7 September 1918, states that his birthday was 19 December 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Document viewed on ancestry.com on 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some confusion surrounds the name of Barbette's father. On a 1923 passport application, Barbette lists his father's name as "Henry Broadway" and notes him as deceased.&lt;ref name = passport /&gt; However, Barbette's death certificate gives his father's first name as "Jeff."&lt;ref name = death&gt;Texas Certificate of Death E950067, State file number 81205, for Vander Clyde (Barbette) Broadway. 1973-10-17&lt;/ref&gt; The death certificate lists his mother's name as "Hattie Wilson;"&lt;ref name = death /&gt; Barbette listed her name as "Mrs. E. S. Loving" on his passport application, as well as his 1918 Draft Registration form.&lt;ref name = passport /&gt;

In the United States Census of 1900, Barbette and his mother, Hattie Broadway (née Martin, 1879-1949), were living in Llano, Texas, in the household of his maternal great-grandparents, Florence E. and William Paschall, a farmer. Hattie, then aged 21, was listed as a widow on the census, while her son's birthdate is given as December 1897. Also living in the household was Hattie Broadway's younger brother, Malcolm Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;1900 U.S. Federal Census, accessed on ancestry.com on 10 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Hattie Broadway married, as her second husband, in 1906, Samuel E. Loving (1868-1953), who worked in a broom factory, and had five more children, sons Eugene Loving (1908-1971) and Sam Paschall Loving (1917-1996), and daughters Hugo Loving (1910-1912), Bonsilene Loving (born 1914), and Mary Martin Loving (1915-1997); after his mother's second marriage, Barbette was known as "Vander Loving".&lt;ref&gt;1910 U.S. Federal Census, accessed on ancestry.com on 10 January 2013. Hugo Loving's gravemarker states "Infant Daughter of S.E. and H.M. Loving".&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbette's mother took him to the circus at an early age in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and he was fascinated by the wire act. "The first time she took me to the circus in Austin, I knew I would be a performer, and from then on I'd work in the fields during the cotton-picking season to earn money in order to go to the circus as often as possible."&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt; Barbette practiced for hours by walking along his mother's steel clothes line.&lt;ref name = french&gt;{{cite news

  | date = 1953-10-15
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from high school at the age of 14.&lt;ref name = Gewirtz198 /&gt;

After high school, Barbette began his circus career as one-half of the [[Acrobatics|aerialist]] team The Alfaretta Sisters. One of the sisters had died unexpectedly and Barbette answered the surviving sister's ad for a replacement, auditioning in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].&lt;ref name = french /&gt; Together the pair decided that it was more dramatic for a woman to perform the acrobatic stunts.&lt;ref&gt;Kibler p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; "She told me that women's clothes always make a wire act more impressive...and she asked me if I'd mind dressing as a girl. I didn't; and that's how it began."&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt;  Following his time as an Alfaretta, Barbette next joined an act called Erford's Whirling Sensation. This act included three people who hung from a spinning apparatus by their teeth.&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt;

He then developed a solo act and moved to the [[vaudeville]] stage. He took on the name "Barbette", believing that it had an exotic French sound and because it could conceivably be either a first or a last name.&lt;ref&gt;Gewirtz, et al. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; His solo debut was at the [[Harlem Opera House]] in 1919.&lt;ref name = Cullen67&gt;Cullen, et al. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbette performed trapeze and wire stunts in full drag, maintaining the illusion of femininity until the end of his act, when he would pull off his wig and strike exaggerated masculine poses. For the next several years he toured the [[Keith Vaudeville Circuit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==The toast of Europe==
Barbette made his European debut in 1923, having been sent by the [[William Morris Agency]] first to England and then to Paris.&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt; He appeared in such venues as the [[Casino de Paris]], the [[Moulin Rouge]], the Empire, the Médrano Circus,&lt;ref name = Curlee&gt;{{cite web

He returned to America in 1924 to appear in ''The Passing Show of 1924'' which ran for four months beginning in September.&lt;ref name = Cullen67 /&gt;&lt;ref name = ibdb&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?ID=30846
  | accessdate = 2008-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this timeframe he became a featured attraction with [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] and toured London, Brussels and Berlin.&lt;ref name = Cullen67 /&gt; It was during an engagement at the [[London Palladium]] that Barbette was found engaged in sexual activity with another man. His contract was cancelled and he was never able to obtain a work permit for England again.&lt;ref name = Cullen68 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Gewirtz207 /&gt;

Barbette was championed by [[avant garde]] artist [[Jean Cocteau]]. Cocteau wrote in 1923 to [[Belgium|Belgian]] friend and critic [[Paul Collaer]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Next week in Brussels, you'll see a music-hall act called 'Barbette' that has been keeping me enthralled for a fortnight. The young American who does this wire and trapeze act is a great actor, an angel, and he has become the friend to all of us. Go and see him ... and tell everybody that he is no mere acrobat in women's clothes, nor just a graceful daredevil, but one of the most beautiful things in the theatre. Stravinsky, Auric, poets, painters, and I myself have seen no comparable display of artistry on the stage since Nijinsky.&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
To other friends he wrote "Your great loss for 1923 was Barbette – a terrific act at the Casino de Paris...Ten unforgettable minutes. A ''theatrical'' masterpiece. An angel, a flower, a bird."&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt;

In 1926 Cocteau wrote an influential essay on the nature and artifice of the theatre called "Le Numéro Barbette" that was published in ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]''.&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt; In this essay, Cocteau celebrates Barbette as an exemplar of theatrical artifice.

"Barbette," writes Cocteau, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;transforms effortlessly back and forth between man and woman. His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to a cloud of dust thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete that at the end of his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead ''plays the part of a man''. He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from foot to foot, mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act.&lt;ref&gt;Cocteau, Jean, "Le Numéro Barbette" quoted in Steegmuller&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  
Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.

[[File:Cone10-3-07-13s.jpg|thumb|right|Vander Clyde transforms into Barbette. Photograph by [[Man Ray]]]]
Cocteau commissioned a series of photographs of Barbette by the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artist [[Man Ray]], which captured not only aspects of Barbette's performance but also his process of transformation into his female persona.&lt;ref&gt;Lyford p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;  He also cast Barbette in his [[experimental film|experimental first film]] ''[[The Blood of a Poet|Le Sang d'un Poete]]'' (''The Blood of a Poet'') ([[1930 in film|1930]]). Barbette appears in a scene in a theatre box with several extras, dressed in [[Chanel]] gowns, who burst into applause at the sight of a card game that ends in suicide. He replaced the Vicomtesse de Noailles, who along with her husband had originally shot the scene but were appalled upon seeing the finished film, as the card game/suicide had been shot separately.

Speaking of his preparation for the scene, Barbette, who knew he was replacing the Vicomtesse, said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I tried to imagine myself a descendant of the Marquis de Sade, of the Comtesse de Chevigné...and a long line of rich bankers – all of which the Vicomtesse was. For a boy from Round Rock, Texas, that demanded a lot of concentration – at least as much as working on the wire.&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cocteau fell in love with the Barbette persona but their affair was short-lived.&lt;ref name = observer&gt;{{cite news

==End of performing career and later life==
Barbette continued to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report the year as 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942.&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt;&lt;ref name=Culme&gt;{{cite web

He became the artistic director and aerialist trainer for a number of circuses, including Ringling Bros. and the [[Shrine Circus]].&lt;ref name = french /&gt; His work with Ringling Bros. has been described as "reinvent[ing] the aerial ballet".&lt;ref name = Tait76&gt;Tait p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The Bird Cage Girls, The Swing High Girls, The Whirl Girls and the Cloud Swing Girls were among the female aerialist troupes whose routines were Barbette's specialty.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarstrom p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He created the circus sequences for the [[Orson Welles]]-produced Broadway musical ''[[Around the World (musical)|Around the World]]''.&lt;ref name = ibdb /&gt;

Barbette served as a consultant on a number of films, including the circus sequences for ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]])&lt;ref name = french /&gt; and ''[[The Big Circus]]'' ([[1959 in film|1959]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
  | title = 'Big Circus' Coming to Airport Drive-In
  | work = The Paris (Texas) News
  | date = 1959-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was hired to coach [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]] on gender illusion for the film ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959).&lt;ref name = observer /&gt; Cocteau biographer [[Francis Steegmuller]] wrote a profile of Barbette for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 1969 entitled "An Angel, A Flower, A Bird".  Barbette created the aerial ballet for ''[[Disney on Parade]]''&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt; and toured with it in [[Australia]] from 1969 through 1972.&lt;ref name = Tait76 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammarstrom p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbette spent his last months in Texas, living in Round Rock and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] with his sister, Mary Cahill, often in severe pain. He committed suicide by overdose&lt;ref name = Cullen68 /&gt; on August 5, 1973. He was survived by his sister Mary and a half-brother, Sam Loving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Cultural legacy==
In addition to Cocteau's essay ''Le Numéro Barbette'' and his appearance in ''Le Sang d'un Poete'', Barbette also inspired the characterization of "Death" in Cocteau's play ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orphée]]''.&lt;ref name = Gewirtz207 /&gt; The book ''Barbette'', collecting Cocteau's essay, the ''New Yorker'' profile by Steegmuller, Man Ray's photographs and other material, was published in 1989.

Barbette may have been the inspiration for the [[1933 in film|1933]] German film, ''[[Viktor und Viktoria]]'', which features a plot about a woman pretending to be a female impersonator, whose gimmick of removing her wig at the end of her act is "inspired by [Barbette's] signature gesture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1302">A '''canovaccio''' is a [[scenario]] used by ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' players. It consisted only of a list of acts and scenes; the details were left to the improvisation of the actors.  Actors in the ''commedia dell'Arte'' thus had to be endowed with an inventive mind since the success of the [[Play (theatre)|play]] depended largely on their creativity and above all on their ''[[lazzi]]'' (jokes and gags). The spotlight fell on the actors rather than on the play itself. 

The use of [[improvisation]] on top of ''canovaccio'' enabled the avoidance of [[censorship]] because censors cannot censor that which is not written.  Since the dialogue was almost entirely improvised on stage, actors and theatre companies could get away with almost anything.

In the late 19th century scholars began searching for documentary sources on the history of the theatre in Italy.&lt;ref name=testaverde&gt;Anna Maria Testaverde (2007) ''Introduzione a I canovacci della Commedia dell'Arte'' [http://drammaturgia.fupress.net/saggi/saggio.php?id=3422]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over a thousand documents in manuscript or print were discovered that consisted of canovaccia in numerous collections or individually, and usually anonymous.&lt;ref name=testaverde/&gt;

'''''Chronicles of Teddy: Harmony of Exidus''''', known in its original [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] release as '''''Finding Teddy 2''''', is a [[2015 in video gaming|2015]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[platform game]] created by [[France|French]] indie studio LookAtMyGame.

==Plot==

A young girl enters a portal leading from her house into a fantasy world to save her friend and the land from evil. After this set-up, exposition is minimal and the narrative must largely be inferred with environmental clues, as the [[non-player character|NPCs]] speak in musical notes, which can eventually be translated by finding musical runes.

==Gameplay==

''Chronicles of Teddy'' is a [[side-scrolling]] [[action-adventure game]] in which the player controls a girl who is initially equipped with a weak sword. Although she can initially do little but run and jump, she will eventually be able to purchase various equipment and items that will upgrade her abilities. Many of these items can be bought in shops by spending [[marbles]], which are the in-universe [[currency]]. As NPC dialogue is largely indecipherable until later in the game, the player must discover many aspects of the world, including game mechanics, menus, etc., through experimentation.
 
==Reception==

''Chronicles of Teddy'' received positive reviews, currently sitting at 79/100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/chronicles-of-teddy-harmony-of-exidus| title = Chronicles of Teddy: Harmony of Exidus | accessdate = September 26, 2016 | publisher = [[Metacritic]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''PlayStation LifeStyle'' gave the game 8.5/10, calling it a "huge, gorgeous adventure by any reasonable standards, and while retro gamers will probably get a kick out of it more than anyone, it's not content to rest on its laurels and exploit nostalgia." It particularly praised the game's art, writing that, "This is a truly beautiful game, one in which every screen — from the smallest dungeon room to the largest overworld area — has its own identity forged from the intricate details around it." However, it criticized the game's "'learn by playing' approach", which it said "backfire[s] when it comes to some of the game's less-intuitive puzzles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/04/04/chronicles-of-teddy-harmony-of-exidus-review-picturesque-pixels-ps4/ | title = Chronicles of Teddy: Harmony of Exidus Review – Picturesque Pixels (PS4) | first = Jowi | last = Meli | date = April 4, 2016 | accessdate = September 26, 2016 | publisher = PlayStation Lifestyle }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' awarded it 6/10 and concluded it was a "somewhat satisfying puzzle platforming adventure game", praising the "gorgeous retro-inspired pixel art" but denouncing the "combat system that interrupts the flow of gameplay, and lots of backtracking from dungeon to dungeon can make the game feel slow and tedious in spots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu-eshop/chronicles_of_teddy_harmony_of_exidus | title = Review: Chronicles Of Teddy: Harmony Of Exidus (Wii U eShop) | first = Narelle Ho | last = Sang | date = April 19, 2016 | accessdate = September 26, 2016 | publisher = [[Nintendo Life]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' scored it 3/5, saying that a "lack of any direction permeates the title", nevertheless, it added that "the game can still be fun. Just like a good exploratory action/adventure game, the feeling of revisiting old areas with new powers to get at previously unobtainable treasures is exciting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/04/06/review-chronicles-of-teddy-harmony-of-exidus/201002/ | title = Review: Chronicles of Teddy: Harmony of Exidus | first = Jason | last = Bohn | date = April 6, 2016 | accessdate = September 26, 2016 | publisher = [[Hardcore Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of the trick ranges greatly, from some that take a few minutes to accomplish, to much more complex ones that can take months, even years, to master. One of the best-known tricks is the relatively advanced [[coin walk]].

==Coin walk&lt;!--[[Coin walk]] redirects directly here.--&gt;==
The '''coin walk''' is a type of [[coin trick]] in which a [[coin]] is flipped over the fingers to create the illusion of a coin walking across the back of the hand. It is one of the most famous coin manipulation tricks. It is also known as the '''coin roll''', '''knuckle roll''', and the '''steeplechase flourish''', and can also be performed with poker chips, [[Slug (coin)|slugs]], or other similar implements.

The trick is generally performed on the first [[phalanx bone]] of each finger of one hand. After the coin has been flipped over by each phalanx, not including the smallest finger, the thumb brings the coin back under the hand and back to the index finger to repeat the trick as many times as desired.

===In popular culture===
[[Van Heflin]]'s character Sam performs this manipulation throughout the 1946 film ''[[The Strange Love of Martha Ivers]].''
The characters Peter, Walter and Elizabeth Bishop perform this trick in the TV show "[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]."
[[Steve Carell]] and [[Alan Arkin]] also perform the trick in tandem (almost a "dueling knuckle walk") in the movie ''[[The Incredible Burt Wonderstone]]''. In the 2017 [[India]]n [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film ''[[Bairavaa]]'', the protagonist ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]) is shown doing this trick several times throughout the film. Connor, a protagonist in the 2018 game ''[[Detroit: Become Human]]'', is shown doing various coin tricks as the player progresses through the game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1154">'''Ghost-canceling reference''' ('''GCR''') is a special sub-signal on a [[television]] [[television channel|channel]] that receivers can use to attenuate the [[ghosting (television)|ghosting]] effect of a television signal split into [[Multipath propagation|multiple paths]] between transmitter and receiver. 

In the [[United States]], the GCR signal is a [[chirp]] in [[frequency]] of the [[modulating signal]] from 0 Hz to 4.2 MHz, transmitted during the [[vertical blanking interval]] over one video line (line 19 in the U.S.), shifted in phase by 180° once per frame, with this pattern inverted every four lines. Television receivers generate their own local versions of this signal, and use the comparison between the local and remote signals to tune out any ghost images on the screen.

GCR was introduced after its recommendation in 1993 by the Advanced Television Systems Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museum.tv/eotv/advancedtele.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grammy Award for Best Children's Album''' is an honor presented since 2012 at the [[Grammy Award]]s, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.&lt;ref name=Grammy&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honors in various categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position."&lt;ref name=Overview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/ |title=Overview |accessdate=October 10, 2010 |publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027163924/http://www.grammy.com/recording_academy/ |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Best Children's Album award is given to recording artists for works containing quality performances aimed at children. The category takes the place of the previous two categories for recordings for children: [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children | Best Musical Album for Children]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children | Best Spoken Word Album for Children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring|title=Explanation For Category Restructuring|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This merger meant essentially returning to the categorization set-up prior to 1994 (although with a small name change), when there was a single [[Grammy Award for Best Album for Children | Best Album for Children]] category.

The restructuring of these and other categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards. According to the Academy, "[it] passed the proposal that a return to one category for all types of recordings for children, as it was from 1958-1993, would be most appropriate in this new context." &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/explanation-for-category-restructuring Grammy Awards Restructuring i am the best person in the world

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6364">'''Grotesque dance''' ([[French language|French]]: '''''danse grotesque'''''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: '''''ballo grottesco'''''  Italian: danza grottesca) is a category of theatrical [[dance]] that became more clearly differentiated in the 18th century and was incorporated into [[ballet]], although it had its roots in earlier centuries. As opposed to the ''danse noble'' or "noble dance" performed in royal courts which emphasized beauty of movement and noble themes, grotesque dances were comic or lighthearted and created for [[buffoon]]s and ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' characters to amuse and entertain spectators or patrons. In 16th and 17th centuries grotesque dances were often presented as an [[anti-masque]], performed between the acts of more serious courtly entertainments. Likewise, the 17th century ''ballet a entrées'' (a series of loosely connected tableaux rather than a continuous dramatic narrative) sometimes contained grotesque sequences, most notably those devised by the [[Henri I, Duke of Nemours|Duke of Nemours]] for the court of [[Louis XIII]]. 

Some of the grotesque performers were physically deformed, but the Italian tradition of ''ballo grottesco'', typified by the dancer and choreographer, [[Gennaro Magri]] whose career was at its apex in the 1760s, involved a high degree of virtuosity and athleticism. Ballets which contain grotesque dances or consist solely of grotesque dance include [[André Campra|Campra]]'s ''Le jaloux trompé'' and [[Ravel]]'s ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' (Dorcon's dance in Part 1). Dancers who excelled in the grotesque genre besides Magri included [[Margrethe Schall]] and [[John D'Auban]].

== Magri's ''Grotteschi'' ==
[[File:Grotesque Dancers.png|thumb|Grotesque Dancers - Plate from Gregorio Lambranzi's ''New and Curious School of Theatrical Dancing'' (Nuremberg, 1716)|325x325px]]Gennaro Magri's 1779 treatise, ''Trattato teorico-prattico di ballo'', one of the leading publications about dance technique from the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=International Encyclopedia of Dance - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195173697.001.0001/acref-9780195173697|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195173697.001.0001/acref-9780195173697}}&lt;/ref&gt;, offers a rare view of the grotesque style of theatrical dance. One of the achievements of Magri's treatise is that is makes the argument for placing the ''ballerini grotteschi'' on the same level of appreciation as ''ballerini seri''. According to Magri, false positions (inwardly turned) or Spanish positions (neutral in turnout) were more often used by ''ballerini grotteschi,'' as opposed to the normative French [[Turnout (ballet)|turned out]] positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56876054|title=The grotesque dancer on the eighteenth-century stage : Gennaro Magri and his world|date=2005|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|others=Harris-Warrick, Rebecca., Brown, Bruce Alan.|isbn=9780299203542|location=Madison|oclc=56876054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magri asserts pirouettes on one foot, revolving for as many turns as possible, as part of the repertory of the ''grotteschi,'' whereas pirouettes on two feet were for amateurs. He also links the ''grotteschi''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s dance vocabulary with the cabrioles. One interesting such airborne step, ''salto dell'impiccato'' (translated as: hangman's jump) requires great elevation in order to create contrast between the trunk and the falling arms, and then a one-foot landing with the second leg detached into the air as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56876054|title=The grotesque dancer on the eighteenth-century stage : Gennaro Magri and his world|date=2005|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|others=Harris-Warrick, Rebecca., Brown, Bruce Alan.|isbn=9780299203542|location=Madison|oclc=56876054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magri assigns wrapping steps, sprung steps, steps of multiple turns, and airborne steps interweaving and beating the legs into the ''grotteschi''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s repertory of movements. However, he makes the distinction that it is not these steps that make the ''ballerini grotteschi'', but rather the body as a "vortex of force"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56876054|title=The grotesque dancer on the eighteenth-century stage : Gennaro Magri and his world|date=2005|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|others=Harris-Warrick, Rebecca., Brown, Bruce Alan.|isbn=9780299203542|location=Madison|oclc=56876054}}&lt;/ref&gt; that articulates kinetic principles to get energy out into physical movement in a controlled and concentrated manner. The grotesque bodies are bodies that constantly concentrate and release energy as a characteristic part of their activity.

A '''guitarist''' (or a '''guitar player''') is a person who plays the [[guitar]]. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family [[musical instrument|instruments]] such as [[classical guitar]]s, [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[electric guitar]]s, and [[bass guitar]]s. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by [[singing]] or playing the harmonica.

==Techniques==
The guitarist may employ any of several methods for sounding the guitar, including finger picking, depending on the type of strings used (either [[Classical guitar strings|nylon]] or [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|steel]]), and including [[strumming]] with the fingers, or a [[guitar pick]] made of bone, horn, plastic, metal, felt, leather, or paper, and melodic [[flatpicking]] and [[fingerstyle guitar|finger-picking]]. 

The guitarist may also employ various methods for selecting notes and chords, including fingering, thumbing, the barre (a finger lying across many or all strings at a particular fret), and 'bottleneck' or steel-guitar slides, usually made of glass or metal. These left- and right-hand techniques may be intermixed in performance.

==Notable guitarists==
[[File:Great guitarist montage.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Montage of guitarists. The guitarists pictured are named on the image page.]]

===Rock, heavy metal, and jazz===
Several [[magazine]]s and [[website]]s have compiled what they intend as lists of the greatest guitarists—for example ''The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time'' by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, or ''100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time'' by ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine.

;{{anchor|Rolling Stone}}''Rolling Stone'': In 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine published a list called ''The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time''. This list included 100 guitarists whom the magazine editor [[David Fricke]] considered the best, with a brief introduction for each of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231|title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|date=2003-09-18|accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first in this list is the American guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] introduced by [[Pete Townshend]], guitarist for [[The Who]], who was, in his turn, ranked at #50 in the list.

:In describing the list to readers, Paul MacInnes from British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "Surprisingly enough for an American magazine, the top 10 is fair jam-packed with Yanks," though he also noted three exceptions in the top 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/feb/13/whoarethe100greatestguita|title=Who are the 100 greatest guitarists of all time?|first=Paul|last=MacInnes|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2007-02-13|accessdate=2009-11-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online magazine ''[[Blogcritics]]'' criticized the list for introducing some {{which|date=May 2010}} allegedly undeserving guitarists while forgetting some artists the writer considered perhaps more worthy, such as [[Johnny Marr]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Phil Keaggy]] or [[John Petrucci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/the-top-100-guitarists-according-to/ |publisher=''[[Blogcritics]]'' |title=The Top 100 Guitarists According to Rolling Stone |author=The Theory |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2009-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605091245/http://blogcritics.org/the-top-100-guitarists-according-to/ |archivedate=5 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:In 2011, ''Rolling Stone'' updated the list, which this time was chosen by a panel of guitarists and other experts with the top 5 consisting of [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Keith Richards]] and [[Jeff Beck]]. Artists who had not been included in the previous list were added. [[Rory Gallagher]], for example, was ranked in 57th place.&lt;ref name="Greatest guitarist Rory Gallagher"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/rory-gallagher-19691231|title=100 Greatest Guitarists: Rory Gallagher|publisher=Rolling Stone magazine|accessdate=31 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712063544/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/rory-gallagher-19691231|archive-date=23 November 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time'' is mentioned in many biographies about artists who appear in the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Succeed As a Female Guitarist: The Essential Guide for Working in a Male-dominated Industry|first=Vivian|last= Clement|page=1|publisher=Alfred Publishing|year=2007|isbn=0-7390-4304-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Guitar World'': ''[[Guitar World]]'', a monthly music magazine devoted to the guitar, also published their list of 100 greatest guitarists in the book ''Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time from the Pages of Guitar World Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time from the Pages of Guitar World Magazine|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|author=Jeff Kitts, Brad Tolinski|year=2002|isbn=0-634-04619-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different from the ''Rolling Stone'' list, which listed guitarists in descending order, ''Guitar World'' divided guitarists by [[music genre]]—such as "Lords of Hard Rock" for [[hard rock]] artists or "Jazzmen" for [[jazz]] players. Despite the appearance in other magazines like ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'', vol. 117, n° 49, pp. 67&lt;/ref&gt; this publication by ''Guitar World'' was criticized for including no female musicians within its selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender in the music industry: Rock, discourse and girl power|page=38|first=Marion|last= Leonard|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2007|isbn=0-7546-3862-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Guitar World'' recently published a list of "Eight Amazing Female Acoustic Players," including [[Kaki King]], [[Muriel Anderson]] and [[Sharon Isbin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Eight Amazing Female Acoustic Guitar Players|url = http://www.guitarworld.com/acoustic-nation-eight-amazing-female-acoustic-players|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''TIME'' and others: Following the death of [[Les Paul]], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' website presented their list of 10 greatest artists in [[electric guitar]]. As in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list, Jimi Hendrix was chosen as the greatest guitarist followed by [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] from [[Guns N'Roses|Guns 'N' Roses]], [[B.B. King]], [[Keith Richards]],  [[Jimmy Page]], and [[Eric Clapton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1916544_1921910,00.html|title=The 10 Greatest Electric-Guitar Players|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''|accessdate=2009-11-18 | date=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gigwise.com]]'', an online music magazine, also ranks Jimi Hendrix as the greatest guitarist ever, followed by Jimmy Page, B.B. King, Keith Richards and [[Kirk Hammett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/40852/The-50-Greatest-Guitarists-Ever|title=The 50 Greatest Guitarists...

===Other genres===
There are many [[List of classical guitarists|classical guitarists]] listed as ''notable'' in their respective epochs.

In recent decades, the most "notable classical and cross genre" guitarist was [[Paco de Lucía]], one of the first [[flamenco guitarists]] to have successfully crossed over into other genres of music such as classical and jazz. [[Richard Chapman (musician)|Richard Chapman]] and [[Eric Clapton]], authors of ''Guitar: Music, History, Players'', describe de Lucía as a "titanic figure in the world of [[flamenco guitar]]",&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last1=Chapman|first1=Richard|last2=Clapton|first2=Eric|title=Guitar: music, history, players|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLUXAQAAIAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Pub.|isbn=978-0-7894-5963-3|page=40|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dennis Koster, author of ''Guitar Atlas, Flamenco'', has referred to de Lucía as "one of history's greatest guitarists.".&lt;ref name="Koster2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koster|first=Dennis|title=Guitar Atlas, Flamenco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l8SMixi1mbQC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|isbn=978-0-7390-2478-2|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/arts/music/paco-de-lucia-flamenco-guitarist-dies-at-66.html?_r=0|title=Paco de Lucía, Master Flamenco Guitarist, Dies at 66|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1572">'''Hanne Tott''' or Tod, also called Price and Kuhn (14 February 1771 - August 15,1826), was a Danish [[circus]] artist and circus manager. She and her family played an important part in the history of the circus in [[Scandinavia]]. She should not be confused with her sister-in-law [[Rosalia Price]], also called Madame Price.

She was born to Stephen and Hanne Todd and married in 1791 to the British circus manager [[James Price (1761-1805)]]. She and her spouse toured Scandinavia, [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] with their circus. In 1793-94, they performed at [[Stenborg Theatre]] in [[Stockholm]]. From 1795, they regularly performed in [[Copenhagen]] during the summer and toured Denmark and Norway during the winter. They were permitted to found a permanent stage in Copenhagen in 1801. She became manager after the death of her spouse in 1805. In 1810, she married [[Frantz Joseph Kuhn]] (1783-1832), with whom she shared her position as manager.

'''Ines Torelli''' (née '''Ines Stierli''', born 14 June 1931) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] comedian, radio personality, and stage, voice and film actress starring usually in Swiss German language cinema and television and stage productions.

== Early life and education ==
Born and raised in [[St. Gallen]], [[Canton of St. Gallen]] in Switzerland to Walter Stierli,&lt;ref name="hds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D9568.php|title=Torelli, Ines|publisher=HDS|author=Hansruedi Lerch|language=German|date=2011-07-27|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ines Torelli worked as a domestic helper in 1948/50, the so-called ''Welschlandjahr'' which at that time usually teenage women absolved in western Switzerland (''Welschland'') to improve the knowledge of the French language. As an autodidact Torelli got a first chance in the "Cabaret Rüeblisaft" those member she became between 1954 and 1956. Subsequently, she was engaged by the [[Cabaret Federal]] in Zürich, followed by various tours along with [[Schaggi Streuli]], among others in "Sie und de Chef".&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-inestorelli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Ines_Torelli|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|title=Ines Torelli|author=Thomas Hostettler|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Theater am Hechtplatz]] Torelli embodied the title roles in various musicals,&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-hechtplatz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Theater_am_Hechtplatz,_Z%C3%BCrich_ZH|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|title=Theater am Hechtplatz, Zürich ZH|author=Tanja Stenzl|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; so in 1965 in "Bibi Balù", in 1967 in "Golden Girl", in 1968 "Pfui Martina" and in 1972 in "Viva Banana". In 1968 she starred alongside [[Ruedi Walter]] and [[Margrit Rainer]] as ''Olly Moreen'' in ''[[Die kleine Niederdorf-Oper]]'' at the Corso Theater in Zürich.&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-ruediwalter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Ruedi_Walter|title=Ruedi Walter|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|author=|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-margritrainer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Margrti_Rainer|title=Margrit Rainer|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|author=|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-08-22}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-inestorelli"/&gt;

== Theater, cabaret, voice acting, television and film ==
Ines Torelli played in various farces at [[Bernhard Theater Zürich]],&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-bernhard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Bernhard-Theater,_Z%C3%BCrich_ZH|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|title=Bernhard-Theater, Zürich ZH|author=|language=German|date=2013-11-22|accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as partner of [[Jörg Schneider]] and [[Paul Bühlmann]],&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-jörgschneider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Schneider|title=Jörg Schneider|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|author=|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-bühlmann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tls.theaterwissenschaft.ch/wiki/Paul_Bühlmann|publisher=theaterwissenschaft.ch|title=Paul Bühlmann|author=|language=German|date=2013-12-05|accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; so among other things in 1968 in "Mademoiselle Pepsi", "Der keusche Lebemann" in 1972, in 1974 in "Die Schwindelfiliale" and in 1976 in "Der fidele Casimir". Unsatisfied by these roles, in 1977 she starred, with artistic but not a commercial success, in the solo program "Torelli total". Nevertheless, she continued to play in comedies like "Potz Millione", with Rainer and Walter and directed by [[Inigo Gallo]],&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-jörgschneider"/&gt; on [[Bernhard-Theater]] in 1979/80 that also became a big tour success, and in 1982 in Yves Jamiaque's "Acapulco, Madame" in the dialect version of Schneider and directed by Gallo at the [[Theater am Hechtplatz]].&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-inestorelli"/&gt;

Torelli had also great success and was very popular as a chanson singer, so with "De Gigi vo Arosa" and as ''Iduna'' in Burkhard's "Der schwarze Hecht" at the ''Corso Theater'' in 1981. From 1986 to 1994 she was the head of the [[Zürcher Märchenbühne]], and besides of her own dialect version of ''Räuber Hotzenplotz'' and [[Jörg Schneider]]'s 1994 fairytale edition of "Das brave kleine Schneiderlein", Torelli staged among others again with Schneider in numerous musicals with children.&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-inestorelli"/&gt;

She also became popular by numerous radio appearances and roles in Swiss and German films, among them in ''Oberstadtgass'' in 1956 and in one episode of ''[[Fascht e Familie]]''. Beside the stage and television and film, again with Jörg Schneider and Paul Bühlmann, Ines Torelli became also very popular in the German speaking area by fairytale-radio plays records.&lt;ref name="srf-archivperlen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/unterhaltung/people/schweiz/vip-archiv/archiv-perlen-die-schoensten-joerg-schneider-momente|title=Archiv-Perlen: Die schönsten Jörg-Schneider-Momente|publisher=[[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen]] SRF|author=Karl Baldinger|language=German|date=2015-08-22|accessdate=2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zol-20150822"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zol.ch/bezirk-hinwil/wetzikon/joerg-schneider-ist-tot/story/13778801|title=Jörg Schneider ist tot|publisher=[[Zürcher Oberländer]]|author=|language=German|date=2015-08-22|accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 she emigrated with her husband to Canada to reside on the [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]] peninsula on the east coast of Canada. In 1996 they acquired an empty factory and rebuilt it into the ''Starlight Theatre'' to house up to 500 spectator seats. End of 1998 the financially unsuccessful private theater had to close.&lt;ref name="theaterlexikon-inestorelli"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Ines Torelli is citizen of the [[Municipalities of the canton of Zürich|municipality]] of [[Wettswil am Albis]] in the [[Canton of Zürich]] and of [[Aristau]] in the [[Canton of Aargau]]. In 1991 she married Edi Baur, a Swiss theatre director and actor,&lt;ref name="hds"/&gt; who died on 14 October 2009.&lt;ref name="inestorelli-rosebay"/&gt; Although she is living in Canada since 1996, the friendship with [[Jörg Schneider]] survided.&lt;ref name="srf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/unterhaltung/people/schweiz/ueberraschungsanruf-ines-torelli-ruehrt-joerg-schneider-zu-traenen|title=Überraschungsanruf: Ines Torelli rührt Jörg Schneider zu Tränen |publisher=srf.ch|author=|language=German|date=2015-01-18|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6353">'''Java Pacific Film''' (alternatively, '''Java Pasific Film''') was a short-lived film production company that helped make significant contributions to [[Indonesian cinema]] in the 1930s.

==Background==
During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the [[Dutch East Indies]] had been directed by [[The Teng Chun]], based on [[Chinese mythology]] or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=380–381}} This situation was created by the [[Great Depression]], which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low [[profit margin]] for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed [[Hollywood]] productions.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=145}}

==History==
Java Pacific Film was founded in 1934 in [[Bandoeng]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmuseum.nl/bedrijf/java-pacific-film|title=Java Pacific Film bij Film in Nederland|publisher=[[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]]|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what was then the [[Dutch East Indies]], by Dutch-Indonesian journalist [[Albert Balink]] working with the [[Wong brothers]]. Balink, who intended to target high-class audiences, had found financial support for the new company, took control, while the Wongs brought a studio and film equipment to the endeavour. The studio, an old [[tapioca flour]] factory, featured simple film editing equipment, several buildings to serve as living quarters for the employees, and a veranda surrounded by trees used for editing.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=156}} The smokestack had the company's initials, JPF, in large letters.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=156}} Their first production was a documentary about [[Mount Merapi]], entitled ''De Merapi Dreight'' (''Mount Merapi Looms''), in 1934.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=165}}

Dutch filmmaker [[Mannus Franken]] was brought to the country in 1934 to help make the movie ''[[Pareh]]'' between 1934 and 1936.&lt;ref name="HjortMacKenzie2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Martin|editor=Hjort Mette|others=Scott MacKenzie|title=Cinema and Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9_JeRIL-UcC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=23 July 2012|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415208635|pages=162–76|chapter=Indonesia: The Movie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franken had previously had success with documentary filmmaking in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=159}} The production cost 75,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]], with its star [[Rd. Mochtar]] receiving 250 gulden monthly.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=162}} A commercial flop which bankrupted the producers and company,{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=161–62}} ''Pareh'' is credited with shifting the focus of Indonesian cinema from Chinese productions and subject matter to a more local industry. The film is also praised for its cinematic quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=8MpnoVvnB5cC |title=Cinema: A Visual Anthropology |isbn=978-1-84520-793-9 |last1=Gray |first1=Gordon |date=2010 |publisher=Berg |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pareh, een rijstlied van Java |url=http://www.filmmuseum.nl/en/film/pareh-een-rijstlied-van-java?quicktabs_2=2 |work=filmmuseum.nl |publisher=[[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] |location=Amsterdam |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69MxyYcIp?url=http://www.filmmuseum.nl/en/film/pareh-een-rijstlied-van-java?quicktabs_2=2 |archivedate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Bachelour's of History Thesis |chapter=Sekilas Perkembangan Perfilman di Indonesia |trans-chapter=An Overview of the Development of Film in Indonesia |language=Indonesian |title=Kebijakan Pemerintahan Orde Baru Terhadap Perfilman Indonesia Tahun 1966–1980 |trans-title=New Order Policy Towards Indonesian Films (1966–1980) |last=Prayogo |first=Wisnu Agung |year=2009 |publisher=University of Indonesia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successor==
Balink collected funds from numerous sponsors and established the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate ({{lang|nl|Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat}}, or ANIF) in late 1936.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=165–166}} This government-owned&lt;ref name="SenHill2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sen|first1=Krishna|last2=Hill|first2=David T.|title=Media, Culture and Politics in Indonesia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMhWm38KQcsC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=2006|publisher=Equinox |isbn=9789793780429|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; company involved all major figures from JPF.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=167–168}} Working mostly on [[newsreel]]s and documentaries,{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=165–166}} in 1937 it produced the commercial success ''[[Terang Boelan]]''.&lt;ref name="Slobin2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slobin|first=Mark|title=Global Soundtracks: Worlds of Film Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQw5Ci7sbasC&amp;pg=PA217|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=2008|publisher=Wesleyan UP|isbn=9780819568823|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 it released Franken's documentary ''[[Tanah Sabrang]]'' and in 1940 closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/web/encyclopedia/detail/793/Algemeen-Nederlandsch-Indisch-Filmsyndicaat-ANIF |title=Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat (ANIF) |language=Indonesian |work=Jakarta City Government |publisher=Jakarta City Government |archivedate=25 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69POqEHa0?url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/web/encyclopedia/detail/793/Algemeen-Nederlandsch-Indisch-Filmsyndicaat-ANIF |accessdate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joggy Bear''' is a children's character created by Simon Gould, who tours with fitness guru [[Lizzie Webb]].  Joggy appeared in his own television series for [[Channel 4]] in the 1980s and 1990s, in which Webb also starred in. The character teaches children about exercise and keeping fit. 

Lizzie Webb, often known as "Mad Lizzie", presented exercise routines on the show. She created many workouts, such as "Shake-out with Lizzie and Joggy", which she and Joggy would create in every show to try to keep children active and Joogy fit. Joggy bear was number 2 in the video charts in the early 1990s. There were many videos made in the 1990s and two DVDs in 2005. Lizzie Webb and Joggy Bear now tour schools and venues around the UK.

"Joggy Bear" was played by the young actress Sophie Barnard, who famously has also been "Pudsey Bear" on [[BBC]]'s UK charity show [[Children in Need]]. Sophie Barnard also played a role in the [[BAFTA]] Award winning children's television program [[Teletubbies]], in which she has been acting as character Laa-Laa. Sophie got the role as Joggy Bear after auditioning for the role and being selected as the most qualified of the six applicants. Controversy broke out around Sophie's appointment to the role after it was rumoured that she entered into a relationship with Joggy Bear Producer Simon Gould. 

Although the TV show ended in the early 1990s, Joggy has since continued, mainly off screen.  Lizzie now tours with Joggy across the UK in 'Jiggy's Keep Fit Club'.

The Grand Duchy of [[Luxembourg]] has submitted films for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] since 1997. The Foreign Language Film award is handed out annually by the [[United States]] [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to a [[feature length|feature-length]] motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-[[English language|English]] dialogue.&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule Thirteen: Special Rules for the Foreign Language Film Award |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822101822/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018}}, fifteen Luxembourgian films have been submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but none have yet been nominated for an Academy Award.

==Submissions==
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via [[secret ballot]] to determine the five nominees for the award.&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt; Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Luxembourg for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.

Because of Luxembourg's small size, many of the submitted films were co-productions with neighboring countries. [[AMPAS]] disqualified ''Your Name is Justine'' in 2006, arguing that Luxembourg did not have sufficient artistic control over the muilti-national film, which was directed by a Poland-based Venezuelan director, set in Germany and Poland, funded primarily by Luxembourg, and shot mostly in Polish and English. The film was originally considered to represent Poland, but it did not make Poland's four-film shortlist &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120720075610/http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,55670,3642251.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was subsequently selected to represent Luxembourg.

Luxembourg's first submission, ''Elles'' also straddled the nationality guidelines. Directed by a Portuguese and set in [[Lisbon]], the film was primarily in French, and featured a diverse lead cast from France, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the US, but not Luxembourg. ''Dead Man's Hand'' was a minority Luxembourg production, which actually represented [[Cinema of Belgium|Belgium]] at several film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfs.org.sg/event.php?id=79|title=Singapore Film Society|website=Singapore Film Society|accessdate=6 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113084348/http://sfs.org.sg/event.php?id=79|archive-date=13 January 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other films were directed by native-born Luxembourgian directors.

Of Luxembourg's nine accepted submissions, two were light comedies (1998 and 2002), two were contemporary dramas (1997 and 2003) one was an animated film (2005), one was a thriller (2008,) one was a crime drama (2013,) and two were period dramas set in the 1940s (2009) and 1960s (2007).

'''Luna Park''' was a popular amusement park near [[Hamburg, Germany]] that was opened to the public in 1913, closed from 1914 to 1917 (due to [[World War I]]), and then reopened from 1917 to 1923. The only remaining reminders of the former "funland" are a children's playground and roads named "Lunapark" serving the former park site.

[[File:Omnibot 2000-P3170191-gradient.jpg|thumb|The Omnibot 2000]]

The '''Omnibot''' (オムニボット) is a toy [[robot]] originally manufactured by [[Tomy]] in the mid-1980s. The name then came to apply to the successful line of robots manufactured by the company. The initial Omnibot was announced with expectations of restoring popular interest in robots, at a time when it was becoming obvious that robots with advanced [[AI]] such as [[R2-D2]] were still a long way away. A more advanced version of the Omnibot was called the Omnibot 2000 and did not have a plastic bubble over its head. With the success of the Omnibots, the Omnibot range quickly expanded. After the [[North American video game crash of 1983]] and its debilitating effect on the entire nascent [[home electronics]] industry, the Omnibot faded away but it was revived in the early 2000s. The latest version of the Omnibot is the i-SOBOT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 1985|title=Tomy's Omnibot|journal=Adweek: MAC/Western advertising news|volume=35|issue=1-32|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Omnibot 2000-P3170194.jpg|thumb|upright|The cassette tape player of an Omnibot 2000]]
Both the Omnibot and the more advanced Omnibot 2000 had a [[cassette tape]] player built into the chest area of the robot, which slid out like a drawer to reveal the cassette and could record and play back sequences of commands, as well as regular audio recordings.  The built in digital clock with timers and alarms allowed the playback of movement recordings at specified times, such as moving into the bedroom in the morning.  Both robots were able to broadcast speech from the remote control handset through a speaker on the robot, and both were shipped with a cardboard "home" base which was suggested to be taped to the floor and used as a reference point for programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1986|title=Omnibot Grows Up|journal=Popular Science|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Omnibot 2000-P3170193.jpg|thumb|Detail of the claw system]]
Both Omnibot and the Omnibot 2000 could carry light objects.  The Omnibot carried a specially made tray which slotted into its claws, and the Omnibot 2000 had a tray which slotted into its motorised "accessory panel", allowing the tray to revolve cups and glasses into the reach of the arm.

The Omnibot 2000 was 25&amp;nbsp;inches tall, powered by a 6-volt [[lead–acid battery]] and two [[AA batteries]]. Its right arm was controllable. The user could control its shoulder, elbow, wrist and fingers, the left arm being a poseable "dummy".

Unfortunately, losing the remote control unit for an Omnibot meant that the robot was virtually useless outside of the clock and cassette deck based functions.

Two lesser known robots in the Omnibot range were the Omnibot OOM and the Omniwagon.  The Omnibot OOM was shaped like a standard Omnibot except with the addition of a spherical head, its remote controller including a basic form of [[Speech recognition|voice-control]].  The Omniwagon was merely a remote controlled drive unit and wheels from an omnibot with a flat surface on top to carry objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1985|title=Omnibot|journal=Robotics Age|volume=7|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Robots==

===Omnibot OOM / Hearoid===
The Omnibot OOM (later released in North America as the "Hearoid") was closely based on the standard Omnibot. Changes included a more anthropomorphic head design, remotely controlled light-up eyes that acted rather like headlights, and a more sophisticated remote controller that included primitive voice control.

===Robie Sr.===
Radio Shack retailed a version of the Omnibot named the Robie Sr.. Made by Tomy in Japan, these were essentially a standard Omnibot, but with the dome-shaped head replaced by the more anthropomorphic head of the Omnibot OOM / Hearoid, and the sound is different compared to the original Omnibot.

===Omnibot Jr. "Charmmy"/Robie Jr.===
The Omnibot Jr., also known as the "Charmmy", was a 10.5&amp;nbsp;inches tall remote controlled robot with an attachable tray, featuring styling reminiscent of the original Omnibot.  Simultaneously released by Radio Shack as the Robie Jr., Omnibot Jr. included a microphone on either side of the robot's head that allowed it to hear an ultrasonic sound emitted by the remote controller. The dual microphones allowed Charmmy to determine the rough direction of the controller, and navigate to its location - sometimes even around corners. The Omnibot Jr. was also equipped with a bump sensor that allowed it to navigate around objects, and this sensor was also used along with sensors in the arms to trigger several recorded announcements should the robot bump into an object or an item be placed on the tray.

===Verbot/KI*KU*ZO===
The classic Omnibot had a cheaper, smaller cousin known as the Verbot, known in its native Japan as the KI*KU*ZO. At nine inches tall, the Verbot was the mid-sized option compared to the smaller Dingbot and the larger Omnibot. It was somewhat similar to the Omnibot in appearance but was much more limited in features. The Verbot also came with a wireless remote control that could operate the robot through voice commands. Up to eight commands could be programmed. The Verbot could move forward and backward, left and right, on command. The Verbot was also able to pick up small objects, a feature many toy robots of the era lacked. The robot expressed some personality by blinking and smiling. Disadvantages common to the Verbot were that it was quite noisy, reprogramming was necessary every time the robot was powered up again, and as with all of the Omnibot series its white plastic body would turn yellow if left in the sun. The Verbot was actually quite complex, utilizing a single motor for all its movements and an intricate set of gears for picking up objects. Programming Verbot was accomplished by pushing one of the buttons on its front panel and holding it down while the corresponding action was spoken into the remote control's microphone and then releasing the button. As with most Omnibots, losing the remote meant the robot could not be used to full capacity, but some hobbyists have modified cheap 1980s [[walkie-talkie]]s for inputting voice commands.

==Omnibots today==
[[File:I-SOBOT-Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|upright|Japanese i-SOBOT, November 2007 model.]]
In recent times, many hobbyists have turned to hacking, tweaking and improving their Omnibots. Commonly added features are IR Sensors, video cameras, speech recognition chips, stronger motors, microcontrollers, sonars and other advanced enhancements that would not have been possible in the 80s.

In the early 2000s, a gutted Omnibot was used as part of a contestant on the [[United States|US]] television show [[Battlebots]]. The robot, named [[Dr. Inferno Jr.]] (an updated version of another combat robot that used a gutted Omnibot) won several awards in the competition's "Lightweight Division". The Omnibot on top of the drivetrain had no dome on top, and its arms were replaced with twin saws.

===i-SOBOT===
In 2006, shortly after the merger of Tomy and Takara, the company first unveiled a prototype for a new Omnibot, initially called "Omnibot 2007: i-SOBOT" but which has since been officially named, "Omnibot 17μ: i-SOBOT." ("μ" is the Greek letter "mu" symbolizing micron, referring to the specs of the servo motors) in Japan and simply "i-SOBOT" in the U.S. market.  i-SOBOT was scheduled to go on sale in Japan in October 2007 (Japanese language with blue and white color), but an English language, black and grey version went on sale first in the U.S., in September, 2007.  Reportedly, a European version will go on the market in 2008.

i-SOBOT, which has been certified by Guinness World Records as "the world's smallest humanoid robot in production" is equipped with 17 proprietary servo-motors and can be controlled by an IR remote controller and also via voice commands.  It is capable of speaking hundreds of words and phrases and has nearly 200 pre-programmed actions, plus allows additional programming by the user via the remote control.

The film is directed by Kim Druzhinin and Andrey Shalopa, produced by Panfilov's Twenty Eight and [[Gaijin Entertainment]]. Initially the film used crowdfunding, later it has been financially supported by Russian and [[Kazakhstan]] governments and Gaijin Entertainment game development company. The premiere took place in [[Volokolamsk]] in 16 November 2016 and in Russia in 24 November 2016.&lt;ref name=prem0&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gazeta.ru/culture/2016/11/16/a_10338035.shtml|title=28 самураев|website=Gazeta.ru|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot was written by Andrey Shalopa in 2009, and the production team took their [[Trailer (promotion)|teaser trailer]] of the film to Boomstarter [[crowdfunding]] platform, seeking co-financiers. "It will be a film about Soviet heroes. We will describe the battle near Dubosekovo, which went down in history as the deed of Panfilov's 28 men". The crowdfunding campaign was successful, and the film raised 3 million rubles out of planned 300 thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boomstarter.ru/projects/36881/28_panfilovtsev|title=28 панфиловцев - Boomstarter|date=2 December 2016|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=6 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202210826/https://boomstarter.ru/projects/36881/28_panfilovtsev|archivedate=2 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the premiere the film raised 34,746 million rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://28panfilovcev.com/payments.php|title=28 панфиловцев|date=2 December 2016|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=6 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202210525/http://28panfilovcev.com/payments.php|archivedate=2 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
USSR, late November 1941. Based on the account by reporter Vasiliy Koroteev that appeared in the [[Red Army]]'s newspaper, ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]'', shortly after the [[Battle of Moscow]], this is the story of [[Panfilov's Twenty-Eight Guardsmen|Panifilov's Twenty-Eight]], a group of twenty-eight soldiers of the Red Army's [[316th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|316th Rifle Division]], under the command of General Ivan Panfilov, that stopped the advance on Moscow of a column of fifty-four German tanks of the 11th Panzer Division for several days. Though armed only with standard issue [[Mosin-Nagant]] infantry rifles and DP and PM-M1910 machine guns, all useless against tanks, and with wholly inadequate [[RPG-40]] [[anti-tank grenade]]s and [[PTRD-41]] anti-tank rifles, they fight tirelessly and defiantly, with uncommon bravery and unwavering dedication, to protect Moscow and their Motherland.

==Cast==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}

Due to the peculiarities of the crowd-budgeting budget, the casting took a long time. The first confirmed actor was Yakov Kucherevskiy, who played Sergeant Dobrobabin - he agreed to withdraw two years before filming. The most recent confirmed Aleksey Morozov for the role of political instructor Klochkov - one day before the start of the shooting period. Panfilov's division was formed in the [[Kazakh SSR]], the company included many Kazakhs, so many actors of Oriental appearance were required in the crowd - Shalope's team turned to the national diasporas of Moscow, [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Ivanovo]]. In general, the team consisted of 360 participants, and in total the project involved up to 700 people.

==Filming ==
[[File:28 Panfilovcev.jpg|thumb|220px|Actors and members of the crew of the film, in November 2013]]
In the process of filming, the picture operators used the following documents: storyboard, director's script, operator's table and tank battle scheme. The battle scheme contained the exact location of the tanks and the camera at different times, and the operator's table described what technique to use in what scenes. Such careful preparation allowed the team to work in winter conditions and with a short daylight.

The directors wanted to use a minimum of 3D animation and take as many effects as possible on the camera. The first experiments they conducted, moving primitive toy tanks the size of a matchbox on the sheets with the help of ropes. These experiments have shown that using reduced models of tanks will create the right level of realism.

As a contractor for the creation of special effects, Scandinava studio, previously specializing in commercials and having no experience with large films, was chosen. Specialists from Scandinava performed experiments on high-speed shooting and interested Druzhinin and Shalopu with his clip "Oil", in which a column of combustible liquid was rotating and ignited without the use of 3D animation. To work on the film, the studio expanded the staff from six to 28 people.

[[File:Tanks 28 panfilov's men pavilion.jpg|thumb|220px|Pavilion "Lenfilm"]]
[[File:Green tanks 28 panfilovs men 12x8.jpg|thumb|220px|Full-scale shooting models 1: 1]]

To create personnel with tanks, studio specialists used the old technology of combined shooting-special effect. On the field, full-size wooden models of tanks, covered with green cloth, were used in the field, which the workers moved around the field on a sleigh. Then the surveyors made measurements of the landscape, and Scandinava recreated the battlefield at a scale of 1:16 in the studio and photographed all the scenes with detailed models of tanks, reduced by 16 times. To create a winter atmosphere in the film (snow, blizzard, the sky changing in the film's drama), the consequences of the attacks (smoke, ash), and to amplify gun shots and some explosions, Scandinava decided not to use the traditional approach using CGI ([[Computer-generated imagery]], The letters "computer-generated images"), instead taking real natural effects on the camera. Shooting on the nature, tanks and natural effects were collected by layers on the computer in one single image.

This approach required a certain technique of filming. In order to move the toy tank were like moving the present, it was necessary to shoot it four times faster, and then slow down the received frames. The camera, accordingly, had to be moved four times faster than on the field, which can not be done with hands. Therefore, in the pavilion shootings for camera control, the operators used the robotic arm KUKA Agilus, provided and programmed with the help of specialists from the Research [[Russian State Scientific Center for Robotics and Technical Cybernetics|Research Institute of Robotics]]. For close-up shots, a full-size mock-up of the PzKpfw IV tank was built, the cabin of which was recreated on Lenfilm as a separate capsule on the springs, which made it possible to achieve realistic pitching during shooting. Currently, the layout is kept in the Museum of the Karelian isthmus in the Vyborg.

The whole film was shot on the camera Arri Alexa (English) Russian, except for tanks, where because of the size required the apparatus of the company Red. Optometry used a spherical lens Illumina of the St. Petersburg plant "LOMO" - according to the operator, this solution allowed to smooth out the effect of the "excessively high-quality" image, which is inherent in all modern cameras.

===Music===
[[File:Creation of music in Panvilovs 28 men.ogg|thumb|Description of the process of writing the music for the film.]]
Sound for the film was recorded and reduced to the technical base of the studio "[[Nevafilm]]". Mikhail Kostylev, famous for his soundtracks for computer games, took up writing music for the film. According to the composer, he sought to convey a sense of pride in the Victory and the feat, creating an epic musical background in which the drama would remain. The leitmotif of most compositions is the theme "Eternal Flame", which Kostylev wrote at an early stage of the production of the film. The soundtrack was recorded after the presentation of the video, with the first score for all instruments was recorded using a [[MIDI]] editor. This allowed the director to immediately appreciate the approximate sound of the music, its mood and tempo. Then, using a metronome, individual instrument parts, vocals, chorus and parts were recorded, in which a whole orchestra was involved.

Choral parts are performed by vocalists of the Moscow Synodal Choir under the direction of the Honored Artist of Russia Aleksei Puzankov, instrumental musicians of the ensemble of soloists of the [[Saint Petersburg Academic Symphony Orchestra|Academic Symphony Orchestra of the Philharmonic]].

'''Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore''' (December 25, 1829 – September 24, 1892) was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[composer]] and [[Military band|bandmaster]] who lived and worked in the [[United States]] after 1848.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  Whilst serving in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Gilmore wrote the lyrics to the song "[[When Johnny Comes Marching Home]]."  This was published under the pseudonym Louis Lambert in September 1863.

==Life and career==
Gilmore was born in [[Ballygar]], [[County Galway]]. He started his [[music]] career at age fifteen, and spent time in [[Canada]] with an [[England|English]] band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Gilmore, Patrick Sarsfield|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1848, becoming leader of the Suffolk, [[Boston Brigade Band|Boston Brigade]], and Salem bands in swift succession. He also worked in the Boston music store of [[John P. Ordway]] and founded [[Ordway's Aeolians]], a group of [[blackface]] [[Minstrel show|minstrel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/fiddlers/SAIL_SALLO.htm Gilmore as minstrel player]&lt;/ref&gt; With the Salem Band, Gilmore performed at the 1857 inauguration of President [[James Buchanan]].

[[Image:Front Piazza of Grand Hotel, 4 P.M. with Gilmore's Boston Band, Saratoga, N.Y, by Hall Bros..jpg|thumb|left|"Front Piazza of [[Grand Union Hotel (Saratoga Springs, New York)|Grand Hotel]], 4 P.M. with Gilmore's Boston Band, [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga, N.Y.]]," mid-19th century]]

In 1858 he founded "Gilmore's Band," and at the outset of war the band enlisted with the [[24th Massachusetts Volunteers]], accompanying [[Ambrose Burnside|General Burnside]] to [[North Carolina]]. After the temporary discharge of bands from the field, [[John Albion Andrew|Governor Andrew]] of Massachusetts entrusted Gilmore with the task of re-organizing military music-making, and General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] created him Bandmaster-general.

When peace resumed, Gilmore was asked to organize a celebration, which took place at [[New Orleans]].  That success emboldened him to undertake two major music festivals at Boston, the [[National Peace Jubilee]] in 1869 and the [[World's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival]] in 1872.  These featured monster orchestras of massed bands&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Gilmore, Patrick Sarsfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the finest singers and instrumentalists (including the only American appearance by "[[waltz|waltz king]]" [[Johann Strauss II]]) and cemented Gilmore's reputation as the leading musical figure of the age.  Coliseums were erected for the occasions, holding 60- and 120,000 persons. Grateful Bostonians presented Gilmore with medals and cash, but in 1873 he moved to [[New York City]], as bandmaster of the 22nd Regiment.  Gilmore took this band on acclaimed tours of Europe.

It was back on home soil, preparing an 1892 musical celebration of the [[quadricentennial]] anniversary of [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage of discovery, that Gilmore collapsed and died in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=A Noted Bandmaster Gone.

{{listen|filename=Famous 22nd Regiment March - U.S. Marine Band.ogg|title=Famous 22nd Regiment March|description=Gilmore's "Famous 22nd Regiment March" (1874), played by the [[United States Marine Band]]}}
In many ways Gilmore can be seen as the principal figure in 19th-century American music. He was a composer, the "Famous 22nd Regiment March" from 1874 is just one example.  He held the first "Promenade Concert in America" in 1855, the forerunner to today's [[Boston Pops]].  He set up "Gilmore's Concert Garden", which became [[Madison Square Garden (1879)|Madison Square Garden]].  He was the Musical Director of the Nation in effect, leading the festivities for the 1876 Centennial celebrations in Philadelphia and the dedication of the [[Statue of Liberty]] in 1886. In 1888 he started the tradition of seeing in the [[New Year]] in [[Times Square]].  {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1891, he played for  some of [[Thomas Edison]]'s first commercial recordings. Musically, he was the first arranger to set brass instruments against the reeds, which remains the basis for [[big band]] orchestration. His arrangements of contemporary classics did a great deal to familiarize the American people with the work of the great European musical masters. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970.

'''Personal Audio Pty Ltd,''' incorporated on 1 March 2007, is a provider of 3D audio technology solutions applied into [[video games]], music listening and [[VOIP]] telecommunications. The company focuses principally on solutions that are complementary to existing technologies and leverages off the research originally carried out at the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The company has received seed investment from Allen and Buckeridge{{fact|date=August 2014}} and is headquartered in Sydney.  

==MyEars Surround Audio==
Their first product, MyEars, launched in beta test on 14 July 2010,&lt;ref name="PCWorld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/353333/3d_audio_serenade_gamers|title=3D audio to serenade gamers|author=Spandas Lui|date=4 January 2015|work=PC World|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a web based audio profiling service that creates 7.1 [[surround sound]] over headphones that is individualised to the listener. The [[3D audio effect]] rendering process is quite standard;{{fact|date=August 2014}} however, the profiling service uses a hearing localisation test to make a prediction of the ear shape of the listener and generates individualized Head Related Transfer Functions ([[HRTF]]s) for the right and left ears. These are downloaded to the user's gaming PC. The audio rendering is carried out using [[FMOD]] by Firelight Technology using either a dedicated client (MyEars-Connect) that sits between the video game and the operating system or directly in-game if FMOD is utilised as the game audio engine.

The MyEars service completed beta testing in early September and was launched on 19 September 2010. Reviews have been generally positive.&lt;ref name = "GameOnNet"&gt;[http://games.on.net/article/10009/MyEars_Ears-On_Delivering_3D_Audio_via_Stereo_Headphones Test Review of MyEars on game.on.net ([[Internode ISP]].])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APC"&gt;[http://apcmag.com/amazing-sound-for-gamers  Comparison between MyEars and Dolby Headphone ([[APC (magazine)]]]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Junglistpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamearena.com.au/videos/latest.php/bigpond-gamearena-5-inch-floppy-4--my-ears|title=Gaming on Google Play|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815131921/http://www.gamearena.com.au/videos/latest.php/bigpond-gamearena-5-inch-floppy-4--my-ears#|archive-date=15 August 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development has been cited by the International Society for Presence Research&lt;ref name= "ISPR"&gt;[http://sct.temple.edu/blogs/ispr/2010/11/19/myears-improves-gaming-surround-sound/ MyEars in "Presence in the News"]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Presence (telepresence)]]).

'''Privateer Press''' is a [[role-playing game]], [[miniature wargaming|miniature wargame]], [[acrylic paint]], [[board game]] and [[card game]] production and publishing studio. Privateer Press is based in [[Bellevue, Washington]], [[United States]], where they have their headquarters and American factory/distribution center. They have also licensed a factory in the [[United Kingdom]] to increase production capacity for worldwide markets.

The company's signature products are [[Warmachine]] and [[Hordes (game)|Hordes]], tabletop miniatures-based war games with a [[steampunk]]/magical aesthetic. Noted webcomic creators and game critics [[Jerry Holkins]] and [[Mike Krahulik]] of [[Penny Arcade]] are fans of Warmachine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krahilik|first=Mike|title=Corvis Table|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/2011/09/12/corvis-table|publisher=penny-arcade.com|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privateer Press used to publish a house magazine called No Quarter.&lt;ref&gt;https://privateerpress.com/no-quarter-prime/farewell-to-no-quarter-prime&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2000, [[Matt Wilson (artist)|Matt Wilson]] formed Privateer Press with friend [[Brian Snoddy]] and writer Matt Staroscik to publish their own [[D20 System|d20]] books.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|392}} [[Mike McVey]] joined the partnership early on as Miniatures Director. Wilson and Snoddy produced the covers and interior art for Privateer's first [[Iron Kingdoms]] adventures published in 2001.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|392}} The company is currently owned by Wilson due to the departure of Snoddy and McVey.

After their first five RPG books, Privateer's next publication was ''[[Warmachine|Warmachine: Prime]]'' (2003), a miniatures combat game set in the Iron Kingdoms.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|392}} In 2009 Privateer announced a partnership with WhiteMoon Dreams intended to bring ''Warmachine'' to video game consoles.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;{{rp|393}}

On October 20, 2017, Privateer Press created Black Anchor Heavy Industries, an in-house production team to create huge based models while limiting production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://privateerpress.com/community/privateer-insider/insider-10-20-2017|title=Insider 10-20-2017 {{!}} Privateer Press|website=privateerpress.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 after 12 years of publication Privateer Press announced it would be ending publication of their bi-monthly magazine, "No Quarter".

==Charitable contributions==
The company has been a longtime supporter of [[Child's Play (charity)|Child's Play]], a charity which gives toys and games to sick kids in children's hospitals around the world. In 2009, Privateer Press bid on and won an item at the annual Child's Play Holiday auction, donated by [[Harmonix]], which brought them the rights to commission a downloadable song track for the ''[[Rock Band]]'' game. The resulting song "Warmachine," written by Jerry Holkins, premiered at [[Penny Arcade Expo|Pax]] 2010 and was made available for download that fall. All proceeds from the track are also donated to Child's Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holkins|first=Jerry|title=warmachine-precipice|url=http://penny-arcade.com/2010/10/06/warmachine-precipice|publisher=penny-arcade.com|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Polo|first=Susana|title=PAX Is Awesome #543: If You’re Good at Rock Band, You Might Open the Omegathon|url=http://www.geekosystem.com/pax-warmachine-rock-band-song/|publisher=geekosystem.com|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Matt|title=Insider 9/8/2010|url=http://privateerpress.com/community/privateer-insider/insider-9/8/2010|publisher=privateerpress.com|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the sixth entry in the ''[[Professor Layton]]'' series, making up the third and final part of the prequel trilogy of games and according to Level 5 CEO [[Akihiro Hino]], it will be the last Layton title to star [[Professor Hershel Layton|Layton]] himself as the protagonist. The game saw a release in early to late 2013 in all territories except North America, where it was released on February 28 of the following year.

==Story==
{{see also|List of Professor Layton characters}}
Following the conclusion of ''[[Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask]]'', the Azran Legacies, the relics of an ancient civilization, are now possessed by a mysterious organization called Targent, which wishes to use the Azran's untold power for itself. In addition, Jean Descole, Targent's rival, also wishes to harness the power of the Azran Legacies, thus setting the stage as the conflict for the Legacies unfolds. The story begins with Layton, Luke, and Emmy boarding the airship Bostonius. They discuss the letter they received from Professor Desmond Sycamore, an eminent archaeologist, who tells the professor that he had found a so-called living "mummy". They travel to Froenborg, where they meet Sycamore and Aurora, a girl frozen in ice. After solving a puzzle that frees her from the ice, she is captured by Targent, which is led by a man named Leon Bronev. Targent's agents then escape with Aurora onboard their zeppelin, and Layton, Luke, Emmy, Sycamore, and Raymond, Sycamore's butler, give chase in the Bostonius. Layton and Luke rescue her and find she has lost her memory before Layton accidentally drops her as they are flying over forest woodland.

The allies realize they are in the town of Kodh, and the next chapter follows their escapade through the town to find Aurora. When they first see Aurora, she appears to be walking on water, but Layton figures that there is ice underneath the ocean which can be used as stepping stones. They eventually make their way across the lake to Aurora and find her speaking mysterious word in an unknown language. Her words open an Azran chamber located under the huge lake surrounding Kodh. There, they find that they must recover the five Azran eggs, scattered around the world by an ancient Azran leader, to unlock the Azran Legacy.

To prepare for their global expedition, Layton, Luke, Emmy, Aurora, and Sycamore depart for London. The intention is to stock up on necessary supplies, but they meet Inspector Grosky, who is also investigating Targent. They then investigate a case where the local museum had been robbed of several archaeological artifacts, and they uncover Targent's involvement as well as that someone in the London police force was involved in the crime. Layton then identifies the perpetrator as Detective Inspector Leonard Bloom and, having recently become aware of Targent, is able to expose him as an agent of Targent. As a result, Bloom is arrested, and the allies are free to embark upon their expedition. However, Targent continues to pursue them.

Layton's group travels to five different locations to acquire the eggs, each town requiring their aid. In the jungle village of Phong Gi, the chief of the tribe is only willing to give his egg to them if they can make him laugh. Layton eventually realizes he is blind and handcrafts some glasses for him; in return, he is given the egg. In the tropical town of San Grio, the party learns that the egg (nicknamed the "Popoño") is passed around the townsfolk as part of a tradition. In the desert ghost town of Torrido, an old wolf who has the egg keeps attacking, but in reality, the wolf is merely trying to visit an old friend from many years ago. In the windy village of Hoogland, the group learns of a tradition where a young woman is seemingly sacrificed in order to appease a wind god but discover there is an Azran machine, currently broken, that is creating the stormy winds. After fixing the machine, the townsfolk give them the egg. Finally, in the walled-off city of Mossinia, Layton and company find themselves in a mystery after learning all of the adults are comatose. After successfully filling the waterways in the town, the adults are revived, and the party receives the final egg.

After retrieving the five eggs, Aurora attempts to unlock her true power and regain all of her memories, but soon finds out one of the eggs is a fake. They head back to the Azran dome in Kodh and find out the last egg was there previously, but it was taken by Targent, and a fake one was put in its place. Layton, Luke, Emmy, Aurora, and Sycamore fly to Targent's base of operations called the Nest to retrieve the final egg. On the way, they meet up with an archaeologist from Kodh who attempts to hijack Targent's airship, but he ultimately succumbs to his injuries sustained by Targent. He is taken away from the Nest to be hospitalized by two former Targent agents, and the group makes it to the Obsidian Tower located at the heart of the Nest. They scale the tower and make it to the top, reaching Bronev's office. There, Bronev offers Layton a spot on Targent, which Layton declines. The two then proceed to play a game for the last egg, with Layton coming out as the victor. Before he hands the egg though, Bronev shows Layton video footage of his parents, Lucille and Roland. He then proceeds to threaten their lives if Layton does not join Targent. Prompts by Sycamore allow Layton to decline the offer once again, and Bronev leaves the Nest while the group takes the final egg.

Ultimately, the five keys join together to form a master key. Sycamore suddenly betrays the professor, revealing himself to have been Descole the entire time. After a fight between Layton and Descole, Descole steals the key and flees to Froenborg. The group goes on without him back to Froenborg's cave where they first found Aurora. There, Layton, Luke, and Emmy attempt to stop Bronev, but Emmy follows suit in betraying the professor, revealing that she had been working for her "uncle" Leon Bronev all along as she seizes Luke and threatens to kill him with an icicle. After they steal the key to the Azran sanctuary from Descole, Emmy and Bronev take Aurora into the bowels of the sanctuary, intending to use her power to unlock what they perceive to be the "Azran legacy". With these revelations, Descole forms an alliance with Layton to fight the common enemy. It is further revealed that, although Emmy was raised by Bronev, she is not truly evil, nor is Bronev the man she remembers. It seems to her that the Azran Legacy is all he lives for, and he will sacrifice anyone to uncover it. To this end, she wants the professor to reform Bronev however he can and leaves Luke behind, hoping this act will achieve this goal. Together, Layton, Luke, and Descole take turns solving puzzles to pursue Bronev through the sanctuary. Upon saving Luke's life at the expense of injury and near-death, Descole reveals his true identity as Layton's older brother, who was separated from him at a young age when their parents - their father is Leon Bronev himself - were kidnapped by Targent. Layton then recalls memories that he involuntarily suppressed when he was very young: Descole was born Hershel Bronev but gave his first name to his little brother before they were adopted so the latter could be adopted by the Layton family and grow up a happy life without remembering the Bronev family history. Descole's malice towards Layton was merely to prevent him from being hurt as a result of getting in the way of Targent, against which he holds a personal vendetta.

When Bronev unlocks the "legacy" by stabbing Aurora through the heart within the "Chamber of Light" at the center of the Azran sanctuary, the Azran legacy is revealed to be not a source of great power, as Bronev had expected, but to be the resting place of the Golems, an advanced race created by the Azran that became sentient and declared war on the Azran, ultimately becoming the reason for the Azrans' demise; as such, their creators froze them away in ice in order to prevent this from happening again. Aurora reveals that she is a Golem herself, created to be the emissary of the Azran, the one who would judge the worth of the human race in the future. The unleashing of the Golems by Bronev has erased all of mankind's worth in the eyes of the Azran, leading Aurora to order a devastating attack on Froenborg and the Targent military. She soon wakes up, though, distraught at the atrocities happening around her. To prevent mankind's annihilation, Layton, Luke, Emmy, Descole, and ultimately Bronev all sacrifice themselves to stop the procedure by stepping in beams of light, activating the procedure and killing them all. Saddened, Aurora begs the Azran spirits to take her instead, which they do after she solves a death-reversing puzzle, reviving the group and causing the sanctuary to crumble from the sky into Lake Kodh. Before her self-destruction, Aurora thanks Layton and Luke for everything they've done and states that she cherished every moment spent with them. She leaves telling Luke that she hopes she can be reborn as a human. As the sanctuary crumbles, Layton, Luke, Emmy, and Bronev fall to earth on one piece of the sanctuary, while Descole does so on another, bidding farewell to his brother.

Bronev is apprehended by the police, after informing Layton that his real name is, in fact, Theodore Bronev, not Hershel Layton. Layton denies this and wishes to keep his adoptive name, refusing to recognize Bronev as his real father. Layton states that, to him, his parents are Roland and Lucille, but he hopes that he and Bronev can meet again as friends and fellow archaeologists one day.

Back in London, Emmy bids an emotional farewell to Layton, passing the role of his assistant to Luke, and promises to return when she is worthy of her place as Layton's assistant once again. Descole is last seen having apparently survived the collapse of the Azran sanctuary as he flies away with Raymond on a restored Bostonius, searching for a new purpose in life. The game ends with Luke and Layton driving in the countryside as they plan to solve an inheritance dispute. As Luke looks through the window, the village of St. Mystere appears on the horizon, setting up the plot for ''[[Professor Layton and the Curious Village]]''.

Some [[Nigeria|Nigerian]] [[prostitute]]s ply their trade on the [[Niger]] border as many prostitutes are persecuted in their homeland and Niger is perceived as being more amiable and less likely to prosecute them for their trade.&lt;ref name="indy" /&gt; Nigerian men prefer to cross the border to seek sex as the punishment in [[Islam|Islamic]] Nigeria is 50 lashes for "procuration of woman".&lt;ref name="indy" /&gt;

In 2017 the government ordered a clampdown on prostitution throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court convicts 11 prostitutes in Niger - Vanguard News|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/02/court-convicts-11-prostitutes-niger/|website=Vanguard News|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Niger}}
Niger is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Victims from [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Ghana]], [[Mali]], Nigeria, and [[Togo]] are exploited in sex trafficking in Niger. Corrupt [[marabouts]] or loosely organised clandestine networks may also place Nigerien girls into commercial sex. Nigerien girls are subjected to sex trafficking along the border with Nigeria, sometimes with the complicity of their families. In the [[Tahoua Department|Tahoua region]] of Niger, some girls in forced marriages may be exploited in commercial sex after fleeing these nominal unions.  In [[Algeria]], Nigerien women and girls were vulnerable to sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Niger 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271254.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerien women and children are recruited from Niger and transported to Nigeria, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Europe]] where they are subjected to sex trafficking. Some migrants were suspected to be traffickers, particularly Nigerien migrants to Algeria. Traffickers operated primarily small, freelance operations in loosely organised networks of individuals, including some marabouts. There have been reports of freelance business people (both men and women) and informal travel agencies that recruit women to the Middle East or to northern Nigeria for sex trafficking. Niger is a transit country for women and children from [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]] migrating to North Africa and [[Western Europe]], where some are subjected to sex trafficking. In some instances, law enforcement and border officials have accepted bribes from traffickers to facilitate the transportation of victims through the country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Niger as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

It is also the home of Regal Radio, and it has its own animation company called Regal Animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regalanimation.co.uk/ |title=Regal Animation |work=www.regalanimation.co.uk |accessdate=2017-01-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230090206/http://www.regalanimation.co.uk/ |archivedate=2016-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visitwestlothian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visitwestlothian.co.uk/see-do/arts-culture/the-regal-community-theatre/|title=The Regal Community Theatre|work=www.visitwestlothian.co.uk|accessdate=2017-01-04|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210142334/http://visitwestlothian.co.uk/see-do/arts-culture/the-regal-community-theatre/|archivedate=2016-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visitscotland.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/bathgate-p241321 |title=Bathgate |work= Visit Scotland|accessdate=2017-01-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922170523/https://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/bathgate-p241321 |archivedate=2017-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Mn6CIquMOA|title=STV Live at 5: Bathgate Regal 01/12/2016|first=|last=Regal Theatre|date=2 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2017|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922170523/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Mn6CIquMOA|archivedate=22 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ci-3mB1MO4|title=STV E...: Scott Kyle and the Regal 02/12/2016|first=|last=Regal Theatre|date=2 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2017|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922170523/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ci-3mB1MO4|archivedate=22 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visitwestlothian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="visitscotland.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/comedy-course-set-run-bathgates-5659708|title=Comedy course set to run in Bathgate's Regal Theatre|first=Debbie|last=Hall|date=8 May 2015|website=dailyrecord.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211171044/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/comedy-course-set-run-bathgates-5659708|archivedate=11 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/bathgates-regal-theatre-host-annual-4983931|title=Bathgate's Regal Theatre to host annual Short Scottish Film Festival|first=Allan|last=Valente|date=15 January 2015|website=dailyrecord.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202020131/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/bathgates-regal-theatre-host-annual-4983931|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/regal-theatre-set-launch-new-8876091|title=Regal Theatre set to launch new animation department at the weekend|first=Debbie|last=Hall|date=21 September 2016|website=dailyrecord.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230090355/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/regal-theatre-set-launch-new-8876091|archivedate=30 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/whats-on/tv-and-film/animator-takes-kirkcaldy-film-to-big-screen-1-4224796|title=Animator takes Kirkcaldy film to big screen|website=www.fifetoday.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230090010/http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/whats-on/tv-and-film/animator-takes-kirkcaldy-film-to-big-screen-1-4224796|archivedate=30 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.westlothian.gov.uk/article/7531/Slimming-World-at-Bathgate-Regal|title=Slimming World at Bathgate Regal|website=www.westlothian.gov.uk|accessdate=22 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519123416/http://www.westlothian.gov.uk/article/7531/Slimming-World-at-Bathgate-Regal|archivedate=19 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishtheatre.org/projects-services/touring-resources/1875/bathgate-regal?destination=node/537?all=1&amp;type=tresource|title=Bathgate Regal - Federation of scottish theatre|website=www.scottishtheatre.org|accessdate=22 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922170523/http://www.scottishtheatre.org/projects-services/touring-resources/1875/bathgate-regal?destination=node%2F537%3Fall%3D1&amp;type=tresource|archivedate=22 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-storey theatre is located on North Bridge Street in the centre of Bathgate. The [[Art Deco]] building is located on a flattened slope. The entrance front faces south and has five [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]s. It is decorated with plasterwork, colossal [[pilaster|pilasters]] and stylized keystones. The outer, two-storey elements stand out in particular, with the colourful-lettered REGAL logo adorning the façade. The building has a flat-roof structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathgateregal.org/|title=Home|website=Regal Community Theatre|accessdate=22 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710153412/http://www.bathgateregal.org/|archivedate=10 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;

The floor of the foyer is decorated with terrazzo tiles, and the ceiling is decorated with plasterwork. The original stained glass windows are partially preserved, the interior still showing the building's original purpose. The foyer is flanked by stairs that lead to the gallery and the upstairs bar. The lower parts of the walls are decorated with walnut veneer. Small exhibition rooms have been set up on both the ground floor and the second floor. The gallery on the second floor has been turned into an office.&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/188259/bathgate-24-34-north-bridge-street-regal-cinema|title=Bathgate,  24 - 34 North Bridge Street, Regal Cinema - Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|accessdate=22 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527231815/http://canmore.org.uk/site/188259/bathgate-24-34-north-bridge-street-regal-cinema|archivedate=27 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Scavenius''''' is a [[tower defense]], developed by Danish studio Flamefusion Entertainment and released in 2011.

==Gameplay==
The player must stop a set number of enemies, known in the genre as "creeps" from reaching a set point on the playing field. This is accomplished by building  towers that shoot at, damage and kill the enemy creeps before they are able to reach their objective. Unlike many other tower defense games, the path of the creeps themselves is not set; instead, the towers built determine the path of the creeps, who take the shortest path they can find to the exit. The game does not allow the player to make an exit completely inaccessible, but key strategies revolve around guiding creeps into lengthy, meandering corridors.

The creeps come in waves at set intervals. Each wave of creeps has different characteristics defined by the map. Several times during gameplay, boss waves may appear depending on the map creator's implementation decisions.

The player begins with a set number of lives (again, defined by the map), and loses X number of lives for each creep that survives to reach its goal (depending on the defined impact of every creep in that map). The game will end early in defeat if the player′s lives reach zero, and it provides no way to regenerate lost lives.

==Maps and customizability&lt;ref&gt;http://ingamable.com/scavenius&lt;/ref&gt;==
The game is played on a chosen map in the game. Maps can be created by players in the game through the inbuilt map-editor. In general, the maps define the game itself by defining basically all of the functionality.

==Updates==
Several updates are being worked on. One of these updates is promised to deliver a map-cloud sharing system which will allow players to rate other maps and upload their own.&lt;ref&gt;http://impulsedriven.com/scavenius2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamestop.com/pc/games/scavenius-2/98560&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, new maps will be added including the "Wintermaul V5" map - a famous map from the Warcraft III universe. On top of this, multiplayer gameplay will be a part of the game.&lt;ref&gt;http://ingamable.com/scavenius&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonic''') is a [[Spain|Spanish]] coin-operated amusement machines company established by [[Sega]] Enterprises-related shareholders in March 1968. By 1972, the company was a pioneer of the import of the video [[arcade games]] to Europe, starting with ''[[Pong]]'', followed by ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Galaxian]]'' and ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. They produced [[pinball]] machines between 1972 and 1986.&lt;ref name=ia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/manuf_detail.php?manuf_id=1005|title=The International Arcade Museum|publisher=TIAM|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, they imported American pinball machines during the sixties and seventies and later decided to make their own. Their most successful pinball machines were produced under the brand name SONIC and include "American horror".

A '''telecommunications lease''' is a lease that exists between a [[telecommunications]] provider or wireless company, and a landowner. Similar to other real estate leases, a telecommunications lease is put in place as an agreement to lease space on the landowner’s property for a telecommunications site or [[cellular tower]] for a specified length of time. In exchange for the use of space, the telecommunications provider (also referenced as a tenant) agrees to pay the landowner (a monthly or annual) rent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tallents.co.uk/index.php/helping-landowners-understand-telecoms-lease-agreements "Helping landowners understand telecoms lease agreements"] "Talents Solicitors", May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Telecom leases can be excellent sources of ancillary income, in some cases providing the landowner with thousands of dollars per month.

== Industry growth ==

The telecommunication industry is growing as the need for [[4G]] and [[5G]] networks flourishes.  As a result of this growth there is a constant demand for cellular networks to increase their coverage. Therefore, more cellular towers are constructed and more leases are drawn up between the cellular provider and landowners, which can include municipalities and private landowners, such as homeowners.

== Types of leases ==

In the telecommunications industry, there are two types of telecommunications leases: a rooftop lease agreement and a ground lease agreement. In some cases, cellular sites are installed on the roofs of commercial office buildings and even residential living complexes. These rooftop installations take advantage of the height of the buildings on which they are installed to provide quality cellular coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipsnizer.com/publications/articles/rooftopleasesbachnerbeller_art.cfm "Mining the Roof: An article on telecommunication rooftop installations and leases"] "Phillips Nizer LLP Articles", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/churches-and-cell-towers_n_2211818.html | title=Churches And Cell Towers: Antennas Find Unexpected New Home | publisher=The Huffington Post | date=29 November 2012 | accessdate=16 November 2014 | author=Taggart, Kendall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground leases, on the other hand are contracts typically made between the cellular provider and the landowner of a property for space at the ground level on which a cellular tower is installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/248366/landlord+tenant+leases/Ground+Lease+Characteristics+Lender+Issues "Canada: Ground Lease Characteristics - Lender Issues"] "Mondaq", July 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rooftop leases ===
Rooftops are leased for many different communication purposes, including many different types of antennas.  Panel antennas are commonly placed on rooftops in urban and densely populated residential areas.  These antennas typically range from 1–10 feet in height and have the ability to service multiple technologies, including: cellular antennas, PCS antennas, specialized mobile radios, fixed wireless services, and paging services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccim.com/cire-magazine/articles/telecommunications-talk "New Technologies Bring New Revenue for Property Owners Who Know the Issues"] "CCIM Institute"&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite dishes are also mounted on some rooftops, primarily for satellite TV service, but in other cases much larger dishes are used.  These antennas generally address Internet and cable needs and therefore are used for services such as video conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accuplan.net/selfdirectedirablog/self-directed-ira/cell-phone-towers/ "The Vertical Investment: What You Should Know About Cell Towers"] "Accuplan", November 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooftop leases include details about the amount of space leased, installation methods, and upgrade procedures that allow the tenant to operate at the site as needed, while protecting the landlords building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rooftop Antenna Leases|url=http://www.gunnersonconsulting.com/rooftop-leases|publisher=Gunnerson Consulting|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ground leases ===

Ground leases generally address antenna towers or [[billboards]] in which the landowner leases the space, or land, to the cellular provider to build the tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mctexlaw.com/atf-leases.asp "Leases Generally"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704050544/http://www.mctexlaw.com/atf-leases.asp |date=2012-07-04 }} "McTexLaw", 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Antenna towers range between 50 and 300 feet tall.  These large, free standing cellular towers can sometimes be “disguised” to blend in with the natural architecture of the building or the surrounding landscape. An example of this is a church property that may have a tower built to resemble, or in some cases built into an existing steeple. Alternatively, a property owner for another type of property may have a monopine or monopalm cellular structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentalintegration.com/products-concealment.htm "Camouflage and Concealment Products"] "Environmental Integration"&lt;/ref&gt; These are built to resemble pine or palm trees respectively.

Cellular providers such as [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[AT&amp;T]] most commonly use ground leases.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

== Components ==

=== Location ===

=== Zoning ===
Proposals for new [[cell tower]]s sometimes face public opposition in zoning proceedings from residents who raise aesthetic objections and fear health hazards.&lt;ref&gt;John Larson, [http://www.tacomaweekly.com/news/article/cell_tower_draws_resistance Cell tower draws resistance], ''Tacoma Weekly'' (April 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shelby Carignan, [https://bangordailynews.com/2014/08/15/news/portland/proposed-scarborough-zoning-change-to-allow-cell-towers-near-homes-with-poor-reception-hits-snag/ Proposed Scarborough zoning change to allow cell towers near homes with poor reception hits snag], ''Bangor Daily News'' (August 15, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dys, [http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/andrew-dys/article54797320.html Clover residents rail against 180-foot cell tower - zoning board approves it anyway], ''[[The Herald (Rock Hill)|The Herald]]'' (January 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Local zoning boards must follow the rules set forth in the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://transition.fcc.gov/telecom.html Telecommunications Act of 1996], Federal Communication Commission, May 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which sets guidelines for what are acceptable reasons to not permit the construction of a new cellular tower.

=== Redundancy ===

Generally cellular providers look for property that is in a densely populated area and that falls outside of a five-mile radius from the nearest tower.  For a cellular company, redundancy occurs when two or more towers serve the same area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.best-portable-gps.net/what-will-happen-to-my-cell-tower-lease-if-att-acquires-t-mobile/ "What will happen to my cell tower lease if AT&amp;T acquires T-Mobile?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216122512/http://www.best-portable-gps.net/what-will-happen-to-my-cell-tower-lease-if-att-acquires-t-mobile/ |date=2013-12-16 }} "Best Portable GPS", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  This often causes a loss of income for the cellular provider, as they generally need one tower rather than multiple.  As companies continue to merge, redundancy has become a rising issue within the telecommunication industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wirelessinvestmentgroup.com/how-much-is-my-cell-tower-lease-worth.php "How Much Is My Cell Tower Lease Worth?"] "Cell Tower Lease Buyout Experts", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duration and termination ===

Generally, telecom leases are for an initial five-year term followed by additional five-year renewal terms.  Leases typically also have a 30- to 90-day cancellation period when the cellular provider has the right to terminate the lease within 30 to 90 days of giving notice to the landowner.  This specific portion of a telecom lease is due to recent mergers in the industry, which render some towers useless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nilesbarton.com/articles/tips-for-negotiating-a-rooftop-antenna-lease "Tips For Negotiating a Rooftop Antenna Lease"] "Niles, Barton &amp; Wilmer LLP", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to cellular providers merging with other cellular companies, one company can double its number of towers.  This often causes redundancy, as previously mentioned, which often leads to the termination of leases and removal of redundant towers.

=== Fair market value ===

The [[fair market value]] of a lease is generally determined by the importance of the location to the cellular carrier's network, or the value of the coverage the location provides. Value will also be driven by the availability of surrounding alternate sites. Determining the fair market value of a cellular lease is difficult for most landowners due to lack of available information. Cell tower lease rates are not public information, and these rates vary widely. There are however companies that specialize in providing information and assistance to property owners in this highly specialized field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cell Tower Lease Rates|url=http://www.gunnersonconsulting.com/cell-tower-lease-rates|website=Gunnerson Consulting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to make money, cellular carriers often undervalue a lease.  Leasing agents typically receive bonuses for signing low-priced leases, and therefore undervalue leases because the worse the deal is for the landowner, the greater the benefits are for the leasing agent. There are several methods for a landowner to evaluate their property:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Odom|first1=Hugh|title=Cell Tower Lease Rates – How Much and Why?|url=http://www.celltowerleaseexperts.com/increase-rates/cell-tower-lease-rates/|publisher=Vertical Consultants|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Are there cell towers owned by the cellular company near by?
#Is your property located in a densely populated area?
#Is there a high demand for cellular coverage near your property?

=== Footprint ===

=== Collocation ===
[[Cellular collocation|Collocation]] is when the cellular company allows other companies to build on their tower.  As a result, the cellular company that owns the tower receives a rent from the co-locators.

=== Cell tower lease buyout ===

Property owners have the ability to sell their cell tower lease separate from their parcel. Investors purchase the cell tower lease as an easement or lease assignment. Three main factors that influence cell tower buyout prices are: current rent, the rent escalator, and the date of lease expiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.airwaveadvisors.com/cell-tower-lease-buyout/ | title=Cell Tower Lease Buyouts | publisher=Airwave Advisors | accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of cell tower lease buyout offers have  different implications for landowners. For example, a cell tower lease buyout on farmland is much different than the purchase of a lease on a building rooftop. Some necessary considerations for cell tower lease buyout transactions are:{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}
* Access requirements.
* Tax implications. (easement vs. lease assignment)
* Property redevelopment rights.
* For rooftop sites, how is property damage addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cell Tower Lease Buyouts|url=https://www.airwaveadvisors.com/cell-tower-lease-buyout/|publisher=Airwave Advisors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenges of selling a cellular leasehold is the acquisition market is highly unregulated.  Lease Acquisition agents have the ability to modify and deliver information to the landowner to acquire leaseholds at a highly discounted price.   Similar the oil barons of the 1800s, these agents are compensated heavily to obtain these rights, and often the underlying value of expiration and an expanded sale market is shielded from the landowner.

State-run station [[TVRI]] held a [[television]] [[monopoly]] in [[Indonesia]] until 1989, when the first commercial station, [[RCTI]] (Rajawali Citra Televisi Indonesia) began as a local station and was subsequently granted a national license a year later.

Each of the networks have a wide variety of programmes, ranging from traditional shows, such as ''[[wayang]]'' performances, to programmes like ''[[Indonesian Idol]]'' which are based on Western models. One typical television show common to almost every network is ''sinetron''&lt;ref&gt;''Sinetron is an abbreviation from an Indonesian phrasedenotind "electronic cinema".&lt;/ref&gt; Sinetron is usually a drama series, following the [[soap opera]] format, but can also refer to any fictional [[TV series|series]]. Sometimes it can be comedic, like the popular [[Auto rickshaw|Bajaj]] Bajuri series, featuring a ''bajaj'' driver and the people he drives around.

==History==
[[File:TVRITower.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[TVRI]] head office, the first TV station in Indonesia.]]
The first time the Indonesian public witnessed the demonstration of a television was in 1955, 29 years after its introduction in 1926, and 26 years after the world's first television broadcast was made in 1929. These first televisions were brought from the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Yogyakarta]] 200 years anniversary fair (''Pekan Raja 200 Tahun Kota Djogjakarta'').&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D"&gt;Dicky. Kompas Research and Development. ''Kompas''. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 1961, the Minister of Information, [[R. Maladi]], signed an agreement (''SK Menpen'') to create a committee for the preparation of the establishment of television in Indonesia. This was established as a part of the preparation for the [[1962 Asian Games|fourth Asian Games]]. There was only a year to create a studio, broadcast tower, and other technical equipments in the former site of the Information Academy at Senayan. In that short period of preparation, Soekarno had a very prominent role, going as far as to personally choosing the equipment and where they should be imported from. The first experimental TV broadcast was the live coverage of the celebration of the 17th Anniversary of Indonesia's Independence on the morning August 17, 1962 from Jakarta's [[Merdeka Palace]].&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

At 14.30, August 24, 1962, the citizens of Jakarta witnessed the live broadcast of the opening ceremony of the 4th Asian Games from [[Gelora Bung Karno]]. This broadcast was held by the Television Division of the Radio and Television Organizing Committee Bureau. This day is now recognized as the birth of ''[[TVRI|Televisi Republik Indonesia]]'' or TVRI, the first television station in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

On October 20, 1963, the government issued a Presidential Decision (''Keppres'') regarding the formation of the TVRI Foundation (''Jajasan TVRI'') as its governing body. In the first year of the TVRI broadcast, there are 10,000 television owners in Indonesia. Since then, the Foundation allotted a tax for television-owners until 1969, when the television property tax was transferred through mail and air deliveries nationwide. From 1963 to 1976, TVRI established [[television station]]s in [[Yogyakarta]] (1965), [[Medan]] (1970), [[Makassar]] (1972), [[Balikpapan]] (1973), and [[Palembang]] (1974). In 2001, TVRI has 12 television stations and 8 production studios. Color broadcasting was introduced on September 1, 1979&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt; on TVRI's national and local stations, which expanded to other provincial capitals. TVRI also adopted a second channel for Jakarta viewers at the same time.

Advertisements were introduced to TVRI on March 1, 1963 to cope with the increasing broadcast hours. This advertisement was known as ''Siaran Niaga'' (literally "advertisement broadcast").&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt; Now, television advertisements and other general advertisings are known simply as ''iklan'' ("advertisement").

On August 16, 1976, the Domestic Satellite Communication System (''Sistem Komunikasi Satelit Domestik'' or SKSD) through [[Palapa#Series A|Palapa A1]] was inaugurated. This [[communication satellite]] was the first satellite owned by Indonesia and one of the first satellite operated by a developing country. Palapa A1 had 12 [[transponder]]s which allows TVRI to distribute its broadcast reach nationally.&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt; Thus TVRI entered the 1980s with a two-channel system, the first, TVRI Nasional, being broadcast nationwide with the second channel broadcasting local content from the provinces and Jakarta.

On January 5, 1980, President [[Soeharto]] issued an instruction to remove the ''Siaran Niaga'' advertisements from TVRI.&lt;ref&gt;National Budget Plan 1981/1982 (RAPBN 1981/1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is from the belief that advertisements may create negative effects for the development of Indonesia during that time. This instructions had created pros and cons, especially because there is no research behind this statement. One month later, the Department of Information's Research and Department division decided to perform a research about the effect of advertisements to national development programs aired within the TVRI network.&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt; In March 1980, the ban on commercial advertisements was lifted.

As the only TV station in Indonesia for many years, aside from coverage of state events, sessions of the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] and national holidays, as well as educational programming and regional programs in the many regional languages, TVRI had also broadcast entertainment, child-oriented and sports programmes to suit the needs of the viewing public. As part of the plans of the [[Fifth Development Cabinet]], however, noticing how its ASEAN neighbours had operated private television channels with success (Malaysia had its by then sole private TV channel, TV3, which opened in 1984 and the Philippines and Thailand also had private TV stations in conjunction with the state networks, while TVRI was by then in the same situation as in Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Brunei which all had only a state TV channel), the door was opened for the formation of private television stations and an end to the TVRI monopoly. On August 24, 1989, the second television station in Indonesia, [[RCTI|Rajawali Citra Televisi Indonesia]] or RCTI, was inaugurated. This was the nation's first privately owned television station. The television station was owned by [[Bambang Trihatmodjo]]. Unlike TVRI, RCTI was allowed to broadcast advertisements up to 15% its broadcast hours. On August 24, 1990, the third television station, [[SCTV (Indonesia)|Surya Citra Televisi]] or SCTV, formerly [[Surabaya]] Centra Televisi, was inaugurated. This television station was owned by "king of [[Multiplex (movie theater)|cineplex]]" Sudwikatmono.&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

On September 13, 1990, the president issued Presidential Decree no. 40 regarding the television property tax collection between ''Yayasan TVRI'' and PT Mekatama Raya, a private company owned by Sudwikatmono and Sigit Hardjojudanto. Since the beginning of 1991, this private company was the responsible body to withdraw television property tax from people. The reason for this change is to increase revenue from the lower 1969 post and air mail system.&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

On January 23, 1991, PT Cipta Televisi Pendidikan Indonesia ([[MNCTV|TPI]]) started its broadcast of educational programs with some advertisements. The company was led by [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana|Siti Hardjanti]]. During its first years, TPI shared channels with TVRI and as a blocktimer then with the channel, its facility and operational staff, whenever TVRI did not broadcast, were supported by the channel.&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

On April 14, 1992, the Directorate General of Radio, Television and Films decided that Yayasan TVRI will withdrew back the television property tax from the people when, after one year, PT Mekatama Raya failed to increase the revenue.&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

On October 1992, the Minisrtry of Information issued licenses for six companies to established  private television firms: PT [[Indosiar|Indosiar Visual Mandiri]] or Indosiar ([[Jakarta]]), PT Sanitya Mandara Televisi ([[Yogyakarta]]), PT Merdeka Citra Televisi Indonesia ([[Semarang]]), PT Ramako Indotelevisi ([[Batam]]), [[ANTV|PT Cakrawala Andalas Televisi]] or ANTV ([[Lampung]]), and PT Cakrawala Bumi Sriwijaya Televisi ([[Palembang]]). Of all these six television companies, only PT Indosiar Visual Mandiri and PT Cakrawala Andalas Televisi were able to broadcast continuously. On February 28, 1993, PT Cakrawala Andalas Televisi, a joint venture between [[Agung Laksono]] and the [[Aburizal Bakrie|Bakrie]] family, started its first broadcast. The broadcast station was initially planned to be located in [[Lampung]], but later moved to [[Jakarta]], in a building at [[Kuningan]]. PT Indosiar Visual Mandiri, owned by Salim Group, started its first broadcast on January 11, 1995.&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

In March 1998, TV Kabel [[Indovision]], operated by PT Matahari Lintas Cakrawala under the leadership of [[Peter F. Gontha]], started its operation as the first cable television in Indonesia (the first cable television was operated in the United States in 1972). Previously, since 1996, Indovision had operated using television decoders and [[parabolic antenna]]s.&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

In October 1999, out of fourteen applicants that had been received by Department of Information, five television broadcasting companies passed the selection and received broadcast licenses. These companies are: [[Trans TV]] (PT Televisi Transformasi Indonesia, led by Ishadi, the former head of TVRI), [[MetroTV]] (operated by Grup Media Indonesia which was led by [[Surya Paloh]]), [[Global TV (Indonesia)|Global TV]] (PT Global Informasi Bermutu, established by Timmy Habibie), [[TV ONE (Indonesia)#As Lativi|Lativi]] (PT Lativi Media Karya, owned by [[Abdul Latief]]), and [[Trans7#History|TV7]] (PT Duta Visual Nusantara Tivi Tujuh). Metro TV was the first to broadcast on November 25, 2000, as the seventh Indonesian television channel&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

On June 7, 2000, following the changes after the dissolution of the Department of Information by President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], TVRI was officially able to change its status into a Service Company (''Perusahaan Jawatan'').&lt;ref name="Kompas R&amp;D" /&gt;

The use of Chinese was banned from 1965 to 1994 in Indonesian television, but its use did not come until years later. In November 2000, after more than 3 decades, Metro TV would become the first to broadcast news in [[Mandarin Chinese]] to the Indonesian Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Metro TV breaks Indonesian TV mould | work = Television Asia | publisher = Cahners Business Information | location = [[Singapore]] | page = 8 | date = November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Linguini Incident''''' (released on home video as '''''Shag-O-Rama''''') is a 1991 American [[Crime film|crime]] [[Comedy film|comedy]] film set in [[New York City|New York]] starring [[David Bowie]] and [[Rosanna Arquette]]. The film was directed by [[Richard Shepard]], who co-wrote the script with Tamar Brott.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=March 2016}}
Lucy (Arquette) is a young woman who works at a restaurant in [[Manhattan]]. She is constantly annoyed by her gambling, egotistical bosses. She has an ambition to be an [[Escapology|escape artist]], specifically a modern female version of [[Harry Houdini]], with her best friend, Vivian (Balint) as her assistant. Lucy also collects anything that once belonged to Mrs. Houdini.

The movie starts with Lucy questioning who the new bartender (Bowie) is. She finds out his name is Monte, he's from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and will tell any lie in order to get a woman to [[Marriage|marry]] him. He makes it clear he only wants to marry because he is in dire need of a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]], because if he doesn't and has to go back to Britain, he will surely die. The two chat, with Monte desperately asking Lucy out for breakfast, even though Lucy doesn't want to.

Later on, Lucy is practising an escape trick when she loses her balance and becomes trapped by the [[noose]] she was planning to escape from. Her wrists and ankles are both cuffed, meaning Lucy can't free herself. She cries herself to sleep after having not been able to reach the key that unlocks the cuffs. She is awoken in the morning by a phone call. She struggles to answer it but manages to by kicking the phone onto the ground so she can hear it. It's Monte wanting to take her out for breakfast, having found her number in the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]. Lucy begs him to come to her [[apartment]] to untie her. He frees her legs and unties the noose but will only free her hands on the condition that she marries him. Lucy, unsettled, declines, so Monte handcuffs Lucy to himself and the bed before falling asleep, with an upset Lucy following suit.

Vivian enters the apartment the following morning to find Monte and Lucy asleep on the bed, handcuffed. Vivian unlocks Lucy but leaves the handcuffs on Monte. He later arises and eats a [[marshmallow]] for breakfast whilst the girls whisper in the bathroom about who gets to sleep with him.

Later on, Viv and Lucy ride to an [[antique shop]] where Lucy has her eye on Mrs. Houdini's [[wedding ring]]. Lucy will do anything to have it, but is unable to purchase it, as she doesn't have the $5,000 to pay for it. Lucy wonders how she can get the money. She decides to rob the restaurant after her bosses, Dante (Gregory) and Cecil (Henry) once again decide to fine the waitresses if they don't sell enough [[dessert]]s. Monte is also present at the meeting, with one of his hands still cuffed.

Vivian goes to the restaurant to tell Lucy some big news: a designer is interested in meeting Viv to discuss her line of [[lingerie]]. The only problem is, Viv can only meet with the designer the following day at 3:00. This is a problem because Lucy has an [[audition]] for her escape trick, and Viv is her assistant. After an argument, Vivian storms off to go and talk to Monte, who's serving at the bar. Jealous, Lucy unlocks Monte from the handcuff and agrees to go out with him if he'll be her assistant at the audition; he accepts.

Monte has his doubts about Lucy, so he strikes a deal with Jeanette (Matlin), a [[Hearing loss|deaf]] colleague: Jeanette will marry him if he pays her $10,000. This leads to a conversation Monte has on the phone with his friend. Lucy overhears the conversation and decides to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]]. He explains to his friend his intention to rob the restaurant, and asks his friend to help, who declines.

Lucy confronts Monte while they are waiting for her turn at the audition. Both become frustrated because they both want to rob the [[restaurant]] at the same time. Lucy is called up and begins her escape routine. Unfortunately, the audition goes disastrously as she cannot find the key to free herself. Lucy is obviously upset so Monte takes her to a bar where they discuss who's going to rob the restaurant. They can't work together, as that would mean splitting the money, and Monte needs it all to pay Jeanette. Monte comes up with another plan: he will help Lucy rob the restaurant if she marries him. This way, Monte won't need the $10,000 to pay Jeanette.

Lucy begins to cry again so Monte tries to cheer her up by talking about Mrs. Houdini. Lucy, still upset, explains that Mrs. Houdini was vital to Harry Houdini's escape routines: before Mr. Houdini commenced with his trick, Mrs. Houdini would kiss him and transfer the key he needed to escape from her mouth to his. Lucy's mood has improved somewhat after this so the two walk down the street and discuss the possibility of sleeping together. Monte wants to, but Lucy declines and explains Viv was hoping to sleep with him first. With Viv in mind, he suggests that a third person that doesn't work at the restaurant and wouldn't be recognised would be ideal for the [[robbery]]. Lucy agrees and the two head to Vivian's apartment, where she's working on her 'self-defence bra'.

It's later on when the trio discuss the plan: at 12:00 AM, Viv will enter the restaurant and demand money, which she will take from the register. To appear more threatening, she will carry a [[gun]] which fires blanks. It's vitally important that it happens before the 12:30 AM drop. Monte and Lucy will create some clever [[:wikt:diversion|diversions]] so that the guests will be on edge. At 11:59, they will drop a loud set of glasses to really unsettle the guests; seconds later, Viv will enter. Viv reluctantly agrees and takes the gun from Monte.

At 11:59, Monte and Lucy drop the [[Champagne|champagne bottles]] and glasses... But Viv doesn't show up. Thinking she has dropped out, Monte storms off, and Lucy follows. She finds him in the freezer causing havoc and messing the room up. With [[adrenaline]] rushing through him, he makes out with Lucy. As it turns out, Viv had a flat tyre on her bike, so by the time she turns up in a disguise to commence the robbery the guests are calm and don't take her seriously. She makes [[threat]]s but the guests laugh at her, so she pretends she's a performing artist and the stunt was part of her act.

In the freezer, Lucy flees the room, leaving Monte confused. She tracks down Vivian, who explains what happened. The situation is desperate and 12:30 looms, so Viv fires the gun, exclaiming, 'Sorry, I guess I wasn't kidding... Money. Now. All of it.' Jeanette, who works at the register, can't understand Vivian because the disguise is covering her face. Annoyed, Viv presses a button on her bra, which causes two knife-like spikes to stick out of it. Jeanette is fascinated and happily hands over a bag of money. Lucy and Monte leave the restaurant and later all three of them can be seen throwing money into the air, celebrating.

Expecting Lucy to uphold her side of the deal, Monte heads to the [[Register office|Register Office]] and waits for her. Meanwhile, Lucy heads back to the antique shop to buy the ring, only to find it has been sold. She heads over to Viv's apartment to mope. Viv's in a cheerful mood, however: since the robbery, companies have been calling her about her 'self-defence bra'. Lucy doesn't share the enthusiasm. Viv asks if she and Monte tied the knot. Lucy realises she completely forgot, so she and Vivian rush to the Register Office.

The girls arrive and Monte whisks Lucy away, but they are not able to marry because she left her [[Identity document|I.D.]] at Viv's apartment. There is simply no time to get married any other day, so Monte leaves in anger. The two girls leave, too, and Lucy, full of guilt, confesses to Vivian that she made out with Monte. The two talk about him before deciding to head to a bar and get [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]].

Monte, meanwhile, is at the restaurant when Cecil and Dante approach him. It is revealed that Monte didn't need to get married to get his green card, but because he made a $2,000,000 bet with Cecil and Dante. We also learn that Monte has a terrible [[gambling]] problem. He manages to convince them to give him another chance, and they make another bet: Lucy will have one minute to escape from a [[straitjacket]], hanging upside down, with her feet cuffed, inside a locked canvas bag, underwater (In Cecil and Dante's giant [[aquarium]] at the restaurant). If she is unable to, Monte will owe them $4,000,000, or, he will undergo [[plastic surgery]] to make himself look like Dante.

Of course, Monte can't win without Lucy's help. He arrives at Lucy's apartment, where the two girls are asleep. He wakes them up and discovers they have serious [[hangover]]s. Worried that they won't help him, Monte makes up a story, 'Cecil and Dante know about the robbery... I don't know how they found out... There's still hope. I made a deal- a bet-a bet with Cecil and Dante: if we win, they drop all charges, like nothing ever happened... [If we lose,] 20 years [[Penal labour|hard labour]]'. Vivian and Monte believe that they can train Lucy, but quickly, for the stunt is to be performed the following night. Lucy trains for hours, and before long, the three fall asleep, exhausted. Vivian wakes up in the early hours of the [[morning]] and leaves, which, in turn, causes Monte and Lucy to wake up. Lucy wants to get up and train, but Monte convinces her to stay, and the two make love in Lucy's apartment.

Later in the morning, Lucy is out shopping and sees Cecil and Dante driving past in a [[Taxicab|taxi]]. She tries to avoid them, but they drag her into the vehicle so they can rant about their excitement for the bet. After a bit of chatting, Lucy finds out that Cecil and Dante don't know who committed the robbery, even though Monte told her they knew. She discovers that Monte will have to pay Cecil and Dante $4,000,000 (or get plastic surgery) if he doesn't win the bet, even though Monte told her they'd go to jail if the bet was lost. Lucy is visibly shocked and asks the driver to stop before climbing out of the taxi.

It's the night of the bet and Monte is nervous, particularly because Lucy hasn't showed up. Monte learns that Cecil and Dante told her the [[truth]] about the bet. He now doubts that she will show, but begs the two men to stall the audience until she comes, so they do. Lucy finally shows up, surprising Cecil, Dante, and Monte. After an awkward arrival, she puts on the straitjacket, has her legs cuffed, and is almost in the canvas bag when Monte interrupts, wanting a 'goodbye kiss'. Lucy, still angry at him, refuses, until she sees he has Mrs. Houdini's wedding ring between his [[Tooth|teeth]].

Lucy is locked in the bag, suspended upside down, and dropped into the water. She appears to be struggling to escape when several [[Gunshot|gun shots]] fire. It's Vivian, dressed in a red [[disguise]] but with the same black [[veil]] covering her face. She presses her 'self-defence bra' and the spikes once again stick out. She demands money and the audience give it to her whilst Monte stares in shock. Jeanette also gives her two bags of money from the register.

When Viv leaves, the attention turns back to Lucy. The canvas bag is still in the water. Monte- aware that if he tries to save her, he will lose the bet- jumps into the water, before finding out that the bag is devoid of Lucy. The audience is confused until they find her on the second level of the restaurant, dripping from the water but otherwise fine.

Later on, Monte is still somewhat damp but approaches Lucy nonetheless. She's less angry with him since he risked $4,000,000 to save her, but she shakes his hand and prepares to leave him for the last time. Monte calls her back and asks if she will go out with him the following day, but this time, it's for real. The two kiss before Lucy leaves. Outside, Viv is waiting by two new [[Bicycle|bikes]] from Cecil and Dante and the movie ends with the two girls riding down the dark street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11748">'''The University of Bristol Theatre Collection''' was founded in 1951 to serve the [[University of Bristol]] Department of Drama. It is now one of the world’s largest archives of [[Theatre of the United Kingdom|British Theatre History.]] It is a fully accredited Archive and Museum and home to the [[Live Art Archive]].

== History ==
The Theatre Collection was established in 1951 following a symposium led by [[Glynne Wickham]] which called for Universities to endorse the policy of studying drama in the context of theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/feb/25/guardianobituaries.highereducation|title=Obituary: Glynne Wickham|last=Br|first=George|last2=t|date=2004-02-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Wickham instigated the purchase of its first acquisitions and laid the foundations for the Theatre Collection with funds awarded to the University of Bristol by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;University of Bristol Theatre Collection: a Guide to Readers; University of Bristol Publication; c.1980&lt;/ref&gt;. From the outset it was designed to be a working collection of theatre history, to serve scholars and practising theatre artists alike. 

In 1969 the University made an award from its Appeal Fund to provide the Collection with adequate storage and access facilities within the Department of Drama.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first official keeper of the Theatre Collection was Anne Brooke Barnett (died 2009) who managed the holdings from 1966 to 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/theatrecollection/news/newsletters/22%20winter2009.pdf|title=Anne Brooke Barnett obituary|last=|first=|date=1 December 2009|website=University of Bristol Theatre Collection Newsletters 2009|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assistant Keeper from 1971 until Anne Brooke Barnett's retirement was Christopher Robinson (died 2003), who succeeded her and was Keeper until his own retirement in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Robinson - Obituary by Glynne Wickham (died 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; October 2003); University of Bristol publication; October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2010 the Theatre Collection received a funding allocation from [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)]] to support it being accessible to the wider Higher Education community. Benefactors have also supported the work of the Theatre Collection.

== Accreditation ==

In 2001 the University of Bristol Theatre Collection was awarded Registered museum status, followed in 2009 by full Accredited Museum status, by the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]], as recognised by the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council of England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/document/list-accredited-museums-uk-channel-islands-and-isle-man|title=Accredited museums in the UK, Channel Islands and Isle of Man {{!}} Arts Council England|website=www.artscouncil.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In July 2017 it became the first university museum to receive Archive Service Accreditation from [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2017/september/theatre-collection-accreditation.html|title=September: Theatre Collection accreditation {{!}} News {{!}} University of Bristol|last=Bristol|first=University of|website=www.bristol.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/archives-sector/archive-service-accreditation/accredited-archive-services/|title=Accredited archive services, statistics and outcomes - The National Archives|last=Archives|first=The National|work=Archives sector|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Their accreditation report concluded that: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Bristol University Theatre Collection has an exceptionally strong grasp of its broad network of stakeholders, and their needs. This enables them to deliver impressive outcomes across the board, with outstanding academic delivery and a real capacity to support wider social outcomes.
