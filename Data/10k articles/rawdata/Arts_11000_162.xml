'''''10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman''''' is a video created for [[Hollaback!]] by Rob Bliss Creative and featuring 24-year-old actress Shoshana Roberts, and released on October 27, 2014. The video shows Roberts walking through various neighborhoods of [[New York City]], wearing jeans and a black crewneck T-shirt, with a hidden camera recording her from the front. The two-minute video includes selected footage from ten hours, showcasing what has been described by some as "catcalls" and [[street harassment]] of Roberts by men, reporting there were 108 such instances. The behaviors included people saying "hello" or "good morning", comments on Roberts' appearance, attempts to initiate conversation, angry remarks, and men following her for several minutes.&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/28/walking-in-nyc-as-a-woman_n_6063054.html|title = Watch This Woman Receive 100 Catcalls While Walking Around For A Day|last = Sieczkowski|first = Cavan|date = October 28, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3543632/street-harassment-hollaback-video/|title = Watch This Woman Get Harassed 108 Times While Walking in New York City|last = Alter|first = Charlotte|date = October 28, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = ''[[Time Magazine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/28/living/hollaback-10-hours-walking-in-nyc/|title = What 10 hours of street harassment in NYC looks like|last = Grinberg|first = Emanuella|date = October 29, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = ''[[CNN]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Andrew|title=Now Trending: Woman harassed more than 100 times walking streets of New York|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/celebrity-news/the-a-list/now-trending-woman-harassed-more-than-100-times-walking-streets-of-new-york/article21368304/|accessdate=18 June 2015|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2018, the video has received over 45 million views on [[YouTube]].

==Production and goals==

Roberts said that she got involved with the video by responding to a [[Craigslist]] posting by Rob Bliss a few months prior, and that although Rob Bliss told her that this was potentially a viral video, she was skeptical but was open to giving it a try.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/10/29/the-story-behind-that-10-hours-of-walking-in-nyc-viral-street-harassment-video/|title = The story behind that ’10 hours of walking in NYC’ viral street harassment video|last = Butler|first = Bethonie|date = October 29, 2014|accessdate = April 14, 2015|publisher = ''[[Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/17/the-woman-in-10-hours-walking-in-nyc-i-got-people-wanting-to-slit-my-throat|title =  The woman in 10 Hours Walking in NYC: ‘I got people wanting to slit my throat’ The video exposing 10 hours of sexual harassment in New York in October has now had nearly 40m hits. But what was the impact on struggling actor Soshana Roberts?|last = Hoby|first = Hermione|date = December 17, 2014|accessdate = April 15, 2015|publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Bliss himself shot the video by walking a few feet in front of Roberts with a [[GoPro]] camera in his backpack.&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt; Bliss and Emily May (executive director and co-founder of [[Hollaback!]], for whom the video was made) clarified in comments to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that Roberts' dress choice (jeans and a T-shirt) was made so as to debunk the misconception that women only get harassed if they wear revealing clothing. Roberts also said that she experienced similar harassment every day on the streets of New York City as was shown in the video.&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

==Reception==
The video was hailed for providing visual proof of what many considered an important problem relating to the treatment of women in city streets.&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt;&lt;ref name=kottke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kottke.org/14/10/ten-hours-of-walking-in-nyc-as-a-woman|title = Ten hours of walking in NYC as a woman|last = Kottke|first = Jason|authorlink = Jason Kottke|date = October 29, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commentators disputed the implicit characterization of many incidents in the video, such as people casually greeting Roberts, as harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2014/1030/Catcall-video-reaction-Is-hello-in-the-street-sexual-harassment-video|title =  Catcall video reaction: Is 'hello' in the street sexual harassment?| publisher = ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' | date =  October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others responded that, even though the words themselves may not seem like harassment, the social context, including that they were directed only at Roberts rather than at male passersby, made them harassment.&lt;ref name=kottke/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alex-alvarez.tumblr.com/post/101234300328/relax-its-a-compliment|title = Relax, it's a compliment|last = Alvarez|first = Alex|date = October 28, 2014|accessdate  = April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism was that the video was racially biased because it depicted black men harassing Roberts, a white woman, even though the video creator said that she was catcalled by people of all races.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/10/29/catcalling_video_hollaback_s_look_at_street_harassment_in_nyc_edited_out.html|title = The Problem With That Catcalling Video|last = Rosin|first = Hanna|date = October 29, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = ''[[Slate Magazine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=storify&gt;{{cite web|url = https://storify.com/Aut_Omnia/why-you-shouldnt-share-the-nyc| title = Why you shouldn't share that NYC catcalling video.

Some critics combined both angles of criticism, claiming that the comments that Roberts considered street harassment were so perceived by her (and by her audience) because of race and class differences between her and the men making the comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertyviral.com/uppity-white-liberal-upset-about-being-catcalled-by-minorities-in-nyc/|title = Uppity, White Liberal Upset About Being Catcalled By Minorities In NYC|publisher = [[Liberty Viral]]|date = October 29, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others disputed the characterization of the video as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beautifulbitchmonsteridiot.com/2014/10/30/harassement-and-freedom-of-speech/|title = Harassment and freedom of speech|last = Chok|first = Vera|date = October 30, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|quote=This video and the point it’s drawing our attention to is not my idea of a liberal, racist, or neurotic video.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts, the woman featured in the video, reported receiving death threats within days of the video being released, and said that she no longer felt safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/01/360494480/woman-in-street-harassment-video-i-do-not-feel-safe-right-now|title = Woman In Street Harassment Video: 'I Do Not Feel Safe Right Now'|date = November 1, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/actress-who-highlighted-street-harassment-receives-rape-threats-online-9824803.html|title = Shoshana Roberts: Actress who highlighted street harassment receives rape threats online|date = October 29, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = ''[[The Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/10/29/7088867/catcall-video-hollaback-rape-threats|title = The woman who made a video about catcalling is already getting rape threats|last = McKinney|first = Kelsey|date = October 29, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = ''[[Vox Media|Vox.com]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/when-street-harassment-continues-online/?_r=0|title = When Street Harassment Continues Online|last = North|first = Anna|date = October 30, 2014|accessdate = April 14, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts later filed a lawsuit against the video's producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke |first=Kerry |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/actress-walking-nyc-woman-video-files-lawsuit-article-1.2292312 |title='Walking in NYC as a Woman' catcall video actress files suit |publisher=NY Daily News |date= |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lawsuit was dismissed before going to trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Roberts v.

In 2015, Roberts was named as one of ''[[The Forward]]'' 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=November 11, 2015 |url=http://forward.com/series/forward-50/2015/ |title=Forward 50 2015 – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2015-11-07 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A male model walked around [[New York City]] for three hours, recorded via hidden camera by Model Pranksters, was shown to have received over 30 catcalls, many of them qualitatively similar to what Roberts received. The video was taken as evidence that an attractive man in a body-flattering outfit could get harassed in much the same way that many women did, but commentators noted that whereas harassment was a reality for almost all women, only extremely good-looking men had to deal with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elitedaily.com/news/world/man-harassed-walking-nyc-streets/823677/|title = Man Gets Harassed Over 30 Times In 3 Hours Walking In NYC (Video)|last = Smith|first = Kevin|date = November 1, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = ''[[Elite Daily]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/11/01/video-of-a-man-getting-catcalled-in-new-york-stirs-up-harassment-debate-4930405/|title = Video of a man getting catcalled in New York stirs up harassment debate|last = Wheaton|first = Oliver|date = November 1, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=instinct&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instinctmagazine.com/post/hot-male-model-endures-sexual-harassment-streets-new-york|title = "Hot Male Model" Endures Sexual Harassment On The Streets Of New York|date = November 3, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2015|publisher = Instinct Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A video was shot in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], with a very similar setup to the original video, featuring model Nicola Simpson. The video reported no catcalling instances, and noted that she was stopped only twice, once by somebody asking for directions and another time by somebody who complimented her on her appearance but followed up by apologizing for stopping her. The video was cited as evidence that harassment is not an inevitable reality of life but rather dependent on the culture in a region, and that it was possible for big cities to have substantially lower levels of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mic.com/articles/103410/a-model-recreated-that-catcalling-video-in-new-zealand-and-the-difference-is-telling|title = A Model Recreated That Catcalling Video in New Zealand — And the Difference Is Telling|last = Clifton|first = Derrick|date = November 4, 2014|accessdate = April 14, 2015|publisher = [[Mic.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/11/05/new_zealand_model_recreates_viral_catcalling_video_does_not_get_catcalled_at_all/|title =  New Zealand model re-creates viral catcalling video, does not get catcalled at all.

* A woman walking around New York City, initially dressed in ordinary Western clothing (for five hours) and then in a [[hijab]] (for another five hours). Although she got harassed in a manner similar to Roberts in the first five hours, she didn't get harassed in the next five hours. The video was created by Karim Metwaly and the woman in the video was a friend of his. The implied message in favor of wearing the hijab was critiqued by commentators, who argued that such messages continued the tradition of [[blaming the victim]] and requiring women to be the ones to adjust their behavior while being judged by the [[male gaze]], a problem allegedly prevalent both in the West and in the Middle East and other Islamic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theislamicmonthly.com/the-trouble-with-street-harassment-videos-hijab-or-no-hijab/|title = The Trouble with Street Harassment videos, hijab or no hijab|last = Mastracci|first = David|date = November 7, 2014|accessdate = April 15, 2015|publisher = ''[[The Islamic Monthly]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/2014/11/10-hours-of-walking-in-hijab/|title = UK: 10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman in Hijab|publisher = [[Stop Street Harassment]]|date = November 20, 2014|last = Devos|first= Siel|accessdate = April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A woman, Pooja Singh, dressed in miniskirt and a [[tank top]] was filmed by [[IndieTube]] walking through the streets of [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. Although a few men looked at her covertly, nobody approached or harassed her.

'''Addis Video Art [[Festival]]''' is an annual international [[video art]] [[festival]] in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]].

Addis Video Art Festival intends to provide a platform for innovative video art in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The festival will screen throughout the city in a variety of locations including street corners, rooftops, public centers and art centers. By sharing video art in both conventional and non-conventional settings, the festival will reach both the artist community and the everyday passerby. The festival aims to create a dialogue between local, and international artists by promoting and encouraging [[digital media]] culture.

[[File:ShoeAM1928.JPG|thumb|''Shoe'', 1928. Metallinos' first work, a carving in local stone by the sculptor when he was 20.]]

'''Aristeidis Metallinos''' ({{lang-el|Αριστείδης Μεταλληνός}}; (1908 &amp;ndash; 19 May 1987) was a [[Greece|Greek]] sculptor.

There is no official record of Metallinos' birth date; he was one of three sons of Zacharias and Eleni Metallinos.

Except for one carving in stone of a woman's shoe  when he was 20, Metallinos spent the greatest part of his life working as a shoemaker, stonemason, builder and general craftsman in the village of [[Ano Korakiana]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digital-in.info/kor/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=1 Η Άνω Κορακιάνα σήμερα… Ano Korakiana today...]&lt;/ref&gt; on the island of [[Corfu]] in Greece. Despite early evidence of his imaginative talent as a carver of stone, Metallinos was prevented by poverty from artistic training. He did not begin his work as a self-taught sculptor until 1973, when at the age of 67 until his death in 1987, he fulfilled a long-held intention of using hammer and chisel 'to bear witness to human nature and its weaknesses' {{lang|el|«να παρουσιάσω τον άνθρωπο και τα ελαττώματά του»}}. The [[Eurasian scops owl|Scops owl]] Metallinos carved on a stone plaque fixed to the front of his house, displaying his initials, and holding a builder's trowel and a sculptor's hammer, is dated the year he made the transition from builder to sculptor, depicting in stone and marble a unique record of a fast changing pastoral economy, emphasising the primacy of the family, village institutions and traditional customs, yet mingling with this account of Greek folklore, works that are erotic, ribald and subversively political.

His work of over 250 pieces, nearly all completed in the last 12 years of his life, is kept together in a family museum in Ano Korakiana - a museum he built himself, intending it as a gift to the village.

Metallinos' first wife, Eleni, died childless. He was married again, late in life, to Angeliki, who bore him two children, Andreas and Maria. He died at the age of 79 on 19 May 1987. Andreas died in October 2016. His wife Anna continues to live in Ano Korakiana in the museum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greece.com/photos/destinations/Ionian_Islands/Corfu/Town/Ano_Korakiana/Ano_Korakiana:_Museum_-_Figurenschmuck/80409471 Το Μουσείου, The Μuseum - closed to the public - on ''Democracy Street'' in Ano Korakiana]&lt;/ref&gt; that houses a unique collection of work largely unknown outside the village in which it was created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19557">The '''art of Urartu''' refers to a historical and regional type of art from [[Urartu]] (Ararat), the ancient state of [[Western Asia]] which existed in the period from the 13th to the 6th centuries BC in the [[Armenian Highland]]. The art of Urartu was strongly influenced by nearby [[Assyria]], the most prominent state of that period in the region. It peaked around the 8th century BC but was mostly looted, scattered and destroyed with the fall of Urartu about a century later.&lt;ref name=c148&gt;Chahin, Mack, 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/619349/Urartu Urartu], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' online&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Urartian Art 04a~.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of a [[bronze]] throne of [[List of kings of Urartu|Urartian kings]]]]

== Overview ==
Urartian art was heavily influenced by neighboring Assyria, and despite the obvious stylistic differences was long considered a branch of Assyrian art. Urartian art is characterized by 1) a style following its [[Aesthetic canon|canon]] more rigorously than in other cultures of the Ancient East, 2) preference for [[Ornament (architecture)|ornaments]] rather than representational scenes of life, and 3) the practice of copying old examples instead of improving them.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"&gt;Пиотровский Б. Б. Искусство Урарту VIII—VI вв. до н. э. ("The Art of Urartu, 8th-6th century BC"). ([[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], Leningrad, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Afanaseva1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Афанасьева В. К., Дьяконов И. М. |title=Искусство Передней Азии 2 — середины 1 тысячелетия до н. э.. Памятники мирового искусства (The Art of Western Asia from 2nd to the middle of 1st millennium BC. Monuments of world art). Issue 2 (1st series). The Art of the Ancient Orient|publisher=Искусство|place=Moscow|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the style of Urartian craftsmen remained unchanged for several centuries and was gradually simplified.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; Urartian art was relatively poorly characterized until the 1950s, when major archeological work was started at the ancient Urartian cities [[Teishebaini]] and [[Erebuni Fortress|Erebuni]] and many Urartian [[cuneiform]] tables were deciphered.

==Bronze statuettes==
Although Urartian masters were capable of producing large bronze statue, not even fragments of any  have been found so far. Literature&lt;!--where?--&gt; mentions that Assyrians, while looting the city of [[Musasir]], removed a bronze statue of [[List of kings of Urartu|King]] [[Argishti I]] weighing 60 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] (about 1,8 tons). Small bronze objects of art were exclusively made for the king's palace and are divided into three groups: [[throne]] decorations, ornaments on copper [[cauldron]]s and, rarely, statuettes of Urartian gods.

===Throne decorations===
Between 1877 and 1885, local treasure hunters sold a few small bronze fragments to several European museums. These fragments later turned out to be parts of one and the same Urartian king's throne. They were cast in bronze into a mold and then gilded by wrapping in thin [[gold]] sheets. The fragments are currently preserved in the [[British Museum]], [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Louvre]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and in private collections in [[Paris]] and [[Brussels]].

===Boiler decorations===
{{double image|right|UrartianCaldron02.jpg|165|UrartianCaldron03~.jpg|290|Left: cauldron with bull heads found in [[Van, Turkey|Van]], Turkey. Right: cauldron from a [[Phrygia]]n city with figures assigned to the god [[Shivini]].&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ank&gt;[[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], [[Ankara]], Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cauldron decorations are the best-preserved objects of Urartian bronze and therefore were used in the early 20th century to identify the Urartian style in art.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; The decorated [[copper]] cauldrons were apparently used for ritual ceremonies. For example, the annals of the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] mention a bronze vessel filled with wine being part of the sacrifice to the god [[Ḫaldi]].

The bronze statuettes were cast separately and then attached to the cauldron. They include bull heads and winged deities, possibly the god [[Shivini]] and his wife [[Tushpuea]].&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; The technique of [[casting]] bronze ornaments spread from [[Urartu]] to the neighboring countries, in particular to [[Phrygia]], and then to Europe. Urartian cauldron ornaments have been found in [[Rhodes (city)|Rhodes]], [[Athens]], [[Boeotia]], [[Delphi]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and in [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tombs.&lt;ref name="Pallottino"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pallottino, M. |title=Urartu, Greece and Etruria|journal= East and West|volume=9|issue=1–2|place=Rome|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amandry"&gt;Amandry P.

===Statuettes of gods===

Only three bronze statuettes depicting Urartian deities have been preserved. One, possibly of the god [[Ḫaldi]], is stored in the British Museum, and two others are in the National Museum of the History of Armenia (copy in the Erebuni Museum, Yerevan, see image).

=== Helmets===
{{double image|right|Helmet08.jpg|130|Urartu_Helmet_Fragment_2~.jpg|250|Helmet of the Urartu king [[Sarduri II]] found at [[Karmir Blur]] near [[Teishebaini]].&lt;ref name=mus2&gt;National Museum of History of Armenia, Yerevan&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on the helmet reads: "Sarduri, son of [[Argishti I|Argishti]] dedicates this helmet to God Ḫaldi".&lt;ref name="PerevodP2"&gt;Пиотровский, Б.

Numerous Urartian helmets have been recovered, more than 20 alone during the excavations of [[Teishebaini]]. Royal ceremonial helmets did not differ in shape from simple combat helmets but contained engraved images.

===Shields===
A few decorative bronze Urartian shields have been found near Van (they are stored in the British Museum and Berlin museums) and 14 were excavated at [[Karmir Blur]]. They have diameters ranging between 70 and 100&amp;nbsp;cm and were not made for combat, as judged from the thinness of the metal and the character of the handles. All these shields contain concentric circles of lions and bulls which were designed so that no figure would appear upside down. The images were first stamped and then engraved with various instruments. The Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] described six golden Urartian shields, which were looted in [[Musasir]], weighing 6.5&amp;nbsp;kg each. They have not been recovered thus far.

Only three royal Urartian [[quiver]]s are known, all found during the excavations of [[Teishebaini]]. They are made of bronze and contain images of Urartian warriors.

{{clear}}
Poorly preserved remains of Urartian [[Mail (armour)|mail]] of [[Argishti I]] were excavated at [[Teishebaini]].&lt;ref name=mus/&gt; Entire (or parts of) wide bronze belts were found in Turkey (Altyn-Tepe), [[Iran]] ([[Lake Urmia]]) and Armenia (Karmir Blur). The belts were about 1 meter long and 12&amp;nbsp;cm wide and were designed to protect archers.

===Jewelry===
Jewelry of Urartu had two gradations: ornaments made of precious metals and stones for the king and his family, and their simplified bronze versions used by the rich. Many jewelry items were also used as amulets.&lt;ref name="Esayan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Есаян С.|title=Ювелирное искусство Урарту (Jewelry art of Urartu) |journal=Историко-филологический журнал|place=Yerevan|volume=3|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annals of the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] mention vast amounts of Urartian jewelry items made of silver and gold which were taken from Musasir in 714 BC.&lt;ref name=c148/&gt; They are not preserved and  some may have been melted by treasure hunters.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; The two largest recovered jewelry items are shown below. They are the pectoral decoration excavated at the late Urartian capital [[Rusahinili]] and the cover of the cauldron found at Teishebaini. Smaller items include golden pins, earrings, a [[bracelet]] and a few medallions. Jewelry was worn in Urartu by both men and women. Women's jewelry usually portrayed the Urartian goddess [[Arubani]], wife of Ḫaldi – the supreme god of Urartu. Also common are Mesopotamian motifs such as [[tree of life]] and [[winged sun]]. More accessible jewelry included bronze bracelets and earrings and [[carnelian]] beads.&lt;ref name="Esayan"/&gt;

=== Pottery and stone art ===
Contrary to expectations, very few stone reliefs and sculptures were found during excavations,&lt;ref name="Marr"&gt;Марр Н. Я., Орбели И. А. Археологическая экспедиция 1916 года в Ван (Archaeological Expedition in 1916 to Van), Petrograd, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; although the reliefs of the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] depicting the Urartian city of [[Musasir]] clearly show large statues.&lt;ref name=c148/&gt; Only a few minor remnants of stone reliefs were discovered in Turkey: the rest were likely destroyed after the fall of Urartu. However, pottery items were found in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Chahin, Mack, 160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wood and bone ===
A few art items made of bone were found, mostly broken to parts, such as the bone combs excavated near Teishebaini. The only preserved example of wooden art of Urartu is the horse which was attached to some larger wooden item.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt;

Many features of Urartian art were preserved in the neighboring countries after the fall of Urartu in the 6th century BC. Observations by [[Boris Piotrovsky]] suggest that decoration and production techniques of [[Scythians|Scythian]] belts and [[scabbard]]s were borrowed from Urartu.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; The Urartian way of decorating cauldrons spread over the ancient world, and it is believed that [[Art of Armenia|Armenian art]] and that of [[Georgia (country)|southern Georgia]] were partly based on the Urartian traditions.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1959"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Stepanyan"&gt;Степанян Н.

'''Cibola White Ware''' is a ceramic tradition of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], dating from 1225-1325 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Arleyn W. [http://archaeology.asu.edu/vm/southwest/salado/text.htm "Pottery and Pigments in Arizona: Salado Polychrome."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426021626/http://archaeology.asu.edu/vm/southwest/salado/text.htm |date=2012-04-26 }}  Department of Anthropology - Archaeological Research Institute Arizona State University (retrieved 4 Dec 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ware was produced roughly from the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]] south to the upper [[Gila River]] drainage, and from the [[White Mountains (Arizona)|White Mountains]] east to the [[Laguna Pueblo]] area (Goetze and Mills 1993:21)—and probably east into the Rio Grande drainage. Cibola White Ware shares its basic style (black designs painted on a white or light gray background) with a number of other regional wares, all produced by prehistoric [[Puebloan peoples]]. The various wares often shared stylistic ideas, and archaeologists make the various fine distinctions primarily to aid them in dating archaeological deposits and in tracing out prehistoric trade.

==Classification==
Most Cibola White Ware is distinguished from most other [[black-on-white]] wares by the use of crushed sherd temper in the preparation of clay for firing, along with the use of mineral-based black paint. If sherd temper is combined with black plant-based paint, the pottery is instead classified as Little Colorado White Ware (produced in the [[Little Colorado River]] drainage), with one exception, Chaco-McElmo Black-on-white. Also, some early Cibola White Ware vessels have mixed sand and sherd temper or all sand temper. The following table may help the reader understand where archaeologists have drawn the lines between one prehistoric ware and the next (see Goetze and Mills 1993:27–29 for further assistance).

==Medical claims==
{{Main|Medical claims in Scientology doctrine}}

''Clear Body, Clear Mind'' includes a disclaimer to the effect that the Purification Rundown is not a medical treatment and that it should not be read as making medical claims.&lt;ref name="desio" /&gt; However, in their Introduction to the book, David Root M.D. and James Barnes write: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;L. Ron Hubbard's Purification program remains the only proven and safe method for reducing or eliminating chemical residues from the body. It has been used to alleviate the symptoms and concerns of people exposed to radiation. With each year, the importance of this discovery to every man, woman and child on this planet becomes more evident.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hubbard claims to have been the discoverer of the "[[acid flashback]]" phenomenon, in which [[LSD]] is said to lodge itself in tissues and re-enter the bloodstream years later. He claims to have made this discovery "In the 1970s, working with cases of individuals who had been drug users". (pg. 23, 1990 hardcover edition)

Scientology's official website says of the book: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Pesticides, solar radiation, drug and environmental toxins have become increasingly pervasive in today’s society. They damage not just your health, but your personality and your ability to think clearly. ''Clear Body, Clear Mind -'The Effective Purification Program''', by L. Ron Hubbard, details his groundbreaking discoveries in this field. Discover the world’s only all-natural, proven program to eliminate drug and toxic residues lodged in the fatty tissues of your body. Over 250,000 have done this program with spectacular success." [https://web.archive.org/web/20080112082001/http://www.scientology.org/en_US/results/introservice/books/cbcm.html] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The claim of "Over 250,000" successes drew censure from the UK's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1425742/Scientologist-drug-claim-on-poster-is-censured.html|title=Scientologist drug claim on poster is censured|last=Petre|first=Jonathan|date=March 27, 2003|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was a count of everyone who had completed the program, including people whose "drug" exposure was infrequent use of alcoholic drinks or prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="grn_bates"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/mar/27/religion.anglicanism|title=Cult church censured on drug ads|last=Bates|first=Stephen|date=March 27, 2003|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 review of the book at a medical conference described the mega-doses of niacin as inappropriate, especially since they cause the release of [[histamine]], which is counterproductive when dealing with chemical sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt, T. (1995) "Sauna-Depuration: Toxicokinetics" presentation at 2nd Aspen Environmental Medicine Conference. Aspen, Colorado, September 7–9. cited in 
{{cite book|last=Staudenmayer|first=Herman|title=Environmental Illness: myth and reality|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|pages=48|isbn=978-1-56670-305-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related books==
In ''[[All About Radiation]]'', Hubbard (1957) sets out his idiosyncratic theories of [[radiation]], including the idea that large doses of vitamins could both alleviate and prevent [[radiation sickness]].&lt;ref name="atack142"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jon | last=Atack | year=1990| title = A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L.

''Purification: An Illustrated Answer To Drugs'' (New Era Publications, 1984. {{ISBN|87-7336-350-2}}) is an earlier, illustrated explanation of the Purification Rundown.&lt;ref name="refslund"/&gt; Another illustrated book, ''Narconon New Life Detoxification Program: the effective purification program by L. Ron Hubbard.'' (Bridge Publications, 1991. {{ISBN|0-88404-658-3}}) is listed as based on ''Clear Body, Clear Mind''.

'''''Demi Lovato: Stay Strong''''' is a 2012 documentary film about American singer [[Demi Lovato]] which follows her recovery after leaving rehab and her return to the music industry after abrubtly cancelling her tour with the [[Jonas Brothers]], putting her career on a hiatus in order to seek treatment. It premiered on March 6, 2012 on [[MTV]].&lt;ref name=Today /&gt; The documentary depicts her reflecting on her road to recovery, addressing several of her emotional and physical issues, celebrating [[Thanksgiving]] with her family in 2011 and returning for the very first time to the treatment facility she retreated to back in 2010.&lt;ref name=Video&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/746180/demi-lovato-stay-strong-how-things-got-out-of-control.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=December 25, 2015|date=March 7, 2012|title='Demi Lovato: Stay Strong' - How Things Got Out Of Control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later in her [[YouTube]] documentary about her life and career, ''Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated'' (2017), Lovato admitted to being dishonest about the outcome of her initial treatment in ''Demi Lovato: Stay Strong'', and also revealed that she was in fact under the influence of [[cocaine]] while being interviewed about her sobriety for the documentary film.&lt;ref name="Simply Complicated"&gt;{{cite web|title=Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated - Official Documentary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWTlL_w8cRA|website=''[[YouTube]]''|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SC Billboard"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Armstrong|first1=Megan|title=The 10 Most Honest Confessions From Demi Lovato's 'Simply Complicated' YouTube Documentary|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8005791/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-documentary-youtube-best-moments|accessdate=October 22, 2017|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SC Maxim"&gt;{{cite news|title=Demi Lovato Talks About Casual Sex and Cocaine Addiction in Her Revealing 'Simply Complicated'|url=https://www.maxim.com/women/demi-lovato-talks-cocaine-casual-sex-simply-complicated-2017-10|accessdate=October 22, 2017|work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]|date=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SC InStyle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Brandi|title=Demi Lovato’s Childhood Bullies Were So Intense They Petitioned for Her Suicide|url=http://www.instyle.com/news/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-documentary-interview|accessdate=October 22, 2017|publisher=[[InStyle]]|date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 28, 2011, Lovato completed inpatient treatment at Timberline Knolls and returned home. She acknowledged that she had suffered from [[anorexia]] and  [[bulimia]], had harmed herself, and had been "self-medicating" with drugs and alcohol "like a lot of teens do to numb their pain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Demi Lovato Exclusive Interview|url=http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/g2206/exclusive-interview-demi-lovato/|work=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lovato said that she "basically had a [[nervous breakdown]]" and was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] during her treatment.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Star Demi Lovato: I'm Bipolar|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/04/20/disney-star-demi-lovato-im-bipolar/|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]].

Lovato's third album, [[Unbroken (Demi Lovato album)|''Unbroken'']], was released on September 20, 2011 and was met with mixed to positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]].

On February 21, 2012, Lovato announced on [[Twitter]] that a television special she had worked on with [[MTV]] would premiere on March 6, 2012, while she also revealed its title ''#StayStrong'' and the promotional poster for the documentary, showing Lovato's "''Stay Strong''" wrist tattoos as well as her scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2300281/demi-lovato-tweet-stay-strong-special/|title=Demi Lovato Tweets About New Special, ‘Stay Strong,’ Airing March 6 On MTV|work=[[MTV News]]|last=Anitai|first=Tamar|accessdate=December 25, 2015|date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official trailer was released by MTV on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/734044/demi-lovato-stay-strong-trailer.jhtml|title='Demi Lovato: Stay Strong' Trailer|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=December 25, 2015|date=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Demi Lovato: Stay Strong'' commences with fans shouting Lovato's first name, while waiting for her to arrive at the [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]] in [[Detroit]] where she is about to perform on November 16, 2011.&lt;ref name=Video /&gt; The tour date marks the opening night of the [[A Special Night with Demi Lovato|Unbroken Tour]] and her first tour date since the sold-out ''An Evening with Demi Lovato'' two-date promotional tour that took place in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Demi Lovato NY, LA Shows Sell Out in Minutes|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/demi-lovato-ny-la-shows-228436|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=December 30, 2015|date=August 28, 2011|last=Schillaci|first=Sophie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovato starts reflecting on the rough road that led her to self-harm and addiction, while scenes of Lovato getting ready for her performance in the dressing room are interwoven featuring a short [[cameo appearance]] from her manager Phil McIntyre.&lt;ref name=Video /&gt; She says she "had so many issues underneath that needed to be taken care of and that "it literally ended up driving [her] insane". Shortly after, Lovato's home in [[Los Angeles]] is shown where she is seen hugging her mother Dianna Lee Hart, whereas Lovato's half-sister [[Madison De La Garza]] is also featured.&lt;ref name=Video /&gt;

As soon as Lovato's makeup and hair is done, she is ready to go on stage and a huge audience is seen cheering for her.&lt;ref name=Video /&gt; Lovato confesses, "I cannot tell you that I have not thrown up since treatment. I cannot tell you I’ve not cut myself since treatment. I’m not perfect.

The cameras follow her home where she spends her first Thanksgiving out of treatment and Lovato explains how her eating disorder had developed. "This year I am definitely not taking any holiday for granted," she says about spending Thanksgiving with her family.&lt;ref name=Thanksgiving&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/746202/demi-lovato-stay-strong-first-thanksgiving-out-of-treatment.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=December 26, 2015|date=March 7, 2012|title='Demi Lovato: Stay Strong' - First Thanksgiving Out Of Treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Thanksgiving, Lovato keeps thinking about what she ate on the holiday, cries about it and feels uncomfortable before going on stage.&lt;ref name=Beautiful /&gt; She feels sick, but still decides to perform. A small part of her performance of the song "Fix a Heart" is shown, as well as Lovato taking pictures with fans at her [[public relations|meet-and-greet]].&lt;ref name=Beautiful /&gt;

One of her fans, a [[cancer]] survivor, tells Lovato inspired her to go to the meet-and-greet without her wig.&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joshua-lyon/demi-lovato_b_1322659.html|title=Demi Lovato's Long Road to Recovery|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|last=Lyon|first=Joshua|accessdate=December 27, 2015|date=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beautiful /&gt; Sitting in front of the piano on stage, Lovato expresses how thankful she is to be there, "because not long ago I was in a treatment facility" and she "was so scared and was so alone but I had you guys [the fans] by my side". She mentions the "beautiful, beautiful girl that I met", tells the audience why the girl went to the concert without her wig and states, "That's why I continue to do this [performing] every single day of my life no matter how hard it gets."&lt;ref name=Beautiful /&gt; The singer adds, "It's the people sitting in this audience and the strength that you guys possess, so just keep inspiring people 'cause you're inspiring me to stay so strong til this day. So, thank you." and starts singing her song "Together" while letting the "special" girl join her on stage to perform a duet.&lt;ref name=Beautiful&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/746205/demi-lovato-stay-strong-one-beautiful-fan.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=December 26, 2015|date=March 7, 2012|title='Demi Lovato: Stay Strong' - One 'Beautiful' Fan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The singer revisits Timberline Knolls, the treatment facility in [[Lemont, Illinois|Lemont]], [[Illinois]] she entered back in 2010, for the very first time since she was released in mid-January 2011.&lt;ref name=Timberline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1680492/demi-lovato-stay-strong-rehab/|title=Demi Lovato Recalls Entering Rehab In ‘Stay Strong’|work=[[MTV News]]|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|accessdate=December 27, 2015|date=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovato recalls on her way to Timberline Knolls, "The first time that I walked into Timberline Knolls, I sat there to eat my first meal, and it was chicken, rice, vegetables and milk, and I took like two or three bites of the chicken and was like 'OK, I'm done'." adding, "That’s when I realized maybe I do belong here because I can’t finish a meal."&lt;ref name=Timberline /&gt; She confesses about the room she stayed in during her treatment, "I got so completely vulnerable and so raw, when I even step into this room I feel naked." Showing her wrist tattoos, she reveals how meaningful they are to her and she didn't get them just to cover up the scars she had, but also because her fans kept encouraging her to stay strong while in rehab.&lt;ref name=Timberline /&gt;

"I wish that every single person here could just live in freedom," Lovato tells the patients at Timberline Knolls while delivering a speech.&lt;ref name=Skyscraper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/746215/demi-lovato-stay-strong-demi-performs-skyscraper.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=December 27, 2015|date=March 7, 2012|title='Demi Lovato: Stay Strong' - Demi Performs 'Skyscraper'}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Timberline Knolls where she was first diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt; She admits that she didn't realise that she was ill before her treatment and used to assume that "writing seven songs in one night was normal". Bringing her guitarist and friend Mike Manning with her, Lovato gives an intimate acoustic performance of her empowering hit song "[[Skyscraper (song)|Skyscraper]]" after her speech and gets emotional, saying "Utilize your time here, 'cause this place will change your life, 'cause it changed mine."&lt;ref name=Skyscraper /&gt;

Lovato opens up about how she realized that she could use what she was for in the treatment center "for the better".&lt;ref name=Skyscraper /&gt; Instead of keeping her struggles and demons to herself, she decided to share her story with the world "because some people need to hear it". She wanted to inspire others with her story and prove that no matter what people are going through at the moment, they will get through it. The acoustic "Skyscraper" rendition at Timberline Knolls flows into a piano-driven performance of the song at a concert venue and Lovato is seen going into the crowd.&lt;ref name=Skyscraper /&gt; The singer and her crew dance to "[[B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)|B.M.F.]]" by [[Rick Ross]] in her tour bus after the concert while she acknowledges that "recovery doesn't have a day off".&lt;ref name=Road /&gt;

On the morning of March 6, 2012, Lovato made an appearance on [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''The Today Show'']] to promote the documentary which would premiere on MTV that night. She performed her single "[[Give Your Heart a Break]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/6209441/demi-lovato-performs-on-the-today-show|title=Demi Lovato Performs On ‘The Today Show’|last=Bain|first=Becky|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2016|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I've decided to tell my story because there are a lot of young teens, girls and boys, that are dealing with the same issues that I've been through. If I'm able to use my voice to do good in the world then I definitely want to do that," she told ''Today'' anchor [[Ann Curry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/06/demi-lovato-today-show-eating-disorder-stay-strong_n_1323631.html|title=Demi Lovato Previews New Eating Disorder Documentary On 'Today' Show (VIDEO)|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=January 3, 2016|date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the documentary film was premiered, Lovato immediately appeared on ''Demi Lovato: Stay Strong — The After Show'' in order to react to her documentary and do a special question-and-answer session. The show, hosted by MTV's [[Su-chin Pak|SuChin Pak]], was broadcast live from the [[One Astor Plaza|MTV Studios]] in [[Times Square]].&lt;ref name=AfterShow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1680608/demi-lovato-stay-strong-post-show/|title=Demi Lovato 'Stay Strong': Inside 'The After Show'|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=December 27, 2015|date=March 7, 2012|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans could participate in the conversation on Twitter by tweeting the hashtag ''#StayStrong'' and ask Lovato questions by using the hashtag #AskDemi. "It feels really awesome. Doing the documentary was so interesting," she shared when talking about how she felt after releasing the documentary.&lt;ref name=AfterShow/&gt; She added, "I felt really vulnerable, and I still kind of do tonight. I wouldn't change it. I'm doing awesome right now. I'm living a really healthy lifestyle. It's not easy. I struggle. But each day gets easier." Lovato announced during the post-show that she would have an upcoming appearance in ''[[Punk'd]]''.&lt;ref name=AfterShow/&gt;

The after show also featured some unaired extra footage.&lt;ref name=Bonus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2516153/demi-lovato-tattoos/|title=Demi Lovato Talks Tattoos In ‘Stay Strong’ Bonus Clip|last=Wilson|first=Gaby|work=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=January 20, 2016|date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the extra footage the singer explains every story behind her tattoos, including the reason why she got the signature heart from the [[Here We Go Again (Demi Lovato album)|''Here We Go Again'']] [[cover art]] tattooed on her wrist. She states that she sees it as a unique connection with her fans who "would draw it on their wrists every day" until she left treatment.&lt;ref name=Tattoo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/746752/demi-lovato-stay-strong-tattoos.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=December 27, 2015|date=March 7, 2012|title='Demi Lovato: Stay Strong' - Tattoos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several fans featured in cameos raise their voices praising Lovato for being an anti-bullying advocate. Lovato says that people can make a difference by speaking up when they experience or witness bullying and admits that she was bullied herself, but expresses that she does not care about what [[hatred|haters]] think about her.&lt;ref name=Cyber&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/746753/demi-lovato-stay-strong-cyber-bullying.jhtml|title='Demi Lovato: Stay Strong' - Cyber Bullying|work=[[MTV]]|accessdate=December 27, 2015|date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fatata te Miti''''' is an 1892 [[oil painting]] by [[France|French]] artist [[Paul Gauguin]], located in the [[National Gallery of Art]], in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/g/gauguin/04/tahiti23.html|title=By the Sea (Fatata te Miti)|publisher=Web Gallery of Art|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/paul_gauguin/index.html|title=Paul Gauguin New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Gauguin - "In the waves" or "Ondine" - 1889.jpg|thumb|''In the wave'' or ''Ondine'', 1889, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]
Gauguin painted ''Fatata te miti (By the Sea)'' in 1892 during his first trip to [[Tahiti]]. Like ''[[Vahine no te vi | Vahine no te vi (Woman of the Mango)]]'' (W 449) painted at the same time, it is an example of the relatively few straightforward genre scenes that Gauguin painted immediately after setting up his studio in a native bamboo hut at Mataiea, [[Papeari]].&lt;ref name= Stuckey/&gt; Nevertheless, as [[Nancy Mowll Mathews]], Gauguin's biographer,  points out, neither represents what he actually ''saw''; the paintings transforming the mundane and ordinary into an exoticized view of the island's life.&lt;ref name= Mathews&gt;Mathews pp. 171-2&lt;/ref&gt; A pendant painting ''[[Arearea no varua ino]] (The Amusement of the Evil Spirit)'' (W 514), executed shortly after Gauguin had returned to Paris, appears to share the same setting and demonstrates how he moved on from simple genre painting, introducing [[symbolism (arts) | symbolist]] elements. The same tree, dividing the painting into two distinct zones, can be seen in  ''[[Parau na te Varua ino]] (Words of the Devil)'' (W 458).&lt;ref name= Stuckey/&gt;

The painting depicts two Tahitian women, seen from behind, jumping into the sea. There is a [[fisherman]] in the background, fishing with a spear. The painting epitomizes the [[Romanticism |romantic]] view of Tahitians made famous by [[Pierre Loti | Pierre Loti's]] ''[[Le Mariage de Loti]]''. In that novel, Loti described his Tahitian bride's pursuits as extremely simple, "reverie, bathing, above all bathing".&lt;ref&gt;Stuckey  p.276 quoting Loti ch. VIII&lt;/ref&gt; The women in the painting bathe naked, removing their ''[[pareo]]s'', apparently unbothered by the presence of the fisherman nearby. This is an image of the uninhibited tropical paradise Gauguin had hoped to find, although the reality was that Polynesian culture had been transformed by western [[missionaries]] and [[colonialism]] as they imposed their own values and religion on the people living in the islands.&lt;ref name= Stuckey&gt;Stuckey pp. 276-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= NGA&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatata te Miti (By the Sea)|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg82/gg82-46624.html|website=nga.gov|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The theme of nymphs frolicking in the waves was a tradition of the [[Golden Age]] repeatedly represented by artists such as Titian and Courbet through to Gauguin's own contemporary Degas. Gauguin was fascinated by the theme, first taking it up in 1885 with his ''[[Women Bathing]]'' (W 167). He returned to it with his 1889 ''[[Ondine (Gauguin) | Ondine]]'' (W 336), his signature painting at the [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889 | Volpini Exhibition]].&lt;ref name = Stuckey/&gt;

Gauguin uses intense tropical colors to convey sensual delight.&lt;ref name = NGA/&gt; For example, he uses pinks and purples for the sand, although in reality the beaches were a drab volcanic brown.&lt;ref name= Mathews/&gt; The technique employed here of applying pure (unmixed) color in bold and flat shapes delineated by dark counters is one he developed in [[Pont-Aven School | Brittany]], dubbed ''[[cloisonnism]]''.&lt;ref name= Stuckey/&gt; Eisenman remarks that in this and similar paintings, Gauguin placed jigsaw puzzles shapes of complementary and adjacent shades side by side as binaries to suggest a coloristic liminal intermediary, reflecting Gauguin's spiritual belief that binaries such as the moral and physical universe were reconcilable.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; To heighten the luminosity and enhance their jewellike effect, Gauguin applied a thin layer of clear wax to the surface of his early Tahitian paintings.&lt;ref name= Stuckey/&gt;

The painting was previously owned by [[Chester Dale]], who left his collection to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/from_exhibitions/ig/chester_dale_collection/cdc_nga_2010-11_35.htm|title=From Impressionism to Modernism: The Chester Dale Collection|publisher=About Education|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Tahitian period==
Looking for a society more elemental and simple than that in France, Gauguin auctioned thirty of his paintings and used the money to travel to Tahiti. This first visit lasted from 1891 to 1893. His book ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Noa Noa|ca}}'' was written in the style of a travel journal and was originally meant to provide a context for his 1893 Paris exhibition. Gauguin first used the words "Noa Noa" reporting the words the Tahitians themselves used for the scent of Tahitian women: ''"Téiné merahi '''noa noa''' "''  meaning ''"(now) very '''fragrant'''"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Gauguin's Noa Noa|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/research/in-the-library/collection-in-focus/paul-gauguins-noa-noa|website=clevelandart.org|publisher=[[Cleveland Museum of Art]]|quote=A mingled perfume, half animal, half vegetable emanated from them; the perfume of their blood and of the gardenias—tiaré—which they wore in their hair.  "Téiné merahi noa noa (now very fragrant)," they said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substantive  ''Fenua'' ("land" or "island") is understood in the title of his book, so the correct translation is "The Fragrant Isle". Also implied is the Tahitian term for "Paradise" - ''Rohutu noanoa''.&lt;ref&gt;Danielsson (1965) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; In the event his book remained unpublished until 1901, although extracts were published in ''[[La Revue Blanche]]'' in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/research/in-the-library/collection-in-focus/paul-gauguins-noa-noa|title=Paul Gauguin's Noa Noa|publisher=www.clevelandart.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathews p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noa Noa|url=http://data.bnf.fr/12079829/paul_gauguin_noa_noa/|website=bnf.fr|publisher=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first European exhibition of Gauguin's work took place in March 1893 in Copenhagen, when he was able to take up the offer of a visiting sea captain and send out eight selected paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Danielsson p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; A film's genre will influence the use of [[filmmaking]] styles and techniques, such as the use of [[flashback (narrative)| flashback]]s and low-key lighting in film noir, tight framing in horror films, fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films, or the "scrawled" title-font and credits of ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'' (1995), a film about a serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; As well, genres have associated [[film scoring | film-scoring]] conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic [[melodrama]]s or electronic music for [[science-fiction film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic [[genre]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Butler]] and genre theory&lt;/ref&gt; include [[fiction]] and [[documentary]], from which subgenres have emerged, such as [[docufiction]] and [[docudrama]]. Other examples of subgenres include the courtroom- and trial-focused [[Drama (modern genre)|drama]] known as the [[legal drama]], which is a subtype of drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the [[The Evil Dead (franchise) | ''Evil Dead'']] films. Other popular combinations include the [[romantic comedy]] and the [[action comedy]] film. [[Alan Williams (disambiguation) | Alan Williams]] distinguishes three main genre categories: [[Narrative film | narrative]], [[Avant-garde film | avant-garde]] and documentary.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Genre film | Genre movies]] are "commercial feature films which, through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations".&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Genre affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in [[video rental store]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Films can also be classified by the setting, theme, topic, mood, format, target audience or budget. The setting is the environment where the story and action take place (e.g., a [[war film]], a [[Western film]], or a [[space opera|space-opera film]]). The theme or topic refers to the issues or concepts that the film revolves around (e.g., [[science-fiction film]], [[sports film]], or [[crime film]]). The mood is the emotional tone of the film (e.g., [[comedy film]], [[horror film]], or tearjerker film). Format refers to the way the film was shot (e.g., [[35&amp;nbsp;mm]], [[16&amp;nbsp;mm]] or [[8&amp;nbsp;mm film|8&amp;nbsp;mm]]) or the manner of presentation (e.g.: [[anamorphic widescreen]]). Additional ways of categorizing film genres may involve the target audience (e.g., [[children's film]], [[teen film]] or [[women's film]]) or by type of [[film production | production]] (e.g., [[B movie]], [[Blockbuster (entertainment) |big-budget blockbuster]] or [[low-budget film]]). ''Genre'' does not just refer to the type of film or its category; spectator expectations about a film, and institutional discourses that create generic structures also play a key role.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"&gt;
Hayward, Susan. "Genre/Sub-genre" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 185-192
&lt;/ref&gt;
Genres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama).&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;

==History==
The term "genre" was used to organize films according to type since the earliest days of cinema.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; By the 1950s, [[André Bazin]] was discussing the concept of "genre" by using the [[Western (genre)#Film|Western film]] as an example; during this era, there was a debate over [[auteur theory]] versus genre.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; In the late 1960s, the concept of genre became a significant part of [[film theory]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;

Film genres draw on genres from other forms; Western novels existed before the Western film, and [[musical theatre]] existed before film musicals were made.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived genre of a film can change over time; for example, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903) is seen in the 2010s as a key early Western film, but when it was released, it was seen as related to the "then-popular genres of the chase film, the railroad film and the crime film".&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; A key reason that the early Hollywood industrial system from the 1920s to the 1950s favoured genre films is that in "Hollywood's industrial mode of production, genre movies are dependable products" to market to audiences, they are easy to produce and it is easy for audiences to understand a genre film.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s to 1950s, genre films had clear conventions and iconography, such as the heavy coats worn by gangsters in films like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions in genre films enable filmmakers to create them in an industrial, assembly line fashion, an approach which can be seen in the [[James Bond]] spy films, which all use a formula of "lots of action, fancy gadgets, beautiful woman and colourful villains", even though the actors, directors and screenwriters changed.  &lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pure and hybrid genres==
Films are rarely purely from one genre, which is in keeping with the cinema's diverse and derivative origins, it being a blend of "vaudeville, music-hall, theatre, photography" and novels.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; American film historian [[Janet Staiger]] states that the genre of a film can be defined in four ways. The "idealist method" judges films by predetermined standards. The "empirical method" identifies the genre of a film by comparing it to a list of films already deemed to fall within a certain genre. The [[A priori knowledge|apriori]] method uses common generic elements which are identified in advance. The "social conventions" method of identifying the genre of a film is based on the accepted cultural consensus within society.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt; Martin Loop contends that [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films are not pure genres because most Hollywood movies blend the love-oriented plot of the romance genre with other genres.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCQOwvI9vsAC|title=Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology|last=Grant|first=Barry Keith|date=2007|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=9781904764793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Colins claims that since the 1980s, Hollywood films have been influenced by the trend towards "ironic hybridization", in which directors combine elements from different genres, as with the Western/science fiction mix in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]''.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt;

Many films cross into multiple genres. Susan Hayward states that spy films often cross genre boundaries with thriller films. &lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; Some genre films take genre elements from one genre and place them into the conventions of a second genre, such as with ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' (1953), which adds film noir and detective film elements into "The Girl Hunt" ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Barry Keith. ''Film Genre: From Iconography to Ideology.'' Wallflower Press, 2007. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s [[New Hollywood]] era, there was so much parodying of genres that it can be hard to assign genres to some films from this era, such as [[Mel Brooks]]' comedy-Western ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974) or the private eye parody ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973). &lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; Other films from this era bend genres so much that it is challenging to put them in a genre category, such as [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) and [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971).&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; 

[[Film theory|Film theorist]] [[Robert Stam]] challenged whether genres really exist, or whether they are merely made up by critics. Stam has questioned whether "genres [are] really 'out there' in the world or are they really the construction of analysts?". As well, he has asked whether there is a "... finite taxonomy of genres or are they in principle infinite?" and whether genres are "...timeless essences ephemeral, time-bound entities? Are genres culture-bound or trans-cultural?" Stam has also asked whether genre analysis should aim at being descriptive or prescriptive. While some genres are based on story content (the [[war film]]), other are borrowed from literature ([[Comedic genres|comedy]], [[melodrama]]) or from other media (the [[musical film|musical]]). Some are performer-based ([[Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers]] films) or budget-based ([[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]], [[low budget film]]), while others are based on artistic status (the [[art film]]), racial identity ([[Race films]]), location (the [[Western (genre)|Western]]), or sexual orientation ([[Queer cinema]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzRXmmpFgZEC|title=Film Theory: An Anthology|last=Stam|first=Robert|date=2000-02-21|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780631206545|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audience expectations ==
Many genres have built-in [[audience]]s and corresponding publications that support them, such as magazines and websites. For example, horror films have a well-established fanbase that reads horror magazines such as ''[[Fangoria]]''. Films that are difficult to categorize into a genre are often less successful. As such, film genres are also useful in the areas of marketing, [[film criticism]] and the analysis of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Hollywood story consultant [[John Truby]] states that "...you have to know how to transcend the forms [genres] so you can give the audience a sense of originality and surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.writersstore.com/whats-my-genre/|title=What's My Genre?|last=Truby|first=John|authorlink=John Truby|date=|website=Writers Store|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some [[screenwriter]]s use genre as a means of determining what kind of plot or content to put into a screenplay. They may study films of specific genres to find examples. This is a way that some screenwriters are able to copy elements of successful movies and pass them off in a new [[screenplay]]. It is likely that such screenplays fall short in originality. As Truby says, "Writers know enough to write a genre script but they haven’t twisted the story beats of that genre in such a way that it gives an original face to it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scriptmag.com/earticles/earticle.htm|title=Interview: John Truby on Screenwriting and Breaking In|last=Ward|first=Lewis|date=|work=Script Magazine|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2007-07-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702182835/http://www.scriptmag.com/earticles/earticle.htm|archivedate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinema technologies are associated with genres. Huge widescreens helped Western films to create an expansive setting of the open plains and desert. Science fiction and fantasy films are associated with special effects, notably computer generated imagery (e.g., the Harry Potter films).&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;

== Grouping vs. genre ==
There are other methods of dividing films into groups besides genre. For example, [[auteur]] critics group films according to their auteur-directors. Production attributes, such as the [[low-budget film]], can also be considered a grouping. Some groupings may be casually described as genres although the definition is questionable.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} For example, while [[independent film]]s are sometimes discussed as if they are a genre in-and-of themselves, independent productions can belong to any genre. Similarly, while [[art film]]s are referred to as a genre by film scholar [[David Bordwell]], who states that "art cinema itself is a [film] genre, with its own distinct conventions",&lt;ref name="Grant" /&gt; an art film can be in a number of genres (e.g., [[drama]], [[experimental film]], [[black comedy]], etc.).

==Categorization==
[[File:All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film) poster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[War film]] or [[Anti-war film|anti-war movie]]: [[Lewis Milestone]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', 1930]]
Because genres are easier to recognize than to define, academics agree they cannot be identified in a rigid way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUNBpwAACAAJ|title=Film Art: An Introduction|last=Thompson|first=Kristin|last2=Bordwell|first2=David|date=2012-07-06|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=|isbn=9780073535104|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, different countries and cultures define genres in different ways. A typical example are war movies. In US, they are mostly related to the two World Wars whereas, in other countries, movies related to wars in other historical periods are considered ''war movies''.

Film genres may appear to be readily categorizable from the setting of the film. Nevertheless, films with the same settings can be very different, due to the use of different themes or moods. For example, while both ''[[Midway (1976 film)|The Battle of Midway]]''  and ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]''  are set in a [[war]]time context and might be classified as belonging to the [[war film]] genre, the first examines the themes of honor, sacrifice, and valour, and the second is an [[anti-war film]] which emphasizes the pain and horror of war. While there is an argument that [[film noir]] movies could be deemed to be set in an urban setting, in cheap hotels and underworld bars, many classic noirs take place mainly in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC|title=Architecture and Film|last=Lamster|first=Mark|date=2000|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=9781568982076|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of filmsite.org argue that animation, [[pornographic film]], documentary film, [[silent film]] and so on are non-genre-based film categories.&lt;ref name="filmsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/genres2.html |title=Other Major Film Categories |publisher=filmsite.org|accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda Williams (film critic)|Linda Williams]] argues that horror, melodrama, and pornography all fall into the category of "body genres" since they are each designed to elicit physical reactions on the part of viewers. Horror is designed to elicit spine-chilling, white-knuckled, eye-bulging terror; melodramas are designed to make viewers cry after seeing the misfortunes of the onscreen characters; and pornography is designed to elicit sexual arousal.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} This approach can be extended: comedies make people laugh, tear-jerkers make people cry, feel-good films lift people's spirits and inspiration films provide hope for viewers.

A genre movie is a film that follows some or all of the conventions of a particular genre, whether or not it was intentional when the movie was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbKuuBqBWg8C|title=Journalists in Film: Heroes and Villains|last=McNair|first=Brian|date=2010|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748634477|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and history==
In order to understand the creation and context of each film genre, we must look at its popularity in the context of its place in history. For example, the 1970s [[Blaxploitation]] films have been called an attempt to "undermine the rise of Afro-American's Black consciousness movement" of that era.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt;  In William Park's analysis of film noir, he states that we must view and interpret film for its message with the context of history within our minds; he states that this is how film can truly be understood by its audience.&lt;ref name="What is Film Noir?"&gt; Park W. What Is Film Noir? [e-book]. Lanham, Md: Bucknell University Press; 2011. Available from: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost), Ipswich, MA. Accessed November 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Film genres such as [[film noir]] and [[Western film]] reflect values of the time period. While film noir combines German expressionist filming strategies with post World War II ideals; Western films focused on the ideal of the early 20th century. Films such as the [[Musical film|musical]] were created as a form of entertainment during the [[Great Depression]] allowing its viewers an escape during tough times. So when watching and analyzing film genres we must remember to remember its true intentions aside from its entertainment value.

Over time, a genre can change through stages: the classic genre era; the parody of the classics; the period where filmmakers deny that their films are part of a certain genre; and finally a critique of the entire genre.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; This pattern can be seen with the Western film. In the earliest, classic Westerns, there was a clear hero who protected society from lawless villains who lived in the wilderness and came into civilization to commit crimes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; However, in [[revisionist Western]]s of the 1970s, the protagonist becomes an [[anti-hero]] who lives in the wilderness to get away from a civilization that is depicted as corrupt, with the villains now integrated into society. Another example of a genre changing over time is the popularity of the [[neo-noir]] films in the early 2000s (''[[Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' (2001) and ''[[Far From Heaven]]'' (2002); are these film noir parodies, a repetition of noir genre tropes, or a re-examination of the noir genre?&lt;ref name="autogenerated185"/&gt; 

This is also important to remember when looking at films in the future. As viewers watch a film they are conscious of societal influence with the film itself. In order to understand it's true intentions, we must identify its intended audience and what narrative of our current society, as well as it comments to the past in relation with today's society. This enables viewers to understand the evolution of film genres as time and history morphs or views and ideals of the entertainment industry.

'''Gabrielle Nicole "Gabby" Logan''' (née '''Yorath'''; born 24 April 1973) is a British presenter and a former [[Welsh Gymnastics|Welsh international gymnast]] who is best known for her presenting roles with [[BBC Sport]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article5941115.ece |title=It's time for the English to play the hatred game with Scots |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2009 |first=Gabby |last=Logan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Logan was born in [[Leeds]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] to former [[Wales national football team|Welsh international footballer]] and manager [[Terry Yorath]] and his wife Christine when Yorath was playing for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Gabby Logan: Why Leeds will always have a special place in my heart |url=http://www.yorkshirelife.co.uk/people/celebrity-interviews/gabby_logan_why_leeds_will_always_hold_a_special_place_in_my_heart_1_1571450 |magazine=Yorkshire Life |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her father's career, Logan had to move around much in her youth, as her father played for a number of British teams as well as the Canadian team [[Vancouver Whitecaps (NASL)|Vancouver Whitecaps]].&lt;ref name=Raphael&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,708320,00.html |title=Angelic Host |first=Amy |last=Raphael |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |date=5 May 2002 |accessdate=27 December 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Bishop Ullathorne RC School]] in [[Coventry]], [[Cardinal Heenan Roman Catholic High School|Cardinal Heenan High School]] and [[Notre Dame Sixth Form College]] in Leeds and read Law at the [[College of St Hild and St Bede]], [[Durham University]].

Logan played [[netball]] at school and at university and also competed at [[high jump]], but the peak of her sporting career was when she placed 11th in [[rhythmic gymnastics]] representing Wales at the [[1990 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/recorddoctor/story/0,,1395887,00.html |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |title=The Record Doctor: Gabby Logan |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had to retire from gymnastics aged 17 due to [[sciatica]].

Logan became interested in football during her regular attendances at her father's matches, to which her mother went out of a "sense of duty".&lt;ref name=Raphael/&gt; On 11 May 1985, she was in the crowd at [[Valley Parade]] when the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] happened. She, along with her brother and sister, had left the stand only moments before the fire took hold and watched the disaster taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article1131387.ece |title= Day that will live with me forever |website=[[The Times Online]] |date=12 May 2003 |accessdate=29 April 2009 |location=London |first=Gabby |last=Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan's debut TV appearance was when she was chosen as the Leeds Rose for the 1991 [[Rose of Tralee (festival)|Rose of Tralee]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leeds Rose Gabby Logan Wants To Be A TV Presenter 1991 |url=http://www.rte.ie/archives/2016/0811/808549-gabby-logan-leeds-rose/ |website=[[RTE]] |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;{{Dead Link|date=August 2017}}{{cite web |url=http://www.thegatheringireland.com/Latest-Stories/Blog/March-2013/13-fun-facts-about-the-Rose-of-Tralee |title=13 fun facts about the Rose of Tralee |website=The Gathering |date=3 February 2013 |accessdate=5 August 2013|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130805110129/http://www.thegatheringireland.com/Latest-Stories/Blog/March-2013/13-fun-facts-about-the-Rose-of-Tralee |archivedate=5 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Logan was in the running to replace [[Des Lynam]] to front [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s football highlights show ''[[The Premiership (TV series)|The Premiership]]'', fellow sports presenter [[Jimmy Hill]] stated, "'I've known Gabby for many years and am pleased to see how well she is doing.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Logan's 15-year-old brother Daniel collapsed and died from [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]].&lt;ref name=Michelle/&gt; Logan has actively appealed for the Daniel Yorath Appeal, which raises funds for the treatment and detection of the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Ice-to-see-you-Gabby.1696287.jp |title=Ice to see you Gabby |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |date=15 August 2006 |accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her brother Jordan Yorath (born 1986) played football for England Universities in 2008 while in the final year of his planning and development surveying degree at Northumbria University. Jordan was previously at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] as a young professional and is currently registered to [[Wakefield F.C.]]. Logan's sister, Louise (born 1974), is a performer in the [[Cirque Du Soleil]]'s [[Zumanity]], the resident cabaret-style show at the [[New York-New York Hotel &amp; Casino]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/zumanity/show/fauna/straps.aspx |title=Cirque du Soleil STRAPS – Artist: Louise Yorath |website=Cirquedusoleil.com |date= |accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan married former [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] international rugby union player [[Kenny Logan]] on 19 July 2001.

His current endeavor is creating spiritually uplifting [[piano]] arrangements of popular [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hymns|LDS Hymns]].  He resides in [[Oceanside, California]] and is a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865601511/Whats-New-Sacred-Hymns-is-a-moving-CD.html?pg=all Deseret News 22-April-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormonmomswhoblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/beautiful-new-cd-hymns-by-garth-smith.html Mormon Moms Who Blog 04 Apr 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Life and education ==
Garth was born in [[Brigham City, Utah]], the son of a senior executive chemical engineer working at [[Thiokol]], G. Ray and JoAnne (Petty) Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865634109/Whats-new-How-Beautiful-Thy-Temples-brings-a-spirit-of-peace.html?pg=all Deseret News 8 Aug 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; After taking a short break to serve a mission to the [[Navajo]] people of [[Northern Arizona]], Garth completed a college degree in Design Engineering Technology from [[Brigham Young University]], graduating in the class of 1988.  Afterwards, Garth accepted a position at [[Intergraph Corporation]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Later he moved to [[Carlsbad, California]] to accept a design position with [[Callaway Golf]].

== Music career ==

Garth began his classical musical training on the piano at the age of 5.  As a missionary and college student he would entertain many with his piano skills, including a special performance of [[Piano sonatas (Beethoven)|a Beethoven sonata]] to over 15,000 people in the BYU Marriott Center at his college graduation.

He has been a member of the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) and the [[Nashville Songwriters Association International]]. In 1999 he was the recipient of the California Country Music Association (CCMA) "Song of the Year" award for the song "Last Call." He has also performed as a keyboardist in jazz, rock, and country bands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mormonmusic.org/mormon-artists/garth-w-smith/ MormonMusic Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nashville Era ===
While living in Alabama, Garth was introduced "Writers in the Round" at the famous [[Bluebird Cafe]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], a club famous for intimate, acoustic music performed by its composers.  Soon, Garth was active participant there, performing his own original compositions.

Garth also participated as both a rehearsal and performance pianist in the local community theaters of Huntsville.  He also joined in various local bands touring throughout Northern Alabama and Southern Tennessee.  They also participated in local music festivals including Huntsville's annual [[Panoply Arts Festival]].

=== California Era ===
Relocating to [[Southern California]] in 1996, Garth continued playing in country bands, as well as developing his songwriting abilities. His bands have played at many popular venues such as the [[Viejas Casino]] and the [[San Diego County Fair]].

== LDS Hymns ==
By 2014, Garth had turned his music to creating artistic arrangements of popular [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|gospel hymns]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]], producing several albums, music videos and other related works.  His work is available through [[Deseret Book Company|Deseret Books]].
 
=== Album #1: Sacred Hymns ===
Recently Garth has turned his attention to recording original arrangements of popular LDS Hymns, releasing this first album in 2014 titled ''Sacred Hymns Arranged and Performed on the Piano''.  This has received great acclaim and wide national distribution within the LDS music genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldsmag.com/article-1-14272/ Meridian Magazine 27 April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Album #2: Temples ===
For his second full-length album, ''How Beautiful Thy Temples, Sacred Hymns, Vol. II'' (released in 2015), Garth brings his masterful, reverent signature style to bear on hymns and sacred songs that focus on the beauty and eternal significance of temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldssmile.com/2015/05/07/review-of-how-beautiful-thy-temples-sacred-hymns-vol-ii-by-garth-smith/ LDS SMILE 07 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; This has been his most successful release yet, having charted nationally at #21 on the iTunes Gospel new music chart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldsmissionaries.com/sacred-hymns-for-missionaries-inspiring-piano-music-by-garth-smith/ Sacred Hymns for LDS Missionaries 27 Aug 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Crawford Gates]], famous LDS composer, has called "How Beautiful Thy Temples" a "fabulous recording." Smith's arrangement of Gates' beloved Easter hymn "He is Not Here" (from "The Choirbook") is included as track 8 on the album.

From "An Angel From on High," an arrangement inspired by the statue of the Angel Moroni that sits atop many temples, to the children's songbook classic "I Love To See the Temple". It's the perfect music to set the tone around your home on the Sabbath or to invite the Spirit more fully into your life day-to-day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldsmissionaries.com/sacred-hymns-for-missionaries-inspiring-piano-music-by-garth-smith/ Sacred Hymns for LDS Missionaries 27 Aug 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Album #3: Great Redeemer ===
On 01-Sept-2016, Garth released his third album of [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|LDS Hymn arrangements]], a collection of fresh, new arrangements of about the Saviour, [[Jesus Christ]], titled ''Behold the Great Redeemer, Sacred Hymns, Vol. III.''  A new addition is the release of his original sheet music so that now other experienced pianists can perform this genre music in church worship services and other religious settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldsliving.com/LDS-Pianist-Garth-Smith-Releases-Christ-Centered-Album/s/83007 LDSLiving.com Behold the Great Redeemer]&lt;/ref&gt;   Selections include ''[[Lead, Kindly Light]],'' ''In Humility our Saviour,'' and another [[Crawford Gates]] masterpiece, ''Our Saviour's Love''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The bottom line is this—Smith’s music takes you to a place of serenity, an escape from the world for a moment, and provides the listener with beautiful arrangements that point to the Savior."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Album #4: A Sacred Christmas ===
Released in time for the 2017 [[Christmas| Christmas season]], ''A Sacred Christmas'', this album features a variety of his favorite hymns that commemorate the birth of the Saviour.  This album features several guest artists, Calee Reed, Michael Dowdle, [[One Voice Children's Choir]], Sun Valley Carolers and others that add an extra layer of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mormonmusic.org/mormon-artists/garth-w-smith Mormon Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music Firesides ===
He frequently travels the country performing free, inspirational [[Fireside (LDS Church)|music firesides]].  His 60 minute presentation explores gospel principles found in 8 hymns that includes [[Restorationism|the restoration]], [[prayer]], [[sacrament]], [[forgiveness]], and most importantly, the [[atonement]] of Jesus Christ.

The multimedia presentation features a Christ-centered narrative, live piano, video clips from prophets and apostles, and artwork from other LDS artists.

=== Gospel Music Videos ===
Garth's piano is a backdrop featured in many gospel music videos produced directly by or for the LDS Church, including the church's recent [[#LIGHTtheWORLD]] Christmas season service message. The most popular of these videos is the [[Heaven's Hallelujah]] arrangement featuring vocalist [[Lauren Sullivan]]. Many of these are accessible for free on their [[YouTube Channel]].

'''''Hydro Sapiens''''' is an art performance performed by The Lunatics from The [[Netherlands]]. It premiered in [[Singapore]] at [[Bedok Reservoir]] on  20 June 2008. It was the official closing performance for the [[Singapore Arts Festival]] and was a collaboration with the Singapore International Water Week.

The forty-five minutes play explores the power of water through comedy and drama. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For every question, there is an answer… What is the power of water? How weak can it make you? Should we fear it, love it, hate it? A human being is made up 66% percent out of water, so why do we need more? And in how many ways a man can drown? For all these questions, The Lunatics will try to find the answers - through a very intensive, hilarious, spectacular and even brutal search for the right value of water....&lt;ref name="aboutsingapore_hydrosapiens"&gt;[http://www.siww.com.sg/aboutsingapore/hydrosapiens.php Singapore International Water Week - Powered by GlobalSign.In&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


It featured various special effects like pyrotechnics and impressive machinations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Twelve fanatic and truly wet actors, thousand of litres of water, 45 minutes of splashing experiences, countless moments of awe, laughter and silence, and water in your eyes. In 2008 The Lunatics would like to present to you their newest adventure: Hydro Sapiens!&lt;ref name="aboutsingapore_hydrosapiens" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For its premiere, it was open to the public for free. An estimated 5000 people attended the performance

'''iO''', or '''iO Chicago''', (formerly known as "ImprovOlympic") is an improv theater and training center in central [[Chicago]], with a former branch in [[Los Angeles]] called [[iO West]]. The theater teaches and hosts performances of [[improvisational comedy]]. It was founded in 1981 by [[Del Close]] and [[Charna Halpern]]. The theater has many notable alumni, including [[Amy Poehler]] and [[Stephen Colbert]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-io-theater-new-home-20140801-column.html|title=Inside the new iO,where Fey, Poehler got their start|first=Chicago|last=Tribune|website=Chicagotribune.com|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
iO concentrates on "long-form" improvisational structures, in contrast to the "short-form" or "improv game" format of [[Theatresports]], [[ComedySportz]] or the television show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (disambiguation)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' The iO's signature piece is the "[[Harold (improvisation)|Harold]]", and the theater features other forms of improvisation, as well as sketch comedy and stand-up comedy.{{citation needed|reason=No citation|date=June 2016}}

The building has four performance spaces:
* The Del Close Theater - This is the second-largest of iO's theaters, and is located on the ground floor of the building. It hosts some of iO's premiere shows, such as ''The Armando Diaz Theatrical Experience and Hootenanny'', ''Whirled News Tonight'', ''The Improvised Shakespeare Company'', and ''The Deltones''.
* The Chris Farley Cabaret - One of two cabaret-style theaters in the building, this hosts many different types of performances, mostly improvised and mostly non-Harold.
* The Jason Chin Harold Cabaret - Named after a revered teacher at iO who died on January 8, 2015, this theater predominantly features performances of the Harold from house teams at the theater which specialize in that form.
* The Mission Theater - This is adjacent to the main iO complex, but is separately run and managed by [[T. J. Jagodowski]] and [[David Pasquesi]], or "TJ and Dave".{{cn|date=October 2018}}

iO has one other active franchise: [[I.O. West|iO West]], located in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

==History==

The ImprovOlympic was created in 1981, putting competing teams of comedic improvisers on stage in front of audiences. This was the brainchild of [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], who used early [[Viola Spolin]] theater games as a way for teams to compete. The first ImprovOlympic classes and shows took place at [[The Players Workshop]] in [[Chicago]], where [[Charna Halpern]] was an improv student. Charna Halpern became David Shepherd's assistant, and eventually the producer of the competitions. There were also competitions at a network of local bars and clubs. In 1982, The ImprovOlympic moved from [[The Players Workshop]] to its own space. Teams began to form out of every major [[improv troupe]] in Chicago. Shows began shifting to a long-form approach by 1983. 

In 1995, The ImprovOlympic moved to its location on Clark St. in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.ioimprov.com/about/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410182406/http://chicago.ioimprov.com/about/about |archivedate=April 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional theater, iO West was opened by Paul Vaillancourt in Los Angeles, California in 1997. Today it is managed by Colleen Doyle and Zach Huddleston. In 2001, The [[International Olympic Committee]] legally threatened the theater over its use of the name "ImprovOlympic" and the name was subsequently changed to "iO." On September 2, 2005, iO held its 25th anniversary show at the [[Chicago Theater]] in downtown Chicago.  The wireless microphones went dead shortly into the show, but the improvisers rallied and played using wired mics for the rest of the performance. Celebrity veterans of the iO program who returned to play included Mike Myers, Tim Meadows, Amy Poehler, and Ike Barinholtz. The opening to the Harold piece performed was conducted by the most veteran iO house team "The Reckoning." 

In August 2014, after almost 20 years in Chicago's Wrigleyville neighborhood, Charna Halpern bought a building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and moved the iO Theater to its new home at 1501 N. Kingsbury St.

The '''International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property''' ('''ICCROM''') is an [[Intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental organization]] dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage worldwide through training, information, research, cooperation and advocacy programmes. It aims to enhance the field of [[conservation-restoration]] and raise awareness to the importance and fragility of cultural heritage.

The creation of the Centre took place as a result of a proposal at the [[UNESCO]] General Conference held in [[New Delhi]], in 1956. Three years later, the Centre was established in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], where its headquarters remain to this day.

ICCROM responds to the needs of its [[Member States]], which are currently at 136.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{Cite web

==Mission==
ICCROM’s mission is defined by a set of statutes that were drafted shortly before its establishment (and revised on 25 November 2009).&lt;ref name="ICCROM Statutes"&gt;{{Cite web
| title = ICCROM Statutes
| url = https://www.iccrom.org/sites/default/files/2017-01/Statutes_2009_EN%26FR.pdf

{{quote|Article 1, Purpose and functions

The 'International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property', hereinafter called 'ICCROM', shall contribute to the worldwide conservation and restoration of cultural property by initiating, developing, promoting and facilitating conditions for such conservation and restoration. ICCROM shall exercise, in particular, the following functions:

# collect, study and circulate information concerned with scientific, technical and ethical issues relating to the conservation and restoration of cultural property;
# coordinate, stimulate or institute research in this domain by means, in particular, of assignments entrusted to bodies or experts, international meetings, publications and the exchange of specialists;
# give advice and make recommendations on general or specific questions relating to the conservation and restoration of cultural property;
# promote, develop and provide training relating to the conservation and restoration of cultural property and raise the standards and practice of conservation and restoration work;
# encourage initiatives that create a better understanding of the conservation and restoration of cultural property. }}

===Activities===
ICCROM's mission is fulfilled through five areas of activity: training, information, research, cooperation and advocacy.

====Training====
ICCROM contributes to capacity building through the development of educational materials, training activities worldwide, internships and fellows. Since 1965, ICCROM has offered courses to mid-career professionals on a wide range of topics that include archaeological site conservation, architectural records and inventories, built heritage conservation, conservation decision making, cultural heritage management, preventive conservation in museums and risk management to endangered collections. Other courses are focused on specific materials such as stone, wood, or sound and image collections, and others still focus on the conservation of heritage in specific regional areas, such as the Arab region or Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"&gt;ICCROM Information (brochure, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Information====
The ICCROM library is one of the world’s leading sources of information on the conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. It contains more than 115,000 registered references and 1,800 specialized journals in more than 60 languages. In addition, the archive contains institutional records that date back to ICCROM’s creation, as well as over 200,000 images of cultural heritage worldwide in relation to ICCROM’s scientific and educational activities. The website is a portal to comprehensive information about courses, activities, international events, and employment and training opportunities in the conservation field.&lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"/&gt;

====Research====
ICCROM facilitates a vast network of conservation professionals and institutions through which it organizes and coordinates meetings to devise common approaches and methodologies. It also promotes the definition of internationally agreed ethics, criteria and technical standards for conservation practice. The in-house laboratory is also a reference point and resource for professionals, course participants, interns and fellows of the organization.&lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"/&gt;

====Cooperation====
ICCROM carries out all of its activities in collaboration with a vast number of institutional and professional partners. Additionally, it serves its Member States in the form of collaborative projects, training, and technical advice. &lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"/&gt;

====Advocacy====
ICCROM disseminates teaching materials and organizes workshops and conferences to raise public awareness and support for conservation.&lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"/&gt;

==History==
The end of the Second World War came with the need to repair monuments and other forms of cultural heritage that had been either damaged or destroyed. At the same time, other countries were emerging from colonization and were eager to industrialize, reclaim and redefine their cultural identity, and train personnel to preserve their heritage.

On an international level, there was a lack of cohesive training and authoritative bodies to guide countries in rebuilding and protecting their heritage. Thus, during the Sixth Session of the UNESCO General Conference (1951), the Swiss government introduced a resolution that proposed the establishment of an international centre to encourage the study and awareness of methods of conservation on a global scale. This was adopted and a committee of experts were put together to decide upon the role and functions of this institution. In the Centre’s ten-year anniversary commemorative booklet ("The First Decade 1959-1969", pp. 12-13), Hiroshi Daifuku of the Section for the Development of the Cultural Heritage (UNESCO) explained,&lt;ref name="Daifuku"&gt;{{Citation

  | url = http://www.iccrom.org/ifrcdn/pdf/ICCROMhistory_10years_en.pdf
  | accessdate = &lt;!-----9 February 2010-----&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Mr. [[Georges Henri Rivière]] (then Director of [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]]) was appointed chairman of a sub-committee of the International Committee for Monuments of UNESCO for the creation of the Centre. The members of this Committee, when discussing the proposed functions of the Centre (September 25, 1953), considered that such a body could, for example:
:# treat major problems involved in conservation, such as lighting;
:# call upon a wide range of specialists from different countries;
:# provide information to countries which lack laboratories;
:# treat problems concerned with the preservation of monuments;
:# coordinate research and having a stronger [[moral authority]] eventually prevent badly trained conservators from undertaking restoration of important works of art.|}}

These functions would become the template for the Centre’s statutes.

In 1956 the resolution was adopted at the Ninth Session of the UNESCO General Conference in New Delhi and in 1957, an agreement was signed between the Government of the Italian Republic and UNESCO to establish this Centre in Rome.&lt;ref name="Daifuku"&gt;{{Citation

  | url = http://www.iccrom.org/ifrcdn/pdf/ICCROMhistory_10years_en.pdf
  | accessdate = &lt;!-----9 February 2010-----&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adhesion of five Member States by 1958 allowed the Statutes to come into force, making the Centre a legal entity. Collaboration was established with other European conservation institutions, namely the Central Institute of Restoration of Italy (ICR, now ISCR) and the Royal Institute for Restoration of Works of Art (IRPA) in Belgium. A provisional council nominated by UNESCO was created to govern the Centre and in 1959, it opened in Rome with [[Harold Plenderleith|Harold J. Plenderleith]], renowned Keeper at the [[British Museum]], as its Director. The Belgian art historian, Paul Philippot was appointed Deputy Director and the first General Assembly took place in 1960 during which the first regular Council Members were elected.

The '''International Child Art Foundation''' is a nonprofit organization founded in 1997. Head office is in Washington, D.C. They enhance academic performance and instill global citizenship by nurturing children's creativity and developing their empathy, which are key attributes of 21st century learners and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaf.org/about/ |title=About Us |website=International Child Art Foundation |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Children's Festival they host on every 4 years and is the world's largest international children's celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dc.about.com/od/specialevents/a/WorldChildFest.htm World Childrens Festival in Washington, DC]. About.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Inspired by [[E. Paul Torrance]]'s longitudinal and cross-cultural studies of the "4th Grade Slump", Dr. Ashfaq Ishaq created the ICAF to help children overcome this slump. The ICAF became the first national arts organization for American children and the first international arts organization for the world's children.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Ask the Expert: Q&amp;A with Ashfaq M. Ishaq]]". ''CyberTherapy &amp; Rehabilitation''. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999 the ICAF has produced the [[Arts Olympiad#World Children's Festival|World Children's Festival]] every four years on The National Mall in Washington, D.C. to honor the Arts Olympiad winners at an event of children's co-learning and co-creation.&lt;ref name=impacts&gt;[http://www.icaf.org/impact/ "Impacts"]. International Child Art Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts Olympiad==
{{Main|Arts Olympiad}}
The ICAF's flagship program is the '''Arts Olympiad.''' This art and sport program for children ages 8 to 12 is the most prestigious and largest in the world. The Arts Olympiad winners represent their cities at the '''World Children's Festival''' at the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;"[[The 5th Arts Olympiad]]". ''The Visual Art Beat.'' Salzburg, Austria April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline for the 5th Arts Olympiad is May 15, 2014.  The next World Children's Festival will be held in June 2015.

==Peace Through Art Programs==
The '''Peace Through Art Programs '''tap into the creativity of children so they can visualize with the importance of peace and co-existence. Their goal is to reduce the transmission of trauma and hatred from the current generation to the future one. The program develops empathy through art and imparts leadership skills so children can co-create a peaceful future for their communities. The program also aims to repair trust in humanity of children living in conflict zones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaf.org/pdfs/Lancet-Dec2006-Ishaq%20-%20Childrens-Creativity-to-Foster-Peace.pdf "Development of Children's Creativity to Foster Peace"]. ''The Lancelet.'' Vol. 368, December 2006

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healing Arts Programs==
The '''Healing Arts Programs''' was started in response to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Asian tsunami of December 2004]]. The organization wanted to transfer the knowledge and experience gained from the treatment of the child survivors of the 9/11 attacks to help the tsunami child survivors. The''' Tsunami Healing Arts Program''' was extended to the [[U.S. Gulf Coast]] as '''Katrina Healing Arts Program''' after [[Hurricane Katrina|Hur]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r[[hurricane Katrina|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[Hurricane Katrina|icane Katrina.]]The ICAF partnered with the [[World Bank]] Arts Program in 2005 on its "Destruction, Reconstruction and Prevention" program to broaden the understanding of natural disasters in the international development community.&lt;ref&gt;Hardman, Shirley.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
&lt;ref name=impacts/&gt;
* Approximately 5 million children in 80 countries have produced art under the ICAF programs.
* The ICAF has the distinction of having hosted the first national children's art festival in U.S. history, which took place in Washington D.C. in September 1998.

[[File:The japan art academy01 1024.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Japan Art Academy]]

{{Nihongo|'''Japan Art Academy'''|日本芸術院|Nihon Geijutsu-in}} is the highest ranking artistic organization in Japan.{{cn|date=November 2014}} The Academy discusses art-related issues, advises the [[Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] on art-related issues, and promotes art (fine arts, music, literature, dance and drama though the annual Japan Art Academy Award ''(Nitten''), the premier art exhibition in Japan.  As a legal entity, its status is that of a special independent organization under the aegis of the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]. Its headquarters is in [[Ueno Park]], Tokyo.

The Japan Art Academy should not be confused with the [[Japan Art Institute]], which is a completely different organization.

==History==
The Japan Art Academy was founded in 1907 as the '''Fine Arts Reviewing Committee''' (''Bijutsu Shinsa Inkai'') of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]].{{cn|date=November 2014}} It was intended to provide quality standards and a venue for art exhibitions in [[Meiji period]] Japan. The first exhibition, or ''Bunten'', was held in 1907. It was renamed the '''Imperial Fine Arts Academy''' (''Teikoku Bijutsu-in'') in 1911 and headed by [[Mori Ōgai]]. The ''Bunten'' exhibition was correspondingly renamed the ''Teiten''.

After a period where it fell into inactivity, it was reorganized into the '''Imperial Art Academy''' (帝国芸術院, ''Teikoku Geijutsuin'') in 1937. In 1947, after [[World War II]], the Imperial Art Academy became the Japan Art Academy, and its annual exhibition was correspondingly renamed the {{nihongo|Japan Arts Exhibition|日本美術展覧会|nihon bijutsu tenrankai}}, which was abbreviated to ''Nitten'' (日展).

In 1958, there was further re-organization whereby the Japan Fine Arts Academy became a solely academic and consultative non-profit organization, and the organization of the Nitten annual exhibition was handled by a separate private company, the Nitten Corporation.

==Membership==
The Japan Art Academy is under the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]]. It consists of a maximum of 120 members, who are appointed for life.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

Membership is divided into the following categories

'''A. Fine Arts'''

==Nitten==
The {{nihongo|'''Japan Fine Arts Exhibition'''|日展|Nitten (Nihon bijutsu tenrankai)}} claims to be the largest combined art exhibition of its kind in the world, attracting a great number of fans and [[art critic]]s. The exhibition consists five art categories: ''Nihonga'' and Western Style Painting, Sculpture, Crafts and Calligraphy. During each exhibition, works of the great masters are shown alongside works of the new but talented artists.

The Japan Fine Arts Exhibition decided not to award any of the top prizes in any of the 5 sections for 2013, following the revelation of fraudulent judging in the calligraphy section of the fiscal 2009 show. It was the first time since 1958, when the organization became a nonprofit corporation, that none of the prizes were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000765469|title=Nitten cancels top prizes over fraudulent judging|publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Priscilla Kay Alden''' (born October 24, 1946) is an American television writer and the former [[head writer]] for the soap opera, ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''.

==Career==
Alden began writing for ''The Young and the Restless'' as a script writer in 1974 while researching her dissertation at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lonna-saunders/chicagos-kay-alden-putting-words-in-other-mouths_b_3386692.html] She was promoted to associate head writer in 1987, then to co-[[head writer]] in 1997. [https://web.archive.org/web/20130608210240/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2013/06/06/huffington-post-charts-kay-aldens-bell-soap-opera-career]

She took over as [[head writer]] the following year when series co-creator [[William J. Bell]] stepped down from the position. With Alden as head writer, the show lost about two million viewers (most of the loss occurred in 2004 when Alden co-wrote the show with longtime ''Y&amp;R'' [[scribe]] and producer [[John F. Smith]]), but all soap operas during that period experienced a similar scale of massive audience erosion.

She quit ''The Young and the Restless'' in late 2006, and was then hired by [[Brian Frons]], president of [[ABC Daytime]], to consult on its serials ''[[All My Children]]'', ''[[General Hospital]]'' and ''[[One Life to Live]]''. She left ABC Daytime after declining ''All My Children'''s head writer position in Spring 2007, and was hired by [[Bradley Bell]] in May 2007 to be an associate head writer for another [[CBS Daytime]] drama, ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. On July 18, 2008, it was announced that Alden would be appointed co-head writer of ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' in the coming weeks. [http://www.soapcentral.com/bb/news/2008/0721-alden.php]

During the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|WGA strike]] she went under [[financial core]] status [http://www.backstage.com/bso/news_reviews/la/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003797508]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} while working for ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''.

In 2012, Alden was spotted on the set of ''The Young and the Restless'' for the taping of the show's 10,000th episode, leading many to believe she'd re-joined the show as a writer or story consultant. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120829233819/http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/photos/171067/y-r-celebrates-10-000th-episode/171080] However, this never came to pass.

On September 21, 2016, ''[[Daytime Confidential]]'' reported that after ten years since being with the show, Alden had been hired to be [[story consultant]] at Y&amp;R, under [[Sally Sussman Morina|Sally Sussman]]'s tenure as [[Head writer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giddens|first1=Jamey|url=http://daytimeconfidential.com/2016/09/21/kay-alden-returns-to-the-young-and-the-restless-exclusive|title=Kay Alden Returns to ''The Young and the Restless'' as Story Consultant (Exclusive)|date=September 21, 2016|work=[[Daytime Confidential]]|publisher=Confidential Media ([[SAY Media]])|accessdate=September 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926000228/http://daytimeconfidential.com/2016/09/21/kay-alden-returns-to-the-young-and-the-restless-exclusive|archive-date=September 26, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 2017, Daytime Confidential announced that both Alden and Sussman will be departing from the show, with [[Mal Young]] being named as the new head writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giddens|first1=Jamey|title=The Young and the Restless SHOCKER: Sally Sussman and Kay Alden to Retire; Mal Young in as New Head Writer!

'''''Le bonheur de vivre''''' (''The Joy of Life'') is a painting by [[Henri Matisse]]. Along with [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', ''Le bonheur de vivre'' is regarded as one of the pillars of early [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;[http://www.barnesfoundation.org/about/press/coverage/matisse-mystery Martha Lucy, ''Matisse Mystery'', the Barnes Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; The monumental canvas was first exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] of 1906, where its cadmium colors and spatial distortions caused a public expression of protest and outrage.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;

==Description==
In the central background of the piece is a group of figures that is similar to the group depicted in his painting ''[[The Dance (second version)|The Dance]]'' (1909–10). In the picture, there are several nude bodies of women and men in a landscape drenched with vivid color.

==Inspiration==
"The work is known to have invigorated fellow artists, especially [[Pablo Picasso]], who, in an effort to outdo Matisse in terms of shock value, immediately began work on his watershed ''Les Demoiselles D’Avignon''", writes Martha Lucy, associate curator at the Barnes Foundation.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;

James B. Cuno and Thomas Puttfarken suggest that the inspiration for the work was [[Agostino Carracci]]'s engraving of [[:image:Agostino Carracci - Reciproco Amore or Love in the Golden Age.jpg|''Reciproco Amore'' or ''Love in the Golden Age'']] after the [[:image:Pauwels Franck - "Amori"- Reciproco amore (Etá dell'oro).jpg|similarly named painting]] by the 16th-century Flemish painter [[Paolo Fiammingo]].  Based on the many similarities with the engraving, in particular its theme of pastoral fantasy and its  composition with the circle of dancers in the background, Cuno came to the conclusion that Carracci's engraving had a decisive influence on the final composition of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Cuno, ''Matisse and Agostino Carracci: A Source for the Bonheur de Vivre'', The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 122, No. 928, Special Issue Devoted to Twentieth Century Art (Jul., 1980), pp. 503–505&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/880685?uid=3739832&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104402109737 Thomas Puttfarken, ''Mutual Love and Golden Age: Matisse and ‘gli Amori de’ Carracci''], ''Burlington Magazine'' 124 (Apr. 1982): 203–208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/271 Andrew Graham-Dixon, The Dance by Henri Matisse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809003307/http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/271 |date=2014-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hilton Kramer]] ''Le bonheur de vivre'', owing to its long sequestration in the collection of the [[Barnes Foundation]] which never permitted its reproduction in color, is the least familiar of modern masterpieces. Yet this painting was Matisse's own response to the hostility his work had met with in the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905, a response that entrenched his art even more deeply in the esthetic principles that had governed his [[Fauvist]] paintings which had caused a furor and which did so on a far grander scale, too."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilton Kramer|Kramer, Hilton]], ''The Triumph of Modernism'': The Art World, 1985–2005, 2006, ''Reflections on Matisse,'' p. 162. {{ISBN|0-15-666370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The "sequestration" Kramer referred to relates to the very limited hours of the museum, when its collection was located in suburban [[Merion]], [[Pennsylvania]]; in 2012, the collection was moved to a new, more accessible facility in downtown [[Philadelphia]].)

==Conservation==
''Le bonheur de vivre'' features a large amount of cadmium sulfide-based yellow. Portions of the painting containing cadmium sulfide are turning white or brown, degrading the work. [[University of Delaware]] Prof. Robert L. Opila, in collaboration with Barbara Buckley, head of conservation at the Barnes, and Jennifer Mass, a senior scientist and head of the Scientific Research and Analysis Laboratory at Winterthur, studied the paint’s material microstructure in an attempt to determine why the cadmium sulfide is changing color.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDaily"&gt;[http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2012/dec/opila-matisse-barnes-122011.html UDaily, ''Matisse Mystery, Materials science reveals clues about pigment degrading on painting'', University of Delaware, Dec. 20, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

“It is a very disheartening phenomenon, considering the painting’s position in history,” says Opila, professor of materials science at UD.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDaily" /&gt;

Preliminary tests carried out by UD doctoral student Jonathan Church at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, show that carbon dioxide is reacting with the cadmium sulfide, causing the formation of cadmium carbonate, which is white. Also, the presence of chloride in the paint appears to be acting as a catalyst for the deterioration. Opila and his research team theorize that the binder, an oil similar to linseed oil, may be turning brown.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDaily" /&gt;

“The scientific studies being undertaken will contribute significantly to the preservation of the painting and to our understanding of the change that has taken place to the visual appearance of the painting,” says Buckley.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDaily" /&gt;

The '''Lyceum''' is a 1068-seat [[theatre]] in the [[Sheffield|City of Sheffield]], [[England]].

==History==
There has been a theatre on the site since 1879 when the Grand Varieties Theatre was built. Made of wood and originally intended to be used as a circus, the theatre was managed by the parents of the music hall comedian [[Dan Leno]] in 1883, who regularly performed there in the early stages of his career. Leno's lease came to an end in 1884 and the theatre burnt down in 1893. This was replaced by City Theatre but this was demolished six years later to make way for what is now the Lyceum.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, pp. 46 - 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Built to a traditional [[proscenium arch]] design, the Lyceum is the only surviving theatre outside [[London]] designed by the theatre architect [[W.G.R. Sprague]] and the last example of an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] auditorium in Sheffield. The statue on top of the Lyceum Theatre is [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], son of [[Zeus]] and [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]].

By the late 1950s, the Lyceum was experiencing financial difficulties and by 1966 bingo callers were keeping the rumoured threat of demolition at bay. The theatre closed in 1969 and, despite being granted [[listed building|Grade II listed status]] in 1972, planning permission was sought for its demolition in 1975. The building was saved in part due to campaigning by the Hallamshire Historic Buildings Society.

Over the years the building changed ownership many times, being used variously as a bingo hall and a rock concert venue. By the 1980s, the interior was in a state of disrepair. The theatre was bought by two Sheffield businessmen in 1985, with financial support from Sheffield City Council, and it was reclassified to Grade II* listed status. Between 1988 and 1990 the Lyceum was completely restored at a cost of £12&amp;nbsp;million.

The theatre reopened in 1990 and now serves as a venue for touring [[West End theatre|West End]] productions, as well as locally produced shows. It is part of the [[Sheffield Theatres]] complex with the neighbouring [[Crucible Theatre]] and the [[Studio Theatre (Sheffield)|Crucible Studio]].

==Home of pantomime==

The Lyceum presents one of Sheffield's annual Christmas pantomimes. For many years the pantomime attracted prominent actors and variety turns and visiting producers in the months between Christmas Eve and Easter. In the 1940s, the Lyceum began to produce its own pantomime and was soon bringing in stars of radio such as [[Morecambe and Wise]], [[Harry Secombe]] and [[Frankie Howerd]].

However, closure of the Lyceum meant that after the final pantomime performance in March 1969, Sheffield's pantomimes took place in the neighbouring [[Crucible Theatre|Crucible]]. The pantomime returned to the Lyceum in 1990s, as touring production companies were now using the venue.

In 2007, [[Sheffield Theatres]] replaced the touring companies by starting co-production with Evolution Pantomimes. Their first show ''[[Cinderella]]'' was followed by ''[[Aladdin]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 2009.

'''Melissa Joan Hart''' (born April 18, 1976) is an American actress. She is best known for her starring roles as the titular characters in the sitcoms ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'' (1991–1994), ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' (1996–2003), and ''[[Melissa &amp; Joey]]'' (2010–2015). Hart has been married to musician [[Mark Wilkerson]] since July 19, 2003; together, they have three sons.

== Early life ==
Hart was born in [[Smithtown, New York]], the first child of Paula, a producer and talent manager, and William Hart, a carpenter, [[shellfish]] purveyor, [[oyster]] hatchery worker, and entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/melissa-joan-hart/165755 |title=Melissa Joan Hart News, Melissa Joan Hart Bio and Photos |work=[[TV Guide]] |date= |accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="melissajoanhart.ning.com" /&gt; Her maternal grandfather, Stanley John Voje, was a [[U.S. Navy|Navy]] veteran and [[Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorialsolutions.com/sitemaker/sites/Haisle1/obit.cgi?user=285679Voje|title=In Memory of Stanley John Voje -- Haisley Funeral Home, Fort Pierce, FL|work=memorialsolutions.com|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart grew up in [[Sayville, New York]].

Hart's parents had four other children after Melissa: Trisha, Elizabeth, Brian, and [[Emily Hart|Emily]], who are all in acting. Her parents were divorced in the early 1990s, and she moved with her mother and siblings to [[New York City]]. In 1994, her mother married television executive Leslie Gilliams. Hart has three half-sisters: Alexandra, Samantha, and Mackenzie.&lt;ref name="melissajoanhart.ning.com" /&gt;

Hart was named after the [[Allman Brothers]] song "[[Melissa (song)|Melissa]]", while her middle name, Joan, came from her maternal grandmother. She chose Catherine as her [[confirmation name]] when she was in the eighth grade,&lt;ref name="melissajoanhart.ning.com" /&gt; but does not use it professionally.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Hart's career began at age four when she made a [[television commercial]] for a bathtub doll called Splashy.&lt;ref name="melissajoanhart.ning.com" /&gt; From then on, she appeared regularly in commercials, making 25 of them before the age of five. Other early television work included a small role in the [[miniseries]] ''Kane &amp; Abel'' in 1985, a [[guest-star]]ring role in an episode of ''[[The Equalizer]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Witchel |first=Alex |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/arts/up-coming-melissa-joan-hart-the-melissa-inside-clarissa-explains-it-all-for-us.html |title=UP and COMING – Melissa Joan Hart – The Melissa Inside Clarissa Explains It All for Us – Biography |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=August 25, 1991 |accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986, and a starring role alongside [[Katherine Helmond]] in the [[Emmy Award]]-winning TV movie ''Christmas Snow'',&lt;ref name="melissajoanhart.ning.com" /&gt;  also in 1986.

=== 1991–94: ''Clarissa Explains It All'' ===
In 1991 Hart landed the starring role on the [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'', a comedy about a teen girl in everyday situations, which was successful during its four-year run.&lt;!-- Note to editors: Nickelodeon claims five seasons, but actually the show aired from March 1991 to October 1994. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&amp;p_theme=at&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7D0CA231719BA&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Atlanta News, Sports, Atlanta Weather, Business News &amp;#124; ajc.com |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=June 23, 1991 |accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303265,00.html |title=Clarissa tackles it all |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=August 12, 1994 |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |first=Heather |last=Keets}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show brought her four consecutive [[Young Artist Award]] nominations, winning three.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite web|title=Thirteenth Annual Youth in Film Awards 1990–1991 |url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms13.htm |publisher=The Young Artist Foundation |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |postscript=. won |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ww3QZoLx?url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms13.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2011 |df= }}

Initially, after first being recognized on the streets, Hart felt embarrassed to perform on a children's show while being a teenager. Nevertheless, she was enthusiastic about the role, and "all [she] hoped for that [she] would get to do it for a while."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Hart also recorded two albums as Clarissa: ''This Is What 'Na Na' Means''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/This-What-Na-Means/dp/B000008MYZ |title=This is What "Na Na" Means: Clarissa &amp; the |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recording of ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/prokofiev-peter-wolf-saint/id264301779 Prokofiev: Peter and the Wolf – Saint-Saëns: Carnival of the Animals – Britten: Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra], on iTunes&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a year after the end of ''Clarissa Explains It All'', Hart filmed a pilot episode for a spin-off show featuring a college-aged Clarissa explaining it all about her foray into the professional world as an intern at a newspaper. As its musical theme, the show featured a slow, jazz version of its predecessor's theme song, and also starred [[Robert Klein]] as her boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5778861/watch-the-sequel-to-clarissa-explains-it-all-that-never-made-it-to-air |title=Watch the Sequel to Clarissa Explains It All That Never Made it to Air |author=Whitney Jefferson |publisher=Gawker Media |work=Gawker |accessdate=July 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713015428/http://gawker.com/5778861/watch-the-sequel-to-clarissa-explains-it-all-that-never-made-it-to-air |archivedate=July 13, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, [[St. Martin's Press]] announced that it had made a deal with Hart to publish her memoir ''Melissa Explains It All: Tales from My Abnormally Normal Life'' in the fall of 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3149">The '''Motion Picture Association''' ('''MPA''') is the international counterpart of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].

==History==
The MPA is an offshoot of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which was started in 1922 as a trade organization for the American film industry. Its task was to curb criticism of American films of the era, and give a more favourable image of the film industry.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Following [[World War II]], in 1945 its counterpart the Motion Picture Export Association of America was formed to restore the American film market, and fight the trade barriers and restrictions imposed on American films.&lt;ref  name="MPAA-India"&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion Picture Dist. Association (India) Pvt. Ltd: About Us|url=http://www.mpaa-india.org/aboutus.html|website=mpaa-india.org|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 its name was changed from the Motion Picture Export Association of America to the Motion Picture Association to more accurately reflect the global nature of audiovisual entertainment in today's international marketplace.&lt;ref name="MPAA-India" /&gt;

==About==
The '''Motion Picture Association''' and the [[Motion Picture Association International]] represent the interests of the six international producers and distributors of filmed entertainment. To do so, they promote and protect the intellectual property rights of these companies and conduct public awareness programs to highlight to movie fans around the world the importance of content protection.

The organizations act on behalf of the members of the Motion Picture Association of America. The MPA and the MPA-I have worldwide operations which are directed from their head offices in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and overseen in the Asia Pacific by a team based in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the MPA|url=http://www.mpa-i.org/our-story/|website=mpa-i.org|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright Advocates==
The MPA strives to protect the creative rights of the large corporate film makers. Its counterpart has come up with infamous slogans such as "''[[Who Makes Movies?]]''" and "''[[You can click, but you can't hide]].''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doctorow|first1=Cory|title=Who did MPAA rip off "You can click but you can't hide" from? -- UPDATED|url=http://boingboing.net/2005/02/11/who-did-mpaa-rip-off.html|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=Feb 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Activities==
Around the world the MPA helps with local law enforcement to combat [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]].

The MPA Offices in the world are:
* '''[[Motion Picture Association - Canada|MPA-Canada]]''',
* '''MPA EMEA''' ([[Europe]], [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]]), which has anti-"piracy" programs in 17 European countries
* '''[[Motion Picture Association International|MPA Asia and Pacific]]''', which has anti-"piracy" programs in 14 Asian countries
* '''MPA Latin America''', which has anti-"piracy" programs in 2 Latin American countries

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">In art history, a '''namepiece''' is an artwork after which an otherwise unnamed artist is named. There is a long history of giving [[notname]]s to artists whose identity has been lost.

The [[Master of the Life of the Virgin]] (active c. 1463 to c. 1490) and the [[Master of the Legend of the Magdalen]] (active c. 1483 – c. 1527) both named after scenes from the [[Life of the Virgin]] attributed to them, the [[Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi]] (active c. 1475 – 1500) named after his most famous panel, and the [[Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy]] (c 1470 – c 1480), named after a manuscript owned by one of his patrons.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=21276 Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy]".

Retrieved July 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Berlin Painter]] (active c. 490s-c. 460s BCE) was named by Sir [[John Beazley]] for a large lidded [[amphora]] in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], the Berlin Painter's ''namepiece''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vaseindex?lookup=Berlin+F+2160 Perseus Project.

As rights vary by country and jurisdiction, a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another. Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country. The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the "[[public sphere]]" or "[[commons]]", including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 103" /&gt;

Although the term "domain" did not come into use until the mid-18th century, the concept "can be traced back to the ancient [[Roman law|Roman Law]], as a preset system included in the property right system."&lt;ref name="Haung"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=H.|title=On public domain in copyright law| journal=Frontiers of Law in China| year=2009| volume=4| issue=2| pages=178–195| doi=10.1007/s11463-009-0011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined "many things that cannot be privately owned"&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt; as ''[[res nullius]]'', ''[[Res communis|res communes]]'', ''[[Res publica|res publicae]]'' and ''res universitatis''. The term ''res nullius'' was defined as things not yet appropriated.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, C Romans, Roads, and Romantic Creators: Traditions of Public Property in the Information Age (Winter 2003) Law and Contemporary Problems 89 at p.5, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''res communes'' was defined as "things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind, such as air, sunlight and ocean."&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt; The term ''res publicae'' referred to things that were shared by all citizens, and the term ''res universitatis'' meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome.&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt; When looking at it from a historical perspective, one could say the construction of the idea of "public domain" sprouted from the concepts of ''res communes'', ''res publicae'', and ''res universitatis'' in early Roman law.&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt;

When the first early copyright law was first established in Britain with the [[Statute of Anne]] in 1710, public domain did not appear. However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century. Instead of "public domain", they used terms such as ''[[publici juris]]'' or ''propriété publique'' to describe works that were not covered by copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| pages = 134–135| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "fall in the public domain" can be traced to mid-19th century France to describe the end of [[copyright term]]. The French poet [[Alfred de Vigny]] equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling "into the sink hole of  public domain"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| page = 154| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights, such as [[copyright]], [[patents]], and, expire or are abandoned.&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 103"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=103 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a, "little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| page = 137| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright law differs by country, and the American legal scholar [[Pamela Samuelson]] has described the public domain as being "different sizes at different times in different countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=102 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright, or intellectual property more generally, regard the public domain as a negative space; that is, it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law.&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 104"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=104 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]] this definition underlines common usage of the term ''public domain'' and equates the public domain to [[public property]] and works in copyright to [[private property]]. However, the usage of the term ''public domain'' can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by [[copyright exceptions]]. Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to [[fair use|fair-use]] rights and limitation on ownership.&lt;ref name="Boyle 2008 38"/&gt; A conceptual definition comes from Lange, who focused on what the public domain should be: "it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression, a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression".&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 104"/&gt; Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a "territory", but rather as a concept: "[T]here are certain materials – the air we breathe, sunlight, rain, space, life, creations, thoughts, feelings, ideas, words, numbers – not subject to private ownership. The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=105 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the "[[public sphere]]" or "[[commons]]", including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 103"/&gt;

=== Public domain books ===
A public-domain book is a book with no copyright, a book that was created without a license, or a book where its copyrights expired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn1Pl9Gv_EMC&amp;dq=public%20domain&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind|first=James|last=Boyle|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; or have been forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gK6OI0hrANsC&amp;dq=%22public%20domain%22%20intellectual%20property&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Intellectual Property and Traditional Cultural Expressions in a Digital Environment|first1=Christoph Beat|last1=Graber|first2=Mira Burri|last2=Nenova|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most countries the [[List of countries' copyright lengths|term of protection]] of copyright lasts until January first, 70 years after the death of the latest living author. The longest copyright term is in Mexico, which has life plus 100 years for all deaths since July 1928.

A notable exception is the United States, where every book and tale written prior to 1923 is in the public domain; American copyrights last for 95 years for books written between 1923 and 1978.

For example: the works of [[Jane Austen]], [[Lewis Carroll]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] are in the public domain worldwide as they all died over one hundred years ago.

[[Project Gutenberg]] makes tens of thousands of public domain books available online as [[ebook]]s.

===Public domain music===
{{Main article|Public domain music}}
People have been creating music for millennia. The first [[musical notation]] system, the [[Music of Mesopotamia]] system, was created 4000 years ago. [[Guido of Arezzo]] introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th Century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducability have lead to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.

U.S. copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation and/or lyrics created by a composer and/or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf|title=Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings|publisher=United States Copyright Office|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published prior to 1922 is considered public domain. Sound recordings, on the other hand, are subject to different rules and are not eligible for public domain status until 2049-2067, depending on the date and location of publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain |title= Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate= October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Musopen]] project records music in the public domain for the purposes of making the music available to the general public in a high-quality audio format. Online musical archives preserve collections of classical music recorded by Musopen and offer them for download/distribution as a public service.

===Public domain films===
{{Main article|Public domain film}}
A '''public-domain film''' is a [[film]] that was released to public domain by its author or because its [[copyright]] has expired. In 2016 there are more than 2,000 films on public domain in every genre, from musicals to romance, horror to animated movies and noir to western movies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Value==
Pamela Samuelson has identified eight "values" that can arise from information and works in the public domain.&lt;ref name="Guibault 2006 xx"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Guibault |first= Lucy |author2= Bernt Hugenholtz |title= The future of the public domain: identifying the commons in information law |publisher= Kluwer Law International |year= 2006 |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&amp;dq=public+domain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn= 978-9-0411-24357 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141218080732/http://www.google.com/books?id=KJmNGglq0nwC&amp;dq=public+domain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate= 18 December 2014 |df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perpetual copyright==
{{Main article|Perpetual copyright}}
Some works may never fully lapse into the public domain. A perpetual [[crown copyright]] is held for the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce M. |last=Metzger |title=The Oxford companion to the Bible|year=2006 |publisher= Oxford Univ. Press |location= Oxford |isbn=978-0-1950-46458 |pages=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the copyright has expired for the Peter Pan works by [[J. M. Barrie]] (the play ''[[Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]''  and the novel ''Peter and Wendy'') in the United Kingdom, it was granted a special exception under the Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act 1988 (Schedule 6)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_28.htm |title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48) |work=Office of Public Sector Information |year=1988 |page=28 |accessdate=2 September 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601225021/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_28.htm |archivedate=1 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that requires royalties to be paid for commercial performances, publications and broadcasts of the story of Peter Pan within the UK, as long as [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] (to whom Barrie gave the copyright) continues to exist.

In a [[paying public domain]] regime, works that have entered the public domain after their copyright has expired, or traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions that have never been subject to copyright, are still subject to royalties payable to the state or to an authors' association. The user does not have to seek permission to copy, present or perform the work, but does have to pay the fee. Typically the royalties are directed to support of living artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=24 November 2010 |publisher=Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore: Seventeenth Session

{{Main article|Public Domain Mark}}
[[File:Cc-public_domain_mark_white.svg |thumb |150px|[[Creative Commons]]' [[Public Domain Mark]]]]
The [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] proposed in 2010 the ''[[Public Domain Mark]]'' (PDM) as [[symbol]] to indicate that a work is free of known [[copyright]] restrictions and therefore in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Creative-Commons-announces-the-Public-Domain-Mark-1106052.html |title= Creative Commons announces the Public Domain Mark |publisher=[[The H]] |work=The H Open |accessdate=12 October 2010 |date=12 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101016044229/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Creative-Commons-announces-the-Public-Domain-Mark-1106052.html |archivedate= 16 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23830 |title= Improving Access to the Public Domain: the Public Domain Mark |publisher= Creative Commons |author=Diane Peters |accessdate=12 October 2010 |date=11 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014022853/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23830 |archivedate= 14 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The public domain mark is analogous to the [[copyright symbol]], which acts as [[copyright notice]]. The [[Europeana]] databases use it, and for instance on the [[Wikimedia Commons]] in February 2016 2.9 million works (~10% of all works) are listed as ''PDM''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:CC-PD-Mark Category:CC-PD-Mark ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312115401/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category%3ACC-PD-Mark |date=12 March 2016 }} in February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to copyrightable works==

===Works not covered by copyright law===
The underlying idea that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law (see [[idea–expression divide]]). Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.

Works created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain.  For example, [[the Bible]] and the inventions of [[Archimedes]] are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.

===Expiry of copyright===
Determination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.

In the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because [[copyright term]]s have been extended multiple times and in different ways—shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with [[copyright renewal|a possible renewal term]], to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.  The claim that "pre-1923 works are in the public domain" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.

In most other countries that are signatories to the [[Berne Convention]], copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)

Legal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain.  Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]], which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based [[copyright formalities |formalities requirements]].  Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements—a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Karjala]], "Judicial Oversight of Copyright Legislation", 35 N.

[[Work of the United States Government|Works of the United States Government]] and various other governments are excluded from copyright law and may therefore be considered to be in the public domain in their respective countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf Copyright Office Basics] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225235545/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf |date=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be in the public domain in other countries as well. The legal scholar Melville Nimmer has written that "it is axiomatic that material in the public domain is not protected by copyright, even when incorporated into a copyrighted work".&lt;ref&gt;[[Melville Nimmer |Nimmer, Melville B.]], and David Nimmer (1997). ''[[Nimmer on Copyright]]'', section 13.03(F)(4). Albany: Matthew Bender.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dedicating works to the public domain===

==== Release without copyright notice ====
Before 1988 in the US, works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit [[Copyright notice]]. With the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which went into effect in 1978), all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a [[waiver]] statement/[[anti-copyright notice|anti-copyright can call notice]].&lt;ref name="cornelledu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |title=Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States |publisher= |accessdate= 30 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926203654/http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |archivedate=26 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="copyrightgov"&gt;''[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf Copyright Notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926110554/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf |date=26 September 2012 }}'', U.S. Copyright Office Circular 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain, e.g. [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of [[continental Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} This may even "effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]]".&lt;ref name="aboutcc0"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0 |title= About CC0 — "No Rights Reserved" |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate= 23 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130428010038/http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0 |archivedate= 28 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public-domain-like licenses ====
{{main article|Public domain equivalent license}}
An alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public. Real public domain makes [[license]]s unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission ("[[Permission culture]]"). There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain. In 2000 the [[WTFPL]] was released as a public domain like [[software license]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130602181949/http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-wmaker/trunk/COPYING.WTFPL?revision=2&amp;view=markup Version 1.0 license] on anonscm.debian.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Creative commons]] released the [[Creative Commons license#Zero .2F public domain|CC0]], which was created for [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with law domains which have no concept of ''dedicating into public domain''. This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back all-permissive license, in case the waiver is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://creativecommons.org/2009/06/17/1117-lulan-artisans-textile-competition/ |title= 11/17: Lulan Artisans Textile Competition |date=17 June 2009 |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231080413/https://creativecommons.org/2009/06/17/1117-lulan-artisans-textile-competition/ |archivedate=31 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC0"&gt;[https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/cc0-analysis-kreuzer.pdf Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law] by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in [[Berlin, Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unlicense]], published around 2010, has a focus on an [[Anti-copyright]] message. The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324154539/http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license |date=24 March 2016 }} on ostatic.com by Joe Brockmeier (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unlicense.org The Unlicense] on unlicense.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] recommends the Creative Commons [[CC0]] license to dedicate content to the public domain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefinition.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (27 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)'' for data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/ pddl] on opendatacommons.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patents==
{{Main article|Term of patent}}
In most countries, the term of rights for patents is 20 years, after which the invention becomes part of the public domain. In the United States, the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for 20 years from the date of filing within the United States or 20 years from the earliest date of filing if under 35 USC 120, 121, or 365(c).&lt;ref&gt;Manual of Patent Examining Procedure available at {{cite web |url= http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2701.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150418103411/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2701.html |archivedate= 18 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''text'' and any ''illustration'' within a patent, provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the "personality" of the person drawing them, are not subject to copyright protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uspto.gov/main/ccpubguide.htm |title= Terms of Use for USPTO Websites |first= Office of the Chief Communications |last=Officer |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090925103511/http://www.uspto.gov/main/ccpubguide.htm |archivedate= 25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is separate from the ''patent'' rights just mentioned.

==Trademarks==
A trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely, or expire without specific regard to its age. For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become [[genericized trademark|generic]], and therefore part of the public domain.

Because trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug "acetylsalicylic acid" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as ''[[aspirin]]'' in the United States—a generic term. In Canada, however, "Aspirin", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company [[Bayer]], while aspirin, with a lowercase "a", is not. Bayer lost the trademark in the United States, the UK and France after World War I, as part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofmolecules.com/drugs/aspirin.htm Aspirin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824141625/http://www.worldofmolecules.com/drugs/aspirin.htm |date=24 August 2005 }}, World of Molecules&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer also lost the trademark in the same jurisdictions for "Heroin" which it trademarked a year before it trademarked Aspirin.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Although [[Hormel]] resigned itself to genericide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spam.com/about/internet.aspx |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091013192409/http://www.spam.com/about/internet.aspx |dead-url= yes |archive-date=13 October 2009 |title=SPAM® Brand and the Internet |publisher= Hormel Foods}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has fought attempts by other companies to register "[[spam (food)|spam]]" as a [[trademark]] [[spamming|in relation to computer products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/31/spam_ruling/ |title=Hormel Spam trademark case canned |author=Kieren McCarthy |date=31 January 2005 |accessdate=2 September 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080707001848/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/31/spam_ruling/ |archivedate=7 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Domain Day ==
{{main article|Public Domain Day}}
[[File:Logo PDD 2016.svg |thumb|An English logo of the 2015/2016 Public Domain Day in Poland]]

Public Domain Day is an observance of when [[copyright]]s expire and works enter into the public domain.&lt;ref name="telcouk"&gt;{{cite web |last= Richmond |first=Shane |url= http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/100004467/happy-public-domain-day-heres-to-many-more/ |title=Happy Public Domain Day!

'''Puig''' is a Spanish company operating in the [[fashion]] and [[perfume|fragrance]] sectors. The company was founded in 1914 by Antoni Puig i Castelló in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The company is still managed by the Puig family.

Puig markets its products in 150 countries and is directly present in 22 of them, employing 4,472 people worldwide.&lt;ref name="data17"/&gt; In 2017, it reached €1.935 billion in net revenues and €228 million in [[net income]].&lt;ref name="datos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/noticia/article/4-economia/18-economia/395845-el-benefici-net-del-grup-puig-creix-un-57.html | title =  El benefici net del grup Puig creix un 57% | accessdate = 26 April 2012 | publisher = El Punt Avui}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="datos11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expansion.com/2012/04/12/catalunya/1334231403.html?a=3b0ec98442bd89b11495f60da8e9f5f2&amp;t=1335718103 | title = Puig profit improves 19% to over 1,300 million in sales | accessdate = 29 April 2012 | publisher = Expansion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="datos12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistavpc.es/noticias/2074-puig-crece-un-11-gracias-a-su-apuesta-por-los-mercados-internacionales.html | title = Puig crece un 11% gracias a su apuesta por los mercados internacionales | accessdate = 29 November 2014 | publisher = Revista VPC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="datos13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noticiasbancarias.com/general/07/04/2014/puig-aumenta-su-beneficio-un-2-en-2013/59258.html | title = Puig aumenta su beneficio un 2% en 2013 | accessdate = 29 November 2014 | publisher = Noticias Bancarias}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="data14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europapress.es/economia/noticia-comunicado-puig-supera-2014-1500-ventas-proyecta-alcanzar-2000-2017-20150416140342.html | title = http://www.europapress.es/economia/noticia-comunicado-puig-supera-2014-1500-ventas-proyecta-alcanzar-2000-2017-20150416140342.html | accessdate = 26 June 2015 | publisher = Europapress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="data15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agendaempresa.com/71968/puig-crece-en-ventas-pero-reduce-su-beneficio-en-2015/ | title = Puig crece en ventas pero reduce su beneficio en 2015 | accessdate = 2 June 2016 | publisher = Agenda Empresa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="data17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/empresas/2018-04-12/resultados-empresariales-puig-perfumes-record_1548795/ | title = Puig bate récords de ventas y beneficios y lanza una plataforma para atraer I+D | accessdate = 11 June 2018 | publisher = El Confidencial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Establishment and early years ===
[[File:Grup Puig, travessera de Gràcia.jpg|thumb|Former Puig headquarters, in [[Travessera de Gràcia]], Barcelona]]
The company's origins date back to 1914 when Antonio Puig Castelló founded the company. Initially the company took the name of its founder, being called '''Antonio Puig [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]]'''. From the beginning, the company oriented its business towards the [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] and [[perfume|fragrance]] sectors.&lt;ref name="inicio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.emprendedores.es/empresa/empresas_de_exito/puig_se_rie_de_la_crisis/puig_de_barcelona_al_mundo | title = From Barcelona to the World | accessdate = 26 April 2012 | publisher = Emprendedores | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6FkjKlfNk?url=http://www.emprendedores.es/casos_de_exito/puig_se_rie_de_la_crisis/puig_de_barcelona_al_mundo | archivedate = 9 April 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the company marketed ''Milady'', the first [[lipstick]] made in Spain.&lt;ref name="historia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.modaes.es/empresa/130411/puig-un-imperio-espanol-de-moda-que-comenzo-con-un.html | title = Puig, a Spanish fashion empire that started with a lipstick | accessdate = 26 April 2012 |  publisher =Modaes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s the company started marketing the fragrance Agua Lavanda Puig,&lt;ref name="water"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.telva.com/2007/09/25/estarguapafragancias/1190740172.html | title = Colonies with history | accessdate = 27 April 2012 | publisher = Telva}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became one of the flagship products of the company.&lt;ref name="water2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.soitu.es/soitu/2008/08/04/tendencias/1217848753_590350.html | title = Classic you share with your mother and your grandmother | accessdate = 27 April 2012 | publisher = Soitu.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; During those same years, the founder Antonio Puig decided to move the factory and offices to a building located in [[Travessera de Gràcia]] street, in the [[Gràcia]] district in [[Barcelona]], where the headquarters of the company still remain today.&lt;ref name="edificio"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.expansion.com/accesible/2011/01/14/catalunya/1295040398.html | title =Puig will move to a building designed by Moneo CatalunyaCaixa | accessdate = 26 April 2012 |publisher = Expansion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, the four sons of the founder joined the company. Although the transition took place gradually, Antonio Puig eventually delegated its decision-making to his sons: Antonio and Mariano would focus on the perfume area, Jose Maria on the diversification department, and Enrique on the institutional relationships.&lt;ref name="historia" /&gt;

=== International expansion ===

The international expansion of the company began in 1959 with the building of a new factory in the industrial estate [[El Besòs i el Maresme|Besòs]], in Barcelona, and also with the creation of the first branch office outside Spain, in the United States. The US branch office was boosted by a letter written by a Spanish student in the [[University of Iowa]], who lamented the impossibility of buying Agua Lavanda Puig in the US, as it was confirmed years later by company sources.&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.expansion.com/accesible/2011/06/14/catalunya/1308063423.html | title = Puig Valentino paraded in Rome | accessdate = 26 April 2012 | publisher = Expansion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Puig opened a branch office in Paris, at the same time that the company incorporated the Spanish designer brand [[Paco Rabanne]]. In 1969, as a result of this collaboration the fragrance ''Calandre'' began to be marketed.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;La Vanguardia, October 9, 2011, Supplement  Diners, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976,  the company built a perfumery factory in [[Chartres]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="Chartres"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/2005/03/15/pagina-43/34731561/pdf.html?search=Chartres%20puig | title = To be multinational in Spain costs a lot, because the domestic market is too small | accessdate = 9 May 2012 | publisher = La Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Puig acquired Paco Rabanne's Fashion House.&lt;ref name="PRabanne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/gente/20101111/paco-rabanne-premio-nacional-moda/587321.shtml| title = Paco Rabanne, Premio Nacional de Moda | accessdate = 21 January 2013 | publisher = ElPeriódico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key milestones in the international expansion was the agreement reached in the 1980s with the Venezuelan designer [[Carolina Herrera (fashion designer)|Carolina Herrera]] in [[New York City]] to create and market all her fragrances. Years later, in 1995, Carolina Herrara fashion business area also joined Puig.

In January 2015, Puig acquired fragrance brands Penhaligons and L'Artisan Parfumeur.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;

=== Name change: Puig Beauty &amp; Fashion Group ===

In 1997,  Puig reached an agreement with [[Antonio Banderas]] for the creation and subsequent commercialization of the brand '' Antonio Banderas Fragrances''. The following year the company acquired the brand [[Nina Ricci (brand)|Nina Ricci]], keeping up with the policy of acquiring prestigious brands.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; Due to business growth, in 1999 the Puig family refounded the company, renaming it '''Puig Beauty &amp; Fashion Group''', but maintaining the same structure and the three business lines: fashion, fragrances and cosmetics.

In line with its expansion policy, Puig acquired Spanish companies Perfumes Gal and [[Myrurgia]].&lt;ref name="gal"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://elpais.com/diario/1995/03/15/economia/795222008_850215.html | title = Antonio Puig enters the capital of displacing Palmolive Gal Perfumes | accessdate = 29 April 2012 | publisher = El País}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myrurgia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://elpais.com/diario/2000/07/19/economia/963957622_850215.html | title = Puig buy the company Myrurgia family colonies Monegal |accessdate = 29 April 2012 | publisher = El País}}&lt;/ref&gt; These operations strengthened
Puig leadership in the Spanish market. Also as the result of these procurements the brands [[Adolfo Dominguez]], [[Massimo Dutti]] and [[Heno de Pravia]], among others, were assimilated into Puig.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adolfo"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2000/08/04/143455.shtml | title = Puig is the second largest shareholder by Adolfo Dominguez to buy Myrurgia | accessdate = 29 April 2012 | publisher = La Voz de Galicia | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6FkjWSLyQ?url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/hemeroteca/2000/08/04/143455.shtml | archivedate = 9 April 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Japanese fashion firm [[Comme des Garçons]] joined the company and only a year later it was the turn of the Italian [[Prada]]. Both companies became part of Puig’s catalogue of fragrances.&lt;ref name="Comme"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hola.com/belleza/actualidad/2002091647764/belleza/actualidad/noticiacommegarconspuig/ | title = Comme Des Garcons, new signing Puig | accessdate = 29 April 2012 | publisher = ¡Hola!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prada"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.economiadigital.es/es/notices/2011/12/puig_invierte_20_millones_en_prada_24999.php | title = Puig invests 20 million in Prada |accessdate = 29 April 2012 | publisher = Economía digital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, there were changes in the company’s managing team, with [[Marc Puig]], member of the third generation of the family, becoming the new General Director&lt;ref name="cúpula"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://elpais.com/diario/2004/06/20/negocio/1087736609_850215.html | title = The new fragrance of the young Puig | accessdate = 26 April 2012 | publisher = El País}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually CEO in 2007, leaving Manuel Puig as vice president.&lt;ref name="cúpula2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eleconomista.es/empresas-finanzas/noticias/170149/02/07/Marc-Puig-releva-a-Javier-Cano-primer-presidente-no-familiar-del-grupo-Puig.html | title = Marc Puig relieve Javier Cano, first president of Puig unfamiliar | accessdate = 26 April 2012 | publisher = El Economista}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the new management reached an agreement with the [[Colombia]]n singer [[Shakira]] for the development of her fragrances.&lt;ref name="shakira"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.noticiascadadia.com/noticia/11230-shakira-y-puig-crean-una-nueva-linea-de-productos-de-belleza/ | title = Shakira and Puig created a new line of beauty products | accessdate = 26 April 2012 | publisher = Ideal | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103101610/http://www.noticiascadadia.com/noticia/11230-shakira-y-puig-crean-una-nueva-linea-de-productos-de-belleza/ | archivedate = 3 November 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puig today ===
[[File:PUIG TORRE.jpg|thumb|Torre Puig, [[Plaza Europa]], [[Hospitalet de Llobregat]]  ([[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]])]]
In 2009 Puig Beauty &amp; Fashion Group changed its trade name for the second time, becoming known simply as '''Puig'''.&lt;ref name="Nombre"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alimarket.es/noticia/14245/Puig-sustituye-a-Puig-Beauty---Fashion-Group | title = Puig lost their surnames | accessdate = 26 April 2012 | publisher = Alimarket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest brands to be incorporated into the Puig structure are the ones from the Italian designer [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]] (in 2010)&lt;ref name="Valentino"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20120112/54244283012/puig-negocia-permira-compra-valentino.html | title = Puig talks with Permira to buy Valentino | accessdate = 26 April 2012 | publisher = La Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and French [[Jean Paul Gaultier]]. For this last one, Puig also became the majority shareholder, buying the 45% of the shares Jean Paul Gaultier Fashion House from the French group [[Hermès]] and 10% of Jean Paul Gaultier himself, who nevertheless retained the artistic direction of the brand that bears his name.&lt;ref name="Gaultier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/gente/20110503/54149066418/puig-compra-a-hermes-el-45-de-jean-paul-gaultier.html | title = Puig takes control of the brand Jean-Paul Gaultier | accessdate = 26 April 2012 | publisher = La Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2013, Puig moved its headquarters in [[France]] to the well known [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Paris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=1443102 | title = Puig traslada su sede corporativa en Francia a los Campos Elíseos de París | publisher = ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the company celebrated the centenary of its establishment with the inauguration of the new headquarters, located in [[Plaza de Europa]] of [[Hospitalet de Llobregat]], called Torre Puig. This tower is a work of  architect [[Rafael Moneo]], laureate of the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]], and GCA Arquitectos. The building was inaugurated by the [[Prince of Asturias]]. The Tower got the Leed Gold certificate, in recognition for the building's environmental quality. At the entrance of the building there is a statue from [[Joan Miró]], ceded for 2 years by [[Fundació Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name="Torre1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elfar.cat/not/6453/puig_cumple_100_anos_inaugurando_su_nueva_sede_corporativa_en_l_hospitalet/ | title = Puig cumple 100 años inaugurando su sede corporativa en la Plaza Europa |  publisher = El Far}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Torre2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20140407/54404792258/principes-artur-mas-coinciden-inauguracion-nueva-sede-puig.html | title = Los Príncipes y Artur Mas coinciden en la inauguración de la nueva sede de Puig |  publisher = La Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Torre3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europapress.es/economia/noticia-economia-empresas-principes-inauguran-nueva-sede-puig-centenario-firma-20140407131246.html | title = Los Príncipes inauguran la nueva sede de Puig en el centenario de la firma |  publisher = Europa Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Torre4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europapress.es/comunicados/empresas/noticia-comunicado-altezas-reales-principes-asturias-girona-inauguran-nueva-sede-corporativa-puig-20140407181017.html | title = COMUNICADO: Sus Altezas Reales Los Príncipes de Asturias y Girona inauguran la nueva sede corporativa de Puig |  publisher = Europa Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Puig in numbers ==
Puig currently has five production plants, four of them located in Europe and another in Mexico, producing 331 million units of perfume each year. With that production, in 2010 Puig reached a worldwide share of 7.6% of the fragrance business, whereas five years earlier its global share was 3.5%. This means that Puig obtained 35% of the worldwide growth within this five-year period.&lt;ref name="datos "/&gt;

Puig commercializes its products in 150 countries and is directly present in 22 of them, employing 4,472 people worldwide. In 2015, turnover reached 1935 million euros in net revenues and 228 million euros in net income.&lt;ref name="datos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="datos11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="datos12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="datos13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="data14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="data15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="data17"/&gt;

== Engagement with the sailing world==
[[File:Barco Regata Puig.jpg|thumb|One of the classic boats in 2010 ''Puig Vela Clàssica'' regatta]]

The Puig family has always been strongly linked to the [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]] world, especially in the figure of the late Enrique Puig, director of the company, president of the Salón Náutico and the [[Royal Barcelona Yacht Club]]. The company was the sponsor of the [[Copa del Rey de Vela]] from 1984 to 2006.&lt;ref name="Enrique"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/09/20/obituarios/1221915621.html | title = Enrique Puig, the union of perfume and sports | accessdate = 9 May 2012 | publisher = World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puig was the [[Ship-owner|shipowner]] and sponsor of the [[sailing boat|sailing]] «Azur de Puig». This boat participated in the most important sailing events worldwide. One of the usual crew of the sailboat was the [[Infanta Cristina]], youngest daughter of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]].&lt;ref name="Infanta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-08-08-2005/abc/Gente/do%C3%B1a-cristina-se-reincorporo-al-azur-de-puig-la-ultima-jornada_2156282322.html | title = Cristina joined the 'Azur de Puig "the last day | accessdate = 9 May 2012 | publisher = ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, in collaboration with the Royal Barcelona Yacht Club, the company boosts and sponsors the "Puig Vela Clàssica" race, which is held in [[Barcelona]] waters in July every year.&lt;ref name="velaclásica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/otros/20110704/54180981508/trias-presenta-la-iv-puig-vela-classica.html | title = Trias IV presents the Vela Clàssica Puig | accessdate =9 May 2012 | publisher = La Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main feature of this race is that it is reserved for traditional and classical boats only. This regatta is one of the main classical sailboats races of all those celebrated worldwide.&lt;ref name="clásica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/otros/20110705/54181311261/cincuenta-veleros-participaran-en-la-regata-de-vela-clasica-de-barcelona.html | title = Fifty sailboat regatta will participate in the Barcelona Classic Sailing | accessdate = 9 May 2012 | publisher = La Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fauteuil racine Chine Quianlong musee arts asiatiques Nice.jpg|thumbnail|Chinese armchair made from roots. [[Qing dynasty]], [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong era]], 18th century]]
'''Root carving''' is a traditional [[Chinese art]] form. It consists of carving and polishing tree [[root]]s into various artistic creations.

==History==
Using roots to make necessities has been practiced since primitive society. Like other artistic crafts, art of roots produced from primitive labor. The earliest root carvings are “辟邪” and “角形器” showing up in the [[Warring States period]].

In the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, root carving works not only prevailed in folk, but they were also cherished by the governing class. In the Tang dynasty, people laid emphasis on the natural forms of roots, cleverly taking advantage of the effect of corrosion and moth-eaten.

In the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties, art of root carving not only developed in the court and folk, but also appeared in grottoes and temples. Roots were used to carve the statues of the [[Buddha]], always comparing favorably with the clay.

==Features==
[[File:Root carving in Haikou - 06.JPG|thumb|150px|A craftsman works on a piece in [[Haikou]] City, [[Hainan]] Province. His shop is located in an area beside East Lake, part of [[Haikou People's Park]]. The area contains dozens of small shops dedicated to producing root carvings.]]

Root carving preserves natural beauty.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}} Ancient artists created lifelike and vivid works by a special technique using expression based on the roots' natural forms. This kind of creation is not completely artificial, but created by both human beings and nature.

Root carving is different from [[engraving]]. It combines peculiarity with ingeniousness. Although its aesthetic principals share common ground with engraving, at the same time they are applied uniquely. The common ground is that they share expressive techniques of [[wood carving]], [[sculpture]], [[stone carving]] and so on, overcoming weaknesses by acquiring others strong points. The difference lies in the natural shape of roots. During the creative process, root carving mostly maintains the natural form of the root, adding some artificial polishing. In other words, root carving is guided by the inherent qualities of the root, rather than by shaping images merely through carving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.genpen.com/genyi/jieshao/9661.html |title=根雕艺术的特点 |publisher=News.genpen.com |date=2010-03-07 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gzzhuhai.com/news-22.aspx |title=根雕艺术发展史 |publisher=Gzzhuhai.com |date=2011-06-23 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Necessities==
{{peacock|date=May 2015}}
Creative effect achieved from the same material can vary from artist to artist. Within the field three factors are considered of major importance.

'''Shilpgram''' is a rural arts and crafts complex, situated {{Cvt|3|km}} west of the city of [[Udaipur]], India. The center is spread over an undulating terrain of about 70 acres of land, surrounded by the [[Aravalli Range|Aravali]] mountains. Shilpgram is an ethnographic museum that depicts the lifestyles of the folk and tribal people of the region. With an objective of increasing awareness and knowledge about the rural arts and crafts, the Shilpgram provides opportunity to rural and urban artists to come together and interact through the process of camps and workshops.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.shilpgram.in/Shilpgram-Udaipur.htm  Shilpgram- introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mandana art work at shilpgram.JPG|thumb|right|300px]]

== Description ==
The Complex has an open air Amphitheatre with a seating capacity of approximately 8000, used for the major theatre festivals held here, and the traditional folk performing arts. Each member state of the [[Western India|West Zone]] has traditional huts built within the Shilpgram, derivative of certain basic occupations fundamental to the way of life of the people of the area and also central to the culture of the country. In these traditional huts, household articles of everyday use, like terracotta, textile, wooden and metal items, decorative objects and implements are featured with appropriate signage and explanatory details with the objective to give a realistic glimpse of the people and their belongings.

The huts are constructed around an interlocking occupational theme. In this integrated pattern are five huts from [[Rajasthan]], representing the weavers' community from [[Marwar]], pottery from the hilly areas of [[Mewar]] and the tribal farmer communities of the [[Bhil]] and the Sehariyas .Apart from the state's own representation, there are seven representative huts from the state of [[Gujarat]], five from the state of [[Maharashtra]] and five featuring the arts and crafts of [[Goa]].

== Shilpgram Festival ==
The Shilpgram Festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udaipur.rajasthan.gov.in/content/raj/udaipur/en/about-udaipur/festivals.html|title= Udaipur-Festivals ]&lt;/ref&gt; is organised every year from 21 December to 31 December. The Shilpgram Fair (''Shilpgram Mela''), a part of the festive celebrations, serves as a destination for hand woven clothes, embroideries, mirror works and handicrafts.The Mela aids in encouraging the urban potters, visual artists and designers and the cottage industry of Rajasthan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udaipur.org.uk/fairs-festivals/about-shilpgram-fair.html Shilpgram Fair]&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival provides opportunities for learning the craft skills through various workshops. Cultural programmes during the evening and the local food stalls attract many visitors and locals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://touristattractionsudaipur.com/shilpgram-mela-in-udaipur.aspx Shilpgram Mela] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028212132/http://touristattractionsudaipur.com/shilpgram-mela-in-udaipur.aspx |date=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shilpdarshan== 
Shilpdarshan is a continuing activity at Shilpgram in which traditional performing artists and craftsmen are used to draw from the interior villages of the member states. They are regularly invited to exhibit their skill and to demonstrate their crafts, and sell their works in order to have direct access to the buyers. This programme has been initiated with an aim to encourage  rural craftsmen and performers.

A '''skipping rhyme''' (occasionally '''skipping-rope rhyme''' or '''jump-rope rhyme'''), is a [[rhyme]] [[chant]]ed by children while [[skipping rope|skipping]]. Such rhymes have been recorded in all cultures where skipping is played. Examples of English-language rhymes have been found going back to at least the 17th century. Like most [[folklore]], skipping rhymes tend to be found in many different variations. The article includes those chants used by English speaking children.&lt;!---only. poetry and jokes translate badly, particularly when metre is required. Thus, not "worldwide"---&gt;

==History==
Explorers reported seeing aborigines jumping with vines in the 16th century. European boys started jumping rope in the early 17th century. The activity was considered indecent for girls because they might show their ankles. There were no associated chants. This changed in the early 18th century. Girls began to jump rope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skip-hop.co.uk/history-of-skipping-c28.html|title=The History of Skipping|last=Robert-Shaw|first=Scott|date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They added the chants, owned the rope, controlled the game, and decided who participated.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historicalfolktoys.com/catcont/92001.html |title=The Jump Rope Book |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |date=1996 |publisher=''HistoricalFolkToys.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, domination of the activity by girls occurred when their families moved into the cities in the late 19th century. There, they found sidewalks and other smooth surfaces conducive to jumping rope, along with a host of contemporaries.&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

Another source suggests that, prior to 1833, the invention of [[Pantalettes|pantalettes]], enabled girls to jump rope without displaying ankles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/340 |title="Jumping Rope [Advice Book]," in Children and Youth in History, Item #340 |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |year=1833 |publisher=''Chnm.gmu.edu'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chants are intended to structure the game and are secondary, explaining the nonsense or irrational lyrics. These chants are unusual inasmuch as they were transmitted from child to child usually without an underlying reason, as opposed to nursery rhymes which were transmitted from adult to child and often contained a moral. Chants may contain girlish references to boyfriends or marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/jump-rope-rhyme |title=Jump rope rhyme |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |date=December 7, 2015 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of chants==
Two girls with a long rope stood about {{convert|12|ft}} apart and turned the rope as other children took turns jumping. If one were not a good jumper, one would be an 'Ever-Laster,' that is, one would perpetually turn the rope. When it was a child's turn to jump, she would enter as the rope turned, and jump to the rhyme until she missed. Then she would become a rope-turner, and the next child in line would take her place.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Jump in, jump out ===
For a line of potential jumpers, the jumpers were restricted on time by the length of the chant/ They jumped in at the beginning, jumped out at the end and the next jumper took their turn.

:Charlie Chaplin went to France
:To teach the ladies how to dance.
:First the heel, then the toe,
:Then the splits, and around you go!
:Salute to the Captain,
:Bow to the Queen,
:And turn your back on the [[Nazi]] submarine!

In another version, the teacher is "Benjamin Franklin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.buyjumpropes.net/resources/jump-rope-rhymes-songs-buyjumpropesnet/ |title=The Great List of Jump Rope Rhymes &amp; Skipping Songs |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |author=Matt Hopkins |date=July 5, 2014 |publisher=buyjumpropes.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Charlie Chaplin rhyme, the child jumping had to follow directions as the rope was turning: touching the heel of one foot on the ground; touching the toe of the same foot on the ground; doing a (short) split of the feet, turning around, saluting, bowing, and jumping out from the turning rope on the last line. This rhyme, c. 1942, reflects children's awareness of World War II (The Queen to whom we bowed was the mother of the present Queen of England).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

An Australian version of the Charlie Chaplin Skipping Song, as sung at Salisbury Primary School in Brisbane, Australia in the mid 1950s, is as follows:

:Charlie Chaplin went to France,
:To teach the ladies how to dance,
:First he did the Rumba,
:Then he did the twist,
:Then he did the Highland Fling,
:And then he did the splits.

There's also "Betty Grable went to France,/To teach the soldiers how to dance."  (The rest is the same.){{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

:Had a little car car,
:Two-forty-eight,
:Ran around the cor-(''skipper jumps out, and turners continue the syllable until they reenter'')-ner
:and slammed on the brakes, but the brakes didn't work,
:So I bumped into a lady who bumped into a man,
:Who bumped into a police car, man, oh man!
:Policeman caught me
:Put me on his knee,
:Asked me a question
:Will you marry me?
:Yes, No, Maybe So (repeated)

:All in together, birds of a feather:
:January, February, March, April, May, etc. (each child had to jump in during the month they were born).

:I see London, I see France,
:I see (xxx)s underpants,
:Not too big, not too small,
:Just the size of Montreal (or just the size of cannonball, Berlin Wall, etc.)
Another variation:
: I see London, I see France, I see (xxx)s underpants.
: Are they blue? Are they pink? I don't know but they sure stink!
: Teacher, teacher, I declare, I see (xxx)s underwear (or bottoms bare)

====Political statement====
In [[Dublin]], Ireland, the visits of inspectors known as "[[Glimmer Man|Glimmer men]]" to private houses to enforce regulations to prevent the use of coal gas in restricted hours during the [[The Emergency (Ireland)|Emergency]] gave rise to:&lt;ref name='glimmer1'&gt;{{cite web | url = www.hubpages.com/hub/World-War-Two-the-Emergency-Ration-books-in-Stoneybatter-Dublin-7-Ireland | title = Remembering Rationing and Bombs during World War Two in Dublin Ireland | accessdate = 2011-03-18 | last = Reid | first = L.M. | year = 2010 | publisher = ''Hubpages.com'' | quote = Yes we had a rhyme we sang when we played skipping out in the street. It was about the gas rationing and the glimmer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:Keep it boiling on the glimmer, if you don't you get no dinner.

===Counting rhymes===
Most rhymes are intended to count the number of jumps the skipper takes without stumbling. These were essentially restricted to times when there were relatively few jumpers and time was abundant. These rhymes can take very simple forms.

This chant was collected in [[London]] in the 1950s:
:[[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] strikes one,{{citation needed||reason=sounds too long to say while turning/jumping|date=May 2014}}
:Big Ben strikes two,
:Big Ben strikes three,
:(etc.)

and

:Applesauce, mustard, cider&lt;ref&gt;"[http://research.udmercy.edu/find/special_collections/digital/cfa/index.php?term=HOME&amp;field=loc_text&amp;start=1000 Search results for 'home']" in ''The James T. Callow Folklore Archive'', at ''Research.UDMercy.edu''. Accessed: December 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
:How many legs has a spider?
:1, 2, 3, etc.

alternately, "Salt, vinegar, mustard, pepper. How many legs does a spider have? 1,2,3, etc."

:Had a little sports car, two-forty-eight,
:Ran around the cor-(''skipper jumps out, and turners continue the syllable until they reenter'')-ner
:and slammed on the brakes, but the brakes didn't work,
:So I bumped into a lady who bumped into a man,
:Who bumped into a police car, man, oh man!
:Policeman caught me and put me in jail,
:All I had was ginger ale
:How many bottles did I drink?
:10! 20! 30! 40! ...(increases by 10 for each successful jump)

:Butterfly, butterfly: turn around. [jumper turns while jumping]&lt;ref name="mudcat.org"&gt;"[http://mudcat.org/jumprope/jumprope_display_all.cfm All Jump Rope Rhymes]", ''Mudcat.org''. Accessed: December 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Butterfly, butterfly: touch the ground [jumper touches the ground as she is jumping]
:Butterfly, butterfly: show your shoe. [..thrusts out her shoe]
:Butterfly, butterfly: [n] to do.
:One, two, three, ...   [up to the count of n, which increases by 1 with each set of jumpers]
Another rendition substitutes, "[[teddy bear]]" for "butterfly. This can be dated no earlier than the early 20th century, to the term of [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://playgroundjungle.com/2009/12/teddy-bear-teddy-bear-the-long-history-of-a-jump-rope-rhyme.html |title=Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear: The Long History of a Jump Rope Rhyme |accessdate=November 2, 2016 |author=Adam Selzer |date=December 17, 2009 |publisher=''PlaygroundJungle.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another skipping rhyme, once the alphabet finishes, participants continue with numbers until skipper catches rope. It is natural for participants to use the letter that the skipper lost on and to use it to find someone's name following the rule of either best friend or boyfriend, depending on what is chosen in the beginning.
:Ice cream, Soda pop, cherry on top,
:Who's your best friend, let's find out;
:Goes A! B! C!
or

:Ice cream soda, cherry on top
:Who's your boyfriend/girlfriend, I forgot;
:Is it an A! B! C!
or

:Ice cream sundae, banana split
:[Name of jumper]'s got a boyfriend/girlfriend,
:Who is it?
:A! B! C!
or

:Ice cream soda, [[Delaware Punch]],
:Tell me the name of my honey-bunch.
:A, B, C, etc.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Another counting rhyme:
:Cinderella dressed in yellow, went upstairs (or downstairs) to kiss her fellow, by mistake kissed a snake, how many doctors will it take? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 etc. (Go to 20 then go down to the next line)
:Cinderella dressed in blue, went upstairs to tie her shoe, made a mistake and tied a knot, how many knots will she make? 1, 2, 3, etc.
:Cinderella dressed in green, went downtown to buy a ring, made a mistake and bought a fake, how many days before it breaks? 1, 2, 3, etc.
:Cinderella dressed in lace, went upstairs to fix her face, oh no oh no, she found a blemish, how many powder puffs till she's finished? 1, 2, 3, etc.
:Cinderella dressed in silk, went outside to get some milk, made a mistake and fell in the lake, how many more till she gets a break? 1, 2, 3, etc.
 
The counting continues as long as the jumper avoids faulting. If they do then the counting starts again.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The British Library|title=Skipping games - Cinderella, dressed in yellow|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/playground/browseadultview.html#cm=Videos&amp;gm=Skipping&amp;id=120554&amp;id2=121109|work=Playtimes|publisher=The British Library (''BL.uk'')|accessdate=3 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021143318/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/playground/browseadultview.html#cm=Videos&amp;gm=Skipping&amp;id=120554&amp;id2=121109|archivedate=21 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous===
*Skipping rhymes need not always have to be rhymes, however. They can be games, such as a game called, "School." In "Kindergarten" (the first round), all skippers must run through rope without skipping. In "First Grade", all skippers must skip in, skip once, and skip out without getting caught in the rope, and so on. Also, there is "Mouse Trap", where there is a special pattern, and players must run through rope without getting caught. If caught, the jumper caught must hold the rope.

[[File:Chinese jump rope Diamonds pattern.svg|thumb|"Diamonds" pattern (the letters spelling "Diamond" are chanted)&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Gayle L. (2009). ''International Games: Building Skills Through Multicultural Play'', p.70. Human Kinetics. {{ISBN|9780736073943}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Chinese jump rope]] patterns are often accompanied by chants. The diamonds pattern is accompanied by the letters which spell "diamond" ("D-I-A-M-O-N-D-S."), while the Americans pattern, as are many patterns, is accompanied by the names of the moves made while carrying out the pattern ("right, left, right, left, in, out/open, in, on.").

===Speed rhymes===
Some rhymes are intended to test the agility of the jumper by turning the rope more rapidly. The key word to start turning fast is often "pepper" to indicate speed, such as:

:Mable, Mable,
:Set the table,
:Don't forget the salt,
:Vinegar,
:Mustard,
:Pepper!  (rapid turning follows)&lt;ref name="mudcat.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Ray. "[http://members.iinet.net.au/~murrayoliver/olivers/games.html The Games]", ''The History of the Olivers of Broken Hill''. Accessed: December 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

*When "RED HOT PEPPERS" was called, the turners would turn the rope as fast as they could.

===Pretty Little Dutch Girl===
 {{main|Pretty Little Dutch Girl}}

"Pretty Little Dutch Girl" was a lengthy song, much too long for a simple chant, but often excerpted for jumping rope. "My husband's name is Fatty. He comes from Cincinnati." Or alphabetical, "My husband's name is Alfred, He comes from Atlanta, He works in the attic.." All made up on the spur of the moment. The jumper may be obliged to jump out upon finishing a letter, or be allowed to continue until either failing to invent new lyrics, or faulting.

===Historical rhymes===
Other rhymes are highly topical, and sometimes survive long after the events that inspired them have disappeared from the headlines. Perhaps the most notorious rhyme of this type is one that began circulating during the 1892 trial of [[Lizzie Borden]]. Despite Lizzie's desire to stay out of the public eye, children would follow her around and chant the rhyme. It later started being used as a rhyme used when skipping-rope:

:Lizzie Borden took an axe
:She gave her mother forty whacks,
:After she saw what she had done,
:She gave her father forty-one.
:Lizzie Borden got away,
:For her crime she did not pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*Variations of this following rhyme, a [[wikt:wordplay|wordplay]] on "influenza," were heard around the time of the [[1918 flu pandemic]]:
:I had a little bird,
:And its name was Enza.
:I opened the window

:There's a big fat policeman by the door, door, door.
:He grabs you by the collar,
:And makes you pay a dollar.
:No, I won't go to Casey's any more.

===Culturally insensitive rhymes===
Children were often the first to notice differences between people and comment on them. Various chants reflect the lack of association with other cultures up until the 1960s or so; such as:

:My parents have pretty eyes{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
:My mother's [[China|Chinese]]
:My father's [[Japan]]ese
:My brother's [[Taiwan]]ese
:My sister's [[Vietnam]]ese

[[Image:stewart-perowne-writer.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart Perowne]]
'''Stewart Henry Perowne''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Venerable Order of Saint John|KStJ]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (17 June 1901 – 10 May 1989) was a British diplomat, archaeologist, explorer and historian who wrote books on the history and antiquities of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Despite his [[homosexuality]], in 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer [[Freya Stark]]. The marriage was dissolved in 1952.

==Early life==
Born in [[Hallow, Worcestershire]], into a distinguished ecclesiastical family, Stewart Perowne was the grandson of [[John Perowne]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]], and the son of Helena Frances (née Oldnall-Russell) (1869–1922) and [[Arthur William Thomson Perowne]], who was the first [[Bishop of Bradford (diocese)|Bishop of Bradford]] and subsequently also [[Bishop of Worcester]]. His older brother was Francis Edward Perowne (1898–1988). His younger brother, Leslie Arthur Perowne (1906–1997), was Head of Music at the [[BBC]] and was responsible for bringing [[Albert Ketèlbey]] out of retirement to conduct a huge BBC Ketèlbey Concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] prior to [[World War II]].

Perowne was educated at [[Haileybury College]], where he was a champion sprinter, and at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where he studied Classical Archaeology and Architecture&lt;ref&gt;.[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUOvl9E3DRcC&amp;pg=PA295 Geniesse, Jane Fletcher ''Freya Stark Passionate Nomad'' Random House, Inc (2000) (p. 328) ''[[Google Books]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he gained a graduate degree in Classics. He went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1927 under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], as Head of Education in the Palestine Government Education Service, teaching at the [[Anglican]] St George's School in [[Jerusalem]]. He became fluent in spoken and written [[Arabic]]. In 1930 Perowne transferred to the administrative branch of the Palestine Government, working for a time as Assistant District Commissioner for [[Galilee]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;E. C. Hodgkin, 'Perowne, Stewart Henry (1901–1989)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]] (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57383, accessed 26 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 he was appointed an Officer of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33728/pages/4072 Perowne in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' 23 June 1931 (p. 4072)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic career==
[[Image:stark-perowne-1947.jpg|thumb|right|Perowne and [[Freya Stark]] on their wedding day in 1947]]
He later served in Malta, Aden, Iraq, Barbados, Libya and Israel.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/16/obituaries/stewart-perowne-87-diplomat-and-author.html Perowne's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 16 May 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[King George VI Coronation Medal|Coronation Medal]] in 1937. In 1938 Perowne worked for the [[BBC]], preparing talks and features for transmission by the overseas Arabic service. In the same year he deposited a collection of [[potsherd]]s with the [[British Museum]], most of which are of [[Bronze Age]] type and probably derive from the ancient site of Subr.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; In 1939 he was appointed Public Information Officer in Aden, where he developed a passion for archaeology, and where he discovered the seventh century BC sites of Imadiya and [[Beihan]].&lt;ref&gt;Perowne, Stewart 'Im'adiya and Beihan, Aden Protectorate', ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' No. 13 (1939), pp. 133–37)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 Perowne was appointed Public Relations Officer to the British embassy in [[Baghdad]]. In 1944 he succeeded the scholar [[Vyvyan Holt]] as oriental counsellor.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

During his diplomatic postings he designed stamps for [[Malta]] (1936), the [[Aden Protectorate]] (1938), [[Barbados]] (1949), [[Libya]] (1951), and currency notes for the [[West Indies Federation]] (1949) and Libya (1951).&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;

==Marriage==
Because of his career as a diplomat it was expected that Perowne should marry. As a homosexual he decided to embark on a [[mariage blanc]], and on 7 October 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer [[Freya Stark]] at St Margaret's church in [[Westminster]]. She was his senior by eight years and had been his assistant in [[Yemen]] when he was Information Officer. Stark's biographer has argued that she may not have known of Perowne's homosexuality, and of his taste for men in uniform.&lt;ref&gt;M. Izzard, Freya Stark: a biography (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geniesse, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/05/biography2 'Travelling tales of a reluctant virgin' ''[[The Observer]]'' 5 December 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1947 people's sexual proclivities were still part of their private lives and … no one among Freya's friends seemed able to warn her of the pitfalls of marriage to a homosexual."&lt;ref&gt;Izzard, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Confused as to why Perowne would not sleep with her, she wrote to him, "I think you have left something lying between us, untold. Whatever it is, it will not make me think less of you or care less for you." Eventually, after skirting around the subject, he wrote to her:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is difficult to say what "normal" is – my friend a counsellor of St. George's Hospital always refuses to use the word and in both men and women, you have a wide and graded range from ultra-male to ultra-female with naturally most people in the middle ranges ... Now for myself, I put myself in the middle group. I have ordinary male abilities. I like male sports some of them, and I love the company of women. In fact, I find it hard to exist without it. At the same time, I am occasionally attracted by members of my own sex – generally. For some even pleasurable reason – by wearers of uniform.&lt;ref&gt;Geniesse, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite their similar interests the marriage could not survive and they divorced in 1952. There were no children.

==Later years==
In 1947 Perowne was appointed Colonial Secretary to [[Barbados]] where he was a member of the island's Legislative Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/38176/pages/273 Perowne in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' (p. 273)]&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming political adviser in [[Cyrenaica]] from 1950 to 1951. Here he discovered the ancient city-site of Aziris.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; Taking early retirement in 1951, after his divorce in 1952 he returned to Palestine, now the State of Israel, where he assisted [[Weston Henry Stewart]], the [[Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem]] in designing and organising model villages for [[Palestinian Arabs]] who had been made refugees as a result of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He was an Adviser to the UK delegation to the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN Assembly]] in Paris in November 1951.&lt;ref name=BM&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?searchTerm=henri&amp;orig=/research/search_the_collection_database/search_results_provenance.aspx&amp;personId=22639&amp;personAssociation=&amp;termDisplay=Perowne,+Stewart+Henry Perowne on the [[British Museum]] Collection Database]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he also began to write, his first book being ''Jerusalem, The One Remains'' (1954). Later books included ''The Life and Times of Herod the Great'' (1958), ''The Later Herods'' (1958), ''Hadrian'' (1960), ''Caesars and Saints'' (1962), ''The End of the Roman World'' (1966), and ''The Death of the Roman Republic'' (1969). Other books among the 18 he wrote include guides to Athens, Jerusalem, Rome and Malta. In addition, he was a frequent contributor to various edited works, encyclopaedias and academic journals, including ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]''.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; Perowne was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1944 and a Knight of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]] (KStJ) in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/40378/supplements/158 Perowne in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' 7 January 1955 (p. 158)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 he was named Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] (FSA). He was a Member of the Church of England Foreign Relations Council.

Perowne died in 1989 at [[Charing Cross Hospital]] in London aged 87 years old.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He was survived by his former wife, [[Freya Stark]].

The '''Surrey Theatre''', London  began life in 1782 as the '''Royal Circus and Equestrian Philharmonic Academy''', one of the many circuses that provided contemporary London entertainment of both horsemanship and drama.  It stood in [[Blackfriars Road]], near the junction with [[Westminster Bridge Road]], in the [[London Borough of Southwark]].

==History==
The ''Royal Circus'' was opened on 4 November 1782 by the composer and song writer, [[Charles Dibdin]] (who coined the word "circus"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080107121735/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/circus_tour/the_first_circus/default.php ''Mr Philip Astley’s Introduction to The First Circus in England'' (PeoplePlay UK)] accessed 18 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt; aided by Charles Hughes, a well-known equestrian performer.  The entertainments were at first performed by children with the goal of its being a nursery for young actors.  Delphini, a celebrated [[buffo]], became manager in 1788 and  produced a spectacle including a real stag-hunt.  Other animal acts followed, including the popular dog act ''Gelert and Victor'', lecture pieces, [[pantomime]]s and local spectacles.  The popular comedian John Palmer then managed the theatre until 1789,&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;Walford, pp. 368-83&lt;/ref&gt; when he was committed to [[Horsemonger Lane Gaol]] as "a rogue and a vagabond".&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/surrey.htm ''The Royal Circus and Surrey Theatre''] (Arthur Lloyd theatre history), accessed 10 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It continued in use until 1810, although it had a troubled existence, being burnt down in 1799 and again on 12 August 1805. Rebuilt in 1806 by the German architect of the [[Old Vic]], [[Rudolph Cabanel]], it was converted into a theatre by [[Robert William Elliston|Robert Elliston]].  He renamed it the Surrey Theatre, being determined to perform [[Shakespeare]] and other plays.  He reopened on [[Easter Monday]] and to avoid trouble with the law, which did not allow dialogue to be spoken without musical accompaniment except at the two [[patent theatre]]s, he put a ballet into every such production, including ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', and [[George Farquhar|Farquhar]]'s ''[[The Beaux' Stratagem]]''. Contemporary reviewers noted that the Lambeth streets teemed with prostitutes.&lt;ref name=garden&gt;[http://www.compulink.co.uk/~museumgh/local%20history%20C ''The Railway Age'' Museum of Garden History (Lambeth Local History)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926214808/http://www.compulink.co.uk/~museumgh/local%20history%20C |date=26 September 2007 }} accessed 18 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Elliston left in 1814, and the Surrey became a circus again until [[Thomas John Dibdin|Thomas Dibdin]] reopened it as a theatre in 1816.  The arena where the equestrian exercises had been displayed was converted into a large pit for spectators, and the stables became saloons.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;  [[Fanny Fitzwilliam]] and Sally Brook starred in [[melodrama]]s, but the theatre had little success overall. [[John Baldwin Buckstone]] made his first London appearance at the theatre, on 30 January 1823, as Ramsay in ''[[The Fortunes of Nigel]]''.  [[George Holland]] also appeared at the theatre, in 1826.

When Elliston returned in 1827, the theatre's fortunes changed.  In 1829, [[Douglas William Jerrold|Douglas Jerrold]]'s melodrama ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', with T. P. Cooke as ''William'', the nautical hero, ran for over 300 nights, which was extraordinarily successful for the time.  Elliston made his last appearance at this theatre on 24 June 1831, twelve days before he died. Osbaldiston then took over and, among other plays, produced [[Edward Fitzball]]'s ''Jonathan Bradford; or, the Murder at the Roadside Inn'', which ran for 260 nights.  Productions of [[Dickens]] dramas, among others, followed.  [[Ira Aldridge]], the first successful black actor, appeared here in the 1840s.&lt;ref name=garden/&gt;  C. Z. Barnett's adaptation, ''A Christmas Carol; or, The Miser's Warning'' played in 1844.  Richard Shepherd, who succeeded [[Alfred Bunn]] in 1848, remained at the theatre until 1869 and established its reputation for 'rough-and-tumble' transpontine melodrama.

On 29 January 1865, during the last scene of the [[pantomime]] ''Richard Coeur de Lion'', a fire began above the [[chandelier]]. The audience evacuated safely, but before the cast could leave the entire theatre was plunged into darkness, as the gas supervisor cut the gas supply to prevent an explosion. Panic ensued backstage, but the cast were led to safety through the burning scenery by the efforts of Green (acting manager), Rowella (the 'clown'), Evans (the 'pantaloon'), Vivian (the 'sprite') and others. The cast, still in their flimsy stage clothes, were conveyed to their lodgings in a fleet of cabs, provided by the police. In less than ten minutes the interior was ablaze, and the theatre was burnt down shortly after midnight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1865/02/19/78739788.pdf "The Surrey Theatre: Its total destruction by fire",] ''London News'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', 30 January 1865, accessed 10 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new theatre, designed by John Ellis, seating 2,161 people in four tiers, opened on 26 December 1865.  Little of note took place until 1881, when [[George Augustus Conquest|George Conquest]] took over, staging melodramas, many of them written by himself, and [[pantomime]]s.&lt;ref name="Law2013"&gt;"Conquest family" in {{cite book|author=Jonathan Law (Ed.)|title=The Methuen Drama Dictionary of the Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tb-OAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=978-1-4081-3148-0|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surrey flourished until his death in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000287/19010515/098/0003 The Shields Daily Gazette and Shipping Telegraph]'', 15 May 1901, p. 3. [[British Newspaper Archive]]. Retrieved 12 September 2015. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was remodelled by Kirk and Kirk, as a [[music hall]], but did not prosper, becoming a cinema in 1920. It finally closed in 1924, and the building was demolished in 1934. The site is now occupied by modern flats.

[[File:Susanne-rottenbacher-im-atelier2013.jpg|thumb|The artist at her studio, 2013]]
'''Susanne Rottenbacher''' (born 11 July 1969) is a German artist primarily concerned with light, color and installation.

== Life and work ==
[[File:Frei 08.jpg|thumb|right|Installation "Freiheit!", Christuskirche, Cologne, 2012]]
[[File:Shinealight01.jpg|thumb|right|Installation "Shine A Light", showroom Manske, Berlin, 2013]]
[[File:Talk-talk05.jpg|thumb|right|Installation "Talk, Talk", Berlin, 2014]]
Rottenbacher was born in [[Göttingen]] and is now based in Berlin. The artist enrolled at [[Columbia University]], Barnard College, New York, in 1988. After graduating in 1991 (B.A., scenography / theatre) she attended the [[Bartlett School of Architecture|Bartlett School of Architecture and Planning]] in London to study light and lighting design (M.Sc.,1992).
 
Rottenbacher creates spacious installations assembled from individual sculptural elements best to be described as light-colour corpuses. They are made of perspex constructs equipped on their inside with LED lights and painted on their outside with dynamic stripe-patterns. Suspended from the ceiling by strands of wire, the sculptures seem to be floating in space. Others are placed on the ground, either free standing or simply laid down. Truncated forms seem to merge into the architecture, apparently progressing into walls and floors. All such elements may be presented individually or pooled to form larger ensembles that function as site-specific intenventions.
 
In Rottenbacher's sculptures, the coloured light firstly correlates with the stripe-painting and the form of the perspex corpus. It then als interacts vividly with the specific light dynamic of the surrounding space creating a form of a continuous dialogue. Given a strong surrounding light, colour and form seem to be very much focussed on the sculpture´s specific form. With decreasing daylight, the work increasingly radiates into the space in an occupying manner. Changing daylight allows for a spectacle of great poetic power to occur, showcasing the sculpture as its bright and shining "hero".
 
Although she creates massive sculptural bodies and spacious installations, Rottenbacher's sculptures are generally characterized by particular lightness and transparency. Often enough these playfully enter into an exciting and ironic tribute playing dialogue with the works of some of the most prolific sculptors of the 20th century. (text: Rafael von Uslar)

'''''The Bloody Chamber''''' (or '''''The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories''''') is a collection of [[Short story|short fiction]] by English writer [[Angela Carter]]. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 1979 by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/angela-carter/bloody-chamber.htm | publisher = Fantastic Fiction | place = UK | title = Angela Carter | chapter = Bloody Chamber}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and won the [[Cheltenham Prize for Literature|Cheltenham Festival Literary Prize]]. The stories share a theme of being closely based upon [[Fairy tale|fairytales]] or [[Folklore|folk tales]]. However, Carter has stated:

{{quote |
My intention was not to do 'versions' or, as the American edition of the book said, horribly, 'adult' fairy tales, but to extract the latent content from the traditional stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | chapter = Angela Carter | first = John | last = Haffenden | title = Novelists in Interview | place = New York | publisher = Methuen Press | year = 1985 | page = 80 | ISBN = 978-0-416-37600-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthology contains ten stories: "The Bloody Chamber", "The Courtship of Mr Lyon", "The Tiger's Bride", "Puss-in-Boots", "The Erl-King", "The Snow Child", "The Lady of the House of Love", "The Werewolf", "The Company of Wolves" and "Wolf-Alice".

The tales vary greatly in length, with the [[Novella|novelette]] "The Bloody Chamber" being "more than twice the length of any of the other stories, and more than thirty times the length of the shortest [the [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] "The Snow Child"]."&lt;ref name = "Simpson"&gt;{{citation | first = Helen | last = Simpson | chapter = Introduction | title = The Bloody Chamber | place = London | publisher = Vintage | origyear = 1979 | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |viii}}

The anthology's contents are also reprinted in Carter's ''[[Burning Your Boats]]''.

==Story summaries==
The stories within "The Bloody Chamber" are explicitly based on fairy tales. Carter was no doubt inspired by the works of author and fairytale collector [[Charles Perrault]], whose fairy tales she had translated shortly beforehand.

===The Bloody Chamber===
(based on "[[Bluebeard]]")

The narrator, a beautiful teenage girl, marries an older, wealthy French Marquis, whom she does not love. When he takes her to his castle, she discovers his collection of pornographic images and takes pleasure in her embarrassment. She is a talented pianist, and a young man, a blind piano tuner from the local town, hears her music, he falls in love with her. The narrator's husband tells her that he must leave on a business trip to New York and provides her with a chain of keys. However, he forbids her to enter one particular room while he is away. When he leaves she feels melancholy and telephones her mother. Afterwards, she starts going through the Marquis's things in order to learn more about him. She enters the forbidden room in his absence and realizes the full extent of his perverse and murderous tendencies when she discovers the bodies of his previous wives. She confides the newly discovered secret to the piano tuner when suddenly the Marquis returns home for his business trip was canceled. He discovers that she has entered the room and proceeds to try to add her to his collection of corpses through beheading. The brave piano tuner is willing to stay with her even though he knows he will not be able to save her. She is saved at the last moment at the end of the story by her mother, who bursts into the mansion and shoots the Marquis just as he is about to murder the girl. The girl, her mother and the piano tuner go on to live together and the young widow opens a little music school on the outskirts of Paris. Most of the money she inherited is given away to various charities and the castle is turned into a school for the blind.

===The Courtship of Mr Lyon===
(based on'' [[Beauty and the Beast]]'' — the concept of the Beast as a lion-like figure is a popular one, most notably in the [[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|French film version of 1946]])

Beauty's father, after experiencing car trouble, takes advantage of a stranger's hospitality. However, his benefactor – the Beast – takes umbrage when he steals a miraculous white rose for his beloved daughter. Beauty becomes the guest of the [[lion|leonine]] Beast, and the Beast aids her father in getting his fortune back. Beauty later joins her father in London, where she almost forgets the Beast, causing him to wither away from heartache. When Beauty learns that he is dying, she returns, saving him. Beauty and the Beast disclose their love for one another and the Beast's humanity is revealed. They live happily ever after.

===The Tiger's Bride===
(also based on ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'')

A woman moves in with a mysterious, masked "Milord", the Beast, after her father loses her to him in a game of cards. Milord is eventually revealed to be a tiger. In a reversal of the ending of "The Courtship of Mr Lyon", the heroine transforms at the end into a glorious tiger who is the proper mate to the Beast, who will from now on be true to his own nature and not disguise himself as a human.

===Puss-in-Boots===
(based on "[[Puss in Boots]]" and similar to The Barber of Seville)

Figaro, a cat, moves in with a rakish young man who lives a happily debauched life. They live a carefree existence, with the cat helping him to make money by cheating at cards, until the young man actually falls in love (to the cat's disgust) with a young woman kept in a tower by a miserly, older husband who treats her only as property. The cat, hoping his friend will tire of the woman if he has her, helps the young man into the bed of his sweetheart by playing tricks on the old husband and the young woman's keeper. Figaro himself finds love with the young woman's cat, and the two cats arrange the fortunes of both themselves and the young man and woman by arranging to trip the old man so that he will fall to his death.

Angela Carter had described Puss in Boots as “the Cat as Con Man... a masterpiece of cynicism... a Figaroesque valet – a servant so much the master already”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Angela Carter|journal = New Society|title = The Better to Eat You With|date = 22 July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Erl-King===
(an adaptation of the [[Erlking]] in folklore; a sort of goblin or spirit of the woodlands)

A maiden wanders into the woods and is seduced by the sinister Erl-King, a seeming [[personification]] of the forest itself. However, she eventually realises that he plans to imprison her by turning her into a bird, which he has done with other girls. Realising the Erl-King's plan, she kills him by strangling him with his own hair, thus keeping her freedom.

===The Snow Child===
(has roots in various folktales, most apparently ''[[The Snow-child]]'', particularly in its variant [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/snow.html The Snow, the Crow, and the Blood], but also in tales such as [[Snegurochka]] and an obscure variant of [[Snow White]].&lt;ref name = "Simpson" /&gt;{{rp |xvi}})

A Count and Countess go riding in midwinter. The Count sees snow on the ground and wishes for a child "as white as snow". Similar wishes are made when the Count sees a hole in the snow containing a pool of blood, and a raven. As soon as he made his final wish a young woman of the exact description appears at the side of the road. The Count pays immediate attention to her, much to the chagrin of the Countess. At the Countess' command, the girl picks a rose but is pricked by a thorn and dies, after which the Count [[necrophilia|rapes her corpse]]. After this, her cadaver melts into the snow, leaving nothing but a bloodstain on the snow, a black feather and the rose that she had picked.

===The Lady of the House of Love===
(based loosely on ''[[Sleeping Beauty]] ''and more directly on a radio play called "Vampirella")

A virginal English soldier, travelling through Romania by bicycle, finds himself in a deserted village. He comes across a mansion inhabited by a vampire who survives by enticing young men into her bedroom and feeding on them. She intends to feed on the young soldier but his purity and virginity have a curious effect on her. When they enter her bedroom she accidentally cuts herself and the soldier kisses it better. He wakes up to find her dead. He leaves to return to his battalion and is assumed to be killed in [[World War I]].

===The Werewolf===
(based on "[[Little Red Riding Hood]]")

A girl goes to visit her grandmother, but encounters a werewolf on the way, whose paw she cuts off with a knife. When she reaches her grandmother's house, the paw has turned into a hand with the grandmother's ring on it, and the grandmother is both delirious and missing her hand. This reveals the girl's grandmother as the werewolf, and she is stoned to death. The girl then inherits all of her grandmother's possessions.

A closer look into the story might suggest that in fact the girl had set up her grandmother through a set of convenient lies, in order to gain her inheritance. For example, the snow covering any evidence of a struggle with the wolf.

===The Company of Wolves===
(closer adaptation of "[[Little Red Riding Hood]]")

"Those are the voices of my brothers, darling; I love the company of wolves."

In the beginning of the piece, the wolf is described as an evil thing. One mini story in the beginning is about a witch who turned a whole wedding ceremony into wolves. She likes them coming to her cabin and howling their misery for it soothes her. In another mini story a young lady and a man are about to have sex on their wedding night. As they get ready the husband says he needs to stop and relieve himself in the forest. The wife waits and he never returns. Off in the distance a wolf can be heard howling. She then figures her husband will never return and marries a new man. With her new husband she bears children. Her first husband comes back and sees his wife. The first husband then becomes furious and bites the leg off the eldest child. Her second husband kills the wolf, who dies and looks exactly the same as he had when he disappeared; this makes her cry and her husband beats her. Later we meet a girl walking in the woods. She was loved by everyone and feared nothing. She meets a handsome hunter who makes a deal with her; whoever can get to the grandmother's house first wins, and if the hunter wins she owes him a kiss. She lets the hunter win because she wants to kiss him. The hunter arrives at the grandmother's house tricking her. She is frail and sick. She holds a Bible in her hand for protection. He eats the grandmother, then waits for the girl. When she arrives, she notices her grandmother's hair in the fire and knows the wolf has killed her. He threatens to kill and eat her too, but she laughs in his face and proceeds to seduce him, stripping off their clothes and throwing them into the fire. The last lines are "See! sweet and sound she sleeps in granny's bed, between the paws of the tender wolf."

===Wolf-Alice===
(based on an obscure variant of "Little Red Riding Hood"&lt;ref name = "Simpson" /&gt;{{rp |xviii}} and with reference to ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'', this tale explores the journey towards [[subjectivity]] and [[self-awareness]] from the perspective of a [[feral child]])

A feral child, whom some nuns have attempted to "civilize" by trying to teach her standard social graces, is left in the house of a monstrous, vampiric Duke when she cannot conform. She gradually comes to realise her own identity as a young woman and human being, and even develops compassion for the Duke, going far beyond the nuns' stunted views of life.

==Style and themes==
Angela Carter's short stories challenge the way women are represented in [[fairy tales]], yet retain an air of tradition and convention through her voluptuously descriptive prose. For example, in the opening tale "The Bloody Chamber" which is a retelling of [[Bluebeard]], Carter plays with the conventions of canonical [[fairy tales]]; instead of the heroine being rescued by the stereotypical male hero, she is rescued by her mother.

Carter effectively draws out the theme of feminism by contrasting traditional elements of [[Gothic fiction]] – which usually depicted female characters as weak and helpless – with strong female protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t113.e3192&amp;srn=7&amp;ssid=653828403#FIRSTHIT "Gothic Fiction."] ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'' n.d.: n.pag. Web. 23 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrasting the barren and horrific atmosphere found typically within the Gothic to the strong heroines of her story, Carter is able to create sexually liberated female characters that are set against the more traditional backdrop of the fairy tale. In doing so, Carter reinvents the outdated conventions of fairy tales and offers insight on the archetypes and stereotypes of women in these well-known and celebrated stories. It is notable that the conventions Carter analyzes and reimagines  are of a patriarchal nature. Many of the original fairy tales that she draws inspiration from illustrate female characters in a vulnerable, damsel-in-distress position. It is clear that in giving her female characters more agency, Carter is directly responding to and critiquing these traditional patriarchal tropes. 

The stories deal with themes of women's roles in relationships and marriage, their sexuality, coming of age and corruption. Stories such as "The Bloody Chamber" and "The Company of Wolves" explicitly deal with the horrific or corrupting aspects of marriage and/or sex and the balance of power within such relationships. Themes of female identity are explored in the "Beauty and the Beast" stories such as "The Tiger's Bride". In one instance, Beauty: the story's heroine, is described as removing the petals from a white rose as her father gambles her away, a seeming representation of the stripping away of the false layers of her personality to find her true identity; an image that finds a mirror in the story's fantastical conclusion.

As a whole, ''The Bloody Chamber'' can be treated as a collection of short stories that speak to a bigger narrative that deals with issues of feminism and metamorphosis instead of a set of individual tales. Although each particular narrative deals with a different set of characters, the 'oppressed female seeking liberation' is a common theme and concept that is explored throughout the collection. The characters seem to blend into each other and become indistinguishable from one another when recognising this theme in the text.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Sarah. ''The Fiction of Angela Carter''. Cambridge: Icon Books Ltd., 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The time periods of the stories remain vague.  For example, in "The Bloody Chamber" the [[Timeline of the telephone|existence of a transatlantic telephone]] implies a date of 1930 or later. On the other hand, the mention of painters such as [[Gustave Moreau]] and [[Odilon Redon]], and of fashion designer [[Paul Poiret]] (who designs one of the heroine's gowns) all suggest a date before 1945. "The Lady of the House of Love" is clearly set on the eve of the First World War, and the young man's bicycle on which he arrives at the tradition-bound vampire's house is a symbol of the encroaching modernity which fundamentally altered European society after 1914.

==Reception==

===Awards===
''The Bloody Chamber'' won the Cheltenham Festival Literary Prize in 1979.

===Critical reception===
''The Bloody Chamber'' has received heavy praise and attention from numerous critics such as [[Jack Zipes]] (who called it a "remarkable collection"&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, "Crossing Boundaries with Wise Girls: Angela Carter's Fairy Tales for Children" in ''Angela Carter and the Fairy Tale'', ed. Danielle M. Roemer and Christina Bacchilega (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998), p 159.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Marina Warner]] (who, on its inspirational nature, said it "turned the key for [her] as a writer"&lt;ref&gt;Marina Warner, "Ballerina: The Belled Girl Sends a Tape to an Impresario" in ''Angela Carter and the Fairy Tale'', ed. Danielle M. Roemer and Christina Bacchilega (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998), p 250.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Several critical works have been published that focus on Carter's use of fairy tales in ''The Bloody Chamber'' and her other works&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Angela Carter and the Fairy Tale'', ed. Danielle M. Roemer and Christina Bacchilega (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and the anthology is also frequently taught and studied in University literature courses.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{citation | publisher = [[Simon Fraser University]] | url = https://www.sfu.ca/gls/819-077.htm | place = CA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090211173703/http://www.sfu.ca/gls/819-077.htm | archivedate = 11 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}; {{citation | publisher=[[University of Essex]] | place=UK | url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/literature/ug/course_outlines/lt363-3-fy.htm | title=Course outline | accessdate=15 May 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130549/http://www.essex.ac.uk/literature/ug/course_outlines/lt363-3-fy.htm | archivedate=29 September 2007 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been used as part of the [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] [[English Literature]], the OCR English Literature and Edexcel English Language/Literature syllabus for [[A-Levels]] in some schools in the United Kingdom.

[[Neil Gaiman]] cited the book as one of his inspirations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bustle.com/articles/154260-neil-gaiman-lists-28-of-his-female-inspirations-and-you-need-to-add-them-all&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic ''[[Patricia Duncker]]'', however, was more reserved in her praise, criticising it for not breaking enough taboos. She said 'Carter could never have imagined Cinderella in bed with the fairy God-mother.'&lt;ref&gt; https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/24/classics.angelacarter&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Radio===
Carter later adapted "The Company of Wolves" and "Puss-in-Boots" into radio plays which were broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1980 and 1982 respectively. The 1982 adaptation of "Puss in Boots" (as it was retitled) starred [[Andrew Sachs]] in the title role.&lt;ref name="a Bell"&gt;Mark Bell (ed.), production notes to Angela Carter's ''[[The Curious Room]]'' (London: Vintage, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The scripts for both of these plays were published in Carter's ''Come Unto These Yellow Sands'' and later the [[List of works published posthumously|posthumous]] collection ''[[The Curious Room]]'', which also included production notes.

===Film===
The 1984 film ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' by [[Neil Jordan]] was based upon the werewolf stories in this collection, in particular the Little Red Riding Hood analogue "The Company of Wolves". Carter also directly contributed to the screenplay of this film, which bears close resemblance to her 1980 radio play adaptation of "The Company of Wolves." Carter's original screenplay for this film is published in ''[[The Curious Room]]''. Jordan and Carter also discussed producing a film adaptation of "Vampirella", the radio drama that became "The Lady of the House of Love", but this project was never released.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Jordan quoted in the production notes to Angela Carter's The Curious Room (London: Vintage, 1997), p 507.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music video===
[[Punk rock|Punk]] band [[Daisy Chainsaw]] adapted the story of "The Lady of the House of Love" for their 1992 music video for "Hope Your Dreams Come True" (from the [[Extended play|EP]] of the same name and also later the album ''[[Eleventeen (Daisy Chainsaw album)|Eleventeen]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbMQFvW2CEg | title = YouTube | publisher = Google}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
The stories within ''The Bloody Chamber'' are a popular subject for theatrical adaptation. The story "The Bloody Chamber" has been adapted for the theatre more than once, including a performance by the "Zoo District" which was accompanied by an [[amateur film]] adaptation of "Wolf-Alice".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Zoo District | url = http://www.zoodistrict.org/documents/history/bloodychamber.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030822073931/http://www.zoodistrict.org/documents/history/bloodychamber.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2003-08-22 | title = Bloody Chamber }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  "The Company of Wolves" is also a popular subject for adaptation by amateur/student theatre groups (e.g. by a Welsh drama college&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.trinity-cm.ac.uk/english/fac_arts/sch_theatre_s/staff.asp | title=Staff | publisher=Trinity CM | place=Wales, UK | accessdate=29 June 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070436/http://www.trinity-cm.ac.uk/english/fac_arts/sch_theatre_s/staff.asp | archivedate=28 September 2007 | deadurl=yes  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Neil Murray directed a haunting and erotic theatre production of Carter's story 'The Tiger's Bride' in 2001 at the Gulbenkian Studio, Newcastle Playhouse. Murray comments on his interest in Carter's work and refers to her discussion of fairy tales as 'an important medium.'

In August 2013, Melbourne's Malthouse Theatre presented a stage adaptation of The Bloody Chamber by writer [[Van Badham]],  directed by Matthew Lutton, with composers David Chisholm (scoring for three live harps) and Jethro Woodward (live and replayed electronic soundscore). Set and costumedesign were by Anna Cordingley with lighting designer Paul Jackson. Save for a relatively brief appearance by Shelly Lauman, the piece was in essence performed by Alison Whyte. The three harpists were Jacinta Dennett, Jess Fotinos, and Yinuo Mu.

===Music===
The band [[The Parlour Trick]] featured a song called "The Lady of the House of Love" on their 2012 album ''A Blessed Unrest''. Angela Carter is listed as an inspiration in the album notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://theparlourtrick.bandcamp.com/ | title = The Parlour Trick | publisher = Bandcamp}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Wolf Alice]] is a band which named themselves after the story in the anthology.

“'''The Most Incredible Thing'''" ({{lang-da|Det Utroligste}}) is a literary [[fairy tale]] by Danish poet and author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805&amp;ndash;1875). The story is about a contest to find the most incredible thing and the wondrous consequences when the winner is chosen.  The tale was first published in an English translation by [[Horace Scudder]], an American correspondent of Andersen's, in the United States in September 1870 before being published in the original Danish in Denmark in October 1870. "The Most Incredible Thing" was the first of Andersen's tales to be published in Denmark during [[World War II]]. Andersen considered the tale one of his best.&lt;ref name="Tatar"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tatar |first=Maria |title=The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-393-06081-2 |pages=298&amp;ndash;303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
When the tale begins, a contest has been proclaimed in which half the kingdom and the hand of the princess in marriage will be the rewards of he who can produce the most incredible thing. A poor young man creates a magnificent clock with different lifelike figures — [[Moses]], [[Adam and Eve]], the Four [[Season]]s, the Five [[Sense]]s, and others — which appear at the stroke of the hour. All agree the clock is the most incredible thing and its creator is named the winner.  Suddenly, another man smashes the clock and all then agree that this act is even more incredible than the creation of the beautiful clock.  The destroyer is to wed the princess, but at the wedding, the figures of the clock magically reappear, defeat him, and then vanish. All agree that this is the most incredible thing, and the princess and the young creator of the clock marry.

===The figures===
Each hour on the clock is represented by a figure from the Bible, mythology, folklore or common knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;The Most Incredible Thing (1870)|http://hca.gilead.org.il/inkling/most_incredible.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*One o'clock: Moses, writing the first of the ten commandments
*Two o'clock: Adam and Eve
*Three o'clock: The Three Wise Men
*Four o'clock: The Four Seasons, represented by a cuckoo bird (spring), a grasshopper (summer), an empty stork's nest (autumn), and an old crow (winter)
*Five o'clock: The Five Senses, represented by a spectacle maker (sight), a coppersmith (hearing), a flower girl (smell), a cook (taste), and an undertaker (touch)
*Six o'clock: A gambler, who always rolled sixes
*Seven o'clock: The seven days of the week, or the seven deadly sins
*Eight o'clock: A choir of eight singing monks
*Nine o'clock: The Muses of Greek mythology
*Ten o'clock: Moses returns with the rest of the Ten Commandments
*Eleven o'clock: Eleven children played and sang "Two and two and seven, the clock has struck eleven"
*Twelve o'clock: A night watchman announces the birth of Christ

The tale has no counterpart in traditional folk and fairy lore but is entirely original with Andersen.  Its inspiration is ascribed to Andersen’s distress over the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the wars between Denmark and Prussia in the 1860s.  Andersen had been warmly received in Germany and the poet loved German high culture but he was completely shocked by the nation‘s descent into militarism.

[[File:HCAndersen.jpeg|thumb|Andersen in 1867]]
The tale was first published as “The Most Extraordinary Thing” in an English translation by [[Horace Scudder]] in the United States in ''The Riverside Magazine for Young People'' in September 1870. The Danish original appeared in Denmark in the journal ''Nyt Dansk Maanedsskrift'' a month later in October 1870. The tale was reprinted in Denmark on 30 March 1872 and again on 20 December 1874 in collections of Andersen‘s tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=190 |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Most Incredible Thing |accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen enjoyed performing before an audience and promoted many of his tales by reading them aloud at social gatherings.  In the 1840s, the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]] was present at such a reading in Germany and reported he was so elated and excited by the performance that he couldn't wait to thank Andersen but "jubilantly flew" at the poet exclaiming: "But you are a marvelous reader; no one reads fairy tales like you!" Many years later in the 1870s, the English author and critic [[Edmund Gosse]] had a similar perception and noted, "As soon as he spoke, yes, if he merely smiled, he genius was evident ... And as he read, everything I was looking at&amp;mdash;the dazzling sails, the sea, the coast of Sweden, the bright sky&amp;mdash;was set ablaze as the sun went down. It was as if nature itself were blushing with delight at the sound of Hans Christian Andersen's voice."&lt;ref name="JensAndersen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Andersen |first=Jens |title=Hans Christian Andersen: A New Life |publisher=Overlook Duckworth |year=2005 |pages=215&amp;ndash;218 |isbn=1-58567-737-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen managed to read aloud "The Most Incredible Thing" at least seven times within a matter of days.  The readings began before a circle of admirers at the home of the Koch family on the day the tale was finished. Over the next several days, he visited the homes of several others including the Hartmanns, the Collins, the Thieles, and the Melchiors.  Andersen used such readings to gauge the success of his compositions: the louder and longer the audience's applause, the fewer corrections he would make to the tale and the sooner the manuscript reached the publisher's office.&lt;ref name="JensAndersen" /&gt;

==Commentaries==
For fairy tale and folk lore researcher [[Maria Tatar]], the tale summarizes Andersen’s views on the "essence of art" with the clock representing both temporality and transcendence.  It keeps time but it is also a work of art that cannot be destroyed. She notes that the clock houses both "the biblical and the mythical, the seasons and the senses, the visual and the acoustical, the carnal and the spiritual" and thus brings together everything Andersen wanted in art.  The wondrous clock "mingles the secular with the sacred and the pagan with the Christian".  The beauty of the clock and its figurines defy and transcend destruction and continue to live in a way that humans cannot.&lt;ref name="Tatar" /&gt;

==Cultural impact==
"The Most Incredible Thing" was the first Andersen story published during the Nazi [[occupation of Denmark]] during [[World War II]].  The introduction to the July 1940 edition suggested Andersen had written the tale in profound anxiety and doubt over the future that "was superseded with an even more profound faith."  In 1942, the tale was published in a volume of stories organized by scholars who would later become leaders of the [[Danish Resistance]]  Movement. In the tale’s final illustration to the 1942 edition, the night watchman is a bearded rabbi who strikes down the brawny semi-naked Aryan destroyer of the clock while a crowd of Danes in contemporary 1940s dress stands by and watches.&lt;ref name="Nunnally"/&gt;

==Ballet==

In 2011 British pop act [[Pet Shop Boys]] wrote the music for a ballet based on the story that opened in March 2011 at [[Sadler's Wells]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petshopboys.co.uk/news/2601&lt;/ref&gt; The story was adapted by [[Matthew Dunster]] and featured choreography by [[Javier de Frutos]]. It starred former [[Royal Ballet]] principal [[Ivan Putrov]] and animated film created by [[Tal Rosner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sadlerswells.com/show/Pet-Shop-Boys-and-Javier-De-Frutos |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810083140/http://www.sadlerswells.com/show/Pet-Shop-Boys-and-Javier-De-Frutos |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballet won an Evening Standard Theatre Award and returned to Sadlers Wells for a second season in 2012.

In 2016 the [[New York City Ballet]] premiered a one-act ballet based on the same story, choreographed by [[Justin Peck]].&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, Alastair (February 3, 2016).

''New York Times''. Print version appeared February 4, 2016, under title "Forever Mindful of the Clock."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the Charlotte Ballet produced and presented the American premiere of the ballet created at Sadler's Wells.

'''''The Onion Field''''' is a 1973 nonfiction book by [[Joseph Wambaugh]], a sergeant for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], chronicling the kidnapping of two [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] LAPD officers by a pair of criminals during a traffic stop and the subsequent murder of one of the officers.

== Crime ==
On the night of March 9, 1963, LAPD officers Ian Campbell (age 31) and [[Karl Francis Hettinger|Karl Hettinger]] (age 28), both former Marines, were riding in an unmarked "felony" car.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}&lt;!-- what's a felony car? --&gt; They pulled over a 1946 Ford coupe containing two suspicious-looking men at the corner of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Krajicek, David J"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Justice Story: Murder in the Onion Field|author= Krajicek, David J. |work=Special to The News (New York Daily News)| date=March 25, 2008 |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/justice-story-article-1.249124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070408/ap_en_ot/obit_smith_3|title='Onion Field' killer dead at 76|accessdate=2007-04-08|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070410200844/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070408/ap_en_ot/obit_smith_3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  two men, [[Gregory Powell (murderer)|Gregory Ulas Powell]] (age 30) and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a. "Jimmy Youngblood", age 32), had recently committed a string of robberies, and "each had a pistol tucked into his trousers."&lt;ref name="Krajicek, David J"/&gt; Powell, the driver, pulled a gun on Campbell, who "calmly told his partner, 'He has a gun in my back. Give him your gun.'" The two officers were then forced into Powell's car and, within 30 seconds after the traffic stop began, were driven north from Los Angeles on Route 99, to an onion field near [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], where Campbell was fatally shot.&lt;ref name="Krajicek, David J"/&gt; Hettinger was able to escape, running nearly four miles to reach a farmhouse.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"/&gt;

The killing occurred primarily because Powell assumed that the kidnapping of the officers alone already constituted a [[capital punishment|capital crime]] under the state's [[Federal Kidnapping Act|Little Lindbergh Law]]. However, Powell's interpretation was incorrect.  Under the Little Lindbergh Law kidnapping became a capital crime only if the victim were harmed or if a ransom were demanded. (Today, kidnapping in [[California]], where there is bodily harm short of death, is punishable either by imprisonment for 25 years to life, or by [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[parole]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Aftermath ==
In April 1982, following the release from prison of Powell's accomplice, Jimmy Lee Smith, Valerie Campbell, daughter of the slain Officer Ian Campbell, contacted John Mancino, founder of Citizens for Truth, an organization that had recently led a successful petition effort to rescind the parole date of convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, killer of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy.

Mancino drafted a petition to have Powell's scheduled release rescinded and with Valerie Campbell's help collected 31,500 signatures in three-and-a-half weeks, which were submitted to the California Board of Prison Terms, along with several thousand letters. The parole board then held a hearing and eventually rescinded Powell's release date.

Following this, Powell's attorney was successful in convincing Solano County Superior Court Judge, Ellis Randall, to order Powell's release from prison in ten days, ruling that Citizens for Truth's public outcry was the sole reason Powell's release was rescinded, which at the time was legally improper. Valerie Campbell then joined Citizens for Truth's representatives, John Mancino and Dr. Howard Garber, along with the group's attorneys, in filing a legal brief in the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, demanding that Powell remain in prison.

The group prevailed both at the appeals court and the California Supreme Court, thereby leading to Powell's spending the rest of his life in prison, where he died in 2012.

On August 10, 2012, the intersection of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood, the site of the officers' abduction, was named "Ian Campbell Square" in honor of the slain officer.  Additionally, a section of the Hollywood Freeway ([[California State Route 101]]) in Hollywood, from Hollywood Boulevard to Highland Avenue, was designated the "Ian J. Campbell Memorial Freeway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Onion Field Killer's Death Brings Closure for LAPD, Chief Says |date= August 13, 2012 |work= Los Angeles Times |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/08/onion-field-killer-lapd.html |access-date= April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hettinger===
{{main|Karl Francis Hettinger}}

Though Hettinger was able to escape, he felt scorned by his fellow officers and officials at the Los Angeles Police Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/09/local/me-powers9 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Myrna | last=Oliver | title=John W. Powers, 90; Legendary Officer in LAPD for 31 Years | date=December 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suffered severe emotional trauma for both the initial incident and the following treatment. Eventually a [[police training]] video was made using his experience as an example of what {{em|not}} to do when stopping and approaching a vehicle.

Hettinger was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1966, after being accused of shoplifting. Years later, Hettinger was elected to serve as a Supervisor for Kern County, California, where he served multiple consecutive terms. He died of [[liver disease]] in 1994, at the age of 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Malnic, Eric |work=Los Angeles Times| date= May 5, 1994 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-05/news/mn-53959_1_onion-field|title=Karl Hettinger; Survived 1963 'Onion Field' Attack|accessdate=  January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The suspects===
Powell was arrested on the night of the murder, after being spotted driving a stolen vehicle by California Highway Patrol officers. The following day, Smith was apprehended as well. The lead LAPD investigator on the case was Sergeant Pierce Brooks. Both suspects were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Ultimately, they received [[life sentence]]s. For each, the [[lower court]] sentence followed a second trial and several appeals. Their death sentences were vacated when the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[California v. Anderson]]'' (1972) that California's death penalty was [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Special to The News|title=The Justice Story: Murder in the Onion Field
|author= Krajicek, David J. |date= March 25, 2008|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/justice-story-article-1.249124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Powell====
{{main|Gregory Powell (murderer)}}

At a [[parole board]] hearing on January 27, 2010, Powell was denied parole. In a January 21, 2010 letter to state [[corrections]] officials, Los Angeles Police Union President Paul Weber urged the board to deny parole, calling Powell a "vicious murderer who has not yet paid his debt to society".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On October 18, 2011, the California State [[Parole Board]] denied [[compassionate release]] for Powell, who had been diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]]. The board stated that Powell did not wish to be released from prison and was likely to be uncooperative if paroled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 18, 2011|title= 'Onion Field' Killer Will Not Be Released|work=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/us/onion-field-killer-will-not-be-released.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Powell died on August 12, 2012, at the [[California Medical Facility]] in [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]]. He was 79 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 13, 2012|title='Onion Field' Killer Dies in Calif. Prison|work=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Smith====
Smith was initially released in 1982 but returned to prison several additional times on drug-related parole violations. In December 2006, he failed to report to his [[parole officer]], and a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] was issued for his arrest. In February 2007, a man matching Smith's description was detained by police in Los Angeles' [[Skid Row, Los Angeles, California|Skid Row]] area and eventually identified as Smith. He was arrested, charged with violating his parole, and sent to the Pitchess Detention Center in [[Castaic, California]]. On April 7, 2007, while in that facility, he died of an apparent [[heart attack]] at age 76.&lt;ref name="latobit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Quinones, Sam |date=April 7, 2007|title= Jimmy Lee Smith, infamous 'Onion Field' cop killer, dead at 76|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/jimmy-lee-smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television adaptations ==
The book was adapted into an [[The Onion Field (film)|1979 film of the same name]] directed by [[Harold Becker]]. It starred [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] as Karl Hettinger, [[James Woods]] as Gregory Powell, [[Franklyn Seales]] as Jimmy Smith, and [[Ted Danson]] (in his film debut) as Ian Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/13/entertainment/la-et-mn-the-onion-field-murder-movie-ted-danson-james-woods-in-1979-20120813|title='The Onion Field' film played role in keeping killer behind bars|last=King|first=Susan|date=2012-08-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]'s ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]'' season 5 episode 9 titled "Chaos" (original airdate April 10, 2013) portrayed a reimagined version of the events that took place in ''The Onion Field''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Hitfix|author=Sepinwall, Alan|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-southland-chaos-the-onion-field|title=Review: 'Southland' - 'Chaos': The onion field|date= April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.southlandfirst.com/2013/04/southland-s5e9-chaos-review.html| date=April 12, 2013|work=SouthLand First|title=SouthLAnd S5E9 "Chaos" review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Adam-12]]'' episode "Killing Ground" was based on this incident. Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed are kidnapped by two armed robbers on the run. The only difference is Malloy and Reed are able to escape and turn the tables on their captors.

'''''This River''''' is a 2016 Canadian short documentary film directed by [[Katherena Vermette]] and Erika MacPherson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/new-documentary-shows-lengths-taken-to-find-missing-1.3746810 "New documentary shows lengths taken to find missing family members"]. [[CBC News]], September 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The film centres on Drag the Red, a volunteer group in [[Manitoba]] who search the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] for the bodies of [[Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://muskratmagazine.com/this-river-documentary-searches-for-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-girls/ "This River Documentary Searches for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women &amp; Girls"]. ''Muskrat'', August 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith has stated that it was Vermette's ''North End Love Songs'' which helped draw her attention to the perspectives of indigenous youth from the North End and the experience of having missing family members.&lt;ref name="Larkins"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larkins|first1=David|title=New doc explores search for missing people|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2016/11/06/new-doc-explores-search-for-missing-people|accessdate=8 November 2016|work=Winnipeg Sun|date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal photography took place August 8 to 16, 2016, with an all-woman crew documenting the work of Drag the Red volunteer Kyle Kematch. The crew spent much of that time filming from a small fleet of donated boats. The director of photographer was Iris Ng, with Anita Lubosh recording sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/blog/2015/10/02/redemption-red-river-woman/|title=Redemption on the Red|last=Lewis|first=Philip|date=2015-10-02|work=NFB/blog|access-date=2017-06-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film received the 2016 Coup de coeur du jury award at Montreal's [[Terres en vues/Land InSights]] First Peoples' Festival and had its public premiere in Vermette's hometown of [[Winnipeg]] on October 5 at the [[Winnipeg Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts/local-film-about-tragic-red-river-searches-honoured-at-montreal-festival-389664751.html|title=Local film about tragic Red River searches honoured at Montreal festival|last=King|first=Randall|date=9 August 2016|work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[5th Canadian Screen Awards]] in 2017, the film won the [[Canadian Screen Award]] for Best Short Documentary Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Sue|title=Katherena Vermette doc This River wins Canadian Screen Award|url=http://www.quillandquire.com/awards/2017/03/13/katherena-vermette-doc-this-river-wins-canadian-screen-award/|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=Quill and Quire|date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''What Brings Us Here''==
Vermette and producer Alicia Smith also created a related [[Instagram]] work, ''What Brings Us Here'', which offers portraits of volunteers behind the community-run Winnipeg search teams the Bear Clan and Drag the Red.&lt;ref name="Cram"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cram|first1=Stephanie|title=Instagram project asks what attracts volunteers to patrol Winnipeg neighbourhoods|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/instagram-project-asks-what-attracts-volunteers-to-patrol-winnipeg-1.3824950|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chua|first1=June|title=Instagram project chronicles search for missing and murdered Indigenous women|url=http://rabble.ca/columnists/2016/11/instagram-project-chronicles-search-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=rabble.ca|date=10 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''What Brings Us Here'' features photos by Winnipeg photographers Janine Kropla, Mark Reimer and Karen Asher.
