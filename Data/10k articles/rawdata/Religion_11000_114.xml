      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3478">'''Adonai-Shomo''' was the name given to a [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] which existed from 1861 to 1896 in [[Massachusetts]].

==Second Coming==
The commune was founded by [[Frederick T. Howland]], a [[Quaker]] who had become convinced that the [[Second Coming]] of [[Christ]] and the subsequent [[Last Judgement]] would come shortly. On that basis, he started the commune, with initially roughly 30 members.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2002 p. 34"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=James |title=The encyclopedia of cults, sects, and new religions |publisher=Prometheus Books |publication-place=Amherst, N.Y |year=2002 |isbn=9781573928885 |page=34 |oclc=681492748 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/encyclopedia-of-cults-sects-and-new-religions/oclc/681492748/viewport}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Widdicombe 2017 p. 27"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Widdicombe |first1=Toby |first2=James M |last2=Morris |first3=Andrea L |last3=Kross |title=Historical dictionary of utopianism |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |publication-place=Lanham, Maryland |year=2017 |isbn=9781538102176 |page=27 |oclc=1011125989 |url={{Google books|LQolDwAAQBAJ|page=27|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New leaders==
Some years later, Howland died in an accident, leaving a leadership vacuum in the community. A man named Cook arrived and said that God had sent him to take over the community. The members of the group accepted him initially. However, Cook later began to institute some unusual sexual practices into the group, which led the members to depose him from the leadership and initiate criminal charges against him. Cook was replaced by a man named Richards, who led the group for several years, during which time it prospered and was able to purchase {{convert|840|acre|km2}} near [[Petersham, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Lewis 2002 p. 34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Widdicombe 2017 p. 27"/&gt;

==Disbanding==
In time, the older members of the commune began to die off, and several of the younger members left. Eventually, a group of the younger members filed suit against Richards to gain partial control of the group's property, eventually winning the suit. However, the money from the sale of the commune's land was barely sufficient to cover the group's debts and legal fees, leading the group to disband in 1896.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2002 p. 34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Widdicombe 2017 p. 27"/&gt;

The '''African Theological Archministry (ATA)''' is a charitable and spiritual Nonprofit 501(c)3 organization chartered in the state of South Carolina in 1980.  It spawned as a cultural, historical and spiritual movement in New York in the 1970s from the "Sango Temple", a branch of the ancient spiritual traditions of the ancient[[Yoruba religion|Isese of the Yoruba and Vodun of the Fon]], that was founded by [[Adefunmi|Oba Efuntola Oseijeman Adefunmi I]], born [[Adefunmi|Walter Eugene King]] in Detroit, MI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deolu|title=Must See!

He then moved the congregation of practitioners that had grown around him to [[South Carolina]], where they subsequently founded the [[Oyotunji]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews|first1=Carol|title=New Religions|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=1438106459|page=91|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=stQQJlV9FT8C|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has grown over the years, having nineteen affiliated centers in the United States in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Larry|last2=Melton|first2=J.

'''Ahmad Suradji''' (10 January 1949 – 10 July 2008) was an [[Indonesians|Indonesian]] [[serial killer]] who admitted to killing 42 girls and women between 1986 and 1997. His victims ranged in age from 11 to 30, and were strangled after being buried up to their waists in the ground as part of a ritual.&lt;ref name=documentary&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahmad Suradji: Indonesia's Sorcerer From Hell|publisher=[[Mediacorp Channel 5]]|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He buried his victims in a sugarcane plantation near his home, with their heads facing his house, which he believed would give him extra power.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/indonesia/2286216/Black-Magic-Killer-executed-for-42-murders.html|title=Black Magic Killer executed for 42 murders|date=11 July 2008|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suradji, a cattle-breeder, was also known as Nasib Kelewang, or by his alias Datuk.

==Arrest==
Suradji was arrested on 30 April 1997, after bodies were discovered near his home on the outskirts of [[Medan]], the capital of [[North Sumatra]].

His three wives, who were sisters, were also arrested for assisting in the murders and helping him hide the bodies. One of his wives, Tumini, was tried as his accomplice and was sentenced to death before it was reduced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name=wife.sentenced&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1034352/Sorcerer-killed-42-women-girls-enhance-magical-powers.html|title=Shaman murdered 42 women and girls in a bid to enhance his magical powers|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; He was sentenced to death by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] and executed on 10 July 2008.&lt;ref name=wife.sentenced/&gt;

==Murders==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
On 24 April 1997, 21-year-old Sri Kemala Dewi asked a 15-year-old [[rickshaw]] puller named Andreas to take her to "Datuk". She informed him to keep it a secret and never requested to be picked up.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Three days later, Dewi's naked and decomposing body was found in a sugarcane field by a man and was later dug up by a group of people who then called the police.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Andreas reported to the police and Dewi's family that he had dropped her off at Suradji's house three days earlier, and so police visited Suradji for confrontation.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Although he denied any links with Dewi's killing, police found Dewi's handbag, dress and bracelet in his home. He was later arrested on 30 April 1997.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; During interrogation, Suradji slowly confessed to Dewi's murder but also revealed that he had killed up to 42 girls in the same fashion and an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] process had to be carried out in the sugarcane field where Dewi's body was located.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Throughout the process, 42 bodies had been found with some being so decomposed to the point where they were unidentifiable.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt;

He told police that he had a dream in 1986 in which his father's ghost directed him to drink the saliva of 70 dead young women so that he could become a mystic healer.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Suradji thought that it would take him too long to encounter 70 dead women singly and so he took up the initiative to kill.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; As a [[Sorcerer (person)|sorcerer]], or [[dukun]], women came to him for spiritual advice for such things like making themselves more beautiful or richer or so Suradji could cast a spell on their spouses so they'll never have an affair.&lt;ref name=wife.sentenced/&gt;&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; He would take them into a sugarcane field and bury them up to their waist, claiming it was part of the ritual.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; He would then strangle them until they were dead and proceed to drink their saliva. After, he would strip the clothes from their bodies to accelerate decomposition and bury them back into the ground with their heads pointing toward his house.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Suradji stated the following to the police:

{{quote|My father did not specifically advise me to kill people. So I was thinking, it would take ages if I have to wait to get seventy women. I was trying to get to it as fast as possible, I took my own initiative to kill.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt;}}

{{Meso myth}}
{{Ancient Near East mythology}}
'''Mesopotamian religion''' refers to the [[religion|religious beliefs and practices]] of the civilizations of ancient [[Mesopotamia]], particularly [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]] between circa 3500 BC and 400 AD, after which they largely gave way to [[Syriac Christianity]]. The religious development of Mesopotamia and Mesopotamian culture in general was not particularly influenced by the movements of the various peoples into and throughout the area, particularly the south. Rather, Mesopotamian religion was a consistent and coherent tradition which adapted to the internal needs of its adherents over millennia of development.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mesopotamian-religion|title=Mesopotamian religion|publisher=Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest undercurrents of Mesopotamian religious thought date to the mid 4th millennium BC, and involved the [[nature worship|worship of forces of nature]] as providers of sustenance. In the 3rd millennium BC objects of worship were personified and became an expansive cast of divinities with particular functions. The last stages of Mesopotamian polytheism, which developed in the 2nd and 1st millenniums, introduced greater emphasis on personal religion and structured the gods into a monarchical hierarchy with the national god being the head of the pantheon.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; Mesopotamian religion finally declined with the spread of Iranian religions during the Achaemenid Empire and with the [[Christianization]] of Mesopotamia.

== History ==
{{See also|Sumerian religion|Babylonian religion}}
[[File:Mesopotamia.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Overview map of ancient Mesopotamia.]]
In the fourth millennium BC, the first evidence for what is recognisably Mesopotamian religion can be seen with the invention in Mesopotamia of [[writing]] circa 3500 BC.

The people of Mesopotamia originally consisted of two groups, [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian speakers]] (later divided into the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]]) and the people of [[Sumer]], who spoke a [[language isolate]]. These peoples were members of various [[city-state]]s and small [[monarchy|kingdoms]]. The Sumerians left the first records, and are believed to have been the founders of the civilisation of the [[Ubaid period]] (6500 BC to 3800 BC) in [[Upper Mesopotamia]]. By historical times they resided in southern Mesopotamia, which was known as [[Sumer]] (and much later, [[Babylonia]]), and had considerable influence on the Akkadian speakers and their culture. The Akkadian-speaking [[Semites]] are believed to have entered the region at some point between 3500 BC and 3000 BC, with Akkadian names first appearing in the regnal lists of these states c. 29th century BC.

The Sumerians were advanced: as well as inventing [[writing]], they also invented early forms of [[mathematics]], early [[wheel]]ed vehicles/[[chariot]]s, [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], written [[code of law]], organised [[medicine]], advanced [[agriculture]] and [[architecture]], and the [[calendar]]. They created the first [[city-state]]s such as [[Uruk]], [[Ur]], [[Lagash]], [[Isin]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Umma]], [[Eridu]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], [[Akshak]], [[Sippar]], [[Nippur]] and [[Larsa]], each of them ruled by an ''[[ensí]]''. The Sumerians remained largely dominant in this synthesised culture, however, until the rise of the [[Akkadian Empire]] under [[Sargon of Akkad]] circa 2335 BC, which united all of Mesopotamia under one ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:7–9)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was increasing [[syncretism]] between the Sumerian and Akkadian cultures and deities, with the Akkadians typically preferring to worship fewer [[deity|deities]] but elevating them to greater positions of power. Circa 2335 BC, [[Sargon of Akkad]] conquered all of Mesopotamia, uniting its inhabitants into the world's first empire and spreading its domination into ancient [[Iran]], the [[Levant]], [[Anatolia]], [[Canaan]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The Akkadian Empire endured for two centuries before collapsing due to economic decline, internal strife and attacks from the north east by the [[Gutian people]].

Following a brief Sumerian revival with the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] or [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]], Mesopotamia broke up into a number of Akkadian states. [[Assyria]] had evolved during the 25th century BC, and asserted itself in the north circa 2100 BC in the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] and southern Mesopotamia fragmented into a number of kingdoms, the largest being Isin, Larsa and [[Eshnunna]].

In 1894 BC the initially minor city-state of [[Babylon]] was founded in the south by invading [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]]-speaking [[Amorites]]. It was rarely ruled by native dynasties throughout its history.

Some time after this period, the Sumerians disappeared, becoming wholly absorbed into the Akkadian-speaking population.

Assyrian kings are attested from the late 25th century BC and dominated northern Mesopotamia and parts of eastern [[Anatolia]] and northeast [[Syria]].

Circa 1750 BC, the Amorite ruler of Babylon, King [[Hammurabi]], conquered much of Mesopotamia, but this empire collapsed after his death, and Babylonia was reduced to the small state it had been upon its founding. The Amorite dynasty was deposed in 1595 BC after attacks from mountain-dwelling people known as the [[Kassites]] from the [[Zagros Mountains]], who went on to rule Babylon for over 500 years.

Assyria, having been the dominant power in the region with the Old Assyrian Empire between the 20th and 18th centuries BC before the rise of Hammurabi, once more became a major power with the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1391–1050 BC). Assyria defeated the [[Hittites]] and [[Mitanni]], and its growing power forced the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] to withdraw from the [[Near East]]. The Middle Assyrian Empire at its height stretched from the [[Caucasus]] to modern [[Bahrain]] and from [[Cyprus]] to western Iran.

The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC) was the most dominant power on earth and the largest empire the world had yet seen between the 10th century BC and the late 7th century BC, with an empire stretching from [[Cyprus]] in the west to central [[Iran]] in the east, and from the [[Caucasus]] in the north to [[Nubia]], [[Egypt]] and the Arabian Peninsula in the south, facilitating the spread of Mesopotamian culture and religion far and wide under emperors such as [[Ashurbanipal]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]], [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Shalmaneser IV]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]] and [[Esarhaddon]]. During the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Mesopotamian [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] became the [[lingua franca]] of the empire, and also Mesopotamia proper. The last written records in Akkadian were [[astrology|astrological texts]] dating from 78 CE discovered in Assyria.

The empire fell between 612 BC and 599 BC after a period of severe internal civil war in Assyria which soon spread to Babylonia, leaving Mesopotamia in a state of chaos. A weakened Assyria was then subject to combined attacks by a coalition of hitherto vassals, in the form of the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Scythians]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Sagartians]] and [[Cimmerians]] beginning in 616 BC. These were led by [[Nabopolassar]] of Babylon and [[Cyaxares]] of Media and Persia. [[Nineveh]] was sacked in 612 BC, [[Harran]] fell in 608 BC, [[Carchemish]] in 605 BC, and final traces of Assyrian imperial administration disappeared from [[Dūr-Katlimmu]] by 599 BC.

Babylon had a brief late flowering of power and influence, initially under the migrant Chaldean dynasty, which took over much of the empire formerly held by their northern kinsmen. However, the last king of Babylonia, [[Nabonidus]], an Assyrian, paid little attention to politics, preferring to worship the [[lunar deity]] [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], leaving day-to-day rule to his son [[Belshazzar]]. This and the fact that the [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Medes]] to the east were growing in power now that the might of Assyria that had held them in [[vassal]]age for centuries was gone, spelt the death knell for native Mesopotamian power. The [[Achaemenid Empire]] conquered the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in 539 BC, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, although Mesopotamian people, culture and religion continued to endure after this.

=== Effect of Assyrian religious beliefs on its political structure ===
Like many nations in Mesopotamian history, Assyria was originally, to a great extent, an [[oligarchy]] rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with "the city", and the [[polity]] had three main centres of power—an assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an [[eponym]]. The ruler presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. He was not referred to with the usual Akkadian term for "king", ''šarrum''; that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], of whom the ruler was the [[high priest]]. The ruler himself was only designated as "steward of Assur" (''iššiak Assur''), where the term for steward is a borrowing from Sumerian ''ensí''. The third centre of power was the eponym (''limmum''), who gave the year his name, similarly to the [[eponymous archon]] and [[Roman consul]]s of [[classical antiquity]]. He was annually elected by [[Sortition|lot]] and was responsible for the economic administration of the city, which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. The institution of the eponym as well as the formula ''iššiak Assur'' lingered on as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Larsen, Mogens Trolle |year=2000 |chapter=The old Assyrian city-state |editor-last=Hansen |editor-first=Mogens Herman |title=A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures: an investigation / conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre |pages=77–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Refers to entire paragraph on political structure --&gt;

==== Religion in the Neo-Assyrian Empire ====
The religion of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] centered around the Assyrian king as the king of their lands as well. However, kingship at the time was linked very closely with the idea of divine mandate.&lt;ref name="Bertman66"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian king, while not being a god himself, was acknowledged as the chief servant of the chief god, [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]. In this manner, the king's authority was seen as absolute so long as the high priest reassured the peoples that the gods, or in the case of the [[Henotheism|henotheistic]] Assyrians, the God, was pleased with the current ruler.&lt;ref name="Bertman66" /&gt; For the Assyrians who lived in [[Assur]] and the surrounding lands, this system was the norm. For the conquered peoples, however, it was novel, particularly to the people of smaller city-states. In time, Ashur was promoted from being the local deity of Assur to the overlord of the vast Assyrian domain, which spread from the Caucasus and [[Armenia]] in the north to Egypt, Nubia and the Arabian Peninsula in the south, and from Cyprus and the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west to central Iran in the east.&lt;ref name="Bertman66" /&gt; [[Ashur (god)|Assur]], the patron deity of the city of Assur from the late [[Bronze Age]], was in constant rivalry with the patron deity of Babylon, [[Marduk]]. Worship was conducted in his name throughout the lands dominated by the Assyrians. With the worship of Assur across much of the [[Fertile Crescent]], the Assyrian king could command the loyalty of his fellow servants of Assur.

=== Later Mesopotamian history ===
In 539 BC, Mesopotamia was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539–332 BC), then ruled by [[Cyrus the Great]]. This brought to an end over 3,000 years of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] Mesopotamian dominance of the Near East. The [[Persian people|Persians]] maintained and did not interfere in the native culture and religion and Assyria and Babylon continued to exist as entities (although Chaldea and the Chaldeans disappeared), and Assyria was strong enough to launch major rebellions against [[Persia]] in 522 and 482 BC. During this period the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] evolved in Assyria, and were centuries later to be the vehicle for the spread of [[Syriac Christianity]] throughout the near east.

Then, two centuries later in 330 BC the [[Macedon]]ian [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] emperor [[Alexander the Great]] overthrew the Persians and took control of Mesopotamia itself. After Alexander's death increased [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] influence was brought to the region by the [[Seleucid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:17–18)&lt;/ref&gt; Assyria and Babylonia later became provinces under the [[Parthian Empire]] ([[Athura]] and province of [[Persian Babylonia|Babylonia]]), [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (province of [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]]) and [[Sassanid Empire]] (province of [[Asuristan]]). Babylonia was dissolved as an entity during the Parthian Empire, though Assyria endured as a geo-political entity until the 7th century AD [[Arab]] [[Islamic conquest]].

During the [[Parthian Empire]] there was a major revival in Assyria (known as [[Athura]] and [[Assuristan]]) between the 2nd century BC and 4th century CE,&lt;ref&gt;^ Crone &amp; Cook 1977, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; with temples once more being dedicated to gods such as Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Hadad and Ishtar in independent [[Neo-Assyrian]] states such as [[Assur]], [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Beth Garmai]], [[Hatra]] and [[Beth Nuhadra]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, John (November 2003). "The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq" (PDF). L’archéologie de l’empire achéménide (Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crone &amp; Cook 1977, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Christianization of Mesopotamia beginning in the 1st century CE the independent Assyrian states of [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Assur]], [[Hatra]], [[Beth Nuhadra]] and [[Beth Garmai]] were largely ruled by converts to home grown forms of still extant [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] in the form of the [[Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], as well as [[Judaism]]. [[Gnostic]] sects such as [[Sabianism]] and the still extant [[Mandeanism]] also became popular, though native religions still coexisted alongside these new [[monotheistic]] religions among the native populace; gods such as Ashur and Sin were still worshiped until the 4th century CE in Assyria. In the 3rd century CE another native Mesopotamian religion flourished, [[Manicheanism]], which incorporated elements of Christianity, Judaism, [[Buddhism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]], as well as local Mesopotamian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Widengren |first=Geo  |title=Mesopotamian elements in Manichaeism (King and Saviour II): Studies in Manichaean, Mandaean, and Syrian-gnostic religion |publisher=Lundequistska bokhandeln |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
{{Main|Mesopotamian myths}}

There are no specific written records explaining Mesopotamian [[religious cosmology]] that survive to us today. Nonetheless, modern scholars have examined various accounts, and created what is believed to be an at least partially accurate depiction of Mesopotamian cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:77–78)&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Epic of Creation'', dated to 1200 BC, it explains that the god Marduk killed the mother goddess [[Tiamat]] and used half her body to create the earth, and the other half to create both the [[paradise]] of ''šamû'' and the [[underworld|netherworld]] of ''irṣitu''.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:79)&lt;/ref&gt; A document from a similar period stated that the universe was a spheroid, with three levels of ''šamû'', where the gods dwelt, and where the stars existed, above the three levels of earth below it.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:80)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deities ===
{{further|List of Mesopotamian deities}}

[[File:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000-detail.jpg|thumb|150px|The goddess [[Ishtar]], winged and wearing a version of the horned cap of divinity. Detail of the so-called "Ishtar vase", early 2nd millennium BC ([[Louvre]] AO 17000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jeremy Black |author2=Anthony Green |title=Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary |year=1992 |isbn=0-292-70794-0 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mesopotamian religion was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], thereby accepting the existence of many different deities, both male and female, though it was also [[henotheism|henotheistic]],&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:41)&lt;/ref&gt; with certain gods being viewed as superior to others by their specific devotees. These devotees were often from a particular city or city-state that held that deity as its [[patron]] deity, for instance the god [[Enki]] was often associated with the city of [[Eridu]] in Sumer, the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] with [[Assur]] and [[Assyria]], [[Enlil]] with the Sumerian city of [[Nippur]], [[Ishtar]] with the Assyrian city of [[Erbil|Arbela]], and the god [[Marduk]] was associated with [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:53)&lt;/ref&gt; Though the full number of gods and goddesses found in Mesopotamia is not known, K. Tallqvist, in his ''Akkadische Götterepitheta'' (1938) counted around two thousand four hundred that we now know about, most of which had Sumerian names. In the [[Sumerian language]], the gods were referred to as ''dingir'', while in the Akkadian language they were known as ''ilu'' and it seems that there was syncreticism between the gods worshipped by the two groups, adopting one another's deities.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:45" /&gt;

The Mesopotamian gods bore many similarities with humans, and were [[anthropomorphic]], thereby having humanoid form. Similarly, they often acted like humans, requiring food and drink, as well as drinking alcohol and subsequently suffering the effects of [[drunkenness]],&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:64–66)&lt;/ref&gt; but were thought to have a higher degree of perfection than common men. They were thought to be more powerful, all-seeing and all-knowing, unfathomable, and, above all, immortal. One of their prominent features was a terrifying brightness (''melammu'') which surrounded them, producing an immediate reaction of awe and reverence among men.&lt;ref name="Ringgren_a"&gt;Ringgren (1974: 50)&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the various deities were family relations of one another, a trait found in many other polytheistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:50)&lt;/ref&gt; The historian J. Bottéro was of the opinion that the gods were not viewed [[mysticism|mystically]], but were instead seen as high-up masters who had to be obeyed and feared, as opposed to loved and adored.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:37"&gt;Bottéro (2001:37)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, many Mesopotamians, of all classes, often had names that were devoted to a certain deity; this practice appeared to have begun in the third millennium BC among the Sumerians, but also was later adopted by the Akkadians, Assyrians and Babylonians as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:39)&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] was not ordered, but later Mesopotamian theologians came up with the concept of ranking the deities in order of importance. A Sumerian list of around 560 deities that did this was uncovered at Farm and Tell Abû Ṣalābīkh and dated to circa 2600 BC, ranking five primary deities as being of particular importance.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:48–49)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important of these early Mesopotamian deities was the god [[Enlil]], who was originally a Sumerian divinity viewed as a king of the gods and a controller of the world, who was later adopted by the Akkadians. Another was the Sumerian god An, who served a similar role to Enlil and became known as [[Anu]] among the Akkadians. The Sumerian god [[Enki]] was later also adopted by the Akkadians, initially under his original name, and later as [[Éa (Babylonian god)|Éa]]. Similarly the Sumerian moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]] became the Akkadian Sîn while the Sumerian sun god [[Utu]] became the Akkadian [[Shamash]]. One of the most notable goddesses was the Sumerian sex and war deity [[Inanna]]. With the later rise to power of the Babylonians in the 18th century BC, the king, [[Hammurabi]], declared Marduk, a deity who before then had not been of significant importance, to a position of supremacy alongside Anu and Enlil in southern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:54)&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most significant legend to survive from Mesopotamian religion is the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], which tells the story of the heroic king [[Gilgamesh]] and his wild friend [[Enkidu]], and the former's search for immortality which is entwined with all the gods and their approval. It also contains the earliest reference to [[The Great Flood]].

=== Public devotions ===
{{see|Mesopotamian temple}}
Each Mesopotamian city was home to a deity, and each of the prominent deities was the patron of a city, and all known temples were located in cities, though there may have been shrines in the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider (2011: 39)&lt;/ref&gt; The temple itself was constructed of mud brick in the form of a [[ziggurat]], which rose to the sky in a series of stairstep stages. Its significance and symbolism have been the subject of much discussion, but most regard the tower as a kind of staircase or ladder for the god to descend from and ascend to the heavens, though there are signs which point towards an actual cult having been practiced in the upper temple, so the entire temple may have been regarded as a giant altar. Other theories treat the tower as an image of the cosmic mountain where a dying and rising god "lay buried." Some temples, such as the temple of Enki in Eridu contained a holy tree (''kiskanu'') in a holy grove, which was the central point of various rites performed by the king, who functioned as a "master gardener."&lt;ref name="Ringgren"&gt;Ringgren (1974:78)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesopotamian temples were originally built to serve as dwelling places for the god, who was thought to reside and hold court on earth for the good of the city and kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider (2001: 66)&lt;/ref&gt; His presence was symbolized by an image of the god in a separate room. The god's presence within the image seems to have been thought of in a very concrete way, as instruments for the presence of the deity."&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:77)&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident from the poem ''How Erra Wrecked the World'', in which [[Erra (god)|Erra]] deceived the god Marduk into leaving his [[Cult image|cult statue]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:65)&lt;/ref&gt; Once constructed, idols were consecrated through special nocturnal rituals where they were given "life", and their mouth "was opened" (''pet pî'') and washed (''mes pî'') so they could see and eat.&lt;ref name="Ringgren" /&gt; If the deity approved, it would accept the image and agree to "inhabit" it. These images were also entertained, and sometime escorted on hunting expeditions. In order to service the gods, the temple was equipped with a household with kitchens and kitchenware, sleeping rooms with beds and side rooms for the deity's family, as well as a courtyard with a basin and water for cleansing visitors, as well as a stable for the god's chariot and draft animals.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider (2011:68)&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the god's well-being was maintained through service, or work (''dullu''). The image was dressed and served banquets twice a day. It is not known how the god was thought to consume the food, but a curtain was drawn before the table while he or she "ate", just as the king himself was not allowed to be seen by the masses while he ate. Occasionally, the king shared in these meals, and the priests may have had some share in the offerings as well. Incense was also burned before the image, because it was thought that the gods enjoyed the smell. Sacrificial meals were also set out regularly, with a sacrificial animal seen as a replacement (''pūhu'') or substitute (''dinānu'') for a man, and it was considered that the anger of the gods or demons was then directed towards the sacrificial animal. Additionally, certain days required extra sacrifices and ceremonies for certain gods, and every day was sacred to a particular god.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 81–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

The king was thought, in theory, to be the religious leader (''enu'' or ''šangū'') of the cult and exercised a large number of duties within the temple, with a large number of specialists whose task was to mediate between men and gods:&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 79)&lt;/ref&gt; a supervising or "watchman" priest (''šešgallu''), priests for individual purification against demons and magicians (''āšipu''), priests for the purification of the temple (''mašmašu''), priests to appease the wrath of the gods with song and music (''kalū''), as well as female singers (''nāru''), male singers (''zammeru''), craftsmen (''mārē ummāni''), swordbearers (''nāš paṭri''), masters of divination (''[[bārû]]''), penitents (''šā'ilu''), and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:80)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private devotions ===
Besides the worship of the gods at public rituals, individuals also paid homage to a personal deity. As with other deities, the personal gods changed over time and little is known about early practice as they are rarely named or described. In the mid-third millennium BC, some rulers regarded a particular god or gods as being their personal protector. In the second millennium BC, personal gods began to function more on behalf of the common man,&lt;ref name="Schneider 2011: 59"&gt;Schneider (2011: 59)&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had a close, personal relationship, maintained through prayer and maintenance of his god's statue.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:91ff"&gt;Bottéro (2001:91ff)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of written [[prayers]] have survived from ancient Mesopotamia, each of which typically exalt the god that they are describing above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:29–30)&lt;/ref&gt; The historian J. Bottéro stated that these poems display "extreme reverence, profound devotion, [and] the unarguable emotion that the [[supernatural]] evoked in the hearts of those ancient believers" but that they showed a people who were scared of their gods rather than openly celebrating them.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:37" /&gt; They were thought to offer good luck, success, and protection from disease and demons,&lt;ref name="Schneider 2011: 59"/&gt; and one's place and success in society was thought to depend on his personal deity, including the development of his certain talents and even his personality. This was even taken to the point that everything he experienced was considered a reflection of what was happening to his personal god.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:91ff"/&gt; When a man neglected his god, it was assumed that the demons were free to inflict him, and when he revered his god, that god was like a shepherd who seeks food for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dhorme |first=P. |year=1910 |title=La Religion Assyro-Babylonienne |location=Paris |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a strong belief in [[demons]] in Mesopotamia, and private individuals, like the temple priests, also participated in incantations (šiptu) to ward them off.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 89)&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was no collective term for these beings either in Sumerian or Akkadian, they were merely described as harmful or dangerous beings or forces, and they were used as a logical way to explain the existence of evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:63)&lt;/ref&gt; They were thought to be countless in number, and were thought to even attack the gods as well. Besides demons, there were also spirits of the dead, (etimmu) who could also cause mischief. Amulets were occasionally used, and sometimes a special priest or exorcist ([[āšipu]] or mašmašu) was required. Incantations and ceremonies were also used to cure diseases which were also thought to be associated with demonic activity, sometimes making use of [[sympathetic magic]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 90–91)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes an attempt was made to capture a demon by making an image of it, placing it above the head of a sick person, then destroying the image, which the demon was somehow likely to inhabit. Images of protecting spirits were also made and placed at gates to ward off disaster.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974: 92-93"&gt;Ringgren (1974: 92–93)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Divination]] was also employed by private individuals, with the assumption that the gods have already determined the destinies of men and these destinies could be ascertained through observing omens and through rituals (e.g., casting lots).&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974: 92-93"/&gt; It was believed that the gods expressed their will through "words" (amatu) and "commandments" (qibitu) which were not necessarily spoken, but were thought to manifest in the unfolding routine of events and things.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:92)&lt;/ref&gt; There were countless ways to divine the future, such as observing oil dropped into a cup of water ([[lecanomancy]]), observing the entrails of sacrificial animals ([[extispicy]]), observation of the behavior of birds ([[augury]]) and observing celestial and meteorological phenomena ([[astrology]]), as well as through interpretation of dreams. Often interpretation of these phenomena required the need for two classes of priests: askers (sa'ilu) and observer ([[Bārû|baru]]), and also sometimes a lower class of ecstatic seer (mahhu) that was also associated with [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 93–95)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ancient [[paganism]] tended to focus more on duty and ritual than morality, a number of general moral virtues can be gleaned from surviving prayers and myths. It was believed that man originated as a divine act of creation, and the gods were believed to be the source of life, and held power over sickness and health, as well as the destinies of men. Personal names show that each child was considered a gift from divinity.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:108"&gt;Ringgren (1974:108)&lt;/ref&gt; Man was believed to have been created to serve the gods, or perhaps wait on them: the god is lord (''belu'') and man is servant or slave (''ardu''), and was to fear (''puluhtu'') the gods and have the appropriate attitude towards them. Duties seem to have been primarily of a cultic and ritual nature,&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:111–112)&lt;/ref&gt; although some prayers express a positive psychological relationship, or a sort of conversion experience in regard to a god.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:116"&gt;Ringgren (1974:116)&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the reward to mankind is described as success and long life.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:108"/&gt;

Every man also had duties to his fellow man which had some religious character, particularly the king's duties to his subjects. It was thought that one of the reasons the gods gave power to the king was to exercise justice and righteousness,&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:110)&lt;/ref&gt; described as ''mēšaru'' and ''kettu'', literally "straightness, rightness, firmness, truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:112)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include not alienating and causing dissension between friends and relatives, setting innocent prisoners free, being truthful, being honest in trade, respecting boundary lines and property rights, and not putting on airs with subordinates. Some of these guidelines are found in the second tablet of the ''[[Šurpu]]'' incantation series.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:113-115"/&gt;

Sin, on the other hand, was expressed by the words ''hitu'' (mistake, false step), ''annu'' or ''arnu'' (rebellion), and ''qillatu'' (sin or curse),&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:113-115"/&gt; with strong emphasis on the idea of rebellion, sometimes with the idea that sin is man's wishing to "live on his own terms" (ina ramanisu). Sin also was described as anything which incited the wrath of the gods. Punishment came through sickness or misfortune,&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:116"/&gt; which inevitably lead to the common reference to unknown sins, or the idea that one can transgress a divine prohibition without knowing it—psalms of lamentation rarely mention concrete sins. This idea of retribution was also applied to the nation and history as a whole. A number of examples of Mesopotamian literature show how war and natural disasters were treated as punishment from the gods, and how kings were used as a tool for deliverance.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:118)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumerian myths suggest a prohibition against premarital sex.&lt;ref&gt;''Celibacy in the Ancient World: Its Ideal and Practice in Pre-Hellenistic Israel, Mesopotamia, and Greece'' by Dale Launderville, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; Marriages were often arranged by the parents of the bride and groom; engagements were usually completed through the approval of contracts recorded on clay tablets. These marriages became legal as soon as the groom delivered a bridal gift to his bride's father. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that premarital sex was a common, but surreptitious, occurrence.&lt;ref name=Kramer1963&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Samuel Noah|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=The Univ. of Chicago Press|location=|isbn=0-226-45238-7|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/sumerians.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} Outside Sumerian society, Mesopotamian religion and culture were highly sexualized, more so in Babylonia than Assyria, where free sexual expression was viewed as one of the natural benefits of civilized life—same gender attraction, transgender individuals, and male and female prostitution were tolerated, and in some cases considered [[sacred prostitution|sacred]]. The worship of Inanna/Ishtar, which was prevalent in Mesopotamia could involve wild, frenzied dancing and bloody ritual celebrations of social and physical abnormality. It was believed that "nothing is prohibited to Inanna", and that by depicting transgressions of normal human social and physical limitations, including traditional gender definition, one could cross over from the "conscious everyday world into the trance world of spiritual ecstasy."&lt;ref&gt;Meador (2000:164)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Afterlife ==
The ancient Mesopotamians believed in an [[afterlife]] that was a land below our world. It was this land, known alternately as ''Arallû'', ''Ganzer'' or ''[[Irkalla|Irkallu]]'', the latter of which meant "Great Below", that it was believed everyone went to after death, irrespective of social status or the actions performed during life.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:108)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Christian Hell, the Mesopotamians considered the underworld neither a punishment nor a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choksi|first1=M.|title=Ancient Mesopotamian Beliefs in the Afterlife|url=http://www.ancient.eu.com/article/701/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the condition of the dead was hardly considered the same as the life previously enjoyed on earth: they were considered merely weak and powerless ghosts. The myth of Ishtar's descent into the underworld relates that "dust is their food and clay their nourishment, they see no light, where they dwell in darkness." Stories such as the Adapa myth resignedly relate that, due to a blunder, all men must die and that true everlasting life is the sole property of the gods.&lt;ref name="Ringgren_a" /&gt;

== Eschatology ==
There are no known Mesopotamian tales about the [[End Time|end of the world]], although it has been speculated that they believed that this would eventually occur. This is largely because [[Berossus]] wrote that the Mesopotamians believed the world to last "twelve times twelve ''sars''"; with a ''sar'' being 3,600 years, this would indicate that at least some of the Mesopotamians believed that the Earth would only last 518,400 years. Berossus does not report what was thought to follow this event, however.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:95)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical study ==

=== Challenges ===
The modern study of Mesopotamia ([[Assyriology]]) is still a fairly young science, beginning only in the middle of the Nineteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Scheider (2011: 128)&lt;/ref&gt; and the study of Mesopotamian religion can be a complex and difficult subject because, by nature, their religion was governed only by usage, not by any official decision,&lt;ref&gt;Bottero (2001: 47)&lt;/ref&gt; and by nature it was neither dogmatic nor systematic. Deities, characters, and their actions within myths changed in character and importance over time, and occasionally depicted different, sometimes even contrasting images or concepts. This is further complicated by the fact that scholars are not entirely certain what role religious texts played in the Mesopotamian world.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider (2011:38–39)&lt;/ref&gt;

For many decades, some scholars of the Ancient Near East argued that it was impossible to define there as being a singular Mesopotamian religion, with Leo Oppenheim (1964) stating that "a systematic presentation of Mesopotamian religion cannot and should not be written. "&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:26)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[Jean Bottéro]], the author of ''Religion in Ancient Mesopotamia'', disagreed, believing that it would be too complicated to divide the religion into many smaller groups, stating that:

: Should we dwell on a certain social or cultural category: the "official religion, " the "private religion, " the religion of the "educated"... Should we emphasise a certain city or province: [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], Assyria? Should we concentrate on a certain period in time: the [[Seleucid]], the [[Achaemenid]], the [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]], the [[Neo-Assyrian]], the [[Kassite]], the Old Babylonian, the Neo-Sumerian, or the Old Akkadian period? Since, contrary to what some would imprudently lead us to believe, there were no distinct religions but only successive states of the same religious system...&amp;nbsp;– such an approach would be excessive, even pointless.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:27)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Panbabylonism ===
{{Main|Panbabylonism}}
According to [[Panbabylonism]], a school of thought founded by [[Hugo Winckler]] and held in the early 20th century among primarily German Assyriologists, there was a common cultural system extending over the Ancient Near East which was overwhelmingly influenced by the Babylonians. According to this theory the religions of the Near East were rooted in Babylonian astral science- including the Hebrew Bible and Judaism. This theory of a Babylonian-derived Bible originated from the discovery of a stele in the acropolis of Susa bearing a Babylonian flood myth with many similarities to the flood of Genesis, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. However, [[flood myth]]s appear in almost every culture around the world, including cultures that never had contact with Mesopotamia. The fundamental tenets of Panbabylonism were eventually dismissed as pseudoscientific,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pF-rCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Freudian Orient: Early Psychoanalysis, Anti-Semitic Challenge, and the Vicissitudes of Orientalist Discourse|first=Frank F.|last=Scherer|date=18 November 2017|publisher=Karnac Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Assyriologists and biblical scholars recognize the influence of Babylonian mythology on Jewish mythology and other Near Eastern mythologies, albeit indirect. Indeed, similarities between both religious traditions may draw from even older sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=R.

== Influence ==
=== Gnosticism ===

=== Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism ===
=== Biblical eschatology ===
In the New Testament [[Book of Revelation]], Babylonian religion is associated with religious apostasy of the lowest order, the archetype of a political/religious system heavily tied to global commerce, and it is depicted as a system which, according to the author, continued to hold sway in the first century CE, eventually to be utterly annihilated. According to some interpretations, this is believed to refer to the [[Roman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keener |first=Craig S. |year=1993 |title=The IVP Bible Background Commentary, New Testament |publisher=Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, Illinois |page=806}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to other interpretations, this system remains extant in the world until the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Adam |title=Commentary and Critical Notes |volume= 3 |publisher=Abingdon Press |location=Nashville, Tennessee |page=1045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamieson |first=Rev.

For in one hour your judgment has come.' And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more..."

=== Popular culture ===
Mesopotamian religion, culture, history and mythology has influenced some forms of music. As well as traditional [[Assyrian/Syriac folk music|Syriac folk music]], many [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands have named themselves after Mesopotamian gods and historical figures, including the partly Assyrian band [[Melechesh]].

=== New religious movements ===
Various [[new religious movements]] in the 20th and 21st centuries have been founded that venerate some of the deities found in ancient Mesopotamian religion, including various strains of [[neopaganism]] that have adopted the worship of the historical Mesopotamian gods.

== Reconstruction ==
As with most dead religions, many aspects of the common practices and intricacies of the doctrine have been lost and forgotten over time. However, much of the information and knowledge has survived, and great work has been done by historians and scientists, with the help of religious scholars and translators, to re-construct a working knowledge of the religious history, customs, and the role these beliefs played in everyday life in Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia, Ebla and Chaldea during this time. Mesopotamian religion is thought to have been an influence on subsequent religions throughout the world, including [[ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite]], [[Arameans#Religion and art|Aramean]], and [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek]].

Mesopotamian religion was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], worshipping over 2,100 different deities,&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:45"&gt;Bottéro (2001:45)&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were associated with a specific state within Mesopotamia, such as Sumer, Akkad, Assyria or Babylonia, or a specific Mesopotamian city, such as;  ([[Ashur]]), [[Nineveh]], [[Ur]], [[Nippur]], [[Erbil|Arbela]], [[Harran]], [[Uruk]], [[Ebla]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Eridu]], [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Sippar]], [[Gasur]], [[Ekallatum]], [[Til Barsip]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Babylon]].

Some of the most significant of these Mesopotamian deities were [[Anu]], [[Enki]], [[Enlil]], [[Ishtar]] ([[Astarte]]), [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], [[Shamash]], [[Shulmanu]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin (Nanna)]], [[Kur]], [[Dagon|Dagan]] ([[Dagon]]), [[Ninurta]], [[Nisroch]], [[Nergal]], [[Tiamat]], [[Ninlil]], [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]], [[Tishpak]] and [[Marduk]].

Mesopotamian religion has historically the oldest body of recorded literature of any religious tradition. What is known about Mesopotamian religion comes from [[archaeology|archaeological evidence]] uncovered in the region, particularly numerous literary sources, which are usually written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Assyro-Babylonian]]) or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] using [[cuneiform script]] on clay tablets and which describe both mythology and [[cult (religious practice)|cultic]] practices. Other artifacts can also be useful when reconstructing Mesopotamian religion. As is common with most ancient civilizations, the objects made of the most durable and precious materials, and thus more likely to survive, were associated with religious beliefs and practices. This has prompted one scholar to make the claim that the Mesopotamian's "entire existence was infused by their religiosity, just about everything they have passed on to us can be used as a source of knowledge about their religion."&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:21–22)&lt;/ref&gt; While Mesopotamian religion had almost completely died out by approximately 400–500 CE after its indigenous adherents had largely become [[Assyrian Christians]], it has still had an influence on the modern world, predominantly because many biblical stories that are today found in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Mandaeism]] were possibly based upon earlier Mesopotamian myths, in particular that of the [[creation myth]], the [[Garden of Eden]], the [[flood myth]], the [[Tower of Babel]], figures such as [[Nimrod]] and [[Lilith]] and the [[Book of Esther]]. It has also inspired various contemporary [[neo-pagan]] groups.

== Fringe theories ==
The unusual and apparently physical closeness of gods to men in these stories has prompted various speculations including [[Julian Jaynes]]'s theory of the [[bicameral mind]] and [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s [[ancient astronauts]] theory. While rejected in scholarship, such speculations have influenced many science fiction stories and movies.

'''Burqush''' or '''Burkush''' ({{lang-ar|برقش}}) is an archaeological site situated {{convert|30|km|mi}} west of [[Damascus]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Beattie|author2=Timothy Pepper|title=The Rough Guide to Syria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9iCfkTe8v2EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA16|accessdate=21 September 2012|date=1 July 2001|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-718-8|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RuprechtsbergerErtel1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erwin Maria Ruprechtsberger|author2=Christine Ertel|title=Vom Mount Hermon zum Djebel Burqush|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KkKMAEACAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=Stadtmuseum Linz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby [[Wadi al-Qarn – Burqush Important Bird Area|Wadi al-Qarn]] is an important breeding site for wild [[bird]]s in the [[Middle East]] and has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]].&lt;ref name="EvansEast1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=M. I. Evans |title=Important bird areas in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZrwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1994|publisher=BirdLife International|isbn=978-0-946888-28-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site sits at an [[altitude]] of {{convert|1580|m|ft}} and overlooks the [[Damascus]] plain and surrounding hill country where herds of [[goat]]s and [[camel]]s wander the area. Due to the sensitive nature of the territory close to the borders with [[Lebanon]] and the [[Golan]], visitors may need a military escort to access the site, which is a ten-minute walk along a steep track away from the main road.&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"/&gt;

Julien Aliquot suggested that the site may have been called '''Barkousa''' in ancient times. This was contrary to the location of '''Barkusha''' that had previously been suggested by [[Albrecht Alt]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century, it was renamed '''Justinianopolis''' ({{lang-el|Ἰουστινιανούπολις}}, "city of Justinian") after the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~tcrnadk/Lovell_2011.pdf Klein, Konstantin., Review of Aliquot, J., Inscriptions Grecques et Latines de la Syrie - Tome 11: Mount Hermon (Liban et Syrie) Beirut: Presses de l'IFPO (Bibliothèque archéologique et historique 183) Reviews, Levant, Vol 43, No 1, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Potts2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

==Byzantine basilica and Roman temple==
There are the ruins of two [[Roman temple]]s in the village that are included in a group of [[Temples of Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer20082"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=Aliquot, Julien., Sanctuaries and villages on Mount Hermon in the Roman period in The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=17 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dar1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shimʻon Dar|title=Settlements and cult sites on Mount Hermon, Israel: Ituraean culture in the Hellenistic and Roman periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuwtAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 September 2012|year=1993|publisher=Tempus Reparatum|isbn=978-0-86054-756-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of a 6th-century CE [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]] lie on the top of a hill which has been artificially flattened to form a two level plateau. The area around features numerous rock cut rooms and crypts. The podium on which the basilica is constructed is suggested to be that of a previous [[Roman temple]] suggested to date to the 1st century CE. The Roman temple itself is thought to have been built on the remains of a previous temple that had been in use for secular purposes for at least four hundred years earlier and possibly for many generations prior. The basilica is constructed of massive blocks of stone and the site is littered with other confusing blocks, some of which possibly resemble buildings or unusual [[geological]] outcrops.&lt;ref name="BeattiePepper2001"/&gt;

The temple complex at Burqush was mentioned by the [[Germany|German]] archaeological mission to [[Baalbek]] in 1903 and has received little study since then. A [[topographic]] and architectural survey of the site was conducted in 1999 by Gunnar Brands for the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]. A dissertation covering the results of the survey is in progress by Frederike von Bargen.&lt;ref name="brands"&gt;[http://www.orientarch.uni-halle.de/digs/burqush/burqush.htm Burqush (Syria) - Archaeological Survey 1999, Funded by the German Research Foundation, Director: Prof. Dr. Gunnar Brands, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg Institut für Altertumswissenschaften, Seminar für Orientalische Archäologie und Kunstgeschichte]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Bargen, Friederike., Die Kirchenanlage von Burqush im Hermongebirge und ihre Ausstattung, Institut für Orientalische Archäologie und Kunst (in progress)&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey noted complex substructures, and intended to document the surrounding settlements, [[tomb]]s, [[quarries]] and a [[propylon]] temple ruins. The survey was hampered by the remoteness and altitude of the site, tank shelling, and finding a settlement in the area that was twice as large as expected with numerous rock cut tombs nearby. The basement of the basilica was constructed from bedrock and showed a high technical quality of construction. Traces of bronze [[candle]] holders were found along with remnants of a [[marble]] cover that was white with gray veining. Twelve [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] were recorded in 1903, of which only eight remained in place, with three more displaced nearby, one reused for [[medieval]] farming. The twelfth capital had been covered in rubble and totally obscured. The east wall of the basilica features a [[portico]]. Foundations of what were thought to be a [[peristyle]] for the basilica were found to its north west, some of the area to the north was cleared and leveled by the military.&lt;ref name="brands"/&gt;  The remains of the settlement are dispersed on the east slope of the hill are also large buildings on the west slope.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4275">[[Image:RIC 0001.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Denarius]] of Diva Paulina, Roman Empress, Reg. [[Maximinus I]]]]
'''Caecilia Paulina''' (died in 235/236) was a Roman [[Emperor|Empress]] and consort to Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]], who ruled in 235–238.

==Name==
Her full name, ''Diva Caecilia Paulina Pia [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'', was preserved on an inscription ({{CIL|10|5054}}).&lt;ref&gt;An Epigraphik-Datenbank  Clauss/Slaby
EDCS, [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epigraphikoi_en Latin Inscription Database] search for 'Caecilia Paulina' also returns two results: {{CIL|06|25148}}, and {{CIL|08|02038}}. Accessed 2012-5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; On her coins she is termed simply Diva Paulina. The coins with her inscription were not struck during her life, but some time later, probably after she was [[Divinization (Christian)|deified]]. No sculptural likenesses of her survive.&lt;ref&gt;Knippschild, Silke, Center for Hellenic Studies, review of Eric R. Varner, [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2005/2005-04-10.html Mutilation and Transformation, Damnatio Memoriae and Roman Imperial Portraiture], Leiden: Brill, 2004, pp. 340, {{ISBN|90-04-13577-4}}, ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'', 2005-4-10. Accessed 2012-5-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Almost nothing is known about her life, as ancient writers rarely mentioned her by name. Her husband never set foot in Rome,&lt;ref name="Meckler"&gt;Meckler, Michael, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/maxthrax.htm Maximinus Thrax (235-238 A.D.)], roman-emperors.org. Accessed 2012-5-29.&lt;/ref&gt; thus it is likely that neither did she, at least in her time married to the Emperor. She lived during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], a time of the crumbling and near collapse of the [[Roman Empire]], caused by three simultaneous crises: external invasion, internal civil war, and economic collapse.{{cn|date=August 2018}} While the 4th century historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] wrote about Paulina in his book on the [[Gordian I|Gordian]] emperors, this part of his work was lost, only the sections of his ''History'' covering the period 353–378 are extant. In a later passage, however, Marcellinus refers to the Empress as the good wife of the difficult husband who had:
{{Quote|... led him back into the paths of truth and mercy, by feminine gentleness, as, in recounting the acts of the Gordiani, we have related to have been done by the wife of that truculent emperor Maximinus|Ammianus Marcellinus|''Roman History''&lt;ref&gt;Marcellinus, Ammianus, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_14_book14.htm Roman History], London: Bohn (1862) Book 14. pp.1-45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paulina had one son, [[Gaius Julius Verus Maximus]], appointed Caesar in 236 by his father, but both men were murdered by the soldiers in May 238.&lt;ref name="Meckler"/&gt; Paulina probably died around late 235 or early 236, as Maximus had her deified in 236.&lt;ref name="Meckler" /&gt;

The city of [[Anazarbus]] in [[Cilicia]] struck coins in the name of "Thea Paulina" (the Greek equivalent of "Diva Paulina"), and dated them to the year 254 of that city’s era which converts to 235/236 of the modern calendar. That Paulina is referred to as divine on the coins indicates that she was dead when the coins were produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ansmagazine.com/spring05/provincial.html Roman Provinicial Coins and Imperial Chronology from Elagabalus to Valerian], ansmagazine.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joannes Zonaras]] claims that Maximinus executed his wife, but that accusation is unproven, and improbable if she was deified by her husband.

{{Chola history}}
{{TNhistory}}
The '''Chola dynasty''' was one of the longest-ruling dynasties in history. The earliest datable references to this [[Tamil people|Tamil]] dynasty are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE left by [[Ashoka]], of the [[Maurya Empire]] ([[Ashoka Major Rock Edict No.13]]). As one of the [[Three Crowned Kings]] of [[Tamilakam]], the dynasty continued to govern over varying territory until the 13th century CE.

The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the [[Kaveri River]], but they ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their [[Great power|power]] from the later half of the 9th century till the beginning of the 13th century. The whole country south of the [[Tungabhadra]] was united and held as one state for a period of two centuries and more.&lt;ref name="sastri5"&gt;[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 157&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Rajaraja Chola I]] and his successors [[Rajendra Chola I]], [[Rajadhiraja Chola]], [[Virarajendra Chola]] and [[Kulothunga Chola I]] the dynasty became a military, economic and cultural power in [[South Asia]] and [[South-East Asia]].&lt;ref name=keay215&gt;Keay, p 215&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the [[Ganges]] which [[Rajendra Chola I]] undertook and by the [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya|naval raids]] on cities of the maritime empire of [[Srivijaya]], as well as by the repeated embassies to China.&lt;ref name="sastri158"&gt;[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 158&lt;/ref&gt; The Chola fleet represented the zenith of [[Indian maritime history|ancient Indian sea power]].

During the period 1010–1153, the Chola territories stretched from the islands of the [[Maldives]] in the south to as far north as the banks of the [[Godavari River]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=majumdar407&gt;Majumdar (contains no mention of Maldives)&lt;/ref&gt; Rajaraja Chola conquered peninsular [[South India]], annexed parts of which is now [[Sri Lanka]] and occupied the islands of the Maldives. Rajendra Chola sent a victorious expedition to North India that touched the river [[Ganges]] and defeated the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] ruler of [[Pataliputra]], [[Mahipala]]. He also successfully invaded cities of [[Srivijaya]] of [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=meyer73&gt;Meyer, p 73&lt;/ref&gt; The Chola dynasty went into decline at the beginning of the 13th century with the rise of the [[Pandyan Dynasty]], which ultimately caused their downfall.&lt;ref name=sastri195&gt;[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sastri196&gt;[[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of South India'', p 196&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cholas left a lasting legacy. Their patronage of [[Chola literature|Tamil literature]] and their zeal in the building of temples has resulted in some great works of Tamil literature and architecture.&lt;ref name=keay215/&gt; The Chola kings were avid builders and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as places of worship but also as centres of economic activity.&lt;ref name=geeta20&gt;Vasudevan, pp 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keay, pp 217–218&lt;/ref&gt; They pioneered a centralised form of [[Chola Government|government]] and established a disciplined bureaucracy. The Chola school of art spread to [[Southeast Asia]] and influenced the architecture and art of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Thai Art with Indian Influences by Promsak Jermsawatdi p.57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture by John Stewart Bowman p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The Cholas are also known as the ''Choda''.{{sfnp|Prasad|1988|p=120|ps=}}. The cholas claimed [[Suryavansha]] lineage for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZhnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT209&amp;dq=suryavanshi+cholas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIk-CkxJfdAhXjIjQIHXe4D10Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=suryavanshi%20cholas&amp;f=false| title= The History of India for Children: From Prehistory to the Sultanates, Volume 1| publisher= Shruti Garodia | work= History | date= 1991 | author= Archana Garodia Gupta,  | pages= section 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cc9qCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT252&amp;dq=suryavanshi+cholas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIk-CkxJfdAhXjIjQIHXe4D10Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=suryavanshi%20cholas&amp;f=false| title= From Indus to Independence - A Trek Through Indian History: Vol ..., Volume 3| publisher= Vij Books | work= History | date= 1991 | author= Sanu Kainiraka,  | pages= section 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its antiquity is evident from the mentions in [[Sangam literature|ancient Tamil literature]] and in inscriptions. Later [[medieval Cholas]] also claimed a long and ancient lineage. Mentions in the early [[Sangam period|Sangam]] literature (c. 150 CE){{efn|The age of Sangam is established through the correlation between the evidence on foreign trade found in the poems and the writings by ancient Greek and Romans such as ''Periplus''. [[K.A. Nilakanta Sastri]], ''A History of Cyril and Lulu Charles'', p 106}} indicate that the earliest kings of the dynasty antedated 100 CE. Cholas were mentioned in Ashokan Edicts of 3rd Century BCE as one of the neighboring countries existing in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html|title=KING ASHOKA: His Edicts and His Times|website=www.cs.colostate.edu|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly held view is that ''Chola'' is, like ''[[Chera dynasty|Chera]]'' and ''[[Pandyan dynasty|Pandya]]'', the name of the ruling family or clan of immemorial antiquity. The annotator [[Parimelazhagar]] said: "The charity of people with ancient lineage (such as the Cholas, the Pandyas and the Cheras) are forever generous in spite of their reduced means". Other names in common use for the Cholas are ''Killi'' (கிள்ளி), ''Valavan'' (வளவன்) and ''Sembiyan'' (செம்பியன்). ''Killi'' perhaps comes from the Tamil ''kil'' (கிள்) meaning dig or cleave and conveys the idea of a digger or a worker of the land. This word often forms an integral part of early Chola names like [[Nedunkilli]], [[Nalankilli]] and so on, but almost drops out of use in later times. ''Valavan'' is most probably connected with "''valam''" (வளம்)&amp;nbsp;– fertility and means owner or ruler of a fertile country. ''Sembiyan'' is generally taken to mean a descendant of [[Shibi (king)|Shibi]]&amp;nbsp;– a legendary hero whose self-sacrifice in saving a dove from the pursuit of a falcon figures among the early Chola legends and forms the subject matter of the [[Sibi Jataka]] among the [[Jataka]] stories of [[Buddhism]].{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|pp=19-20|ps=}} In Tamil lexicon ''Chola'' means ''Soazhi'' or ''Saei'' denoting a newly formed kingdom, in the lines of ''Pandya'' or the old country.&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological News
A. L. Frothingham, Jr. ''The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'', Vol. 4, No. 1 (Mar., 1998), pp. 69–125&lt;/ref&gt;

There is very little written evidence available of the Cholas prior to the 7th century. Historic records exist thereafter, including inscriptions on temples. During the past 150 years, historians have gleaned significant knowledge on the subject from a variety of sources such as ancient Tamil Sangam literature, oral traditions, religious texts, temple and [[Copper-plate grant|copperplate inscriptions]]. The main source for the available information of the early Cholas is the early Tamil literature of the Sangam Period.{{efn|The period covered by the Sangam poetry is likely to extend not longer than five or six generations.{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|p=3|ps=}}}} There are also brief notices on the Chola country and its towns, ports and commerce furnished by the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' (''Periplus Maris Erythraei''), and in the slightly later work of the geographer [[Ptolemy]]. ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', a [[Buddhist]] text written down during the 5th century CE, recounts a number of conflicts between the inhabitants of [[Ceylon]] and Cholas in the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture by John Bowman p.401&lt;/ref&gt; Cholas are mentioned in the [[Pillars of Ashoka]] (inscribed 273 BCE–232 BCE) inscriptions, where they are mentioned among the kingdoms which, though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him.{{efn|The Ashokan inscriptions speak of the Cholas in plural, implying that, in his time, there were more than one Chola.{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|p=20|ps=}}}}

==History==
The history of the Cholas falls into four periods: the [[Early Cholas]] of the Sangam literature, the interregnum between the fall of the Sangam Cholas and the rise of the Imperial medieval Cholas under [[Vijayalaya Chola|Vijayalaya]] (c.&amp;nbsp;848), the dynasty of Vijayalaya, and finally the [[Later Chola]] dynasty of Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;I from the third quarter of the 11th century.{{efn|The direct line of Cholas of the Vijayalaya dynasty came to an end with the death of Virarajendra Chola and the assassination of his son [[Athirajendra Chola]]. Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;I, ascended the throne in 1070.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|pp=170-172|ps=}}}}

===Early Cholas===
{{Main| Early Cholas}}
{{further|Legendary early Chola kings}}

The earliest Chola kings for whom there is tangible evidence are mentioned in the Sangam literature. Scholars generally agree that this literature belongs to the second or first few centuries of the [[common era]]. The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled, and at present a connected account of the history of the period cannot be derived.

There is not much information about the transition period of around three centuries from the end of the Sangam age (c.&amp;nbsp;300) to that in which the Pandyas and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] dominated the Tamil country.

[[Epigraphy]] and literature provide few glimpses of the transformations that came over this line of kings during this long interval.

Vijayalaya was the founder of the Imperial Chola dynasty which was the beginning of one of the most splendid empires in Indian history.{{sfnp|Sen|1999|pp=477-478|ps=}} [[Vijayalaya]], possibly a feudatory of the Pallava dynasty, took an opportunity arising out of a conflict between the Pandya dynasty and Pallava dynasty in c.&amp;nbsp;850, captured [[Thanjavur]] from [[Muttarayar]], and established the imperial line of the medieval Chola Dynasty.{{sfnp|Dehejia|1990|p=xiv|ps=}}{{sfnp|Kulke|Rothermund|2001|pp=122–123|ps=}} Thanjavur became the capital of the Imperial Chola Dynasty.{{sfnp|Eraly|2011|p=67|ps=}}

[[File:Raraja detail.png|thumb|left|Detail of the statue of [[Rajaraja Chola]] at [[Brihadisvara Temple]] at [[Thanjavur]].]]

The Chola dynasty was at the peak of its influence and power during the medieval period.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=157|ps=}} Through their leadership and vision, Chola kings expanded their territory and influence. The second Chola King, [[Aditya&amp;nbsp;I]], caused the demise of the Pallava dynasty and defeated the Pandyan dynasty of [[Madurai]] in 885, occupied large parts of the Kannada country, and had marital ties with the Western Ganga dynasty. In 925, his son [[Parantaka&amp;nbsp;I]] conquered Sri Lanka (known as Ilangai). Parantaka I also defeated the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] under Krishna II in the battle of Vallala.{{sfnp|Sen|1999|pp=373|ps=}}

Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;I and Rajendra Chola&amp;nbsp;I were the greatest rulers of the Chola dynasty, extending it beyond the traditional limits of a Tamil kingdom.{{sfnp|Kulke|Rothermund|2001|p=115|ps=}} At its peak, the Chola Empire stretched from the island of Sri Lanka in the south to the Godavari-[[Krishna]] river basin in the north, up to the Konkan coast in Bhatkal, the entire Malabar Coast in addition to [[Lakshadweep]], Maldives, and vast areas of Chera country. Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;I was a ruler with inexhaustible energy, and he applied himself to the task of governance with the same zeal that he had shown in waging wars. He integrated his empire into a tight administrative grid under royal control, and at the same time strengthened local self-government. Therefore, he conducted a land survey in 1000 CE to effectively marshall the resources of his empire.{{sfnp|Eraly|2011|p=68|ps=}} He also built the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in 1010 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Endowments to the Temple|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_cholabt_endowments.asp|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Chalukya Empire]] under [[Satyashraya]] and [[Someshvara I]] tried to wriggle out of Chola domination from time to time, primarily due to the Chola influence in the [[Vengi]] kingdom.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=158|ps=}} The Western Chalukyas mounted several unsuccessful attempts to engage the Chola emperors in war, and except for a brief occupation of Vengi territories between 1118–1126, all their other attempts ended in failure with successive Chola emperors routing the armies of the Chalukyas at various places in many wars. Virarajendra Chola defeated Someshvara II of the Western Chalukya Empire and made an alliance with Prince [[Vikramaditya&amp;nbsp;VI]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient India: Collected Essays on the Literary and Political History of Southern India'' by Sakkottai Krishnaswami Aiyangar p.233&lt;/ref&gt; Cholas always successfully controlled the Chalukyas in the western [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] by defeating them in war and levying tribute on them.{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|pp=107-109|ps=}} Even under the emperors of the Cholas like Kulothunga&amp;nbsp;I and Vikrama Chola, the wars against the Chalukyas were mainly fought in Chalukya territories in Karnataka or in the Telugu country like Vengi, Kakinada, Anantapur, or Gutti. Then the former feudatories like the Hoysalas, Yadvas, and Kakatiyas steadily increased their power and finally replaced the Chalukyas.&lt;ref&gt;ndia: The Most Dangerous Decades by Selig S. Harrison p.31&lt;/ref&gt; With the occupation of Dharwar in North Central Karnataka by the [[Hoysalas]] under [[Vishnuvardhana]], where he based himself with his son Narasimha&amp;nbsp;I in-charge at the Hoysala capital Dwarasamudra around 1149, and with the [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Kalachuris]] occupying the Chalukyan capital for over 35 years from around 1150–1151, the Chalukya kingdom was already starting to dissolve.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=184|ps=}}

The Cholas under [[Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;III]] collaborated to the herald the dissolution of the Chalukyas by aiding Hoysalas under [[Veera Ballala&amp;nbsp;II]], the son-in-law of the Chola monarch, and defeated the Western Chalukyas in a series of wars with [[Someshvara IV]] between 1185–1190. The last Chalukya king's territories did not even include the erstwhile Chalukyan capitals Badami, Manyakheta or Kalyani. That was the final dissolution of Chalukyan power though the Chalukyas existed only in name since 1135–1140. But the Cholas remained stable until 1215, were absorbed by the Pandyan empire and ceased to exist by 1279.{{sfnp|Mukund|2012|p=xlii|ps=}}

On the other hand, throughout the period from 1150–1280, the staunchest opponents of the Cholas were Pandya princes who tried to win independence for their traditional territories. This period saw constant warfare between the Cholas and the Pandyas. The Cholas also fought regular wars with the Eastern [[Gangas]] of [[Kalinganagar|Kalinga]], protected Vengi though it remained largely independent under Chola control, and had domination of the entire eastern coast with their feudatories the Telugu Cholas, Velananti Cholas, Renandu Cholas etc. who also always aided the Cholas in their successful campaigns against the Chalukyas and levying tribute on the Kannada kingdoms and fought constantly with the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalas]], who attempted to overthrow the Chola occupation of [[Lanka]], but until the time of the Later Chola king Kulottunga&amp;nbsp;I the Cholas had firm control over Lanka. A Later Chola king, [[Rajadhiraja Chola&amp;nbsp;II]], was strong enough to prevail over a confederation of five Pandya princes who were aided by their traditional friend, the king of Lanka, this once again gave control of Lanka to the Cholas despite the fact that they were not strong under the resolute Rajadhiraja Chola&amp;nbsp;II. However, his successor, the last great Chola monarch [[Kulottunga Chola&amp;nbsp;III]] reinforced the hold of the Cholas by quelling rebellion and disturbances in Lanka and Madurai, defeated Hoysala generals under Veera Ballala&amp;nbsp;II in Karuvur, in addition to holding on to his traditional territories in Tamil country, Eastern Gangavadi, Draksharama, Vengi and Kalinga. After this, he entered into a marital alliance with Veera Ballala&amp;nbsp;II (with Ballala's marriage to a Chola princess) and his relationship with Hoysalas seems to have become friendlier.{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|pp=107-109|ps=}}{{efn|"After the second Pandya War, Kulottunga undertook a campaign to check to the growth of Hoysala power in that quarter.

===Later Cholas (1070–1279)===
{{Main| Later Cholas }}

Marital and political alliances between the [[Eastern Chalukyas]] began during the reign of Rajaraja following his invasion of Vengi. Rajaraja Chola's daughter married Chalukya prince Vimaladitya{{sfnp|Majumdar|1987|p=405|ps=}} and Rajendra Chola's daughter Ammanga Devi was married to the Eastern Chalukya prince [[Rajaraja Narendra]].{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|p=120|ps=}} Virarajendra Chola's son, [[Athirajendra Chola]], was assassinated in a civil disturbance in 1070, and Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;I, the son of Ammanga Devi and Rajaraja Narendra, ascended the Chola throne. Thus began the Later Chola dynasty.{{sfnp|Majumdar|1987|p=408|ps=}}

The Later Chola dynasty was led by capable rulers such as Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;I, his son [[Vikrama Chola]], other successors like Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;II, Rajadhiraja Chola&amp;nbsp;II, and Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;III, who conquered Kalinga, [[Eelam|Ilam]], and [[Kataha]]. However, the rule of the later Cholas between 1218, starting with [[Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;II]], to the last emperor [[Rajendra Chola&amp;nbsp;III]] was not as strong as those of the emperors between 850–1215. Around 1118, they lost control of Vengi to the Western Chalukya and Gangavadi (southern [[Mysore]] districts) to the [[Hoysala Empire]]. However, these were only temporary setbacks, because immediately following the accession of king Vikrama Chola, the son and successor of Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;I, the Cholas lost no time in recovering the province of Vengi by defeating Chalukya Someshvara III and also recovering Gangavadi from the Hoysalas. The Chola Empire, though not as strong as between 850–1150, was still largely territorially intact under Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;II (1146–1175) a fact attested by the construction and completion of the third grand Chola architectural marvel, the chariot-shaped [[Airavatesvara Temple]] at Dharasuram on the outskirts of modern Kumbakonam. Chola administration and territorial integrity until the rule of Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;III was stable and very prosperous up to 1215, but during his rule itself, the decline of the Chola power started following his defeat by Maravarman Sundara Pandiyan&amp;nbsp;II in 1215–16.{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=471|ps=}} Subsequently, the Cholas also lost control of the island of Lanka and were driven out by the revival of Sinhala power.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Rajaraja mural-2.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Rajaraja Chola]] and his guru Karuvurar at [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]]]]

In continuation of the decline, also marked by the resurgence of the Pandyan dynasty as the most powerful rulers in South India, a lack of a controlling central administration in its erstwhile-Pandyan territories prompted a number of claimants to the Pandya throne to cause a civil war in which the Sinhalas and the Cholas were involved by proxy. Details of the Pandyan civil war and the role played by the Cholas and Sinhalas, are present in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' as well as the Pallavarayanpettai Inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;''South Indian Inscriptions'', Vol. 12&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|pp=128-129|ps=}}

The Cholas, under [[Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;III]] and later, his successor Rajendra Chola&amp;nbsp;III, were quite weak and therefore, experienced continuous trouble. One feudatory, the [[Kadava]] chieftain [[Kopperunchinga&amp;nbsp;I]], even held Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;III as hostage for sometime.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=194|ps=}}{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=472|ps=}} At the close of the 12th century, the growing influence of the Hoysalas replaced the declining Chalukyas as the main player in the Kannada country, but they too faced constant trouble from the Seunas and the Kalachuris, who were occupying Chalukya capital because those empires were their new rivals. So naturally, the Hoysalas found it convenient to have friendly relations with the Cholas from the time of Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;III, who had defeated Hoysala Veera Ballala&amp;nbsp;II, who had subsequent marital relations with the Chola monarch. This continued during the time of Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;III the son and successor of Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;III{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=471|ps=}}{{sfnp|Majumdar|1987|p=410|ps=}}

The Pandyas in the south had risen to the rank of a great power who ultimately banished the Hoysalas from Malanadu or Kannada country, who were allies of the Cholas from Tamil country and the demise of the Cholas themselves ultimately was caused by the Pandyas in 1279. The Pandyas first steadily gained control of the Tamil country as well as territories in Sri Lanka, Chera country, Telugu country under Maravarman Sundara Pandiyan&amp;nbsp;II and his able successor [[Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan]] before inflicting several defeats on the joint forces of the Cholas under Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;III, his successor Rajendra Chola&amp;nbsp;III and the Hoysalas under Someshwara, his son Ramanatha{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=471|ps=}} Rajendra&amp;nbsp;III tried to survive by aligning with the Kadava Pallavas and the Hoysalas in turn in order to counter the constantly rising power of the Pandyans who were the major players in the Tamil country from 1215 and had intelligently consolidated their position in Madurai-Rameswaram-Ilam-Cheranadu and Kanyakumari belt, and had been steadily increasing their territories in the Kaveri belt between Dindigul-Tiruchy-Karur-Satyamangalam as well as in the Kaveri Delta i.e., Thanjavur-Mayuram-Chidambaram-Vriddhachalam-Kanchi, finally marching all the way up to Arcot—Tirumalai-Nellore-Visayawadai-Vengi-Kalingam belt by 1250.&lt;ref&gt;South India and Her Muhammadan Invaders by S.

The Pandyas steadily routed both the Hoysalas and the Cholas.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|pp=195-196|ps=}} They also dispossessed the Hoysalas, by defeating them under Jatavarman Sundara Pandiyan at Kannanur Kuppam.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=196|ps=}} At the close of Rajendra's reign, the Pandyan empire was at the height of prosperity and had taken the place of the Chola empire in the eyes of the foreign observers.{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=485|ps=}} The last recorded date of Rajendra&amp;nbsp;III is 1279.

==Administration and society==

===Chola territory===
{{Main|Chola Nadu}}
According to Tamil tradition, the Chola country comprised the region that includes the modern-day [[Tiruchirapalli District]], [[Tiruvarur District]], [[Nagapattinam District]], [[Ariyalur District]], [[Perambalur district]], [[Pudukkottai district]], [[Thanjavur District]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Karaikal District]]. The river Kaveri and its tributaries dominate this landscape of generally flat country that gradually slopes towards the sea, unbroken by major hills or valleys. The river, which is also known as the ''Ponni'' (''Golden'') river, had a special place in the culture of Cholas. The annual floods in the Kaveri marked an occasion for celebration, known as ''[[Adiperukku]]'', in which the whole nation took part.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Kaveripoompattinam on the coast near the Kaveri delta was a major port town.{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=457|ps=}} Ptolemy knew of this, which he called Khaberis, and the other port town of [[Nagappattinam]] as the most important centres of Cholas.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings, American Philosophical Society'' (1978), vol. 122, No. 6, p 414&lt;/ref&gt; These two towns became hubs of trade and commerce and attracted many religious faiths, including Buddhism.{{efn|The Buddhist work ''Milinda Panha'' dated to the early Christian era, mentions Kolapttna among the best-known sea ports on the Chola coast.{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|p=23|ps=}}}} Roman ships found their way into these ports. Roman coins dating from the early centuries of the common era have been found near the Kaveri delta.{{sfnp|Nagasamy|1981|ps=}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=107|ps=}}

The other major towns were Thanjavur, Uraiyur and Kudanthai, now known as [[Kumbakonam]].{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=457|ps=}} After Rajendra Chola moved his capital to Gangaikonda Cholapuram, Thanjavur lost its importance.{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|p=106|ps=}}

===Government===
{{Main|Chola Government}}
[[File:Chera kingdom, chieftaincies, and Chola mandalams c. 11th century (zoom).svg|thumb|400px|The [[mandalam]]s of the Chola empire, {{circa|11th century}}.{{sfn|Karashima|2014|p=132}}]]

In the age of the Cholas, the whole of South India was for the first time brought under a single government.{{efn|The only other time when peninsular India would be brought under one umbrella before the [[History of the Republic of India|independence of India]] was during the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] (1336–1614).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}}}

The Cholas' system of government was monarchical, as in the Sangam age.{{sfnp|Kulke|Rothermund|2001|p=104|ps=}} However, there was little in common between the local chiefdoms of the earlier period and the imperial-like states of Rajaraja Chola and his successors.{{sfnp|Stein|1998|p=26|ps=}} Aside from the early capital at Thanjavur and the later on at Gangaikonda Cholapuram, Kanchipuram and Madurai were considered to be regional capitals in which occasional courts were held. The king was the supreme leader and a benevolent authoritarian. His administrative role consisted of issuing oral commands to responsible officers when representations were made to him. Due to the lack of a legislature or a legislative system in the modern sense, the fairness of king's orders dependent on his morality and belief in ''Dharma''. The Chola kings built temples and endowed them with great wealth. The temples acted not only as places of worship but also as centres of economic activity, benefiting the community as a whole.{{sfnp|Vasudevan|2003|pp=20-22|ps=}} Some of the output of villages throughout the kingdom was given to temples that reinvested some of the wealth accumulated as loans to the settlements.&lt;ref&gt;A Global History of Architecture by Francis D. K. Ching, Mark M. Jarzombek, Vikramaditya Prakash p.338&lt;/ref&gt; The Chola Dynasty was divided into several provinces called [[Mandalam]]s which were further divided into Valanadus and these Valanadus were sub-divided into units called Kottams or Kutrams.&lt;ref&gt;History of India by N. Jayapalan p.171 {{ISBN|81-7156-914-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Kathleen Gough]], during the Chola period the [[Vellalar]] were the "dominant secular aristocratic caste&amp;nbsp;... providing the courtiers, most of the army officers, the lower ranks of the kingdom's bureaucracy, and the upper layer of the peasantry".{{sfnp|Gough|2008|p=29|ps=}}

Before the reign of Rajaraja Chola I huge parts of the Chola territory were ruled by hereditary lords and local princes who were in a loose alliance with the Chola rulers. Thereafter, until the reign of Vikrama Chola in 1133 CE when the Chola power was at its peak, these hereditary lords and local princes virtually vanished from the Chola records and were either replaced or turned into dependent officials. Through these dependent officials the administration was improved and the Chola kings were able to exercise a closer control over the different parts of the empire.{{sfnp|Talbot|2001|p=172}} There was an expansion of the administrative structure, particularly from the reign of Rajaraja Chola I onwards. The government at this time had a large land revenue department, consisting of several tiers, which was largely concerned with maintaining accounts. The assessment and collection of revenue were undertaken by corporate bodies such as the ur, nadu, sabha, nagaram and sometimes by local chieftains who passed the revenue to the centre. During the reign of Rajaraja Chola I, the state initiated a massive project of land survey and assessment and there was a reorganisation of the empire into units known as valanadus.{{sfnp|Singh|2008|p=590|ps=}}

The order of the King was first communicated by the executive officer to the local authorities. Afterwards the records of the transaction was drawn up and attested by a number of witnesses who were either local magnates or government officers.&lt;ref name="India p.77"&gt;''Administrative System in India: Vedic Age to 1947'' by U.&amp;nbsp;B. Singh p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

At local government level, every village was a self-governing unit. A number of villages constituted a larger entity known as a ''Kurram'', ''Nadu'' or ''Kottam'', depending on the area.{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|pp=474-475|ps=}}{{sfnp|Stein|1998|p=20|ps=}}{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=185|ps=}} A number of ''Kurrams'' constituted a ''valanadu''.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=150|ps=}} These structures underwent constant change and refinement throughout the Chola period.{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|p=465|ps=}}

Justice was mostly a local matter in the Chola Empire; minor disputes were settled at the village level.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=185|ps=}} Punishment for minor crimes were in the form of fines or a direction for the offender to donate to some charitable endowment. Even crimes such as manslaughter or murder were punished with fines. Crimes of the state, such as treason, were heard and decided by the king himself; the typical punishment in these cases was either execution or confiscation of property.{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|p=477|ps=}}

===Military===
The Chola dynasty had a professional military, of which the king was the supreme commander. It had four elements, comprising the cavalry, the elephant corps, several divisions of infantry and a navy.{{sfnp|Sakhuja|Sakhuja|2009|p=88|ps=}} There were regiments of bowmen and swordsmen while the swordsmen were the most permanent and dependable troops. The Chola army was spread all over the country and was stationed in local garrisons or military camps known as ''Kodagams''. The elephants played a major role in the army and the dynasty had numerous [[war elephant]]s. These carried houses or huge Howdahs on their backs, full of soldiers who shot arrows at long range and who fought with spears at close quarters.{{sfnp|Barua|2005|p=18|ps=}}

The Chola rulers built several palaces and fortifications to protect their cities. The fortifications were mostly made up of bricks but other materials like stone, wood and mud were also used.{{sfnp|Dehejia|1990|p=79|ps=}}{{sfnp|Subbarayalu|2009|pp=97-99|ps=}} According to the ancient Tamil text ''Silappadikaram'', the Tamil kings defended their forts with catapults that threw stones, huge cauldrons of boiling water or molten lead, and hooks, chains and traps.{{sfnp|Eraly|2011|p=176|ps=}}{{sfnp|Rajasuriar|1998|p=15|ps=}}{{qn|date=April 2015}}

The soldiers of the Chola dynasty used weapons such as swords, bows, javelins, spears and shields which were made up of steel.{{sfnp|Sen|1999|p=205|ps=}} Particularly the famous [[Wootz steel]], which has a long history in south India dating back to the period before the Christian era, seems also be used to produce weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Technology and Society by Menon R.V.G. p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The army consisted of people from different castes but the warriors of the [[Kaikolar]] and [[Vellalar]] castes played a prominent role.{{sfnp|Stein|1980|p=130|ps=}}{{Sfnp|Lucassen|Lucassen|2014|p=120|ps=}}

The [[Chola navy]] was the zenith of ancient India sea power.{{sfnp|Barua|2005|p=18|ps=}} It played a vital role in the expansion of the empire, including the conquest of the Ceylon islands and naval raids on Srivijaya.&lt;ref&gt;The State at War in South Asia by Pradeep Barua p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The navy grew both in size and status during the medieval Cholas reign. The Chola admirals commanded much respect and prestige. The navy commanders also acted as diplomats in some instances. From 900 to 1100, the navy had grown from a small backwater entity to that of a potent power projection and diplomatic symbol in all of Asia, but was gradually reduced in significance when the Cholas fought land battles subjugating the Chalukyas of the Andhra-Kannada area in South India.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=175|ps=}}

A martial art called ''[[Silambam]]'' was patronised by the Chola rulers. Ancient and medieval Tamil texts mention different forms of martial traditions but the ultimate expression of the loyalty of the warrior to his commander was a form of martial suicide called ''Navakandam''. The medieval ''Kalingathu Parani'' text, which celebrates the victory of Kulothunga Chola I and his general in the battle for Kalinga, describes the practice in detail.

===Economy===
Land revenue and trade tax were the main source of income.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pearson General Studies Manual'' 2009, 1/e by Showick Thorpe Edgar Thorpe p.59&lt;/ref&gt;
The Chola rulers issued their coins in gold, silver and copper.{{sfnp|Singh|2008|p=54|ps=}} The Chola economy was based on three tiers—at the local level, agricultural settlements formed the foundation to commercial towns nagaram, which acted as redistribution centres for externally produced items bound for consumption in the local economy and as sources of products made by nagaram artisans for the international trade. At the top of this economic pyramid were the elite merchant groups (''samayam'') who organised and dominated the regions international maritime trade.{{sfnp|Schmidt|1995|p=32|ps=}}{{clarify|reason=so what was the middle tier?|date=April 2015}}

One of the main articles which were exported to foreign countries were cotton cloth.{{sfnp|Devare|2009|p=179|ps=}} Uraiyur, the capital of the early Chola rulers, was a famous centre for cotton textiles which were praised by Tamil poets.{{sfnp|Eraly|2011|p=208|ps=}}{{sfnp|Ramaswamy|2007|p=20|ps=}} The Chola rulers actively encouraged the weaving industry and derived revenue from it.{{sfnp|Singh|2008|p=599|ps=}} During this period the weavers started to organise themselves into guilds.&lt;ref&gt;''Trade and Politics on the Coromandel Coast: Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth centuries'' by Radhika Seshan p.18&lt;/ref&gt; The weavers had their own residential sector in all towns. The most important weaving communities in early medieval times were the [[Saliya]]r and [[Kaikolar]].{{sfnp|Singh|2008|p=599|ps=}} During the Chola period silk weaving attained a high degree and [[Kanchipuram]] became one of the main centres for silk.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Textiles: Past and Present'' by G. K. Ghosh, Shukla Ghosh p.123-124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kanchipuram: Land of Legends, Saints and Temples'' by P. V. L. Narasimha Rao p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal crafts reached its zenith during the 10th to 11th centuries because the Chola rulers like Chembian Maadevi extended their patronage to metal craftsmen.{{sfnp|Ramaswamy|2007|p=51|ps=}} Wootz steel was a major export item.{{sfnp|Mukherjee|2011|p=105|ps=}}

The farmers occupied one of the highest positions in society.&lt;ref name="Their Environs p.319"&gt;''History of People and Their Environs: Essays in Honour of Prof. B.S. Chandrababu'' by S.Ganeshram p.319&lt;/ref&gt; These were the Vellalar community who formed the nobility or the landed aristocracy of the country and who were economically a powerful group.&lt;ref name="Their Environs p.319"/&gt;{{sfnp|Singh|2008|p=592|ps=}} Agriculture was the principal occupation for many people. Besides the landowners, there were others dependent on agriculture.{{sfnp|Sen|1999|pp=490-492|ps=}} The Vellalar community was the dominant secular aristocratic caste under the Chola rulers, providing the courtiers, most of the army officers, the lower ranks of the bureaucracy and the upper layer of the peasantry.{{sfnp|Gough|2008|p=29|ps=}}

In almost all villages the distinction between persons paying the land-tax (iraikudigal) and those who did not was clearly established. There was a class of hired day-labourers who assisted in agricultural operations on the estates of other people and received a daily wage. All cultivable land was held in one of the three broad classes of tenure which can be distinguished as peasant proprietorship called vellan-vagai, service tenure and eleemosynary tenure resulting from charitable gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Indian History by Reddy p.B57&lt;/ref&gt; The vellan-vagai was the ordinary [[ryotwari]] village of modern times, having direct relations with the government and paying a land-tax liable to revision from time to time.{{sfnp|Schmidt|1995|p=32|ps=}} The vellan-vagai villages fell into two broad classes- one directly remitting a variable annual revenue to the state and the other paying dues of a more or less fixed character to the public
institutions like temples to which they were assigned.{{sfnp|Mukund|1999|pp=30-32|ps=}} The prosperity of an agricultural country depends to a large extent on the facilities provided for irrigation. Apart from sinking wells and excavating tanks, the Chola rulers threw mighty stone dams across the Kaveri and other rivers, and cut out channels to distribute water over large tracts of land.{{sfnp|Ramaswamy|2007|p=86|ps=}} Rajendra Chola&amp;nbsp;I dug near his capital an artificial lake, which was filled with water from the Kolerun and the Vellar rivers.{{sfnp|Mukund|1999|pp=30-32|ps=}}

There existed a brisk internal trade in several articles carried on by the organised mercantile corporations in various parts of the country. The metal industries and the jewellers art had reached a high degree of excellence. The manufacture of sea-salt was carried on under government supervision and control. Trade was carried on by merchants organised in guilds. The guilds described sometimes by the terms nanadesis were a powerful autonomous corporation of merchants which visited different countries in the course of their trade. They had their own mercenary army for the protection of their merchandise. There were also local organisations of merchants called "''nagaram''" in big centres of trade like Kanchipuram and Mamallapuram.{{sfnp|Rothermund|1993|p=9|ps=}}{{sfnp|Mukund|1999|pp=30-32|ps=}}

===Hospitals===
Hospitals were maintained by the Chola kings, whose government gave lands for that purpose. The Tirumukkudal inscription shows that a hospital was named after Vira Chola. Many diseases were cured by the doctors of the hospital, which was under the control of a chief physician who was paid annually 80 Kalams of paddy, 8 Kasus and a grant of land. Apart from the doctors, other remunerated staff included a nurse, barber (who performed minor operations) and a waterman.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Economic History of India'' by N. Jayapalan p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chola queen Kundavai also established a hospital at Tanjavur and gave land for the perpetual maintenance of it.&lt;ref&gt;Temple art under the Chola queens by Balasubrahmanyam Venkataraman p.72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Temple Art Under the Chola Queens'' by Balasubrahmanyam Venkataraman p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
During the Chola period several guilds, communities and castes emerged. The guild was one of the most significant institutions of south India and merchants organised themselves into guilds. The best known of these were the Manigramam and Ayyavole guilds though other guilds such as Anjuvannam and Valanjiyar were also in existence.{{sfnp|Mukund|1999|p=29-30|ps=}} The farmers occupied one of the highest positions in society. These were the Vellalar community who formed the nobility or the landed aristocracy of the country and who were economically a powerful group.&lt;ref name="Their Environs p.319"/&gt;{{sfnp|Singh|2008|p=592|ps=}} The Vellalar community was the dominant secular aristocratic caste under the Chola rulers, providing the courtiers, most of the army officers, the lower ranks of the bureaucracy and the upper layer of the peasantry.{{sfnp|Gough|2008|p=29|ps=}} The Vellalar were also sent to northern Sri Lanka by the Chola rulers as settlers.{{sfnp|Hellmann-Rajanayagam|2004|p=104|ps=}} The Ulavar community were working in the field which was associated with agriculture and the peasants were known as Kalamar.&lt;ref name="Their Environs p.319"/&gt;

The [[Kaikolar]] community were weavers and merchants but they also maintained armies. During the Chola period they had predominant trading and military roles.&lt;ref name="Craft Production p.188"&gt;''The Political Economy of Craft Production: Crafting Empire in South India'', by Carla M. Sinopoli p.188&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the Imperial Chola rulers (10th-13th century) there were major changes in the temple administration and land ownership. There was more involvement of non-Brahmin elements in the temple administration. This can be attributed to the shift in money power. Skilled classes like the weavers and the merchant-class had become prosperous. Land ownership was no longer a privilege of the Brahmins (priest caste) and the Vellalar land owners.{{sfnp|Sadarangani|2004|p=16|ps=}}

There is little information on the size and the density of the population during the Chola reign{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=284|ps=}} The stability in the core Chola region enabled the people to lead a productive and contented life. However, there were reports of widespread famine caused by natural calamities.{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|pp=125, 129|ps=}}

The quality of the inscriptions of the regime indicates a high level of literacy and education. The text in these inscriptions was written by court poets and engraved by talented artisans. Education in the contemporary sense was not considered important; there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that some village councils organised schools to teach the basics of reading and writing to children,{{sfnp|Scharfe|2002|p=180|ps=}} although there is no evidence of systematic educational system for the masses.&lt;ref&gt;17th century Italian traveler [[Pietro Della Valle]] (1623) has given a vivid account of the village schools in South India. These accounts reflect the system of primary education in existence until the morder times in Tamil Nadu&lt;/ref&gt; Vocational education was through hereditary training in which the father passed on his skills to his sons. Tamil was the medium of education for the masses; Religious monasteries (''matha'' or ''gatika'') were centres of learning and received government support.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=293|ps=}}

===Foreign trade===
{{See also|Chola Navy |Relationship of the Cholas with the Chinese}}

The Cholas excelled in foreign trade and maritime activity, extending their influence overseas to China and Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Kulke|Rothermund|2001|pp=116-117|ps=}} Towards the end of the 9th century, southern India had developed extensive maritime and commercial activity.{{sfnp|Kulke|Rothermund|2001|pp=12, 118|ps=}} The south Indian guilds played a major role in interregional and overseas trade. The best known of these were the Manigramam and Ayyavole guilds who followed the conquering Chola armies.{{sfnp|Mukund|1999|p=29-30|ps=}} The encouragement by the Chola court furthered the expansion of Tamil merchant associations such as the Ayyavole and Manigramam guilds into Southeast Asia and China.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism, Diplomacy, and Trade: The Realignment of Sino-Indian Relations by Tansen Sen p.159&lt;/ref&gt; The Cholas, being in possession of parts of both the west and the east coasts of peninsular India, were at the forefront of these ventures.{{sfnp|Kulke|Rothermund|2001|p=124|ps=}}{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|pp=465, 477|ps=}} The [[Tang dynasty]] of China, the Srivijaya empire under the Sailendras, and the [[Abbasid]] Kalifat at [[Baghdad]] were the main trading partners.{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|p=604|ps=}}

Some credit for the emergence of a world market must also go to the dynasty. It played a significant role in linking the markets of China to the rest of the world. The market structure and economic policies of the Chola dynasty were more conducive to a large-scale, cross-regional market trade than those enacted by the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]]. A Chola record gives their rationale for engagement in foreign trade: "Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants and good horses attach to yourself by providing them with villages and decent dwellings in the city, by affording them daily audience, presents and allowing them profits. Then those articles will never go to your enemies."&lt;ref name="Buddhism, Diplomacy p.156"&gt;''Buddhism, Diplomacy, and Trade: The Realignment of Sino-Indian Relations'' by Tansen Sen p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

Song dynasty reports record that an embassy from ''Chulian'' (Chola) reached the Chinese court in 1077,{{sfnp|Kulke|Rothermund|2001|p=117|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thapar|1995|p=xv|ps=}} and that the king of the Chulian at the time, Kulothunga I, was called ''Ti-hua-kia-lo''. This embassy was a trading venture and was highly profitable to the visitors, who returned with copper coins in exchange for articles of [[tribute]], including glass and spices.{{sfnp|Mukund|2012|p=92|ps=}} Probably, the motive behind Rajendra's expedition to Srivijaya was the protection of the merchants' interests.{{sfnp|Mukund|2012|p=95|ps=}}

===Canals and water tanks===
There was tremendous agrarian expansion during the rule of the imperial Chola Dynasty (c.&amp;nbsp;900-1270 AD) all over Tamil Nadu and particularly in the Kaveri Basin. Most of the canals of the Kaveri River belongs to this period e.g., Uyyakondan canal, Rajendran vaykkal, Sembian Mahadegvi vaykkal. There was a well-developed and highly efficient system of water management from the village level upwards. The increase in the royal patronage and also the number of devadana and bramadeya lands which increased the role of the temples and village assemblies in the field. Committees like eri-variyam(tank-committee) and totta-variam(garden committees) were active as also the temples with their vast resources in land, men and money. The water tanks that came up during the Chola period are too many to be listed here. But a few most outstanding may be briefly mentioned. Rajendra Chola built a huge tank named Solagangam in his capital city Gangaikonda Solapuram and was described as the liquid pillar of victory. About 16 miles long, it was provided with sluices and canals for irrigating the lands in the neighbouring areas. Another very large lake of this period, which even today seems an important source of irrigation was the Viranameri near Kattumannarkoil in South Arcot district founded by Parantaka Chola. Other famous lakes of this period are Madurantakam, Sundra-cholapereri, Kundavai-Pereri (after a Chola queen).&lt;ref&gt;''History of Agriculture in India, Up to c.&amp;nbsp;1200 A.D.'' by Lallanji Gopal p.501&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Cholas, the Tamil country reached new heights of excellence in [[art]], [[religion]], [[music]] and [[literature]].{{sfnp|Mitter|2001|p=2|ps=}} In all of these spheres, the Chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun in an earlier age under the Pallavas.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=418|ps=}} Monumental architecture in the form of majestic [[temples]] and [[sculpture]] in stone and [[bronze]] reached a finesse never before achieved in India.{{sfnp|Thapar|1995|p=403|ps= Quote: "It was, however, in bronze sculptures that the Chola craftsmen excelled, producing images rivalling the best anywhere."}}

The Chola conquest of Kadaram (Kedah) and Srivijaya, and their continued commercial contacts with the [[Mid-Imperial China|Chinese Empire]], enabled them to influence the local cultures.{{sfnp|Kulke|Rothermund|2001|p=159|ps=}} Examples of the [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu cultural influence]] found today throughout the Southeast Asia owe much to the legacy of the Cholas.

The template for these and future temples was formulated by Aditya&amp;nbsp;I and Parantaka.{{sfnp|Dehejia|1990|p=10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Harle|1994|p=295|ps=}}{{sfnp|Mitter|2001|p=57|ps=}} The Chola temple architecture has been appreciated for its magnificence as well as delicate workmanship, ostensibly following the rich traditions of the past bequeathed to them by the Pallava Dynasty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''Temples of South India'' by V.&amp;nbsp;V. Subba Reddy p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural historian [[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]] says that "the Chola artists conceived like giants and finished like jewelers".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; A new development in Chola art that characterised the Dravidian architecture in later times was the addition of a huge gateway called gopuram to the enclosure of the temple, which had gradually taken its form and attained maturity under the Pandya Dynasty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The Chola school of art also spread to Southeast Asia and influenced the architecture and art of Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Jermsawatdi|1979|p=57|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture'' by John Stewart Bowman p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple building received great impetus from the conquests and the genius of Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola&amp;nbsp;I.{{sfnp|Vasudevan|2003|pp=21-24|ps=}} The maturity and grandeur to which the Chola architecture had evolved found expression in the two temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram. The magnificent [[Brihadisvara Temple|Shiva temple of Thanjavur]], completed around 1009, is a fitting memorial to the material achievements of the time of Rajaraja. The largest and tallest of all Indian temples of its time, it is at the apex of South Indian architecture. The temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram at [[Gangaikondacholapuram]], the creation of Rajendra Chola, was intended to excel its predecessor. Completed around 1030, only two decades after the temple at Thanjavur and in the same style, the greater elaboration in its appearance attests the more affluent state of the Chola Empire under Rajendra.{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=479|ps=}}{{sfnp|Nagasamy|1970|p=|ps=}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}} The Brihadisvara Temple, the temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram and the [[Airavatesvara Temple]] at [[Darasuram]] were declared as [[World Heritage Site]]s by the [[UNESCO]] and are referred to as the [[Great Living Chola Temples|Great living Chola temples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/250 |title=Great Living Chola Temples |publisher=[[UNESCO]]| accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes.{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|p=186|ps=}}{{sfnp|Mitter|2001|p=163|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thapar|1995|p=309-310|ps=}} Among the existing specimens in museums around the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Shiva in various forms, such as [[Vishnu]] and his consort [[Lakshmi]], and the Shaivite saints.{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=479|ps=}} Though conforming generally to the iconographic conventions established by long tradition, the sculptors worked with great freedom in the 11th and the 12th centuries to achieve a classic grace and grandeur. The best example of this can be seen in the form of [[Nataraja]] the Divine Dancer.{{sfnp|Wolpert|1999|p=174|ps=}}{{efn|By common consent, the finest Chola masterpieces are the bronze images of Siva Nataraja.{{sfnp|Mitter|2001|p=59|ps=}}}}

===Literature===
{{Main| Chola literature}}
[[File:Cholacrop.jpg|thumb|Chola bronze from the [[Ulster Museum]]]]

The Imperial Chola era was the golden age of Tamil culture, marked by the importance of literature. Chola records cite many works, including the ''Rajarajesvara Natakam'', ''Viranukkaviyam'' and ''Kannivana Puranam''.{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|pp=663-664|ps=}}

The revival of Hinduism from its nadir during the Kalabhras spurred the construction of numerous temples and these in turn generated Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional literature.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=333|ps=}} Jain and Buddhist authors flourished as well, although in fewer numbers than in previous centuries.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=339|ps=}} ''[[Jivaka-chintamani]]'' by [[Tirutakkatevar]] and ''Sulamani'' by Tolamoli are among notable works by non-Hindu authors.{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|p=188|ps=}}{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|pp=339-340|ps=}}{{sfnp|Ismail|1988|p=1195|ps=}} The grammarian [[Buddhamitra]] wrote a text on Tamil grammar called ''Virasoliyam''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient India: Collected Essays on the Literary and Political History of southern India'' by Sakkottai Krishnaswami Aiyangar p.127&lt;/ref&gt; Commentaries were written on the great text ''Tolkāppiyam'' which deals with grammar but which also mentions ethics of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' by Roland Greene, Stephen Cushman, Clare Cavanagh, Jahan Ramazani, Paul F. Rouzer, Harris Feinsod, David Marno, Alexandra Slessarev p.1410&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Singh|2008|p=27|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;''Portraits of a Nation: History of Ancient India'', by Kamlesh Kapur p.617&lt;/ref&gt; ''Periapuranam'' was another remarkable literary piece of this period. This work is in a sense a national epic of the Tamil people because it treats of the lives of the saints who lived in all parts of Tamil Nadu and belonged to all classes of society, men and women, high and low, educated and uneducated.&lt;ref name="Kulwant Rai Gupta p.288"&gt;''Concise Encyclopaedia Of India'' by Kulwant Rai Gupta, Amita Gupta p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kamban]] flourished during the reign of Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;III. His ''[[Ramavataram]]'' (also referred to as ''Kambaramayanam'') is an epic of Tamil literature, and although the author states that he followed [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'', it is generally accepted that his work is not a simple translation or adaptation of the Sanskrit epic.&lt;ref name="Legend of Ram"&gt;''Legend of Ram'' By Sanujit Ghose&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2015}} He imports into his narration the colour and landscape of his own time; his description of [[Kosala]] is an idealised account of the features of the Chola country.{{sfnp|Ismail|1988|p=1195|ps=}}&lt;ref name="Rays and Ways of Indian Culture"&gt;''Rays and Ways of Indian Culture'' By D. P. Dubey&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2015}}{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|p=116|ps=}}

[[Jayamkondar]]'s masterpiece, ''Kalingattuparani'', is an example of narrative poetry that draws a clear boundary between history and fictitious conventions. This describes the events during Kulothunga Chola I's war in Kalinga and depicts not only the pomp and circumstance of war, but the gruesome details of the field.{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|p=116|ps=}}{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|pp=20, 340-341|ps=}} The Tamil poet [[Ottakoothar|Ottakuttan]] was a contemporary of Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;I and served at the courts of three of Kulothunga's successors.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|pp=184, 340|ps=}}{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|p=20|ps=}} Ottakuttan wrote ''Kulothunga Cholan Ula'', a poem extolling the virtues of the Chola king.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Indian literature, vol. 1'', p 307&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nannul'' is a Chola era work on Tamil grammar. It discusses all five branches of grammar and, according to Berthold Spuler, is still relevant today and is one of the most distinguished normative grammars of literary Tamil.{{sfnp|Spuler|1975|p=194|ps=}}

Of the devotional literature, the arrangement of the Shaivite canon into eleven books was the work of Nambi Andar Nambi, who lived close to the end of the 10th century.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|pp=342-343|ps=}}{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|p=115|ps=}} However, relatively few Vaishnavite works were composed during the Later Chola period, possibly because of the rulers' apparent animosity towards them.{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|p=681|ps=}}

===Cultural centres===
Chola rulers took an active interest in the development of temple centres and used the temples to widen the sphere of their royal authority. They established educational institutions and hospitals around the temple, enhanced the beneficial aspects of the role of the temple, and projected the royalty as a very powerful and genial presence.{{sfnp|Sadarangani|2004|p=15|ps=}} A record of Virarajendra Chola's reign relates to the maintenance of a school in the Jananamandapa within the temple for the study of the Vedas, Sastras, Grammar, and Rupavatara, as well as a hostel for students. The students were provided with food, bathing oil on Saturdays, and oil for pups.{{clarify|reason=oil for young dogs? or is this a typo for "cups"? or what?|date=April 2015}} A hospital named Virasolan was provided with fifteen beds for sick people. The items of expense set apart for their comforts are rice, a doctor, a surgeon, two maid servants for nursing the patients, and a general servant for the hospital.&lt;ref name="South Indian Shrines P. V"&gt;''South Indian Shrines'', Illustrated by P. V. Jagadisa Ayyar p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:NatarajaMET.JPG|thumb|left|220px|[[Bronze]] [[Chola]] Statue of ''[[Nataraja]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City]]

In general, Cholas were followers of Hinduism. They were not swayed by the rise of Buddhism and [[Jainism]] as were the kings of the Pallava and Pandya dynasties. Kocengannan, an Early Chola, was celebrated in both Sangam literature and in the Shaivite canon as a Hindu saint.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=116|ps=}}

While the Cholas did build their largest and most important temple dedicated to [[Shiva]], it can be by no means concluded that either they were followers of Shaivism only or that they were not favourably disposed to other faiths. This is borne out by the fact that the second Chola king, Aditya&amp;nbsp;I  (871–903 CE), built temples for Shiva and also for Vishnu. Inscriptions of 890 refer to his contributions to the construction of the Ranganatha Temple at [[Srirangapatnam]] in the country of the Western Gangas, who were both his feudatories and had connections by marriage with him. He also pronounced that the great temples of Shiva and the Ranganatha temple were to be the ''Kuladhanam'' of the Chola emperors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/darasuram/kulottunga.html Darasuram Temple Inscriptions @]. Whatisindia.com (2007-01-29). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parantaka&amp;nbsp;II was a devotee of the reclining Vishnu (Vadivu Azhagiya Nambi) at Anbil, on the banks of the Kaveri river on the outskirts of Tiruchy, to whom he gave numerous gifts and embellishments. He also prayed before him before his embarking on war to regain the territories in and around Kanchi and Arcot from the waning Rashtrakutas and while leading expeditions against both Madurai and Ilam (Sri Lanka).{{sfnp|Tripathi|1967|p=480|ps=}} Parantaka&amp;nbsp;I and Parantaka Chola II endowed and built temples for Shiva and Vishnu.{{sfnp|Vasudevan|2003|p=102|ps=}} Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;I patronised Buddhists and provided for the construction of the [[Chudamani Vihara]], a Buddhist monastery in [[Nagapattinam]], at the request of Sri Chulamanivarman, the Srivijaya Sailendra king.{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|p=214|ps=}}{{sfnp|Majumdar|1987|p=4067|ps=}}

During the period of the Later Cholas, there are alleged to have been instances of intolerance towards Vaishnavites{{sfnp|Stein|1998|p=134|ps=}} especially towards their acharya, [[Ramanuja]].{{sfnp|Vasudevan|2003|p=104|ps=}} [[Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;II]], a staunch Shaivite, is said to have removed a statue of Vishnu from the Shiva temple at Chidambaram, though there are no epigraphical evidences to support this theory. There is an inscription from 1160 that the custodians of Shiva temples who had social intercourses with Vaishnavites would forfeit their property. However, this is more of a direction to the Shaivite community by its religious heads than any kind of dictat by a Chola emperor. While Chola kings built their largest temples for Shiva and even while emperors like Rajaraja Chola&amp;nbsp;I held titles like ''Sivapadasekharan'', in none of their inscriptions did the Chola emperors proclaim that their clan only and solely followed Shaivism or that Shaivism was the state religion during their rule.{{sfnp|Sastri|2002|p=176|ps=}}{{sfnp|Sastri|1984|p=645|ps=}}{{sfnp|Chopra|Ravindran|Subrahmanian|2003|p=126|ps=}}

==In popular culture==
[[File:StandingHanumanCholaDynasty11thCentury.jpg|thumb|Standing [[Hanuman]], Chola Dynasty, 11th century.]]
The Chola dynasty has inspired many Tamil authors.{{sfnp|Das|1995|p=108|ps=}} The most important work of this genre is the popular ''[[Ponniyin Selvan]]'' (The son of ''Ponni''), a historical novel in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] written by [[Kalki Krishnamurthy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Versatile writer and patriot |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/03/20/stories/13200178.htm |work=The Hindu |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in five volumes, this narrates the story of Rajaraja Chola, dealing with the events leading up to the ascension of [[Uttama Chola]] to the Chola throne. Kalki had used the confusion in the succession to the Chola throne after the demise of Parantaka Chola&amp;nbsp;II.{{sfnp|Das|1995|pp=108-109|ps=}} The book was serialised in the Tamil periodical ''[[Kalki (Tamil magazine)|Kalki]]'' during the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=English translation of Ponniyin Selvan |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/lr/2003/01/05/stories/2003010500100100.htm |work=The Hindu |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serialisation lasted for nearly five years and every week its publication was awaited with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lines that Speak |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/07/23/stories/13230766.htm |work=The Hindu |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalki's earlier historical romance, ''[[Parthiban Kanavu]]'', deals with the fortunes of the imaginary Chola prince Vikraman, who was supposed to have lived as a feudatory of the Pallava king [[Narasimhavarman&amp;nbsp;I]] during the 7th century. The period of the story lies within the interregnum during which the Cholas were in decline before Vijayalaya Chola revived their fortunes.{{sfnp|Das|1995|p=109|ps=}} ''Parthiban Kanavu'' was also serialised in the ''Kalki'' weekly during the early 1950s.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Sandilyan]], another popular Tamil novelist, wrote ''Kadal Pura'' in the 1960s. It was serialised in the Tamil weekly ''[[Kumudam]]''. ''Kadal Pura'' is set during the period when Kulothunga Chola&amp;nbsp;I was in exile from the Vengi kingdom after he was denied the throne. It speculates the whereabouts of Kulothunga during this period. Sandilyan's earlier work, ''[[Yavana Rani]]'', written in the early 1960s, is based on the life of Karikala Chola.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, vol. 1'', pp 631–632&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Balakumaran]] wrote the novel ''[[Udayar (novel)|Udaiyar]]'', which is based on the circumstances surrounding Rajaraja Chola's construction of the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Book review of Udaiyar|author=|url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2005/02/22/stories/2005022200101501.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2008-05-30|location=Chennai, India|date=2005-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were stage productions based on the life of Rajaraja Chola during the 1950s and in 1973 [[Sivaji Ganesan]] acted in a screen adaptation of a play titled ''[[Rajaraja Cholan]]''. The Cholas are featured in the [[History of the World (board game)|History of the World]] board game, produced by [[Avalon Hill]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The Cholas were the subject of the 2010 Tamil-language movie ''[[Aayirathil Oruvan (2010 film)|Aayirathil Oruvan]]''.

'''''Christian Order''''' is a British-based monthly magazine for [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianorder.com/index.html ''Christian Order''] official website&lt;/ref&gt; which was described by John Beaumont of ''Fidelity'' magazine in 1996 as "most influential of the conservative Catholic journals in the United Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sspx.agenda.tripod.com/id23.html "The Vanishing Schism Revisited"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514061547/http://sspx.agenda.tripod.com/id23.html |date=14 May 2008 }}, by John Beaumont, ''Fidelity'' magazine, November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally devoted to the Catholic response to social issues, taking a [[distributist]] stance sceptical of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/86 "Faith and Community Threatened? Roman Catholic Responses to the Welfare State, Materialism and Social Mobility, 1945–62"] by Joan Keating, ''Twentieth Century History'', Volume 9, Number 1, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s a number of contributors were attracted such as George Telford (former vice-chairman and Secretary to the Catechetical Commission of the Bishops of England and Wales)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelusonline.org/print.php?sid=2976 "The Kingship of Christ Since Vatican II"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by Michael Davies, ''[[The Angelus (magazine)|The Angelus]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the lay author [[Michael Davies (Catholic writer)|Michael Davies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifuv.org/docs/michaeldavies_01.html Michael Davies obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717132655/http://www.ifuv.org/docs/michaeldavies_01.html |date=17 July 2010 }}, Leo Darroch, 27 April 2005, Mass of Ages, hosted on the website of [[Una Voce]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's rationale is presented in confrontational terms:
{{quote|Unless the Church is militant, She cannot thrive and flourish. Thus Christian Order is a militant antidote to the secular "live and let live" attitude which has brought the Church low. For forty years it has embodied that uncompromising spirit demanded by [[Pope Leo XIII]], who contended that in times of necessity each Catholic is "under obligation to show forth his faith to instruct and encourage other of the Faithful" (Sapientiae Christianae).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianorder.com/about.html About Us], Christian Order&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Neocatechumenal Way]] is criticized in the magazine as "heretical" ([[Lutheran]]) and a "Trojan horse" in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in the magazine, CJ O'Hehir described Ireland as "the most anti-Catholic Catholic country in the world, and the most monolithically liberal of the world's democracies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20070812032258/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/11/13/story9624.asp "All on the anti-Church bandwagon"], by Kieron Wood, [[The Sunday Business Post]], 13 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine has republished articles from ''Daylight,'' the magazine of the Catholic creationist [[Daylight Origins Society]].&lt;ref&gt;

It has been criticised by ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'' magazine for having among its contributors "extremists" (including [[John Vennari]]), a "race-baiter" ([[E.

'''Crypto-Judaism''' is the secret adherence to [[Judaism]] while publicly professing to be of another faith; practitioners are referred to as "crypto-Jews" (origin from Greek ''kryptos – κρυπτός'', 'hidden').

The term is especially applied historically to Spanish Jews who outwardly professed [[Catholicism]],&lt;ref name = "Jacobs"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hidden Heritage: The Legacy of the Crypto-Jews|last=Jacobs|first=J| year=2002| publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23517-5|oclc=48920842|page={{page needed|date=September 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Jews in New Mexico|last=Tobias|first=HJ|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-8263-1390-4|oclc=36645510|page={{page needed|date=September 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Marrano Legacy: A Contemporary Crypto-Jewish Priest Reveals Secrets of His Double Life|last=Alexy|first=T|year=2003| publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-3055-0|oclc=51059087|page={{page needed|date=September 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sephardi Jewry: A History of the Judeo-Spanish Community, 14th-20th Centuries (Jewish Communities in the Modern World) |last=Benbassa|first=Esther|authorlink1=Esther Benbassa|author2=Rodrique, A |year=2000|publisher=University of Californida Press|isbn=978-0-520-21822-2|oclc=154877054|page={{page needed|date=September 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jews of Spain: A History of the Sephardic Experience|last=Gerber|first=JS|year=1994|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-02-911574-9|oclc=30339044|page={{page needed|date=September 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[Anusim]] or [[Marrano]]s. The phenomenon is especially associated with renaissance Spain, following the 6 June, 1391, [[Antisemitism|Anti-Jewish]] [[pogrom]]s and the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews in 1492]].&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;Levine Melammed, Renee. "Women in Medieval Jewish Societies," in ''Women and Judaism: New Insights and Scholarship''.  Ed. Frederick E. Greenspahn.  New York: New York University Press, 2009.  105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
Officially, Jews who converted in Spain in the 14th and 15th centuries were known as [[New Christian|''Cristianos Nuevos'' (New Christians)]], but were commonly called ''[[converso]]s''.  Spain and Portugal passed legislation restricting their rights in the mother countries and colonies; only Christians were allowed to go to the New World.  Despite the dangers of the Inquisition, many ''conversos'' continued to secretly and discreetly practice Jewish rituals&lt;ref name="Levine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See David M. Gitlitz, ''Secrecy and Deceit: The Religion of the Crypto-Jews'' (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Portuguese ''conversos'' in Rome see James Novoa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KcFMBAAAQBAJ Being the Nação in the Eternal City: New Christian Lives in Sixteenth-Century Rome]'' (Peterborough: Baywolf Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;, such as the [[Festival of Santa Esterica]].

After the [[Alhambra decree]] of 1492 numerous ''conversos'', also called [[Xueta]] (or Chueta) in the [[Balearic Islands]] ruled by Spain, publicly professed [[Roman Catholicism]] but privately adhered to Judaism, even through the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. They are among the most widely known and documented crypto-Jews.

Crypto-Judaism existed also in earlier periods, whenever Jews were forced or pressured to convert to the majority religion by the rulers of places where they resided. Some of the Jewish followers of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] ([[Sabbateans]]) formally converted to Islam. Later followers of [[Jacob Frank]] ("Frankists") formally converted to Christianity, but maintained aspects of practice of their versions of [[Messianic Judaism]].

Crypto-Jews persisted in Russia and Eastern European countries influenced by the Soviet Union after the rise of Communism with the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] of 1917.  The government, which included secular Communist Jews, did not force Jews to convert to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], but regarded practice of any religion as undesirable. Some faiths were allowed to continue under strict supervision by the regime.  Since the end of Communism, many people in former Soviet states, including descendants of Jews, have publicly taken up the faith of their ancestors again.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The "[[Belmonte Jews]]" of Portugal, dating from the 12th century, maintained strong secret traditions for centuries. A whole community survived in secrecy by maintaining a tradition of endogamous marriage and hiding all external signs of their faith. They and their practices were discovered only in the 20th century. Their rich Sephardic tradition of Crypto-Judaism is unique. Some now profess Orthodox Judaism, although many still retain their centuries-old traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourjerusalem.com/news/story/news20031018.html |title=For Portugal's crypto-Jews, new rabbi tries to blend tradition with local custom |year=2003 |work=Our Jerusalem |last=Socolovsky |first=J |accessdate=2007-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034206/http://www.ourjerusalem.com/news/story/news20031018.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of Maimonides===
As one of the towering figures in Judaism and the publisher of the [[Mishneh Torah]] expansion of the [[Talmud]], [[Maimonides]] also issued a landmark doctrinal response to the forced conversions of Jews in the Iberian peninsula by the [[Almohads]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In his ''Epistle on Martyrdom,'' however, Maimonides suggested that the persecuted Jew should publicly adopt Islam while maintaining crypto-Judaism and not seek martyrdom unless forced to transgress Jewish commandments in public. He also excoriated one writer who advocated martyrdom for "long-winded foolish babbling and nonsense" and for misleading and hurting the Jews. In a sweeping view of the Jewish past, Maimonides marshals examples of heretics and sinners from the Bible to show that even oppressors of Israel were rewarded by God for a single act of piety or respect. How much greater then, he argues, will be the reward of the Jews "who despite the exigencies of forced conversion perform commandments secretly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Jews of Spain: A History of the Sephardic Experience

|location=New York
|publisher=The Free Press
|year=1994
|isbn=978-0029115749
|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maimonides championed rationalism over the then-accepted practice of martyrdom when facing religious adversity. This consequently legitimized crypto-Judaism by the religion's standards, and provided doctrinal backing for Jews during the centuries of the Spanish Inquisition (1478–1834).

===Before the Spanish Inquisition===
According to the [[Jewish Virtual Library]],&lt;ref name="Anusim"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01173.html|title=Anusim- Jewish Virtual Library|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; several incidents of forced conversions happened prior to 1492 and outside of Iberia. One of the earliest conversions happened a century after the [[Fall of Rome]] and was in [[Clermont-Ferrand]]. After a member of the [[Jewish]] community in [[Clermont-Ferrand]] became a [[Jewish Christian]] and was persecuted by other members of the community for doing so, the cavalcade in which he was marching persecuted his persecutors in turn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The participants in the procession then made an attack "which destroyed [the synagogue] completely, razing it to the grounds." Subsequently, Bishop *Avitus directed a letter to the Jews in which he disclaimed the use of compulsion to make them adopt Christianity, but announced at the end of the missive: "Therefore if ye be ready to believe as I do, be one flock with us, and I shall be your pastor; but if ye be not ready, depart from this place." The community hesitated for three days before making a decision. Finally the majority, some 500, accepted Christianity. The Christians in Clermont greeted the event with rejoicing: "Candles were lit, the lamps shone, the whole city radiated with the light of the snow-white flock" (i.e., the forced converts). The Jews who preferred exile left for *Marseilles (Gregory of Tours, Histories, 5:11). The poet Venantius Fortunatus composed a poem to commemorate the occasion. In 582 the Frankish king Chilperic compelled numerous Jews to adopt Christianity. Again the anusim were not wholehearted in their conversion, for "some of them, cleansed in body but not in heart, denied God, and returned to their ancient perfidy, so that they were seen keeping the Sabbath, as well as Sunday" (ibid., 6:17).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Clermont-Ferrand]] conversions preceded the first forced conversions in Iberia by 40 years. Forced baptisms of Jews took place in Iberia in 616 at the insistence of Visigoth monarch [[Sisibut]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Persistent attempts to enforce conversion were made in the seventh century by the Visigoths in Spain after they had adopted the Roman Catholic faith. Comparatively mild legal measures were followed by the harsh edict issued by King Sisibut in 616, ordering the compulsory baptism of all Jews. After conversion, however, the anusim evidently maintained their Jewish cohesion and religious life. It was undoubtedly this problem that continued to occupy Spanish sovereigns at the successive Councils of Toledo representing both the ecclesiastical and secular authorities...Thus, steps were taken to secure that the children of converts had a Christian religious education as well as to prevent the older generation from continuing to observe the Jewish rites or from failing to observe the Catholic ones. A system of strict supervision by the clergy over the way of life and movements of the anusim was imposed...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Neofiti===
The [[Neofiti]] were a group of crypto-Jews living in the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which included all of Southern Italy from the 13th to the 16th centuries.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Mediterranean and Asia==
There have been several communities of Crypto-Jews in Muslim lands.  The ancestors of the [[Daggatun]]s in Morocco are thought to have kept up their Jewish practices a long time after their nominal adoption of Islam.  In Iran, a large community of Crypto-Jews lived in [[Mashhad]], near [[greater Khorasan|Khorassan]], where they were known as ''"Jedid al-Islam"''; they were mass-converted to Islam around 1839 after the [[Allahdad]] events. Most of this community left for Israel in 1946. Some converted to Islam and remained in Iran.&lt;ref name="JedidAlIslam"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.fis-iran.org/en/irannameh/volxix/mashhad-jewish-community |journal=Iran Nameh |volume=XIX |title=The 'Jadid Al-Islams' of Mashhad |first=Jaleh |last=Pirnazar |location=Bethesda, MD, USA |publisher=[[Foundation for Iranian Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nissimi"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.sussex-academic.co.uk/sa/titles/jewish_studies/nissimi.htm |title=The Crypto-Jewish Mashhadis |author=Hilda Nissimi |isbn=978-1-84519-160-3 |date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one central [[Iran]]ian village, local Muslims practice many Jewish customs, such as women lighting a candle on Friday night (the eve of the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]). Before sundown on Friday, they prepare a small fire which they leave on throughout Saturday, so as not to ignite the fire on the Sabbath.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===India===

In 1494, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], authorized by [[Pope Alexander VI]], Portugal was given the right to found colonies in the Eastern Hemisphere. In the East, according to Walter Fischel, the Portuguese found use for the crypto-Jews in [[Portuguese India|Goa]] and their other Indian and Asian possessions. Jews were used as "letter-carriers, translators, agents, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Leading Jews in the Service of Portuguese India|jstor = 1453185|journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review|date = 1956-01-01|pages = 37–57|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/1453185|first = Walter J.|last = Fischel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of the Sephardic Jews and anusim to speak [[Arabic]] made them vital to Portuguese colonial ambitions in the East, where they could go on diplomatic and trade missions in the courts of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empire and elsewhere. India also attracted Sephardic Jews and anusim for other reasons. In his lecture at the [[Library of Congress]], [[Sanjay Subrahmanyam]] said that crypto-Jews were especially attracted to India because not only was it a center of trade in goods such as [[spice]]s and [[diamond]]s, but India also had established and ancient Jewish settlements along its Western coast. Although Jews were able to openly worship in Southern and Eastern India with the Bene Israel, Malibar, Cochin, and Baghdadi Jewish communities, they experienced severe violence and persecution from the Muslim influence in Northwest Punjabi India. The presence of these older communities offered the anusim, who had been forced to accept Catholicism, the chance to live within the Portuguese Empire, away from the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]], and, if they wished, they were able to contact the Jews in these communities and re-adopt the faith of their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Jews &amp; New Christians in Portuguese Asia 1500–1700|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80cdauHCKHk|date = 2013-12-06|accessdate = 2016-02-22|last = LibraryOfCongress}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of crypto-Jews in India aroused the anger of the Archbishop of Goa, Dom [[Gaspar Jorge de Leão Pereira]] and others who wrote polemics and letters to [[Lisbon]] urging that the Inquisition be brought to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Contra Iudaeos: Ancient and Medieval Polemics Between Christians and Jews|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-yF4wPWF5EC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=Contra+Iudaeos:+Ancient+and+Medieval+Polemics+Between+Christians+and+Jews+india&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PvL6Ru94xe&amp;sig=g6y3qVKeTPNXiRfYZ2tqrI_JbXw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ1o7Mz4rLAhXCqx4KHXoCBA8Q6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Contra%2520Iudaeos%253A%2520Ancient%2520and%2520Medieval%2520Polemics%2520Between%2520Christians%2520and%2520Jews%2520india&amp;f=false|publisher = Mohr Siebeck|date = 1996-01-01|isbn = 9783161464829|language = en|first = Ora|last = Limor|first2 = Guy G.|last2 = Stroumsa|page = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four years after [[Portuguese Inquisition]] began, the [[Goa Inquisition|Goan Inquisition]] came to India in 1560 after [[Francis Xavier]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;– who was made a saint by the Catholic Church – placed a request for it to the King of Portugal. The Inquisition in all the Portuguese territories put roughly 45,000 people on trial with "the most active court being in Goa".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inquisition Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Inquisition|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Inquisition.aspx|website = www.encyclopedia.com|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Goan Inquisition initially targeted anusim and Jews, but like the Inquisitions in Europe, it also targeted [[Crypto-Islam|crypto-Muslims]], and later [[Hindu]]s. The Catholic Church destroyed a significant number of the Inquisitorial records, the number of victims in the Goan Inquisition is estimated to be roughly one-third of the total figure, based on the records which remain. The presence of crypto-Judaism in India continues to be an ongoing field of academic research.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Spanish America ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
Crypto-Judaism was documented chiefly in Spanish-held colonial territories in northern [[New Spain|Mexico]]. Numerous conversos joined Spanish and Portuguese expeditions, believing there was economic opportunity in the new lands, and that they would have more freedom at a distance far from Iberia. Different situations developed in the early colonial period of Mexico, the frontier province of [[Nuevo León]], the later northern frontier provinces, and the colonial experience of the [[Mexican Inquisition]] The crypto-Jewish traditions have complex histories and are typically embedded in an amalgam of syncretic Roman Catholic and Judaic traditions. In many ways resurgent Judaic practices mirrored indigenous peoples' maintaining their traditions practiced loosely under a Roman Catholic veil. In addition, Catholicism was syncretic, absorbing other traditions and creating a new creole religion.

The traditional [[Festival of Santa Esterica]] was preserved among the Conversos who migrated to the New World and is still practiced today among their descendants.

===Early colonial period—16th century===
Some of the Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain went to Portugal, but in 1497 that country effectively converted all remaining Jewish children, making them wards of the state unless the parents also converted.  Therefore, many of the early crypto-Jewish migrants to Mexico in the early colonial days were technically first to second-generation Portuguese with Spanish roots before that. The number of such Portuguese migrants was significant enough that Spanish colonists began to use "Portuguese" as a synonym for "Jewish" for their settlers. [[Immigration to Mexico]] offered lucrative trade possibilities in a well-populated colony with nascent Spanish culture. Some migrants believed that this region would be more tolerant since the lands were overwhelmingly populated by non-Christian indigenous peoples and it was far removed from the metropole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejournal.unam.mx/ehn/ehn32/EHNO3201.pdf Presencia portuguesa en el México Colonial] León Portilla, Miguel. UNAM; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial officials believed that many crypto-Jews were going to Mexico during the 16th century and complained in written documents to Spain that Spanish society in Mexico would become significantly Jewish. Officials found and condemned clandestine synagogues in Mexico City. At this point, colonial administrators instituted [[cleanliness of blood|the Law of the Pure Blood]], which prohibited migration to Mexico for [[New Christian]]s (Cristiano Nuevo), i.e. anyone who could not prove to be Old Christians for at least the last three generations. In addition, the administration initiated the [[Mexican Inquisition]] to ensure the Catholic orthodoxy of all migrants to Mexico.  The Mexico Inquisition was also deployed in the traditional manner to ensure orthodoxy of converted indigenous peoples.  The first victims of burnings (or [[Auto de Fe|''autos de fé'']]) of the Mexican Inquisition were indigenous converts convicted of heresy or crypto-Jews convicted of relapsing into their ancestral faith.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Except for those allowed to settle the province of [[Nuevo Leon]] under an exemption from the Blood Purity Laws, the number of conversos migrating to the New World was reduced.

===Nuevo León (1590s to early 17th century)===
The colonization of New Spain took place as a northward expansion over increasingly harsh geography, in regions that were occupied by tribes angered at the encroachment; they formed loose confederations of indigenous peoples to resist the settlers. Spain financed the expansion by exploiting mineral wealth, enslaving or forcing indigenous peoples to labor in mines. It established [[encomiendas]] for raising livestock, thereby displacing the local people. The indigenous peoples of the North-Eastern quadrant of [[New Spain]] (Nueva España) proved particularly resistant to colonial pressures. The [[Chichimec]], [[Apache]], and other tribes resisted conversion to Christianity, and avoided being impressed as laborers or slaves on Spanish ranches and in mines. The Spanish believed such peoples made the frontier (''frontera'') a lawless region.

[[Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva]], a royal accountant, was a Portuguese [[New Christian]]. He received a royal charter from the Spanish Crown to settle [[Nuevo León]], a large expanse of land in the hostile frontier. Because of the dangers and difficulties of this region, Carvajal y de la Cueva received an exemption in his charter from the usual requirement that he prove that all new settlers were "Old Christians" ([[Limpieza de sangre|of at least three generations]]) rather than recently converted Jews or Muslims.  This exemption allowed people to go to Nuevo León who were legally barred from entering [[New Spain]] elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=La colonización del Nuevo Reino de León. Y la fundación de Monterrey, por el ilustre gobernador: Don Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva. |date=June 2007 |url=http://www.rcadena.net/carvajal/carvajal.htm |accessdate=March 4, 2011 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carvajal was authorized to bring 100 soldiers and 60 laborers to New Spain; many have been documented as Crypto-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=138&amp;letter=C "Carabajal"], ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', Accessed Mar 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MusMetHistoricalRoom16.JPG|thumb|250px|Jewish religious items at the Metropolitan Museum of [[Monterrey]].]]

With Carvajal as governor, [[Monterrey]] was established as the center (now in the state of Nuevo León).  Within a few years, some people reported to authorities in Mexico City that Jewish rites were being performed in the Northern Province and efforts to convert heathen indigenous peoples were lax.&lt;ref name="flint"/&gt; The principal economic activity of Carvajal and his associates seems to have been capturing [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Indians]] and selling them into slavery.&lt;ref name="flint"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Flint |first1=Richard |last2=Cushing |first2=Shirley |title=Juan Morlete, Gaspar Castano de Sosa, and the Province of Nuevo Leon |publisher=New Mexico Office of the State Historian |url=http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=476 |accessdate=March 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727121709/http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=476 |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carvajal's Lieutenant Governor, [[Gaspar Castaño de Sosa]], led a large expedition to [[New Mexico]] in 1591 in an effort to establish a colony.  Castaño was arrested for this unauthorized expedition and sentenced to exile in the [[Philippines]]. The sentence was later reversed, but he had already been killed in the [[Molucca Islands]] when the Chinese slaves on his ship mutinied.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, George P. and Rey, Apapito, ''The Rediscovery of New Mexico, 1580–1594'', Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1966, pp. 48, 245–301&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Carvajal, his immediate family members, and others of his entourage were called to appear before the Inquisition in Mexico City.  They were arrested and jailed. The governor subsequently died in jail, prior to a sentence of exile. His niece Anna Carvajal had been tortured and implicated all the family in so-called charges. They were all executed by [[burning at the stake]] for relapsing into Judaism, except for one nephew who escaped arrest.

The governor's nephews changed their surname to [[Lumbroso]]. One of these was Joseph Lumbroso, also known as [[Luis de Carabajal the younger|Luis de Carvajal el Mozo]], who is said to have circumcised himself in the desert to conform to Jewish law. He committed suicide to avoid being burned at the stake. His memoirs, letters and inquisition record were preserved and are held in the archive. Two other nephews also changed their names to Lumbroso and migrated to Italy, where they became noted rabbis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

When Carvajal was in office, the city of Monterrey became a destination for other crypto-Jews who wanted to escape the Mexican Inquisition in the south of the territory.  Thus, Nuevo León and the founding of Monterrey are significant as they attracted crypto-Jewish migrants from all parts of [[New Spain]].  They created one of the earliest Jewish-related communities in Mexico.  (The Jewish communities in modern Mexico, which practice their Judaism openly, were not established until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after considerable immigration of Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe, and [[Mizrahi Jews]] from Turkey and Syria.)

===Former New Spain territories in United States, 17th–18th centuries===
Due to the Inquisition activities in Nuevo León, many crypto-Jewish descendants migrated to frontier colonies further west, using the trade routes passing through the towns of Sierra Madre Occidental and Chihuahua, Hermosillo and Cananea, and to the north on the trade route to [[El Paso, Texas|Paso del Norte]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] (both cities in the colonial [[Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico]]). Some even traveled to [[Alta California]] on the Pacific Coast.

In the late 20th century, in modern-day [[Southwestern United States]] specifically [[New Mexico]], which was a former territory of New Spain, several [[Hispanos of New Mexico]] have stated a belief that they are descended from crypto-Jews of the colonial period. While most maintain their Roman Catholic and Christian faiths, they often cite as evidence memories of older relatives practicing Jewish traditions. Since the 1990s, the crypto-Jews of New Mexico have been extensively studied and documented by several research scholars, including Stanley M. Hordes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To The End of The Earth: A History of the Crypto-Jews of [[New Mexico]]|year=2005|last=Hordes|first=Stanley M.|isbn= 978-0-231-12937-4|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Liebman Jacobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hidden Heritage: The Legacy of the Crypto Jews|year=2002|last=Liebman Jacobs|first=Janet|isbn= 978-0-520-23517-5|publisher=University of California|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulamith Halevy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Descendants of the Anusim (Crypto-Jews) in Contemporary Mexico|year=2009|last=Halevy|first=Schulamith C.|publisher=Hebrew University|url=http://anusim.org/AnusimMexico.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Seth D. Kunin, who calls them ''Hispanos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Juggling Identities: Identity and Authenticity Among the Crypto-Jews|year=2009|last=Kunin|first=Seth D.|isbn= 978-0-231-14218-2|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kunin noted that most of this group in New Mexico has not formally embraced Judaism nor joined the organized Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Kunin (2009), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Though some have been sceptical, such as Folklorist Judith Neulander arguing that people could be referring to traditions of modern [[Ashkenazi]] Jews migrants and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestant]] [[Christian]]s who purposely acquired and employed Jewish traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2000/12/ferry.htm |title=Mistaken Identity?

The highly influential Hordes has been charged with "single-minded speculation based on largely ephemeral or highly ambiguous evidence" for his conclusion that modern-day Hispanos who claim crypto-Jewish roots are heirs to an unbroken chain of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ben-Ur|first1=Aviva|title=[review] To the End of the Earth: A History of the Crypto-Jews of New Mexico|journal=American Jewish History|date=2007|volume= 93,|issue= 2|page=266|url=http://people.umass.edu/abenur/article%20pdfs/Ben-Ur%20on%20Hordes%20AJH%2093.2.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kunin responded to some of this criticism in his book ''Juggling Identities: Identity and Authenticity Among the Crypto-Jews''.

===Peru===
In [[Peru]], conversos arrived at the time of the Spanish Conquest. At first, they had lived without restrictions because the Inquisition was not active there at the beginning of the Viceroyalty. With the advent of the Inquisition, New Christians began to be persecuted, and in some cases executed. The descendants of these colonial Sephardic Jewish descent converts to Christianity settled mainly [[North macroregion, Peru|in the north]] of the Andes and of the high jungle of Peru, where they married local women and became assimilated.

===Colombia===
In the department of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Colombia]], as well as in the greater [[Paisa region]], some families also hold traditions and oral accounts of Jewish descent. In this population, Y-DNA genetic analysis has shown an origin of male founders predominantly from "southern Spain but also suggest that a fraction came from northern Iberia and that some possibly had a Sephardic origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Strong Amerind/White Sex Bias and a Possible Sephardic Contribution among the Founders of a Population in Northwest Colombia|last=Carvajal-Carmona|first=LG |author2=Soto ID |author3=Pineda N |author4=Ortiz-Barrientos D |author5=Duque C |author6=Ospina-Duque J |author7=McCarthy M |author8=Montoya P |author9=Alvarez VM |author10=Bedoya G |author11=Ruiz-Linares A|year=2000|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=67|issue=5|pages=1062–1066|pmid=11032790|doi=10.1016/S0002-9297(07)62956-5|pmc=1288568}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medellín]] has a tradition of the ''marranada'', where a [[pig]] is slaughtered, butchered and consumed on the streets of every neighborhood each [[Christmas]]. This custom has been interpreted as an annual affirmation of the rejection of Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pasaportecolombiano.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/medellin-resplandece-en-diciembre-la-luciernaga-de-colombia/|year=2007|title=Medellín resplandece en diciembre|last=Rodas|first=Albeiro|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolivia===
A safe haven destination for [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] [[Conversos]] during the Spanish colonial was [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Farewell España, The World The Sephardim Remembered", written by Howard Sachar&lt;/ref&gt; In 1557 many Crypto-Jews joined [[Ñuflo de Chávez]] and were among the pioneers who founded the city.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"History of the Jewish People", written by Eli Birnbaum&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century some Crypto-Jews that faced persecution from the Inquisition and local authorities in nearby [[Potosí]], [[La Paz]] and [[Sucre|La Plata]] moved to Santa Cruz, as it was the most isolated urban settlement and because the Inquisition did not bother the [[Conversos]] there;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Storm Clouds over the Bolivian Refuge", written by Sherry Mangan&lt;/ref&gt; as a frontier town it was meant to be a buffer to the Portuguese and [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] raids that threatened the mines of Peru. Some settled in the city of Santa Cruz and its adjacent towns, including [[Vallegrande]], Postrervalle, [[Portachuelo]], Terevinto, [[Pucarà, Bolivia]], and [[Cotoca]].&lt;ref&gt;"Los Judíos de Vallegrande", El Deber, written by Mario Rueda Peña, November 23, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the oldest Catholic families in Santa Cruz are of Jewish ancestry on the paternal side; some practice certain traditions of Judaism. As recently as the 1920s, several families preserved seven-branched candlesticks and served dishes cooked with [[kosher]] practices.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It is still customary among certain old families to light candles on Friday at sunset and to mourn the deaths of close relatives by sitting on the floor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; After almost five centuries, some of the descendants of these families acknowledge Jewish ancestry, but practice Catholicism.

===Costa Rica===
Some Crypto-Jews established themselves in the outskirts of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], [[Costa Rica]] in the 16th century. They passed as Catholics in public and practiced their Jewish rituals in privacy. In the town of Itzkazú (modern day Escazú), some Crypto-Jewish families did not maintain secrecy. Locals started to associate their rituals and unintelligible prayers in Hebrew with witchcraft. Since then, Escazú has been known in Costa Rican folklore as the "city of the witches".

===Elsewhere in Latin America===

In addition to these communities, Roman Catholic-professing communities descended from male Crypto-Jews are said to exist in [[the Dominican Republic]], [[Cuba]], [[Jamaica]], Puerto Rico&lt;ref name="clara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/037/6.html|year=1999|title=The Inquisition in the New World|last=Steinberg-Spitz|first=Clara|accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in various other countries of [[South America]], such as [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]]. From these communities comes the proverb, "Catholic by faith, Jewish by blood".

==Notable Crypto-Jews==
*[[Antonio Fernandez Carvajal]] was a Portuguese merchant in London; "like other Marranos in London, Carvajal prayed at the Catholic chapel of the Spanish ambassador, while simultaneously playing a leading role in the secret Jewish community, which met at the clandestine synagogue at Creechurch Lane."&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004 |editor-last=Matthew |editor-first=HCG |editor2=Harrison, B |isbn=978-0-19-861411-1|oclc=166700558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Isaac Cardoso]] was a Jewish physician, philosopher, and polemic writer, who was born in Portugal but ultimately settled in Italy. For a time he went by the name Fernando to evade the Inquisition. After finding safe haven in Verona he openly embraced Judaism becoming a leading scholar in Italy. 

===Speculative Crypto-Jews===
Because of the hidden nature of their lives, the identities of some historical Crypto-Jews can only be guessed at by scholars. There are some notable examples of persons who are speculated by some scholars of having been Crypto-Jews, though there is as yet no consensus.

* [[Christopher Columbus]] has been historically described as a Genoese sailor who moved to Spain. However, evidence of his connection to Italy is at best flimsy and in fact details of his earlier life appear to be very obscure, pointing to the possibility of someone who changed his identity and hid his past. By contrast, there is actually strong evidence of Columbus' strong  relationships with the Jewish community. Indeed his first letters from the New World were written to his Jewish financiers. These and other clues in his writings have led to the speculation among some scholars that Columbus was a Jew that changed his identity to hide from the Inquisition and/or to secure the support of the Spanish monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/05/20/opinion/garcia-columbus-jewish/index.html | title=Was Columbus secretly a Jew? | date= May 24, 2012 | newspaper=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent years researching and championing the music and life of [[sunshine pop]] progenitor [[Curt Boettcher]] and wrote liner notes for several collections of his work.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

==Religious conversion and subsequent achievements==
In 1999, Goldstein had a [[Born again|"born-again"]] experience that led her to become a [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimiadi, Melissa (November 28, 2012). [http://www.nycreligion.info/dawn-edens-lives-saints-victims-sexual-abuse/ "Dawn Eden’s Lives of the Saints for victims of sexual abuse"]. ''A Journey Through NYC Religions''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, she was received into the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Eden, Dawn (February 27, 2009).

[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]].&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked as a copy editor at the ''[[New York Post]]'' from early 2002 to January 2005. A headline she wrote about a toilet-bowl collapse ("Hurt in line of doody") won first place in the "Brightest Headline" category of the 2004 New York State Associated Press Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/015147/department-of-corrections-howdy-doody "Department of Corrections: Howdy, Doody"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424061504/http://gawker.com/015147/department-of-corrections-howdy-doody |date=April 24, 2010 }}.

Retrieved 2009-10-05&lt;/ref&gt; She was forced to leave the ''Post'' after edits she made to a story about in vitro fertilization revealed her pro-life sympathies. The firing led the ''[[New York Observer]]'' to publish a front-page profile of her by George Gurley, "Eden in Exile."&lt;ref&gt;Gurley, George. {{citation |url=http://nyobserver.com/pages/frontpage6.asp |title="Eden in Exile" |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212032312/http://nyobserver.com/pages/frontpage6.asp |archivedate=2005-02-12 |date=2005-02-14 }}, ''[[New York Observer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein was hired in April 2005 by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' as assistant news editor of its newly relaunched National Edition.&lt;ref name=GetReligion&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getreligion.org/getreligion/2014/8/1/the-inky-fingered-dawn |title=The Inky-Fingered Dawn |last1=Eden |first1=Dawn |date=1 August 2014 |website=GetReligion.org |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later became deputy news editor for the newspaper's new weekly regional editions.&lt;ref name=GetReligion/&gt;

Her first book ''The Thrill of the Chaste'' was published in December 2006; she promoted it with appearances on the [[Eternal Word Television Network]] and NBC's [[Today (NBC program)|''Today Show'']].&lt;ref&gt;Eden, Dawn (March 2, 2008).

[[MSNBC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein left the ''Daily News'' in 2007 to move to Washington, D.C., where, in 2008, she was successfully treated for [[thyroid cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Eden, Dawn (August 25, 2008).

In May 2010, she received an M.A. in theology from [[Dominican House of Studies]] after defending her master's thesis, a critique of [[Christopher West]]'s presentation of [[Pope John Paul II]]'s [[theology of the body]]. Three months later, after [[Alice von Hildebrand]] cited Goldstein's research in her own critique of West,&lt;ref&gt;von Hildebrand, Alice.

Goldstein's second book, ''My Peace I Give You: Healing Sexual Wounds with the Help of the Saints,'' was published in April 2012 by Ave Maria Press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avemariapress.com/product/1-59471-290-5/My-Peace-I-Give-You/ ''My Peace I Give You'']. Ave Maria Press.

After receiving her [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|sacred theology licentiate]] from the Dominican House of Studies in 2014, Goldstein briefly contributed to the religion-newswriting critique blog ''GetReligion'' and began working toward a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|Doctor of Sacred Theology degree]] at the [[University of St. Mary of the Lake]].&lt;ref name=GetReligion/&gt; ''The Thrill of the Chaste (Catholic Edition),'' a revised version of her 2006 work, was issued in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avemariapress.com/product/1-59471-558-0/The-Thrill-of-the-Chaste-Catholic-Edition/ ''The Thrill of the Chaste (Catholic Edition)'']. Ave Maria Press. Retrieved January 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her fourth book, ''Remembering God's Mercy: Redeem the Past and Free Yourself from Painful Memories'', was published by [[Ave Maria Press]] in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avemariapress.com/product/1-59471-636-6/Remembering-Gods-Mercy/ ''Remembering God's Mercy'' at Ave Maria Press]&lt;/ref&gt; She discussed the book in an interview with [[Kathryn Jean Lopez]] at ''[[National Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431193/remembering-gods-mercy-dawn-eden-interview Lopez, Kathryn Jean, "How Mercy Frees Us from Bad Memories," ''National Review'', February 12, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The book won First Place in the Inspirational category of the Association of Catholic Publishers 2017 Excellence in Publishing Awards. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicpublishers.org/news/346599/Models-of-Grace-Mercy-Faith-Primary-Focus-of-2017-Excellence-in-Publishing-Awards-Winners.htm Brown, Therese, "Models of Grace, Mercy, Faith Primary Focus of 2017 'Excellence in Publishing Awards' Winners,"] May 23, 2017, News &amp; Press: ACP News&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Goldstein became the first woman in the University of St. Mary of the Lake's history to receive a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree.&lt;ref name=Pashman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eden, Dawn (May 7, 2016).

{{Nihongo|'''''Ema'''''|絵馬||lit. "picture-horse"}} are small [[wood]]en plaques, common to Japan, in which [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]] worshippers write prayers or wishes. The ''ema'' are left hanging up at the [[Shinto shrine|shrine]], where the ''[[kami]]'' (spirits or gods) are believed to receive them.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reader|first1=Ian|title=Letters to the Gods: The Form and Meaning of Ema|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=24–50|doi=10.2307/30233428|jstor=30233428}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} Typically 15&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 9&amp;nbsp;cm high, they often carry images or are shaped like animals, or symbols from the [[zodiac]], Shinto, or the particular shrine or temple.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|26}}  In ancient times people would donate [[horse]]s to the shrines for good favor; over time this was transferred to a wooden plaque with a picture of a horse, and later still to the various wooden plaques sold today for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="Holtom"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holtom|first1=D. C.|title=Japanese Votive Pictures (The Ikoma Ema)|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|date=1938|volume=1|issue=1|pages=154–164|doi=10.2307/2382449|jstor=2382449}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}} Once inscribed with a wish, ''Ema'' are hung at the shrine&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=Jennifer|title=Ema-gined Community: Votive Tablets (ema) and Strategic Ambivalence in Wartime Japan|journal=Asian Ethnology|date=2008|volume=67|issue=1|pages=43–77|doi=10.2307/25135286|jstor=25135286}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}} until they are ritually burned at special events, symbolic of the liberation of the wish from the writer.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

== History ==
In some early Shinto and folk traditions of Japan, horses were seen to carry messages from the ''kami'', and usually used to transmit requests during droughts or famines.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|27}} Horses were extremely expensive, and figures made of clay or wood have been found dating to the [[Nara period]].&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|27}} The earliest text record of a substitution is from the ''[[Honcho Bunsui|Honcho bunsui]]'' from 1013, in which an offering of three paper horses is made at the Kitano Tenjin shrine.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|27}} During the [[Kamakura period]], the practice entered into Buddhist practice, as evidenced in painted scrolls of ''ema'' at Buddhist temples.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

The depictions of objects aside from horses can be traced to either the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] or [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] periods, beginning with larger sized ema (named ''ōema'') but also representing new forms, such as ships. Artists of this period, such as [[Hokusai]], began to create ''ema'' in distinct styles, and creating the objects became a professionalized craft.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

Today, they are mostly produced at or by the shrine or temple in which they are found.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|31}} Some shrines have faced criticism for profiting from the sale of ''ema''. In 1979, two shrines dedicated to education sold ''ema'' for examination success, transforming the funds into a scholarship in 1980 after public outcry.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;{{rp|50}}

== Symbols ==
[[File:Dazaifu Tenmangu 08.jpg|alt=Dazaifu Tenmangu shrine|thumb|''Ema'' on display at [[Dazaifu Tenman-gū|Dazaifu Tenmangu]] shrine in Fukuoka Prefecture. ]]
Historically, groups of farmers or small merchants could organize to hire a local artisan to create an ''ema'' to be donated to a shrine for a specific purpose, such as a good harvest.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Richard W.|title=Jingū Kōgō "Ema" in Southwestern Japan: Reflections and Anticipations of the "Seikanron" Debate in the Late Tokugawa and Early Meiji Period|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|date=2002|volume=61|issue=2|pages=247–270|doi=10.2307/1178973|jstor=1178973}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|257}} Archeological records suggest this could have been used to send political signals, as in the case of A [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] shrine that saw an increase in commissioned portraits depicting peaceful relations with Korea amidst tensions between the nations during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;{{rp|260}}

''Ema'' can represent deities, such as [[Guanyin|Kannon]] and Jizu, but also more specific iconography depending on their intended purpose. These include depictions of a phallus or breasts for fertility prayers, or an octopus representing the desire to be cured of warts.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|31}} Another example are sandals depicted on plaques for foot remedies.&lt;ref name="Holtom" /&gt;{{rp|158}} Another form of ema wish for "tie-cutting."&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;{{rp|56}} Whereas a man and woman standing beside a palm tree is interpreted as a wish for a long relationship, another plaque depicts nettles between the couple, wishing for divorce.&lt;ref name="Holtom" /&gt;{{rp|158}} Common symbolism also includes nettles placed beside an object one wishes to sever ties with. During wartime, ema depicting the same man, one in military uniform and one in civilian clothing, suggested a desire for a soldier to sever from his civilian life.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;{{rp|56}} For some, the same image may have been used to express a wish to avoid military service altogether.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

The use of text has gradually replaced the overt use of symbolism in contemporary ''ema''.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|33}} The rise of literacy has encouraged guests to write their own messages, which has dramatically decreased the use of distinct ''ema'' as a way to transmit a specific wish.&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt;{{rp|34}}

==Function==
As a ritual, the ''ema'' is a means to communicate wishes to both priests and the kami. The public nature of the ema, which are displayed at shrines before their ritual burning, also serves a social function for communicating to the community that an individual has made the wish. Burning the wishes helps to "symbolically liberate" the spirit of the wish into the world. In some cases, however, wishes are taken from the shrine to be hung at home, though still ritually burned in special ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;{{rp|53}}

The term '''Fair Game''' is used to describe policies and practices carried out by the [[Church of Scientology]] towards people and groups it perceives as its enemies. Founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|year=2008|title=Secrecy and New Religious Movements: Concealment, Surveillance, and Privacy in a New Age of Information|journal=Religion Compass|publisher=Wiley |volume=2|issue=1|pages=66–83|issn=1749-8171|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8171.2007.00052.x|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals or groups who are "Fair Game" are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="streeter_fairgame"&gt;{{Harvnb|Streeter|2008|pp=217–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Hubbard officially canceled use of the term "Fair Game" because of negative public relations it caused, although the Church's aggressive response to criticism continued.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;

Applying the principles of Fair Game, Hubbard and his followers targeted many individuals as well as government officials and agencies, including a [[Operation Snow White|program of covert and illegal infiltration]] of the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and other [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008" /&gt; They also conducted private investigations, [[character assassination]] and [[lawsuit|legal action]] against the Church's critics in the media.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt; The policy remains in effect and has been defended by the Church of Scientology as a core religious practice.&lt;ref name="wollersheim212calapp3d872" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flinnp4032" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wollersheimb023193" /&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, for their major branch in Los Angeles, California, the Scientology organization largely switched from using church members in harassment campaigns to hiring private investigators, including former and current Los Angeles police officers.  The reason seemed to be that this gave the church a layer of protection in case embarrassing tactics were used and made public.&lt;ref name="On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes, Los Angeles Times, June 29, 1990"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientology062990x-story.html#page=1 On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes], ''Los Angeles Times'', Joel Sappell, Robert W. Welkes, page A1, June 29, 1990.  "Church spokesmen maintain that Hubbard rescinded the policy three years after it was written  .  .  .  .  .  But various judges and juries have concluded that while the actual labelling of persons as 'fair game' was abandoned, the harassment continued unabated."

==Background==
[[Scientology]]'s founder, L. Ron Hubbard, said all opposition came from what he called "[[Suppressive Person]]s" (SPs)— which scientologists claim are "anti-social people who want to destroy anything that benefits humanity."&lt;ref name="streeter_fairgame" /&gt; In written policies dating from the mid-1950s, Hubbard told his followers to take a hard line against perceived opponents. In 1955 he wrote, "The purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to win. The law can be used easily to harass, and enough harassment on somebody who is simply on the thin edge anyway, well knowing that he is not authorized, will generally be sufficient to cause his professional decease. If possible, of course, ruin him utterly".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. R. (1955). ''The Scientologist - A Manual on the Dissemination of Material'', reprinted in {{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L.

In his confidential ''Manual of Justice'' of 1959, Hubbard wrote "People attack Scientology. I never forget it, always even the score."&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt; He advocated using [[private investigator]]s to investigate critics, who had turned out to be "members of the [[Communist]] Party or criminals, usually both. The smell of police or private detectives caused them to fly, to close down, to confess. Hire them and damn the cost when you need to."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atack|1990|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that in dealing with opponents, his followers should "always find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace. Don't ever defend. Always attack."&lt;ref name="stout"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Stephen A.|title=Encyclopedia of religion, communication, and media|editor=Daniel A.

The Church has retained an aggressive policy towards those it perceives as its enemies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Melton|first=J. Gordon|title=The Church of Scientology|publisher=[[Signature Books]] in cooperation with [[CESNUR]]|year=2000|series=Studies in contemporary religions|page=36|isbn=1-56085-139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ultra&gt;{{cite web | first = Douglas | last = Frantz | title = An Ultra-Aggressive Use of Investigators and the Courts | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3D71639F93AA35750C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work = [[The New York Times]]| date = March 9, 1997 | accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued as late as 1985 that retributive action against "enemies of Scientology" should be considered a [[Constitution (United States)|Constitution]]ally-protected "core practice" of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lermanet2.com/reference/wollersheim.htm (courtesy link) Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology of California, Court of Appeal of the State of California, civ.no.B023193, 18 July 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy==
In 1965 Hubbard formulated the "'''Fair Game Law'''", which states how to deal with people who interfere with Scientology's activities. These [[Suppressive Person|suppressive persons]] could be considered "fair game" for retaliation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By FAIR GAME is meant, may not be further protected by the codes and disciplines or the rights of a Scientologist.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter 1 Mar 65 "Suppressive Acts - Suppression of Scientology and Scientologists - The Fair Game Law" 1965-03-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In other words, a person who attacked the Church would not be protected by the Church or granted the rights of Scientologists in good standing.

In December of that year, Hubbard reissued the policy with additional clarifications to define the scope of Fair Game. He made it clear that the policy applied to non-Scientologists as well, declaring:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The homes, property, places and abodes of persons who have been active in attempting to: suppress Scientology or Scientologists are all beyond any protection of Scientology Ethics, unless absolved by later Ethics or an amnesty ... this Policy Letter extends to suppressive non-Scientology wives and husbands and parents, or other family members or hostile groups or even close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.planetkc.com/sloth/sci/sp_rules.html HCOPL 23 December 1965, "Suppressive Acts - Suppression of Scientology and Scientologists - The Fair Game Law"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614180458/http://www.planetkc.com/sloth/sci/sp_rules.html |date=14 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''Introduction to Scientology Ethics'', published in 1968, Hubbard wrote that no Scientologist could be punished "for any action taken against a Suppressive Person or Group during the period that person or group is 'fair game'."&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;
He made it clear elsewhere in his writings that the policy would be applied to external organizations, including governments, that interfered with Scientology's activities. He told Scientologists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (in refusing the FCDC [''Founding Church of Scientology, Washington DC''] non-profit status) continues to act up or if the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] does sue we can of course Comm Ev [''Committee of Evidence''] them and if found guilty, label and publish them as a Suppressive Group and fair game ... [N]one is fair game until he or she declares against us.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, HCOPL April 2, 1965, "Administration outside Scientology"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1967 policy titled ''Penalties for Lower Conditions'', Hubbard wrote that opponents who are "fair game" may be "deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed."&lt;ref name="urban2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|date=June 2006|title=Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=74|issue=2|pages=356–389|issn=1477-4585|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj084|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allard1974"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sect ordered to pay $300,000 to victim|date=June 1, 1974|work=Los Angeles Times|pages=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wallis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HCOPL 18 October 67 Issue IV, ''Penalties for Lower Conditions''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sandberg |first1=Russell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJe1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT163&amp;dq=scientology+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjexaC03ObMAhWBbCYKHQDGBoc4ChDoAQg6MAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=scientology&amp;f=false |title=Religion and Legal Pluralism Ashgate AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Series |isbn=9781317068013 |accessdate=2016-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a policy letter dated July 21, 1968, Hubbard explicitly cancelled these penalties. The new list of ''Penalties for Lower Conditions'' now said that someone in a condition of ''Enemy'' "(m)ay be restrained or imprisoned. May not be protected by any rules or laws of the group he sought to injure [...]. May not be trained or processed or admitted to any [Scientology organisation]."&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Sir John Galway|title=Enquiry into the practice and effects of scientology|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|location=London|year=1971|isbn=0-10-205272-7|oclc=301564428}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same list says that in a condition of ''Treason'', a person, "May not be protected by the rights and fair practices he sought to destroy for others. May be retrained or debarred. [...] Not covered by amnesties." Another policy letter from October that year announces:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order. It causes bad public relations. This [policy letter] does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of an SP."&lt;ref name="wallis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="foster" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atack|1990|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, HCOPL 21 Oct 68 ''Cancellation of Fair Game''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The church has maintained that the Fair Game policy was rescinded in 1968, because people had misinterpreted it. Spokesmen said that Hubbard's intended meaning was merely that former members could not appeal to Scientology's legal system for support or protection against anyone who might try to trick, sue or destroy them.&lt;ref name="streeter_fairgame" /&gt;&lt;ref name="On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes, Los Angeles Times, June 29, 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greenawalt" /&gt; Sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] commented that this interpretation seemed to be "contradicted by the words on the page, and by actions taken against those regarded as enemies of the movement."&lt;ref name="wallis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Roy|title=[[The Road to Total Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology]]|publisher=Heinemann Educational Books|location=London|year=1976|pages=144–145|isbn=0-435-82916-5|oclc=310565311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church continued to pursue an aggressive response to external critics, especially the [[US Government]].&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt; The doctrine of "Fair Game" was a central element of the Guardian's Office's operational policies. The original 1965 "Fair Game Law" is listed as a reference for GO staff in its confidential ''Intelligence Course'',&lt;ref&gt;Guardian Order, ''Confidential - Intelligence Course'', 9 September 1974, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; which was later entered into evidence in a US Federal court case in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;''United States vs. Mary Sue Hubbard et al.'', 493 F. Supp. 209, (D.D.C. 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; During the case Church lawyers admitted that "Fair Game" had been practiced long after its supposed cancellation in 1968.

Hubbard said in a 1976 affidavit that he had never intended to authorize harassment:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was never any attempt or intent on my part by the writing of these policies (or any others for that fact), to authorise illegal or harassment type acts against anyone.

As soon as it became apparent to me that the concept of 'Fair Game' as described above was being misinterpreted by the uninformed, to mean the granting of a license to Scientologists for acts in violation of the law and/or other standards of decency, these policies were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, affidavit of March 22, 1976, quoted in {{cite book|last=Barrett|first=David V.|title=The New Believers: A Survey of Sects, Cults and Alternative Religions|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|year=2003|page=464|isbn=1-84403-040-7|oclc=59368351}})&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As revised in 1991, Scientology's policy on the handling of "suppressive persons"&lt;ref&gt;HCO Policy Letter of 23 December 1965RB, revised 8 January 1991, ''Suppressive Acts Suppression of Scientology and Scientologists''&lt;/ref&gt; states:
:Nothing in this policy letter shall ever or under any circumstances justify any violation of the laws of the land or intentional legal wrongs. Any such offense shall subject the offender to penalties prescribed by law as well as to ethics and justice actions.

==Cases==
A series of court cases in England in the 1970s saw Fair Game being strongly criticized by senior judges. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] suggested in one case that Scientology organisations were willing to harass their critics.&lt;ref name="edge420" /&gt; They also described a case brought by the Church against author [[Russell Miller]] as a deliberate form of harassment.&lt;ref name="edge420"&gt;{{Harvnb|Edge|2002|p=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case where the Church of Scientology of California sought to block publication of a book quoting Scientology materials, [[Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley|Lord Justice Goff]] cited the Fair Game policy along with what he described as the Church's "deplorable means adopted to suppress inquiry or criticism." He concluded that publication of the materials was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edge|2002|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Berner, 1965===
According to an FDA investigation, in 1965, ex-Scientologist Charles Berner received a "Fair Game Order".  Afterwards, Berner stated he received other life-threatening letters, "indicating he should apply technique [[R2-45]] to himself. This particular technique is a route whereby an individual places a 45 caliber pistol to his head and disassociates himself from his body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonyortega.org/2015/03/17/more-proof-that-scientology-used-the-r2-45-method-to-intimidate-enemies/|title=More proof that Scientology used the ‘R2-45’ method to intimidate enemies « The Underground Bunker|author=|date=|website=tonyortega.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===L. Gene Allard, 1974===
In 1974, the Church lost a case against an ex-Scientologist named L. Gene Allard who in 1969, shortly after leaving the Church of Scientology, had been arrested on a charge of grand theft made by the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name="Allard1978" /&gt; The charge was dismissed "in the interest of justice", and Allard sued the Church for malicious prosecution.&lt;ref name="Allard1978" /&gt; At the trial, Allard's lawyer introduced the October 1967 and October 1968 "Fair Game" policy statements into evidence.&lt;ref name="Allard1978" /&gt; Allard was awarded $50,000 in compensatory damages and $250,000 in punitive damages.&lt;ref name="Allard1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allard1978" /&gt; Attorneys acting for the Church of Scientology had argued that the Fair Game policy had been canceled, was irrelevant to the suit and had not been applied to Allard.&lt;ref name="Allard1978"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology Critics Assail Aggressiveness of Church|last=Rawitch|first=Robert|author2=Gillette, Robert|date=1978-08-28|work=Los Angeles Times}} See [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/results.html?st=advanced&amp;QryTxt=&amp;type=historic&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON&amp;datetype=6&amp;frommonth=08&amp;fromday=28&amp;fromyear=1978&amp;tomonth=08&amp;today=28&amp;toyear=1978&amp;By=&amp;Title=Scientology+Critics+Assail+Aggressiveness+of+Church&amp;restrict=articles&amp;x=60&amp;y=18 official online archive].&lt;/ref&gt; An appellate court, while reducing the amount of punitive charges from $250,000 to $50,000, upheld the verdict against the Church, arguing that the church had been given ample opportunity "to produce evidence that the fair-game policy had been repealed" but had "failed to do so".&lt;ref name="Allard1978" /&gt; In July 1976, the [[California Supreme Court]] refused to review the case.&lt;ref name="Allard1978" /&gt;

===Paulette Cooper, 1976===
[[Image:Paulette cooper.jpg|thumb|Journalist [[Paulette Cooper]]]]

In [[Operation Freakout]], the Church of Scientology attempted to cause journalist and writer [[Paulette Cooper]] to be imprisoned, killed, driven to suicide or committed to a mental institution, as revenge for her publication in 1971 of a highly critical book, ''[[The Scandal of Scientology]]''. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] discovered documentary evidence of the plot and the preceding campaign of harassment during an investigation into the Church of Scientology in 1977, eventually leading to the Church compensating Cooper in an out-of-court settlement.

===Department of Health and Social Security (UK), 1979===
The Church of Scientology of California sued the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] (DHSS) in British courts for defamation. The DHSS had suggested that Scientologists were dangerous charlatans who would worsen rather than cure [[mental disorder|mental illness]].&lt;ref name="edge_dhss" /&gt; The Church demanded as part of [[discovery (law)|discovery]] that the DHSS release letters and medical records from people who had complained about the Church. [[John Stephenson (judge)|Lord Justice Stephenson]] declined the request, citing the Fair Game policy, which he believed still applied despite its name being cancelled. He was concerned that the documents would be used "not for legitimate purposes of the action but for harassment of individual patients, informants and renegades named in them, not only by proceedings for defamation against them but by threats and blackmail."&lt;ref name="edge_dhss"&gt;{{Harvnb|Edge|2002|pp=420–421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawrence Wollersheim, 1980===
[[Image:Lawrence Wollersheim.jpg|thumb|[[Lawrence Wollersheim]]]]
[[Lawrence Wollersheim]], a former Scientologist, successfully argued that he had been harassed and his photography business nearly destroyed as a result of Fair Game measures. These included getting Scientologist employees to resign, and Scientologist customers to boycott or refuse to pay him.&lt;ref name="greenawalt" /&gt; The 1986 judgment by a Los Angeles jury was upheld by the [[California Court of Appeal]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atack|1990|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; During appeals, the Church again claimed Fair Game was a "core practice" of Scientology and was thus [[United States Constitution|constitutionally]] protected "religious expression".&lt;ref name="wollersheim212calapp3d872"&gt;Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology, 212 Cal. App. 3d 872 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided that the Church's campaign "to ruin Wollersheim economically, and possibly psychologically" should be discouraged rather than protected.&lt;ref name="greenawalt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenawalt|first=Ken|title=Religion and the Constitution|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|volume=2|page=298|isbn=978-0-691-12582-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years after the start of the case, the Church paid Wollersheim a judgment, with interest, that amounted to [[United States dollar|US$]]8,674,643.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard |last=Leiby |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A63143-2002May9 |title=Ex-Scientologist Collects $8.7 Million In 22-Year-Old Case |work=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A03 |date=May 10, 2002 |accessdate=2006-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jakob Anderson, 1981===
In the March 11–16, 1981, Danish court case of ''Jakob Anderson vs The Church Of Scientology of Denmark'', ex-Guardian's Office operative Vibeke Damman testified that the Church did in fact practice Fair Game and had done so in Anderson's case, in an attempt to get Anderson committed to a psychiatric hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xenu.net/archive/go/legal/damman.htm|title=Transcript of testimony of Ms. Vibeke Damman, Oslo|author=|date=|website=xenu.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gerald Armstrong, 1984===
[[File:Gerry Armstrong.jpg|thumb|[[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]], Hubbard's archivist]]

In 1980, Scientologist and [[Sea Org]] officer [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]] was assigned to organize some of Hubbard's personal papers as the basis for a biography of Hubbard. Omar Garrison, a non-Scientologist known to be sympathetic to Scientology, was hired to write the biography. Both Armstrong and Garrison quickly realized that the papers reflected unfavorably on Hubbard, and revealed that many of Hubbard's claimed accomplishments were exaggerations or outright fabrications. Garrison abandoned the project, and a disillusioned Armstrong and his wife left the Church, retaining copies of the embarrassing materials as insurance against the expected harassment to come.&lt;ref name="Millions"&gt;{{cite web| first = Robert | last = Lindsey | title = Scientology chief got millions, ex-aides say | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A17F9385D0C728DDDAE0894DC484D81 | work=The New York Times| date = July 11, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Armstrong was sued by the Church in 1982 for the theft of private documents. The "Fair Game" policy became an issue in court. Armstrong won the case, in part because the Judge ruled that Armstrong, as a Scientologist of long standing, knew that fair game was practiced, and had good reason to believe that possession of these papers would be necessary to defend himself against illegal persecution by the Church.&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{cite web|first=Joel |last=Sappell |author2=Welkos, Robert W. |title=The Mind Behind the {{Sic|Reli|gon|nolink=y}} |url=http://www.latimes.com/la-scientology062490,0,7104164,full.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 24, 1990 |accessdate=2008-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308182404/http://www.latimes.com/la-scientology062490%2C0%2C7104164%2Cfull.story |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a scathing decision, Judge Paul Breckenridge wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to violating and abusing its own members' civil-rights, the organization over the years with its "Fair Game" doctrine has harassed and abused those persons not in the Church whom it perceives as enemies.

===Latey judgment, 1984===
A child custody case in London's [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] examined the culture of Scientology to investigate the risks to children being raised within it. Stating his conclusions in a public hearing, [[John Latey (judge)|Mr. Justice Latey]] read some of Scientology's internal documents into the record.&lt;ref name="atack_latey"&gt;{{Harvnb|Atack|1990|pp=335–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sinister"&gt;{{cite news|work=The Times |publisher= |title=Judge brands Scientology 'sinister' as mother is given custody of children |date=July 24, 1984 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the alleged cancellation of Fair Game, he reported that, "Deprival of property, injury by any means, trickery, suing, lying or destruction have been pursued throughout and to this day with the fullest possible vigour."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Atack|1990|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, he cited the case of a doctor at [[Harvard Medical School]] who at one point was regarded as the Church's "Number One Enemy".&lt;ref name="atack_latey" /&gt; The Church had persecuted him by stealing his employment records from a hospital, launching frivolous lawsuits against him and tracking down his patients and neighbors. The [[Citizens' Commission on Human Rights]], which Latey described as "a Scientology 'front'", made multiple complaints of misconduct against the doctor.&lt;ref name="atack_latey" /&gt;

===Pat Broeker, 1989===

&lt;blockquote&gt;I later learned, a copy of my personal credit report&amp;nbsp;– with detailed information about my bank accounts, home mortgage, credit-card payments, home address and Social Security number&amp;nbsp;– had been illegally retrieved from a national credit bureau called [[Trans Union]]. The sham company that received it, "Educational Funding Services" of Los Angeles, gave as its address a mail drop a few blocks from Scientology's headquarters. The owner of the mail drop is a private eye named Fred Wolfson, who admits that an Ingram associate retained him to retrieve credit reports on several individuals. Wolfson says he was told that Scientology's attorneys "had judgments against these people and were trying to collect on them." He says now, "These are vicious people. These are vipers."  Ingram, through a lawyer, denies any involvement in the scam. …  After that, however, an attorney [[subpoena]]ed me, while another falsely suggested that I might own shares in a company I was reporting about that had been taken over by Scientologists (he also threatened to contact the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]).  A close friend in Los Angeles received a disturbing telephone call from a Scientology staff member seeking data about me&amp;nbsp;– an indication that the cult may have illegally obtained my personal phone records.  Two detectives contacted me, posing as a friend and a relative of a so-called cult victim, to elicit negative statements from me about Scientology. Some of my conversations with them were taped, transcribed and presented by the church in [[affidavit]]s to TIME's lawyers as "proof" of my bias against Scientology.&lt;ref name=Behar /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Carmen Llywelyn, 2002===
Actress and photographer [[Carmen Llywelyn]] was introduced to the [[Church of Scientology]] through her partner (and future husband) professional skateboarder and actor [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]].  In 2015, Llywelyn penned an article entitled "Why I Left Scientology".  According to her account, when she revealed to her [[talent manager]] that she had read ''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'', a book critical of the Church, she was labeled a [[Suppressive Person]] and shunned (or "disconnected") by her friends within the church. Llywelyn's manager, a member of the Church, also "disconnected" and allegedly convinced [[United Talent Agency]] to drop Llywelyn as a client.&lt;ref name="gawker.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Llywelyn |first1=Carmen |title=Why I Left Scientology |url=http://gawker.com/why-i-left-scientology-1703997050 |accessdate=2 January 2016 |work=Gawker |date=23 June 2015 |language=en-US |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623224621/http://gawker.com/why-i-left-scientology-1703997050 |archivedate=23 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Llwelyn reports being subjected to a campaign of surveillance and harassment. Writes Llywelyn: "Scientology has a sophisticated intelligence agency known as the [[Office of Special Affairs]], which is essentially a complex system dedicated to ruining the lives of those it sees as enemies in any way possible. Those who work for the OSA do not follow the law."&lt;ref name="gawker.com"/&gt;

Sweeney also claimed that his family and neighbours had been harassed by unidentified strangers back in the UK, including an intruder at his wedding who fled when confronted.&lt;ref name=videorow&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Sweeney |title=Row over Scientology video |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6650545.stm |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-05-14 |accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark and Monique Rathbun, 2009===
[[File:Mark Rathbun.jpg|thumb|Former senior executive [[Mark Rathbun]]]]
[[Mark Rathbun|Mark C. "Marty" Rathbun]], a former senior executive of the Church of Scientology, left the organization in 2004. A one-hour feature titled ''Scientologists at War'' was broadcast on June 17, 2013, on British [[Channel Four]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/scientologists-at-war|title=Channel 4: Scientologists at War|work=Channel 4|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature, a rare insider view of the Church of Scientology, investigated the pressure tactics used by the "Squirrel Busters" affiliated to the organization to discredit and silence members who leave the church. It highlighted the story of Mark Rathbun, his role in Scientology, his fall out with Scientology leader David Miscavige, his attempts to further the cause of an independent Scientology movement, his confrontations with the "Squirrel Busters" and the repercussions on his family life.

==In practice==
An "Ethics Order" dating from March 6, 1968, issued by L. Ron Hubbard aboard his boat the ''Royal Scotsman'', lists twelve Scientologists who were accused of distributing altered versions of upper level materials. Hubbard writes "They are fair game. No amnesty may ever cover them. [...] Any Sea Org member contacting them is to use [[R2-45|Auditing Process R2-45]].".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=L.

It later emerged that "Fair Game" had actually continued in use until at least 1980, despite its cancellation, and there have been frequent allegations that it has remained in force since then. During the 1970s the [[Guardian's Office]] (GO) of the Church of Scientology, headed by Hubbard's wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard|Mary Sue]], conducted a wide-ranging and systematic series of espionage and intimidation operations against perceived enemies of Scientology. (See [[Operation Freakout]] for a noteworthy example.)

According to an ''[[American Lawyer]]'' investigation, "Fair Game" tactics had been used to force the withdrawal of the presiding judge in an attempt to "throw" the case.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gerryarmstrong.org/50grand/media/am-lawyer-1980.html Scientology's War Against Judges]", ''American Lawyer'', December 1980&lt;/ref&gt; As the US Government's attorneys put it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Defendants, through one of their attorneys, have stated that the fair game policy continued in effect well after the indictment in this case and the conviction of the first nine co-defendants. Defendants claim that the policy was abrogated by the Church's Board of Directors in late July or early August, 1980, only after the defendants' personal attack on [[Charles Richey|Judge Richey]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sentencing Memorandum of the United States of America, Mary Sue Hubbard et al., Criminal Case No. 78-401, 3 December 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The abrogation mentioned above was issued in a policy letter of 22 July 1980, "Ethics, Cancellation of Fair Game, more about", issued by the Boards of Directors of the Churches of Scientology. However, this cancellation was itself cancelled in a subsequent HCO Policy Letter of 8 September 1983, "Cancellation of Issues on Suppressive Acts and PTSes", which cancelled a number of HCOPLs on the ground that they "were not written by the Founder [Hubbard]". In two subsequent court cases the Church defended "Fair Game" as a "core practice of Scientology", and claimed that it was therefore protected as "religious expression".&lt;ref name="flinnp4032"&gt;Frank K. Flinn testimony in Church of Scientology of California, 1984, vol.23, pp.4032-4160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wollersheimb023193"&gt;Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology of California, Court of Appeal of the State of California, civ.no.B023193, 18 July 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a number of ex-Scientologists who formerly held senior management positions in the Church have alleged that while working for the Church they saw "Fair Game" tactics continuing to be used. In 1994, [[Vicky Aznaran]], who had been the Chairman of the Board of the [[Religious Technology Center]] (the Church's central management body), claimed in an affidavit that
:Because of my position and the reports which regularly crossed my desk, I know that during my entire presidency of RTC "fair game" actions against enemies were daily routine. Apart from the legal tactics described below, the "fair game" activities included break-ins, libel, upsetting the companies of the enemy, espionage, harassment, misuse of confidential communications in the folders of community members and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Aznaran affidavit, quoted in Tom Voltz, ''[http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/germany/books/swoe13.htm Scientology with(out) an End]'', chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Janie Peterson, a former Scientologist, testified in a [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater City]] hearing in 1982 that while working in the Guardians Office she had conducted smear campaigns against Church opponents, sometimes using information from confidential confessional files.&lt;ref name="witnesses" /&gt; A lawyer for the Church denounced the hearings as a "witch hunt".&lt;ref name="witnesses"&gt;{{cite news|title=Witnesses Tell of Break-ins, Conspiracy|last=Girardi|first=Steven |date=May 9, 1982|work=Clearwater Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The former scientologist stated that the Fair Game policy still applied despite the cancellation of the name.

===In the United Kingdom===
{{See also|Scientology in the United Kingdom}}
In the UK, targets of Fair Game and related harassment over the years have included ex-members, authors, journalists, broadcasters, the mental health profession, cult-monitoring groups, government and law enforcement.

Maurice William Johnson was a Scientologist who resigned in June 1966 and successfully sued for his money back. He told a court that after leaving he had received over 100 abusive letters, many of them using violent language. An article in ''The Auditor'', a Scientology publication, was produced to the court, stating outright that Johnson was "fair game" and describing him as "an enemy of mankind, the planets and all life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology is slammed in court as "evil cult"|publisher=East Grinstead Observer|date= June 13, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology "brainwash': JP's comment as ex-student is cleared of theft|publisher=East Grinstead Courier|date=June 13, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Atack]], an ex-Scientologist who left in 1983, wrote the book "[[A Piece of Blue Sky|A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed]]" and the pamphlet "The Total Freedom Trap" as well as providing research for "[[Bare-Faced Messiah]]". He provided help to other members in leaving the organisation, as well as acting as an expert witness in various cases concerning Scientology. In response, Atack's home was repeatedly picketed by placard-carrying Scientologists over the course of six days. Eugene Ingram, a private investigator employed by the Church, made visits to Atack, his elderly mother and other family and friends, spreading rumours that Atack would be going to prison. Scientologists also distributed leaflets entitled "The Truth about Jon Atack", implying that he was a drug dealer who only criticised Scientology for money.&lt;ref name="palmer_intimidation"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cult Accused of Intimidation|work=Sunday Times|publisher=Times Newspapers|date=April 3, 1994|last=Palmer|first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evening Argus ''Victims Who Are Fair Game'' April 12, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientologists picket house|publisher=East Grinstead Courier|date=March 18, 1994|last=Thompson|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atack eventually went bankrupt due to the cost of defending himself against legal action from the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Writer is quizzed by creditors'' Nottingham Evening Post 27 April 1996&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Baroness Sharples]] speaking in the [[House of Lords]], a number of ex-Scientologists "have been both threatened and harassed and a considerable number of them have been made bankrupt by the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peer declares Scientology membership|publisher=Press Association|date=December 17, 1996|last=Evans|first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He recounted the case of a Scientologist who had been accused of stealing documents from [[Saint Hill Manor]], and was told in writing that he was a [[suppressive person]] and Fair Game. The man's wife told Bracchi, "For months after, we had anonymous notes delivered in the post almost daily. They said, 'You bastard,' 'You're dead,' 'Nothing will save you.' It was terribly frightening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology is not a church or charity.

'''Faith Community Nursing''', also known as '''Parish Nursing''', '''Parrish Nursing''', '''Congregational Nursing''' or '''Church Nursing''', is a movement of over 15,000 [[registered nurse]]s, primarily in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nursingworld.org |title=American Nurses Association |publisher=Nursingworld.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also Parish nurses in [[Australia]], the Bahamas, Canada, England, Ghana, India, Kenya, [[Korea]], Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, [[New Zealand]], Nigeria, Palestine, Pakistan, Scotland, Singapore, [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], Ukraine, Wales, Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]].  Faith community nursing is a practice specialty that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit, promotion of an integrative model of health and prevention and minimization of illness within the context of a [[community of faith]]. The intentional integration of the practice of faith with the practice of [[nursing]] so that people can achieve wholeness in, with, and through the population which faith community nurses serve.

Parish nursing began in the mid-1980s in Chicago through the efforts of Rev. Dr. [[Granger E. Westberg|Granger Westberg]] as a reincarnation of the faith community nursing outreach done by religious orders, such as the "Parish Deaconesses" in Europe and America in the 1800s.  Parish nursing is rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, and the historic practice of professional nursing, and is consistent with the basic assumptions of many faiths that we care for self and others as an expression of God's love. However, it is not only available to Christian congregations.  There are Jewish Congregational Nurses, Muslim Crescent Nurses, and RNs serving in similar capacities within other faith traditions.

Faith Community Nursing (FCN) is recognized as a [[Nursing specialties|specialty nursing practice]]. ''Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice'' was approved by the [[American Nurses Association]] in 2005 (and updated in 2012) and define the specialty as "...the specialized practice of professional nursing that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit as part of the process of promoting holistic health and preventing or minimizing illness in a faith community." (American Nurses Association, 2012, Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, Silver Springs, MD: Author, p1). The 16 standards of Faith Community Nursing Practice reflect the specialty's professional values and priorities and provide practice directions and the framework for practice evaluation.  Each standard is measurable by a set of specific competencies that serve as evidence of minimal compliance with that standard.

To become a faith community nurse, the registered nurse must have a minimum of 2 years experience, must have a current license in the state where the faith community is located, and have completed a parish nurse foundations course for the specialty practice as recognized by the American Nurses Association.  There are several different curriculum offerings for the faith community nurse which have been developed by a panel of nursing faculty.  These are offered though a partnership with the International Parish Nurse Resource Center (IPNRC) at more than 130 nursing schools and health systems around the US and abroad.

Faith community nurses serve in several roles, including:
•	Health advisor
•	Educator on health issues
•	Visitor of church members at home or in the hospital
•	Provider of referrals to community resources and provide assistance in obtaining needed health services
•	Developer of support groups within the church
•	Trainer and coordinator of volunteers
•	Provider of health screenings

It is important to note that faith community nurses are not expected to provide patient care in the church or at a patient's home but rather to be a source of referrals for services in the community.  They coordinate existing services and supplement them with a holistic dimension of health and caring.
A parish nurse program or faith community nurse program can operate in several different ways.  Models include: 1) one church supporting its own full or part-time nurse, 2) several churches supporting one nurse, 3) a group of volunteer nurses supporting one or several churches or 4) a nurse related to a hospital or clinic who supports a church or churches as part of his or her job.  Of the several thousand faith community nurses, only about 35% in the US are compensated financially for their ministry. In the United States, faith community nurses typically belong to the Health Ministries Association which is the national professional membership organization for faith community nurses.  They also have available the International Parish Nurse Resource Center and the American Nurses Association, among others.

The Caribbean has joined the community of Parish Nursing and Health Care Ministry with the launching of Health Care Ministry in The Bahamas.  It began with an initial course spanning a three-week period and brought together nurses from various denominations who were commissioned on 27 February 2005. Initially, the Canadian and Australian models of Parish Nursing were introduced to The Bahamas as an extension of the Pastoral Care Ministries of Diocese 2000 &amp; Beyond, a programme of the Anglican Diocese of The Bahamas and Turks &amp; Caicos Islands. To date, more than 60 people have been trained and actively engaged in the ministry as either Parish Nurses or Health &amp; Wellness Carers.

Since the ministry began in 2005 it has grown steadily and was known as the Anglican Diocesan Health Care Ministry [Parish Nursing] Council.  However, effective 7 March 2008 the name changed to the Ecumenical Health Care Ministry Council. It is intended that there will be continued training and that the programme will spread throughout the Commonwealth of The Bahamas and the Caribbean.  To this end, the ministry will be recognised by the Bahamas Christian Council and by extension the Caribbean Council of Churches (Ecumenical Health Care Ministry, Bahamas).

The '''Himavanta''' ({{lang-th|หิมพานต์}}; {{RTGS|Himmaphan}}) is a legendary forest which surrounds the base of [[Mount Meru]] in [[Hindu mythology]]. It is said to be the home of an assortment of mythical creatures, such as ''[[Nāga]]'', ''[[Kinnara]]'', ''[[Apsonsi]]'', ''[[Zawgyi (alchemist)|Zawgyi]]'' and ''[[Garuda]]''. 

The mythical [[Nariphon]] tree of [[Buddhist mythology]], often mentioned in [[Thai folklore]], is said to grow there.

The '''imperial examination'''  was a [[civil service]] [[examination system]] in [[Imperial China]] designed to select the best potential candidates to serve as administrative officials, for the purpose of recruiting them for the state's bureaucracy. With the avowed purpose of testing and selecting candidates for merit, the examination system markedly influenced various aspects of society and culture in Imperial China, including '''[[Chinese mythology]]'''.

The imperial civil service examinations were designed as objective measures to evaluate the educational attainment and merit of the examinees, as part of the process by which to make selections and appointments to various offices within the structure of the government of the Chinese empire, or, sometimes, during periods of Chinese national disunion, of offices within the various states. During more recent historical times, successful candidates could receive the '''jinshi''' ('''chin-shih'''), and other [[Imperial examination#Details of the imperial examination|degrees]], generally followed by assignment to specific offices, with higher level degrees and competitive ranking within the degrees tending to lead to higher ranking placements in the imperial government service. The examination system developed largely in response to religious and philosophical ideas about ideal social order. Also, traditional Chinese religion and philosophy responded to concerns about the examination system. Both processes were intimately bound together with a literary system and other traditions which had a relative continuity of several thousand years. The actual examination process developed together with various related philosophical, religious, and narrative concepts to produce a distinct mythological motif.

==Sacred origins==
A common mythological motif provides a religious type of sacredness to later social institutions by projecting their origins back to a time when deities and [[culture hero]]es were credited with having divinely or miraculously created them, thus giving them an aura of greater-than-human qualities, and a justification for their existence and structural qualities with an implication that these are things which mere mortals should not question (as well as avoiding giving credit for their institution to a preceding rival dynasty). This applies particularly to the Chinese system of examinations to recruit government officials and to the related institutions of governmentally sponsored and controlled education.

==Origin myth: Shun's succession==
The first instance tantamount to an idea of imperial examination is mentioned in the ''[[Shang shu]]'' ("Yao dian" 堯典), long before a whole bureaucracy of testing was developed.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 413.&lt;/ref&gt; The text describes [[Emperor Yao]]'s intent of examining abilities of his successor. Yao, one of the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] (traditional dates of rule approximately 2852-2070 BC), saw commencement of the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]]. As he grew old in age, the Emperor Yao perceived that he would not live long enough to see the end of the flood. Therefore, he began to seek a successor, someone worthy enough and capable enough to rescue the people from this great calamity. Yao did not turn to the patriarchal system of choosing one of his sons. Yao wished to find the most talented and worthy person in the kingdom. Yao offered his throne to [[Four Mountains]], but Four Mountains declined. Instead, they recommended [[Emperor Shun|Shun]]. At the time, Shun is said to have been at home displaying [[filial piety]]. Despite this evidence of his virtue, and the recommendation of Four Mountains, Yao decided that in order to recruit a replacement for the highest of the civil service offices, that of emperor himself, it would only be prudent to instigate a series of tests. The tests included marrying Shun to his two daughters, [[Xiang River goddesses|Fairy Radiance (Ehuang) and Maiden Bloom (Nüying)]], to see whether Shun could maintain family harmony at home, and ended by sending him down from the mountains to the plains below where Shun had to face fierce winds, thunder, and rain during the course of some test of unexplained mystery. Candidate Shun successfully passed this series of imperial examinations&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Lihui, 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt; and was recruited as emperor, serving, it is said, as co-emperor, until the death of Yao.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 65-105.&lt;/ref&gt; Shun and Yao both became mythological [[cultural hero]]es, due, in part, to their fight against the flood, and helping the people to lead better lives. The story of how Yao chose Shun by seeking and testing for the most virtuous and meritorious person in the whole empire became a mainstay of [[Confucian]] discourse, with Yao and Shun being glorified as epitomes of virtue. A likewise pattern, glorifying [[Meritocracy|merit]] on the expense of the family ties, is described in succession of Shun by [[Yu the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;''Shang shu'', "Da Yu mo" 大禹謨 [http://ctext.org/shang-shu/counsels-of-the-great-yu].&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in later mythology and folk religion, the stories of the examinations of the dead in Heaven or Hell show certain parallels, in the way [[Chinese folk religion]] typically depicts the non-mundane world and the world of humans to mirror each other.

==Triennial examination tradition==
Shun is also credited with a universal gathering of his nobles and subjecting them to imperial examination every 3 years, in order to decide about promotions, demotions, or retaining of the current status in the governance structure.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music Bureau==
{{Further|Music Bureau}}

During the later dynastic history of China, there existed a government [[Music Bureau]] (most notably during a certain during part of the Han Dynasty, during the Tang dynasty, and perhaps similarly in the Qin dynasty): this was an institution involving the setting of standards and competitive evaluations thereby. In mythology, this involves one of the motifs which provide a religious-type of sacrality to the institution. The Music Bureau, or Ministry of Music was actually not a music academy in the modern sense: its function included the collection and composition of music and poetry for royal court functions of entertainment and religious rites, but its functionality was much more. The tradition behind the ''[[Shijing]]'' poetry anthology was that the reason that poems (and presumably accompanying musical scores and choreography, now lost) were collected, polished, and brought to court for presentation to the emperor was to inform him of the thoughts, feelings, and conditions of the various peoples in different parts of the empire. That tradition that [[Confucius]] himself served as the editor-in-chief of the ''Shijing'' provided great prestige to this concept, together with several explicit comments commending the results in the Confucian classics. The Han dynasty Music Bureau was also explicitly avowed to serve a similar function. This was not the only educational function attributed to the Music Bureau: even going back to the early mythological tradition, the original Ministry of Music was founded by the demi-god Emperor Shun, in order to teach propriety and harmony to his heirs apparent. Thus, a certain moral function was built into the tradition from its origins.

In mythology, the original Ministry of Music was founded by the demi-god Emperor Shun, in order to teach propriety and harmony to his heirs apparent. Thus, the mythological foundation (sometimes considered to be the legendary historical foundation) of the Chinese educational system) and the original archetype later cited by scholar-officials responsible in historical times for public administration institutional design was told in the story of Shun, and how he arranged his government, including a Music Ministry (Wu, 255-256). The work of the Music Bureau was eventually incorporated into the testing curriculum of the imperial examination system.

==Zhou selection of the worthy and the capable==
The existence of the [[Zhou dynasty]] is a historically-proven fact, as are the literary phenomena associated with this dynasty. However, much of the material about it is also known to be mythological, and some remains indeterminate. The rites and records known from the Zhou era do include a prototypical imperial examination system.

===Myth versus history===
Traditional Chinese-source scholarship regarding ancient China typically involves a dual tradition: a historicizing tradition that results in scholarship such as [[K. C. Wu]]'s, which removes the unicorns from the writings of [[Confucius]] by implying that this was merely an artifact of his final senile descent towards death, saying that when this prime example of a mythological beast appeared in the works of Confucius, it caused him to "lay down his pen and write no more" and that "[h]e died two years later" (Wu, 6); and to go on to similarly strip other mythological elements out of the ancient writings in order to provide a history of the rise of the Zhou dynasty which lacks much from the preserved accounts (that is, it preserves the historical—especially that confirmed by the [[oracle bones]] and other archeology—and rejects the embedded mythology); and, also there is the mythologizing and popular culture versions such as that the Ji family that founded the Zhou dynasty was the result of [[Jiang Yuan]]'s supernatural conception of [[Houji]] or the ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' version that allows the rise of Zhou to revolve around the interactions of the goddess [[Nüwa]], a [[Huli jing|fox spirit]] with [[Huli jing|nine tails]] that is a thousand years old, a [[Jiutou Zhiji Jing|nine-headed pheasant]], a [[Pipa Jing|jade pipa]] (a musical instrument capable of assuming human form), and so on. [[King Wen of Zhou]] (the name and title "king", ''wang'', were posthumously conferred) was also known as the Literate Duke of Zhou, and he is credited in the dual tradition as the founder of many Chinese institutions, including the ''Biyong'' academy with a teaching staff of 3 elders plus 5 various others and a system of universal recruitment into service based upon merit which involved examinations, posthumously regarded as "imperial" (Wu, 256).

==Confucian rationalism==
[[File:Zhong Kui the Demon Queller with Five Bats.jpg|thumb|Zhong Kui the Demon Queller with Five Bats]]
From a certain viewpoint, the examination system represented the most rationalistic aspect of the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] system. The system of testing was designed according to the principle of a society ruled by men of merit, and to achieve this by objectively measuring various candidates knowledge and intelligence. However, in actual operation, the system also aspects of religious and irrational beliefs more complex than this (Yang, C. K., 265-266). The idea of Fate is a mythological motif which had a significant role in the cultural context of the examination system involving cosmic forces which predestine certain results of human affairs: particularly that individual success or failure is subject to the will of [[Tian|Heaven]], and that the results of taking the imperial examinations could be influenced by the intervention of various deities (Yang C. K, 265-268).

==Zhong Kui==
[[Zhong Kui]], also spelled Chung-kuei, was a deity associated with the examination system, who achieved a major posthumous promotion during the [[Tang dynasty]]. The story is that a certain scholar took the tests, and, despite his most excellent performance, which should have won him first place, he was unfairly deprived of the first place prize by a corrupt official: in response, the scholar killed himself, the act of suicide condemning him to be a [[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghost]]. Many people afraid of traveling on roads and paths that may be haunted by evil spirits have worshiped Zhong Kui as an efficacious protective deity (Christie, 60, and picture, 58).

==Naming taboo==
Some individuals were discriminated against because of their names, due to a [[naming taboo]]. For example, because the Tang dynasty poet [[Li He]]'s father's name sounded like the ''jin'', in ''jinshi'', he was discouraged from taking the tests (Hinton, 286). The claim was that if Li He was called a ''jinshi'', it would be against the rule of etiquette that a son not be called by his father's name.

==Symbology==
[[File:Eggplant abnormality.jpg|thumb|Eggplant fruit, or aubergine.]]
[[File:Chinese Mandarin LACMA M.87.263.3.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]], 18th century wooden image.]]
The symbology of the imperial examinations and that of imperial appointment to high office are much the same, as would be expected from the close relationship which they share with each other, especially in late imperial times. [[Wolfram Eberhard]] (article under title "Official", 214-216) lists a number in his ''Dictionary of Chinese Symbols'', including [[Eggplant|eggplant (or aubergine)]] (茄子, qiézi), because the fruit together with its calyx looks like a man wearing a type of cap (冠, ''guān'', which is homonymous with ''guān'', meaning "an official") -- the caps or hats were awarded to promoted officials and so symbolic of official office (Eberhard, under "Aubergine"). Also, beans, or dried bean curd ("bean curd" referring to [[tofu]]) also were used in illustrations and other symbology to represent officialdom due to the similarity in sound between ''dòu gān'' (豆乾, dried bean curd) and ''dà guān'' (大官, high official, as Eberhard discusses under "Bean"). Also, Eberhard defines the combined images of the maple (楓, ''fēng'') and a [[monkey]] (猴, ''hóu''), or [[Monkeys in Chinese culture#Art|a monkey and a horse]] (馬, ''mǎ'') as related to official government service. Also, there is the scholar (士, shì).

{{Sri Aurobindo}}
'''Integral yoga''', also called '''supramental yoga''', is the yoga-based philosophy and practice of [[Sri Aurobindo]] and ''The Mother'' ([[Mirra Alfassa]]). Integral yoga  finds all life conscious or subconscious a [[yoga]], defines the term yoga as a methodised effort towards self-perfection by the expression of the secret potentialities latent in the being and  highest condition of victory in that effort - a union of the human individual with the universal and transcendent existence which is seen partially as expressions in humans and in the cosmos. As a yoga idea, that Spirit manifests itself in a process of [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]]. The reverse process of [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] is driven toward a complete manifestation of spirit.

According to [[Sri Aurobindo]], the current status of human evolution is an intermediate stage in the evolution of being, which is on its way to the unfolding of the spirit, and the self-revelation of divinity in all things.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=1107}} Yoga is a rapid and concentrated evolution of being, which can take effect in one life-time, while unassisted natural evolution would take many centuries or many births.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1996|p=282|ps=}} Aurobindo suggests a grand program called sapta chatushtaya (seven quadrates) to aid this evolution.

==Concept of Life==
=== The two common perception of Life &amp; Reality===
Sri Aurobindo finds that there are two extreme views of life, The [[Materialism|materialists]] &amp; The [[Asceticism|Ascetics]]  
 
'''The Materialists''' : He finds materialists would only accept the existence of [[matter]] or [[force]] and deny anything else, &amp; would in their argument  find anything which is not knowable (that which would escape once thought and speech) as inert or a passive, silent Atman, an illusion or a hallucination,   this affirmation by the materialists is based on the association of the real with the materially perceptible, and becomes the basis of his assumption on all his arguments. Which Sri Aurobindo finds cannot give an impartial reasoning. Due to the above notion the materialists would refuse any further inquiry, thus never having a satisfied understanding.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|pp=7-11}} He recommends that the only way to reconcile the materialistic mind with the other truth would be to cross over the layers of inner consciousness either by objective analysis of life &amp; mind as to matter or by subjective synthesis and illumination, arrive at a state of the ultimate unity without denying the energy of the expressing multiplicity of the universe.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=9}}
He finds that the current World is in a state of [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] materialism, &amp; finds that this rationalistic movement has served human kind in a positive way, by purifying intellect from the [[dogma]]s, [[superstitions]] clearing path to a better advancement of Humanity.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=10}} Sri Aurobindo finds that root of this Scientific movement to be a search for knowledge, due to this root the movement would not come to a halt and its progress is a sure sign that it would carry forward in reaching the other part of knowledge which [[vedantins]] had found in a different way.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=13}}

'''The Ascetics''' : would only accept [[Ātman (Hinduism)|spirit/Atman]] and terming the remaining as mechanical unintelligent substance or energy, leading to believing the reality to be an illusion of senses.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=7}} Sri Aurobindo finds when the mind retracts from external activities and has experience of silence, a powerful convincing experience that only the pure self or non-being is real leads them to disregard the outer world. 
he finds this as an revolt of spirit on matter which was made famous by [[Buddhism]] affirming that it is impossible  to find a solution in the [[Reality|world]] which is termed to be dual in nature, but to escape into [[Nirvana]], [[Brahmaloka]] or [[Goloka]] as beyond. He finds that this approach is slowly coming to an end and had its importance as the part of evolution, but is quite different than what was present in Vedic period.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|pp=13-28}}

''' Integral yoga's take on Reality''':
Sri Aurobindo finds that a compromise between the two approaches would be a bargain &amp; would not be a true reconciliation, but only a unified Spirit &amp; Matter would be a basis for Integral yoga's  path to understanding of reality.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=25}} He finds the [[Anatta|non being]] at one end which seems opposite to the manifested universe are not opposites which would deny other's existence, but rather are different states of reality with opposite affirmations. Sri Aurobindo finds that the highest experience of the Reality to be a conscious Existence, a supreme Intelligence, Force and a self-existent Bliss; He finds a liberated intelligence &amp; experience would bring about this highest understanding of the reality.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=32}}

=== Humanity and its purpose ===

Integral yoga rejects notion of reality being a purposeless illusion or a result of an accident nor a deceptive trick of mind but an existence aware of itself, realises itself in form &amp; unfolds itself in the individual, an existence which already exists as an all-revealing &amp; all-guiding truth of things first movements would be without the knowledge of its conscious mind but a general movement of nature &amp; later consciously by a progressive awakening &amp; self enlargement, to his divine ascension &amp; finds  this ascent of life to divine life is the human journey and his prime purpose of life. {{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=47-48|ps=}} 

====Involution====
{{Main|Involution (esoterism)}}

Involution is the extension of Spirit, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], to create a universe of separate forms. Being manifests itself as a multiplicity of forms, meanwhile becoming lost in the inconscience of matter.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' Bk I, Ch.11-12&lt;/ref&gt; The first manifestation of Spirit in the process of involution is as ''[[Satchitananda]]'', and then as Supermind, the intermediate link between the higher (Spirit) and lower (matter, life, and mind) nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aurobindo the world is a differentiated unity. It is a manifold oneness, that generates an infinite variety of lifeforms and substances. The lifeforms and substances are stretched out on a wide range, from physical matter to a pure form of spiritual being, where the subject becomes fully aware of itself as spirit:{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=254-255|ps=}}  
* [[Matter|Material]]- a submerged consciousness concealed in its action and losing itself in the form.
* [[Vitalism|Vital]]- an emerging consciousness, a consciousness half delivered out of its original imprisonment which has become of vital craving and satisfaction or repulsion.     
* [[Mind|Mental]]- an emerged consciousness reflecting fact of life in a mental sense, perceptive and ideative. It modifies the internal and attempts to modify conformably the external existence of the being.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=221|ps=}}

Above Mind proper lie various higher levels of Mind, which ascend toward Spirit.

==== Evolution ====
Through evolution Spirit rediscoveres itself as Spirit. Evolution follows a developmental trajectory from the original inconscience of matter into life, to mind, and then to spiritualized mind, culminating in [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|The Supermind]] or Truth Consciousness.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=254-255|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' bk II, ch.27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution is [[Teleology|teleological]],{{sfn|Giri|2014|p=59}}{{sfn|Miśra|1998|p=414}} since the developing entity contains within itself already the totality toward which it develops.{{sfn|Miśra|1998|p=414}} It is not a mechanistic or deterministic teleology,{{sfn|Miśra|1998|p=414}}{{sfn|Giri|2014|p=59}} but a "manifestation of all the possibilities inherent in the total movement."{{sfn|Giri|2014|p=59}}

==== The goal of integral yoga ====
The goal of Integral yoga is to become aware of the Divine, to integrate the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of ourselves, and to manifest the Divine at earth.{{sfn|Vrinte|1996|p=140}} According to Sri Aurobindo, all life is Yoga, while Yoga as a [[sadhana]] is a methodised effort towards self-perfection, which brings to expression the latent, hidden potentialities of being. Success in this effort unifies the human individual with the universal and transcendental Existence.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=6}} Integral yoga reunites "the infinite in the finite, the timeless in the temporal and the transcendent with the immanent.

===Three types of being ===
Sri Aurobindo discerns three types of being, namely the Outer being, the Inner being, and the Psychic Being.

====The Outer Being====
The Outer Being includes the physical, vital and mental levels of Being, which characterises our everyday consciousness and experience. It includes several levels of the subconscient: a mental subconscient, a vital subconscient, and a physical subconscient, down to the material Inconscient.&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt; Integral Yoga involves going beyond this surface consciousness to the larger life of the Inner Being, which is more open to spiritual realisation.

====The Inner or Subliminal Being====
The Inner Being, or Subliminal,{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}}{{sfn|Vrinte|2002|p=235}} includes the inner realms or aspects of the physical, vital and mental being. They have a larger, subtler, freer consciousness than that of the everyday consciousness. Its realisation is essential for any higher spiritual realisation.

The Inner Being is also transitional between the surface or Outer Being and the Psychic or Inmost Being. By doing yoga practice ([[sadhana]]), the inner consciousness is being opened, and life turns away from the outward to the inward. The inner consciousness becomes more real than the outer consciousness, and becomes a peace, happiness and closeness to the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''Letters on Yoga'', 3rd ed. 1971, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Psychic Being====
The Psychic Being is Sri Aurobindo's term for the Personal [[Spiritual evolution|Evolving]] [[Soul]], the principle of [[The Divine|Divine]] spirit in every individual.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], the term "Psychic" or Psychic Being is derived from the [[Occultism|occult]] [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] teachings of [[Max Theon|Max Théon]].&lt;ref name="The Life Divine' p. 227"&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' p.&amp;nbsp;227 note&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Aurobindo distinguishes between the Psychic Being as being defined in his Integral Yoga, and the ordinary meaning of "psychic," which refers more to [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomena, or to [[paranormal]] phenomena, which are connected with the subtle physical layers.&lt;ref name="The Life Divine' p. 227"&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' p.&amp;nbsp;227 note&lt;/ref&gt;
}} The Psychic is the "Innermost Being",{{refn|group=note|[[Amal Kiran]]&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hamilton [http://www.auroville.com/vijnana/spiritual/soulpower.htm The Miraculous Power of the Soul - A meeting with Amal Kiran, Pondicherry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611012237/http://www.auroville.com/Vijnana/spiritual/soulpower.htm |date=2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the permanent being in us that stands behind and supports the physical, vital and mental principles. It "uses mind, life and body as its instruments," undergoing their fate yet also transcending them.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' p.&amp;nbsp;891&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Integral Yoga]] the goal is to move inward and discover the Psychic Being, which then can bring about a transformation of the outer nature. This transformation of the outer being or ego by the Psychic is called Psychicisation; it is one of the three necessary stages in the realisation of the Supramental consciousness. This Psychic transformation is the decisive movement that enables a never-ending progress in life, through the power of connecting to one's inner spirit or Divine Essence. The Psychic begins its evolution completely veiled and hidden, but grows through successive lifetimes, and gradually exerts a greater influence, taking on the role of spiritual Guide.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' pp.&amp;nbsp;891–4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central being====
'''Central Being''' refers to the [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] and eternal [[spirit]], as opposed to the incarnate and [[spiritual evolution|evolving]] [[Soul]], which he calls the [[Psychic Being]]. Sometimes it refers to both of them together as the essential spiritual core of the being.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Letters on Yoga]]'' vol.I under "Planes and Parts of Being" (pp.&amp;nbsp;265ff in the 3rd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Being "presides over the different births one after the other but is itself unborn" (ibid p.&amp;nbsp;269). This transcendent Central Being or Spirit is also designated as the [[Jiva]] or [[Paramatman#Advaita|Jivatman]], although the meaning of these terms in Sri Aurobindo's philosophy differs greatly from that of much of conventional [[Vedanta]] (especially [[Advaita Vedanta]])

The levels of being ascend from the inconscient to the Supermind.

===Inconscient===

Inconscient Matter is the lowest level of involution.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=132}}{{sfn|The Mother|1961|p=199}} Spirit is still present in the inconscient:{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=211}} "The Inconscient is the Superconscient's sleep."&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt; The Inconscient is also the instrument of the Superconsciousness which has created the Universe.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=297}} According to Satprem, the Inconscient lies at the bottom of the physical subconscient,&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt; and "life emerged [...] at the border between the material inconscient and the physical consciousness [...] in our body.&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt;

===Subconscient and subtle or subliminal conscient===

The physical, vital and mental levels of being contain both a subconscient and a subtle or subliminal part.{{sfn|Sharma|1992|p=61-63}}

====The subconscient====

The subconscient parts are the submerged parts. It contains "obstinate [[Samskara (Indian philosophy)|samskaras]], impressions, associations, fixed notions, habitual reactions formed by the past."{{sfn|Sharma|1992|p=61}} According to Satprem, there are several levels of the subconscient, corresponding with the different levels of our being: a mental subconscient, a vital subconscient, and a physical subconscient, down to the material Inconscient.&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem"&gt;[http://www.aurobindo.ru/workings/satprem/adventure_of_consciousness_e.htm Satprem, ''Aurobindo, or the adventure of consciousness.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aurobindo, the body is partly a creation of the inconscient or subconscient.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=297}} According to The Mother, the ordinary, false consciousness, which is common to material body-consciousness, is derived from the subconscient and the inconscient.{{sfn|The Mother|1961|p=50}} According to Aurobindo, the outer being depends on the subconscient, which hinders the spiritual progress.{{sfn|Sri Aurobindo|1988}} Only by living in the inner being can this obstacle be overcome.{{sfn|Sri Aurobindo|1988}}

According to Sharma, the subconscient is "the inconscient in the proces of becoming conscient."{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}} It is a submerged part of the personality without waking consciousness, but which does receive impressions, and influences the conscious mind.{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=61}} According to Sharma, it includes the [[unconscious mind]] which is described by psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung,{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=61}} though it includes much more than the unconscious of ([[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]]) psychology.{{refn|group=note|According to Pani, the inconscient is the same as the western psycho-analytic unconscious mind, while the subconsciousness is another layer of consciousness.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=207}}}}

====The subtle or subliminal conscient====

The subtle or subliminal is the subtle, higher counterpart of the subconscient. According to Sharma, "it has an inner mind, an inner vital being, and an inner subtle physical being, wider than man's consciousness."{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}} It can directly experience the Universal, and "it is the source of inspirations, intuitions, ideas, will [...] as well as [...] telepathy [and] clearvoyance."{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}}

====Gross body ====
The gross body commonly referred to in yoga constitutes mainly of two parts the material physical body (anna[[kosha]]) and the nervous system normally refer to as vital vehicle (Prana kosha) in Integral yoga.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=10-11}}

=====Physical=====
The Physical level refers to both the [[physical body]] and the body's [[consciousness]]. The body is just as conscious as the vital and mental parts of the being, only it is a different type of consciousness. The Physical not only shades upwards to higher ontological levels, but also downwards into the Subconscient.{{refn|group=note|The Physical can be subdivided into finer sub-grades:
* the ''Physical Proper'' or pure body consciousness, which represents the consciousness of the external physical body itself.
* the ''Vital Physical'' or ''Nervous Being'' (which seems to be equivalent to the [[Etheric body]] of western [[esotericism]], and hence pertains to one of the [[Subtle body|subtle bodies]])
* the ''Mental Physical'' (similar to the Physical Mind - see "[[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]")
* the ''True physical being'' - is the [[Purusha]] of the physical level, which is like the Inner Physical larger than the surface body consciousness and in touch with the a larger spiritual consciousness.
* the ''Inner physical'' - the physical component of the [[inner being]], which is wider and more plastic than the outer physical body.  This is also called the [[subtle physical]]}}

The Subtle physical is [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s term for a subtler aspect of the physical nature. This has many qualities not found in the gross physical nature.  In ''[[Mother's Agenda|The Agenda]]'', [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] often refers to it. It might be compared to the [[etheric body]] and [[etheric plane|plane]], or even the [[astral body]] and [[astral plane|plane]]. The term "subtle physical" is used to distinguish it from gross (''sthula'') or outer material physical.{{refn|group=note|Aurobindo: "By the gross physical is meant the earthly and bodily physical - as experienced by the outward sense-mind and senses. But that is not the whole of Matter.  There is a subtle physical also with a subtler consciousness in it which can, for instance, go to a distance from the body and yet feel and be aware of things in a not merely mental or vital way.&lt;br&gt;...the subtle physical has a freedom, plasticity, intensity, power, colour, wide and manifold play (there are thousands of things there that are not here) of which, as yet, we have no possibility on earth."&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, Letters on Yoga part 1, section v&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Vital=====
The Vital level of the being refers to the [[Vitalism|life force]], but also to the various passions, desires, feelings, emotions, affects, compulsions, and likes and dislikes. These strongly determine human motivation and action through desire and enthusiasm.

Unlike Western [[psychology]], in which mind, emotions, instincts, and consciousness are all lumped together, Sri Aurobindo strongly distinguishes between the "Vital" and the "Mental" faculties.

In addition to the individual Vital faculty, Sri Aurobindo refers to a Vital Plane or Vital world, which would seem to be partly equivalent to the [[Astral Plane]] of popular [[occultism]] and [[New Age]] thought.

====Mind or Mental being====

Mind proper is the conceptual and [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[mind]]. Mind is a subordinate process of the Supermind.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=42}} It is the intermediary stage between the Divine and the mundane life.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=40-41}} It works by measuring and dividing reality, and has lost sight of the Divine.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=41}} It is the seat of ignorance, yet it is still capable of an upward ascent toward the Divine.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}}

Unlike Western psychology, in which mind and consciousness are considered the same, Sri Aurobindo strongly distinguishes between the "Mental" and the "Vital" (emotional) faculties, as well as between Mind and pure Consciousness. Sri Aurobindo in part bases his concept of the Mental on his reading of the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]], the mental being (or perhaps just the Mental Purusha) is the ''mano-maya-atma'' - the self made of mind (''manas'').

For Sri Aurobindo, Mind or the Mental being is not simple and uniform, but consists itself of various strata and subdivisions, which act at different levels of being. These various faculties are described or variously referred to, usually in obliquely or in passing, in some of his books, including ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]'', which has poetic references to many types of Mind.&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984 pp.&amp;nbsp;152–62&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters answering questions from disciples, Sri Aurobindo summarises the characteristics of the various levels of Mind.&lt;ref&gt;Aurobindo, ''[[Letters on Yoga]]'' vol. I pp.&amp;nbsp;324–5&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|A small but popular book by Jyoti and Prem Sobel, ''The Hierarchy of Minds'', comes closest to a systematic coverage of an Aurobindonian noetology by gathering all of Sri Aurobindo's references and quotes on the subject of "Mind" and arranging these according to the type of Mind. These various Minds and Mental principles of being include:&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti and Prem Sobel, ''The Hierarchy of Minds''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''''Physical Mind'''''
* ''The Mechanical Mind'' is a much lower action of the mental physical which when left to itself can only repeat the same ideas and record the reflexes of the physical consciousness in its contact with outward life and things.
* ''Mind in the physical or mental physical'' mentalises the experiences of outward life and things, sometimes very cleverly, but it does not go beyond that, unlike the externalising mind which deals with these things from the perspective of reason and its own higher intelligence.
* ''Physical Mind'' - refers to either or both the Externalising Mind and the Mental in the Physical; it is limited to a physical or [[Materialism|materialistic]] perspective, and cannot go beyond that, unless enlightened from above.
* ''Mind of Light'' - according to [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] this is the Physical Mind receiving the [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|supramental light]] and thus being able to act directly in the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mother, 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;63–64&lt;/ref&gt;
'''''Vital Mind'''''
* ''Vital Mind'' - a mediator between the vital emotions, desires, and so on the mental proper. It is limited by the vital view and feeling of things, and expresses the desires, feelings, ambitions,and other active tendencies of the vital in mental forms, such as daydreams and imaginations of greatness, happiness, and so on. As with the Externalising Mind, Sri Aurobindo associates it with the Vishuddha or Throat Chakra
'''''Mind proper'''''
* ''Mind Proper'' - is free-fold, consisting of Thinking Mind, dynamic Mind, externalising Mind.  It constitutes the sum of one's thoughts, opinions, ideas, and values, which guide conscious thinking, conceptualizing and decision-making processes, and is transformed, widened, and spiritualised through the practice of [[Integral Yoga]].
:* ''Thinking Mind'' - the highest aspect of the mind proper, concerned with ideas and knowledge in their own right.  It is equated with the [[Ajna|Ajna Chakra]]
:* ''Dynamic Mind'' - that aspect of the ordinary mind that puts out of mental forces for realisation, acting by the idea and by reason.  It is also equated with the Ajna or Brow center.
:* ''Externalising Mind'' - the most "external" part of the mind proper, concerned with the expression of ideas in speech, in life, or in any  form it can give.  It is equated with the [[Vishuddha|Vishuddha or Throat Chakra]]
'''''Higher Mind'''''
* ''Higher Mind'' - the first and lowest of the spiritual mental grades, lying above the normal mental level.
* ''Spiritual Mind'' - either the spiritualised mind, or a general term for levels of mind above the normal mental level (the "Mind Proper").
* ''Inner mind'' - the mental component of the Inner Being, which lies behind the surface mind or ordinary consciousness and can only be directly experienced by [[sadhana]]
* ''True mental being'' - is the [[Purusha]] of the mental level freed from the error and ignorance of the lower [[Prakriti]] and open to the knowledge and guidance above.
* ''Psychic Mind'' - a movement of the mind in which the [[Psychic Being]] predominates; the mind turned towards the Divine}}

Above mind proper lie various higher individual levels of mind, namely the Higher Mind, Illumined Mind, Intuitive Mind and Overmind, which ascend toward the Spirit, and provide a higher and more inclusive vision of reality:
* '''Higher Mind''' is the realm of Truth-thought. It can hold a wide range of knowledge in one vision and an integral whole.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}}{{refn|group=note|Compare Ken Wilber's Centaur or vision-logic; see [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)#Levels or stages]]}} It receives [[Illuminationism|illumination]] from the Illumined Mind,{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=45}} and is not dependent on the limited knowledge of the senses.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}} It is also capable of transforming the lower realms of body and mind, effectuating change sof habit and life.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}} Nevertheless, it is still a state of thought, in contrast to Illumined Mind, which is a state of vision and spiritual insight.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=45}}
* '''Illumined''' Mind is the mind of sight and vision. It transformes the Higher Mind by providing it a direct vision.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=47}}
* '''Intuition''' provides the illumination of thought and vision to the Higher Mind and the Illumined Mind.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=47}} Mundane mind may experience intuition too, but in the higher realms of mind it becomes more frequent an dstable.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=47}}
* '''Overmind''' is the [[Cosmic Consciousness]].{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=49}} It is the plane of [[deity|Gods]]. Overmental plane is the highest consciousness one can achieve without transcending the mental system. Beyond overmind are the planes of [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supermind]] or unity-consciousness.{{refn|group=note|A detailed description of the Overmind is provided in Book I ch.28, and Book II ch.26, of Sri Aurobindo's philosophical opus ''[[The Life Divine]]''.}}

====Supermind====
{{main|Supermind (Integral yoga)}}
Supermind is the infinite unitary Truth Consciousness or Truth-Idea beyond the three lower [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]] of [[Matter]], [[Life]], and [[Mind]]. Supermind is the dynamic form of [[Satchitananda|Sachchidananda]] (Being-Consciousness-Bliss), and the necessary mediator or link between the transcendent Sacchidananda and the creation.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''Life Divine'' Book I, ch.14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of the present being==
Humans are stuck between matter and Spirit,{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=210|ps=}} due to the habits of personality and partial awareness, which arise from Ignorance.

=== Personality  ===

Humans are accustomed to respond to certain vibrations more than other. These customs develop into one's desire, pain, feelings, which are all a set of habits. This crystallised set of habits becomes one's personality. This is normally believed to be "self". The appearance of stable personality is given by constant repetition and recurrence of the same vibrations and formations.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=210|ps=}}

===Three basic difficulties for mankind===

According to Aurobindo, humans face three basic problems:
# '''Partial [[Self-awareness]]''': humans are only aware of a small part about themselves. They are aware of the surface of mentality, physical being, and life, and not of the larger and more potent [[subconscious mind]] and hidden life impulses. 
# '''Partial [[awareness]] of other [[beings]]''': humans create a rough mental construction of their fellow beings. Their understanding is created by a mental knowledge, which is imperfect, and subjected to denial and frustration. This partial awareness can be overcome by a conscious unity. This unity can only be achieved from Supermind.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=227|ps=}}
# '''A division between Force and consciousness in evolution''': matter, life and mind are often warring with each other. Materialists try to resolve this war by submitting oneself to the mortality of our being, while ascetics have tried to reject earthly life. A true solution may lie in finding the principle beyond mind, thereby overcoming the mortality of our existence.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=228|ps=}}

===Ignorance===

The fundamental cause of falsehood, error and evil is Ignorance. Ignorance is a self-limiting knowledge, which arises with exclusive concentration in a single field. According to Aurobindo, human notion of good, bad &amp; evil are uncertain and relative.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=622|ps=}}

===Practices===
Unlike other [[Yoga]] practices ''Integral yoga'' does not propose any kind of physical asanas, breathing techniques or external movements. It is more [[psychological]] in nature, with internal reflection and self-analysis &amp; correction as main tools of development .

The main practices or approaches are divided into {{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|pp=2-30}} 
*  The yoga of divine work (yoga through ones work )
*  The yoga of Integral Knowledge ( Yoga through analysis, observation &amp; knowledge) 
*  The Yoga of Divine love ( Commonly referred to as [[Bhakti yoga]] or [[Love of God|love of god]])  
*  The Yoga of Self-Perfection (referred to as a Synthetic yoga or the triple way ) {{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=611}}

==Yogic Practise==
===The Yoga of Self-Perfection===
====The Triple Transformation====
The limitations of the present being can be overcome by the Triple transformation, the process in which the lower nature is transformed into the divine nature. It consists of the inward psychicisation by which the [[sadhaka|sadhak]] gets in contact with the inner divine principle or Psychic Being; the spiritual transformation or spiritualisation; and the Supramentalisation of the entire being.{{refn|group=note|This is described in ''[[The Life Divine]]'' part 2, ch.25, and ''[[Letters on Yoga]]'' part 4, section 1.}}

=====Psychicisation=====
Psychicisation is a turn [[Inner being|inward]], so that one realises the [[psychic being]], the psychic personality or Divine [[Soul]], in the core of one's being. The Divine Soul serves as a spiritual Guide in the yoga, and enables one to transform the [[outer being]].&lt;ref&gt;Aurobindo (1977), ''[[The Life Divine]]'' book II - chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt; It may also help avoid the dangers of the spiritual path. There is an [[intermediate zone]], a dangerous and misleading transitional [[spirituality|spiritual]] and pseudospiritual region between the ordinary consciousness and true spiritual realisation.&lt;ref name="intyoga.online.fr"&gt;[http://intyoga.online.fr/intzone.htm Sri Aurobindo's Letters on Yoga - The Intermediate Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychisiation consists of three methods. In "consecration" one opens oneself to the Force before engaging in an activity. "Moving to the Depths" (or "concentration") is a movement away from the surface existence to a deeper existence within. "Surrender" means offering all one's work, one's life to the Divine Force and Intent.&lt;ref&gt;''Synthesis of Yoga'' Part I ch. II-III&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters on Yoga'' vol. II pp.585ff (3rd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Guided by the evolving divine soul within, the sadhak moves away from ego, ignorance, finiteness, and the limitations of the [[outer being]]. It is thanks to this guidance by the Divine Soul that the [[sadhaka|sadhak]] can avoid the pitfalls of the spiritual path.

=====Spiritualisation=====
As a result of the Psychicisation, light, peace, and power descend into the body, transforming all of its parts, physical, vital, and mental. This is the Spiritual transformation, or Spiritualisation, the concretisation of the larger spiritual consciousness. It is equivalent to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|"enlightenment"]], as found in [[Vedanta]] and [[Buddhism]].

=====Intermediate zone=====
{{Main|Intermediate zone|Spiritual bypass}}

Aurobindo asserted that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, and freedom from normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intyoga.online.fr/intzone.htm Sri Aurobindo's Letters on Yoga - The Intermediate Zone]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm Grey Lodge Occult Review :: Issue #9 :: The Intermediate Zone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141007/http://greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Supramentalisation=====
Supramentalisation is the realisation of the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supermind]], or Supramental consciousness, and the resulting transformation of the entire being. Psychicisation and spirtualisation serve as necessary prerequisites for the Supramentalisation of the entire being.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', pp.281-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The supramental transformation is the final stage in the integral yoga, enabling the birth of a new individual, fully formed by the supramental power. Such individuals would be the forerunners of a new supra-humanity, grounded in truth-consciousness. All aspects of division and ignorance of consciousness, at the vital and mental levels, would be overcome, and replaced with a unity of consciousness at every plane. And even the physical body transformed and divinised. A new supramental species would then emerge, living a supramental, [[gnostic being|gnostic, divine life]] on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' book II ch.27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurobindo describes several results and different stages depicting the stages of development in integral yoga, called together the ''sapta chatushtaya'', "seven quadrates."&lt;ref group=web name="SC"&gt;[https://auromere.wordpress.com/sapta-chatushthaya/ Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, ''Sapta Chatushtaya'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.uprs.edu/upr-blog/featuresspotlight/press-releases/academic-dean-at-the-university-of-philosophical-research-publishes-new-book/ Dr. Debashish Banerji, ''Seven Quartets of Becoming: A Transformative Yoga Psychology Based on the Diaries of Sri Aurobindo''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004113644/http://www.uprs.edu/upr-blog/featuresspotlight/press-releases/academic-dean-at-the-university-of-philosophical-research-publishes-new-book/ |date=2015-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Aurobindo received these instructions as a series of mantras while he was imprisoned in Alipore prison. They were copied by Arun to use for study.&lt;ref group=web name="SC-origins"&gt;[https://auromere.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/the-origin-of-the-sapta-chatusthaya/ Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, ''The origin of the Sapta Chatusthaya'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} It consists of:.&lt;ref group=web name="SC" /&gt;
* Shanti (peace, calm), which consists of [[samatha]] (calming of the mind), [[Inner peace|shanti]] (peace), [[sukha]] (happiness), and hasya (Atmaprasada, contentment of the Atman);
* Shakti (power), which consists of [[shakti]] (the power of the primordial energy), [[virya]] (energy, effort), [[Devi|daivi]] [[prakriti]] (Divine Nature, primal force), and [[Śraddhā|sraddha]] (faith);
* [[vijnana]] (knowledge), which consists of [[jnanam]] (knowledge), trikaladrsti (knowledge of past, present and future), [[ashtasiddhi]] (eight powers), and [[samadhi]] (absorption);
* Sharira (body), which consists of arogyam (health), [[Transcendental Meditation|utthapana]] (levitation, being free from gravity and physical powers), saundaryam (beauty), [[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|vividhananda]] (bliss);
* Karma (divine work), which consists of [[Krishna]] (avatar of Vishnu), [[Kali]] (the Goddess), [[kama]] (divine delight), and [[Karma yoga|Karma]] (divine action);
* Brahma, the realization of [[Brahman]]; 
* Siddhi (realization), which consists of [[shuddhi]] (purification), [[Moksha|mukti]] (liberation), bhukti (enjoyment), and [[siddhi]] (realisation of yogic powers).

==Influence==
Aurobindo had a strong influence on [[Ken Wilber]]'s [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theory]] of [[Spiritual evolution|spiritual development]].{{sfn|Vrinte|2002}} Wilber's Causal and Ultimate stages closely resemble Aurobindo's higher mental stages, but Wilber lumps together levels of Being, types of Being and developmental stages.

[[File:Ipès.png|thumb|Ipos]]

In [[demonology]], '''Ipos''' is an Earl and powerful Prince of [[Hell]] (a Duke to some authors) who has thirty-six legions of [[demons]] under his command. He knows and can reveal all things, past, present and future (only the future to some authors, and past and future to others). He can make men witty and valiant.

He is commonly depicted with the body of an [[angel]] with the head of a [[lion]], the tail of a [[hare]], and the feet of a [[goose]], less frequently in the same shape but with the body of a [[lion]], and rarely as a [[vulture]].

''Other spellings'': Aiperos, Ayperos, Ayporos, Ipes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2124">'''Jahangir IV''' ({{lang-fa|جهانگیر}}), was the last ruler of the [[Paduspanid]] branch of [[Kojur]]. He was the son and successor of [[Sultan Mohammad ibn Jahangir]].

==Biography==
In 1593, Jahangir arrived to the court of [[Abbas I of Persia]], and established good relations with him. However, during a festival in [[Qazvin]], Jahangir killed two prominent Safavid nobles. This made Abbas invade his domains in 1598, where he besieged Kojur. Jahangir managed to flee, but was captured and killed by a Pro-Safavid Paduspanid named Hasan Lavasani, marking the end of the Paduspanid dynasty.

-not to be confused with [[John M. Hull]] (b. 1935), Emeritus Professor of Religious Education at the University of Birmingham.''

'''Rev. John Howarth Eric Hull''' (27 January 1923 - 29 November 1977) was an [[English literature|English]] [[writer]] on [[religion]]. Ordained in 1946 as a congregational [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], he held [[pastorate]]s at Oakvale, Liverpool, Timperley, Cheshire and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester.

In the 1950s, Hull commenced part-time [[education|teaching]] of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and the [[New Testament]] at the [[Lancashire Independent College]] Manchester, where he had trained as a minister. From 1961 until his death in 1977, he devoted himself full-time to teaching at what then became known as the Northern Congregational College Manchester (subsequently renamed The Congregational College Manchester). Upon its formation in 1972, Hull then became a minister of the [[United Reformed Church]].

Hull was appointed [[principal (school)|principal]] of the college in July 1977.  He died aged 54 on 29 November 1977.  His widow, Dr. Winifred Hull, a [[classics scholar]], temporarily took over the teaching of Greek, also serving as [Warden (college)|warden]] of the College until a successor could be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England and Wales Death Registration Index 1837-2007|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVCR-VWBJ|publisher=FamilySearch|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hull's most famous work was ''The Holy Spirit in the Acts of the Apostles'' (1967). In it, he argued that at [[Pentecost]], the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] only became aware of the gift of the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] they had already received.&lt;ref&gt;James D. G. Dunn Baptism in the Holy Spirit: a re-examination of the New Testament Evidence p39  1970 "JHE Hull, The Holy Spirit in the Acts of the Apostles (1967), who argues that at Pentecost the apostles only became aware of the gift of the Spirit they had already received (50, 86)."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{merge from|Sons of Mosiah|discuss=Talk:Sons of Mosiah#Merger proposal|date=July 2018}}

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Mosiah II''' ({{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|ˈ|s|aɪ|.|ə|,_|-|ˈ|z|aɪ|.|ə}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «mō-sī´a ''or'' mō-zī´a»&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Benjamin]]'s son and [[King Mosiah I|Mosiah I]]'s grandson, was king of the Nephite nation from about 124 BC to 91 BC. The [[Book of Mosiah]] is named after Mosiah II.

==Accounts==
Mosiah instituted a new governing system after all of his [[Sons of Mosiah|sons]] declined to succeed him as king, choosing rather to preach the gospel. This new government was based on judges elected and chosen by the people. After Mosiah's death in approximately 91 BC, this council of elected [[judge]]s constituted the government of the land until [[Christ]] visited the Nephite nation (see {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=29}}).

== Possible origin of the name ==
Mosiah II was presumably named after his grandfather.

[[Hugh Nibley]] relates the name to a combination of the name [[Moses]] with that of [[Yahweh]] (Jehovah).&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] root ''msy'', "child of", has been considered as a possible etymology for the name Moses, arguably an abbreviation of a [[theophoric name]], as for example in Egyptian names like [[Thutmose]]s ([[Thoth|Thoth created him]]) and [[Ramesses I|Ramesses]] ([[Ra|Ra created him]]),&lt;ref name="Hays" &gt;Christopher B. Hays, [https://books.google.it/books?id=r5W7BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 ''Hidden Riches: A Sourcebook for the Comparative Study of the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near East''], Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2014 p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; with the god's name omitted. In the case of Mosiah, the inversion of the elements could yield the combination "son of Yah".

The name is also similar to [[Isaiah]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the "-iah" suffix can be found in a number of Book of Mormon names such as [[Amalickiah]] and [[Sariah]], as well as the Biblical names [[Jeremiah]] and [[Zedekiah]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5453">'''Kurt Latte''' (9 March 1891, [[Königsberg]] – 8 June 1964, [[Tutzing]]) was a German [[classical philologist|philologist]] and classical scholar known for his work on [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]].

==Career==
The son of a doctor, Latte studied at the Universities of Königsberg, Bonn and Berlin. After taking his doctorate at Königsberg in 1913 under Ludwig Deubner with a study on cultic dance in ancient Greece, he began work on an edition of the dictionary of [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]. After service in World War I he was ''Assistent'' at the Institut für Altertumskunde of the University of Münster from 1920 to 1923, gaining his [[Habilitation]] there in 1920 with a study of Greek and Roman sacral law. In 1923 he was appointed Professor at Greifswald as successor to Johannes Mewaldts, in 1926 Professor at Basel as successor to Günther Jachmann, and in 1931 Professor at Göttingen, as successor to [[Eduard Fraenkel]]. He was forced to retire on April 1, 1936, having been classified as a Jew by the Nazis.

Having returned to Germany in 1937 from a visiting professorship in Chicago, Latte lived out the period of Nazi rule in Hamburg (where he was supported by [[Bruno Snell]]), Düsseldorf, and Osterode am Harz, where he had been invited by his erstwhile Greifswald colleague Konrat Ziegler, who hid him for a time. In 1945 he was able to resume his chair at Göttingen, but declined to endorse an appointment for Ziegler. In 1947 he was made a corresponding member of the German Academy of Sciences in Berlin. From 1949 to 1956 he was President and Vice President of the Academy of Sciences at Göttingen, as well as chairman of the Mommsen-Gesellschaft. In 1951 he received an honorary doctorate from Heidelberg. After his retirement in 1957 he moved to Tutzing and up until his death held seminars on Greek law at the University of Munich.

==Scholarly Work==
 
His major work is ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' (Munich, 1960), which was intended to replace the work of [[Georg Wissowa]] that by then was nearly 60 years old. Although widely cited, Latte's work has not escaped criticism. Latte attempted to be systematic and historical at the same time, melding Wissowa's [[Varro]]-based systematic description with the historical approach of [[Franz Altheim]]; the resulting structure can seem haphazard.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of [[Stefan Weinstock]], Latte's understanding of [[linguistics]] was superior to that of Wissowa.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by C. Robert Phillips III, "Approaching Roman Religion: The Case for ''Wissenschaftsgeschichte''," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 25. Weinstock's essay review of Latte's book appeared in the ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 51 (1961) 206–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latte rejected [[animism]] as having explanatory value for the study of Roman religion, but made some use of the concept of [[sympathetic magic]], an approach criticized as inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, "Approaching Roman Religion," pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; His discussion of [[Priesthoods of ancient Rome|Roman priesthoods]]&lt;!--this article exists as a draft on a user page--&gt; is considered "vital."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Smith, "The Religion of Archaic Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latte viewed Roman religious traditions as in decline in the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC - 30)|late Republic]], and subject to political abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne William Rasmussen, ''Public Portents in Republican Rome'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2003), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He felt, however, that the importance of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] had been exaggerated, and that "emperor worship" was a minor and perhaps not really a religious phenomenon at all. His is a counterweight to the predominant scholarly view that Imperial cult became increasingly central to Roman religion.&lt;ref&gt;As summarized by Allen Brent, ''The Imperial Cult and the Development of Church Order: Concepts and Images of Authority in Paganism and Early Christianity before the Age of Cyprian'' (Brill, 1999), pp. xix–xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latte's monumental edition of [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] was left unfinished at the time of his death (vol. 1 published in 1953, vol. 2 posthumously in 1966); the work was completed by [[Peter Allan Hansen]] and Ian C. Cunningham (vols. 3-4, 2005-2009).

'''''The Latin Mass: A Journal of Catholic Culture''''', commonly referred to as '''''Latin Mass Magazine''''', is an American [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] [[magazine]] published quarterly, with a [[traditionalist Catholic]] viewpoint.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} It is based in [[Ramsey, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Contact us|url=http://www.latinmassmagazine.com/contact/contact_main.html|accessdate=July 20, 2016|work=Latin Mass Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published by the Catholic organization Keep the Faith, ''Latin Mass Magazine'' is a strong supporter of the traditional [[Tridentine Mass]] and has often expressed skepticism about the [[liturgy|liturgical]] and other reforms introduced by the [[Second Vatican Council]] and Popes [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] and [[Paul VI]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The magazine admires Pope [[Benedict XVI]] because of his emphasis on traditional Catholic dogma and apparent desire to widen the use of the Tridentine Mass in the church.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The magazine claims to be "one of the fastest growing Catholic periodicals in the country.".&lt;ref name=LMMabout&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinmassmagazine.com/about/about_main.html|title=''Latin Mass Magazine'' website|accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Wanderer (newspaper)|The Wanderer]]'', a Catholic weekly newspaper, former publisher Roger McCaffrey claimed: "In 10 years, the circulation of ''Latin Mass Magazine'' will be higher than that of ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/mershon/061013|title=RenewAmerica.us|accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its mission statement, the magazine attempts to combat what it sees as "accelerating secularism" by emphasizing a "return of the Church to tradition and authentic organic development". The magazine also holds conferences to encourage conservative priests and laity in furthering a more traditional approach to Catholic teaching and liturgy, and it hopes to establish a study center "that will assist the articulation of Catholic tradition".&lt;ref name=LMMabout /&gt; 

The magazine's most recent managing editor was  John W. Blewett, who died February 8, 2013.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The publication has seen occasional controversy, such as its dispute with ''The Wanderer'' over ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'', Paul VI's [[encyclical]] on [[birth control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlecatholic.com/article_20020531_Wanderer_Attacks_Latin_Mass.html|title=''Seattle Catholic'' website|accessdate=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lavabo''' is a device used to provide water for the washing of hands. It consists normally of an [[ewer]] or container of some kind to pour water, and a bowl to catch the water as it falls off the hands. In ecclesiastical usage it refers to all of: the basin in which the priest washes his/her/their hands; the ritual that surrounds this action in the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]; and the architectural feature or fitting where a basin or place for one is recessed into the side wall of the sanctuary, or projects from it. If this last includes or included a drain, it is a [[piscina]] used for washing the church plate and other fittings, though the terms are often confused.  In secular usage, it is an obsolete term for any sink or basin for washing hands, especially in a [[toilet (room)|lavatory]].

==Ecclesiastical usage==
[[Image:8555 - Milano - San Marco - Lavabo nel transetto dx - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 14-Apr-2007.jpg|thumb|left|Mediaeval lavabo in the right-hand [[transept]] of [[San Marco, Milan|Saint Mark's Church]] in [[Milan]].]]

The name ''{{lang|la|lavabo}}'' ("I shall wash" in Latin) is derived from the words of [[Psalm]] {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|26:6-12|HE}} ([[KJV]]; in the [[Septuagint]] it is Psalm 25), which the [[Officiant|celebrant]] traditionally recites while he/she/they washes his/her/their hands: "I will wash my hands in innocency, so will I compass thine altar, O Lord". The washing of hands during the recitation of these psalm verses is of very ancient usage in the [[Catholic Church]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the third century there are traces of a custom of washing the hands as a preparation for prayer on the part of all Christians; and from the fourth century onwards it appears to have been usual for the ministers at the [[Communion rite|Communion Service]] ceremonially to wash their hands before the more solemn part of the service as a symbol of inward purity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/pc/pwra/rced4/section3.html ''Report of the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline'']  ([[Church of England]]) 1906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In most liturgical traditions, the priest washes his/her/their hands after [[vestments|vesting]], before the beginning of the liturgy. This washing may be accompanied by prayers. Many [[Christian sacraments|Christian rites]] also have the priest wash his/her/their hands before beginning the [[Eucharistic prayer]]. In the ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', VIII, 11, the hands of the celebrants are washed just before the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of the [[catechumens]].

===Western Rite===
[[Image:Lavabo, Abbaye du Thoronet.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Lavabo, [[Le Thoronet Abbey]], Le Thoronet, France]]
In the [[Roman Rite]], the celebrant washes his hands before vesting for [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], but with another prayer (''[[Vesting Prayers|Da, Domine, virtutem]]''). This is said privately in the [[vestry]]. He will then wash his hands again after the [[offertory]]—this is the ceremony that is known as the ''lavabo'' proper. This washing appears in both the [[Tridentine Mass]], the 1962 edition of which is now an authorized [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]]), and in the [[Mass of Paul VI]]. The reason for this "second" washing of hands probably developed from the long ceremony of receiving the loaves and vessels of wine from the people at the offertory that was used at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Duchesne|Duchesne, Louis]], ''Origines du Culte chretien'' (Paris, 1898), 167, 443.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gallican Rite]] the offerings were prepared before Mass began, as in the Eastern [[Liturgy of Preparation]], so there was no long version of the offertory nor place for a lavabo before the Eucharistic Prayer. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Roman Rite actually had two washing of hands, one before and one after the offertory. This first one has since disappeared, and the one which remains is the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

At [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]] (or sung Mass), in the older rite, and in the more solemn forms available in the newer version, after the offertory, the celebrant censes the altar and is then censed himself at the [[Epistle side]] (south side of the altar), he remains there while his hands are washed by the [[acolyte]]s, who ought to be waiting by the [[credence table]]. The first acolyte pours water from the [[cruet]] over his fingers into a little dish, the second then hands him the towel to dry the fingers. Meanwhile, in the 1962 rubrics he says the psalm verses: "I will wash my hands among the innocent...", to the end of the psalm (Psalm 25: 6-12 in the Vulgate, which is Psalm 26: 6-12 in the Hebrew). In the newer Mass the celebrant says the prayer: "Lord, wash away my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin" (Psalm 50:2, Psalm 51:2 in the Hebrew).

A [[bishop]] at high Mass wears the "precious" [[mitre]] (''mitra pretiosa'') while he is censed and then washes his hands. A larger silver basin and cruet are generally used for a bishop, though there is no official requirement for this. 

For the lavabo, the priest will use a simple [[linen]] [[towel]], which is often considered to be one of the [[altar linen]]s, though technically it is not.

===Eastern Rites===
[[File:Патриарх всея Руси в Архангельске.JPG|thumb|Patriarch [[Kirill I of Moscow]] washing his hands at the [[Great Entrance]] during an outdoor [[Divine Liturgy]].]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches, the priest says the last six verses from Psalm 26:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I will wash my hands in innocency and I will compass Thine altar, O Lord, that I may hear the voice of Thy praise and tell of all Thy wondrous works. O Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth. Destroy not my soul with the ungodly, nor my life with men of blood, in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is full of bribes. But as for me, in mine innocence have I walked; redeem me, O Lord, and have mercy on me. My foot hath stood in uprightness; in the congregations will I bless Thee, O Lord.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After vesting, he goes to the ''[[thalassidion]]'' (piscina) to wash his hands before approaching the [[prothesis (altar)|prothesis]] ([[altar]] of preparation), where he will prepare the bread and wine for the [[Divine Liturgy]].  This lavabo takes place quietly, outside of the view of the congregation.

Saint [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] mentions a washing of hands that takes place in the sight of the people ([[Mystagogue|Mystagogical]] [[Catechism]], v). And this still takes place at a [[Hierarch]]ical Divine Liturgy (i.e., one at which a bishop is serving). He will wash his hands as he stands at the ''[[kathedra]]'' in the [[nave]] of the church.  This takes place during the reading of the [[Little Hours]] after he has been solemly vested by two [[subdeacon]]s. The subdeacons and a server will approach the bishop; the server holds the [[ewer]] and [[Sink|basin]], and has a large towel around his neck.  The subedacons pour [[rose water]] over the bishop's hands and then lift the towel from the server's neck and give it to the bishop for him to dry his hands. Meanwhile, the [[protodeacon]] is swinging the [[censer]] and chanting the verses from Psalm 25. Afterwards, the subdeacons replace the towel over the server's neck, and all three bow to the bishop and return to the sanctuary. 

[[File:Brass objects (18th century, Russia, GIM) 02 by shakko.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century brass lavabo used in the Russian army.]]

Just before the [[Great Entrance]] the same ceremony takes place as during the Little Hours, except now it takes place in front of the [[Holy Doors]] of the [[iconostasis]]. After drying his hands, the bishop goes to the prothesis to make his personal commemorations for the living and the dead, as he removes particles from the [[prosphora]].

The clergy will also wash their hands after receiving Holy Communion, but this is not accompanied by special prayers.

In the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic]] rites, the lavabo takes place after the recitation of the [[Nicene Creed]].

===Monastic practice===
In many early and medieveal [[monasteries]], there would be a large lavabo (''lavatorio'') where the brethren would wash their hands before entering church. This practice was first legislated in the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] in the 6th century, but has earlier antecedents. St. [[John Chrysostom]] mentions the custom in his day of all Christians washing their hands before entering the church for worship.

==Secular usage==
[[Image:Lavabo-19e-p1030512.jpg|thumb|A 19th-century lavabo.]]
Though ecclesiastical lavabos are ordinarily of metal, a familiar lavabo consists of a [[terra cotta]] tank with a faucet attached and a small basin below it.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Today it is a common feature in many gardens in Europe and the U.S. as a decoration whose practical use has been long forgotten. 

The lavabo may be considered the forerunner of the modern [[sink]]. In several European languages (French, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Turkish), ''lavabo'' is the modern word for  sink or washbasin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">The '''(Roman) Catholic Church in [[Senegal]]''' is composed solely of a Latin hierarchy, &lt;br&gt;comprising a single [[ecclesiastical province]], coinciding with the country, &lt;br&gt;consisting of the Metropolitan see (in the capital Dakar) and six suffragan dioceses. 

There is no national [[Episcopal Conference]] of Senegal but capital Dakar hosts and its episcopate partakes in the transnational Romance languages [[West Africa]]n  ''Conférence des Evêques du Sénégal, de la Mauritanie, du Cap-Vert et de Guinée-Bissau'', jointly with two francophone neighbours (fellow ex-French colonies) [[Mauritania]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]] and with lusophone (ex-Portuguese) [[Cape Verde]]. &lt;br&gt;The Anglophone Gambia (an enclave in Senegal) however forms a conference with (also ex-British) Sierra Leone.

There are no Eastern Catholic, pre-diocesan or other exempt jurisdictions.

There are no titular sees. All defunct jurisdictions are predecessors of current sees.

There is an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to Senegal (in national capital [[Dakar]]) as embassy-level papal diplomatic representation. In it are also vested to Apostolic Nunciatures to episcopal conference-partners Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau as well as the [[Apostolic Delegation]] (lower level) the last partner Mauritania.

Gethin seems to echo Vetter (1988), ''The Ideas and Meditative Practices of Early Buddhism'', who notes that the ''[[:Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' describes the Buddha as instructing his first followers in turn: instructing two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food, signifying the need of personal instruction to learn ho to practice ''dhyana''.}} One method is to sit on a straight-backed chair or sit cross-legged on the floor or a cushion, close one’s eyes and bring attention to either the sensations of breathing in the proximity of one’s nostrils or to the movements of the abdomen when breathing in and out.&lt;ref group=web name=AskDrK&gt;{{cite web |last=Komaroff |first=Anthony |title=Does "mindfulness meditation" really help relieve stress and anxiety? |url= http://www.askdoctork.com/mindfulness-meditation-really-help-relieve-stress-anxiety-201403316226 |work=Ask Doctor K |publisher= Harvard Health Publications |accessdate=22 April 2014 |date= March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wilson|2014}}&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt; In this meditation practice, one does not try to control one’s breathing, but attempts to simply be aware of one’s natural breathing process/rhythm.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt; When engaged in this practice, the mind will often run off to other thoughts and associations, and if this happens, one passively notices that the mind has wandered, and in an accepting, non-judgmental way, returns to focusing on breathing.

Other meditation exercises to develop mindfulness include body-scan meditation where attention is directed at various areas of the body and noting body sensations that happen in the present moment.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt;  Engaging in yoga practices, while attending to movements and body sensations, as well as walking meditation are other methods of developing mindfulness.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt;  One could also focus on sounds, sensations, thoughts, feelings and actions that happen in the present.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mindfulness in plain English"/&gt; In this regard, a famous exercise, introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his [[#Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR|MBSR]] program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/mindfulness-based-programs/mbsr-courses/about-mbsr/history-of-mbsr/]&lt;/ref&gt; is the mindful tasting of a raisin,{{sfn|Ihnen|Flynn|2008|p=148}} in which a raisin is being tasted and eaten mindfully.{{sfn|Teasdale|Segal|2007|pp=55–56}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://hfhc.ext.wvu.edu/r/download/114469 ''Eating One Raisin: A First Taste of Mindfulness''] for a hand-out file}}

Meditators are recommended to start with short periods of 10 minutes or so of meditation practice per day. As one practices regularly, it becomes easier to keep the attention focused on breathing.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time2014"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24640415 |year=2014 |author1= Pickert |first1=K |title=The art of being mindful.

Mindfulness meditation is part of Buddhist psychological traditions and the developing scholarship within empirical psychology.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE Open |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=215824401558386 |year=2015 |last1= Karunamuni |first1=N.D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown et al 2007"/&gt;

===Sati and smṛti===
{{Main|Sati (Buddhism)}}

The Buddhist term translated into English as "mindfulness" originates in the Pali term ''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]'' and in its Sanskrit counterpart [[smriti|''smṛti'']]. It is often translated as "bare attention," but in the Buddhist tradition it has a broader meaning and application, and the meaning of these terms has been the topic of extensive debate and discussion.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}}

According to Bryan Levman writing in the ''Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies'', "the word ''sati'' incorporates the meaning of 'memory' and 'remembrance' in much of its usage in both the ''suttas'' and the [traditional Buddhist] commentary, and... without the memory component, the notion of mindfulness cannot be properly understood or applied, as mindfulness requires memory for its effectiveness".&lt;ref name=levman17&gt;[http://www.jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/view/167 Bryan Levman (2017)], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Robert Sharf, ''smṛti'' originally meant "to remember," "to recollect," "to bear in mind," as in the Vedic tradition of remembering the sacred texts. The term ''sati'' also means "to remember." In the ''Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta'' the term ''sati'' means to remember the [[dharma]]s, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}} Sharf refers to the [[Milindapañha]], which explained that the arisement of ''sati'' calls to mind the wholesome [[dhamma]]s such as the four establishings of mindfulness, the five faculties, the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā#Five powers|five powers]], the seven awakening-factors, the noble eight-factored path, and the attainment of insight.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|pp=942–43}} According to Rupert Gethin, 
{{quote|[''sati''] should be understood as what allows awareness of the full range and extent of ''dhammas''; ''sati'' is an awareness of things in relation to things, and hence an awareness of their relative value. Applied to the ''satipaṭṭhānas'', presumably what this means is that ''sati'' is what causes the practitioner of yoga to "remember" that any feeling he may experience exists in relation to a whole variety or world of feelings that may be skillful or unskillful, with faults or faultless, relatively inferior or refined, dark or pure."{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=943}}{{refn|group=note|Quotes from Gethin, Rupert M.L. (1992), ''The Buddhist Path to Awakening: A Study of the Bodhi-Pakkhiȳa Dhammā''. Brill's Indological Library, 7. Leiden and New York: Brill}}}}

Sharf further notes that this has little to do with "bare attention," the popular contemporary interpretation of ''sati'', "since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise."{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=943}}

[[Georges Dreyfus]] has also expressed unease with the definition of mindfulness as "bare attention" or "nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness", stressing that mindfulness in Buddhist context means also "remembering", which indicates that the function of mindfulness also includes the retention of information.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Dreyfus concludes his examination by stating: "[T]he identification of mindfulness with bare attention ignores or, at least, underestimates the cognitive implications of mindfulness, its ability to bring together various aspects of experience so as to lead to the clear comprehension of the nature of mental and bodily states. By over-emphasizing the nonjudgmental nature of mindfulness and arguing that our problems stem from conceptuality, contemporary authors are in danger of leading to a one-sided understanding of mindfulness as a form of therapeutically helpful spacious quietness. I think that it is important not to lose sight that mindfulness is not just a therapeutic technique but is a natural capacity that plays a central role in the cognitive process. It is this aspect that seems to be ignored when mindfulness is reduced to a form of nonjudgmental present-centered form of awareness of one’s experiences.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus"&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Mindfulness_Present-Centered_Nonjudgmental-Attention_Introspection-A-Discussion_Dreyfus.html "Is Mindfulness Present-Centered and Nonjudgmental? A Discussion of the Cognitive Dimensions of Mindfulness"] by Georges Dreyfus&lt;/ref&gt;}} Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of "correct view", not just "bare attention".&lt;ref group=web name="Sharf" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Sharf: "[[Mahasi Sayadaw|Mahasi]]’s technique did not require familiarity with Buddhist doctrine (notably abhidhamma), did not require adherence to strict ethical norms (notably monasticism), and promised astonishingly quick results. This was made possible through interpreting sati as a state of "bare awareness" – the unmediated, non-judgmental perception of things "as they are," uninflected by prior psychological, social, or cultural conditioning. This notion of mindfulness is at variance with premodern Buddhist epistemologies in several respects. Traditional Buddhist practices are oriented more toward acquiring "correct view" and proper ethical discernment, rather than "no view" and a non-judgmental attitude."&lt;ref group=web name="Sharf"&gt;[http://blogs.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/tag/geoffrey-samuel/ Robert H. Sharf, ''Mindfulness or Mindlessness: Traditional and Modern Buddhist Critiques of "Bare Awareness"'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Jay Garfield]], quoting [[Shantideva]] and other sources, stresses that mindfulness is constituted by the union of two functions, ''calling to mind'' and vigilantly ''retaining in mind''. He demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the practice of mindfulness and the cultivation of morality – at least in the context of Buddhism from which modern interpretations of mindfulness are stemming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Mindfulness-and-Morality-J-Garfield.html "Mindfulness and Ethics: Attention, Virtue and Perfection"] by Jay Garfield&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
The Pali-language scholar [[Thomas William Rhys Davids]] (1843–1922) first translated ''sati'' in 1881 as English ''[[Wikt:mindfulness|mindfulness]]'' in ''sammā-sati'' "Right Mindfulness; the active, watchful mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=T.W. Rhys |last1=Davids |year=1881 |title=Buddhist Suttas |publisher=Clarendon Press |oclc=13247398 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that Daniel John Gogerly (1845) initially rendered ''sammā-sati'' as "Correct meditation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gogerly |first1=D.J. |year=1845 |title=On Buddhism |journal=Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=1 |pages=7–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davids explained: 
{{quote|''sati'' is literally 'memory' but is used with reference to the constantly repeated phrase 'mindful and thoughtful' (''sato sampajâno''); and means that activity of mind and constant presence of mind which is one of the duties most frequently inculcated on the good Buddhist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=T.W. Rhys |last1=Davids |year=1881 |title=Buddhist Suttas |publisher=Clarendon Press |oclc= 13247398 |page=145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Alternative translations===
[[John D. Dunne]] asserts that the translation of ''sati'' and  ''smṛti'' as mindfulness is confusing. A number of Buddhist scholars have started trying to establish "retention" as the preferred alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Lecture, Stanford University Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education |url= http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |publisher=The Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171057/http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |archivedate= 2012-11-20 |date=2011 |deadurl= yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bhikkhu Bodhi also points to the meaning of "sati" as "memory".&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquiringmind.com/Articles/Translator.html |title=Translator for the Buddha: An Interview with Bhikkhu Bodhi |website=www.inquiringmind.com |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"The word derives from a verb, sarati, meaning “to remember,” and occasionally in Pali sati is still explained in a way that connects it with the idea of memory. But when it is used in relation to meditation practice, we have no word in English that precisely captures what it refers to.

==Definitions==

===Psychology===
A.M. Haynes and G. Feldman have highlighted that mindfulness can be seen as a strategy that stands in contrast to a strategy of avoidance of emotion on the one hand and to the strategy of emotional overengagement on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/clipsy/bph080 |title=Clarifying the Construct of Mindfulness in the Context of Emotion Regulation and the Process of Change in Therapy |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=255–62 |year=2004 |last1=Hayes |first1=A.M |citeseerx= 10.1.1.168.5070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness can also be viewed as a means to develop self-knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

====Trait, state and practice====
According to Brown, Ryan, and Creswell, definitions of mindfulness are typically selectively interpreted based on who is studying it and how it is applied. Some have viewed mindfulness as a mental state, while others have viewed it as a set of skills and techniques.&lt;ref name="Brown et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10478400701598298 |title=Mindfulness: Theoretical Foundations and Evidence for its Salutary Effects |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=211–37 |year=2007 |last1=Brown |first1=Kirk Warren |last2=Ryan |first2= Richard M |last3=Creswell |first3=J. David }}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction can also be made between the ''state'' of mindfulness and the ''trait'' of mindfulness.{{sfn|Gehart|2012|pp=7–8}}

According to David S. Black, whereas "mindfulness" originally was associated with esoteric beliefs and religion, and "a capacity attainable only by certain people",{{sfn|Black|2011|p=1}} scientific researchers have translated the term into measurable terms, providing a valid operational definition of mindfulness.{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}}{{refn|group=note|Black: "[S]everal decades of research methodology and scientific discovery have defrayed these myths; mindfulness is now widely considered to be an inherent quality of human consciousness. That is, a capacity of attention and awareness oriented to the present moment that varies in degree within and between individuals, and can be assessed empirically and independent of religious, spiritual, or cultural beliefs.{{sfn|Black|2011|p=1}}}} Black mentions three possible domains:{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}}
# A trait, a dispositional characteristic (a relatively long lasting trait),{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}} a person's tendency to more frequently enter into and more easily abide in mindful states;{{sfn|Gehart|2012|p=7}}
# A state, an outcome (a state of awareness resulting from mindfulness training),{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}} being in a state of present-moment awareness;{{sfn|Gehart|2012|p=7}}
# A practice (mindfulness meditation practice itself).{{refn|group=note|"Mindfulness meditation" may refer to either the secular, western practice of mindfulness,{{sfn|Zgierska|2009}} or to modern Buddhist [[Vipassana|Vipassana-meditation]].{{sfn|Didonna|2008|p=27}}{{sfn|Kristeller|2007|p=393}}{{sfn|Germer|2005|p=15}}}}

=====Trait-like constructs=====
According to Brown, mindfulness is:
{{quote|A quality of consciousness manifest in, but not isomorphic with, the activities through which it is enhanced."&lt;ref name="Brown et al 2007"/&gt;}}

Several mindfulness measures have been developed which are based on self-reporting of trait-like constructs:{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=10}}
* [https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/resources/questionnaires-researchers/mindful-attention-awareness-scale Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)]
* Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI)
* Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS)
* Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS)
* Mindfulness Questionnaire (MQ)
* Revised Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS-R)
* Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS)

=====State-like phenomenon=====
According to Bishop, et alia, mindfulness is, "A kind of nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness in which each thought, feeling, or sensation that arises in the attentional field is acknowledged and accepted as it is."&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004"/&gt;

* The Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) measures mindfulness as a state-like phenomenon, that is evoked and maintained by regular practice.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=10}}
* The State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) is a 21-item survey with an overall state mindfulness scale, and 2 sub-scales (state mindfulness of mind, and state mindfulness of body).&lt;ref name="Tanay"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1037/a0034044 |pmid=24059475 |title= State Mindfulness Scale (SMS): Development and initial validation |journal= Psychological Assessment |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=1286–99 |year=2013 |last1=Tanay |first1=Galia |last2= Bernstein |first2=Amit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mindfulness-practice====
Mindfulness as a practice is described as:
* "Mindfulness is a way of paying attention that originated in Eastern meditation practices"&lt;ref&gt;Marlatt &amp; Kristeller, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally"&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt;
* "Bringing one’s complete attention to the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis"&lt;ref name="Baer defines2" /&gt;

According to Steven F. Hick, mindfulness practice involves both formal and informal meditation practices, and nonmeditation-based exercises.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}} Formal mindfulness, or meditation, is the practice of sustaining attention on body, breath or sensations, or whatever arises in each moment.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}} Informal mindfulness is the application of mindful attention in everyday life.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}} Nonmeditation-based exercises are specifically used in dialectical behavior therapy and in [[acceptance and commitment therapy]]. {{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}}

====Two-component model====
In a paper that described a consensus among [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]] on an operational and testable definition, Bishop, Lau, et al. (2004)&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/clipsy.bph077 |title=Mindfulness: A Proposed Operational Definition |journal= Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=230–41 |year=2006 |last1=Bishop |first1=Scott R. |last2=Lau |first2=Mark |last3=Shapiro |first3=Shauna |last4=Carlson |first4=Linda |last5= Anderson |first5=Nicole D. |last6=Carmody |first6=James |last7=Segal |first7=Zindel V. |last8=Abbey |first8=Susan |last9=Speca |first9=Michael |last10=Velting |first10=Drew |last11=Devins |first11=Gerald |citeseerx= 10.1.1.168.6212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a two-component model of mindfulness: 
{{quote|The first component involves the self-regulation of attention so that it is maintained on immediate experience, thereby allowing for increased recognition of mental events in the present moment. The second component involves adopting a particular orientation toward one’s experiences in the present moment, an orientation that is characterized by curiosity, openness, and acceptance.&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004" /&gt;{{rp|232}}}}

In this two-component model, self-regulated attention (the first component) "involves bringing [[awareness]] to current experience - observing and attending to the changing fields of "objects" (thoughts, feelings, sensations), from moment to moment – by regulating the focus of attention". Orientation to experience (the second component) involves maintaining an attitude of curiosity about objects experienced at each moment, and about where and how the mind wanders when it drifts from the selected focus of attention. Clients are asked to avoid trying to produce a particular state (e.g. relaxation), but rather to just notice each object that arises in the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004" /&gt;{{rp|233}}

====The five-aggregate model====
An ancient model of the mind, generally known as the five-aggregate model&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; enables one to understand the moment-to-moment manifestation of subjective conscious experience, and therefore can be a potentially useful theoretical resource to guide mindfulness interventions.

The five aggregates are described as follows:
# ''Material form:'' includes both the physical body and external matter where material elements are continuously moving to and from the material body.
# ''Feelings:'' can be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.
# ''Perceptions:'' represent being aware of attributes of an object (e.g. color, shape, etc.)
# ''Volition:'' represents bodily, verbal, or psychological behavior.
# ''Sensory consciousness:'' refers to input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations) or a thought that happen to arise in the mind.

This model describes how sensory consciousness results in the generation of feelings, perception or volition, and how individuals’ previously conditioned attitudes and past associations influence this generation. The five aggregates are described as constantly arising and ceasing in the present moment.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

====Cultivating self-knowledge and wisdom====
The practice of mindfulness can be utilized to gradually develop self-knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; In this regard, Buddhist teachings provide detailed instructions on how one can carry out an inquiry into the nature of the mind, and this guidance can help one to make sense of one’s subjective experience. This could include understanding what the “present moment” is, how various thoughts, etc., arise following input from the senses, the conditioned nature of thoughts, and other realizations.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; In Buddhist teachings, ultimate wisdom refers to gaining deep insight into all phenomena or “seeing things as they are.”&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

===Definitions arising in modern teaching of meditation===
Since the 1970s, most books on meditation use definitions of mindfulness similar to [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]'s definition as "present moment awareness".  However, recently a number of teachers of meditation have proposed quite different definitions of mindfulness.  [[Shinzen Young]] says a person is mindful when they have mindful awareness, and defines that to be when "concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity [are] working together."&lt;ref&gt;From 'See, Hear, Feel: An Introduction', draft 1.8., https://www.shinzen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SeeHearFeelIntroduction_ver1.8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Yates (Culadasa)]] defines mindfulness to be "the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness", where he distinguishes attention and peripheral awareness as two distinct modes in which one may be conscious of things.&lt;ref&gt;p. 30, ''The Mind Illuminated'', Culadasa with Immergut and Graves, Hay House, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other usages===
The English term ''mindfulness'' already existed before it came to be used in a (western) Buddhist context. It was first recorded as ''myndfulness'' in 1530 ([[John Palsgrave]] translates French ''[[:wikt:pensée|pensée]]''), as ''mindfulnesse'' in 1561, and ''mindfulness'' in 1817. [[Morphology (linguistics) |Morphologically]] earlier terms include ''mindful'' (first recorded in 1340), ''mindfully'' (1382), and the obsolete ''mindiness'' (c. 1200).&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, mindfulness may also refer to "a state of being aware".&lt;ref group=web name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/mindfulness|title=Thesaurus results for 'Mindfulness' |website= www.merriam-webster.com |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms for this "state of being aware" are [[Wakefulness#Mindfulness |wakefulness]],{{sfn|Kabat-Zin|2011|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|Kabat-Zin|2013|p=65}} [[attention]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dico.isc.cnrs.fr/dico/en/search?b=1&amp;r=mindfulness&amp;send=Look+it+up|title=Component Selection for 'mindfulness' |website= dico.isc.cnrs.fr |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; alertness,&lt;ref group=web name="TC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thesaurus.com/browse/mindfulness|title=I found great synonyms for "mindfulness" on the new Thesaurus.com! |website= www.thesaurus.com |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; prudence,&lt;ref group=web name="TC" /&gt; conscientiousness,&lt;ref group=web name="TC" /&gt; awareness,&lt;ref group=web name="MW" /&gt; consciousness,&lt;ref group=web name="MW" /&gt; and observation.&lt;ref group=web name="MW" /&gt;

====Early Buddhism====
''Sati'' is one of the [[bojjhanga|seven factors of enlightenment]]. "Correct" or "right" mindfulness (Pali: ''sammā-sati'', Sanskrit ''samyak-smṛti'') is the seventh element of the [[noble eightfold path]]. Mindfulness is an antidote to delusion and is considered as a 'power' (Pali: ''[[Five Strengths|bala]]'') which contributes to the attainment of ''[[nirvana]]''. This faculty becomes a power in particular when it is coupled with [[sampajañña|clear comprehension]] of whatever is taking place. Nirvana is a state of being in which greed, hatred and [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]] (Pali: ''moha'') have been overcome and abandoned, and are absent from the mind.

According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way in early Buddhism to liberation, "constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths."{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=46}}{{refn|group=note|name="Frauwallner"|Frauwallner, E. (1973), ''History of Indian Philosophy'', trans. V.M. Bedekar, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. Two volumes., pp.150 ff}} According to Vetter, ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' may have been the [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Contents and teachings of earliest Buddhism|original core practice of the Buddha]], which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

According to Rhys Davids, the doctrine of mindfulness is "perhaps the most important" after the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. T.W. Rhys Davids viewed the teachings of Gotama as a rational technique for self-actualization and rejected a few parts of it, mainly the doctrine of rebirth, as residual superstitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rhys Davids |first1=T.W. |title= Dialogues of the Buddha, Part II |date=1959 |orig-year=1910 |publisher=Pali Text Society |location= Oxford, Great Britain |isbn=0 86013 034 7 |pages= 322–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zazen====
{{Main|Zazen|Shikantaza}}

The aim of [[zazen]] is just [[sitting]], that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.&lt;ref name="hcz2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Warner|title=[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies, &amp; the Truth about Reality]]|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|pages=189–190|year=2003|isbn= 086171380X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Shunryū|authorlink=Shunryū Suzuki|title=[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]|pages=15–16|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|year=2011|ISBN=978-159030849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary ''vipassana''-meditation====
In modern ''vipassana''-meditation, as propgated by the [[Vipassana movement]], ''sati'' aids ''vipassana'', [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] into the true nature of reality, namely the [[three marks of existence]], the [[impermanence]] of and the [[dukkha|unsatisfactoriness]] of every conditioned thing that exists, and [[anatta|non-self]].&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Analayo_2003"/&gt; With this insight, the practitioner becomes a socalled ''[[Sotāpanna]]'', a "stream-enterer", the first stage on the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|path to liberation]].&lt;ref name="Sister Ayya Khema"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khema/allofus.html |title=All of Us |accessdate= 2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight |last= Sister Ayya Khema}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html |title= The Noble Eightfold Path |accessdate= 2009-03-16 |publisher= Access to Insight |last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|In [[Mahayana]] contexts, it entails insight into what is variously described as [[sunyata]], [[dharmata]], the inseparability of appearance and emptiness ([[two truths doctrine]]), clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Defined by Reginald A.

Vipassana is practiced in tandem with [[samatha]], and also plays a central role in other Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name="Analayo_2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anālayo |first1=Bhikku |title= Satipaṭṭhāna, the direct path to realization |date=2003 |publisher= Windhorse Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Theravada Buddhism?|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/theravada.html|work=Access to Insight |publisher= Access to Insight |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the contemporary Theravada orthodoxy, samatha is used as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism |liberation]].

Vipassanā-meditation has gained popularity in the west through the modern Buddhist vipassana movement, modeled after Theravāda Buddhism meditation practices,{{sfn|McMahan}} which employs vipassanā and [[anapana|ānāpāna]] meditation as its primary techniques and places emphasis on the teachings of the {{IAST|Satipaṭṭhāna}} Sutta.

=====Anapanasati, satipaṭṭhāna, and vipassana=====
[[Anapanasati]] is mindfulness of breathing. "Sati" means [[Mindfulness (Buddhism) |mindfulness]]; "ānāpāna" refers to inhalation and exhalation. Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body. The ''Anapanasati Sutta'' gives an exposition on this practice.{{refn|group=note|[[Majjhima Nikaya]] (MN), sutta number 118. See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html Thanissaro, 2006]. Other discourses which describe the full four tetrads can be found in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]'s ''Anapana-samyutta'' (Ch. 54), such as SN 54.6 (Thanissaro, 2006a), SN 54.8 (Thanissaro, 2006b) and SN 54.13 (Thanissaro, 1995a). The one-tetrad exposition of anapanasati is found, for instance, in the ''Kayagata-sati Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 119; Thanissaro, 1997), the ''Maha-satipatthana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 22; Thanissaro, 2000) and the ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' (MN 10; Thanissaro, 1995b).}}

[[Satipaṭṭhāna]] is the establishment of mindfulness in one's day-to-day life, maintaining as much as possible a calm awareness of one's body, feelings, mind, and [[dharma]]s. The practice of mindfulness supports analysis resulting in the arising of wisdom (Pali: ''paññā'', Sanskrit: ''prajñā'').&lt;ref name="Analayo_2003"/&gt;

=====''Samprajaña'', ''apramāda'' and ''atappa''=====
In contemporary Theravada practice, "mindfulness" also includes ''samprajaña'', meaning "clear comprehension" and ''apramāda'' meaning "vigilance".&lt;ref name="Subhuti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madhyamavani.fwbo.org/8/mindfulness.html |title=Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO): Buddhism and Mindfulness |first= |last=Satyadarshin |website= madhyamavani.fwbo.org |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[I]n Buddhist discourse, there are three terms that together map the field of mindfulness [...] [in their Sanskrit variants] ''smṛti'' (Pali: ''sati''), ''samprajaña'' (Pali: ''[[Sampajañña]]'')  and ''[[apramāda]]'' (Pali: ''appamada'').&lt;ref name="Subhuti" /&gt;}} All three terms are sometimes (confusingly) translated as "mindfulness", but they all have specific shades of meaning.

In a publicly available correspondence between [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] and [[B. Alan Wallace]], Bodhi has described Ven. [[Nyanaponika Thera]]'s views on "right mindfulness" and sampajañña as follows:
{{quote|He held that in the proper practice of right mindfulness, sati has to be integrated with sampajañña, clear comprehension, and it is only when these two work together that right mindfulness can fulfill its intended purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://shamatha.org/sites/default/files/Bhikkhu_Bodhi_Correspondence.pdf |title="The Nature of Mindfulness and Its Role in Buddhist Meditation" A Correspondence between B.A. wallace and the Venerable Bikkhu Bodhi, Winter 2006, p.4 |publisher= |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note| According to this correspondence, Ven. Nyanaponika spend his last ten years living with and being cared for by Bodhi. Bodhi refers to Nyanaponika as "my closest kalyāṇamitta in my life as a monk."}}}}

====Monitoring mental processes====
According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact.{{sfn|Buddhadasa Bhikkhu|2014|p=79, 101, 117 note 42}}

According to Grzegorz Polak, the four ''upassanā'' (foundations of mindfulness) have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four ''upassanā'' do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness:{{sfn|Polak|2011}}
* the [[Ayatana|six sense-bases]] which one needs to be aware of (''kāyānupassanā''); 
* contemplation on [[vedanā]]s, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (''vedanānupassanā'');
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā);
* the development from the [[five hindrances]]  to the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''dhammānupassanā'').}}

===Transcendentalism===
Kabat-Zinn himself refers to Thoreau as a predecessor of the interest in mindfulness, together with the other eminent [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] Emerson and Whitman:{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|year unknown}}
{{quote|The collective experience{{refn|group=note|The resort to "experience" as the ground for religious truths is a strategy which goes back to Schleiermacher, as a defense against the growing influence of western rationality on the religious life of Europeans in the 19th century. See Sharf (1995), ''Buddhist Modernism and the Rhetoric of Meditative Experience''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}}} of sages, yogis, and Zen masters offers a view of the world which is complementary to the predominantly reductionist and materialistic one currently dominating Western thought and institutions. But this view is neither particularly "Eastern" nor mystical. Thoreau saw the same problem with our ordinary mind state in New England in 1846 and wrote with great passion about its unfortunate consequences.{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|year unknown}}}}

The forms of Asian religion and spirituality which were introduced in the west were themselves influenced by Transcendentalism and other 19th-century manifestations of [[Western esotericism]]. Transcendentalism was closely connected to the Unitarian Church,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finseth|first1=Ian Frederick |title= The Emergence of Transcendentalism |url= http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma95/finseth/trans.html |website= virginia.edu |publisher=The University of Virginia |accessdate= 9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in India collaborated with [[Ram Mohan Roy]] (1772–1833) and his [[Brahmo Samaj]].{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} He found that [[Unitarianism]] came closest to true Christianity,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3-8}} This influence worked through on [[Vivekananda]], whose modern but idiosyncratic interpretation of Hinduism became widely popular in the west.{{sfn|King|2001}} Vipassana meditation, presented as a centuries-old meditation system, was a 19th-century reinvention,{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=22}} which gained popularity in south-east due to the accessibility of the Buddhist sutras through English translations from the Pali Text Society.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It was brought to western attention in the 19th century by the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=17}} Zen Buddhism first gained popularity in the west through the writings of [[D.T. Suzuki]], who attempted to present a modern interpretation of Zen, adjusted to western tastes.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

===Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR===
In 1979, [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) program at the [[University of Massachusetts]] to treat the chronically ill.&lt;ref&gt;"The Stress Reduction Program, founded by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979..." - http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This program sparked the application of mindfulness ideas and practices in Medicine&lt;ref&gt;"Much of the interest in the clinical applications of mindfulness has been sparked by the introduction of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a manualized treatment program originally developed for the management of chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, &amp; Burney, 1985; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, Burney, &amp; Sellers, 1987)." - Bishop et al, 2004, "Mindfulness: A Proposed Operational Definition"&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|230–1}} for the treatment of a variety of conditions in both healthy and unhealthy people. MBSR and similar programs are now widely applied in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments.

Mindfulness practices were inspired mainly by teachings from the [[Eastern World]], particularly from Buddhist traditions. Kabat-Zinn himself was first introduced to meditation by [[Philip Kapleau]], a [[Zen]] missionary who came to speak at MIT where Kabat-Zinn was a student. Kabat-Zinn went on to study meditation with other Zen-Buddhist teachers such as [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] and [[Seungsahn]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Wilson |title=Mindful America: The Mutual Transformation of Buddhist Meditation and American Culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at the [[Insight Meditation Society]] and eventually taught there.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;One of MBSR's techniques - the "body scan" - was derived from a meditation practice ("sweeping") of the Burmese [[U Ba Khin]] tradition, as taught by [[S. N. Goenka]] in his [[Vipassana]] retreats, which he began in 1976. It has since been widely adapted in secular settings, independent of religious or cultural contexts.{{refn|group=note|name="jama.ama-assn.org"|"Historically a Buddhist practice, mindfulness can be considered a universal human capacity proposed to foster clear thinking and open-heartedness. As such, this form of meditation requires no particular religious or cultural belief system." - Mindfulness in Medicine by Ludwig and Kabat-Zinn, available at [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/300/11/1350 jama.ama-assn.org]}}{{refn|group=note|"Kabat-Zinn (2000) suggests that mindfulness practice may be beneficial to many people in Western society who might be unwilling to adopt Buddhist traditions or vocabulary. Thus, Western researchers and clinicians who have introduced mindfulness practice into mental health treatment programs usually teach these skills independently of the religious and cultural traditions of their origins (Kabat-Zinn, 1982;Linehan, 1993b)." - Mindfulness Training as a Clinical Intervention: A Conceptual and Empirical Review by Ruth A. Baer}}

===Popularization, "mindfulness movement"===
Mindfulness is gaining a growing popularity as a practice in daily life, apart from Buddhist insight meditation and its application in clinical psychology.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt; In this context mindfulness is defined as moment-by-moment awareness of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, characterized mainly by "acceptance" - attention to thoughts and feelings without judging whether they are right or wrong. Mindfulness focuses the human brain on what is being sensed at each moment, instead of on its normal [[Rumination (psychology) |rumination]] on the past or on the future.&lt;ref name="What Is Mindfulness"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/mindfulness/definition |title= What Is Mindfulness?|website= The Greater Good Science Center |publisher= The Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley |accessdate= 2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mindfulness'' may be seen as a mode of being,&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ira-israel/types-of-mindfulness_b_3347428.html |title= What's the Difference Between Mindfulness, Mindfulness Meditation and Basic Meditation? |website= The Huffington Post |date= 30 May 2013 |last= Israel |first= Ira}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be practiced outside a formal setting.&lt;ref name="Bernhard"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/turning-straw-gold/201106/6-benefits-practicing-mindfulness-outside-meditation |title= 6 Benefits of Practicing Mindfulness Outside of Meditation |date= 6 Jun 2011 |website= Psychology Today |last= Bernhard |first= Toni}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology used by scholars of religion, scientists, journalists, and popular media writers to describe this movement of mindfulness "popularization," and the many new contexts of mindfulness practice which have cropped up, has regularly evolved over the past 20 years, with some criticisms arising.&lt;ref name="Valerio 1–27"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/14639947.2016.1162425 |title= Owning Mindfulness: A Bibliometric Analysis of Mindfulness Literature Trends Within and Outside of Buddhist Contexts |journal= Contemporary Buddhism |volume=17 |pages= 157–83 |year=2016 |last1= Valerio |first1=Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy====
{{Main article|Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy}}

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a [[psychological therapy]] designed to aid in preventing the relapse of depression, specifically in individuals with [[Major depressive disorder]] (MDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.05.002 |pmid= 21802618 |title=The effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for prevention of relapse in recurrent major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal= Clinical Psychology Review |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages= 1032–40 |year=2011 |last1=Piet |first1=Jacob |last2= Hougaard |first2=Esben }}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses traditional [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) methods and adds in newer psychological strategies such as mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. Cognitive methods can include educating the participant about depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.jad.2010.09.027 |pmid=21093925 |title= Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy vs cognitive behaviour therapy as a treatment for non-melancholic depression |journal= Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=130 |issue=1–2 |pages=138–44 |year=2011 |last1= Manicavasgar |first1= Vijaya |last2=Parker |first2=Gordon |last3=Perich |first3=Tania }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness and mindfulness meditation, focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.006 |pmid=20599141 |pmc=2898899 |title=The Empirical Status of the "New Wave" of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy |journal= Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume= 33 |issue=3 |pages=701–10 |year=2010 |last1= Hofmann |first1=Stefan G |last2=Sawyer |first2= Alice T |last3=Fang |first3=Angela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like CBT, MBCT functions on the theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode.&lt;ref name="Felder"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jclp.21832 |pmid=23616298 |title= Collaboration in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=179–86 |year=2012 |last1=Felder |first1=Jennifer N |last2= Dimidjian |first2=Sona |last3=Segal |first3=Zindel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment.&lt;ref name="Felder" /&gt; This mindfulness practice allows the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. 
Research supports the effects of MBCT in people who have been depressed three or more times and demonstrates reduced relapse rates by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1037/0022-006x.72.1.31 |pmid=14756612 |title= Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression: Replication and Exploration of Differential Relapse Prevention Effects |journal= Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=31–40 |year=2004 |last1=Ma |first1=S.

====Acceptance and commitment therapy====
{{Main article|Acceptance and commitment therapy}}

Acceptance and commitment therapy or (ACT) (typically pronounced as the word "act") is a form of [[clinical behavior analysis]] (CBA)&lt;ref name="Plumb"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 22478515 |pmc=2686995 |year=2009 |author1= Plumb |first1=J.

====Dialectical behavior therapy====
Mindfulness is a "core" exercise used in [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), a psychosocial treatment [[Marsha M. Linehan]] developed for treating people with [[borderline personality disorder]]. DBT is [[dialectic]], explains Linehan,&lt;ref&gt;Linehan 1993, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of "the reconciliation of opposites in a continual process of synthesis." As a practitioner of Buddhist meditation techniques, Linehan says:
{{quote|This emphasis in DBT on a balance of acceptance and change owes much to my experiences in studying meditation and Eastern spirituality. The DBT tenets of observing, mindfulness, and avoidance of judgment are all derived from the study and practice of Zen meditations.&lt;ref&gt;Linehan 1993, p.20-21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Mode deactivation therapy====

Since 2006, research supports promising mindfulness-based therapies for a number of medical and psychiatric conditions, notably [[chronic pain]] (McCracken et al. 2007), [[Stress (biological)|stress]] (Grossman et al. 2004), anxiety and depression (Hofmann et al. 2010), [[substance abuse]] (Melemis 2008:141-157), and recurrent [[suicidal behavior]] (Williams et al. 2006). Bell (2009) gives a brief overview of mindful approaches to therapy, particularly [[family therapy]], starting with a discussion of [[mysticism]] and emphasizing the value of a mindful therapist.

;Morita therapy
The Japanese psychiatrist [[Shoma Morita]], who trained in Zen meditation, developed [[Morita therapy]] upon principles of mindfulness and non-attachment. Since the beginnings of [[Gestalt therapy]] in the early 1940s, mindfulness, referred to as "awareness", has been an essential part of its theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Gestalt theory concepts |url= http://www.gestalttheory.com/concepts |accessdate= 25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools===
In 2012 Congressman [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]] of Ohio published ''A Mindful Nation'', and has received a $1 million federal grant to teach mindfulness in schools in his home district.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt;

[[Mindful Kids Miami, Inc.(MKM)]] is a tax-exempt, 501 (c)(3), non-profit corporation established in 2011 and dedicated to making age-appropriate mindfulness training available to school children in Miami-Dade County public and private schools. This is primarily accomplished by training educators and other child care providers to incorporate mindfulness practices in the children’s daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.Mindfulkidsmiami.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Susan Kaiser Greenland#Work|The Inner Kids Program]], a mindfulness-based program developed for children, was introduced into public and private school curricula in the greater Los Angeles area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.susankaisergreenland.com/inner-kids.html&lt;/ref&gt;

MindUP, a classroom-based program spearheaded by [[Goldie Hawn]]'s Hawn Foundation, teaches students to self-regulate behavior and mindfully engage in focused concentration required for academic success. For the last decade, MindUP has trained teachers in over 1,000 schools in cities from Arizona to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thehawnfoundation.org/mindup/ |title= MindUP™ |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holistic Life Foundation, a non-profit organization that created an in-school mindfulness program called Mindful Moment, is currently serving almost 350 students daily at Robert W. Coleman Elementary School and approximately 1300 students at Patterson Park High School in Baltimore, Maryland. At Patterson High School, the Mindful Moment program engages the school's faculty along with the students during a 15-minute mindfulness practice at the beginning and end of each school day.

Mindful Life Project, a non-profit 501(c)3 based out of Richmond, California, teaches mindfulness to elementary school students in underserved schools in the South Richmond school district. Utilizing curriculum, “Rise-Up” is a regular school day intervention program serving 430 students weekly, while “Mindful Community” is currently implemented at six South Richmond partner schools. These in-school mindfulness programs have been endorsed by Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who has recommended additional funding to expand the program in order to serve all Richmond youth.

=== Education ===
Mindfulness practices are becoming more common within educational institutions including [[Elementary school (United States)|Elementary]] and [[Secondary school|Secondary]] schools. This has been referred to as part of a 'contemplative turn' in education that has emerged since the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref name="Ergas &amp; Todd"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Oren |editor1-last=Ergas |editor2-first=Sharon |editor2-last=Todd |title=Philosophy East/West: Exploring intersections between educational and contemplative practices |date=2016 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |edition=1st |isbn=978-1-119-14733-6 }}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applications of mindfulness in schools are aimed at calming and relaxation of students as well as for students and educators to build compassion and empathy for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00240.x |pmid=22905038 |pmc=3420012 |title=Contemplative Practices and Mental Training: Prospects for American Education |journal=Child Development Perspectives |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=146–53 |year=2012 |last1=j.

Within educational systems, the application of mindfulness practices shows an improvement of students' attention and focus, emotional regulation, creativity, and problem solving skills.&lt;ref name="Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz &amp; Walach 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00603 |pmid=25071620 |pmc=4075476 |title=Mindfulness-based interventions in schools—a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |pages=603 |year=2014 |last1=Zenner |first1=Charlotte |last2=Herrnleben-Kurz |first2=Solveig |last3=Walach |first3=Harald }}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed by Ergas and Todd, the development of this field since the turn of the millennium has brought diverse possibilities as well as complexities, given the origins of mindfulness within [[Buddhism]] and the processes of its secularization and measurement based on science.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Renshaw and Cook state, “As scientific interest in the utility of Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) in schools grew steadily, popular interest in mindfulness in schools seemed to grow exponentially”.&lt;ref name="Renshaw, T. L. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pits.21978 |title=Introduction to the Special Issue: Mindfulness in the Schools-Historical Roots, Current Status, and Future Directions |journal=Psychology in the Schools |volume=54 |pages=5–12 |year=2017 |last1=Renshaw |first1=Tyler L |last2=Cook |first2=Clayton R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite research on mindfulness being comparatively unexamined, especially with young students, the practice has seen a spike in use within the educational arena. “A relatively recent addition to discourse around preventing school expulsion and failure, mindfulness is gaining popularity for its potential to improve students’ social, emotional, behavioral, and learning-related cognitive control, thereby improving academic outcomes”.&lt;ref name="Eklund, K. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pits.21983 |title=Gauging Mindfulness in Children and Youth: School-Based Applications |journal=Psychology in the Schools |volume=54 |pages=101–14 |year=2017 |last1=Eklund |first1=Katie |last2=O'Malley |first2=Meagan |last3=Meyer |first3=Lauren }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers and educators are interested in how mindfulness can provide optimal conditions for a students’ personal development and academic success. Current research on mindfulness in education is limited but can provide insight to the potential benefits for students, and areas of improvement for future studies.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mindfulness in the classroom is being touted as a promising new intervention tool for young students. According to Choudhury and Moses, “Although still marginal and in some cases controversial, secular programs of mindfulness have been implemented with ambitious goals of improving attentional focus of pupils, social-emotional learning in “at-risk” children and youth, not least, to intervene in problems of poverty and incarceration”.&lt;ref name="Choudhury &amp; Moses 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0959354316669025 |title=Mindful interventions: Youth, poverty, and the developing brain |journal=Theory &amp; Psychology |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=591–606 |year=2016 |last1=Choudhury |first1=Suparna |last2=Moses |first2=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging research is concerned with studying teachers and programs using mindfulness practices with students, and is discovering tension arising from the moral reframing of eastern practices in western school settings. As cited by Renshaw and Cook, “Unlike most other approaches to contemporary school-based intervention, which are squarely grounded in behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and ecological systems theories, MBIs have their origins in Eastern religious traditions”.&lt;ref name="Renshaw, T. L. 2016"/&gt; Some school administrators are concerned about implementing such practices, and parents have been reported to take their children out of mindfulness programs because of their personal religious beliefs.  Yet, MBI’s continue to be accepted by the mainstream in both primary and secondary schools because, “Mindfulness practices, particularly in relationship to children who might otherwise be considered broken or unredeemable, fill a critical niche – one that allows its advocates to imagine a world where people can change, become more compassionate, resilient, reflective, and aware; a world with a viable future”.&lt;ref name="Choudhury &amp; Moses 2016"/&gt; As mindfulness in education continues to develop, ethical consequences will remain a controversial issue because the generic description for the “benefits” and “results” of MBI’s are largely concerned with individual and inward-focused achievement, rather than the original Buddhist ideal of global human connection.

Available research reveals a relationship between mindfulness and attention. Semple, Lee, Rosa, &amp; Miller argue, “Anxiety can impair attention and promote emotionally reactive behaviors that interfere with the development of good study skills, so it seems reasonable that increased mindfulness would be associated with less anxiety”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10826-009-9301-y |title=A Randomized Trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children: Promoting Mindful Attention to Enhance Social-Emotional Resiliency in Children |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=218–29 |year=2009 |last1=Semple |first1=Randye J |last2=Lee |first2=Jennifer |last3=Rosa |first3=Dinelia |last4=Miller |first4=Lisa F }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) that found promise in managing anxiety for elementary school-aged children, and suggests that those who completed the program displayed fewer attention problems. In addition, Flook shows how an eight-week mindfulness awareness program was evaluated in a random and controlled school setting, and measured the effects of awareness practices on executive functions in elementary school children. Their findings concluded, “Participation in the mindfulness awareness program was associated with improvements in behavioral regulation, metacognition, and overall executive functions”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15377900903379125 |title=Effects of Mindful Awareness Practices on Executive Functions in Elementary School Children |journal=Journal of Applied School Psychology |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=70–95 |year=2010 |last1=Flook |first1=Lisa |last2=Smalley |first2=Susan L |last3=Kitil |first3=M.

These perspectives are a valuable source of data given that caregivers and educators interact with the children daily and across a variety of settings. According to Eklund, Omalley, and Meyer, “School-based practitioners should find promise in the evidence supporting mindfulness-based practices with children, parents, and educators”.&lt;ref name="Eklund, K. 2016"/&gt; Lastly, a third study by Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz, and Walach concluded, “Analysis suggest that mindfulness-based interventions for children and youths are able to increase cognitive capacity of attending and learning by nearly one standard deviation and yield”.&lt;ref name="Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz &amp; Walach 2014"/&gt; Application of Mindfulness-Based Interventions continue to increase in popularity and practice.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mindfulness-Based Interventions are rising across western culture, but its effectiveness in school programs is still being determined. Research contends, “Mindfulness-based approaches for adults are effective at enhancing mental health, but few controlled trials have evaluated their effectiveness among young people”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.113.126649 |pmid=23787061 |title=Effectiveness of the Mindfulness in Schools Programme: Non-randomised controlled feasibility study |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=203 |issue=2 |pages=126–31 |year=2013 |last1=Kuyken |first1=W |last2=Weare |first2=K |last3=Ukoumunne |first3=O.

A firmly controlled experiment, Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, and Wade evaluated “the impact of an existing and widely available school-based mindfulness program, no improvements were demonstrated on any outcome measured either immediately post intervention or at three-month follow-up”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2016.03.002 |pmid=27054828 |title=Effectiveness of a school-based mindfulness program for transdiagnostic prevention in young adolescents |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=81 |pages=1–11 |year=2016 |last1=Johnson |first1=Catherine |last2=Burke |first2=Christine |last3=Brinkman |first3=Sally |last4=Wade |first4=Tracey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many questions remain on which practices best implement effective and reliable mindfulness programs at schools, and further research is needed to identify the optimal methods and measurement tools for mindfulness in education.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Several issues pertaining to the assessment of mindfulness have also been identified including the current use of self-report questionnaires.&lt;ref name=Grossman_2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.02.001 |pmid= 18374739 |title=On measuring mindfulness in psychosomatic and psychological research |journal= Journal of Psychosomatic Research |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=405–08 |year=2008 |last1= Grossman |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Creswell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keng2011"/&gt; Potential for bias also exists to the extent that researchers in the field are also practitioners and possibly subject to pressures to publish positive or significant results.{{R|"Nisbet"}}

Various scholars have criticized how mindfulness has been defined or represented in recent western psychology publications.&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wallace06"&gt;{{cite book |title=The attention revolution: Unlocking the power of the focused mind |last=Wallace |first=B. Alan |authorlink=B. Alan Wallace  |year=2006  |publisher=Wisdom Publications  |location=Boston |isbn=978-0861712762 |url= https://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip065/2005037195.html  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These modern understandings depart significantly from the accounts of mindfulness in early Buddhist texts and authoritative commentaries in the Theravada and Indian Mahayana traditions.&lt;ref name="wallace06" /&gt;{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name="chiesa13"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12671-012-0123-4 |title=The Difficulty of Defining Mindfulness: Current Thought and Critical Issues |journal=Mindfulness |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=255–68 |year=2012 |last1=Chiesa |first1=Alberto }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Valerio has introduced the idea that conflict between academic disciplines over how mindfulness is defined, understood, and popularly presented may be indicative of a personal, institutional, or paradigmatic battle for ownership over mindfulness, one where academics, researchers, and other writers are invested as individuals in much the same way as religious communities.&lt;ref name="Valerio 1–27"/&gt;

===Shortcomings===
The popularization of mindfulness as a "commodity"{{sfn|Safran|2014}} has been criticized, being termed "McMindfulness" by some critics.&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-purser/beyond-mcmindfulness_b_3519289.html Ron Purser and David Loy (2013), ''Beyond McMindfulness'', Huffington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="TriMc"&gt;[http://tricycle.org/trikedaily/trike-contributing-editor-david-loy-takes-mcmindfulness/ Alex Caring-Lobel (2013), ''Trike Contributing Editor David Loy takes on "McMindfulness" '', Tricycle Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bazzano|2014}} According to Safran, the popularity of mindfulness is the result of a marketing strategy:{{sfn|Safran|2014}}
"McMindfulness is the marketing of a constructed dream; an idealized lifestyle; an identity makeover."{{sfn|Safran|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safran, Jeremy D., PhD. "McMindfulness." Psychology Today. n.p., 13 June 2014. Web. 2 April 2015. &lt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/straight-talk/201406/mcmindfulness&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Purser and Loy, mindfulness is not being used as a means to awaken to insight in the "unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion,"&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; but reshaped into a "banal, therapeutic, self-help technique" that has the opposite effect of reinforcing those passions.&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; While mindfulness is marketed as a means to reduce stress, in a Buddhist context it is part of an all-embracing ethical program to foster "wise action, social harmony, and compassion."&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; The privatization of mindfulness neglects the societal and organizational causes of stress and discomfort, instead propagating adaptation to these circumstances.&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, "[A]bsent a sharp social critique, Buddhist practices could easily be used to justify and stabilize the status quo, becoming a reinforcement of [[consumer capitalism]]."&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; The popularity of this new brand of mindfulness has resulted in the commercialization of meditation through self-help books, guided meditation classes, and mindfulness retreats.

Buddhist commentators have criticized the movement as being presented as equivalent to Buddhist practice, while in reality it is very possibly denatured with undesirable consequences, such as being ungrounded in the traditional reflective morality and therefore, astray from traditional Buddhist ethics. Criticisms suggest it to be either de-moralized or re-moralized into clinically based ethics. The conflict is often presented in concern to the teacher's credentials and qualifications, rather than the student's actual practice. Reformed Buddhist-influenced practices are being standardized and manualized in a clearly distinct separation from Buddhism seen as a religion based in monastic temples, as expressed as mindfulness in a new psychology ethic practiced in modern meditation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shonin|first1=Edo|title=Buddhist Foundations of Mindfulness (Mindfulness in Behavioral Health)|date=August 27, 2015|publisher=Springer|pages=90–94|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks===
In media reports, people have attributed unexpected effects of increasing fear and anxiety, panic or "meltdowns" after practicing, which they suggest could expose bipolar vulnerability or repressed [[PTSD]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foster|first1=Dawn|title=Is mindfulness making us ill?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/23/is-mindfulness-making-us-ill|accessdate=2016-01-23|agency=Guardian News|publisher=theguardian|date=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to published peer-reviewed academic articles, these negative effects of meditation are rare for mindfulness meditation,&lt;ref name="Creswell"/&gt;&lt;ref name= SHONIN2014&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2217/cpr.14.23 |title=Are there risks associated with using mindfulness in the treatment of psychopathology? |journal=Clinical Practice |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=389–92 |year=2014 |last1=Shonin |first1=Edo |last2=Gordon |first2=William Van |last3=Griffiths |first3=Mark D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wong2018&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wong SY et al.|title= The Safety of Mindfulness-Based Interventions: a Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials |journal= Mindfulness |pages=1–14 |date=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appear to happen due to a poor understanding of what actually constitutes mindfulness/meditation practices.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SHONIN2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4299">'''Mũmbi''' is a mythological figure regarded as the mother of the [[Gĩkũyũ]] people. The word Mũmbi can be translated as "one who moulds". She was the wife of Gĩkũyũ, and ancestor to all the Agĩkũyũ people. The story of Gĩkũyũ and Mũmbi has been recorded by various writers throughout the Gĩkũyũ history; notable among them are [[Jomo Kenyatta]], the first president of independent Kenya, [[Louis Leakey]] and the prolific Gĩkũyũ writer [[Gakaara wa Wanjaũ]] and another Gĩkũyũ writer known as Mathew Njoroge Kabetũ among many others.
The  name Mumbi comes from the Bantu root verb "BA",the same root word that gives rise to "UMBA".The prefix "Mu" is the Bantu noun classifier for nouns that have souls, like humans.The verb UMBA indicates the action of moulding, shaping, designing or creating. The suffix "i" replaces the terminal "a" in the Bantu language noun or verb to create the name for the performer of the action.Being derived from a Bantu root, the word Mumbi is also widely used by the Kamba ethnic community. Among the Kamba community the name carries the same meaning as among the Kikuyu's.

==Origin==
The story of the origin of the Agĩkũyũ:

God ([[Ngai]] or Mũgai – The Divider) created Gĩkũyũ the father of the tribe and took him on top of Kĩrĩ-Nyaga ([[Mount Kenya]]) and showed him all the land that he had given him: West from Mount Kenya to the [[Aberdare range|Aberdares]], on to [[Ngong Hills]] and [[Kilimambogo]], then north to [[Garba Tula]]. He further promised Gikuyu that he would bequeath him all what Gikuyu laid his eyes on. He then pointed to him a spot full of fig trees (Mũkũyũ) and he commanded him to descend and establish his homestead on the selected spot known as Mũkũrwe wa Gathanga (in present-day [[Muranga County]]). When Gĩkũyũ descended to the spot he found a beautiful wife waiting for him, Mũmbi. Together, Gĩkũyũ and Mũmbi had nine beautiful daughters: Wanjirũ, Wambũi, Wanjikũ, Wangũi aka Waithiegeni, Wangeci aka Waithĩra, Wanjeeri aka Waceera, Nyambura aka Wakĩũrũ, Wairimũ aka Gathiigia, and Wangarĩ. These nine daughters founded the nine Kikuyu clans. Gikuyu and Mumbi had a tenth daughter named Wamũyũ aka Warigia, who as a result of having went on to found or establish the Akamaba tribe. All the ten daughters' names are very popular names for Gikũyũ females today.

When the time came for the 9 eldest daughters to marry, the youngest Wamũyũ not yet being of age, Gĩkũyũ prayed to God under a holy fig tree (Mũkũyũ, some say Mũgumo), as was his tradition, to send him sons-in-law. He offered a lamb as sacrifice and as the fire was consuming the lamb’s body, nine men appeared and walked out of the flames. Gĩkũyũ took them home and each daughter married the man who was the same height as she was, and together they gave rise to the nine of the full-nine clans to which all Gĩkũyũs belong. Wamũyũ or Warigia got a child out of wedlock. These clans are the Anjirũ, Agacikũ, Ambũi, Angũi aka Aithiegeni, Angechi aka Aithĩrandũ, Aacera, Ambura aka Aakĩũrũ aka Eethaga, Airimũ aka Agathiigia, Angarĩ aka Aithekahuno and Aicakamũyũ. 

The Agĩkũyũ refer to each other as Andũ a Nyũmba ya Mũmbi or persons of the house or home of Mũmbi. Shortly before a state of emergency was declared by the imperialists in colonial Kenya on the night of 20 October 1952, the name of Mũmbi was invoked as a rallying call to unite the Agĩkũyũ in a fight for the independence of Kenya, under the banner of what came to be known as [[Mau Mau Uprising]]. Gakaara wa Wanjaũ published the Gĩkũyũ and Mũmbi creed, for which the colonial government put him in detention till 1960. Parallel to that several song books would be published under the name of Gĩkũyũ and Mũmbi.
 
Mũmbi is used as a female Gĩkũyũ name.

The '''Nizamiyyah''' (from {{lang-fa|نظامیه}}, {{lang-ar|النظامیة}}) are a group of the medieval institutions of higher education established by [[Nizam al-Mulk|Khwaja Nizam al-Mulk]] in the eleventh century in  [[Greater Iran|Iran]]. The name ''nizamiyyah'' derives from his name. Founded at the beginning of the [[Seljuk Empire]], these [[Sunni Islam]] theological schools are considered to be the model of later [[madrasah]]s, or [[Islam]]ic religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;Ed(s). "al- Niẓāmiyya , al- Madrasa." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010, retrieved 20(03/2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nizamiyyah institutes were among the first well organized [[Ancient higher-learning institutions|institutions of higher learning]] in the [[Muslim world]]. The quality of education was among the highest in the Islamic world, and they were even renowned in Europe. They were supported financially, politically, and spiritually by the royal establishment and the elite class. Some scholars have suggested that the establishment of the Nizamiyya madrasas was in fact an attempt to thwart the growing influence of another group of Muslims, the [[Ismailis]], in the region. Indeed, Nizam al-Mulk devoted a significant section in his famous ''Books of Politics (Siyāsatnāma)'' to refuting the Ismaili doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous and celebrated of all the nizamiyyah schools was [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]] (established 1065), where Khwaja Nizam al-Mulk appointed the distinguished philosopher and theologian, [[al-Ghazali]], as a professor.  Persian poet [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]] was a student of the Baghdad Nizamiyyah.  Other nizamiyyah schools were located in [[Nishapur]], [[Amol]], [[Balkh]], [[Herat]] and [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]].

Nizam ul-Mulk was finally assassinated en route from [[Isfahan]] to [[Baghdad]] in 1092 CE. According to several books, he was assassinated by a member of [[Hashshashin]], a group of the [[Ismaili]] sect of [[Shi'a Islam]].

According to [[Mughatil ibn Bakri]], a staff member of the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]], he alleges that Nizam al-Mulk converted to [[Shia Islam]] after a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]-Shia debate held on the orders of Sultan [[Malik Shah I]], who also converted to Shia'ism. But it is thereafter that they were both assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Mughatil ibn Bakri]] |title=In search of Truth in Baghdad (در جستجوی حق در بغداد), also appearing under the title راهي به سوي حقيقت |isbn= 964-93287-8-5 |page=134-136 |url=http://www.iran-books.com/Book/detail.asp?key=5-8-93287-964}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narration is disputed, however, by most historians and Sunni scholars.

The [[curriculum]] initially focused on [[religious studies]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Arabic literature]], and [[Arabic numerals|arithmetic]], and later extended to [[Historiography of early Islam|history]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|physical sciences]], and [[Islamic music|music]].&lt;ref&gt;B.G. Massialas &amp; S.A. Jarrar (1987), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41857917 "Conflicts in education in the Arab world: The present challenge"], ''Arab Studies Quarterly'': "''Subjects such as history, mathematics, physical sciences, and music were added to the curriculum of Al-Nizamiyah at a later time.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it is actively engaged worldwide in the [[peace movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Queen. Engaged Buddhism in the West.

Prophets of Peace. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1999. pp. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The main practice of Nichiren Buddhism is to chant ''[[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]]''. Nipponzan-Myōhōji monks, nuns and followers beat hand drums while chanting the ''Daimoku'', and walk throughout the world promoting peace and non-violence. They try to explain the meaning of their ministry to all wishing to understand it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ukrainian Traditionalist Club|date=March 9, 2013|title=Традиционализм. Традиции Востока.

==Peace pagodas and pilgrimages==

[[Image:Stupa in Gotemba.jpg|thumb|left|Stupa in [[Gotemba]], Shizuoka, Japan]] 
The most recognizable achievement of Nipponzan-Myōhōji is [[peace pagoda]]s ([[stupa]]s), that have been erected in various locations around the world, the first of which was inaugurated in 1954 at [[Kumamoto]] in Japan. Since then cities such as [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photoboxgallery.com/buddhism/|title=Thank you for visiting ProGalleries - PhotoBox|author=|date=|website=PhotoBoxGallery.com|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Delhi]], [[Vienna]] and [[Tokyo]] have all received peace pagodas.

It has also undertaken numerous peace pilgrimages made by its followers. One of the most prominent of these was the 1994–1995 pilgrimage from [[Auschwitz]] to [[Hiroshima]] by way of [[Bosnia]], [[Iraq]], [[Cambodia]] and other countries then experiencing the effects of war. That pilgrimage was known as [[Peace walk#The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life|The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life.]] A more recent walk was the 2010 Walk for a Nuclear Free Future, a walk across the United States in support of a nuclear-free future.

Many{{Who|date=June 2017}} argue that the order shows a certain political stance with its active opposition to the nuclear industry in Japan and U.S involvement in [[Okinawa]]. This has led to a difference in views with fellow Nichiren sect [[Soka Gakkai]], who are often viewed as more [[conservative]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Our Lady of Aparecida''' ({{lang-pt|'''Nossa Senhora Aparecida'''}} or {{lang-pt|'''Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida'''|links=no}} {{IPA-pt|ˈnɔsɐ siˈɲɔɾɐ dɐ kõsejˈsɐ̃w ɐpɐɾeˈsidɐ|}}) a title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] in the traditional form associated with the [[Immaculate Conception]] associated with a clay statue bearing the same title. The image is widely venerated by [[Brazil]]ian [[Catholics]], who consider her as the principal [[patroness]] of [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="patron" /&gt; Historical accounts state that the statue was originally found by three fishermen who miraculously caught many fish after invoking the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The statue is currently housed in the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida]] in [[Aparecida]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Brazil.

Colonial documents and papal bulls have referred to the image as ''Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida''. The Roman Rite feast day of Our Lady of Aparecida is on October 12, which since 1980 is also a [[public holiday]] in Brazil. The building in which it is venerated was granted the title of [[minor basilica]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1980, and is the largest [[Shrines to the Virgin Mary|Marian shrine]] in the world,&lt;ref name="NCR"&gt;Allen, John. [http://ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/look-ahead-benedict-brazil "A look ahead to Benedict in Brazil"]. National Catholic Reporter. May 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; being able to hold up to 45,000 worshippers.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;

Controversy about the statue was ignited in May 1978 by an intruder who stole the clay statue, which  was smashed as he was apprehended, from its shrine, and again in 1995, when a Protestant minister insulted and vandalized a copy of the statue on Brazilian national television.

The following papal documents concern the famed statue:

* [[Pope Leo XIII]] mentioned the Brazilian devotion to ''Nossa Senhora da Conçeicão Aparecida'' in 1903
* [[Pope Saint Pius X]] granted a [[canonical coronation]] to the image on 8 December 1904. 
* [[Pope Pius XI]] declared Mary under this title Patroness of Brazil through a papal bull of 16 July 1930, signed by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Eugenio Pacelli]].
* [[Pope Paul VI]] granted the image her first [[golden rose]] on 12 August 1967. 
* [[Pope John Paul II]] consecrated her new shrine and on the same date raised it to the rank of [[minor basilica]] on 4 July 1980&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite news| title=Our Lady of Aparecida, Brazil| url=http://www.catholicvoice.ie/features/2009/07/19/our_lady_of_aparecida_brazil| work=Catholic Voice| author=William Thomas| date=July 19, 2009| publisher=CatholicVoice.ie| accessdate=February 22, 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323012623/http://www.catholicvoice.ie/features/2009/07/19/our_lady_of_aparecida_brazil| archivedate=March 23, 2013| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1980/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19800704_aparecida-brazil_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to the account of the discovery of the statue in October 1717, Dom Pedro de Almeida, [[Count of Assumar]] and Governor of the Province of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]], was passing through the area of [[Guaratinguetá]], a small city in the [[Paraíba do Sul|Paraíba river]] valley,&lt;ref name=dayton&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/resources/engone.html "Brazil: Our Lady "Aparecida" (who appeared)", Marian Titles in the Popular Religiosity of Latin America, Univ. of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt; during a trip to [[Ouro Preto|Vila Rica]], an important gold mining site.

As the people of Guaratinguetá decided to hold a feast in his honour, three fishermen, Domingos Garcia, João Alves, and Filipe Pedroso went down to the Paraíba waters to fish. The fishermen prayed to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception that God would grant a good catch. The fishermen, having a run of bad luck, cast their nets in the River Paraiba and dragged up a headless statue of the Virgin Mary. They also salvaged the head and, according to the legend, then netted plenty of fish.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/06/us-brazil-pope-basilica-idUSN0236838720070506 "Brazil's giant basilica is backdrop for Pope visit", May 6, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; After cleaning the statue, they found that it was a black version of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref name="patron" /&gt; Legend has it that when the fishermen recovered the body, then the head, the slender figure of the Aparecida Virgin became so heavy that they couldn't budge it.&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt;

The fishermen named the statue ''Nossa Senhora da Conceição Aparecida'' ({{lang-en|Our Lady of the Conception who appeared}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicmedia.net/halo/eng/aparecid.htm Our Lady Aparecida profile] at Catholic Media.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2014}}  Neighbors began to venerate the statue, which came to be known as Our Lady of Aparecida, and devotion grew. The first chapel was built in 1745.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;

Devotion to the statue grew rapidly, particularly among [[Afro-Brazilians]], not only for its [[black Madonna]] status, but also because it was reported to have performed a miracle for an enslaved young man. Over the years following its discovery, veneration of the Virgin invoked as Aparecida increased as many miracles were attributed to her.&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt; For the following fifteen years, the statue remained within Filipe Pedroso's family, and neighbors came to venerate it. Stories of Our Lady of Aparecida's miracles were spread throughout Brazil, and the Pedroso family built her a [[chapel]] which soon became too small for so many worshippers. In 1737 the priest of Guaratinguetá built her a chapel&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt; on the Morro dos Coqueiros (Hill of Coconut Palms), where public visits began in July 1745.

The number of worshippers increased dramatically, and in 1834 work on a larger church was begun; this became known as the "Old Basilica" when work on the even larger "New Basilica" was started in 1955; it received pontifical approbation in 1980.&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt;

===The image===
According to a local tale the clay statue was imported from [[Portugal]]; others say that it was made by Frei Agostinho de Jesus, a [[monk]] from São Paulo known for crafting artistic sacred images in clay. The small statue is less than three feet tall.&lt;ref name="NCR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;de Vries, Lloyd. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/11/world/main2790338.shtml?source=RSSattr=World_2790338 "Pope Canonizes First Brazilian Saint"]. [[CBS News]]. May 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The image was made around 1650, and must have been underwater for years, since it lost its original [[polychromy]].&lt;ref name="dayton" /&gt;

The image is dark brown, and covered by a stiff dark blue robe of richly embroidered thick cloth emblazoned with the flags of Brazil and the Vatican City State with golden clasps. An imperial crown was added in 1904.&lt;ref name="dayton" /&gt;

A [[bronze]] replica of the same image is sponsored by the Embassy of Brazil to the Vatican and was approved for installation within the [[Gardens of the Vatican City]] under the mandate of [[Pope Francis]], officially held on 3 September 2016.

===First patronage===
At the written request of Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]], [[Pope Leo XII]] declared [[Saint Peter of Alcantara]] the "Patron of Brazil" on 31 May 1826. The ruler of Brazil at that time, Pedro I (born Prince Pedro de Alcantara), was named after Saint Peter of Alcantara.&lt;ref&gt;Plinio Maria Solimeo, [http://www.catolicismo.com.br/materia/materia.cfm?IDmat=C8E2C17D-E2CA-E7E2-A60908BAB4B8FAED&amp;mes=Outubro1999 ''São Pedro de Alcântara Padroeiro do Brasil''] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friar Stephano Piat Joseph, OFM, St. Peter of Alcantara, Patron of Brazil, translated from the French language by Father Clarence Neotti OFM, Editora Vozes, Petrópolis, 1962, page. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as the Virgin Mary outranks St. Peter of Alcantara in the Catholic hierarchy of saints, with the proclamation of the Virgin Aparecida as the principal Catholic [[patron saint]] of Brazil, St. Peter became the secondary patron.

===Canonical coronation===
On the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] 1904, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1854 proclamation of the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]], the statue of Our Lady Aparecida was [[Canonically crowned]] by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Paulo|archbishop of São Paulo]], Lino Deodato Rodrigues, at the decree of the [[Holy See]] and in the presence of the [[Apostolic Nuncio]]. The Coronation was performed in the name and on behalf of [[Pope Pius X]] who granted this approval.&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt; The papal coronation of the image of Aparecida was a major event attended by many people and by civil authorities including President [[Rodrigues Alves]], who made the point of witnessing the act in spite of the separation of Church and State that had been instituted when Brazil became a Republic, less than twenty years before. The gold used for the manufacture of the Crown was donated by the head of Brazil's Imperial Family, the exiled [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]].

After the pontifical coronation of 1904 the Holy See granted a [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine office]] and Mass for her [[feast day]].

Twenty years later, the village that had grown around the church on Coqueiros hill became a municipality, named after the saint.

==Papal Bull of 1930==
On 16 July 1930, [[Pope Pius XI]] declared the Immaculate Conception under the title of ''Our Lady of Aparecida'' to be the principal patroness of Brazil, namely widespread in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro|Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro]].

The pontifical decree indicated that [[Pope Leo XIII]] granted the approval on the devotion of the image under the title ''"Nossa Senhora da Conceição Apparecida''". In addition, Saint [[Pope Pius X]] established the Office of the Mass under this honor and allowing this devotion to spread due to the widespread piety of the Brazilian people. The Papal decree mentions the 1904 solid gold crown given to the image (assumingly from [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil]]). It does not however, mention the shrine being elevated to a [[minor basilica]].

Furthermore, the devotion was researched and approved by Cardinal [[Camillo Laurenti]], Prefect of the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]]. The papal bull was signed and witnessed by Cardinal [[Eugenio Pacelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Acta Apostolica Sedis – 1931 – Page 7 – Beata Virgo Maria Immaculata Sub Titulo Apparecida – Principalis Patrona Brasiliae Constituitur. – http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-23-1931-ocr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associação Redemptionis Sacramentum (text in Latin and Portuguese) – http://ars-the.blogspot.com.br/2012/10/a-carta-apostolica-de-pio-xi-que.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the wake of the papal decree naming Our Lady Aparecida Patroness of Brazil, on July 16, 1930, Cardinal [[Sebastião da Silveira Cintra|Sebastião Leme da Silveira Cintra]], the Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro (then the Capital of Brazil), rededicated Brazil to the Virgin under this Marian title.

==Later years==
Up until the early 1950s, Aparecida remained an unassuming city with a small community of [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorists]].&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt; They arrived from the sanctuary of the Virgin of  [[Altötting]] in Germany and took on the responsibility for the shrine of Our Lady Aparecida, making it the first Redemptorist parish in Latin America.&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt; Devotion to the Marian image grew under Padre [[Vítor Coelho]] (1899-1987), a Redemptorist priest and catechist.&lt;ref&gt;http://santuarionacional.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/imagens.png&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, due to the growth of the Catholic community around the Marian Shrine of Aparecida, the Holy See decided to erect the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Aparecida, separating its territory in part from the Archdiocese of São Paulo and in part from the Diocese of Taubaté and transferring three suffragan Dioceses that previously were subject to the Metropolitan Archbishop of São Paulo to form the new ecclesiastical province of Aparecida. The new See was led by administrators until 1964, when the first Archbishop of Aparecida was appointed.

Contrary to popular belief, [[John Paul II]] was the first Pope to consecrate the shrine with the title of [[Basilica]] on July 4, 1980. In his Apostolic message, the Pontiff mentioned the coronation of 1904, the Patronage granted in 1930, and his culminating purpose of consecration of the shrine as a Basilica during that time. By research in Vatican documents, there is no mention of 1908 proclamations of the shrine as a Basilica by the Pope or any Vatican prelate.&lt;ref name="vatican.va" /&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] installed a replica of the same Marian image within the [[Vatican Gardens]] in September 2016 via the diplomatic efforts of the Brazilian embassy to the Holy See.

===Assault on the image===
{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}
[[File:Atentado-nsaparecida-corpo.png|thumb|220px|left|Pieces of the vandalized Marian image taken in 1978.]]
The image became the source of religious conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, primarily driven by non-mainline churches identified with [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]], [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], or [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] theology, including all branches of [[Pentecostalism]], due to the nature of Catholic [[Marian devotion]] associated with the religious image.

On May 16, 1978, a person identified as a member of a Protestant sect took the statue from its niche on the Basilica after the last [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the day. He was chased by guards and some of the church goers.&lt;ref name="Pli"&gt;[[Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira|Oliveira, Plinio Corrêa]]. [http://www.traditioninaction.org/SOD/j227sd_OLAparecida_10-12.html "Feast Days of Our Lady: Our Lady Aparecida – October 12"].  Tradition in Action, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; As he was caught, the statue fell to the ground breaking to pieces;&lt;ref name="Pli" /&gt; a group of artists and artisans pieced it together again.&lt;ref name="Pli" /&gt;
 
On her feast day in 1995, a public holiday, an incident later known as "[[kicking of the saint]]" took place when [[televangelist]] Sérgio Von Helder (or Helde), of the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]] (UCKG), insulted and kicked a replica of Our Lady of Aparecida, and said that "it could not do anything for you", on a late-night religious program broadcast by UCKG television station [[Rede Record]].&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Jack (November 24, 1995). [https://web.archive.org/web/20131012101956/http://www.culteducation.com/reference/universal/universal3.html "Kicking of icon outrages Brazil Catholics"]. ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''.

The event was perceived by Catholics as a major act of religious intolerance, causing a public outcry. Several temples of the UCKG were targeted by protesters, and Von Helder was transferred to [[South Africa]] until the end of the controversy.&lt;ref name="NCR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/864623.stm "Church makes airwaves"]. BBC. August 3, 2000. Retrieved 2009-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==&lt;nowiki/&gt;The New Basilica==
{{Main|Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida}}
[[File:Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida, 2007.jpg|thumb|The National Basilica, located in Aparecida, São Paulo, Brazil]]
In the mid-20th century, as the popularity of Our Lady of Aparecida grew, the construction of a much larger building to shelter the image became necessary. In 1955, work on the present [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida]] was begun. Architect [[Benedito Calixto]] designed a building in the form of a [[Greek cross]].&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt; It can hold up to 45,000 people.&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt;

On July 4, 1980, while still under construction, the new church was consecrated by [[Pope John Paul II]] and given the title of Minor Basilica.&lt;ref name="NCR" /&gt; It is currently the largest Marian temple and the second largest Basilica in the world, second only to [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] in the [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref name="NCR" /&gt;

Since then, the two Basilicas in the city of Aparecida have been known as the "Old Basilica" and the "New Basilica". Upon its completion, the Brazilian Conference of Catholic Bishops declared the new Basilica a National Shrine.

As the National Shrine, dedicated to the patroness of Brazil, one of the functions of the Basilica is to function as a site of pilgrimage for laborers. The traditional pilgrimage of the laborers takes place each year on [[Independence Day (Brazil)|Brazil's independence holiday]], September 7.&lt;ref name="naza" /&gt; According to recent estimates, the Basilica attracts about 8 million pilgrims a year.&lt;ref name="NCR" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lugo, Luis. [http://pewforum.org/Christian/Catholic/Pope-to-Visit-Pentecostalized-Brazil.aspx "Pope to Visit 'Pentecostalized' Brazil"]. [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life]]. April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Our Lady of Aparecida on Brazilian Catholic society is incalculable. In 1992 a study showed that 296 parishes were dedicated to her while five [[cathedral]]s had the same title. In addition, many towns are named after the Virgin and so are many Brazilian women and girls. The modern art styled [[cathedral of Brasilia]] designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] is dedicated to Our Lady Aparecida, as [[Brasilia]] is the national capital and she is invoked as Brazil's special protector.

In 2004, to commemorate the centennial of the pontifical coronation commanded by Pope Pius X and the 150th anniversary of the dogmatic definition of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the statue of Our Lady of Aparecida was granted a renewed canonical coronation by the Holy See. The renewed coronation was presided by the Archbishop emeritus of Rio de Janeiro, [[Eugênio de Araújo Sales|Cardinal Eugênio Sales]], in the capacity of [[Papal legate|special papal envoy]] of Pope John Paul II.

On May 12, 2007 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] granted the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady Aparecida a [[Golden Rose]]. The "Old Basilica" also possesses a Golden Rose, awarded by [[Pope Paul VI]] on August 12, 1967 and presented by the Apostolic Nuncio; it was a gift of the Holy See to mark the Pope's participation in the commemorations of the 250th anniversary of the devotion to the Virgin of Aparecida. The "New Basilica"'s Golden Rose was presented by Pope Benedict, who visited the Basilica and celebrated Mass there during his 2007 Apostolic visit to Brazil. [[Pope Francis]] celebrated Mass at the shrine on July 24, 2013 and entrusted his pontificate as well as the World Youth Day to the maternal protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/07/24/wyd-2013-pope-entrusts-youth-to-virgin-mary-at-aparecida-shrine |title=WYD 2013: Pope entrusts youth to Virgin Mary at Aparecida shrine|work=[[Catholic Herald]] |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feast day==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2017}}
Since the 19th century, the Feast Day of Our Lady Aparecida is celebrated on October 12. The date coincides with the foundation of the [[Empire of Brazil]] in 1822, and is regarded in Brazilian culture as [[Children's Day]]. In the Roman Rite Catholic Liturgical Calendar approved for Brazil, the day of Our Lady Aparecida ranks as a solemnity, and is a holy day of obligation. The feast's rank as a day of precept was established by the Holy See at the request of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops.

The feast day of Our Lady of Aparecida has been a National Holiday in Brazil since 1980. The federal statute declaring October 12 a national holiday in honour of "Our Lady of Aparecida", Patroness of Brazil, was passed by Congress and signed into law on June 30, 1980, during [[Pope John Paul II]]'s first visit to the country; that was also the first visit by a Pope to Brazil, and during that visit the "New Basilica" of Aparecida was consecrated.

== Cultural references ==
The [[telenovela]] ''A Padroeira'' (The Patroness), broadcast on [[Rede Globo]] between June 18, 2001 and February 23, 2002, was a fictional portrayal of the finding of the Our Lady of Aparecida statue,&lt;ref name="NCR" /&gt; loosely based on the 1865 novel ''As Minas de Prata'' by [[José de Alencar]], which itself had been adapted for the telenovela format in 1966 by the now defunct [[TV Excelsior]].

A '''periodeutes''', or '''periodeutai''' was a kind of specially-ordained visiting [[priest]] in various [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern churches]].

The fifty-seventh canon of the [[Council of Laodicea|Synod of Laodicea]] (380) prescribed that the [[Chorbishop|chorepiscopi]] should be replaced by periodeutai, i.e., priests who have no fixed residence and act as organs of the city bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Chorepiscopi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Maronite Church]], a periodeutes or ''bardūt'' is "a kind of [[vicar forane]] who acts for the bishop in the inspection of the rural clergy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913 | wstitle =Maronites | author = Jérôme Labourt | accessdate = May 9, 2014

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5772">A '''protopope''', or '''protopresbyter''', is a priest of higher rank in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and the [[Byzantine Catholic]] Churches, generally corresponding to [[Western Christianity]]'s [[archpriest]] or the [[Latin Church]]'s [[dean (religion)|dean]].

==History==
The rights and duties of these dignitaries have varied to some extent at different times and in different local Churches. Roughly, the titles [[archpriest]] (in [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀρχιπρεσβὐτερος}} ''archipresbyteros''), [[protoiereus]] ({{lang|grc|πρωτοιερεύς}} ''protoiereus'', {{lang|grc|πρωτοπρεσβύτερος}} ''protopresbyteros''), protopope may be taken as meaning the same thing, though they have occasionally been distinguished.
 
The general idea is that the archpriest has the highest rank in his order; he comes immediately after the [[bishop]]. In the fifth century he appears as head of the college of priests, as the bishop's delegate for certain duties of [[Canonical visitation|visitation]] and canonical judgment, as his representative in case of absence or death (''[[sede vacante]]'').&lt;ref&gt;So [[Liberatus]]: "Breviarium", XIV (''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' LXVIII, 1016.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore combined the offices of the Roman Catholic [[dean of the chapter]], [[vicar-general]] and [[vicar capitular]]. The title recurs constantly in the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Bingham, op. cit., I, 292 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At [[Byzantine Empire|imperial]] [[Constantinople]] there was an elaborately organized court of ecclesiastical persons around the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]], whose various places in choir when the patriarch celebrated are given in the [[Euchologion]] together with a statement of their duties. Among these the protopope had the first place on the left. "The protopope stands above the left choir when the [[pontiff]] celebrates, he gives to him [the pontiff] [[Holy Communion]] and in the same way the pontiff to the protopope and he has all first places [τὰ πρωτεῖα πάντα -''ta proteia panta''] in the church" (Goar, 225). Under him the "second one" (ὁ δευτερεύων ''ho deutereuon''), takes his place in his absence (ibid.). So also Leo Allatius's list, where it is said further that: "he holds the place [κρατῶν τόπον - ''kraton topon'', as deputy] of the pontiff" (ibid., 229). He is promoted by presentation to the patriarch, who lays his hand on him with prayer, and the clergy cry "''[[Axios (acclamation)|axios]]''" (ἄξιος) three times (the rite from Allatius is given by Goar, 238). Goar notes that the protopope, at least to some extent, succeeded to the place of the [[chorepiscopus]]. He could [[ordination|ordain]] [[lector]]s; at [[concelebration]]s where no bishop is present he presided and said the [[ekphonesis]] (ἐκφώνησις - exclamations chanted aloud at the end of prayers and [[ektenia|litanies]]). In the bishop's absence he took his place as president, and had jurisdiction over his fellow-clergy. George Kodinos (fourteenth century) says of the protopope: "he is first in the tribunal [τοῦ βήματος - ''tou bematos'', in authority] holding the second place after the pontiff" (De Officiis, I, quoted by Goar 237). 

Distinct from the official of the patriarchal court, though bearing the same title, were the protopopes in the country parishes. They correspond to Catholic [[rural dean]]s, having delegate episcopal jurisdiction for minor cases, from which appeal may be made to the bishop. So [[Theodore Balsamon]] (twelfth century): "It is forbidden by the [[canon law|canons]] that there should be bishops in small towns and villages, and because of this they ordain for these priests who are protopopes and chorepiscopi" (''[[Syntagma (Balsamon)|Syntagma]]'', III, 142). There are cases in which a protopope in a remote place has episcopal jurisdiction, but not orders, like some vicars Apostolic, or the archpriests in England from 1599 to 1621. In such cases they are distinguished from archpriests and have such officials under them (so the introduction to Nicholas Bulgaris' "Sacred Catechism", Venice, l681). 

In modern times the Orthodox (and Eastern Catholic) title of protopope often means hardly more than a complimentary title conveying a certain rank and precedence with sometimes a few unimportant rights. Often in a church that has several priests (as we should say a rector and curates) the first (rector) is called protopope. In imperial Russia, royal Bulgaria, royal Rumania and Habsburg Austria the protopopes had authority over a district containing several parishes which they had to visit occasionally, representing for the clergy the court of first instance. In Orthodox Hungary and Transylvania there are protopresbyterates (eparchies), in which the protopope is elected by clergy and people and rules under the bishop. In these cases he may be compared to our rural deans. Such an office is the highest to which a married Orthodox priest may aspire, since bishops are always monks. In Russia the protopope (protoierei) sometimes wears the Byzantine [[mitre]] (but without a cross atop it) and [[epigonation]], but not the [[omophorion]] or [[sakkos]].

'''Religion in South Korea''' is characterized by the fact that a majority of South Koreans (56.1%) as of the 2015 national census) have [[Irreligion in South Korea|no formal affiliation with a religion]]. Among those who are members of a religious organisation, [[Protestantism]] represents (19.7%) of the total population, [[Buddhism]] (15.5%), and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] (7.9%). A small percentage of South Koreans (0.8% in total) are members of other religions, including [[Won Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Cheondoism]], [[Daesun Jinrihoe]], [[Daejongism]], [[Jeungsanism]], and [[Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Buddhism was influential in ancient times and Christianity had influenced large segments of the population in the 18th and 19th century, yet they grew rapidly in membership only by the mid-20th century, as part of the profound transformations that South Korean society went through in the past century.&lt;ref name="Pyong Gap Min, 2014"&gt;Pyong Gap Min, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;But it have shown some decline from the year 2000 onwards. Native shamanic religions (i.e. ''[[Korean shamanism|Sindo]]'') remain popular and could represent a large part of the unaffiliated. Indeed, according to a 2012 survey, only 15% of the population declared to be not religious in the sense of "[[atheism]]".&lt;ref&gt;WIN-Gallup International: [http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf "Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism 2012"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |date=21 October 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2015 census, the proportion of the unaffiliated is higher among the youth, about 65% among the 20-years old.&lt;ref name="Kim-Shon-Chosunilbo2016"&gt;Kim Han-soo, Shon Jin-seok. [http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/12/20/2016122000155.html 신자 수, 개신교 1위… "종교 없다" 56%]. ''The Chosunilbo'', 20/12/2016. Retrieved 02/07/2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea entered the 20th century with an already ingrained Christian presence and a vast majority of the population practicing native religion (Sindo). The latter never gained the high status of a national religious culture comparable to [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Shinto|Japan's Shinto]]; this weakness of Korean Sindo was among the reasons that left a free hand to an early and thorough rooting of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Ogata, Mamoru Billy 1984 p. 32"&gt;Ogata, Mamoru Billy (1984). ''A Comparative Study of Church Growth in Korea and Japan: With Special Application to Japan''. Fuller Theological Seminary. p. 32 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The population also took part in Confucianising rites and held private [[jesa|ancestor worship]].&lt;ref name="Pyong Gap Min, 2014"/&gt; Organised religions and philosophies belonged to the ruling elites, and the long patronage exerted by the Chinese empire led these elites to embrace a particularly strict Confucianism (i.e. [[Korean Confucianism]]). [[Korean Buddhism]], despite an erstwhile rich tradition, at the dawn of the 20th century was virtually extinct as a religious institution, after 500 years of suppression under the [[Joseon]] kingdom.&lt;ref name="Pyong Gap Min, 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 15"&gt;Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity had antecedents in the Korean peninsula as early as the 18th century, when the philosophical school of ''[[Seohak]]'' supported the religion. With the fall of the Joseon in the last decades of the 19th century, Koreans largely embraced Christianity, since the monarchy itself and the intellectuals looked to Western models to modernise the country and endorsed the work of Catholic and Protestant missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, 2002. pp. 155-187&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonisation]] in the first half of the 20th century, the identification of Christianity with [[Korean nationalism]] was further strengthened,&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 158-161"&gt;Grayson, 2002. pp. 158-161&lt;/ref&gt; as the Japanese tried to merge native Sindo with their [[Shinto in Korea|State Shinto]].

With the [[division of Korea]] into two states after 1945, the communist north and the anti-communist south, the majority of the Korean Christian population that had been until then in the northern half of the peninsula,&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158, p. 162"&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 158, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; fled to South Korea.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 163"&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that Christians who migrated to the south were more than one million.&lt;ref&gt;Lankov, Andrei. ''The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia''. Oxford University Press, 2014. {{ISBN|0199390037}}. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the second half of the 20th century, the South Korean state enacted [[misin tapa undong|measures to further marginalise indigenous Sindo]], at the same time strengthening Christianity and a revival of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, 2010. pp. 4-17&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholars, South Korean censuses do not count believers in indigenous Sindo and underestimate the number of adherents of [[Korean shamanism#Branching|Sindo sects]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 2008. pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, statistics compiled by the ARDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/|title=Quality Data on Religion|work=The Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimate that as of 2010, 14.7% of South Koreans practice ethnic religion, 14.2% adhere to new movements, and 10.9% practice Confucianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_124_2.asp|title=The Republic of South Korea: Religious Adherents, 2010 (World Christian Database)|work=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some observers, the sharp decline of some religions (Catholicism and Buddhism) recorded between the censuses of 2005 and 2015 is due to the change in survey methodology between the two censuses. While the 2005 census was an analysis of the entire population ("whole survey") through traditional data sheets compiled by every family, the 2015 census was largely conducted through the [[internet]] and was limited to a sample of about 20% of the South Korean population. It has been argued that the 2015 census penalised the rural population, which is more Buddhist and Catholic and less familiar with the internet, while advantaging the Protestant population, which is more urban and has easier access to the internet. Both the Buddhist and the Catholic communities criticised the 2015 census' results.&lt;ref name=Kim-Shon-Chosunilbo2016/&gt;

==History==

===Before 1945===
{{see also|Religion in North Korea#Ancient Korea}}
Prior to the introduction of Buddhism, all Koreans believed in their indigenous religion socially guided by ''mu'' (shamans). Buddhism was introduced from the Chinese Former Qin state in 372 to the northern Korean state of Goguryeo and developed into distinctive Korean forms. At that time, the peninsula was divided into [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|three kingdoms]]: the aforementioned Goguryeo in the north, [[Baekje]] in the southwest, and [[Silla]] in the southeast. Buddhism reached Silla only in the 5th century, but it was made the state religion only in that kingdom in the year 552.&lt;ref name="Korea, 300 to 600 CE"&gt;Asia For Educators: ''[http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/tps/300ce_ko.htm#buddhism Korea, 300 to 600 CE]''. Columbia University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism became much more popular in Silla and even in Baekje (both areas now part of modern South Korea), while in Goguryeo the Korean indigenous religion remained dominant. In the following unified state of Goryeo (918–1392) Buddhism flourished, and even became a political force.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeersch, Sem. (2008). ''The Power of the Buddhas: the Politics of Buddhism during the Koryŏ Dynasty (918-1392)''. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joseon kingdom (1392–1910), adopted an especially strict version of [[Neo-Confucianism]] (i.e. [[Korean Confucianism]]) and suppressed and marginalised Korean Buddhism&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 120-138"&gt;Grayson, 2002. pp. 120-138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tudor, 2012"&gt;Tudor, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and Korean shamanism.&lt;ref name="Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 15"/&gt; Buddhist monasteries were destroyed, and their number dropped from several hundreds to a mere thirty-six; Buddhism was eradicated from the life of towns as monks and nuns were prohibited from entering them and were marginalised to the mountains.&lt;ref name="Tudor, 2012"/&gt; These restrictions lasted until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, the Joseon state was politically and culturally collapsing.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 155"&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The intelligentsia was looking for solutions to invigorate and transform the nation.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 155"/&gt; It was in this critical period that they came into contact with Western Christian missionaries who offered a solution to the plight of Koreans.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 155"/&gt; Christian communities already existed in Joseon since the 17th century, however it was only by the 1880s that the government allowed a large number of Western missionaries to enter the country.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Christian missionaries set up schools, hospitals and publishing agencies.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 157-158"&gt;Grayson, 2002. pp. 157-158&lt;/ref&gt; The royal family supported Christianity.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158"&gt;Grayson, 2002. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|absorption of Korea into the Japanese Empire]] (1910–1945) the already formed link of Christianity with [[Korean nationalism]] was strengthened,&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 158-161"/&gt; as the Japanese tried to impose [[State Shinto]], co-opting within it native Korean Sindo, and Christians refused to take part in Shinto rituals.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 158-161"/&gt; At the same time, numerous religious movements that since the 19th century had been trying to reform the Korean indigenous religion, notably [[Cheondoism]], flourished.&lt;ref name="Carl Young 2013. pp. 51-66"&gt;Carl Young. ''Into the Sunset: Ch’ŏndogyo in North Korea, 1945–1950''. On: ''Journal of Korean Religions'', Volume 4, Number 2, October 2013. pp. 51-66 / 10.1353/jkr.2013.0010&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945—present===
[[File:Mudang performing a ritual placating the angry spirits of the dead.jpg|thumb|150px|A ''mudang'' holding a ''gut'' to placate the angry spirits of the dead.]]
With the [[division of Korea]] into two states in 1945, the [[history of North Korea|communist north]] and the [[history of South Korea|anti-communist south]], the majority of the Korean Christian population that had been until then in the northern half of the peninsula,&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158, p. 162"/&gt; fled to South Korea.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 163"/&gt; Christians who resettled in the south were more than one million. Cheondoists, who were concentrated in the north like Christians, remained there after the partition,&lt;ref name="Carl Young 2013. pp. 51-66"/&gt; and South Korea now has no more than few thousands Cheondoists.

The so-called "[[misin tapa undong|movement to defeat the worship of gods]]" promoted by governments of South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, prohibited indigenous cults and wiped out nearly all traditional shrines (''sadang'' 사당) of the Confucian kinship religion.&lt;ref name="Kendall, 2010. p. 10"&gt;Kendall, 2010. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; This was particularly tough under the rule of [[Park Chung-hee]] (a Buddhist).&lt;ref name="Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 17"&gt;Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure, combined with the rapid social changes of the same period,&lt;ref name="Pyong Gap Min, 2014"/&gt; favoured a rapid revival of Korean Buddhism and growth of Christian churches in a trend to register as members of organised religions.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 2008. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Buddhist temples rose from 2,306 in 1962 to 11,561 in 1997, Protestant churches rose from 6,785 in 1962 to 58,046 in 1997, the Catholic Church had 313 churches in 1965 and 1,366 in 2005, [[Won Buddhism]] had 131 temples in 1969 and 418 in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 2008. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Daesun Jinrihoe]]'s  temples have grown from 700 in 1983 to 1,600 in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 2003. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics from censuses show that the proportion of the South Korean population self-identifying as Buddhist has grown from 2.6% in 1962 to 22.8% in 2005,&lt;ref name="Pyong Gap Min, 2014"/&gt; while the proportion of Christians has grown from 5% in 1962 to 29.2% in 2005.&lt;ref name="Pyong Gap Min, 2014"/&gt; However, both religions have shown a decline between the years 2005 and 2015, with Buddhism sharply declining in influence to 15.5% of the population, and a less significant decline of Christianity to 27.6%.&lt;ref name="2015 Census"/&gt;

===Protestant attacks on traditional religions and protest against forced conversions===
Since the 1980s and the 1990s there have been acts of hostility committed by Protestants against Buddhists and followers of traditional religions in South Korea. This include the arson of temples, the beheading of statues of Buddha and bodhisattvas, and red Christian crosses painted on either statues or other Buddhist and other religions' properties.&lt;ref name="Buswell, Lee. 2007. p. 375"&gt;Buswell, Lee. 2007. p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these acts have even been promoted by churches' [[pastor]]s.&lt;ref name="Buswell, Lee. 2007. p. 375"/&gt;

In 2018, a mass protest broke out in support of [[freedom of religion]] and against the government's inaction on widespread programs of violent forced conversion carried out by Christian churches under the guide of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK), just after a woman named Ji-In Gu, one among approximately a thousand victims of the churches, was kidnapped and killed while being forced to convert. Before being killed, Ji-In Gu dedicated herself in exposing the conversion treatments, and for such reason she had become a target of the Christian churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Korean Citizens Protest Against Government Inaction on Human Rights Violation|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/south-korean-citizens-protest-against-government-inaction-on-human-rights-violation-300611104.html|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Cheon-Ji News, PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=120,000 South Koreans Rally for Punishment of Pastors for Forced Conversion|url=https://thevoicebw.com/120000-south-koreans-rally-punishment-pastors-forced-conversion/|date=13 February 2018|publisher=The Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Christianity in Korea}}
Christianity (그리스도교 ''Geurisdogyo'' or 기독교 ''Gidoggyo'') in South Korea is predominantly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] (천주교 ''Cheonjugyo'', "religion of the Lord of Heaven", or 가톨릭 교회 ''Gatollik gyohoe'') and [[Protestant]] (열교 ''Yeolgyo'', "religion of split", or 개신교 ''Gaesingyo'', "religion of the innovators"), respectively with 3.8 million and 9.6 million members as of the 2015 census. There are also small communities of [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] (정교회 ''Jeonggyohoe'', "authentic church") under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodoxy]] (콥트 정교회 ''Kopteu Jeonggyohoe'').

Foreign Roman Catholic missionaries did not arrive in Korea until 1794, a decade after the return of [[Yi Sung-hun]], a diplomat who was the first baptised Korean in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Choi Suk-woo. ''Korean Catholicism Yesterday and Today''. On: ''Korean Journal'' XXIV, 8, August 1984. pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; He established a grass roots lay Catholic movement in Korea. However, the writings of the Jesuit missionary [[Matteo Ricci]], who was resident at the imperial court in Beijing, had been already brought to Korea from China in the 17th century. Scholars of the ''[[Silhak]]'' ("Practical Learning") were attracted to Catholic doctrines, and this was a key factor for the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Han-sik. ''The Influence of Christianity''. In: ''Korean Journal'' XXIII, 12, December 1983. pp. 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; The penetration of Western ideas and Christianity in Korea became known as ''[[Seohak]]'' ("Western Learning"). A study of 1801 found that more than half of the families that had converted to Catholicism were linked to the Seohak school.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Ok-hy. ''Women in the History of Catholicism in Korea''. In: ''Korean Journal'' XXIV, 8, August 1984. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Largely because converts refused to perform Confucian ancestral rituals, the Joseon government prohibited Christian proselytising. Some Catholics were executed during the early 19th century, but the restrictive law was not strictly enforced.

Protestant missionaries entered Korea during the 1880s and, along with Catholic priests, converted a remarkable number of Koreans, this time with the support of the royal government which winked at Westernising forces in a period of deep internal crisis (due to the waning of centuries-long patronage from a then-weakened China).&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158"/&gt; The lack of a national religious system compared to [[Chinese folk religion|those of China]] and [[Shinto|that of Japan]] (Korean [[Korean shamanism|Sindo]] never developed to a high status of institutional and civic religion) gave a free hand to Christian churches.&lt;ref name="Ogata, Mamoru Billy 1984 p. 32"/&gt; [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] missionaries were especially successful. They established schools, universities, hospitals, and orphanages and played a significant role in the modernisation of the country.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 157-158"/&gt; 

Many Koreans began to migrate to Russia in the 1860s and many of them subsequently converted to Eastern Orthodox Church. Orthodox missionaries entered Korea from Russia in 1900. In 1903, the first Orthodox Church in Korea was established. However, the [[Russo-Japanese war]] in 1904 and the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1918 interrupted the activities of the mission.

During the Japanese colonial occupation, Christians were in the front ranks of the struggle for independence. Factors contributing to the growth of Catholicism and Protestantism included the decayed state of Korean Buddhism, the support of the intellectual elite, and the encouragement of self-support and self-government among members of the Korean church, and finally the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158"/&gt;

A large number of Christians lived in the northern part of the peninsula (it was part of the so-called "[[Manchurian revival]]")&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158"/&gt; where Confucian influence was not as strong as in the south.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 158, p. 162"/&gt; Before 1948 [[Pyongyang]] was an important Christian centre: one-sixth of its population of about 300,000 people were converts. Following the establishment of the communist regime in the north, an estimated more than one million Korean Christians resettled to South Korea to escape persecution by North Korea's anti-Christian policies.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. p. 163"/&gt; And at that time, the small Orthodox community of Korea received support from South Koreans ally Greece. So, Korean Orthodox faithful requested to come under the spiritual care of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1955 and the Ecumenical Patriarchate took the Korean Orthodox Church under its protection in 1956.

Christianity grew significantly in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s it continued to grow, but at a slower rate, and since the 2000s it has shown some decline. Christianity is especially dominant in the west of the country including [[Seoul]], [[Incheon]], and the regions of [[Gyeonggi Province|Gyeonggi]] and [[Honam]]. The Christian faith in South Korea is dominated by four denominations: Catholicism, Presbyterianism (장로교 pronounced ''Jangnogyo''), Methodism (감리교 pronounced ''Gamnigyo'') and [[Baptists]] (침례교 pronounced ''Chimnyegyo''). The [[Yoido Full Gospel Church]] is the largest [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] church in the country. Some [[non-denominational]] churches also exist. Korean Catholics still observe ''[[jesa]]'' (ancestral rites); the Korean tradition is very different from the institutional religious ancestral worship that is found [[ancestor veneration in China|in China]] and Japan and can be easily integrated as ancillary to Christianity. Orthodox and Protestants, by contrast, have completely abandoned the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwon|first=Okyun|title=Buddhist and protestant Korean immigrants: religious beliefs and socioeconomic aspects of life|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing LLC|year=2003|pages=137–138|isbn=978-1-931202-65-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[peace churches]] have not gained a strong foothold on the peninsula. [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] thought briefly attracted a national following in the late 20th century, thanks to the leadership of [[Ham Seok-heon]]. However, after Ham's death, interest in Quakerism declined. The state of [[Unitarianism]] is similar.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Korea]] was established following the baptism of [[Kim Ho Jik]] in 1951. Studying nutrition in Cornell, he met a member of their faith, Oliver Wyman, and was struck with their doctrine. Upon joining the church and completing his degree, Kim travelled back to South Korea, started translations for materials, and helped the church gain official recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/07/kim-ho-jik-korean-pioneer?lang=eng|title=Kim Ho Jik: Korean Pioneer|publisher=The Ensign|date=July 1988|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012 there were 81,628 Mormons and one temple in Seoul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/church/temples/seoul-korea?lang=eng |title=Seoul Korea |publisher=Lds.org |date=21 February 2012|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; four missions (Seoul, Daejeon, Busan, and Seoul South),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765623191/LDS-Church-announces-creation-of-58-new-missions.html?pg=all|title=LDS Church announces creation of 58 new missions|publisher=Deseret News|date=22 February 2013|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 128 congregations, and twenty-four family history centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/south-korea/|title=Facts and Statistics, South Korea |publisher=LDS Newsroom|date=31 December 2012|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism (불교 ''Bulgyo'') entered Korea from China during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|period of the three kingdoms]] (372, or the 4th century).&lt;ref name="Korea, 300 to 600 CE"/&gt; Buddhism was the dominant religious and cultural influence in the [[Silla]] (668-935) and subsequent Goryeo (918-1392) states. Confucianism was also brought to Korea from China in early centuries, and was formulated as [[Korean Confucianism]] in Goryeo. However, it was only in the subsequent Joseon kingdom (1392–1910) that Korean Confucianism was established as the state ideology and religion, and Korean Buddhism underwent 500 years of suppression.&lt;ref name="Grayson, 2002. pp. 120-138"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tudor, 2012"/&gt; Buddhism in the contemporary state of South Korea is stronger in the east of the country, namely the [[Yeongnam]] and [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon]] regions, as well as in [[Jeju Province|Jeju]].

There are a number of different schools in Korean Buddhism (대한불교 ''Daehanbulgyo''), including the ''[[Korean Seon|Seon]]'' (Korean Zen). The overwhelming majority of Buddhist temples in contemporary South Korea belong to the dominant [[Jogye Order]], traditionally related to the Seon school. The order's headquarters are at [[Jogyesa]] in central [[Seoul]], and it operates most of the country's old and famous temples, such as [[Bulguksa]] and [[Beomeosa]].

Other Buddhist traditions in South Korea include the "[[Taego]]" and "[[Cheontae]]" lineages. Taego is a form of Seon (Zen), while the Choentae is a modern revival of the [[Tiantai]] lineage in Korea, focusing on the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]''. Another lineage, the [[Jingak Order]], is a form of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. Both the Jogye and Cheontae orders require their monastics to be celibate, while the Taego and Jingak orders allow for married priests.

====Won Buddhism====
Won Buddhism (원불교 ''Wonbulgyo'') is a modern reformed Buddhism that seeks to make enlightenment possible for everyone and applicable to regular life. The scriptures and practices are simplified so that anyone, regardless of their wealth, occupation, or other external living conditions, can understand them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Won Buddhism as a Korean New Religion|journal=Numen|first= Michael|last=Pye|volume=49|issue=2|pages=113–141|jstor=3270479|doi=10.1163/156852702760186745|subscription=true|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Korean language the shaman-priest or ''[[mu (shaman)|mu]]'' ({{hanja|巫}}) is known as a ''mudang'' ({{hangul|무당}} {{hanja|巫堂}}) if female or ''baksu'' if male, although other names and locutions are used.&lt;ref name=JYL4 /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Another term is ''dangol'' ({{hangul|당골}}). The word ''mudang'' is mostly associated, though not exclusively, to female shamans due to their prevalence in the Korean tradition in recent centuries. This has brought to the development of other locutions for male shamans, including ''sana mudang'' (literally "male ''mudang''") in the Seoul area or ''baksu mudang'' ("healer ''mudang''"), shortened ''baksu'', in the Pyongyang area. It is reasonable to believe that the word ''baksu'' is an ancient authentic designation for male shamans.&lt;ref name="Lee 3-4"&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;}} Korean ''mu'' "shaman" is synonymous with [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'', which defines priests both male and female.&lt;ref name=JYL5 /&gt; The role of the ''mudang'' is to act as intermediary between the [[spirit]]s or [[gods]], and the human plain, through ''[[gut (ritual)|gut]]'' (rituals), seeking to resolve problems in the patterns of development of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Central is interaction with ''Haneullim'' or ''Hwanin'', meaning "source of all being",&lt;ref name=JYL18&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and of all gods of nature,&lt;ref name=JYL5 /&gt; the utmost god or the supreme mind.&lt;ref name=JYL17&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The ''mu'' are mythically described as descendants of the "Heavenly King", son of the "Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]", with investiture often passed down through female princely lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. pp. 5-12&lt;/ref&gt; However, other myths link the heritage of the traditional faith to Dangun, male son of the Heavenly King and initiator of the Korean nation.&lt;ref name=JYL13&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Japanese [[Shinto]], Korean religion has also similarities with Chinese [[Chinese shamanism|Wuism]],&lt;ref name=JYL21&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and is akin to the Siberian, Mongolian, and Manchurian religious traditions.&lt;ref name=JYL21 /&gt; Some studies trace the Korean ancestral god Dangun to the Ural-Altaic Tengri "Heaven", the shaman and the prince.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, p. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JYL 17-18"&gt;Jung Young Lee, 1981. pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialects of some provinces of Korea the shaman is called ''dangul dangul-ari''.&lt;ref name=JYL18 /&gt; The ''mudang'' is similar to the Japanese ''miko'' and the Ryukyuan ''yuta''. Muism has exerted an influence on some Korean new religions, such as [[Cheondoism]] and [[Jeungsanism]]. According to various sociological studies, Korea's type of Christianity owes much of its success to native shamanism, which provided a congenial mindset and models for the religion to take root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|author=Andrew E.

In the 1890s, the last decades of the Joseon kingdom, Protestant missionaries gained significant influence, and led a demonisation of native religion through the press, and even carried out campaigns of physical suppression of local cults.&lt;ref name="Kendall, 2010. pp. 4-7"&gt;Kendall, 2010. pp. 4-7&lt;/ref&gt; The Protestant discourse would have had an influence on all further attempts to uproot native religion.&lt;ref name="Kendall, 2010. pp. 4-7"/&gt; The "movement to destroy Sindo" carried out in South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, destroyed much of the physical heritage of Korean religion (temples and shrines),&lt;ref name="Kendall, 2010. p. 10"/&gt; especially during the regime of President [[Park Chung-hee]].&lt;ref name="Joon-sik Choi, 2006. p. 17"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2244&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2243&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list&lt;/ref&gt; There has been of a revival of shamanism in South Korea in most recent times.&lt;ref&gt;Joon-sik Choi, 2006. pp. 17-18-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sang-Hun|first=Choe|title=In the age of the Internet, Korean shamans regain popularity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/06/world/asia/06iht-shaman.1.6527738.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|newspaper=New York Times|date=6 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheondoism===
{{Main|Cheondoism}}
Cheondoism (천도교 ''Cheondogyo'') is a fundamentally Confucian religious tradition derived from indigenous Sinism. It is the religious dimension of the ''[[Donghak]]'' ("Eastern Learning") movement that was founded by [[Choe Je-u]] (1824-1864), a member of an impoverished [[yangban]] (aristocratic) family,&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 1996. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; in 1860 as a counter-force to the rise of "foreign religions",&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 105"&gt;Lee, 1996. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; which in his view included Buddhism and Christianity (part of ''[[Seohak]]'', the wave of Western influence that penetrated Korean life at the end of the 19th century).&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 105" /&gt; Choe Je-u founded Cheondoism after having been allegedly healed from illness by an experience of ''Sangje'' or ''[[Haneullim]]'', the god of the universal Heaven in traditional shamanism.&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 105" /&gt;

The Donghak movement became so influential among common people that in 1864 the Joseon government sentenced Choe Je-u to death.&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 105"/&gt; The movement grew and in 1894 the members gave rise to the Donghak Peasant Revolution against the royal government. With the division of Korea in 1945, most of the Cheondoist community remained in the north, where the majority of them dwelled.&lt;ref name="Carl Young 2013. pp. 51-66"/&gt; Only few thousands of them remain in South Korea today.

The social and historical significance of the Donghak movement and Cheondoism has been largely ignored in South Korea,&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 110"&gt;Lee, 1996. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; contrarywise to [[North Korea]] where Cheondoism is viewed positively as a folk (''[[minjung]]'') movement.&lt;ref name="Lee, 1996. p. 110"/&gt;

===Other sects===
Apart from Cheondoism, other sects based on indigenous religion were founded between the end of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. They include [[Daejongism]] (대종교 ''Daejonggyo''),&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 2008. p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; which has as its central creed the worship of Dangun, legendary founder of [[Gojoseon]], thought of as the first proto-Korean kingdom; and a splinter sect of Cheondoism: [[Suwunism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Jeungsanism]] (증산교 ''Jeungsangyo'') defines a family of religions founded in the early 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 2008. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; that emphasise magical practices and [[millenarianism|millenarian]] teachings. Part of it are more than a hundred "Jeungsan religions," including the now defunct [[Bocheonism]]: the largest in Korea is currently [[Daesun Jinrihoe]] (대순진리회), an offshoot of the still existing Taegeukdo (태극도), while [[Jeungsando]] (증산도) is the  most active overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 2008, p. 986; Introvigne, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They show themes derived from Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Korean folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of small religious sects, which have sprung up around [[Gyeryongsan]] ("Rooster-Dragon Mountain", always one of Korea's most-sacred areas) in [[South Chungcheong Province]], the supposed future site of the founding of a new dynasty originally prophesied in the 18th century (or before). Japanese [[Tenriism]] (천리교 ''Cheonligyo'') also claims to have thousands of South Korean members.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 2008. p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Andrew Eungi Kim, there was a rise of new religious movements in the late 1900s which account for about 10 percent of all churches in South Korea. According to Kim, this is the outcome of foreign invasions, as well as conflicting views regarding social and political issues. Many of the new religious movements are [[Religious syncretism|syncretic]] in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Characteristics of Religious Life in South Korea: A Sociological Survey|jstor=3512000|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume= 43|issue=4|pages=291|last1=Kim|first1=Andrew Eungi|doi=10.2307/3512000|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unification Church===
{{main article|Unification Church}}
The Unification Church or Unificationism (통일교 ''Tongilgyo'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unificationism: A New Philosophy and Worldview|last=Matczak|first=Sebastian|publisher=New York Learned Publications|year=1982|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[new religious movement]] founded in South Korea in 1954 by [[Sun Myung Moon]]. Since its founding, the church has expanded throughout the world with most members living in East Asia.

Unificationist beliefs are derived from the Christian Bible and are explained in the church's textbook, the ''[[Divine Principle]]''. It teaches that God is the creator and Heavenly Father, whose [[Duotheism|dual nature]] combines both masculinity and femininity and whose centre is true love.

The Unification Church has sponsored many organizations and projects over the years; including businesses, news media, projects in education and the arts, and political and social activism. The church was led by Moon until his death on September 3, 2012. At the time of Moon's death, it was reported that his widow [[Hak Ja Han]] would assume the leadership of the church. Their philosophy for establishing the Kingdom of Heaven is family centred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=True Families: Gateway To Heaven|last=Moon|first=Sun Myung|publisher=HSA-UWC|year=2013|isbn=978-1-931166-31-7|location=4 West 43rd Street New York, NY|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Korean Unification Church members started a political party in South Korea. It was named "The Party for God, Peace, Unification, and Home". In an inauguration declaration, the new party said it would focus on preparing for the reunification of the South and North Korea by educating the public about God and peace. A church official said that similar political parties would be started in Japan and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/moonies-launch-political-party-in-s-korea-1.101978|title='Moonies' launch political party in S Korea|date=10 March 2003|accessdate=28 January 2016|publisher=iol.co.za|agency=Sapa-AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Korean new religions that originated within Christianity are the [[World Mission Society Church of God]] and the [[Victory Altar]].

===Confucianism===
{{Main|Korean Confucianism}}Only few contemporary South Koreans identify as adherents of Confucianism (유교 ''Yugyo''). Korean intellectuals historically developed a distinct [[Korean Confucianism]]. However, with the end of the Joseon state and the wane of Chinese influence in the 19th and 20th century, Confucianism was abandoned. The influence of Confucian ethical thought remains strong in other religious practices, and in [[Korean culture]] in general. Confucian rituals are still practised at various times of the year. The most prominent of these are the annual rites held at the Shrine of Confucius in Seoul. Other rites, for instance those in honour of clan founders, are held at shrines found throughout the country.

===Hinduism===
{{Main article|Hinduism in Korea}}
Hinduism (힌두교 ''Hindugyo'') is practiced among South Korea's small [[India]]n and [[Nepal]]i immigrant community. However, Hindu traditions such as [[yoga]] and [[Vedanta]] have attracted interest among younger South Koreans. There are two Hindu temples in the Seoul region, the [[Sri Radha Shyamasundar Mandir]] and the [[Sri Sri Radha Krishna temple]], located on Seoul's outskirts.

===Islam===
[[File:Seoul central mosque 01.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Minaret]]s of the Seoul Central Mosque.]]
{{Main article|Islam in Korea}}
Islam (이슬람교 ''Iseullamgyo'') in South Korea is represented by a community of roughly 40,000 [[Muslim]]s, mainly composed by people who converted during the [[Korean War]] and their descendants and not including migrant workers from South and Southeast Asia. The largest mosque is the [[Seoul Central Mosque]] in the [[Itaewon]] district of Seoul; smaller mosques can be found in most of the country's major cities.

In addition to native Korean Muslims, there are around a hundred thousand foreign workers from Muslim countries, particularly Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korea's Muslims Mark Ramadan|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=11 September 2008|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200809/200809110016.html|accessdate=9 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913195801/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200809/200809110016.html|archivedate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Main article|History of the Jews in South Korea}}
The Jewish existence in South Korea effectively began with the dawn of the Korean War in 1950.  At this time a large number of Jewish soldiers, including the chaplain [[Chaim Potok]], came to the Korean peninsula. Today the Jewish community is very small and limited to the [[Seoul Capital Area]]. There have been very few Korean converts to Judaism (유태교 ''Yutaegyo'').

=== Shinto ===
[[File:Keijyo shrine 11.jpeg|thumb|150px|
Keijyo Shinto Shrine, prior to 1935, [[Seoul]].
]]
{{Main|Shinto in Korea}}
During Japan's colonisation of Korea (1910-1945), given the common [[Altaic peoples|Altaic]] origins of the two peoples, Koreans were considered to be outright part of the Japanese population, to be wholly assimilated. The Japanese studied and coopted native ''[[Korean shamanism|Sindo]]'' by overlapping it with their [[State Shinto]] (similar measures of assimilation were applied to Buddhism), which hinged upon the worship of Japanese high gods and the emperor's godhead. Hundreds of Japanese [[Shinto shrines]] were built throughout the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Yi, Yong-sik (2010). ''Shaman Ritual Music in Korea''. University of Minnesota. {{ISBN|1931897107}}. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

This policy led to massive conversion of Koreans to Christian churches, which were already well ingrained in the country, representing a concern for the Japanese program, and supported Koreans' independence.&lt;ref&gt;''Korean Social Sciences Journal'', '''24''' (1997). Korean Social Science Research Council. pp. 33-53&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diocese of Urgell''' is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]] in [[Spain]] and [[Andorra]] in the historical [[County of Urgell]],&lt;ref name=CathHierUrgell&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/durge.html "Diocese of Urgell"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''. David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCathUrgell&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/urge0.htm "Diocese of Urgell"] ''GCatholic.org''. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; with origins in the fifth century [[AD]] or possibly earlier. It is based in the region of the historical [[Catalan counties|Catalan]] [[County of Urgell]], though it has different borders.  The seat and [[Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell|Cathedral]] of the bishop are situated in [[la Seu d'Urgell]] town. The state of Andorra is a part of this diocese.

Among its most notable events are [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Bishop Felix's]] adoptionist revolt, the coup of Bishop Esclua and the overthrowing of the bishop by members of aristocratic families (namely Salla i Ermengol del Conflent, Eribau i Folcs dels Cardona, Guillem Guifré de Cerdanya and Ot de Pallars) between the years 981 and 1122.

Also important is the diocese's patronage of [[Andorra]], with the bishop holding the role of ''ex officio'' [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince]] of the Pyrenean Catalan-speaking nation jointly with the [[President of France|President]] of the [[French Republic]] (and formerly, the King of France). [[Andorra]] was ceded to the [[Bishop of Urgell]] by the [[Ermengol VI, Count of Urgell|Count Ermengol VI of Urgell]] in 1133.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bueno Salinas
 |first=Santiago |last2=Pérez-Madrid |first2=Francisca |title=Religion and the Secular State in Andorra |url=http://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Andorra.2.pdf |publisher=International Center for Law and Religion Studies|pages=58|access-date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 1802, the ecclesiastical border corresponded with the royal one established under the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659. As such the 33 towns of the northern [[Cerdanya]] (now in France) came under the diocese's control.

==Description of the diocesan territory==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] controls the [[Archdiocese of Tarragona|metropolitan church]] of [[Tarragona]], with its [[Episcopal see|see]] or capital of the Seu d’Urgell (Urgell See). It contains 7630 km² and a population of 200,761 according to the 2000 [[census]] and is the largest bishopric of the eight that have a see in Catalonia. In contrast, it is the most sparsely populated. The diocese borders the bishoprics of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic|Vic]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Solsona|Solsona]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lleida|Lleida]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Barbastro-Monzón|Barbastro-Monzón]] , [[Toulouse]], [[Pamiers]] and [[Perpignan]]. It has been deeply linked for many years to the regions that constituted the counties of [[Urgell]], [[County of Pallars|Pallars]] and [[Cerdanya]] during the [[Middle Ages]], with which it identifies and forms a historical and geographic unit maintained up to the present day. The diocese totally or partially occupies the [[Ripollès]], [[Cerdanya]], [[Alt Urgell]], [[Segarra]], Urgell, [[Pla d'Urgell]], [[Noguera (comarca)|Noguera]], [[Pallars Jussà]], [[Pallars Sobirà]], [[Alta Ribagorça]] and the [[Vall d'Aran]] regions.

The bishopric’s jurisdiction extends to 408 parishes, although today some have a very reduced population. Almost all of the parishes come from distant times, as the very [[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|titular]] saints of their churches. The most common are [[Saint Mary]] (in 90 parochial churches, as well as the [[cathedral]]), [[Saint Peter]] (35), [[Martin of Braga|Saint Martin]] (29), [[Perpetua and Felicity|Saint Saturninus]] (24), [[Saint Steven]] (23), [[Saint Michael]] (19), [[Saint Andrew]] (17), [[Julian of Toledo|Saint Julian]] (12), [[Saint Eulalia of Barcelona|Saint Eulalia]] (11), [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent]] and [[Felix of Girona|Saint Felix]] (10). Many churches of the [[Diocese|bishopric]], parochial or not, conserve elements of great architectural interest, and thirty-six of them are considered cultural goods of [[national interest]] in [[Spain]].

Amongst all Catalan bishoprics, the Diocese of Urgell has been that which has experienced the most border-related changes throughout its existence, mainly for political reasons: the loss of [[Alta Ribagorça|Ribagorça]] (9th century), to the benefit of the [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses of Spain|Diocese of Roda]], and the cession of 144 parishes of the [[Berguedà]], the [[Solsonès]] and a part of the Segarra, to the benefit of the new diocese of Solsona (1593-1623); later, it was necessary to adapt the territory to the borders between states, and thus in 1803, the 24 parishes of [[French Cerdagne]], which had been ceded to France from the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, also passed ecclesiastically to that country; and in 1804, the 28 from the [[Aran Valley]], a territory circumscribed by [[France]] yet united fully to the Catalan-Aragonese territories at least since the 12th century, were annexed to the diocese of Urgell, coming from the eliminated [[Gascony|Gascon]] diocese of [[Sant Bertran de Comenge]]. In 1874 the sixty-odd towns that formed the erstwhile exempt jurisdictions of [[Gerri]], [[Mur, Switzerland|Mur]], [[Montodó-Bonrepòs]], the order of [[Saint John of Jerusalem]] and [[Meià]] were annexed to the diocese. Finally, in 1956, the diocese gained the seven parishes of the [[Artesa de Segre]] enclave and gave up the 19 of the [[Franja de Ponent]] [Western Strip] to [[Lleida]] and [[Barbastre]], grouped into three enclaves.

==Origin of the Urgell diocese==

The diocese, without excluding the possibility of a more remote origin, was already constituted at the beginning of the 6th century. The first known bishop, [[Justus of Urgell|Saint Justus]], figures among the participants of the councils of [[Councils of Toledo|Toledo]] (531), [[Lleida]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] (546). His successors also took part regularly in the Toledo councils celebrated throughout the 7th century. The Episcopal succession, despite the uncertainty of names and chronology, seems to not be interrupted by the [[Saracen]] invasion of 714.

[[Monasticism]] must have been introduced into the diocese during the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] period. The monasteries of [[Tavèrnoles]], [[Gerri]], [[Codinet]], and [[Tresponts]] are probably anterior to the Saracen invasion. These foundations and the later ones--[[la Vedella]], [[Elins]], [[Bagà]], [[la Portella]], [[les Maleses]], [[Villanega]], [[Oveix]], [[Bellera]], [[el Burgal]], [[Lavaix]], [[Alaó]], [[Escales]], [[Ovarra]], [[Taverna]], [[Gualter]], etc.—often adopted the Benedictine observance from the 9th century on, following the example of the majority of the coenobitic monasteries then extant in the [[Marca Hispanica]]. This became the norm for monastic life in the following century. These monasteries, alongside the parochial and canonical organization (the Urgell Diocese, [[Solsona, Lleida|Solsona]], [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Organyà]], [[Ponts, Lleida|Ponts]], [[Àger|Ager]], [[Mur, Switzerland|Mur]], [[Tremp]]) would greatly influence the Christianization of the country and its human, cultural and economic development.

The [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] monasteries derived into colleges as a result of their [[secularization]] (1592), and due to their corruption, the 1851 concord eliminated them, along with the other preexisting ones ([[Castellbò]], [[Guissona]], [[Balaguer]]). Mur and Àger were without a doubt the most famous Catalan canonical colleges, exempt from episcopal jurisdiction

==Early Middle Ages==
[[File:SantPere SeuUrgell MNAC-015867 0002.jpg|thumb|[[Apse from La Seu d'Urgell]].]]
On the first decade of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], Berber troops set up garrisons on the northernmost hilly regions and towns. [[Uthman ibn Naissa]] settled down in [[Cerdanya]], killed the bishop of Urgell, and rebelled against central Cordovan rule in 730. The Berber lord was killed in 731, and the region subdued by [[Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi]].
   
During the [[pontificate]] of the Bishop [[Felix (Bishop of Urgell)|Felix]] (781–799), who was accused of [[adoptionism]] by the [[Carolingian]] theologians and for this motive deposed and confined to [[Lyon]], the city of Urgell and its church were completely destroyed by the Arabs around 793. With the founding of the [[Marca Hispanica]], the diocese, like the others recently restored, became part of the [[ecclesiastical province of Narbonne]] until the recreation of the [[metropolitan see of Tarragona]] in 1091. The [[Franks|Frankish]] kings intervened effectively in the country’s reconstruction, promoting the [[Reconquista|Reconquest]] laying the foundations of its government. The territory now being free, mainly, from the [[Moors]]' power, with the help of the first [[Catalan Counts]], they promoted the construction of a new cathedral, completed in the second part of the 9th century, to which were assigned 289 towns or villages—all the northwestern area of the [[Pyrenees]].

At the same time, the Urgell church, ruled for more than two centuries (914-1122) by members of the Counts' families, fully entered the ring of the feudal system, which allowed it to shape for itself an extensive seigniorial patrimony, which among other cities and territories included the city of Urgell, the valleys of [[Andorra]], the [[Vall de la Llosa]], the [[Vall d’Arques]] and the [[Ribera Salada]], the villages of [[Sanaüja]], [[Guissona]], and from 1257 onwards, [[Tremp]]. This, however, forced it into a certain dependence on the superior power of the Counts. Also, the [[Gregorian Reform]], introduced to the County of Urgell during the last years of the 11th century, preceded by the change of the [[Visigothic rite]] for the [[Roman rite]], reduced those interventions of the [[laymen]] in ecclesiastical affairs and achieved the complete freedom of the Church in the spiritual and temporal domains. Moreover, the maintenance of those possessions originated constant tension and fighting throughout the Middle Ages with the Viscounts of [[Castellbó]] and his heirs, the Counts of [[Foix]].

The foundations of the Sikh Empire can be traced to as early as 1707, the year of [[Aurangzeb]]'s death and the start of the downfall of the [[Mughal Empire]]. With the Mughals significantly weakened, the Sikh army, known as the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]], a rearrangement of the Khalsa inaugurated by [[Guru Gobind Singh]], led expeditions against them and the [[Pashtuns|Afghans]] in the west. This led to a growth of the army which split into different confederacies or semi-independent ''[[misl]]s''. Each of these component armies controlled different areas and cities. However, in the period from 1762 to 1799, Sikh commanders of the misls appeared to be coming into their own as independent warlords.

The formation of the empire began with the capture of Lahore, by Ranjit Singh, from its Afghan ruler, [[Zaman Shah Durrani]], and the subsequent and progressive expulsion of Afghans from the Punjab, by defeating them in the [[Afghan-Sikh Wars]], and the unification of the separate Sikh misls. Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Punjab on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Vaisakhi), creating a unified political state. Sahib Singh Bedi, a descendant of [[Guru Nanak]], conducted the coronation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/ The Encyclopaedia of Sikhism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508213214/http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/ |date=8 May 2014 }}, section ''Sāhib Siṅgh Bedī, Bābā (1756–1834)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjit Singh rose to power in a very short period, from a leader of a single misl to finally becoming the Maharaja of Punjab. He began to modernise his army, using the latest training as well as weapons and [[artillery]]. After the death of Ranjit Singh, the empire was weakened by internal divisions and political mismanagement. Finally, by 1849 the state was dissolved after the defeat in the [[Anglo-Sikh wars]].

The Sikh Empire was divided into four provinces: [[Lahore]], in Punjab, which became the Sikh capital, [[Multan]], also in Punjab, [[Peshawar]] and [[Kashmir]] from 1799 to 1849.

== History ==

===Background===
The [[Sikhism|Sikh religion]] began around the time of the conquest of Northern India by [[Babur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire]]. His conquering grandson, [[Akbar the Great]], supported religious freedom and after visiting the [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] of [[Guru Amar Das]] got a favourable impression of Sikhism. As a result of his visit he donated land to the langar and the Mughals did not have any conflict with [[Sikh gurus]] until his death in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalsi|2005|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Jahangir]], however, saw the Sikhs as a political threat. He ordered [[Guru Arjun Dev]], who had been arrested for supporting the rebellious [[Khusrau Mirza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markovits|2004|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; to change the passage about Islam in the [[Adi Granth]]. When the Guru refused, Jahangir ordered him to be put to death by torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |date=Jan 15, 2014 |title=Faiths Across Time: 5,000 Years of Religious History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bI9_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1163&amp;dq=khusrau+mirza+died&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y-9WVP3WDtecugTJs4CQAg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=khusrau%20mirza%20died&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=1163 |isbn= |accessdate=Nov 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guru Arjan Dev's [[martyrdom]] led to the sixth Guru, [[Guru Hargobind]], declaring Sikh [[sovereignty]] in the creation of the [[Akal Takht]] and the establishment of a fort to defend [[Amritsar]].&lt;ref name="Jestice 2004 pages=345-346"&gt;{{harvnb|Jestice|2004|pages=345–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jahangir attempted to assert authority over the Sikhs by jailing Guru Hargobind at [[Gwalior]], but released him after a number of years when he no longer felt threatened. The Sikh community did not have any further issues with the Mughal empire until the death of Jahangir in 1627. The succeeding son of Jahangir, [[Shah Jahan]], took offence at Guru Hargobind's "sovereignty" and after a series of assaults on Amritsar forced the Sikhs to retreat to the [[Sivalik Hills]].&lt;ref name="Jestice 2004 pages=345-346"/&gt;

The next guru, [[Guru Har Rai]], maintained the guruship in these hills by defeating local attempts to seize Sikh land and playing a neutral role in the power struggle between two of the sons of Shah Jahan, [[Aurangzeb]] and [[Dara Shikoh]], for control of the Mughal Empire. The ninth Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]], moved the Sikh community to [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] and travelled extensively to visit and preach in defiance of Aurangzeb, who attempted to install [[Ramraiya|Ram Rai]] as new guru. Guru Tegh Bahadur aided [[Kashmiri Pandits]] in avoiding conversion to [[Islam]] and was arrested by Aurangzeb. When offered a choice between conversion to Islam and death, he chose to die rather than compromise his principles and was executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johar|1975|pages=192–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guru Gobind Singh]] assumed the guruship in 1675 and to avoid battles with Sivalik Hill rajas moved the guruship to [[Paonta Sahib|Paunta]]. There he built a large fort to protect the city and garrisoned an army to protect it. The growing power of the Sikh community alarmed the Sivalik Hill rajas who attempted to attack the city but [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s forces routed them at the [[Battle of Bhangani]]. He moved on to Anandpur and established the [[Khalsa]], a collective army of baptised Sikhs, on 30 March 1699.&lt;ref name=Gobind/&gt; The establishment of the Khalsa united the Sikh community against various Mughal-backed claimants to the guruship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jestice|2004|pages=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, a combined army of the Sivalik Hill rajas and the Mughals under [[Wazir Khan (Sirhind)|Wazir Khan]] attacked Anandpur. The Khalsa retreated but regrouped to defeat the Mughals at the [[Battle of Muktsar]]. In 1707, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] accepted an invitation by Aurangzeb's successor [[Bahadur Shah I]] to meet him. The meeting took place at [[Agra]] on 23 July 1707.&lt;ref name=Gobind&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/ |title=Gobind Singh Guru (1666-1708) |last1=Ganda Singh |website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=11 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508213214/http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/ |archivedate=8 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1708 Guru Gobind Singh visited [[Nanded]], the seat of Mughal [[Telangana Subah]]. There he met a Bairāgī recluse, Madho Das, and converted him to Sikhism, giving him a new name, [[Banda Singh Bahadur|Banda Singh]].&lt;ref name=Gobind/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banda Singh Bahadur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51460/Banda-Singh-Bahadur |title=Banda Singh Bahadur |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banda Singh Bahadur (1670–1716; also known as ''Lachman Das'', ''Lachman Dev'' and ''Madho Das''&lt;ref name="Banda Singh Bahadur"/&gt;) met Guru Gobind Singh at Nanded and adopted the Sikh religion. A short time before his death, Guru Gobind Singh ordered him to reconquer Punjab region and gave him a letter that commanded all Sikhs to join him. After two years of gaining supporters, Banda Singh Bahadur initiated an agrarian uprising by breaking up the large estates of [[Zamindar#Mughal Era|Zamindar families]] and distributing the land to the poor peasants who farmed the land.&lt;ref name="Singh 2008 pages=25-26"&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|2008 |pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banda Singh Bahadur started his rebellion with the defeat of Mughal armies at [[Samana, India|Samana]] and [[Sadhaura]] and the rebellion culminated in the defeat of [[Sirhind]]. During the rebellion, Banda Singh Bahadur made a point of destroying the cities in which Mughals had been cruel to the supporters of Guru Gobind Singh. He executed Wazir Khan in revenge for the deaths of Guru Gobind Singh's sons and Pir Budhu Shah after the Sikh victory at [[Sirhind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nesbitt |2005 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ruled the territory between the [[Sutlej river]] and the [[Yamuna river]], established a capital in the [[Himalayas]] at [[Lohgarh]] and struck [[coin]]age in the names of [[Guru Nanak]] and Guru Gobind Singh.&lt;ref name="Singh 2008 pages=25-26"/&gt; In 1716, his army was defeated by the Mughals after he attempted to defend his fort at Gurdas Nangal. He was captured along with 700 of his men and sent to [[Delhi]], where they were all tortured and executed after refusing to convert to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Kulwant|title=Sri Gur Panth Prakash: Episodes 1 to 81|year=2006|publisher=Institute of Sikh Studies|isbn=9788185815282|page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The formal start of the Sikh Empire began with the merger of these "[[Misl]]s" by the time of coronation of [[Ranjit Singh]] in 1801, creating a unified political state. All the Misl leaders, who were affiliated with the army, were the nobility with usually long and prestigious family backgrounds in Sikh history.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition 1911 Page 892"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PYR_RAY/RANJIT_SINGH_MAHARAJA_178o_1839.html |title=MAHARAJAH RANJIT SINGH … - Online Information article about MAHARAJA RANJIT SINGH |publisher=Encyclopedia.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main geographical footprint of the empire was from the [[Punjab region]] to [[Khyber Pass]] in the west, to Kashmir in the north, [[Sindh]] in the south, and [[Tibet]] in the east.

===End of the Sikh Empire===
After Ranjit Singh's death in 1839, the empire was severely weakened by internal divisions and political mismanagement. This opportunity was used by the [[British East India Company]] to launch the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|Anglo-Sikh Wars]].

The [[Battle of Ferozeshah]] in 1845 marked many turning points, the British encountered the [[Punjab Army]], opening with a gun-duel in which the Sikhs "had the better of the British artillery". As the British made advances, Europeans in their army were especially targeted, as the Sikhs believed if the army "became demoralised, the backbone of the enemy's position would be broken".&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Singh: administration and British policy, (Prakash, p.31-33)&lt;/ref&gt;  The fighting continued throughout the night. The British position "grew graver as the night wore on", and "suffered terrible casualties with every single member of the Governor General's staff either killed or wounded".&lt;ref name="Maharaja Ranjit Singh p.136-137"&gt;Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the last to lay arms, (Duggal, p.136-137)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the British army took and held Ferozeshah. British General Sir [[James Hope Grant]] recorded: "Truly the night was one of gloom and forbidding and perhaps never in the annals of warfare has a British Army on such a large scale been nearer to a defeat which would have involved annihilation."&lt;ref name="Maharaja Ranjit Singh p.136-137"/&gt;

The reasons for the withdrawal of the Sikhs from Ferozeshah are contentious. Some believe that it was treachery of the non-Sikh high command of their own army which led to them marching away from a British force in a precarious and battered state. Others believe that a tactical withdrawal was the best policy.&lt;ref&gt;Frasier, G.M. (1990) Flashman and the Mountain of Light, Harper-Collins, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikh empire was finally dissolved at the end of the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849 into separate [[princely states]] and the British [[Punjab (British India)|province of Punjab]]. Eventually, a Lieutenant Governorship was formed in Lahore as a direct representative of the [[British Crown]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Joppen1907India1805a.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Indian subcontinent in 1805 CE.]]
The [[Punjab]] was a region straddling India and the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Durrani Empire]]. The following modern-day political divisions made up the historical Sikh Empire:
*[[Punjab]] till [[Multan]] in south
** parts of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Panjab (Punjab)]], Pakistan, with the capital Lahaur (Lahore)
** Parts of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], India

[[Jamrud]] District ([[Khyber Agency]], Pakistan) was the westernmost limit of the Sikh Empire. The westward expansion was stopped in the [[Battle of Jamrud]], in which the Afghans managed to kill the prominent Sikh general [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] in an offensive, though the Sikhs successfully held their position at their Jamrud fort. Ranjit Singh sent his General Sirdar Bahadur Gulab Singh Powind thereafter as reinforcement and he crushed the Pashtun rebellion harshly.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings Donnan, ''Marriage Among Muslims: Preference and Choice in Northern Pakistan'', (Brill, 1997), 41.[https://books.google.com/books?id=PL_ACoFwJ2gC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=raja+gulab+singh+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5VEwT9G8NoanrAfg-dmeBA&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=raja%20gulab%20singh%20revolt&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, Ranjit Singh with his troops marched into Kabul to take part in the victory parade along with the British after restoring Shah Shoja to the Afghan throne at Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/491193/Ranjit-Singh Encyclopædia Britannica - Ranjit Singh]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikh Empire was idiosyncratic in that it allowed men from religions other than their own to rise to commanding positions of authority.&lt;ref&gt;Kartar Singh Duggal (1 January 2001).

In this regard, Masson's explanation is perhaps the most pertinent: "Though compared to the Afghans, the Sikhs were mild and exerted a protecting influence, yet no advantages could compensate to their Mohammedan subjects, the idea of subjection to infidels, and the prohibition to slay [[Cattle|kine]], and to repeat the ''azan'', or 'summons to prayer'."&lt;ref&gt;Masson, Charles. 1842.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Structure of Handel's ''Messiah''}}
:''For the full text, scriptural references and sound samples, see [[s:Messiah|''Messiah'' on Wikisource]]''
'''''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''''' ([[HWV]] 56), the English-language [[oratorio]] composed by [[George Frideric Handel]] in 1741, is '''structured''' in three parts, listed here in tables for their musical setting and biblical sources.

== Oratorio ==

The [[libretto]] by [[Charles Jennens]] is drawn from the Bible: mostly from the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]], but with several [[psalms]] taken from the [[Book of Common Prayer]].&lt;ref name="Block 2001" /&gt; Regarding the text, Jennens commented: "...the Subject excells every other Subject. The Subject is Messiah ...".&lt;ref name="Heighes 1997" /&gt;

''Messiah'' differs from Handel's other oratorios in that it does not contain an encompassing narrative, instead offering contemplation on different aspects of the Christian Messiah:

{{quote
| ''Messiah'' is not typical Handel oratorio; there are no named characters, as are usually found in Handel’s setting of the Old Testament stories, possibly to avoid charges of blasphemy. It is a meditation rather than a drama of personalities, lyrical in method; the narration of the story is carried on by implication, and there is no dialogue.
| [[Christopher Hogwood]]{{r|Block 2001}}
}}

=== Structure and concept ===

The oratorio's structure follows the [[liturgical year]]: Part I corresponding with [[Advent]], [[Christmas]], and the life of Jesus; Part II with [[Lent]], [[Easter]], the [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]], and [[Pentecost]]; and Part III with the end of the church year—dealing with the end of time. The birth and death of Jesus are told in the words of the prophet [[Isaiah]], the most prominent source for the libretto. The only true "scene" of the oratorio is the [[annunciation to the shepherds]] which is taken from the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name="Gascoigne 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luckett 1992" /&gt; The imagery of shepherd and lamb features prominently in many movements, for example: in the aria "He shall feed His flock like a shepherd" (the only extended piece to talk about the Messiah on earth), in the opening of Part II ("Behold the Lamb of God"), in the chorus "All we like sheep", and in the closing chorus of the work ("Worthy is the Lamb").

=== Scenes ===

The librettist arranged his compilation in "scenes", each concentrating on a topic.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2012" /&gt;
; Part I: "The prophecy and realisation of God's plan to redeem mankind by the coming of the Messiah"
: [[Messiah Part I#Scene 1|Scene 1]]: "Isaiah's prophecy of salvation" (movements 2–4)
: [[Messiah Part I#Scene 2|Scene 2]]: "The prophecy of the coming of Messiah and the question, despite (1), of what this may portend for the World" (movements 5–7)
: [[Messiah Part I#Scene 3|Scene 3]]: "The prophecy of the Virgin Birth" (movements 8–12)
: [[Messiah Part I#Scene 4|Scene 4]]: "The appearance of the Angels to the Shepherds" (movements 13–17)
: [[Messiah Part I#Scene 5|Scene 5]]: "Christ's redemptive miracles on earth" (movements 18–21)
; Part II: "The accomplishment of redemption by the sacrifice of Christ, mankind's rejection of God's offer, and mankind's utter defeat when trying to oppose the power of the Almighty"
: [[Messiah Part II#Scene 1|Scene 1]]: "The redemptive sacrifice, the scourging and the agony on the cross" (movements 22–30)
: [[Messiah Part II#Scene 2|Scene 2]]: "His sacrificial death, His passage through Hell and Resurrection" (movements 31–32)
: [[Messiah Part II#Scene 3|Scene 3]]: "His ascension" (movement 33)
: [[Messiah Part II#Scene 4|Scene 4]]: "God discloses his identity in Heaven" (movements 34–35)
: [[Messiah Part II#Scene 5|Scene 5]]: "Whitsun, the gift of tongues, the beginning of evangelism" (movements 36–39)
: [[Messiah Part II#Scene 6|Scene 6]]: "The world and its rulers reject the Gospel" (movements 40–41)
: [[Messiah Part II#Scene 7|Scene 7]]: "God's triumph" (movements 42–44)
; Part III: "A Hymn of Thanksgiving for the final overthrow of Death"
: [[Messiah Part III#Scene 1|Scene 1]]: "The promise of bodily resurrection and redemption from Adam's fall" (movements 45–46)
: [[Messiah Part III#Scene 2|Scene 2]]: "The Day of Judgment and general Resurrection" (movements 47–48)
: [[Messiah Part III#Scene 3|Scene 3]]: "The victory over death and sin" (movements 49–52)
: [[Messiah Part III#Scene 4|Scene 4]]: "The glorification of the Messianic victim" (movement 53)

=== Music ===

By the time Handel composed ''Messiah'' in London he was already a successful and experienced composer of Italian operas, and had created sacred works based on English texts, such as the 1713 ''[[Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate]]'', and numerous oratorios on English [[Libretto|libretti]]. For ''Messiah'', Handel used the same musical technique as for those works, namely a structure based on chorus and solo singing.

The orchestra scoring is simple: [[oboe]]s, [[String instrument|strings]] and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]] of [[harpsichord]], [[violoncello]], [[violone]] and [[bassoon]]. Two [[trumpet]]s and [[timpani]] highlight selected movements, in Part I the song of the angels, ''Glory to God in the highest'', and with [[timpani]] the closing movements of both Part II, ''Hallelujah'', and of Part III, ''Worthy is the Lamb''.

Only two movements in ''Messiah'' are purely instrumental: the overture (written as "Sinfony" in Handel's autograph) and the Pifa (a [[pastorale]] introducing the shepherds in Bethlehem); and only a few movements are a duet or a combination of solo and chorus. The solos are typically a combination of recitative and aria. The arias are called Airs or Songs, and some of them are in [[da capo]] form, but rarely in a strict sense (repeating the first section after a sometimes contrasting middle section). Handel found various ways to use the format freely to convey the meaning of the text. Occasionally verses from different biblical sources are combined into one movement, however more often a coherent text section is set in consecutive movements, for example the first "[[Messiah structure#Scenes|scene]]" of the work, the annunciation of [[Christian salvation|Salvation]], is set as a sequence of three movements: recitative, aria and chorus. The center of Part III is a sequence of six movements based on a passage from [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] on the resurrection of the dead, a passage that [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] also chose for ''[[A German Requiem (Brahms)|Ein deutsches Requiem]]''.

The movements marked "Recitative" (Rec.) are "[[Recitative#Secco|secco]]", accompanied by only the [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|continuo]], whereas the recitatives marked "Accompagnato" (Acc.) are accompanied by additional string instruments. Handel used four voice parts, [[soprano]] (S), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B) in the solo and choral movements. Only once is the chorus divided in an upper chorus and a lower chorus, it is [[SATB]] otherwise. Handel uses both [[Polyphony|polyphon]] and [[Homophony|homophon]] settings to illustrate the text. Even polyphon movements typically end on a dramatic long musical [[Rest (music)|rest]], followed by a broad homophon conclusion. Handel often stresses a word by extended [[coloratura]]s, especially in several movements which are a [[Parody#Music|parody]] of music composed earlier on Italian texts. He uses a [[cantus firmus]] on long repeated notes especially to illustrate God's speech and majesty, for example "for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it" in movement [[#4|4]].&lt;ref name="Burrows 1991" /&gt;

=== General notes ===

The following tables are organized by movement numbers. There are two major systems of numbering the movements of ''Messiah'': the historic [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]] edition of 1959 (which is based on earlier editions and contains 53 movements), and the [[Bärenreiter]] edition of 1965 in the [[Hallische Händel-Ausgabe]]. Not counting some short recitatives as separate movements, it has 47 movements. The Novello number (Nov) is given first, then the Bärenreiter number (Bär).

The '''Sultanate of Maguindanao''' ([[Maguindanao language|Maguindanaon]]: ''Kasultanan nu Magindanaw''; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: كسولتانن ماڬوايندنااو; [[Iranun language|Iranun]]: ''Kesultanan a Magindanao'';  {{lang-fil|Kasultanan ng Maguindanao}}; {{lang-ar|سلطنة ماجوينداناو}}) was a [[Sultan]]ate state that ruled parts of the island of [[Mindanao]], in southern [[Philippines]], especially in modern-day [[Maguindanao|Maguindanao province]] and [[Davao City]]. Its known historical influence stretches from the [[Zamboanga Peninsula|peninsula of Zamboanga]] to the bay of [[Sarangani]]. At its peak, the sultanate covered the entire island of [[Mindanao]], and ruled over the smaller neighboring islands near and around Mindanao. During the era of [[Age of Exploration|European colonization]], the Sultanate maintained friendly relations with British and Dutch traders.&lt;ref name="National Historical Comission"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palafox|first=Queenie|title=The Sultan of the River|url=http://www.nhcp.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=574|publisher=National Historical Commission|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{see also|Islam in the Philippines|Religion in pre-colonial Philippines|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation}}

During the indigenous era, there were two brothers named Mamalu and Tabunaway, who lived peacefully in Mindanao, specifically the Cotabato valley. When Shariff Kabungsuwan preached Islam in the area in the 16th century, Tabunaway converted, while Mamalu decided to hold fast to the beliefs of their elders. The brothers parted ways afterwards; Tabunaway to the lowlands and Mamalu to the mountains, but they vowed to honor their kinship, and thus an unwritten pact of peace between Muslims and indigenous peoples was forged through the two brothers.&lt;ref&gt;http://opinion.inquirer.net/113070/cotabato-tells-stories&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammed Kabungsuwan|Shariff Mohammed Kabungsuwan]] of [[Johor]] introduced [[Islam]] in the area, which was earlier [[Hindu]] influenced from Srivijaya times, at the end of the 16th century and established himself as Sultan seated in Malabang-Lanao. He exiled some of his people who deviated from the Islamic faith to Cotabato. He subsequently married many local princesses of the Maguinadanao family ruling class in Dulawan and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao seated in Dulawan and virtually as Sultan of the whole island of the so-called Mindanao.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnlf.net/History/The%20Maguindanao%20Sultanate.htm "The Maguindanao Sultanate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030126203422/http://www.mnlf.net/History/The%20Maguindanao%20Sultanate.htm |date=2003-01-26 }}, Moro National Liberation Front web site. "The Political and Religious History of the Bangsamoro People, condensed from the book ''Muslims in the Philippines'' by Dr. C. A. Majuli." Retrieved January 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The sultanate was usually centered in the valley of [[Cotabato]].

[[Sultan Dipatuan Kudarat|Asraf Mohamad Samalan Dipatuan Qudratullah Fahar'uddin Nasiruddin]], popularly known as Qudarat and whose name as a youth was Ullah Untong, was one of the greatest known sultans who controlled Mindanao. In his island sanctuary in Sulu, he was known as Sultan Nasiruddin and was the Sultan of that island recognized by the Sulu Sultan and his grave still stands there.

Abd al-Rahman, his grandson, continued increasing the Sultanate's power and influence.

During the Spanish colonial period, the Sultanate of Maguindanao was able to defend its territory, preventing the Spaniards from colonising the entire Mindanao and ceding the island of Palawan to the Spanish government in 1705. The island priory ceded to him by Sulu Sultan Sahabuddin. This was to have help dissuaded Spanish encroachments into the island of Maguindanao and Sulu itself.

==List of Sultans of Maguindanao==

As to the historical records, there were 12 Sultans of Maguindanao.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Philippines.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1. Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuwan'''

{{See also|Sharif Kabungsuwan}}

Tarsilas by Dr. Sleeby and Dr. Majul researched indicated of Sharif Ali Kabungsuwan (Karim Ul-Makdum) was Abu'Baik the brother of Abu'Bkr-Zein Ul-Abidin the Sulu Sultan Sharif Ul-Hashim. Their father was Sultan Betatar of Taif Arabia the 9th generation progeny of Hassan (son of Fatima, the daughter of [[Muhammad]]). Sharif Kabungsuwan Seated in Malabang Lanao who exiled Muslims to Dulawan Cotabato who had deviated from Islamic Jurisprudence. And again drove those stubborn ones were drove to the hinterlands where they later became the Manobos. Kabungsuwan's mother was a member of the [[Johor Sultanate|Johore royalty]] of Singapore. It may be speculated that he arrived on the shores of Mindanao around 1515. He was the second Makdum (Karim Ul-Makdum) who had come and reinforced Islam. He married the daughter of Tomoai Aliwya of the Maguindanao Family Dynasty. After his father in-law's death, the latter's political authority fell on Kabungsuwan who had established the Sultanate of Maguindanao as its first Sultan reigning as Sultan Aliwya. shariff Kabunsuan was given the authority and power to lead by Rajah Tabunaway and apo Mamalu the son of Shariff Maradja from Johore. Rajah Tabunaway was the one who accept Kabunsuan at the river PUlangi river.

'''2. Sharief Maka-alang'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a son of Muhammad Kabungsuwan and surnamed “Saripada”. His mother Angintabu was a daughter of an Iranun chief from the area now known as Malabang. In 1543, during the Villalobos expedition, some Spaniards were able to go to the mouth of a big river (Pulangi) where they were informed by the inhabitants that the chief was called “Sarriparra”. This being a variation of “salipada” or “saripada”, it can be surmised that the chief was the Sharif Maka-alang; especially if it is considered that not only does a tarsila explicitly state that the Sharif had such a title but that such a title was not found among his immediate successors.

'''3. Datu Bangkaya'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a son of Sharif Maka-alang. In 1574, Guido de Lavezaris wrote to the Spanish King that the chief of Mindanao River wanted to become a friend of the Spaniards. In another Spanish report dated 1579, this chief is referred to as “Asulutan” (Arabic, As-sulutan) with the information that he was a father of Diman Sankay and that he had already died. This refers probably to Datu Bangkaya who by 1574 must have been reigning for some time, since in 1579, his son Dimansankay, was considered by the Spaniards to have been “an old man”. Datu Bangkaya could also have been the ruler in the Pulangi who was reported to have died in 1578.

'''4. Datu Dimasankay'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a son of Bangkaya. Spanish reports say that he was ruling in 1579 and that he was an old man. The leading datus of the Iranuns and Maranaos all claim descent from him.

'''5. [[Gugu Sarikula|Datu Salikula]]'''&lt;br /&gt;He was the half-brother of Dimansankay and also known as Gugu Salikula. Up to early 1597, he appeared to be a lading chief of Maguindanao, Dimansankay being dead at that time. According to tarsilas, he married a Sulu princess, and therefore he might have been the Maguindanao chief seen in Jolo in 1597 where he was supposed to have been banished for being “restless and rebellious” and who was further described as a brother-in-law of the Sulu ruler and an uncle of the Maguindanao Rajah Muda (erroneously called “King”) by the Spaniards. He was chief around 1585 to 1597.

'''6. Kapitan Laut Buisan'''

{{See also|Kapitan Laut Buisan}}

He was a younger half-brother of both Dimansankay and Salikula; he was sometimes called by the title “Katchil”. His rule began around 1597 when he displaced Salikula; he controlled his nephew, the Rajah Muda, a son of Dimansankay. He must have been chief at least up to 1619, since Dutch sources mention relations with the immediate predecessor of Qudarat at this date.

'''7. Sultan Kudarat'''

{{See also|Muhammad Kudarat}}

A son of Buisan, he was known to the Spaniards as Corralat and to some Dutch writers as Guserat. In 1619-1621, there was war between Buayan and Maguindanao, probably dynastic or a contest for primacy in the Pulangi. Qudarat must have been involved in this war for not long after a temporary reversal he appears as exercising some political power over Buayan. Furthermore, he must have consolidated his power well enough after this to enable him to attack Sarangani in 1625. He died about the end of 1671 after having ruled about half a century. His rule, with varying fortunes and at different capitals can, therefore, be fairly estimated to have taken place from 1619 to 1671. By 1645, he was already using the title of “sultan”. As a young man he was entitled “Katchil”. His great grandchildren referred to him as Nasir ud-Din.

'''8. Sultan Dundang Tidulay'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a son of Qudarat and there is a report that he died before his father. If he ruled at all, it must have been for a very short time. He was referred to as Saif ud-Din by his grandchildren.&lt;br /&gt;'''9. Sultan Barahaman (Arabic, ‘Abd ur-Rahman)''' &lt;br /&gt;He was a son of Sultan Tidulay. He was also known as Minulu sa rahmatullah. His sons referred to him as Muhammad Shah. He was Almo Sobat (Arabic, Al Mu-Thabbat) to William Dampier or the Almo al Lasab Brahaman to the Spaniards. The name of his grandfather Qudarat was also used by him. He was heard of as sultan early as 1678. Information given to Dutch officials at Ternate was that he died on July 6, 1699.

'''10. Sultan Kahar Ud-din Kuda'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a younger brother of Barahaman and was sometimes known as Jamal ul-‘Azam. He also assumed the title of Amir ul-‘Umara as well as that of Maulana. His reign was contested by two of his nephews, the sons of Barahaman. To make more secure his authority, he asked the aid of the Sulu Sultan Shahab ud-Din who came over to Simuay where Kuda held court. A misunderstanding as well as bitterness due to a long standing feud brought about a pitched battle between the Sulus and Maguindanaos. In the struggle, the Sulu Sultan personally slew Kuda. This event took place on August 10, 1702.

'''11. Sultan Bayan Ul-Anwar'''&lt;br /&gt;His other regal name was Jalal ud-Din. Entitled “Dipatuan” during his lifetime, he was known after his death as Mupat Batua. He was a son of Sultan Barahaman. In 1701, he was already intriguing against his uncle the Sultan. He succeeded to the throne in 1702 and held court in Slangan but was often in Sibugay. His younger brother Ja’far Sadiq, the Rajah Muda, revolted against him but managed to keep the throne. In 1736, Anwar “abdicated” in favor of his son Tahir ud- Din Malinug (no. 13). He died around 1745.

'''12. Sultan Muhammad Ja’far Sadiq Manamir'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a younger brother of Sultan Bayan ul-Anwar. He was sometimes referred to as Amir ud-Din. Referred to as Maulana while alive, he was known after his death as Shahid Mupat. He contested the reign of his older brother, but he was forced to flee to Tamontaka in 1710. Dutch officials referred to him as “the young king” to distinguish him from Sultan Bayan ul Anwar. By 1725 he had assumed the title of Paduka Sri Sultan. In March 1733, his brother and nephew Malinug attacked his forces in Tamontaka. The latter caused his death in the ensuing struggle. While his brother had power along the coast, Manamir held sway over the interior. His power was recognized in Tamontaka from about 1710 to his death in March 1733.

'''13. Sultan Muhammad Tahir Ud-din'''&lt;br /&gt;A son of Sultan Bayan ul-Anwar, he was commonly known to the Spaniards as Dipatuan Malinug. He was also known as Muhammad Shah Amir ud-Din. In a battle in 1733, he killed his uncle Ja’far Sadiq Manamir. In 1736, his father started sharing with him the responsibilities of government.
His authority was however contested by two of his cousins, sons of Manamir, forcing him to retire to the interior where he died in Buayan around 1748.

'''14. Sultan Muhammad Khair Ud-din'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a son of Sultan Ja’far Sadiq and was better known to Europeans as Pakir Maulana Kamsa (Arabic, Faqir Maulana Hamzah) or Amir ud-Din Hamza. He also used the name ‘Azim ud-Din and assumed the title Amir ul-Mu’minin. In 1733, after his father was slain, he began to consider himself heir to the throne and thereupon called himself “rajah muda”. The next year, he was formally invested with the duties of a sultan in the presence of the Spanish officials from Zamboanga. With some Spanish aid, he was able to consolidate his position in Tamontaka and contest the rule of his uncle Bayan ul-Anwar and later that of his cousin Malinug. But upon the latter’s death around 1748, the struggle for the sultanate ceased. Pakir Maulana Kamsa emerged as paramount chief of Maguindanao. Around 1755, he started to relinquish some of his powers to his younger brother with the condition that his son, Kibad Sahriyal, would be the “Rajah Muda”.

'''15. Sultan Pahar Ud-din'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a younger brother of Pakir Maulan Kamsa and was known as Datu Pongloc or Panglu. He began to exercise the powers of sultan around 1755 and was in the sultan’s seat in that same year when Captain Thomas Forrest paid a visit to Maguindanao. After his death he was known as Mupat Hidayat.

'''16. Sultan Kibad Sahriyal'''&lt;br /&gt;His more regal title was Muhammad ‘Azim ud-Din Amir ul-Umara. He was a son of Pakir Maulana Kamsa. Even before the death of his uncle the Sultan, he was already being addressed as “sultan”. He was friendly towards the Spaniards and at least twice entered into peaceful negotiations with them, namely, in 1780 and 1794. He probably governed from 1780 to 1805.

'''17. Sultan Kawasa Anwar Ud-din'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a son of Kibad Sahriyal and like his father was also entitled Amir ul-‘Umara. He entered into a peace treaty with the Spaniards in 1805. One of his seals carried the title of Iskandar Julkarnain. He possibly reigned from 1805 to 1830.

'''18. Sultan Iskandar Qudraullah Muhammad Zamal Ul-Azam'''&lt;br /&gt;He was more popularly known as Sultan Untong. He was a grandson of Kibad Sahriyal and a nephew of Sultan Kawasa. Some Spanish documents carry his name as Iskandar Qudarat Pahar-ud-Din. In 1837 and 1845, he entered into friendly treaties with the Spaniards. He died either in 1853 and 1854.

'''19. Sultan Muhammad Makakwa'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a grandson of Sultan Kawasa Anwar ud-Din. His rule can be estimated to have lasted from about 1854 to 1884. He died in Nuling (in the site of the old settlement of Maguindanao).

'''20. Sultan Mohammad Jalal Ud-din Pablu'''&lt;br /&gt;Also known as Sultan Wata, he was a son of Sultan Makakwa. His capital was at Banubu, just opposite the town of Cotabato across the Pulangi. His death took place in 1888.

'''21. Sultan Mangigin'''&lt;br /&gt;He was a grandson of the famous Datu Dakula of Sibugay, who in turn, was a grandson of Kibad Sahriyal (No. 16). He began his rule in 1896. From 1888 to 1896, the sultanate was vacant. This was probably due to the fact that Datu Utto (Sultan Anwar ud-Din of Buayan) wanted his brother-in-law Datu Mamaku (a son of Sultan Qudratullah Untong) to become the Sultan. The Spaniards, however, wanted the sultanate to go to one of the Sibugay datus. Around the end of 1900, Sultan Mangigin transferred his residence from Cotabato to Sibugay. In 1906, he married Rajah Putri, the widow of Datu Utto and sister of Datu Mamaku.

'''22. Sultan Muhammad Hijaban Iskandar Mastura Kudarat'''&lt;br /&gt;He assumed the throne upon Mangigin’s death in 1926. By this time, the Sultanate assumed a very ceremonial traditional character. It continued to be the central institution for traditional and religious affairs of the Maguindanao and Iranun peoples.

The '''Therapeutae''' were a Jewish sect, including men and women, which existed in [[Alexandria]] and other parts of the [[Diaspora]] of [[Hellenistic Judaism]] in the final years of the [[Second Temple period]]. 

The primary source concerning the Therapeutae is the [[Philo's works|''De vita contemplativa'' ("The Contemplative Life")]] (purportedly by the Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] (c. 20 BCE – 50 CE).&lt;ref&gt;The authorship has been called into question because of the different stance on Greek philosophy of this work from that of other works that were written by Philo and because elsewhere Philo makes no mention of the Therapeutae. See [[Philo's work]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Toy |first1=Crawford Howell |last2=Siegfried |first2=Carl |last3=Lauterbach |first3=Jacob Zallel |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=281&amp;letter=P |title=PHILO JUDÆUS }}&lt;/ref&gt;) The author appears to have been personally acquainted with them. The author describes the Therapeutae as "philosophers" (cf. I.2) and mentions a group that lived on a low hill by the [[Lake Mareotis]] close to [[Alexandria]] in circumstances resembling [[Lavra|lavrite]] life (cf. III.22). They were "the best" of a kind given to "perfect goodness" that "exists in many places in the inhabited world" (cf. III.21). The author was unsure of the origin of the name and derives the name Therapeutae/Therapeutides from [[Greek language|Greek]] θεραπεύω in the sense of "cure" or "worship" (cf. I.2).

Some interpret the Therapeutae as early Christian monks.

== De vita contemplativa account ==
The author described the Therapeutae in ''[[De vita contemplativa]]'' ("On the contemplative life"), written in the first century CE. The origins of the Therapeutae were unclear, and Philo was even unsure about the etymology of their name, which he explained as meaning either physicians of souls or servants of God. The opening phrases of his essay establish that it followed one that has been lost, on the active life. Philo was employing the familiar polarity in Hellenic philosophy between the active and the contemplative life, exemplifying the active life by the [[Essenes]], another severely ascetic sect, and the contemplative life by the desert-dwelling Therapeutae.

[[File:Dura Europos fresco Moses from river.jpg|250px|thumb|Hellenistic Jewish synagogue fresco Moses being taken from the river Nile]]
According to ''De Vita Contemplativa'', the Therapeutae were widely distributed in the Ancient world, among the Greeks and beyond in the non-Greek world of the "[[barbarians]]", with one of their major gathering points being in [[Alexandria]], in the area of the [[Lake Mareotis]]:

{{quote|Now this class of persons may be met with in many places, for it was fitting that both Greece and the country of the barbarians should partake of whatever is perfectly good; and there is the greatest number of such men in Egypt, in every one of the districts, or nomes, as they are called, and especially around Alexandria; and from all quarters those who are the best of these therapeutae proceed on their pilgrimage to some most suitable place as if it were their country, which is beyond the Maereotic lake.|''De Vita Contemplativa''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/philo-ascetics.html On Ascetics] (another name for the ''De Vita Contemplativa''), Section III.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Teachings and lifestyle ===

====Temperance and simplicity====
They lived chastely with utter simplicity; they "first of all laid down temperance as a sort of foundation for the soul to rest upon, proceed to build up other virtues on this foundation" (Philo). They renounced property and followed severe discipline:
{{quote|These men abandon their property without being influenced by any predominant attraction, and flee without even turning their heads back again.|De Vita Contemplativa'' para. 18}}

====Six days per week of solitude, meeting on seventh day, with teaching and hymns====
They were dedicated to the contemplative life, and their activities for six days of the week consisted of [[ascetic]] practices, fasting, solitary prayers and the study of the scriptures in their isolated cells, each with its separate holy sanctuary, and enclosed courtyard:

{{quote|the entire interval from dawn to evening is given up by them to spiritual exercises. For they read the holy scriptures and draw out in thought and [[allegory]] their ancestral philosophy, since they regard the literal meanings as symbols of an inner and hidden nature revealing itself in covert ideas.|De Vita Contemplativa, para. 28}}

On the seventh day the Therapeutae met in a meeting house, the men on one side of an open partition, the women modestly on the other, to hear discourses. Once in seven weeks they meet for a night-long vigil after a banquet where they served one another, for "they are not waited on by slaves, because they deem any possession of servants whatever to be contrary to nature. For she has begotten all men alike free" (''De Vita Contemplativa'', para.70) and sing [[Antiphonary|antiphonal]] hymns until dawn.

===Written teachings===
In addition to the [[Pentateuch]], the [[Prophet]]s and [[Psalms]] they possessed arcane writings of their own tradition, including formulae for numerological and allegorical interpretations.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Healing===
The author notes that they "professed an art of healing superior to that practiced in the cities".&lt;ref&gt;Some are reminded of the later healer [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testament of Job==
The [[Old Testament Pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphic]] ''[[Testament of Job]]'' is seen as possibly a Therapeutae text.&lt;ref&gt;Spittler, Russel Paul (1983), 'Testament of Job', in James H. Charlesworth (ed. Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Vol I Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Joan E., "Virgin Mothers: Philo on the Women Therapeutae," Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha, 12.1(2001): 37-63. doi:10.1177/095182070101200102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Christian interpretations==
The 3rd-century Christian writer [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (c. 263–339), in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', identified Philo's Therapeutae as the first Christian monks, identifying their renunciation of property, chastity, fasting, and solitary lives with the cenobitic ideal of the Christian monks.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine Scouteris, University of Athens [http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/patrology/scouteris_theraputae.htm Source] "The semianchoritic character of the Therapeutae community, the renunciation of property, the solitude during the six days of the week and the gathering together on Saturday for the common prayer and the common meal, the severe fasting, the keeping alive of the memory of God, the continuous prayer, the meditation and study of Holy Scripture were also practices of the Christian anchorites of the Alexandrian desert." http://www.omhros.gr/kat/history/Txt/Rl/Therapeutae.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Constantine Scouteris, "The ''Therapeutae'' of Philo and the Monks as Therapeutae according to Pseudo-Dionysius Scouteris, The ''Therapeutae'' of Philo and the Monks as Therapeutae according to Pseudo-Dionysius&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th-century Christian heresiologist [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c. 315–403), bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, author of the ''Panarion,'' or ''Medicine Chest against Heresies'', misidentified Philo's Therapeuate as "Jessaens" and considered them a Christian group.

The 5th-century Christian writer [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], following Philo, interprets that "Some people gave to the ascetics the name 'Therapeutae' or servants while some others gave them the name monks". Pseudo-Dionysius interprets Philo's group as a highly organized Christian ascetic order, and the meaning of the name "Therapeutae" as "servants".&lt;ref&gt;Constantine Scouteris, University of Athens [http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/patrology/scouteris_theraputae.htm Source] "The contribution of Pseudo-Dionysius lies in the fact that, not only has he not rejected Philo's thought, but he enriched it with a distinctly Christian attitude. Or to put it differently. Pseudo-Dionysiu's purpose was to present the Christian teaching concerning the monastic way; and he did so using the Philonian language, symbols and categories."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1491">'''Yazdagird''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: یزدگرد) was the ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 1271 to 1298. He was the cousin and successor of [[Ali of Tabaristan]].
