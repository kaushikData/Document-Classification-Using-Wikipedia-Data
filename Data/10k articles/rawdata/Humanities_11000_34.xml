The '''Prague Declaration''' was a declaration released by a number of right-wing anti-Islam groupings after a meeting held in [[Roztoky]], near [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] on 23 January 2016. It was on an initiative by [[Lutz Bachmann]], founder of [[Pegida]].

The signatories to the declaration were Blok proti islámu, [[Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond]], [[Lega Nord]], Odvaha, [[Pegida]] Austria, Pegida Bulgaria, Pegida Germany, [[Pegida Netherlands]], [[Ruch Narodowy]] and [[Dawn - National Coalition|Úsvit - Národní Koalice]]. 

Those present signed the declaration known as the 2016 Prague Declaration calling in unison, "We are [[Pegida#Fortress Europe|Fortress Europe]]," and then in German, "Wir sind Festung Europa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fortress Europe: PEGIDA to be joined by 14 anti-Islam allies for mass February protests|url=https://www.rt.com/news/330075-pegida-coalition-mass-protest/|accessdate=25 February 2016|work=[[Russia Today]]|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pegida meets with European allies in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.dw.com/en/pegida-meets-with-european-allies-in-the-czech-republic/a-19000895|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advertising-free media''' refers to media outlets whose output is not funded or subsidised by the sale of [[advertising]] space.  It includes in its scope [[mass media]] entities such as [[websites]], [[television]] and [[radio]] networks, and [[magazine]]s.

The [[public broadcaster]]s of a number of countries air without commercials.  Perhaps the best known example of this is the [[United Kingdom]]'s public broadcaster, the [[BBC]], whose domestic networks do not carry commercials.  Instead, the BBC, in common with most other public broadcasters in [[Europe]], is funded by a [[television licence]] fee levied on the owners of all television sets.

A 2006 report by the [[Senate of Canada]] suggested that the country's [[public broadcaster]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], be funded sufficiently by the [[government of Canada|federal government]] so that it could air without any [[advertising]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/ |title=thestar.com&amp;nbsp;— Toronto Star&amp;nbsp;— Canada's largest daily |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006234524/https://www.thestar.com/ |archivedate=2016-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin 019.jpg|thumb|right|310px|[[Amarna letter EA 288|EA 288]], from [[Abdi-Heba]], letter 4 of 6 from [[Jerusalem]]. &lt;br&gt;(very high-resolution expandable photo) ]]

'''Amarna letter EA 286''', titled: ''"A Throne Granted, Not Inherited,"''&lt;ref name="William L 1987, pp. 326-327"&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 286, ''A Throne Granted, Not Inherited'', pp. 326-327.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tall, finely-inscribed [[clay tablet]] letter, approximately 8 in tall, and 3.5 in wide, &lt;!--{{convert|19.5|cm|in|0|}} {{convert|8.5|cm|in|0|}}--&gt; from [[Abdi-Heba]] the mayor/ruler of [[Jerusalem]], of the mid 14th century BC [[Amarna letters]]. The scribe of his six letters to Egypt were penned by the "Jerusalem scribe"; EA 286 is a moderately long, and involved letter.

Unlike similar length letters by the [[Jerusalem scribe]], namely [[Amarna letter EA 287|EA 287]], [[Amarna letter EA 288|EA 288]], and shorter [[Amarna letter EA 289|EA 289]], EA 286 is damaged over the entire surface by erosion, probably from moisture. Other small sections of the [[clay tablet]] letter are missing entirely, with text supplied by the story's context.

&lt;!--The Canaanite [[city-state]]s were visited by the scribes, with short 'status reports' sent to the Pharaoh (King) reporting on city or regional accounts, for example the troubles with the [[habiru]], or other external affairs. Many of the Canaanite letters are short, with some nearly identical phraseology of words, as well as the layout of individual letters. Milkilu authored EA 268 through EA 271. [[Amarna letter EA 270]]-(29 lines) is nearly identical in shape to EA 271-(27 lines), with the beginning lines of the obverse, nearly identical in wording, and spacing.
--&gt;
The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city Akhetaten, in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

Letter EA 286 (see here-(Obverse &amp; Reverse): [https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&amp;ObjectID=P271088]), is numbered VAT 1642, from the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin]].

Lost are all the mayors; there is not a mayor remaining to the king, my lord.'''
:(53-60)--'''May the king turn his attention to the archers so that archers of the king, my lord, come forth. The king has no lands. (That) [[hapiru|'Apiru]]'''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; '''has plundered all the lands of the king. If there are archers this year, the lands of the king, my lord, will remain. But if there are no archers, lost are the lands of the king, my lord.'''
:(61-64)--'''[T]o the scribe of the king, my lord: Message of [[Abdi-Heba]], your [ser]vant. Present eloquent words to the king, my lord. Lost are all the lands of the king, my lord.'''

The '''American way of life''' or simply the '''American way''' is the unique [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] of the [[White American|people]] of the [[United States of America]]. It refers to a [[nationalist ethos]] that adheres to the principle of [[life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness]]. At the center of the American way is the [[American Dream]] that upward mobility is achievable by any American through hard work. This concept is intertwined with the concept of [[American exceptionalism]], the belief in the unique culture of the nation.

Author [[William Herberg]] offers the following definition:&lt;ref&gt;Herberg (1955), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American way of life.jpg|thumb|1937 [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]]. [[Margaret Bourke-White]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-american-way-of-life-172490 ''The American Way of Life'']. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Photograph, gelatin silver print n. 1973.195&lt;/ref&gt; ''There's no way like the American Way'']]

{{quote|The American Way of life is individualistic, dynamic, and pragmatic.  It affirms the supreme value and dignity of the individual; it stresses incessant activity on his part, for he is never to rest but is always to be striving to "get ahead"; it defines an ethic of self-reliance, merit, and character, and judges by achievement: "deeds, not creeds" are what count.  The "American Way of Life" is humanitarian, "forward-looking", optimistic.  Americans are easily the most generous and philanthropic people in the world, in terms of their ready and unstinting response to suffering anywhere on the globe.  The American believes in progress, in self-improvement, and quite fanatically in education.  But above all, the American is idealistic.  Americans cannot go on making money or achieving worldly success simply on its own merits; such "materialistic" things must, in the American mind, be justified in "higher" terms, in terms of "service" or "stewardship" or "general welfare"...  And because they are so idealistic, Americans tend to be moralistic; they are inclined to see all issues as plain and simple, black and white, issues of morality.|William Herberg|''Protestant, Catholic, Jew: an Essay in American religious sociology''}}
{{see|individualism|dignity|humanitarianism|philanthropism|self-improvement|economic materialism|general welfare|moralism|black and white thinking}}

One commentator notes, "The first half of Herberg's statement still holds true nearly half a century after he first formulated it", even though "Herberg's latter claims have been severely if not completely undermined... materialism no longer needs to be justified in high-sounding terms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Flannery O'Connor and the Christ-haunted South |first=Ralph C |last=Wood |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |year=2004 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the National Archives and Records Administration's 1999 Annual Report, National Archivist John W. Carlin writes, "We are different because our government and  our way of life are not based on the divine right of kings, the hereditary privileges of elites, or the enforcement of deference to dictators. They are based on pieces of paper, the Charters of Freedom - the Declaration that asserted our independence, the Constitution that created our government, and the Bill of Rights that established our liberties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/about/plans-reports/performance-accountability/annual/1999/1999-annual-report.html |title=The National Archives and Records Administration Annual Report 1999 |publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancient Pistol''' is a swaggering soldier who appears in three plays by [[William Shakespeare]]. Though full of grandiose boasts about his prowess, he is essentially a coward. The character is introduced in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' and reappears in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.

The character's first name is never given. He is referred to as [[Falstaff]]'s "ancient", meaning "[[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]", or standard bearer.

==''Henry IV, Part 2''==
[[File:Cibber, in the Character of Ancient Pistol (1733).jpg|thumb|[[Theophilus Cibber]] in the role of Pistol]]
Pistol is introduced as a "swaggerer" who suddenly turns up at the Boar's Head Tavern, contrary to the wishes of the hostess, [[Mistress Quickly]]. Falstaff tells her that Pistol is his "ancient" (ensign). He gets into a fight with Falstaff after an exchange of insults with the prostitute [[Doll Tearsheet]], who calls him "the foul-mouth'dst rogue in England".

Later, when Falstaff stops off at [[Justice Shallow]]'s house after the defeat of Scrope, Pistol appears bringing news of the death of Henry IV, asserting that Falstaff is "now one of the greatest men in this realm". In another scene it is revealed that the police are after him because a man he assaulted in tandem with Doll Tearsheet and Mistress Quickly has died. He shares Falstaff's punishment of banishment from the king at the end of the play.

==''The Merry Wives of Windsor''==
Pistol reappears as Falstaff's crony in ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' and is roped into Falstaff's scheme to seduce the wives. He and his colleague [[Corporal Nym]] believe such a scheme beneath their dignity as soldiers, and refuse to participate. Falstaff dismisses them from his service and in revenge they inform the wives' husbands of Falstaff's plan, leading to Falstaff's humiliations at their hands. He also decides to pursue Mistress Quickly. Dressed as a fairy, he participates in the final scene at Herne's Oak.

The phrase "the world's my oyster" derives from one of Pistol's lines in the play, "Why then the world's mine oyster, which I with sword will open."

==''Henry V''==
Pistol plays a major role in ''Henry V''. He marries Mistress Quickly after the death of Falstaff, though it's also implied that he is still involved with Doll Tearsheet. In the war in France, he gets into a feud with the Welsh officer [[Fluellen]], when Fluellen refuses to pardon Pistol's friend [[Bardolph (Shakespeare character)|Bardolph]] who has been caught looting. In the end Fluellen beats him and forces him to eat a raw leek. At Agincourt he becomes involved in comic antics with a French soldier. After the battle he gets a letter from which he learns that "my Doll is dead" from "malady of France", i.e. syphilis (it is unclear whether this refers to Doll Tearsheet or Mistress Quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Andrew Griffin, ''Locating the Queen's Men, 1583–1603'', Ashgate, 2013, p.142&lt;/ref&gt;). He says he intends to desert, return to England and become a pimp and a thief.

==Character role==
[[File:2H4 Q1 TP 1600.jpg|thumb|The title page of ''Henry IV, part 2'', advertising that it contains the "humours of Sir John Falstaff and swaggering Pistol", suggesting that Pistol was a popular character.]] 
Pistol's character may have been derived from the boastful soldier figure [[Il Capitano]], a stock figure in ''commedia del arte'', which also has precedents in Roman comedies, in the ''[[Miles Gloriosus]]'' figure, such as Thraso in [[Terence]]'s ''[[Eunuchus]]''. Pistol is the "Elizabethan version of the ''miles gloriosus'', the braggart soldier from Roman-comedy".&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Cahn, ''Shakespeare the Playwright: A Companion to the Complete Tragedies, Histories, Comedies, and Romances'', Praeger, Westport, 1996. p.468&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible source is the character Piston in [[Thomas Kyd]]'s play ''Soliman and Perseda''.&lt;ref name = "cam"/&gt; There are numerous puns on his name in the plays, with comic reference to his explosive temperament, tendency to misfire, and his unrestrained phallic sexuality ("discharge upon mine hostess").&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wells, Eric Partridge, ''Shakespeare's Bawdy'', Routledge, London, 2001. p.208-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

His bombastic speeches may also be parodies of the self-dramatising heroes of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s plays.&lt;ref name = "cam"&gt;Oscar James Campbell, ''Shakespeare's Satire'': Oxford University Press, London, 1943, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; In his first scene, he (mis)quotes one of Tamburlaine's lines from Marlowe's ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]''. He has an "irresistible impulse to form horrendous speeches out of half-remembered tags from old plays written in 'Cambyses vein.'"&lt;ref name = "jay"&gt;J. Madison Davis, ''The Shakespeare Name and Place Dictionary'', Routledge, 2012, p.387.&lt;/ref&gt; Pistol's florid bombast is often contrasted with the gnomic pronouncements of his colleague Corporal Nym.&lt;ref name = "cam"/&gt;
 
In ''Henry V'' he essentially replicates Falstaff's role in the ''Henry IV'' plays, being the butt of jokes for his empty bluster, while also parodying the rhetoric of the "noble" characters. His role may have been expanded because Falstaff had been killed off.&lt;ref name = "jay"/&gt; His antics with the French soldier are derived from those of the equivalent character (Derick) in Shakespeare's source, ''[[The Famous Victories of Henry V]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, Clayton A. "Shakespeare's Use of The Famous Victories of Henry V," Notes &amp; Queries. n. s. 1 (June 1954): 238–41&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in other works==
Pistol appears in [[William Kenrick (writer)|William Kenrick]]'s play ''[[Falstaff's Wedding]]'' (1766 version), in which he escapes arrest by disguising himself as a Spanish swordsman called Antico del Pistolo, and impresses [[Justice Shallow]]. He competes with Falstaff for the hand of Mistress Ursula, but gets tricked by Shallow into marrying Mistress Quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Kendrick, W., ''Falstaff's Wedding, A Comedy: as it is acted at the theatre Royal in Drury-Lane. Being a sequel to the Second Part of the play of King Henry the Fourth. Written in imitation of Shakespeare''. In magnis voluisse sat est. London. Printed for L. Davis and C. Reyers, in Holborn; and J. Ayan, in Pater-noster-Row. 1766.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James White (1775–1820)|James White]]'s book ''Falstaff's Letters'' (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his cronies, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. Several letters purport to have been written by Pistol in his characteristic florid style.&lt;ref&gt;White, James, ''Falsteff's Letters'', London, Robson, 1877, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three soldier characters in the film ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' are named [[Bardolph (Shakespeare character)|Bardolph]], Nym, and Pistol.

'''Arkaim''' ({{lang-ru|Аркаим}}) is an [[archaeological site]] in Russia, situated in the steppe of the [[Southern Ural]], {{convert|8.2|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} north-to-northwest of the village of Amursky and {{convert|2.3|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} south-to-southeast of the village of Alexandrovsky in the [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] of [[Russia]], just north of the border with [[Kazakhstan]]. It was discovered in 1987 by a team of archaeologists led by [[Gennady Zdanovich]], preventing the planned flooding of the area for the creation of a reservoir.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=33}} Arkaim is attributed to the early [[Proto-Indo-European|Indo-Europeans]] of the [[Sintashta culture]], which some scholars believe represents the proto-[[Indo-Iranians]] before their split into different groups and migration to Central Asia and from there to [[Persia]] and [[India]] and other parts of Eurasia (see [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]]).{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}}

Scholars have identified the structure of Arkaim as the cities built "reproducing the model of the universe" described in ancient Indo-European spiritual literature, the [[Vedas]] and the [[Avesta]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}} The structure consists of three concentric rings of walls and three radial streets, reflecting the city of [[King Yima]] described in the [[Rigveda]].{{sfn|Jones-Bley|Zdanovich|2002|p=45}} The foundation walls and the dwellings of the second ring are built according to ''[[swastika]]''-like patterns;{{sfn|Jones-Bley|Zdanovich|2002|p=163}} the same symbol is found on various artefacts.{{sfn|Jones-Bley|Zdanovich|2002|p=324}} Arkaim is designated as a "national and spiritual shrine" of Russia{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}} and has become a holy site for [[Rodnover]], [[Zoroastrian]] and other religious movements.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=38}}

The fortified citadel of Arkaim dates back to the 17th and 16th century BCE. More than twenty other structures built according to similar patterns have been found in a larger area spanning from the southern Urals' region to the north of Kazakhstan, forming the so-called "[[Country of Towns|Land of Towns]]".{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=34}} Artefacts found at these sites date between the 4th millennium and the 20th century BCE.&lt;ref name=MSU&gt;{{cite web |title=Arkaim the Forgotten Valley |year=2002 |url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp264-ss13/2013/04/24/arkaim-the-forgotten-valley/ |publisher=Michigan State University, Department of Anthropology |website=anthropology.msu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the city of Arkaim was visited by [[Vladimir Putin]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012|pp=27–28}}

==Discovery and salvage of the site==
In the summer of the year 1987 a team of archaeologists headed by [[Gennady Zdanovich]] was sent to examine the archaeological value of the valley at the confluence of the Bolshaya Karaganka and Utyaganka rivers, in the south of [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] or the [[Southern Ural]] region, where the construction of a reservoir had begun the previous autumn. Some archaeological sites in the area were already known, but they had yielded little and were not considered worthy of preservation. The site would have been flooded by the spring of 1988.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=33}}

On June 20, two students who took part in the expedition, Aleksandr Voronkov and Aleksandr Ezril, informed the archaeologists about weird embankments they had found in the steppe. The same evening Zdanovich announced the discovery. The latter would have proven a turning point in the debates about the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|original homeland of the Indo-Europeans]] and their migrations, which [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] specialists had been bitterly disputing about since the 1970s.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=33}} The near [[Sintashta culture]], excavated in that decade, yielded the remains of an early [[chariot]] with horses, making apparent that the southern Urals had been a key location in the development of technology and complex civilisation. The discovery of Arkaim confirmed that assumption.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=34}}

The struggle to rescue the site, was, however, tough, since the reservoir project was carried on by the then all-powerful Ministry of Water Resources of the Soviet Union. The project was scheduled for completion in 1989, but the builders intended to hasten the construction to have it built within the spring of 1988. The archaeologists did their best to mobilise public opinion for the rescue of Arkaim, initially requesting a halt of the project until 1990; academicians and public figures spoke out in their defense. In March 1989 the Praesidium of the Urals Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union formally established a scientific laboratory for the study of the ancient civilisation of Chelyabinsk Oblast, and requested to the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation to declare the site as a protected area of historical value.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}}

In the following months the Ministry of Water Resources rapidly lost power as the Soviet Union moved towards collapse. In April 1991 the Council of Ministers officially cancelled the construction of the reservoir and declared Arkaim a "historical and geographical museum".{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=35}}

==Structure of Arkaim==
[[File:Arkaim Infographic.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Arkaim settlement.]]
Arkaim was a circular stronghold, umbegone by two concentric bastions made of adobe with timber frames, and covered with unburnt clay bricks. Within the circles, close to the bastions, were around sixty dwellings with hearth, cellars, wells and metallurgical furnaces. They opened towards an inner circular street paved with wood. The street was lined by a covered drainage gutter with pits for water collection. At the centre of the complex there was a rectangular open space. The complex had four ingangs, consisting of intricately constructed passages and oriented towards the cardinal points. Evidence suggests that the complex was built according to a plan, which indicates that the society had a developed structure of roles and had leaders with great authority.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=34}}

===Measures===
The settlement covered about {{convert|20000|m2|abbr=off}}. The diameter of the enclosing wall was about {{convert|160|m|abbr=off}}, and its thickness was of {{convert|4|to|5|m|abbr=off}}. The height was of {{convert|5.5|m|ft|2|abbr=off}}. The settlement was surrounded with a {{convert|2|m|abbr=off|adj=on}}-deep moat.

Among the four gates, the main was the western one. The dwellings were between {{convert|110|to|180|m2|sqft|abbr=off}} in area. The dwellings of the outer ring were thirty-nine or forty, with doors opening towards the circular street. The dwellings of the inner ring numbered twenty-seven, arranged along the inner wall, with doors opening towards the central square, which was about {{convert|25|by|27|m|abbr=off}} in area.

Zdanovich estimates that approximately 1,500 to 2,500 people could have lived in Arkaim. Surrounding Arkaim's  walls, were arable fields, 130–140 metres by 45 metres (430–460 feet by 150 feet), irrigated by a system of canals and ditches.

==Social impact==
===Religious movements and mysticism===
[[File:Аркаим Гора Шаманка - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Ritual spirals of stones made by Rodnovers in the areas around Arkaim.]]
{{Further|Slavic Native Faith in Russia}}
The discovery of Arkaim reinvigorated the debate about the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland|original homeland]] of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], seemingly confirming its location in central [[Eurasia]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|pp=33–34}} After their discovery, Arkaim and the Land of Towns have been presented as the "land of the [[Aryan]]s", the centre of a statehood of a [[monarchy|monarchical]] type, and ultimately the model for a new spiritual civilisation harmonised with the universe.{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=1998|1p=36|2a1=Shnirelman|2y=2012|2p=27}} Agencies related to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] have been critical of such activities of Arkaim's archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Petrov |first=Fedor |date=29 June 2010 |title=Наука и неоязычество на Аркаиме (Science and Neopaganism at Arkaim) |website=Proza.ru |url=http://www.proza.ru/2010/05/09/1034 |access-date=3 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707174320/http://www.proza.ru/2010/05/09/1034 |archive-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of Arkaim and the Land of Towns has fueled the growth of schools of thought among [[Rodnovers]], [[Rerikhians]], [[Zoroastrians]] and other movements which regard the archaeological site as the second homeland of the Aryans, who originally dwelt in [[Arctic]] regions and migrated southwards when the weather there became glacial, then spreading from central Eurasia to the east, south and west, founding other civilisations. According to them, all [[Vedas|Vedic]] knowledge originated in the southern Urals.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=37}} Some of them identify Arkaim as the [[Asgard]] of [[Odin]] spoken of in Germanic literature. The Russian Zoroastrian movement started by the Globa family identifies Arkaim as the place where [[Zoroaster]] was born.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=38}} Around the year 2005, a great white ''[[swastika]]'' was carved on the nearest hill, and visitors to the site may buy ''swastika''-shaped medallions.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012|p=28}}

===Vladimir Putin's visit and the "Russian idea"===
Russia's president [[Vladimir Putin]] visited the site in 2005, meeting in person with the chief archaeologist [[Gennady Zdanovich]]. The visit received much attention from Russian media. They presented Arkaim as the "homeland of the majority of contemporary people in Asia, and, partly, Europe". Nationalists called Arkaim the "city of Russian glory" and the "most ancient Slavic-Aryan town". Zdanovich reportedly presented Arkaim to the president as a possible "national idea of Russia",{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012|p=28}} a new idea of civilisation which Shnirelman calls the "Russian idea".{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=36}} According to several analysts, Putin's visit was undoubtedly a message, and it gave credit to the interpretation of Arkaim as an Aryan cult centre.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2012|p=28}}

[[Arthur Conan Doyle]] [[Venerable Order of Saint John|KStJ]], [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (1859–1930) was a Scottish writer and physician. In addition to the [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|series of stories]] chronicling the activities of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and his friend [[Dr. Watson|Dr John Watson]] for which he is well-known, Doyle wrote on a wide range of topics, both fictional and non-fictional.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2004}} In 1876 Doyle entered the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], where he became a pupil of [[Joseph Bell]], whose deductive processes impressed his pupil so much that the teacher became the chief model for Holmes.{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2004}} Doyle began writing while still a student, and in October 1879 he had his first work—"The Mystery of the Sasassa Valley"—published in ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|Chambers's Journal]]''.{{sfn|Lycett|2008|pp=48, 52–53, 65}} He continued writing short works—both fictional and non-fictional—throughout his career, and had over 200 stories and articles published.&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt;

In July 1891 Doyle published the short story "[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]" in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]''—a "story which would change his life", according to his biographer, [[Andrew Lycett]], as it introduced Holmes and Watson to a wide audience; the duo had provided the subject of Doyle's first novel, ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', which was published in ''[[Beeton's Christmas Annual]]'' in 1887. The story in ''The Strand'' was one in a series of six, published in successive months.{{sfn|Lycett|2008|pp=171–72}} They were well received by the public, and the editors of the magazine commissioned a further six stories, and then another series of twelve. Doyle, fearful of having his other work overshadowed by his fictional detective, killed his creation off in December 1893 in "[[The Adventure of the Final Problem]]".{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2004}} He also wrote four full-length Holmes works, as well as adventure novels and nine historical works of fiction. In 1912 he began the adventure series featuring [[Professor Challenger]], who first appeared in ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''—both in short stories and novel form.&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt;

Doyle also wrote four volumes of poetry and a series of stage works—his first was ''Jane Annie'', an unsuccessful attempt at a libretto to an operetta, which he wrote with [[J.M. Barrie]].{{sfn|Lycett|2008|p=196}} Doyle was an enthusiastic supporter of the [[Boer War]], and wrote two histories of the events. During the First World War he also wrote extensively on that conflict, both short articles and a six-volume history. Owing to the close successive deaths of his son and brother, Doyle turned to [[spiritualism]] and wrote extensively on the subject;{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2004}}&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt; his biographer [[Owen Dudley Edwards]] writes that at the time of Doyle's death in July 1930, while the writer "most wanted to be remembered as a champion of spiritualism and as a historical novelist, it is Sherlock Holmes who has continued to capture the imagination of the public."{{sfn|Dudley Edwards|2004}}

{{Calligraphy}}

[[Image:Schriftzug Urkunde.jpg|thumb|Calligraphy of the German word "''Urkunde''" (deed)]]
'''Calligraphy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: καλλιγραφία) is a [[Visual arts|visual art]] related to [[writing]]. It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument,  [[brush]], or other writing instruments.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{rp|17}} A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner".&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{rp|18}}

Modern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not be readable.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Classical calligraphy differs from [[typography]] and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|trans-title=Calligraphy: Intensive Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt|isbn=9783874397001|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie: Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt|isbn=9783874396752|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2007&gt;{{cite book|author=Zapf, H.|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of technical developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester, New York|isbn=9781933360225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Zapf, H.|year=2006|title=The world of Alphabets: A kaleidoscope of drawings and letterforms}} CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt;

Calligraphy continues to flourish in the forms of [[wedding invitations]] and event invitations, [[font]] design and typography, original hand-lettered [[logo]] design, [[religious art]], announcements, [[graphic design]] and commissioned calligraphic art, cut stone [[inscription]]s, and memorial [[document]]s. It is also used for [[Theatrical property|prop]]s and moving images for film and television, and also for [[testimonial]]s, [[birth certificate|birth]] and [[death certificate|death]] certificates, [[map]]s, and other written works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Propfe, J.|year=2005|title=SchreibKunstRaume: Kalligraphie im Raum Verlag|publisher=[[Callwey Verlag]].|location=Munich|isbn=9783766716309|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geddes, A.|author2=Dion, C.|year=2004|title=Miracle: a celebration of new life|publisher=Photogenique Publishers|location=Auckland|isbn= 9780740746963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[File:Pointed pen parts.svg|thumb|A calligraphic [[Nib (pen)|nib]], with part names.]]

The principal tools for a calligrapher are the [[pen]] and the [[paintbrush|brush]]. Calligraphy pens write with [[nib (pen)|nibs]] that may be flat, round, or pointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reaves, M.|author2=Schulte, E.|year=2006|title=Brush Lettering: An instructional manual in Western brush calligraphy|edition=Revised|publisher=Design Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Child|editor-first=H.|year=1985|title=The Calligrapher's Handbook|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Lamb|editor-first=C.M.|origyear=1956|title=Calligrapher's Handbook|publisher=Pentalic|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some decorative purposes, multi-nibbed pens—steel brushes—can be used. However, works have also been created with [[felt-tip pen|felt-tip]] and [[ballpoint pen]]s, although these works do not employ angled lines. There are some styles of calligraphy, such as Gothic script, that require a stub nib pen.

Writing ink is usually water-based and is much less viscous than the oil-based inks used in printing. High quality paper, which has good consistency of absorption,{{clarify|date=October 2013}} enables cleaner lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calligraphyfonts.info/aesthetic-theory-arabic-calligraphy-islamic-art/ |title=Paper Properties in Arabic calligraphy |publisher=calligraphyfonts.info |date= |accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] is often used, as a knife can be used to erase imperfections and a [[light-box]] is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with ''litterea unciales'' (hence the name), and college-[[ruled paper]] often acts as a guideline well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calligraphyislamic.com |title=Calligraphy Islamic website |publisher=Calligraphyislamic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608004825/http://www.calligraphyislamic.com/ |archive-date=2012-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World traditions==

===Europe===
{{Main|Western calligraphy}}
====History====
[[Image:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|Folio 27r from the Lindisfarne Gospels (c.700) contains the [[incipit]] from the [[Gospel of Matthew]].]]
Western calligraphy is recognizable by the use of the [[Latin script]]. The [[Latin alphabet]] appeared about 600 BC, in Rome, and by the first century{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} developed into [[Roman imperial capitals]] carved on stones, [[Rustic capitals]] painted on walls, and [[Roman cursive]] for daily use. In the second and third centuries the [[uncial]] lettering style developed. As writing withdrew to monasteries, uncial script was found more suitable for copying the Bible and other religious texts. It was the monasteries which preserved calligraphic traditions during the fourth and fifth centuries, when the Roman Empire fell and Europe entered the [[Middle Ages|Dark Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabard, V.|author2=Geneslay, V.|author3=Rébéna, L.|title=Calligraphie latine: Initiation|location=, Paris|edition=7th|year=2004|pages=8–11|isbn=978-2215021308|trans-title=Latin calligraphy: Introduction|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the Empire, its power reached as far as Great Britain; when the empire fell, its literary influence remained. The [[Semi-uncial]] generated the Irish Semi-uncial, the small Anglo-Saxon. &lt;ref&gt;Insular Manuscripts: Paleography Section 6: Language on the Page in Insular Manuscripts LAYOUT AND LEGIBILITY. (n.d.). Retrieved May 30, 2018, from https://www.vhmml.org/school/lesson/insular-paleography/layout&lt;/ref&gt; Each region developed its own standards following the main monastery of the region (i.e. [[Merovingian script]], Laon script, [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil script]], [[Visigothic script]], [[Beneventan script]]), which are mostly cursive and hardly readable.

[[Image:Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg|thumb|left|Calligraphy in a [[Latin]] [[Bible]] of 1407 on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], [[Wiltshire]], England. This bible was hand written in Belgium, by Gerard Brils, for reading aloud in a [[monastery]].]]
Christian churches promoted the development of writing through the prolific copying of the Bible, the [[Roman Breviary|Breviary]], and other sacred texts.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 2001a&lt;/ref&gt; Two distinct styles of writing known as uncial and half-uncial (from the Latin "uncia", or "inch") developed from a variety of Roman bookhands.&lt;ref&gt;Knight 1998: 10&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th-9th centuries in northern Europe were the heyday of Celtic illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Durrow, [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Trinity College Library Dublin 2006; Walther &amp; Wolf 2005; Brown &amp; Lovett 1999: 40; Backhouse 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlemagne]]'s devotion to improved scholarship resulted in the recruiting of "a crowd of scribes", according to [[Alcuin]], the Abbot of [[York]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1981: 64&lt;/ref&gt; Alcuin developed the style known as the Caroline or [[Carolingian minuscule]]. The first manuscript in this hand was the Godescalc Evangelistary (finished 783)—a Gospel book written by the scribe Godescalc.&lt;ref&gt;Walther &amp; Wolf 2005; de Hamel 1994: 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; Carolingian remains the one progenitor hand from which modern booktype descends.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 1994: 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eleventh century, the Caroline evolved into the [[blackletter|Gothic script]], which was more compact and made it possible to fit more text on a page.&lt;ref name=lovett2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Lovett, Patricia|title=Calligraphy and Illumination: A History and Practical Guide|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|year=2000|isbn= 978-0810941199}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}} The Gothic calligraphy styles became dominant throughout Europe; and in 1454, when [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed the first printing press in Mainz, Germany, he adopted the Gothic style, making it the first [[typeface]].&lt;ref name=lovett2000 /&gt;{{rp|141}}

[[File:მარიამისეული ქართლის ცხოვრება.JPG|thumb|The [[Georgian calligraphy]] is centuries-old tradition of an artistic writing of the [[Georgian language]] with its [[Georgian scripts|three scripts]].]]
In the 15th century, the rediscovery of old Carolingian texts encouraged the creation of the [[humanist minuscule]] or ''littera antiqua''. The 17th century saw the [[Bastarda|Batarde script]] from France, and the 18th century saw the [[English script (calligraphy)|English script]] spread across Europe and world through their books.

In the mid-1600s French officials, flooded with documents written in various hands and varied levels of skill, complained that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher.  The Office of the Financier thereupon restricted all legal documents to three hands, namely the Coulee, the Rhonde, (known as [[Round hand]] in English) and a Speed Hand sometimes simply called the [[Bastarda]].&lt;ref name="Whalley"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joyce Irene Whalley|title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America|date=c. 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were many great French masters at the time, the most influential in proposing these hands was Louis Barbedor, who published ''Les Ecritures Financière Et Italienne Bastarde Dans Leur Naturel'' circa 1650.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

With the destruction of the [[Camera Apostolica]] during the [[sack of Rome (1527)]], the capitol for writing masters moved to Southern France.  By 1600, the Italic Cursiva began to be replaced by a technological refinement, the Italic Chancery [[Circumflessa]], which in turn fathered the Rhonde and later English [[Roundhand]].&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

In England, [[Philip Ayres (poet)|Ayres]] and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell is noted for his reaction to them, and warnings of restraint and proportionality. Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

====Style====
[[Image:Westerncalligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|Modern Western calligraphy]]
Sacred [[Western calligraphy]] has some special features, such as the illumination of the first letter of each book or chapter in medieval times. A decorative "carpet page" may precede the literature, filled with ornate, geometrical depictions of bold-hued animals. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] (715–720 AD) are an early example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, M.P.|year=2004|title=Painted Labyrinth: The World of the Lindisfarne Gospel|edition=Revised|publisher=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] or [[Islamic calligraphy]], Western calligraphic script employed the use of strict rules and shapes. Quality writing had a rhythm and regularity to the letters, with a "geometrical" order of the lines on the page. Each character had, and often still has, a precise [[stroke order]].

Unlike a typeface, irregularity in the characters' size, style, and colors increases aesthetic value,{{dubious|date=August 2016}} though the content may be illegible. Many of the themes and variations of today's contemporary Western calligraphy are found in the pages of [[The Saint John's Bible]]. A particularly modern example is [[Timothy Botts]]' illustrated edition of the Bible, with 360 calligraphic images as well as a calligraphy [[typeface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible: New Living Translation|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influences====
Several other Western styles use the same tools and practices, but differ by character set and stylistic preferences.
For [[Slavonic lettering]], the history of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] and consequently [[Russia]]n [[writing system]]s differs fundamentally from the one of the [[Latin|Latin language]]. It evolved from the 10th century to today.

The Chinese name for calligraphy is ''{{transl|zh|ISO|shūfǎ}}'' ({{lang|zh|書法}} in Traditional Chinese, literally "the method or law of writing");&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh-TW|書}} (Taiwanese) being here used as in {{lang|yue|楷书}} (Cantonese) or {{lang|zh-TW|楷書}} (Taiwanese), meaning "writing style".{{clarify|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese name ''{{transl|ja|shodō}}'' ({{lang|ja|書道}}, literally "the way or principle of writing"); and the Korean name being ''{{transl|ko|seoye}}'' ({{lang-ko|서예}}/{{lang|ko-Hant|書藝}}, literally "the art of writing"). The calligraphy of [[CJK characters|East Asian characters]] is an important and appreciated aspect of traditional East Asian culture.

In [[ancient China]], the oldest Chinese characters existing are [[Oracle bone script|Jiǎgǔwén  characters]] (甲骨文) carved on ox [[scapula]]e and tortoise [[plastrons]], because the dominators in [[Shang Dynasty]] carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain auspice of military affairs, agricultural harvest, or even procreating and weather. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved. (Keightley, 1978).

In [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]], the graphs on old steles—some dating from 200 BC, and in Xiaozhuan style—are still accessible.

About 220 BC, the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them [[Li Si]]'s character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized ''{{transl|zh|Xiǎozhuàn（小篆）}}'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fazzioli |first=Edoardo |others=Calligraphy by Rebecca Hon Ko |title=Chinese Calligraphy: From Pictograph to Ideogram: The History Of 214 Essential Chinese/Japanese Characters |publisher=[[Abbeville Publishing Group (Abbeville Press, Inc.)|Abbeville Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0896597741 |page=13 |quote=And so the first Chinese dictionary was born, the ''Sān Chāng'', containing {{formatnum:3300}} characters|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, few papers survive from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

The [[Clerical script|Lìshū style]] ({{lang|zh-TW|隸書}}/{{lang|zh|隸书}})(clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, have been also authorised under Qin Shi Huangdi.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6"&gt;{{cite book |author=R.

[[Regular script|Kǎishū style]] (traditional regular script)—still in use today—and attributed to [[Wang Xizhi]] ({{lang|zh|王羲之}}, 303–361) and his followers, is even more regularized.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; Its spread was encouraged by [[Li Siyuan|Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang]] (926–933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed a shape stabilization. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of &lt;big&gt;{{lang|zh|广}}&lt;/big&gt; which is not absolutely the same in the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=zh:康熙字典|trans-title=Kangxi Zidian|year=1716|url=http://ctext.org/library.pl?if=en&amp;res=77358|page=41|language=zh}}.

The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, but old versions, visible on p. 41, clearly allow the stroke order to be determined.&lt;/ref&gt;

Styles which did not survive include Bāfēnshū, a mix made of Xiaozhuan style at 80%, and Lishu at 20%.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;
Some [[variant Chinese character]]s were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, compose the [[Simplified Chinese]] character set.

====Technique====
[[File:Mi Fu-On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|''On Calligraphy'' by [[Mi Fu]], [[Song Dynasty]]]]
Traditional East Asian writing uses the [[Four Treasures of the Study]] ({{lang|zh-TW|文房四寶}}/{{lang|zh|文房四宝}})&lt;ref&gt;Li, J. (Ed.). (n.d.). "Four treasures of Study" tour. Retrieved May 30, 2018, from http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/anhui/travel/2010-06/02/content_9948922.htm&lt;/ref&gt;: the [[ink brush]]es known as máobǐ ({{lang|zh-TW|毛筆}}/{{lang|zh|毛笔}}) to write [[Chinese character]]s, Chinese ink, paper, and inkstone, known as the ''Four Friends of the Study'' ({{lang-ko|문방사우|文房四友}}) in Korea. In addition to these four tools, desk pads and paperweights are also used.

The shape, size, stretch, and [[Brush#Bristles|hair type]] of the ink brush, the color, color density and water density of the ink, as well as the paper's water absorption speed and surface texture are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher's technique also influences the result. The calligrapher's work is influenced by the quantity of ink and water he lets the brush take, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, accelerations, decelerations of the writer's moves, turns, and crochets, and the [[stroke order]] give the "spirit" to the characters, by greatly influencing their final shapes.

=====Styles=====
Cursive styles such as ''[[Semi-cursive script|{{transl|zh|xíngshū}}]]'' ({{lang|zh-TW|行書}}/{{lang|zh|行书}})(semi-cursive or running script) and ''[[Grass script|{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}]]'' ({{lang|zh-TW|草書}}/{{lang|zh|草书}})(cursive, rough script, or grass script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, in the same time as Regular script ([[Han Dynasty]]), but ''{{transl|zh|xíngshū}}'' and ''{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}'' were used for personal notes only, and never used as a standard. The ''{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}''  style was highly appreciated in [[Emperor Wu of Han]] reign (140–187 AD).&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;

Examples of modern printed styles are [[Ming (typeface)|Song]] from the [[Song Dynasty]]'s [[Four Great Inventions of ancient China#Printing|printing press]], and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]]. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.

Both Japanese and Korean calligraphy were greatly influenced by Chinese calligraphy. The Japanese and Korean people have also developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences. For example, [[Japanese calligraphy]] go out of the set of [[CJK strokes]] to also include local alphabets such as [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], with specific problematics such as new curves and moves, and specific materials ([[Japanese paper]], ''{{transl|ja|washi}}'' {{lang|ja|和紙}}, and Japanese ink).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Yuuko|title=An introduction to Japanese calligraphy|year=2005|publisher=Search|location=Tunbridge Wells|isbn=978-1844480579}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Korean calligraphy]], the [[Hangeul]] and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique which usually confuses Chinese calligraphers.

Temporary calligraphy is a practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor, which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks of China. These will often open studio-shops in tourist towns offering traditional Chinese calligraphy to tourists. Other than writing the clients name, they also sell fine brushes as souvenirs and lime stone carved stamps.

Since late 1980s, a few Chinese artists have branched out traditional Chinese calligraphy to a new territory by mingling [[Chinese characters]] with English letters; notable new forms of calligraphy are [[Xu Bing]]'s square calligraphy and DanNie's coolligraphy or cooligraphy.

[[Mongolian calligraphy]] is also influenced by Chinese calligraphy, from tools to style.

Calligraphy has influenced [[ink and wash painting]], which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in [[East Asia]], including [[ink and wash painting]], a style of [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Japanese painting|Japanese]], and [[Korean painting|Korean]] based entirely on calligraphy.

The Philippines has numerous indigenous scripts collectively called as [[suyat]]. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various mediums. By the end of colonialism, only four of the suyat scripts survived and continue to be used by certain communities in everyday life. These four scripts are [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]] of the Hanuno'o [[Mangyan]] people, [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]] of the Buhid [[Mangyan]] people, [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]] of the [[Tagbanwa people]], and [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]] of the [[Palawan people|Palaw'an people]]. All four scripts were inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme]], under the name ''Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan)'', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/philippine-paleographs-hanunoo-buid-tagbanua-and-palawan/|title=Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan) – United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bayi, a bamboo bow from Mindoro.jpg|thumb|left|Bow with [[Hanunó'o alphabet|Hanunó'o calligraphy]]]]
Due to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of [[suyat]] scripts that went extinct due to Spanish persecution. These scripts being revived include the [[Kulitan alphabet|kulitan]] script of the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan people]], the [[Visayan languages|badlit]] script of various [[Visayan languages|Visayan ethnic groups]], the [[Eskaya|iniskaya]] script of the [[Eskaya people]], the [[baybayin]] script of the [[Tagalog people]], and the [[Ilocano language|kur-itan]] script of the [[Ilocano people]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/201104-baybayin-national-writing-system-reactions|title=‘Educate first’: Filipinos react to Baybayin as national writing system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1602707/Manila/Local-News/House-panel-approves-Baybayin-as-national-writing-system|title=House panel approves Baybayin as national writing system|date=24 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/25/18/5-things-to-know-about-phs-pre-hispanic-writing-system|title=5 things to know about PH's pre-Hispanic writing system|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the diversity of [[suyat]] scripts, all calligraphy written in [[suyat]] scripts are collectively called as Filipino suyat calligraphy, although each are distinct from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2018/04/26/baybayin-bill.html|title=The Baybayin bill and the never ending search for ‘Filipino-ness’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy using the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are also prevalent in the Philippines due to its colonial past, but the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are not considered as suyat, and therefore Western-alphabet and Arabic calligraphy are not considered as suyat calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brideandbreakfast.ph/2015/08/12/awesome-calligraphers/|title=10 Perfectly Awesome Calligraphers You Need To Check Out|author=|date=12 August 2015|website=brideandbreakfast.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/2018/06/01/1820721/watch-how-ace-script-lettering|title=WATCH: How to ace in script lettering - Philstar.com|author=|date=|website=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanskrit]] is the primary form of Thai calligraphy. Historically Thai calligraphy has been limited to sacred texts of the Pali Canon with few wider artistic applications where graphic calligraphy representing figures and objects is produced. Calligraphy appears on the personal flag of each member of the Thai royal family  bearing its owner's initials in calligraphy. The most obvious place in the country where calligraphy is present is in graffiti. A few books have been published with calligraphic compositions.

Vietnamese calligraphy uses a variety of scripts, including Chinese characters, Chữ nôm, and the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ. Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts. Due to the adoption of the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy uses Roman characters. Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China for historical and geographic regions. As part of the East Asian cultural sphere, Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy’s standard and use Han script (Chinese language) in many of its writings. In modern times, calligraphy has been done mainly in the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ script, as Chữ nôm and Chinese characters have largely fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnamese neglect Han-Nom heritage|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/sunday/features/220749/vietnamese-neglect-han-nom-heritage.html|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=Viet Nam News|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aśoka]]'s edicts (c. 265–238 BC) were committed to stone. These inscriptions are stiff and angular in form. Following the Aśoka style of Indic writing, two new calligraphic types appear: [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭī]] and [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]]. Kharoṣṭī was used in the northwestern regions of India from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century of the Christian Era, and it was used in [[Central Asia]] until the 8th century.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In many parts of ancient India, the inscriptions were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves. This tradition dates back to over two thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=10660&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Memory of the World &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020103635/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D10660%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html# |archive-date=2016-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the Indian languages were put on paper in the 13th century, palm leaves where considered a preferred medium of writing owing to its longevity (nearly 400 years) compared to paper. Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered on top of one another, holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to [[Southeast Asia]]. The palm leaf was an excellent surface for penwriting, making possible the delicate lettering used in many of the scripts of southern Asia.

====Nepal====
{{Main|Nepalese calligraphy}}
[[Ranjana script]] is the primary form of Nepalese calligraphy. The script itself, along with its derivatives (like [[Lanydza Script|Lantsa]], [['Phags-pa script|Phagpa]], [[Kutila]]) are used in [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Leh]], [[Mongolia]], coastal Japan, and Korea to write "[[Om mani padme hum]]" and other sacred [[Buddhist texts]], mainly those derived from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]].

====Tibet====
{{Main|Tibetan calligraphy}}
[[Image:BonpoBook.jpg|thumb|A [[Bön]] text]]

Calligraphy is central in [[Tibet]]an culture. The script is derived from [[Indic script]]s. The nobles of Tibet, such as the High [[Lama]]s and inhabitants of the [[Potala Palace]], were usually capable calligraphers. [[Tibet]] has been a center of [[Buddhism]] for several centuries, and that religion places a great deal of significance on written word. This does not provide for a large body of [[secular]] pieces, although they do exist (but are usually related in some way to Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all high religious writing involved calligraphy, including letters sent by the [[Dalai Lama]] and other religious and secular authority. Calligraphy is particularly evident on their [[prayer wheels]], although this calligraphy was forged rather than scribed, much like Arab and Roman calligraphy is often found on buildings. Although originally done with a reed, Tibetan calligraphers now use chisel tipped pens and markers as well.

===Islamic world===
{{Main|Islamic calligraphy}}
[[File:Basmalah-1wm.svg|left|thumb|The phrase [[Basmala|Bismillah]] in an 18th-century Islamic calligraphy from the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] region.]]
Islamic calligraphy (''calligraphy'' in Arabic is ''{{transl|ar|khatt ul-yad}}'' {{rtl-lang|ar|خط اليد}}) has evolved alongside [[Islam]] and the [[Arabic language]]. As it is based on Arabic letters, some call it "Arabic calligraphy". However the term "Islamic calligraphy" is a more appropriate term as it comprises all works of calligraphy by the Muslim calligraphers from [[Andalusia]] in modern [[Spain]] to China.

Islamic calligraphy is associated with geometric Islamic art ([[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]) on the walls and ceilings of [[mosque]]s as well as on the page. Contemporary artists in the [[Islamic world]] draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions.

Instead of recalling something related to the spoken word, calligraphy for [[Muslim]]s is a visible expression of the highest art of all, the art of the [[spirituality|spiritual]] world. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The [[Qur'an]] has played an important role in the development and evolution of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and passages from the Qur'an are still sources for Islamic calligraphy.

It is generally accepted that Islamic calligraphy excelled during the [[Ottoman era]].{{By whom|date=December 2016}} Istanbul is an open exhibition hall for all kinds and varieties of calligraphy, from inscriptions in mosques to fountains, schools, houses, etc. {{Clear}}

===Ethiopia/Abyssinia===
[[File:Ethiopian Scroll comprising prayers against various ailments Wellcome L0031387.jpg|thumb|upright|A painting of [[Susenyos I]] (r. 1607-1632)on a [[Ge'ez]] prayer scroll meant to dispel evil spirits, [[Wellcome Collection]], London]]

[[Ethiopian]] (Abyssinian)) calligraphy began with the [[Ge'ez script]], which replaced Epigraphic [[South Arabian]] in the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], that was developed specifically for [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]]. In those languages that use it, such as [[Amharic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], the script is called ''{{transl|sem|Fidäl}}'', which means script or alphabet. The Epigraphic South Arabian letters were used for a few inscriptions into the 8th century, though not any South Arabian language since [[Dʿmt]].

Early inscriptions in Ge'ez and Ge'ez script have been dated to as early as the 5th century BC, and in a sort of proto-Ge'ez written in ESA since the 9th century BC. Ge'ez literature begins with the Christianization of Ethiopia (and the civilization of Axum) in the 4th century, during the reign of [[Ezana of Axum]]. 

The Ge'ez script is read from left to right and has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for [[Amharic language|Amharic]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] in [[Eritrea]] and Ethiopia.

===Persia===
{{Main|Persian calligraphy}}

[[Image:Nastaliq-proportions.jpg|thumb|Example showing Nastaliq's proportional rules]]

The history of calligraphy in [[Persia]] dates back to the pre-Islam era. In [[Zoroastrianism]] beautiful and clear writings were always praised.

It is believed that [[Old Persian|ancient Persian script]] was invented by about 600–500 BC to provide monument inscriptions for the [[Achaemenid Empire#Achaemenid kings and rulers|Achaemenid kings]]. These scripts consisted of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal nail-shape letters, which is why it is called [[Cuneiform script|"script of nails/cuneiform script"]] (''{{transl|fa|khat-e-mikhi}}'') in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Centuries later, other scripts such as "[[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]]" and "[[Avestan script|Avestan]]" scripts were used in ancient Persia.









==== Contemporary scripts ====
The [[Nasta'liq script|Nasta'liq]] style is the most popular contemporary style among classical Persian calligraphy scripts; Persian calligraphers call it the "bride of calligraphy scripts". This calligraphy style has been based on such a strong structure that it has changed very little since. [[Mir Ali Tabrizi]] had found the optimum composition of the letters and graphical rules so it has just been fine-tuned during the past seven centuries. It has very strict rules for graphical shape of the letters and for combination of the letters, words, and composition of the whole calligraphy piece.

===Mayan civilization===
Mayan calligraphy was expressed via [[Mayan hieroglyphs]]; modern Mayan calligraphy is mainly used on [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and monuments in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in Mexico. Mayan hieroglyphs are rarely used in government offices; however in [[Campeche]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and [[Quintana Roo]], Mayan calligraphy is written in Latin letters.{{clarify|date=August 2016}} Some commercial companies in southern Mexico use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their business. Some community associations and modern Mayan brotherhoods use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their groups.

Most of the archaeological sites in Mexico such as [[Chichen Itza]], Labna, [[Uxmal]], [[Edzna]], [[Calakmul]], etc. have glyphs in their structures. Carved stone monuments known as [[stele]] are common sources of ancient Mayan calligraphy.

==Modern calligraphy==

===Revival===
[[File:Edward Johnston.png|thumb|[[Edward Johnston]], founder of modern western calligraphy, at work in 1902.]]
After [[printing]] became ubiquitous from the 15th century, the production of illuminated manuscripts began to decline.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 2001a; de Hamel 1986&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise of printing did not mean the end of calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Zapf 2007; de Hamel 2001a; Gilderdale 1999; Gray 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern revival of calligraphy began at the end of the 19th century, influenced by the aesthetics and philosophy of [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. [[Edward Johnston]] is regarded as being the father of modern calligraphy.&lt;ref name="ejf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejf.org.uk/|title=The Legacy of Edward Johnston|publisher=The Edward Johnston Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cockerell 1945; Morris 1882&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Font Designer — Edward Johnston|publisher=Linotype GmbH|url=http://www.linotype.com/733/edwardjohnston.html|accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After studying published copies of manuscripts by architect [[William Harrison Cowlishaw]], he was introduced to [[William Lethaby]] in 1898, principal of the [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Arts and Crafts]], who advised him to study manuscripts at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;such as the Ramsey Psalter, BL, Harley MS 2904&lt;/ref&gt;

This triggered Johnston's interest in the art of calligraphy with the use of a broad edged pen. He began a teaching course in calligraphy at the Central School in [[Southampton Row]], London from September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor [[Eric Gill]]. He was commissioned by  [[Frank Pick]] to design a [[Johnston (typeface)|new typeface]] for [[London Underground]], still used today (with minor modifications).&lt;ref&gt;The Eric Gill Society: [https://web.archive.org/web/20081010172820/http://www.ericgill.org.uk/associates/edward-johnston-1872-1944 Associates of the Guild: Edward Johnston]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been credited for reviving the art of modern [[penmanship]] and lettering single-handedly through his books and teachings - his handbook on the subject, ''Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering'' (1906) was particularly influential on a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including [[Graily Hewitt]], [[Stanley Morison]], [[Eric Gill]], [[Alfred Fairbank]] and Anna Simons. Johnston also devised the simply crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the ''Foundational hand''. Johnston initially taught his students an uncial hand using a flat pen angle, but later taught his hand using a slanted pen angle.&lt;ref&gt;Gilderdale 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He first referred to this hand as "Foundational Hand" in his 1909 publication, ''Manuscript &amp; Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen''.&lt;ref&gt;Baines &amp; Dixon 2003: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
[[Graily Hewitt]] taught at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and published together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century. Hewitt was central to the revival of [[gilding]] in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943. He is attributed with the  revival of  gilding with [[gesso]] and gold leaf on [[vellum]]. Hewitt helped to found the [[Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators]] (SSI) in 1921, probably the world's foremost calligraphy society.

Hewitt is not without both critics&lt;ref&gt;Tresser 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and supporters&lt;ref&gt;Whitley 2000: 90&lt;/ref&gt; in his rendering of [[Cennino Cennini]]'s medieval gesso recipes.&lt;ref&gt;Herringham 1899&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Jackson (calligrapher)|Donald Jackson]], a British calligrapher, has sourced his gesso recipes from earlier centuries a number of which are not presently in English translation.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1981: 81&lt;/ref&gt; Graily Hewitt created the patent announcing the award to [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] of the title of Duke of Edinburgh on November 19, 1947, the day before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt 1944-1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston’s pupil, [[Anna Simons]], was instrumental in sparking off interest in calligraphy in Germany with her German translation of ''Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering'' in 1910.&lt;ref name="ejf" /&gt; Austrian [[Rudolf Larisch]], a teacher of lettering at the Vienna School of Art, published six lettering books that greatly influenced German-speaking calligraphers. Because German-speaking countries had not abandoned the Gothic hand in printing, Gothic also had a powerful effect on their styles.

[[Rudolf Koch]] was a friend and younger contemporary of Larisch. Koch's books, type designs, and teaching made him one of the most influential calligraphers of the 20th century in northern Europe and later in the U.S. Larisch and Koch taught and inspired many European calligraphers, notably [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]], and [[Hermann Zapf]].&lt;ref&gt;Cinamon 2001; Kapr 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary typefaces used by computers, from word processors like [[Microsoft Word]] or [[Apple Pages]] to professional designers' software like [[Adobe InDesign]], owe a considerable debt to the past and to a small number of professional typeface designers today.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Mediaville|first=Claude|title=Calligraphy: From Calligraphy to Abstract Painting|year=1996|publisher=Scirpus-Publications|location=Belgium|isbn=9080332518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henning, W.E.|year=2002|title=An Elegant Hand: The Golden Age of American Penmanship and Calligraphy|editor-last=Melzer|editor-first=P.|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, Delaware|isbn=978-1584560678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation-restoration of the ''[[H.L. Hunley]]''''' is currently being undertaken by the [[Warren Lasch Conservation Center]]; they hope to have the ''Hunley'' project completed by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephenson|first1=Frank|title=A fresh look at the H.L.

The ''Hunley'', the first combat submarine to successfully complete its mission, has been at the Lasch Conservation Center for over 15 years while scientist and conservators formulate a plan for its restoration. Once the ''Hunley''{{’}}s conservation and restoration is complete it will be relocated to a new museum built in its honor on the former Navy base in North Charleston. Currently visitors can tour the conservation center laboratories and can view the ''Hunley'' in its 75,000-gallon tank.

==History and sinking of the ''H.L. Hunley''==
{{main article|Sinking of USS Housatonic}}
''H.L. Hunley'' is a civil war confederate submarine built in 1863 by Park &amp; Lyons; Hunley, McClintock &amp; Weston. Its length is 39.5 ft. and its beam is 3.83 ft. and it had a speed of four [[Knot (unit)|knots]]. It was propelled by a hand cranked propeller and held a crew of one officer and seven enlisted men. Its armament carried one spar torpedo. The ''Hunley'' sank three times during its short career. The first two times were during test runs, and the final time was during its attack of the {{USS|Housatonic|1861}}. The ''Hunley'' was lost to the Charleston outer harbor until 1995 and was finally recovered in 2000.

On February 17, 1864, the ''Hunley'' destroyed the Union sloop ''Housatonic'' outside the Charleston Harbor. The ''Hunley'' was too close to the ''Housatonic'' when they exploded the torpedo. The Hunley was mounted with a “spar-mounted torpedo loaded with 135 pounds of gunpowder”. After the ''Hunley'' had rammed the ''Housatonic'' and embedded the torpedo in her hull, the ''Hunley'' reversed course while the lanyard connected to the torpedo fuse was tightened and exploded. The ''Housatonic'' sank immediately; however, the ''Hunley'' did not sink so quickly. Evidence shows that the ''Hunley'' may have survived up to an hour after the detonation of the torpedo on the ''Housatonic''.

==Discovery and recovery of the ''H.L. Hunley''==
[[File:Location of the Hunley.png|thumb|Location of the ''Hunley'' submarine]]
The ''H.L. Hunley'' was found in 1995 in the Charleston outer harbor about four miles off Sullivan’s island. The divers had to dive down 30 feet of water before finding the ''Hunley'', which was buried in the sand and sediment. There is some controversy about who located the actual position of the ''Hunley''. Well-known author [[Clive Cussler]] and underwater archaeologist [[E. Lee Spence]] both claim to have made the original discovery. Cussler claims to have discovered it in 1995, and Spence says he discovered it in 1970 but failed to validate the discovery by diving in the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Confederate Submarine H.L. Hunley|url=http://shipwrecks.com/hunley_discovery/|website=Shipwrecks|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSSHLHunleyrecovery.jpg|thumb|''H.L. Hunley'' recovery]]
The ''Hunley'' was sent to Lasch Conservation Center at the old Charleston Navy Yard for conservation. The remains of the eight crewmen serving on the ''Hunley'' when it sank were found and buried on April 17, 2004, at the [[Magnolia Cemetery (Charleston, South Carolina)|Magnolia Cemetery]] in Charleston. The recovery and conservation of the ''H.L. Hunley'' was championed by South Carolina Senator [[Glenn F. McConnell|Glenn McConnell]]. He asked Warren Lasch to take on the fundraising and oversee the conservation and restoration treatment of the ''Hunley''. Lasch accepted the challenge in 1997 and became the chairman of the Friends of the Hunley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search and Recovery|url=https://hunley.org/the-search-and-recovery/|website=Friends of the Hunley|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of deterioration present on the ''H.L. Hunley''==
[[File:Rust on iron.jpg|thumb|Rust on iron]]

===Rust===
[[Rust]] occurs naturally when iron or steel is submerged in water and exposed to oxygen. It can also occur when the moisture content of the air surrounding the metal is high. Because the ''H.L. Hunley'' was made of iron and was submerged for over a hundred years, rust had formed all over the submarine. However, to prevent more rust from forming, the conservators choose to keep the ''H.L. Hunley'' submerged in a water tank, instead of exposing it to the oxygen-rich air, until a full conservation plan could be created.

===Metal Fatigue===
[[Fatigue (material)|Metal Fatigue (Stress and Corrosion)]] can be either from stress or corrosion. Stress fatigue occurs when the metal is repeatedly pushed back and forth, such as from water pressure. This pressure eventually cause tiny cracks to form in the metal. Corrosion fatigue happens when the cracks in the metal becomes corrosive and weaken the structure. Thus normal wear and tear can cause metal fatigue.

===Causes of deterioration===

[[File:Hunley 001.jpg|thumb|''Hunley'']]

====Salt Water====
The combination of salt water and metal can cause several types of [[corrosion]], electrochemical corrosion and anaerobic corrosion. Electrochemical corrosion happens because the metal ions attract other compounds, which then cause the salt in the water to attack the metal. Anaerobic corrosion occurs when sulfate deposits surround the submerged metal and start producing hydrogen sulfide, which corrodes metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Bailey|title=The Effects of Saltwater on Metals|url=http://sciencing.com/effects-saltwater-metals-8632636.html|website=Sciencing|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''H.L. Hunley'' sank in the outer harbor of Charleston, the salt water had over a hundred years to eat through the metal.

====Air/oxygen====
Iron artifacts from the sea in particular are susceptible to rapid deterioration when exposed to an oxygen-rich environment like air. Chlorides from the seawater penetrate the iron on the molecular level. When in solution, these chlorides present no real problem. However, when exposed to air, they slowly dry in crystal form. As the crystals grow, the surface of the metal will expand and flake away, eventually reducing the artifact to a pile of iron oxide dust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation|url=https://hunley.org/conservation/|website=Friends of the Hunley|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the iron oxide dust is called rust. Rust occurs naturally on iron when it has been submerged for a while and is exposed to oxygen.

====Concretion====
Concretion is an encrusted layer of sand, sediment and shells that builds up slowly, when an object is submerged in water. Over time, marine organisms colonize on the submerged metal and build up layers of calcium. These layers create a barrier for a micro environment on the surface of the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron corrosion &amp; Concretion formation|url=http://www.clihouston.com/news/iron-corrosion-concretion-formation.html|website=CLI Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments of deterioration==
===Timeline of conservation and restoration===
* August 2000: ''Hunley'' raised from the sea
* February 2001: Several hull plates are removed
* March 2001: First artifacts are found
* April 2001: First human remains are uncovered
* September 2001: Second Phase of conservation and restoration begins
* January 2002: Third Phase begins, studies on the human remains and excavation of the block lifts
* 2003: Fourth Phase begins, excavation of the ballast tanks
* 2008: 3-D scanning of the exterior surface
* June 2011:  ''Hunley'' is rotated to an upright position
* May 2014: ''Hunley'' is lowered into the 75,000 gallon tank, designed to remove the salt from the metal
* 2014-2015: Removal of the outer concretion
* 2016: Removal of the interior concretion

===Rotation===
The ''Hunley'' was removed from its watery grave at a 45-degree angle in order to keep the interior contents from shifting and falling through a weaken section of the hull. The ''Hunley'' had been lying at 45-degree angle on the sea floor for more than a hundred years. To lift the civil war submarine from the ocean, several slings were attached to the underside of the submarine and then slowly lifted from the water. 

Once the submarine was relocated to the Lasch Conservation Center, it was left in the slings at a 45-degree angle until the hull plates and keel blocks were removed, eleven tons of sediment had been cleaned out of the interior and a engineering and strength evaluation could be completed. Once the evaluation was completed and the ''Hunley'' was deemed safe to move, it took three days in June of 2011 to turn the civil war submarine upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Brian|title=Righting the Hunley: Sub's move begins Wednesday, with rotation next week|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/righting-the-hunley-sub-s-move-begins-wednesday-with-rotation/article_ba49de16-4a52-589c-8d31-55cfcb2d1037.html|website=The Post and Courier|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservators also used sensors, located on the keel support, to monitor the weight on each bearing. This was done so that the conservators can make sure the weight of the submarine is being supported evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Bruce|title=Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley hull being revealed after almost 150 years|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700145372/Confederate-submarine-HL-Hunley-hull-being-revealed-after-almost-150-years.html|website=Associated Press|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concretion removal===
When the ''Hunley'' was brought to the Lasch Conservation Center, it had over 1,200 pounds of concretion on its outer hull, that is equal to the weight of a large grizzly bear. In some places on the hull the concretion was over an inch thick. To remove the concretion, conservators spent many hours slowly chiseling the concretion off, using pneumatic chisels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephenson|first1=Frank|title=A fresh look at the H.L. Hunley|url=http://thetandd.com/news/a-fresh-look-at-the-h-l-hunley/article_0e9e261e-8736-11e6-a3aa-3fdd6b2bc384.html|website=T&amp;D|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took conservators over a year to remove all the concretion from the outer hull. Currently the conservators have finished removing the concretion from the outside and are working on the interior. It will take at least another year to remove the interior concretion, perhaps a little longer since the conservators have to work in the small interior space of the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hull of Confederate sub H.L. Hunley _ first to sink enemy warship _ cleaned and revealed|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/09/17/hull-confederate-sub-hl-hunley-first-to-sink-enemy-warship-cleaned-and-revealed.html|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing the concretion that has built up allows researchers to analyze why the ''Hunley'' sank and if the holes they have found in the outer hull of the submarine were from the ''Housantonic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gast|first1=Phil|title=The Hunley: Zeroing in on what caused Civil War submarine's sinking|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/14/travel/civil-war-submarine-hunley/|website=CNN|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Submersion===
After the ''Hunley'' was recovered  it was placed in a 75,000-gallon tank. This was in order to protect the ''Hunley'' from the deterioration properties of oxygen. If it was left out in the open air, it would immediately begin to rust and deteriorate rapidly. By placing the ''Hunley'' in the tank, consisting of water and a solution of [[sodium hydroxide]], conservators had bought some time to formulate a conservation plan. "During treatment, the ''Hunley'' will be constantly monitored and once the chemical bath is saturated with the salts it has leached from the submarine, it will be drained from the tank, neutralized, and replaced with a fresh solution.  This process, which is estimated to take approximately 5-7 years, will be repeated until the level of salt in the iron is low enough to allow the ''Hunley'' to be rescued from its delicate and dangerous state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conservation |date=n.d. |access-date=March 20, 2017 |url=https://hunley.org/conservation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the guideline that Wikipedia is not a crystal ball|WP:CRYSTALBALL}}
[[Image:John William Waterhouse - The Crystal Ball.JPG|thumb|''[[The Crystal Ball (painting)|The Crystal Ball]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]].]]
A '''crystal ball''', also known as an '''orbuculum''', is a [[crystal]] or [[glass]] ball and common [[fortune telling]] object.{{efn|Sometimes further referred to as a ''shew stone'' (or ''show stone'' {{ndash}} "shew" is an archaic spelling of "show").}} It is generally associated with the performance of [[clairvoyance]] and [[scrying]] in particular.

==History==
The earliest use of a crystal ball can be first attributed to the Celtic [[Druid]]s who divined the future and omens with [[beryl]] balls.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sibyl Ferguson|title=Crystal Ball: Stones, Amulets, And Talismans For Power, Protection, and Prophecy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4V0x3_K98_wC&amp;pg=PA59|date=30 June 2005|publisher=Weiser Books|isbn=978-1-57863-348-7|pages=59–60, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1st century AD, [[Pliny the Elder]] describes use of crystal balls by [[Fortune-telling|soothsayers]] (''"crystallum orbis"'', later written in [[Medieval Latin]] by scribes as ''orbuculum'').&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Elder|title=Caii Plinii Secundi Historiæ naturalis libri xxxvii, cum selectis comm. J. Harduini ac recentiorum interpretum novisque adnotationibus|date=1831|page=579|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNkIAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22orbis+crystallum%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=7 November 2015}} {{La icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 5th century AD, scrying was widespread within the [[Roman Empire]] and was condemned by the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|early medieval Christian Church]] as [[Christian views on magic|heretical]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal gazing|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/crystal-gazing|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] was a noted British mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and consultant to [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. He devoted much of his life to alchemy, divination, and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] philosophy, of which the use of crystal balls was often included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ensemble.va.com.au/tableau/suzy/TT_ResearchProjects/Hexen2039/JohnDee/JD_CBall.html John Dee's Crystal Ball]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal gazing was a popular pastime in the [[Victorian era]], and was claimed to work best when the Sun is at its northernmost declination. Immediately before the appearance of a vision, the ball was said to mist up from within.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Art of scrying==
{{main article|Scrying|Crystal gazing}}
[[Image:Glaskugel CrystalBall.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of a [[quartz]] crystal ball of the type commonly used for [[divination]] or [[scrying]]]]
The art or process of "seeing" is known as "[[scrying]]", whereby images are claimed to be seen in crystals, or other media such as water, and are interpreted as meaningful information. The "information" gleaned then is used to make important decisions in one's life (i.e. love, marriage, finances, travel, business, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Chauran, Alexandra. Crystal Ball Reading for Beginners: A Down To Earth Guide. Woodbury, Minnesota: Llewellyn Publications, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the technique of scrying is used with crystals, or any transparent body, it is known as crystallomancy or [[crystal gazing]].

==In stage magic==
Crystal balls are popular props used in [[mentalism]] acts by [[magic (illusion)|stage magicians]]. Such routines, in which the performer answers audience questions by means of various ruses, are known as crystal gazing acts. One of the most famous performers of the 20th century, [[Alexander (magician)|Claude Alexander]], was often billed as "Alexander the Crystal Seer".

A crystal ball is essentially a bi-convex [[spherical lens]] with a uniform [[radius of curvature]], although without its edges and center material truncated as in a conventional lens construction.  Thus the principles of [[optics]] may be applied to analyze its imaging characteristics.

As a lens, a transparent sphere of any material with [[refractive index]] greater than one bends rays of light to a [[focus (optics)|focal point]].  An image is formed with significant [[coma (optics)|coma]], [[field curvature]], and other [[optical aberrations]] inherent to spherical lenses. The refractive index of typical materials used for crystal balls (quartz: 1.46, window glass: 1.52), produces a central focal point just outside the surface of the sphere, on the side diametrically opposite to where the rays entered.

For materials with refractive index greater than 2, the focus will be located inside the sphere.  In this case the image is not directly accessible, while the closest accessible point is on its surface directly opposite the source of light. However, [[List of refractive indices|few materials]] have a refractive index this high. For a refractive index of 2, the image forms on the surface of the sphere, and the image may be viewed on an translucent object or diffusing coating on the imaging side of the sphere.

Since a crystal ball has no edges like a conventional lens, the image-forming properties are omnidirectional (independent of the direction being imaged). This effect is exploited in the [[Campbell–Stokes recorder]], a scientific instrument which records the brightness of sunlight by burning the surface of a paper card bent around the sphere.  The device, itself fixed, records the apparent motion and intensity of the sun across the sky, burning an image of the sun's motion across the card.

The omnidirectional [[burning glass]] effect can occur with a crystal ball that is brought into full sunlight.  The image of the sun formed by a large crystal ball will burn a hand that is holding it, and can ignite dark-coloured flammable material placed near it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61176-2004Jan29.html|title=Crystal Ball Starts Fire at Okla. Home|last=Associated Press|date=29 January 2004|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ball lens]]es such as are used to couple [[fiber optics]] are identical to crystal balls, but in tiny form, commonly 1mm to 10mm in diameter.

==Famous crystal balls in history==
A crystal ball lies in the [[Honours of Scotland|Sceptre of Scotland]] that is said to have been originally possessed by pagan druids.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sibyl Ferguson|title=Crystal Ball: Stones, Amulets, And Talismans For Power, Protection, and Prophecy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4V0x3_K98_wC&amp;pg=PA59|date=30 June 2005|publisher=Weiser Books|isbn=978-1-57863-348-7|pages=59–60, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philadelphia]]'s [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] (also called ''Penn Museum'' for short) displays the third largest crystal ball&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/collections/object/335728|title=Crystal Sphere|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the central object in its [[Chinese art|Chinese]] [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]]. Weighing 49 pounds, the [[sphere]] is made of [[quartz crystal]] from [[Burma]] and was shaped through years of constant rotation in a semi-cylindrical container filled with [[emery (rock)|emery]], [[Garnet|garnet powder]], and [[water]]. The ornamental treasure was purportedly made for the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] (1835-1908) during the [[Qing dynasty]] in the 19th century, but no evidence as to its actual origins exists.

There's an audio game built into the [[Google Assistant]] on which tells the player to "Ask a Yes or No Question". The voice starts with an intro that says this line in a dramatic voice: "Come closer. Closer. Closer. Ok Stop. Close your eyes and open your mind. The Crystal Ball shall reveal the truth. Now ask a Yes or No Question." Then after the user asks a question, the voice responds with "The all knowing Crystal Ball says." and then gives a random answer. Also, if you ask it to play the [[Magic 8-ball]] the voice will say "Sorry, I don't have one of those. Instead I have a Crystal Ball." and opens the Crystal Ball game. The game also mentions about [[velvet]] [[curtains]] too.&lt;ref name="cball"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ravenscraft |first1=Eric |title=The Best Games and Easter Eggs on Google Assistant |website=How-To Geek |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Davidson''', [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce|F.R.S.A.]], [[Institution of Structural Engineers|MIStructE]] (1884–1956)&lt;ref&gt;''Civil engineering and public works review'', Vol. 51, Lomax, Erskine &amp; Co., 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] structural engineer and early proponent of [[pyramidology]].

==Early life==

David Davidson was born in [[Glasgow]], but later moved to [[England]] where he became a qualified structural engineer, working in the [[City of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire archaeological journal'', Volumes 67-68, Yorkshire Archaeological Society, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; An initial [[Agnostic]] and skeptic of the Bible, in his earlier years Davidson set out to disprove Robert Menzies' and [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]]'s claims that the internal passages of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] form a chronological map of prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;"David Davidson, an avowed agnostic, set out to discredit Robert Menzies' theory" ([[Peter Tompkins]], ''Secrets of the Great Pyramid'', 1971, Harper &amp; Row, p. 108).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Great pyramid, its divine message'' (1941, reprint) contains a preface noting: "In the early part of the present century, Mr. D. Davidson, who had been studying Egyptology as accessory to agnostic criticism of the Scriptures, was introduced to the study of the Great Pyramid by Mr. James Moncrieff of Glasgow, who forwarded him a small elementary book on the subject."&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently spent 25 years analysing the Great Pyramid.

==Conversion to pyramidology==

Despite originally being a skeptic, Davidson later converted to being a proponent of [[pyramidology]] after reconciling [[Flinders Petrie]]'s findings with Smyth's through a complex set of calculations.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Pyramid Its Divine Message'', D. Davidson, H. Aldersmith, Kessinger Publishing, 1992, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The chariots still crash'', Clifford A. Wilson, New American Library, 1976, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flinders Petrie]] claimed he had disproved Smyth's metrological claims regarding the Great Pyramid, but Davidson believed he had found a reconciling truth between both Petrie's and Smyth's calculations and data, later publishing them in his first book ''The Great Pyramid: Its Divine Message'' (1924) as well as an article in a journal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v114/n2873/abs/114750b0.html Pyramid and Prophecy 1924]&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson had worked with Dr. [[Herbert Aldersmith]] between 1910-1918 on his book and through Aldersmith converted to being a [[Christian]] and believer in [[British Israelism]]. Aldersmith's contributions to the book concerned the prophecies he believed were contained in the Great Pyramid (e.g. a chronological metrological map in the passageways and chambers of the pyramid) while Davidson's contributions were purely mathematical. Later in his life Davidson published several works on British Israelism through [[Covenant Publishing]].

In a 1940 edition of his book on pyramidology, Davidson revised Aldersmith's date predictions for [[End Times]] (see [[Herbert Aldersmith]] for these revisions).

On the topic of his conversion to British Israelism he had this to say:&lt;ref&gt;[Thy Kingdom Come, Vol. 27, No. 9 September 2015, pg. 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I studied "critical theology" and God became remote.&lt;br /&gt;
I studied "skeptical theology" to find God less than man.&lt;br /&gt;
I studied a "freak theory" and found it TRUTH&lt;br /&gt;
In the TRUTH of British Israel I found the Bible the living Word of a living God."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principles of '''democratic structuring''' were defined by [[Jo Freeman]] in "[[The Tyranny of Structurelessness]]", first delivered as a talk in 1970, later published in the ''Berkeley Journal of Sociology'' in 1972.  They were influential in power network theories, especially those challenging a single command hierarchy.  She was a major influence in the theory of [[participatory democracy]], [[consensus decision-making]] and [[collective intelligence]], though her own work focused mostly on problems of [[elite]] formation in the American [[women's movement]] of the 1960s.

== Elites ==

"The characteristic prerequisite for participating in all the informal elites of the movement, and thus for exercising power, concern one's background, personality or allocation of time. They do not include one's competence, dedication to feminism, talents or potential contribution to the movement. The former are the criteria one usually uses in determining one's friends. The latter are what any movement or organization has to use if it is going to be politically effective."&lt;ref&gt;Joreen (Jo Freeman), "The Tyranny of Structurelessness," in ''Radical Feminism'', edited by Anne Koedt, Ellen Levine, and Anita Rapone (New York: Quadrangle Books, 1973), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

She defines, by default, '''politics as usual''':  to form power networks one must avoid working with one's friends and work specifically with those who are talented, competent, dedicated, and willing to make contributions - not simply those that one likes or would choose, if one were not actually seeking to re/gain power.

== Domination and effectiveness ==

The [[dialectic]] between formal and informal power is critical:  "If the movement continues deliberately not to select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do exercise power and influence be responsible for it. If the movement continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because it knows it cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does prevent any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously ensures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle ground between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found."&lt;ref&gt;Joreen (Jo Freeman), "The Tyranny of Structurelessness," in ''Radical Feminism'', edited by Anne Koedt, Ellen Levine, and Anita Rapone (New York: Quadrangle Books, 1973),  p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structurelessness ==

Freeman advocated a [[power structure]] and claimed that "once the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of '''structurelessness''', it will be free to develop those forms of organisation best suited to its healthy functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organisation. But neither should we blindly reject them all. Some traditional techniques will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights into what we should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques to use for different situations. The 'lot system' is one such idea which has emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, but it is useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed. But before we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that there is nothing inherently bad about structure itself - only its excessive use."&lt;ref&gt;Joreen (Jo Freeman), "The Tyranny of Structurelessness," in ''Radical Feminism'', edited by Anne Koedt, Ellen Levine, and Anita Rapone (New York: Quadrangle Books, 1973),  pp. 297-298.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politically effective principles ==

Principles of democratic structuring that Freeman claimed were "politically effective also" included:

#  [[Delegation]] of specific authority to specific individuals for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume jobs or tasks by default only means they are not dependably done. If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment which cannot easily be ignored.
# [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]] - requiring all those to whom authority has been delegated to be responsible to all those who selected them. This is how the group has control over people in positions of authority. Individuals may exercise power, but it is the group that has the ultimate say over how the power is exercised.
# [[Decentralization]] - distribution of authority among as many people as is reasonably possible. This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in positions of authority to consult with many others in the process of exercising it. It also gives many people an opportunity to have responsibility for specific tasks and thereby to learn specific skills.
# [[Rotating chair]] - rotating all key tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which are held too long by one person, formally or informally, come to be seen as that person's 'property' and are not relinquished or controlled by the group. If tasks are rotated frequently, the individual does not have time to learn the job well and be glad to do a good job.
# [[Labour specialization]] - allocation of tasks along rational criteria. Selecting someone for a position because they are liked by the group, or giving them hard work because they are disliked, serves neither the group nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest and responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do not have, but this is best done through some sort of 'apprenticeship' programme rather than the 'sink or swim' method. Having a responsibility one can't handle well is demoralising. Being [[Blackballing|blackballed]] from what can be done well does not encourage developing of skills. Women were punished for being competent through most of human history.
# Open [[information flow]] - Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible. Information is power. Access to information enhances one's power. When an [[social network|informal network]] spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion without the group participating. The more one knows about how things work, the more politically effective one can be.
# Equal power relationships imply equal access to resources needed by the group. This is not always perfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member who maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing press or a darkroom owned by a husband) can unduly influence the use of that resource. Skills and information are also resources. Members' skills and information can be equally available only when members are willing to teach what they know to others.&lt;ref&gt;Joreen (Jo Freeman), "The Tyranny of Structurelessness," in ''Radical Feminism'', edited by Anne Koedt, Ellen Levine, and Anita Rapone (New York: Quadrangle Books, 1973),  pp. 298-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman claimed that "when these principles are applied, they ensure that whatever structures are developed by different movement groups will be controlled by and be responsible to the group. The group of people in positions of authority will be organized in structures that are diffuse, flexible, open and temporary. They will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at large. The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise authority within it."&lt;ref&gt;Joreen (Jo Freeman), "The Tyranny of Structurelessness," in ''Radical Feminism'', edited by Anne Koedt, Ellen Levine, and Anita Rapone (New York: Quadrangle Books, 1973),  p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ephesus Archaeological Museum''' ({{lang-tr|Efes Müzesi}}) is an [[Museum#Archaeology museums|archaeological museum]] in [[Selçuk]] near [[İzmir]], Turkey. It houses finds from the nearby [[Ephesus]] excavation site. Its best-known exhibit is the statue of [[Artemis]] retrieved from the [[Temple of Artemis|temple of the goddess]] in Ephesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Ephesus City Ruins in Turkey|url=https://ephesusbreeze.com/ephesus|website=Ephesusbreeze.com|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other museum with a great number of Ephesus artifacts is the [[Ephesos Museum]] in Vienna.

The museum closed at the end of 2012, and reopened in November 2014 after extensive renovations.

The organisation sprang from the wider labour movements of the early 19th century, influenced by [[Chartism]] and campaigns for women's enfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofwomen.org/politicalpre1850.html|title=British Women's Emancipation since the Renaissance|last=|first=|date=|website=History of Women.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fildes, who had been present at the [[Peterloo Massacre]], had previously been president of the Manchester-based [[Society of Female Reformers]] (itself a response to [[Blackburn Female Reform Society]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The Manchester Female Reformers address to the wives, mothers, sisters and daughters of the higher and middling classes of society".

Little is currently known of the workings of many of these societies, but they are evidence of a highly organised and committed group of working class activist women, at a time when culturally such participation was socially discouraged. Katrina Navickas writes about groups like those set up by Fildes that 'Northern working-class women challenged the middle-class notion of separate spheres not simply by entering the political public sphere, but conversely by asserting domestic concerns as public and political.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/944444550|title=Protest and the politics of space and place 1789–1848|last=Navickas,|first=Katrina|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-7190-9705-8|location=Manchester|pages=79|oclc=944444550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gallery grave''' is a form of [[megalithic]] tomb built primarily during the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]]{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} in [[Europe]] in which the main [[Long gallery|gallery]] of the tomb is entered without first passing through an [[antechamber]] or [[hallway]].{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}{{sfn|Daniel|2013|page=9}}{{sfn|Price|2013|page=185}} There are at least four major types of gallery grave (complex, [[transepted gallery grave|transepted]], segmented, and [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge-shaped]]), and they may be covered with an earthen mound (or "[[tumulus]]") or rock mound (or "[[cairn]]").

==About gallery graves==
Archeologist T. Douglas Price argues that the gallery grave was a form of community burial site. Those placed in a gallery grave were most likely members of the same family or hamlet, and probably were intended to reinforce the sense of community.{{sfn|Price|2013|page=185}}

Gallery graves may be straight, or they may form an [[Ell (architecture)|ell]].{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} In some cases, a burial chamber exists at the end of the gallery.{{sfn|Daniel|2013|page=70}} The walls of gallery graves were built of [[Megalithic architectural elements#Orthostat|orthostats]], slab-like stones set upright in the earth.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}}{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=49}} They were roofed with multiple flat stones, although the burial chamber (if one existed) was usually roofed with a single large stone.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}} Multiple burials could occur all at one time, the grave could be reopened several times to accept new burials, or the grave could remain open over an extended period of time to accept multiple burials.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=99}}

[[File:Bézier - Plan de la roche-aux-fées.png|thumb|Drawing of the plan of the segmented gallery grave at La Roche-aux-Fées in France. Capstones (forming the ceiling) are represented by dotted lines.]]
Burials in gallery graves were made in the gallery itself, or in small burial chambers opening off the gallery.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}{{sfn|Roe|1970|page=139}} This is known as a "complex gallery grave".{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} When the adjacent burial chambers are paired, the structure is known as a "[[transepted gallery grave]]".{{sfn|Roe|1970|page=139}}{{sfn|Daniel|2013|page=40}} Gallery graves may also have their galleries subdivided by interior stone slabs.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}{{sfn|Roe|1970|page=139}} These are known as "segmented gallery graves".{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} When two parallel galleries lead to a single terminal burial chamber, this is known as a "parallel gallery grave".{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}}

Some gallery graves were not rectangular in shape, but rather narrowed toward the rear.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} These are known as [[wedge-shaped gallery grave]]s.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} The ceilings of wedge-shaped gallery graves often sloped toward the rear,{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}}{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} and a sill of stone set some distance inside the away from the entrance{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} or one or two slabs set upright in the earth{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} defined a sort of antechamber. The wedge-shaped gallery grave was usually topped by a [[cairn]] (covering of stones) rather than an earthen mound (or "[[tumulus]]"),{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} although an earthen mound was sometimes used.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|pages=46-47}} The cross-sectional shape of the cairn could be round, oval, or D-shaped, and often a [[Megalithic architectural elements#Kerb or peristalith|kerb]] (ring of stone) was used to help [[Revetment|revet]] the cairn and keep it in place.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}}{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=47}} Some wedge-shaped gallery graves had curved rear walls, while others were linear.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} A few had the terminal burial chamber at the rear of the gallery, although this was usually blocked off.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} Wedge-shaped gallery graves sometimes had a set of outer walls. These could be parallel to the inner walls, or they could be set at an even stronger angle (emphasizing the wedge-like nature of the tomb).{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} Wedge-shaped gallery graves usually faced west, and often had a pair of upright stone slabs linking the inner and outer walls at the entrance.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}}

The tumulus (or "barrow") covering a gallery grave may be [[oval barrow|ovate]] or [[long barrow|long]].{{sfn|Chadwick|Fox|Dickins|2013|page=9}} The sides of the tumulus may be parallel or not.{{sfn|Chadwick|Fox|Dickins|2013|pages=5, 9}} The tumulus was designed so that the end of the gallery (or the terminal burial chamber, if one existed) was at the center of the tumulus.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}} A tumulus may contain several gallery graves radiating outward from the center.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}} Since the earth atop the gallery grave was only loosely piled up, it often washed away due to erosion. Many gallery graves today lie exposed to the air, when originally they would have lain deep within a tumulus.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|pages=101-102}}

===Transepted===
'''Transepted gallery graves''' have burial monuments with side rooms extending laterally from a central chamber. They are found at sites in the [[Loire]] valley of France, south west [[Great Britain]] and in [[Ireland]] and it is thought the builders had cultural links with one another.

===Wedge-shaped===
[[File:Altair Burial Tomb, Schull, Co. Cork.jpg|thumb|[[Altar Wedge Tomb]], County Cork]]
[[File:Glantane East Wedge Tomb.jpg|thumb|[[Glantane East]] Wedge Tomb, County Cork, Ireland]]
A '''wedge-shaped [[gallery grave]]''' or '''wedge tomb''' is a type of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[chamber tomb]]. They are so named because the burial chamber narrows at one end (usually decreasing both in height and width from west to east), producing a wedge shape in elevation. An [[antechamber]] is separated from the burial area by a simple [[jamb]] or sill, and the doorway generally faces west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= BBC History | year= 2004 | title= Irish Neolithic Tombs'' | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3181673| accessdate=2006-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinguishing characteristic of wedge tombs is the double-walling of the gallery. They were often covered by [[cairn]]s, which could be round, oval or D-shaped, often with a [[Megalithic architectural elements|kerb]] to revet it. More are low sized, usually about 1.5 metres high, and are generally found on mountainsides, about three-quarters the way up.

Wedge tombs were built between the Irish late  [[Neolithic]] and middle [[Bronze Age]]s (about 2500 to 2000BC). Today, between 500 and 550 known wedge tombs survive in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= iol.ie | year= | title= ''A Brief Guide To Irish Archaeological Sites'' | url=http://www.iol.ie/~sec/sites.htm#Wedge%20Tombs| accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are found predominantly in the west and north west of the island.


===Dating===
Along with the [[dolmen]] and [[passage grave]], the gallery grave is the most common megalithic tomb in western Europe.{{sfn|Price|2013|page=184}}{{sfn|Piggott|1965|page=61}}

Gallery graves were usually constructed during the Neolithic Age, which began about 10,200 BC and ended in Europe about 3,200 BC.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} Some, however, were constructed in the Middle and Late [[Bronze Age]], about 2,300 BC to 600 BC.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} Dating of some gallery graves is difficult, as the tombs may have been constructed in the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, but reopened and used for burials until the Late Bronze Age.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=47}}

===Gallery vs. passage grave===
The difference between a complex gallery grave and a [[passage grave]] (which also has smaller burial chambers opening off the main passage) is two-fold.  First, the gallery grave gallery will be as high and wide as the side burial chambers, while in a passage grave the passage is not as high or wide as the burial chambers.  Second, gallery graves are usually topped by a V-shaped tumulus, while passage graves are almost always covered by a round tumulus.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}

==Recognized gallery graves==
[[File:17. Labbacallee Wedge Tomb, Co. Cork.jpg|thumb|Interior of Labbacallee, a wedge-shaped gallery grave in Ireland.]]
Archeologists Ian Shaw and Robert Jameson argued in 1999 that the best-researched gallery graves are the [[Severn-Cotswold tomb]]s in [[Wales]] and [[South West England]] in the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} Other important gallery graves include:

* [[Court cairn]], found in western and northern [[Ireland]] and southwest [[Scotland]]
* [[Giants' grave]] in [[Sardinia]]
* [[Glantane East]] wedge-shaped tomb in Ireland
* [[Naveta]] grave in [[Menorca]]
* [[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]] ''allées couverte'' in northern [[France]] and southern [[Belgium]]
* Severn-Cotswold tombs in Wales and South West England in the United Kingdom{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}

Inserting a foreign device into the [[uterus]] causes an [[inflammatory response]], which creates a hostile environment for [[sperm]].&lt;!--

In 1934, Japanese physician Tenrei Ota developed a variation of the Gräfenberg ring that contained a supportive structure in the center. The addition of this central disc lowered the IUD's expulsion rate. However, insertion of these devices caused high rates of infection and were condemned by the medical community.&lt;!--

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5224">'''Hal K. Rothman''' (1958–2007) was a historian,  professor, radio show host, editor, public intellectual, and prolific author.  Noted environmental history scholar Char Miller called him "a dynamic teacher, riveting speaker, compelling scholar, and sharp-tongued pundit."&lt;ref&gt;Char Miller, "Remembering the Life Force of Hal Rothman," Newwest available via: http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/remembering_the_life_force_of_hal_rothman&lt;/ref&gt;  The writer Will Sarvis called Rothman "one of the best editors" he had ever worked with.&lt;ref&gt;Will Sarvis, "Remembering Hal K.

The Mission comprised three strands; [[social anthropology]], [[physical anthropology]] and [[archaeology]]. The results of the study were published in a series of academics papers and monographs between in 1936 and 1955.  The Mission had a major influence on the development of academic knowledge in and about Ireland and many of the publications continue to be cited by modern scholars across a wide range of disciplines&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;Anne Byrne, Ricca Edmondson and Tony Varley, 'Introduction to the Third Edition', pages ''i-ci'' in ''Family and Community in Ireland'' by Conrad M.

The Irish research project was part of a larger comparative project using ethnographic methods of investigation. 

== The Name ==
The name of the study is referred to by a number of labels in academic and popular media, including "Harvard Irish Survey" and "Harvard Irish Mission". The archaeological section, in particular, was and still is frequently referred to as the "Harvard Archaeological Expedition to Ireland".  However, the official name of the study was the "Harvard Irish Mission".&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16105">[[Image:Isaac Jacob Schmidt.jpg|thumb|right|Isaac Jacob Schmidt]]
'''Isaac Jacob Schmidt''' (October 4, 1779 – August 27, 1847) was an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] specializing in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. Schmidt was a [[Moravian church|Moravian]] missionary to the [[Kalmyks]] and devoted much of his labours to Bible translation.

Born in [[Amsterdam]], he spent much of his career in [[St. Petersburg]] as a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. He published the first grammar and dictionary of Mongolian, as well as a grammar and dictionary of Tibetan. He also translated Sanang Sechen's [[Erdeniin Tobchi|Erdeni-yin tobči]] into German, and several [[Geser Khan]] epics into Russian and German. His works are regarded as ground-breaking for the establishment of Mongolian and Tibetan studies.

==Early life==

Schmidt was born into an Amsterdam [[Moravian church|Moravian]] family. At the age of six, he was sent to school of the Moravian community in [[Neuwied]]. Due to the advance of [[Napoleon]]'s troops, he returned home in 1791. His family lost all their wealth in an economic crisis following Napoleon's occupation of the Netherlands, but this gave Isaak Jakob Schmidt the impetus to begin a trading apprenticeship and learn several languages. In 1798 he accepted an offer by his church to work at their [[Sarepta]] post on the [[Volga River]], emigrated to Russia and adopted Russian citizenship.

==Research work==

His work gave Schmidt an opportunity for frequent business contacts with the local Kalmyks, and he eventually learnt both the [[Clear script|Kalmyk]] and the [[Mongolian script|classical Mongolian script]]. At the same time, he began collecting Kalmyk and Mongolian manuscripts and keeping records on Kalmyk language, religion and history. From 1807 to 1812 Schmidt worked for his church in [[Saratov]]. In 1812, he married his wife Helena Wigand. In the same year, his church sent him to [[Moscow]] and then to [[St. Petersburg]]. Unfortunately, many of his records and collected manuscripts were destroyed in the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire of Moscow]] of that year.

In 1812, [[Julius Klaproth]]'s ''Dissertation on language and script of the Uighurs'' (''Abhandlung über die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren'') became the subject of a long-standing dispute. Klaproth asserted that Uighur was a Turkic language, while Schmidt was persuaded that Uighur should be classified as a "Tangut" language.&lt;ref&gt;Walravens, [http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/japonica-hu/10/walravens-hartmut-178/PDF/walravens.pdf  p. 181.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, Schmidt concentrated on translations of the Bible into Kalmyk and Mongolian. His scientific work became noted after the publication of a work on the history of Mongols and Tibetans in 1824. His daughter Emilie was born in 1828. Until his death in 1847, Schmidt published a multitude of works on Mongolian and Tibetan studies, and became a member of a number of different European academic societies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9849">The following is a [[bibliography]] of works by [[Jacques Derrida]].

The precise chronology of Derrida's work is difficult to establish, as many of his books are not monographs but collections of essays that had been printed previously. Virtually all of his works were delivered in slightly different form as lectures and revised for publication. Some of his work was first collected in English, and additional content has been added to some collection with the appearance of English translations or later French editions.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; the English edition collects an alternate translation of the essay "Signature, Event, Context", which already appeared in ''Margins of Philosophy,'' with "Limited Inc., abc" and "Afterword: Toward an Ethics of Discussion," which had not been previously collected in any language. The latter essays were collected first in English, partially because the last of the two was written in response to a questions put in a letter from [[Gerald Graff]].

&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt; the English edition collects previous and original translations, some of which are excerpts of larger works; the French subsequent edition is expanded, containing additional essays which appeared in the interim.

{{Liberalism sidebar}}

'''Liberalism in the United States''' is a broad political philosophy centered on what many see as the [[unalienable rights]] of the individual. The fundamental [[liberalism|liberal]] ideals of [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of religion]] for all belief systems, and the [[separation of church and state]], right to [[due process]], and [[equality under the law]] are widely accepted as a common foundation across the spectrum of liberal thought.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Modern liberalism in the United States]] includes issues such as [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], [[Reproductive rights|reproductive]] and other [[women's rights]], [[voting rights]] for all adult citizens, [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], [[environmental justice]], and government protection of [[Right to an adequate standard of living|freedom from want]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeffries, John W.|title=The "New" New Deal: FDR and American Liberalism, 1937–1945|journal=Political Science Quarterly|volume=105|number=3|date=1990|pages=397–418|jstor=2150824}}&lt;/ref&gt; National   [[social services]] such as: equal education opportunities; access to health care; and transportation infrastructure are intended to meet the responsibility to [[General Welfare clause|"promote the general welfare"]] of all citizens. Some American liberals, who call themselves [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]], [[fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]], or [[Libertarianism|libertarians]], support fundamental liberal ideals but disagree with [[Social liberalism|modern liberal]] thought, holding that [[economic freedom]] is more important than [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and that [[Welfare state|providing for the general welfare]] exceeds the legitimate role of government.&lt;ref&gt;Pena, David S. ''Economic Barbarism and Managerialism,'' 2001, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1930s, without a qualifier the term "liberalism" in the United States usually refers to "modern liberalism", a political philosophy exemplified by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and, later, [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]].  It is a form of [[social liberalism]], whose accomplishments include the [[Works Progress Administration]] and the [[Social Security Act]] in 1935, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

According to [[Louis Hartz]], liberalism in the United States differs from [[Liberalism worldwide|liberalism elsewhere in the world]] because America never had a resident hereditary [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]],&lt;ref&gt;Louis Hartz, ''The Liberal Tradition in America'', (1991) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and so avoided much of the "[[Class conflict|class warfare]]" that swept Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''"Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans", [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], in ''The Politics of Hope'', (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

From left to right, top to bottom: Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Paul Krugman, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor.]]
The origins of American liberalism lie in [[Age of Enlightenment|the political ideals of the Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bryan-Paul Frost|author2=Jeffrey Sikkenga|title=History of American Political Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w81L1qAhNjoC&amp;pg=PA33|year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books|page=33|isbn=9780739106242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Constitution of the United States]] of 1787 set up the first modern [[republic]], with sovereignty in the people (not in a monarch) and no hereditary ruling aristocracy.  However, the Constitution limited liberty, in particular by accepting slavery. The [[Founding Fathers]] recognized the contradiction, and most expected slavery to wither away. Indeed, it was abolished in all the Northern states by 1804, but due to the demand for raw cotton by the [[Industrial Revolution]],{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} plantation slavery continued to flourish in the [[Deep South]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

From the time of the [[American Revolution]] to the present day, America has extended liberty to ever broader classes of people.  The states abolished many restrictions on voting for white males in the early 19th century. The Constitution was amended in 1865 to abolish slavery, in 1870 to extend the vote to Black men, in 1920 to extend the vote to women, and in 1971 to lower the voting age to 18.  The [[Jim Crow]] system of the South between the 1890s and 1960s relegated blacks to second class citizenship, until it was overthrown by the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and new federal laws in 1964 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Fernbach and Charles Julian Bishko, ''Charting democracy in America'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, political figures such as [[Franklin Roosevelt]] adopted the term "liberal" to describe an individual in favor of some government activism but opposed to more radical reforms.&lt;ref name=Reichley209210/&gt;

After 1933, modern liberals used the [[New Deal]] to provide jobs during the [[Great Depression]].  The [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act of 1935]] provided retirement and disability income for Americans unable to work or unable to find jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney M. Milkis and Jerome M. Mileur, ''The New Deal and the triumph of liberalism'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Social Security Act of 1965]], this was extended to provide benefits for Americans unable to work due to illness.

According to [[Louis Hartz]], liberalism was the only significant political tradition in the United States.  However, in the 1970s, [[Bernard Bailyn]], [[Gordon S. Wood|Gordon Wood]] and [[J. G. A. Pocock]] saw [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] as the main political tradition.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}  In the 1980s, J.

===Early liberalism===
{{Main|American Enlightenment}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
The United States of America was the first country to be founded on the liberal ideas of [[John Locke]] and other philosophers of the Enlightenment, with no monarchy, no hereditary aristocracy, and no established religion.  The American [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] guarantees every citizen the freedoms advocated by the liberal philosophers: equality under the law, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to gather in peaceful assembly, the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, and the right to bear arms, among other freedoms and rights.  In this sense, virtually all Americans are liberals.  However, questions arose, both before and after the country was founded.  In the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1856–57, the Supreme Court ruled that these rights only applied to White men, and that Blacks had no rights whatsoever that any White man was obliged to respect.  Therefore, the constitution was amended several times to extend these rights to ever larger classes of citizens, to all citizens in 1868, then specifically to Blacks in 1870, to women in 1919, and to people unable to afford a poll tax in 1964.

===Classical liberalism===
{{Main|Classical liberalism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Classical liberalism in the United States (also called ''laissez-faire liberalism''&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Adams, Ian, ''Political Ideology Today'' (2002), Manchester University Press, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;) is the belief that a free market economy is the most productive.  It may be represented by [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s statement "that government is best which governs least."  Classical liberalism is a philosophy of individualism and self-responsibility.  Classical liberals in the United States believe that if the economy is left to the natural forces of supply and demand, free of government intervention, the result is the most abundant satisfaction of human wants.  Modern classical liberals oppose the concepts of [[social democracy]] and the [[welfare state]].

===Modern liberalism===
{{Main|Modern liberalism in the United States|Progressivism}}

In 1883 [[Lester Frank Ward]] (1841–1913) published ''Dynamic Sociology: Or Applied Social Science, as Based Upon Statical Sociology and the Less Complex Sciences'' and laid out the basic tenets of modern American liberalism while at the same time attacking the laissez-faire policies advocated by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William Graham Sumner]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Steele Commager, ed., ''Lester Ward and the Welfare State'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Ward was a passionate advocate for a sociology which would intelligently and scientifically direct the development of society.&lt;ref&gt;on Ward and Sumner see Charlotte G. O'Kelley,  and John W. Petras, "Images of Man in Early American Sociology. Part 2: The Changing Concept of Social Reform," ''Journal of the History of ohe Behavioral Sciences'' 1970 6(4): 317–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential thinker in the [[Progressive Era]] was [[Herbert Croly]] (1869–1930). He effectively combined classical liberal theory with progressive philosophy and founded the periodical ''[[The New Republic]]'' to present his ideas. Croly presented the case for a [[mixed economy]], increased spending on education, and the creation of a society based on the "brotherhood of mankind." In 1909, Croly published ''[[The Promise of American Life]]'', in which he proposed raising the general standard of living by means of economic planning, though he opposed aggressive unionization.&lt;ref&gt;Byron Dexter, "Herbert Croly and the Promise of American Life," ''Political Science Quarterly,'' Vol. 70, No. 2 (June 1955), pp. 197–218 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2145222 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The Techniques of Democracy]]'' (1915) he argued against both dogmatic individualism and dogmatic socialism.  As editor of the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'', Croly had the forum to reach the intellectual community.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Levy, ''Herbert Croly of the New Republic: The Life and Thought of an American Progressive'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Liberalism wagers that a state ... can be strong but constrained—strong because constrained. ... Rights to education and other requirements for human development and security aim to advance the opportunity and personal dignity of minorities and to promote a creative and productive society. To guarantee those rights, liberals have supported a wider social and economic role for the state, counterbalanced by more robust guarantees of civil liberties and a wider social system of checks and balances anchored in an independent press and pluralistic society.|Paul Starr, sociologist at Princeton University, The New Republic, March 2007}}

==Evolution==
{{Main|Modern liberalism in the United States}}

===The New Deal===
President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1882–1945), came to office in 1933 amid the economic calamity of the [[Great Depression]], offering the nation a [[New Deal]] intended to alleviate economic want and unemployment, provide greater opportunities, and restore prosperity.  His presidency from 1933 to 1945, the longest in U.S. history, was marked by an increased role for the Federal government in addressing the nation's economic and other problems. [[Work relief program]]s provided jobs, ambitious projects such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] were created to promote economic development, and a [[Social security]] system was established. The Great Depression dragged on through the 1930s, however, despite the New Deal programs, which met with mixed success in solving the nation's economic problems. Economic progress for minorities was hindered by discrimination, about which the Roosevelt administration did less than subsequent administrations, but more than had been done before. The New Deal provided direct relief for minorities in the 1930s (through the [[Works Progress Administration]], [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and other agencies); and, during World War II, executive orders and the [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]] opened millions of new jobs to minorities and forbade discrimination in companies with government contracts. The 1.5 million black veterans in 1945 were fully entitled to generous veteran benefits from the [[GI Bill]] on the same basis as everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Black, ''Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Deal consisted of three types of programs designed to produce "Relief, Recovery and Reform":&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Sitkoff, ed. ''Fifty Years Later: The New Deal Evaluated'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief was the immediate effort to help the one-third of the population that was hardest hit by the depression. Roosevelt expanded Hoover's FERA work relief program, and added the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), and starting in 1935 the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). In 1935 the [[Social Security Act]] (SSA) and [[unemployment benefit#United States|unemployment insurance]] programs were added. Separate programs were set up for relief in rural areas, such as the [[Resettlement Administration]] and [[Farm Security Administration]].

Recovery was the goal of restoring the economy to pre-depression levels. It involved "pump priming" (deficit spending), dropping the [[gold standard]], efforts to re-inflate farm prices that were too low, and efforts to increase [[foreign trade]].  New Deal efforts to help corporate America were chiefly channeled through a Hoover program, the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).

Reform was based on the assumption that the depression was caused by the inherent instability of the market and that government intervention was necessary to rationalize and stabilize the economy, and to balance the interests of farmers, business and labor. Reform measures included the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA), regulation of Wall Street by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934|Securities Exchange Act]] (SEA), the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA) for farm programs, [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) insurance for bank deposits enacted through the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] of 1933, and the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA) (also known as the Wagner Act) dealing with labor-management relations. Despite urgings by some New Dealers, there was no major anti-trust program. Roosevelt opposed [[socialism]] (in the sense of state ownership of the means of production), and only one major program, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), involved government ownership of the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882–1940'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

In international affairs, Roosevelt's presidency was dominated by isolationism until 1938, followed by an increasingly central role in [[World War II]], especially after America's formal entry into the war in 1941. Anticipating the post-war period, Roosevelt strongly supported proposals to create a [[United Nations]] organization as a means of encouraging mutual cooperation to solve problems on the international stage. His commitment to internationalist ideals was in the tradition of [[Woodrow Wilson]], architect of the failed [[League of Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raabcollection.com/detail.aspx?cat=2&amp;subcat=38&amp;man=261 |title=Franklin Roosevelt Autographs - Presidential |publisher=Raab Collection |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180619/http://www.raabcollection.com/detail.aspx?cat=2&amp;subcat=38&amp;man=261 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to his support for the establishment of the [[United Nations]], with the proviso that the U.S. would have a veto power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alonzo Hamby]], ''For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom 1940–1945'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism during the Cold War===
U.S. liberalism of the [[Cold War]] era was the immediate heir to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and the slightly more distant heir to the [[Progressive Era|Progressives]] of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Liberalism and Its Challengers: From F.D.R. to Bush'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol Stern]] wrote, "Cold War liberalism deserves credit for the greatest American achievement since [[World War II]]—winning the Cold War."&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Sol (Winter, 2010) [http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_1_ramparts.html "The Ramparts I Watched."] ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential tenets of Cold War liberalism can be found in Roosevelt's [[Four Freedoms]] (1941): of these, [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion|of religion]] were classic liberal freedoms, as was "freedom from fear" (freedom from tyrannical government), but "freedom from want" was another matter. Roosevelt proposed a notion of freedom that went beyond government non-interference in private lives. "Freedom from want" could justify positive government action to meet economic needs, a concept more associated with the concepts of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's]] Republican party, [[Henry Clay|Clay's]] Whig Party, and [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton's]] economic principles of government intervention and subsidy than the more radical [[socialism]] and [[social democracy]] of European thinkers, or with prior versions of classical liberalism as represented by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s Democratic-Republican and [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson's]] Democratic party.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In the 1950s and 1960s, both major U.S. political parties included liberal and conservative factions. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] had two wings: on the one hand, Northern and Western liberals, on the other generally conservative Southern [[whites]]. Difficult to classify were the northern [[urban area|urban]] Democratic "[[political machine]]s". The urban machines had supported New Deal economic policies, but would slowly come apart over racial issues. Some historians have divided the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] into liberal [[Wall Street]] and conservative [[Main street|Main Street]] factions; others have noted that the GOP's conservatives came from landlocked states (Robert Taft of Ohio and Barry Goldwater of Arizona) and the liberals tended to come from California (Earl Warren and Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey), New York ([[Nelson Rockefeller]]), and other coastal states.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Opposing both [[communism]] and conservatism, Cold War liberalism resembled earlier "liberalisms" in its views on many social issues and personal liberty, but its economic views were not those of [[free market|free-market]] Jeffersonian liberalism nor those of European social democrats.  They never endorsed state socialism, but did call for spending on education, science, and infrastructure, notably the expansion of [[NASA]] and the construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]].  Their progressive ideas continued the legacy of Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Most prominent and constant among the positions of Cold War liberalism were:
* Support for a domestic economy built on a balance of power between labor (in the form of organized [[trade union|unions]]) and management (with a tendency to be more interested in large corporations than in [[small business]]).
* A foreign policy focused on containing the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies, one factor leading to its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] at the end of 1991.
* The continuation and expansion of New Deal social welfare programs (in the broad sense of welfare, including programs such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]).
* An embrace of [[Keynesian economics]]. By way of compromise with political groupings to their right, this often became, in practice [[military Keynesianism]].

At first liberals generally did not see FDR's successor [[Harry S. Truman]] as one of their own, viewing him as a Democratic Party hack. However, liberal politicians and liberal organizations such as the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) sided with Truman in opposing communism both at home and abroad, sometimes at the sacrifice of [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubert Humphrey]], for example, in 1950 put before the Senate a bill to establish detention centers where those declared subversive by the [[President of the United States|President]] could be held without trial.  It did not pass.

Liberals were united in their opposition to [[McCarthyism]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Fried, ''Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The liberal consensus===
By 1950, the liberal ideology was so intellectually dominant that the literary critic [[Lionel Trilling]] could write that "liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition ... there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in circulation."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bloom, ''Prodigal sons: the New York intellectuals &amp; their world'' (1986) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost two decades, Cold War liberalism remained the dominant paradigm in U.S. politics, peaking with the landslide victory of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] over [[Barry Goldwater]] in the 1964 presidential election. Lyndon Johnson had been a New Deal Democrat in the 1930s and by the 1950s had decided that the Democratic Party had to break from its segregationist past and endorse racial liberalism as well as economic liberalism.

===Liberals and civil rights===
Cold War liberalism emerged at a time when most [[African American]]s were politically and economically disenfranchised.  Beginning with ''To Secure These Rights'', an official report issued by the Truman White House in 1947, self-proclaimed liberals increasingly embraced the civil rights movement.  In 1948, President Truman desegregated the armed forces and the Democrats inserted a strong civil rights plank in the party platform, even though delegates from the Deep South walked out and nominated a third party ticket, the [[Dixiecrat]]s, headed by [[Strom Thurmond]].  Truman abolished discrimination in the Armed Forces, leading to the integration of military units in the early 1950s.  However, no civil rights legislation was passed until a weak bill in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbzFbBH65EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=liberalism Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945–1974]'' (1996) pp. 148–64, 413&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, relations between white liberals and the civil rights movement became increasingly strained; civil rights leaders accused liberal politicians of temporizing and procrastinating, although they realized they needed the support of Northern whites{{clarify|date=March 2014}} to pass any legislation over Southern obstructionism. Many white liberals believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would only anger many Southern whites and make it even more difficult to pass civil rights laws through Congress.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In response to that concern, civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] agreed to tone down the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Kennedy finally endorsed the March on Washington and proposed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], but he could not get it passed during his lifetime. [[Lyndon Johnson]], who took office in November 1963, used the image of Kennedy's martyrdom to mobilize northern support, along with the black leadership community, to pass major civil rights legislation: the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. The result was an end to legalized segregation and an end to restrictions on black voting.  However, it was followed a wave of black riots in the inner cities, which made for "long hot summers"{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} in every major city from 1964 through 1970.  The riots alienated much of the white working class that had been the base of the labor union element in the civil rights coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945–1974'' pp. 542–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil rights movement itself was becoming fractured. On March 8, 1964, [[Malcolm X]] stated he was going to organize a [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] organization that would try to "heighten the political consciousness" of African Americans.&lt;ref name=Times64-03-09&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/09/archives/malcolm-x-splits-with-muhammad-suspended-muslim-leader-plans-black.html |title=Malcolm X Splits with Muhammad |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |last=Handler |first=M. S. |date=March 9, 1964 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1966, a [[Black Power]] movement had emerged; Black Power advocates accused white liberals of trying to control the civil rights agenda.  Proponents of Black Power wanted African-Americans to follow an "ethnic model" for obtaining power, not unlike that of Democratic [[political machine]]s in large cities.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  This put them on a collision course with urban machine politicians.  And, on its edges, the Black Power movement contained racial separatists who wanted to give up on integration altogether—a program that could not be endorsed by American liberals of any race.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  The mere existence of such individuals (who always got more media attention than their actual numbers might have warranted) contributed to "white backlash" against liberals and civil rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbzFbBH65EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=liberalism Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945–1974]'' pp. 550–55, 652–68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberals and Vietnam===
While the civil rights movement isolated liberals from the working class and [[southern Democrats]], the [[Vietnam War]] threw another wedge into the liberal ranks, dividing pro-war "hawks" such as Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] from "doves" such as Senator (and 1972 presidential candidate) [[George McGovern]]. As the war became the leading political issue of the day, agreement on domestic matters was not enough to hold the liberal consensus together.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Vietnam was part of the strategy of [[containment]] of Soviet Communism which began in earnest after World War II with the descent of the so-called [[Iron Curtain]]. In the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy was more "hawkish" on [[Southeast Asia]] than Richard Nixon. Although it can be argued that the war expanded only under Johnson, there was much continuity of their [[United States Cabinet|cabinets]]{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.

As opposition to the war grew, a large portion of that opposition came from within liberal ranks.  After Johnson refused to run again, assassination removed [[Robert Kennedy]] from contention and noted liberal [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Hubert Humphrey emerged from the disastrous [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] with the presidential nomination of a deeply divided party. Much of the party's [[right-wing politics|right wing]] had left to support [[Governor of Alabama]] [[George Wallace]]. The result was a narrow victory for Republican Richard Nixon, a man who, although a [[California]] native, was largely regarded as from the old Northeast [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] establishment.  Nixon enacted many liberal policies, including the establishment of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], normalizing relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], and starting the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] to reduce the availability of [[ballistic missile]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Nixon and the liberal consensus===
[[File:Liberal Gallup 8-10.svg|250px|thumb|right|Percent of self-identified liberals in the United States, broken down by state, according to Gallup, August 2010. Darker colors mean more liberals per state (click image for details).]]

Liberals criticized Nixon for reasons going back to his attacks on [[Alger Hiss]], whom Nixon accused of being a spy for the Soviets. Criticism on Nixon continued the [[Vietnam War]]. And yet, as president, Nixon had many policy positions that can only be described as liberal. Before Nixon was elected, the liberal wing of his own party favored politicians such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[William Scranton]], while in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 election]] Nixon appealed to a "[[silent majority]]" of conservatives, disgusted and frightened by soaring crime rates and widespread race riots.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Flamm, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2sUzCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Law and Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s]'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nixon's Enemies List]] was composed largely of liberals.  And yet, as president Nixon pursued many liberal policies, often through executive orders.  Examples include the creation of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], which he achieved without a vote in Congress, and the increase in funding for such liberal programs as the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]],  "The Culture Wars, 1965–1995: A Historian's Map".

The 1965–1974 period was a major liberal activist era in Congress, with the Democratic-led Congresses during the presidency of Richard Nixon continuing to produce liberal domestic policies. They organized themselves internally to round up votes, track legislation, mobilize interests, and produce bills without direct assistance from the [[White House]]. A wide range of progressive measures were carried out, such as in Social Security (with a 20% benefit increase and linkage to automatic cost-of-living increases in 1972), public welfare (with expansion of unemployment compensation, [[Food Stamp Program|food stamps]], and supplemental security income additions to social security), workplace rules (with the passage of the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in 1970), urban aid (with the addition of mass transit subsidies to highway construction enactments), environmentalism (with the passage of the [[National Environmental Protection Act]] of 1969 and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1970), aid to education (including [[Title IX]] in 1972), civil rights (with the extension of the [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/renka/ui320-75/presidents/nixon/nixon_imperialpres.asp |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes | title=Richard Nixon and the Imperial Presidency|first=Russell D.|last=Renka|website=Southeast Missouri State University |publisher= UI320 – The Modern Presidency|date=March 26, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213025040/http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/renka/ui320-75/presidents/nixon/nixon_imperialpres.asp |archivedate=February 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and nutrition (with the establishment of the [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]] in 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r0vaciZ9nJ0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=hubert+humphrey+WIC+1972&amp;q=hubert%20humphrey%20WIC%201972|title=The Third Freedom|website=google.co.uk|isbn=9780742521254|last1=McGovern|first1=George|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political dominance of the liberal consensus, even into the Nixon years, can best be seen in policies such as the establishment of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] or in Nixon's (failed) proposal to replace the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income by way of a [[negative income tax]]. [[Affirmative action]] in its most quota-oriented form was a Nixon administration policy. Even the Nixon "[[War on Drugs]]" allocated two-thirds of its funds for treatment, a far higher ratio than was to be the case under any subsequent President, Republican or Democrat.  Additionally, Nixon's normalization of diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] and his policy of ''[[détente]]'' with the Soviet Union were probably more popular with liberals than with his conservative base.  Nixon also successfully supported a [[cost of living adjustment]] for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] recipients.

An opposing view, offered by [[Cass R. Sunstein]], in ''The Second Bill of Rights'' (Basic Books, 2004, {{ISBN|0-465-08332-3}}) argues that Nixon, through his [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] appointments, effectively ended a decades-long expansion under U.S. law of economic rights along the lines of those put forward in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

===American liberalism, 1970 to the present day===
During the Nixon years (and through the 1970s), the liberal consensus began to come apart. The alliance with [[Dixicrats|white Southern Democrats]] had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough to make up for the loss of some Southern Democrats. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the U.S. and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it. Within the Democratic party leadership, there was a turn toward moderation on racial themes after the defeat of liberal [[George McGovern]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanes Walton|title=Reelection: William Jefferson Clinton as a Native-son Presidential Candidate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wc_ee95tHkoC&amp;pg=PA38|year=2000|publisher=Columbia UP|pages=38–39|isbn=9780231115520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in the Republican ranks, a new wing of the party emerged. The anti-establishment conservatives who had been aroused by [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964 challenged the more liberal leadership in 1976 and took control of the party under [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980.  Liberal Republicans faded away, even in their Northeastern strongholds.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol C. Rae, ''The decline and fall of the liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the present'' (Oxford University Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;   More centrist groups such as the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) supported [[Bill Clinton]] and challenged liberals for control of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Borrelli, "Finding the third way: Bill Clinton, the DLC, and the Democratic platform of 1992." ''[[Journal of Policy History]]'' 13#4 (2001) pp. 429–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Clinton portrayed himself as a centrist "[[New Democrat]]"; he distanced himself from "New Deal" Democrats. With help from the southern-dominated [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) he claimed the center of national politics.&lt;ref&gt;Iwan Morgan,  "Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and the new democratic economics." ''[[The Historical Journal]]'' 47#4 (2004): 1015–39. [http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1379473/1/S0018246X0400408Xa.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] succeeded in raising taxes on the rich, while keeping them steady on the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Baker, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/obama-inauguration-draws-hundreds-of-thousands.html "Obama Offers Liberal Vision: 'We Must Act,'"] ''New York Times'' Jan. 21, 2013, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21, 2013, Obama delivered his (second) inaugural address that championed numerous liberal causes.

==Demographics==
While it is difficult to gather demographic information on ideological groups, recent surveys by the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and [[CBS News]] indicate that between 18% and 27% of American adults identify as liberal, versus [[moderate]] or [[conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://documents.nytimes.com/new-york-times-cbs-news-poll-the-war-in-afghanistan#p=12 |title=New York Times/CBS News Poll: The War in Afghanistan |publisher=New York Times|date=2009-12-10|accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], exit polls showed that 22% of the electorate self-identified as "liberal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1 |title=Exit Polls Conducted by Edison Research Media|publisher=CNN |date=2008-11-04|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2004 study by the [[Pew Research Center]], liberals were tied with the conservative sub-group, the "Enterprisers", for the most affluent group, and were the ideological demographic with the highest rate of college education. Of those who identified as liberal, 49% were college graduates and 41% had household incomes exceeding $75,000, compared to 27% and 28% as the national average, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/242.pdf|publisher=Pew Research Center| date= May 10, 2005 |title=Beyond Red vs. Blue|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[liberal bias in academia|Liberalism also remains the dominant political ideology in academia]], with 72% of full-time faculty identifying as liberal in a 2004 study relying on 1999 data from the North American Academic Study Survey.&lt;ref name="Kurtz, H. (29 March 2005). College Faculties A Most Liberal Lot, Study Finds. ''The Washington Post''."&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8427-2005Mar28.html|author=Kurtz, H. |title=College Faculties A Most Liberal Lot, Study Finds|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=May 18, 2016 | date= March 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] were most liberal, whereas business and engineering departments were the least liberal, though even in the business departments, liberals outnumbered conservatives 49% to 39%.

Exit polls show nearly 90% of liberals voted for Democrats in House elections since 2006. They voted 88% for Democrats in 2014; 88% in 2012; 93% in 2010; 89% in 2008; and 89% in 2006. Before that they were in the low 80s: 80% in 2004; 81% in 2002; 84% in 2000; 84% in 1998; 82% in 1996; 81% in 1994; and 81% in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/04/us/politics/2014-exit-polls.html|date=November 4, 2014|title=Exit Polls 1992-2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Montezuma Castle National Monument''' protects a set of well-preserved dwellings located in [[Camp Verde, Arizona]] which were built and used by the [[Sinagua]] people, a [[pre-Columbian]] culture closely related to the [[Hohokam]] and other [[Prehistoric Southwestern cultural divisions|indigenous peoples of the southwestern United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montezuma Castle National Monument|url=http://www.nps.gov/moca/index.htm|accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; between approximately 1100 and 1425 AD. The main structure comprises five stories and twenty rooms, and was built over the course of three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arizonaguide.com/things-to-do/montezuma-castle-national-monument-camp-verde-az ArizonaGuide]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither part of the monument's name is correct. When European-Americans first observed the ruins in the 1860s, by then long-abandoned, they named them for the famous [[Aztec]] emperor [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] in the mistaken belief that he had been connected to their construction (see also [[Montezuma (mythology)|Montezuma mythology]]).&lt;ref name=JP02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/moca/protas/chap1.htm|title=Explorations, Impressions, and Excavations: The Prehistoric Ruins of the Verde Valley in the Nineteenth Century|last=Protas|first=Josh|year=2002|work=A Past Preserved In Stone: The History of Montezuma Castle National Monument|publisher=Western National Parks Association, Tucson, Arizona|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the dwelling was abandoned more than 40 years before Montezuma was born, and was not a "castle" in the traditional sense, but instead functioned more like a "prehistoric high rise apartment complex", as many families lived there.&lt;ref name="arizona-leisure.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Montezuma Castle |publisher=Arizona Leisure |url=http://www.arizona-leisure.com/montezuma-castle.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Hopi]] clans and [[Yavapai people|Yavapai]] communities trace their ancestries to early immigrants from the Montezuma Castle/Beaver Creek area. Clan members periodically return to these ancestral homes for religious ceremonies.

==Cliff dwelling==

[[Image:Montezuma Castle National Monument2.jpg|thumb|left|A close-up view of the Castle]]
Montezuma Castle is situated about {{convert|90|ft|m}} up a sheer limestone cliff, facing the adjacent Beaver Creek, which drains into the perennial [[Verde River]] just north of [[Camp Verde]]. It is one of the best-preserved cliff dwellings in North America, in part because of its ideal placement in a natural alcove that protects it from exposure to the elements. The precariousness of the dwelling's location and its immense scale - almost {{convert|4000|sqft|sqm}} of floor space across five stories - suggest that the Sinagua were daring builders and skilled engineers. Access into the structure was most likely permitted by a series of portable ladders, which made it difficult for enemy tribes to penetrate the natural defense of the vertical barrier.&lt;ref name="arizona-leisure.com"/&gt;

Perhaps the main reason the Sinagua chose to build the Castle so far above the ground, however, was to escape the threat of natural disaster in the form of the annual flooding of Beaver Creek. During the summer [[monsoon season]], the creek frequently breached its banks, inundating the floodplain with water. The Sinagua recognized the importance of these floods to their agriculture, but likely also the potential destruction they presented to any structures built in the floodplain. Their solution was to build a permanent structure in the high recess afforded by the limestone cliff.

The walls of Montezuma Castle are excellent examples of early stone-and-mortar masonry, constructed almost entirely from chunks of limestone found at the base of the cliff, as well as mud and/or clay from the creek bottom. The ceilings of the rooms also incorporated sectioned timbers as a kind of roof thatching, obtained primarily from the [[Arizona sycamore]], a large hardwood tree native to the Verde Valley.

==History==
[[File:Montezuma's Castle near Camp Verde, Arizona, ca.1893-1900 (CHS-4234).jpg|thumb|Montezuma's Castle near Camp Verde, Arizona, ca.1893-1900]]
Evidence of permanent dwellings like those at Montezuma Castle begins to appear in the archaeological record of Arizona's [[Verde Valley]] about 1050 AD, though the first distinctly Sinagua culture may have occupied the region as early as 700 AD. The area was briefly abandoned due to the eruption of [[Sunset Crater Volcano]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} to the north, in the mid-11th century. Though the short-term impact may have been destructive, it is possible that nutrient-rich sediment deposited by the volcano may have aided more expansive agricultural endeavors in the decades following the eruption. During the interim, the Sinagua lived in the surrounding highlands and sustained themselves on [[small-scale agriculture]] dependent on rain. After 1125, the Sinagua resettled the Verde Valley, utilizing the reliable watershed of the Verde River alongside irrigation systems left by previous inhabitants, perhaps including Hohokam peoples, to support more widespread farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Montezuma Castle National Monument |publisher=TLC Guides |url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/united-states/montezuma-castle-national-monument.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the Castle itself is thought to have begun around this time, though the building efforts probably occurred gradually, level-by-level, over many generations. The region's population likely peaked around 1300 AD, with the Castle housing between 30 and 50 people in at least 20 separate rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Snow. p.134.&lt;/ref&gt; A neighboring segment of the same cliff wall suggests the existence of an even larger dwelling (referred to as "Castle A") around the same time, of which only the stone foundations have survived. The discovery of Castle A in 1933 revealed many Sinagua artifacts and greatly increased understanding of their way of life.

The latest estimated date of occupation for any Sinagua site comes from Montezuma Castle, around 1425 AD. After this date, like other contemporaneous cultural groups in the southwestern United States, the Sinagua people appear to have abandoned their permanent settlements and migrated elsewhere. The reasons for abandonment of these sites are unclear, but drought, resource depletion, and clashes with the newly arrived Yavapai people have been suggested. Due to heavy looting in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, very few original artifacts survive from Montezuma Castle, though other Sinagua sites have remained more or less intact.

==Federal protection==

The monument itself encloses 860 acres near the geographic center of Arizona and the intersection of the [[Colorado Plateau]] and [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] physiographic provinces.

[[File:Montezuma Castle dedios.JPG|thumb|Montezuma Castle sits on the cliff face like an aerie.]]

The dwellings and the surrounding area were declared a [[U.S. National Monument]] on December 8, 1906 as a result of the [[Antiquities Act|American Antiquities Act]], signed [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm] earlier that year. It is one of the four original sites designated National Monuments by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Montezuma Castle was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an easy monument to visit, just a short distance off [[Interstate 17]], at exit 289. There is a {{convert|1/3|mi|km}} paved trail starting at the visitor center that follows the base of the cliff containing the ruins. Access to the interior of the ruins has not been allowed since 1951 due to concerns about visitor safety and damage to the dwelling. About 400,000 tourists visit the site each year. The park is open from 8am to 5pm every day of the year, except for Christmas Day.

The visitor center includes a museum about the Sinagua culture and the tools they used to build the dwellings. The museum houses many artifacts, such as stone tools, [[metate]]s used for grinding corn, bone needles, and ornaments of shell and gemstone, which prove that the Sinagua were fine artisans as well as prolific traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Montezuma Castle (National Monument) |publisher=Travelocity.com |url=http://www.igougo.com/attractions-reviews-b89935-Scottsdale-Montezuma_Castle_National_Monument.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028132012/http://www.igougo.com/attractions-reviews-b89935-Scottsdale-Montezuma_Castle_National_Monument.html |archivedate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Park Store operated by Western National Parks Association.

==In popular culture==

Montezuma Castle plays a key role in the climax of the Western ''[[Flaming Feather]]'' (1952), which was shot on location at the site.

==Montezuma Well==
{{main|Montezuma Well}}

Montezuma Well, a natural limestone sinkhole also containing Sinagua dwellings, was purchased by the federal government in 1947 and is considered a detached unit of Montezuma Castle National Monument. It is located several miles north of the Castle near the town of [[Rimrock, Arizona]], accessible from exits 293 and 298 off Interstate 17.

[[Neanderthals]] have been portrayed  in [[popular culture]] since the early 20th century. Early depictions were based on notions of the proverbially crude [[caveman]]; since the latter part of the 20th century, some depictions were modeled on more sympathetic reconstructions of life in the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/fossils/la-chapelle-aux-saints | title =La Chapelle-Aux-Saints - The old man of La Chapelle - The original reconstruction of the ‘Old Man of La Chapelle’ by scientist Pierre Marcellin Boule led to the reason why popular culture stereotyped Neanderthals as dim-witted brutes for so many years. | publisher =Smithsonian Institution  | date= |accessdate=July 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/30/neanderthals-not-less-intelligent-humans-scientists |title=Neanderthals were not less intelligent than modern humans, scientists find |newspaper=The Guardian |date=April 30, 2014  |author=Ian Sample |accessdate= March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular idiom, the word "Neanderthal" is sometimes used as an [[insult]], to suggest that a person combines a deficiency in intelligence and a tendency to use  brute force. It may also imply that the person is old-fashioned or attached to outdated ideas, much in the same way as the terms "[[dinosaur]]" or "[[Yahoo (literature)|Yahoo]]" are also used.&lt;ref name="Post"/&gt;

There are a number of sympathetic literary portrayals of Neanderthals, as in the novel ''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' by [[William Golding]], [[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story "[[The Ugly Little Boy]]", or the more serious treatment by Finnish palaeontologist [[Björn Kurtén]] (in several works including ''[[Dance of the Tiger]]''), and British psychologist [[Stan Gooch]] in his hybrid-origin theory of humans.

==Origins==

The contemporary perception of Neanderthals and their stereotypical portrayal has its origins in 19th century Europe. Naturalists and anthropologists were confronted with an increasing number of fossilized bones that did not match any known [[taxon]]. [[Carl Linnaeus]]' [[Systema Naturae]] of 1758 in which he had ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' introduced as a species without diagnosis and description, was the authoritative encyclopedia of the time. The notion of extinct species was unheard of and if so, would have contradicted the paradigm of the immutability of species and the physical world, which was the infallible product of a single and deliberate act of a creator god.
Most scholars simply declared the early Neanderthal fossils to be representatives of early "races" of modern man. [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], a future supporter of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] [[Evolution|theory of evolution]], saw in the [[Engis 2]] fossil a "man of low degree of civilization". The discovery in the [[Neanderthal 1|Neandertal]] he interpreted as to be within the range of variation of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]: ''On some fossil remains of man.'' Kapitel 3 in: ''Evidence as to man's place in nature.'' D. Appleton and Company, New York 1863&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid 19th century Germany biological sciences were dominated by [[Rudolf Virchow]], who described the bones as a "remarkable individual phenomenon" and as "plausible individual deformation".&lt;ref name="Schrenk/Müller" /&gt; This statement is the reason why the characteristics of the Neanderthals were perceived as a form of pathological skeleton change of modern man in German-speaking countries for many years to come.

August Franz Josef Karl Mayer, an associate of Virchow emphasizes disease, prolonged pain and struggle on comparison with modern human features.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kuckenberg: ''Lag Eden im Neandertal? Auf der Suche nach dem frühen Menschen.'' Econ Verlag, Düsseldorf 1997, S. 51, {{ISBN|3-430-15773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He confirmed the Neanderthal's rachitic changes in bone development[...]. Mayer argued among other things, that the thigh - and pelvic bones of Neanderthal man were shaped like those of someone who had spent all his life on horseback. The broken right arm of the individual had only healed very badly and the resulting permanent worry lines about the pain were the reason for the distinguished brow ridges. The skeleton was, he speculated, that of a mounted Russian [[Cossack]], who had roamed the region in 1813/14 during the turmoils of the [[German Campaign of 1813|wars of liberation]] from [[Napoleon]]."&lt;ref name="Schrenk/Müller"&gt; Friedemann Schrenk, Stephanie Müller: ''Die Neandertaler'', S. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Keith]] of Britain and [[Marcellin Boule]] of France, were both senior members of their respective national paleontological institutes and among the most eminent paleoanthropologists of the early 20th century. Both men argued that this "primitive" Neanderthal could not be a direct ancestor of modern man. As a result the museum's copy of the almost complete Neanderthal fossil of [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints]] was inaccurately mounted in an exaggerated crooked pose with a deformed and heavily curved spine and legs buckled. Boule commissioned the first illustrations of Neanderthal where he was characterized as a hairy gorilla-like figure with opposable toes, based on a skeleton that was already distorted with arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/lhommefossiledel00boul#page/n1/mode/2up | title =L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints - full text - Volume VI (p. 11–172), Volume VII (p. 21–56), Volume VIII (p. 1–70), 1911–1913 | publisher =Royal College of Surgeons of England | date= |accessdate=July 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcellin-Boule | title =Marcellin Boule - French geologist | publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica  | date= |accessdate=July 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.therai.org.uk/search?q=Arthur+Keith&amp;Search= | title =Arthur Keith | publisher =Royal Anthropological Institute | date = | accessdate =July 26, 2016 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170202040510/https://www.therai.org.uk/search?q=Arthur+Keith&amp;Search= | archivedate =February 2, 2017 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/fossils/la-chapelle-aux-saints | title =La Chapelle-Aux-Saints - The old man of La Chapelle - The original reconstruction of the ‘Old Man of La Chapelle’ by scientist Pierre Marcellin Boule led to the reason why popular culture stereotyped Neanderthals as dim-witted brutes for so many years. | publisher =Smithsonian Institution  | date= |accessdate=July 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hammond"&gt;Hammond M (1982).

&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- 1921 --&gt;* Neanderthals appear in [[H. G. Wells]]' 1921 short story "The Grisly Folk", which portrays them as savage and barbaric creatures who deserved their fate of extinction.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/06/04/everything-you-know-about-the-neanderthal-is-wrong/ | title =Everything you know about the Neanderthal is wrong | publisher =Washington Post  | date=June 4, 2014 |accessdate=December 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/82/depaolo.html | title =Wells, Golding, and Auel: Representing the Neanderthal| publisher =DePauw University  | date= |accessdate=December 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- 1935 --&gt;* [[Edison Marshall]]'s 1935 novel ''Dian of the Lost Land'' features Neanderthals and [[Cro-Magnon]]s as traditional enemies surviving in a warm valley of Antarctica.{{cn|date=April 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trussel.com/prehist/prehist4.htm | title =Prehistoric Fiction Bibliography| publisher =trussel com  | date= |accessdate=December 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- 1939 --&gt;* [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s 1939 short story "[[The Gnarly Man]]" features an immortal Neanderthal living in the modern world.
&lt;!-- 1953 --&gt;* [[Poul Anderson]]'s story "The Nest" is told from the point of view of a Neanderthal who finds himself in a peculiar time-traveling colony mixing people from various time periods and locations. He eventually has a crucial role in forging an alliance of people from very many different backgrounds, together fighting the story's villains - bandit adventurers from Medieval [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Sicily]] aided by 20th-century [[Nazi]]s. Eventually, he is able to return to his own time from which he was kidnapped, but finds Neanderthal society (his name for his kind is simply "The Men") too boring and settles on a career of time-traveling adventures along with a [[Russia]]n woman he fell in love with.{{cn|date=April 2015}}
&lt;!-- 1957 --&gt;* In [[Poul Anderson]]'s "The Long Remembering", a modern man undertakes a "mental time travel" enabling him to experience the life of a very remote ancestor, a [[Cro-Magnon]] hunter setting out to rescue his mate who was kidnapped by the "Goblins" (Neanderthals) living across the river. The story makes the startling assumption that [[blond hair]] and [[blue eyes]] were Neanderthal characteristics (which would imply that modern humans having such hair and eyes have more of a Neanderthal ancestry than others). This is relevant to the plot: the woman, Evavi, is unique among  her tribe in being blond and blue-eyed, which makes other Cro-Magnon males suspicious of her. The protagonist, however, loves her and would have no other wife. Fearing that the Goblins may have eaten her, he ultimately finds that in fact they had treated her with respect and even a kind of reverence - since she looked like themselves but was much taller. In the course of rescuing her, the protagonist finds that the Goblins possess no fearsome magic power (as his people hitherto believed), that their weapons and fighting skills are much inferior to those of his people, and that their land is full of game animals - all of which lead him to contemplate a scheme of conquest. In 2014, [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] wrote a sequel depicting the same setting generations later, when the process of Neanderthal extinction is far advanced.   
&lt;!-- 1958 --&gt;* In the short story "[[The Ugly Little Boy]]" by [[Isaac Asimov]], a Neanderthal child is brought into the present via [[time travel]]. Neanderthals are sympathetically depicted as having an articulate and sophisticated society and language, in conscious rebuttal of the above stereotype. In 1992 it was expanded into a novel in collaboration with [[Robert Silverberg]], adding a covergent plot taking part in the Neanderthal society of the past.
&lt;!-- 1959 --&gt;* In [[Avram Davidson]]'s story "The Ogre", some Neanderthals survived into historical times, the last of them coming to a tragic end in a remote valley of 16th-century Germany. The 20th-century archaeologist who discovered their traces came to an equally tragic end.
&lt;!-- 1960 --&gt;* [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man Whose Teeth Were All Exactly Alike]]'' uses as a plot device the discovery of a Neanderthal skull in the United States.  Neanderthals were also shown as living in primitive towns in the rural areas of the former United States in his book ''[[The Simulacra]]''. At the later part of this book, the re-emerging Neanderthals (or "chuppers")  are happy at the outbreak of [[nuclear war]], hoping that self-destruction of Homo sapiens might give them another opportunity to dominate Earth.&lt;!-- 1964 (first appearance) --&gt;
&lt;!-- 1962 --&gt;* In [[Mary Renault]]'s ''[[The Bull from the Sea]]'', the [[Centaur|Kentaurs]] are portrayed as Neanderthals.
&lt;!-- 1967 --&gt;* In ''[[Wolves Beyond the Border]]'' - a [[Robert E. Howard]] fragment, part of the  [[Conan the Barbarian]] cycle. completed by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] - the fearsome ''Wizard of the Swamp'' lives in the Pictish Wilderness and has the ability to unleash demons against his enemies. The Wizard is said to be "not a Pict but the last remnant of an old race which lived in the land before the Picts overrun it" and the Wizard's description clearly identifies him as a Neanderthal.
&lt;!-- 1968 --&gt;* [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s 1968 novel ''[[The Goblin Reservation]]'' features a Neanderthal named Alley Oop (after the [[Alley Oop|eponymous comic strip]]) brought into the future for study purposes. The novel features him approximately twenty years later. By then, he is educated enough to be working on a doctoral thesis, but still has trouble with certain social aspects, possessing, for example, a habit of breaking into closed stores when hungry and paying compensation later.
&lt;!-- 1968 --&gt;* The [[DC Comics]] character [[Anthro (comics) | Anthro]] is the first [[Cro-Magnon]] boy,  born in the [[Stone Age]] to Neanderthal parents. His father, Neanderthal caveman Ne-Ahn is the chief of his tribe, his mother a captive member of another tribe. 
&lt;!-- 1971 --&gt;* In the ''[[Riverworld]]'' series, [[Philip José Farmer]] introduces a prominent Neanderthal character named Kazz (short from Kazzintuitruaabemss), who interacts with modern humans.  His earlier novella "[[The Alley Man]]" concerns a Neanderthal whose family has survived into modern times.
&lt;!-- 1976 --&gt;* [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1976 novel ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' places a small Neanderthal population in [[Northern Europe]] as the source of the battles recorded in [[Beowulf]]. This story was also the basis for a motion picture [[The 13th Warrior]] (1999), though the word "Neanderthals" was never mentioned in the movie.
&lt;!-- 1980 --&gt;* Neanderthals appear as characters in [[Jean Auel|Jean M. Auel]]'s ''[[Earth's Children]]'' series, including the 1986 [[The Clan of the Cave Bear (film)|movie adaptation]] of the first book, ''[[The Clan of the Cave Bear]]''
&lt;!-- 1982 --&gt;&lt;!--* A main character in [[Alfredo Castelli]]'s comic book [[Martin Mystère]] is a Neanderthal called Java. Martin Mystère found him in [[Mongolia]], home to the last population of Neanderthals.  He is named after the [[Java Man]], which are actually much earlier ''Homo erectus'' remains. --&gt;
&lt;!-- 1987 --&gt;* The novel ''[[Glory Lane]]'' by [[Alan Dean Foster]] involves [[interstellar travel|spacefaring]] Neanderthals who were removed from Earth by powerful aliens to save them from extinction.
&lt;!-- 1988 --&gt;* [[Colin Wilson]] discusses evidence and theories of Neanderthal survival into the modern age, including the possibility of their recent breeding with humans, in his book ''Unsolved Mysteries''.
&lt;!-- 1989 I think ... --&gt;*Neanderthals also appear in the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' ''[[New Series Adventures (Doctor Who)|New Series Adventures]]'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] novel, ''[[Only Human (Doctor Who)|Only Human]]'', where they also show good intelligence but struggle with concepts such as [[fiction]] and [[lie]]s, and they appear to not understand why humans "are always making things up".
&lt;!-- 1991 --&gt;* The clash between the last of the Neanderthals and the emerging race of ''Homo sapiens'' is portrayed in [[A.A. Attanasio]]'s 1991 novel ''Hunting the Ghost Dancer''.
&lt;!-- 1993 --&gt;* [[Harry Turtledove]]'s novella ''[[Down in the Bottomlands]]'' is set in an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate timeline]] where the Mediterranean Sea has [[Messinian salinity crisis|stayed dry since the Miocene]], and Europe is still inhabited by ''Homo neanderthalensis'', referred to in the story as "Strongbrows" and described as "shorter, stockier, fairer", than the "Highhead" people (presumably analogous to ''Homo sapiens'').
&lt;!-- 1993 --&gt;* The short-lived animated series ''[[Cro]]'' centered around a Cro-Magnon child being adopted by a tribe of Neanderthals.
&lt;!-- 1996 --&gt;* In [[John Darnton]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Neanderthal (novel)|Neanderthal]]'', a group of surviving Neanderthals is discovered in the mountains of Afghanistan. In the novel, Neanderthals are said to possess the ability to read minds due to their larger cranial capacity, but unlike Cro-Magnons, lacked the capability of deception on more than two levels at a time. The author blamed the near-extinction of the Neanderthals on this shortcoming.
&lt;!-- 1997 --&gt;* Joan Dahr Lambert's novel ''Circles of Stone'' tells the story of a band of early ''Homo sapiens'' teaming up with a remnant band of Neanderthals to defeat a hostile band of ''H.sapiens'' who are trying to take over their territory. Set in the Pyrenees, Neanderthals are dying out because they cannot give birth to enough children; their infant heads are often too big.
&lt;!-- 1997 --&gt;* In [[William Shatner]]'s ''[[Quest for Tomorrow]]'' series of novels, Neanderthals were a primitive [[psychic]] species which caught the eye of a large alien empire, which decided to isolate the telepathic gene and transplanted several experimental subjects to another world. The original Neanderthals were then eliminated so that no one else could reproduce the experiment. The ''Homo sapiens'' were not modified. The transplanted Neanderthals eventually evolved into an industrial society; this took much longer than it did for humanity, as a telepathic species would have problems inventing complex technology without the use of writing, which would be an unnecessary tool for telepaths. In the story, Neanderthals eventually joined together and transcended their physical shape, becoming a god-like being.
&lt;!-- 1999 --&gt;* In ''[[Phil D'Amato#The Silk Code|The Silk Code]]'' by [[Paul Levinson]] (winner of 1999 [[Locus Award]] for Best First Novel), Neanderthals are still living in [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque country]] in 750 AD, and a few survive in the present world.
&lt;!-- 1999 --&gt;* ''Waiting'' by Frank M. Robinson{{elucidate|date=April 2015}}{{cn|date=April 2015}}
&lt;!-- 2000 --&gt;*The [[Races of the Malazan Book of the Fallen#T'lan Imass|T'lan Imass]] characters in the anthropologically rooted fantasy series ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'' appear to be physiologically based on the Neanderthals.
&lt;!-- 2002 --&gt;* In [[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series of novels, Neanderthals are portrayed as having been brought back from extinction by [[cloning]] to act as medical test subjects thanks to their close relation to ''Homo sapiens'' but lack of legal status as human beings. Following a public outcry at the practice, they are released to fill low-paying jobs. They have an amazing ability to "read minds" from tiny facial movements and indistinct body-language, even such details as marital status, job, and true love's identity; it is said by Neanderthals that faces can form verbs. They can instantly spot a liar, and therefore respect humans more if they say exactly what they mean, no matter how offensive or obtuse. Their art is abstract, but they can instantly understand it as if it were photorealistic. They never work, play, or even walk in the rain, to show it respect.
&lt;!-- 2002 --&gt;* In the novel ''Raising Abel'', [[W. Michael Gear]] and [[Kathleen O'Neal Gear]] tell of Neanderthals cloned back into existence in modern times, who are the targets of [[assassination]] attempts by a [[Christian fundamentalist]] [[creationist]] sect.{{cn|date=April 2015}}
&lt;!-- 2003 --&gt;* [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s ''[[Neanderthal Parallax]]'' trilogy ("Hominids", "Humans", and "Hybrids") portrays contact with an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate world]] where Neanderthals became the dominant species while ''Homo sapiens'' died out. The story begins with a neanderthal scientist being pulled into our world and dealing with the considerable culture shock - since by his moral standards, Homo sapiens are  terrible monsters. The first book in this series, ''[[Hominids (novel)|Hominids]]'', won the [[Hugo Award]] in 2003. (Sawyer's 1997 novel ''Frameshift'' used Neanderthal [[DNA]] as an element of a plot set in modern-day America.)
&lt;!-- 1980 --&gt;*''[[Dance of the Tiger]]'' by professional [[paleontologist]] Björn Kurtén, follows interactions between European ''Homo sapiens'' and Neanderthals, possible worldviews and origins for troll mythology.
&lt;!-- 2003 --&gt;* In ''[[Darwin's Radio]]'' by [[Greg Bear]] (winner of 2003 [[Nebula Award]]), a phenomenon which caused the Neanderthals to die off now threatens modern humans.
&lt;!-- 2003 --&gt;* [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s ''[[Manifold: Origin]]'' prominently features Neanderthals from an alternate timeline. This is a sequel to ''[[Manifold: Space]]'' where Neanderthal characters also appear, in a narrower context, as genetically engineered slave laborers.
&lt;!-- 2004 --&gt;* The novel ''[[Heaven (2004 novel)|Heaven]]'' by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] features [[interstellar travel|spacefaring]] Neanderthals who were removed from Earth by powerful aliens for unspecified reasons.
&lt;!-- In DC Comics' [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]], the New Gods (Metron, Lightray and Orion) came to Earth and adapted the pre-Neanderthal hominids, giving them "fire, inspiration and magic" and creating a semi-immortal king named Aurakles. The resulting Neanderthals then create a scientific civilization which covers the world, until it is destroyed by [[Sheeda|future time-travellers]]. They then revert to cave-dwelling and evolve into modern humans. --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2006 --&gt;* In [[S. M. Stirling]]'s novel ''[[The Sky People]]'', Neanderthals inhabit an alternate-history [[Venus]].
&lt;!-- 2008 --&gt;* In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s anthology ''[[Keeper of Dreams]]'', the story "Heal Thyself" describes the accidental resurrection of Neanderthals during testing of an immune system enhancement.
&lt;!-- 2008 --&gt;* In ''N-words'' by [[Ted Kosmatka]], Neanderthals are resurrected by South Korean scientists ''en masse'' and intermarry with human. 
&lt;!-- 2009 --&gt;* In "The Adventures of Cletus", a vulgar and comedic web-series of short stories, the main character is an immortal named Cletus that claims to be a Neanderthal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Adventures of Cletus |url=https://chroniclesofcleti.com/the-adventures-of-cletus/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- 2011 --&gt;* In the Italian comic series ''[[Martin Mystère]]'' published by Bonelli Comics, sidekick of the protagonist is a Neanderthal called "Java".
&lt;!-- 2014 --&gt;* [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] wrote ''The Lingering Joy'', a sequel to [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''The Long Remembering'' (see above)&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Multiverse: Exploring Poul Anderson's Worlds, ed. Greg bear and Gardner Dozois, [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;. In a world on the brink of destruction in [[nuclear war]], the daughter of the earlier story's protagonist embarks on the same kind of "mental time travel" as her father did many years before. Her main motivation is religious: to find out whether the [[Incarnation of Jesus]] was a single and unique event, or if God had before incarnated among the Neanderthals, to bring salvation to them, too. She experiences the life of a remote ancestress, a rebellious young Cro-Magnon woman who seeks to prove that she can be the equal of her tribe's male hunters. But while in courage and skill she is fully their equal, she cannot match the male hunters' ruthless cruelty. When visiting the last remaining enclave of the ''Goblins'' (Neanderthals), on the verge of final extinction, she cannot help feeling empathy and compassion for a male Goblin whose mate was raped and murdered by a male of her own tribe. And then she encounters the wondrous baby who was born to the doomed Goblins as a strange new star blazed in the sky...
* In ''Savage Eden'' by Nathan Martinez, the last living Neanderthal girl and a runaway autistic boy bond and learn to survive together as their hidden wilderness in the Caucasus Mountains is invaded by human death squads and armies on the eve of global nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Savage Eden |url=https://archive.org/details/savageden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [http://www.terence-hawkins.com/american-neolithic-1 American Neolithic] by [[Terence Hawkins]], a member of the last band of Neanderthals, who have survived into a dystopian near-future America, finds himself caught up in a hip-hop murder and courtroom confrontation with scientific creationism.  Kirkus Reviews named it a [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/terence-hawkins/american-neolithic/ Best Book of 2014] and called it "a towering work of speculative fiction."
* In the [https://jonathanbrookes.com/books/ Relic] series by [https://jonathanbrookes.com/ Jonathan Brookes], the military hatches an ill-conceived plan to clone Neanderthals to use as super soldiers for close-quarter combat. The intriguing story line shares some fascinating anthropological and biological insights and explores the social and moral issues of such a project, as well as worst case scenarios of a covert military project gone awry.

'''Omnipotence''' is the quality of having unlimited power. [[Monotheism|Monotheistic]] [[religion]]s generally attribute omnipotence to only the [[deity]] of their faith. In the monotheistic [[religious philosophy|philosophies]] of [[Abrahamic religions]], omnipotence is often listed as one of a deity's characteristics among many, including [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], and [[omnibenevolence]]. The presence of all these properties in a single entity has given rise to considerable [[theological]] debate, prominently including the problem of [[theodicy]], the question of why such a deity would permit the manifestation of evil.

==Meanings==
The term omnipotent has been used to connote a number of different positions. These positions include, but are not limited to, the following:
# A deity is able to do anything that it chooses to do.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] ''City of God''&lt;/ref&gt;
# A deity is able to do anything that is in accord with its own nature (thus, for instance, if it is a [[logical consequence]] of a deity's nature that what it speaks is truth, then it is not able to [[lie]]).
# It is part of a deity's nature to be consistent and that it would be inconsistent for said deity to go against its own laws unless there was a reason to do so.&lt;ref name="scireligion"&gt;This is a consistent theme of Polkinghorne's work, see e.g. Polkinghorne's ''Science and Religion''.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A deity can bring about any state of affairs which is logically possible for anyone to bring about in that situation.
# A deity is able to do anything that corresponds with its [[omniscience]] and therefore with its worldplan.
# Every action performed in the world is 'actually' being performed by the deity, either due to omni-[[immanence]], or because all actions must be 'supported' or 'permitted' by the deity.

Under many philosophical definitions of the term "deity", senses 2, 3 and 4 can be shown to be equivalent. However, on all understandings of omnipotence, it is generally held that a deity is able to intervene in the world by superseding the laws of physics, since they are not part of its nature, but the principles on which it has created the physical world.  However many modern scholars (such as [[John Polkinghorne]]) hold that it is part of a deity's nature to be consistent and that it would be inconsistent for a deity to go against its own laws unless there were an overwhelming reason to do so.&lt;ref name="scireligion"/&gt;

The word "Omnipotence" derives from the Latin term "''Omni Potens''", meaning "All-Powerful" instead of "Infinite Power" implied by its English counterpart. The term could be applied to both deities and Roman Emperors. Being the one with "All the power", it was not uncommon for nobles to attempt to prove their Emperor's "''Omni Potens''" to the people, by demonstrating his effectiveness at leading the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;This presents the most controversy when applied to Abrahamic Religions, since there was no word for "Infinite Power" in ancient Semitic Languages like Hebrew or Aramaic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholastic definition===
[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas, OP]] acknowledged difficulty in comprehending the Deity's power: "All confess that God is omnipotent; but it seems difficult to explain in what His omnipotence precisely consists: for there may be doubt as to the precise meaning of the word 'all' when we say that God can do all things. If, however, we consider the matter aright, since power is said in reference to possible things, this phrase, 'God can do all things,' is rightly understood to mean that God can do all things that are possible; and for this reason He is said to be omnipotent."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''Summa Theologiae'', 1a, Q. 25, A. 3, Respondeo; quoted from [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, Second and Revised Edition, 1920, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province, at ''New Advent'', copyright 2008 by Kevin Knight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121213839/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm |date=2011-11-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the scholastic understanding, omnipotence is generally understood to be compatible with certain limitations or restrictions. A proposition that is [[logical truth|necessarily true]] is one whose negation is self-contradictory.
:"It is sometimes objected that this aspect of omnipotence involves the contradiction that God cannot do all that He can do; but the argument is sophistical; it is no contradiction to assert that God can realize whatever is possible, but that no number of actualized possibilities exhausts His power. Omnipotence is perfect power, free from all mere potentiality. Hence, although God does not bring into external being all that He is able to accomplish, His power must not be understood as passing through successive stages before its effect is accomplished. The activity of God is simple and eternal, without evolution or change. The transition from possibility to actuality or from act to potentiality, occurs only in creatures. When it is said that God can or could do a thing, the terms are not to be understood in the sense in which they are applied to created causes, but as conveying the idea of a Being possessed of infinite unchangeable power, the range of Whose activity is limited only by His sovereign Will".&lt;ref&gt;CITATION NEEDED; probably St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''Summa Theologiae'', 1a, Q. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Thomas explains that:
: "Power is predicated of God not as something really distinct from His knowledge and will, but as differing from them logically; inasmuch as power implies a notion of a principle putting into execution what the will commands, and what knowledge directs, which three things in God are identified. Or we may say, that the knowledge or will of God, according as it is the effective principle, has the notion of power contained in it. Hence the consideration of the knowledge and will of God precedes the consideration of His power, as the cause precedes the operation and effect."&lt;ref&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''Summa Theologiae'', 1a, Q. 25, A. 1, Ad 4; quoted from [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, Second and Revised Edition, 1920, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province, at ''New Advent'', copyright 2008 by Kevin Knight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121213839/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm |date=2011-11-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Omnipotence is all-sufficient power. The adaptation of means to ends in the universe does not argue, as J. S. Mill would have it, that the power of the designer is limited, but only that God has willed to manifest his glory by a world so constituted rather than by another. Indeed, the production of secondary causes, capable of accomplishing certain effects, requires greater power than the direct accomplishment of these same effects. On the other hand, even though no creature existed, God's power would not be barren, for "creatures are not an end to God."&lt;ref&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'', incomplete citation.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Deity's power, medieval theologians contended that there are certain things that even an omnipotent deity cannot do. The statement "a deity can do anything" is only sensible with an assumed suppressed clause, "that implies the perfection of true power". This standard scholastic answer allows that acts of creatures such as walking can be performed by humans but not by a deity. Rather than an advantage in power, human acts such as walking, sitting, or giving birth were possible only because of a ''defect'' in human power. The capacity to [[sin]], for example, is not a power but a defect or infirmity. In response to questions of a deity performing impossibilities, e.g. making square circles, St. Thomas says that "everything that does not imply a contradiction in terms, is numbered amongst those possible things, in respect of which God is called omnipotent: whereas whatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it is better to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do them. Nor is this contrary to the word of the angel, saying: 'No word shall be impossible with God.' For whatever implies a contradiction cannot be a word, because no intellect can possibly conceive such a thing."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;

In recent times, [[C. S. Lewis]] has adopted a scholastic position in the course of his work ''[[The Problem of Pain]]''. Lewis follows Aquinas' view on contradiction:
{{quotation|His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to him, but not nonsense. This is no limit to his power. If you choose to say 'God can give a creature [[free will]] and at the same time withhold free will from it,' you have not succeeded in saying ''anything'' about God: meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words 'God can.'... It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of his creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because his power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God.|Lewis, 18}}

==In psychology==
Early [[Freud]]ianism saw a feeling of omnipotence as intrinsic to early childhood. 'As Freud and [[Sándor Ferenczi|Ferenczi]] have shown, the child lives in a sort of [[megalomania]] for a long period...the "fiction of omnipotence"'.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; At birth. 'the baby ''is'' everything ''as far as he knows'' - "all powerful"...every step he takes towards establishing his own limits and boundaries will be painful because he'll have to lose this original God-like feeling of omnipotence'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud considered that in a neurotic 'the ''omnipotence'' which he ascribed to his thoughts and feelings...is a frank acknowledgement of a relic of the old megalomania of infancy'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[narcissists]], the 'period of [[primary narcissism]] which subjectively did not need any objects and was entirely independent...may be retained or regressively regained..."omnipotent" behavior'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 509-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. W. Winnicott]] took a more positive view of a belief in early omnipotence, seeing it as essential to the child's well-being; and "good-enough" mothering as essential to enable the child to 'cope with the immense shock of loss of omnipotence'&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; - as opposed to whatever 'prematurely forces it out of its narcissistic universe'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/infantile-omnipotence |title=Infantile Omnipotence |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rejection or limitation==
Some monotheists reject the view that a deity is or could be omnipotent, or take the view that, by choosing to create creatures with freewill, a deity has chosen to limit divine omnipotence.  In [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]], and some movements within [[Protestant Christianity]], including [[open theism]], deities are said to act in the world through persuasion, and not by coercion (this is a matter of choice—a deity could act miraculously, and perhaps on occasion does so—while for process theism it is a matter of necessity—creatures have inherent powers that a deity cannot, even in principle, override).  Deities are manifested in the world through inspiration and the creation of possibility, not necessarily by [[miracle]]s or violations of the laws of nature.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The rejection of omnipotence often follows from either philosophical or scriptural considerations, discussed below.

===Philosophical grounds===
Process theology rejects unlimited omnipotence on a philosophical basis, arguing that omnipotence as classically understood would be less than perfect, and is therefore incompatible with the idea of a perfect deity. The idea is grounded in Plato's oft-overlooked statement that "being is power."
{{quotation|My notion would be, that anything which possesses any sort of power to affect another, or to be affected by another, if only for a single moment, however trifling the cause and however slight the
effect, has real existence; and I hold that the definition of being is simply power.|Plato, 247E&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230161511/http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |archivedate=2005-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this premise, [[Charles Hartshorne]] argues further that:
{{quotation|Power is influence, and perfect power is perfect influence ... power must be exercised upon something, at least if by power we mean influence, control; but the something controlled cannot be absolutely inert, since the merely passive, that which has no active tendency of its own, is nothing; yet if the something acted upon is itself partly active, then there must be some resistance, however slight, to the "absolute" power, and how can power which is resisted be absolute?|Hartshorne, 89}}

The argument can be stated as follows:
:1) If a being exists, then it must have some active tendency.
:2) If a being has some active tendency, then it has some power to resist its creator.
:3) If a being has the power to resist its creator, then the creator does not have absolute power.

For example, though someone might control a lump of jelly-pudding almost completely, the inability of that pudding to stage any resistance renders that person's power rather unimpressive. Power can only be said to be great if it is over something that has defenses and its own agenda. If a deity's power is to be great, it must therefore be over beings that have at least some of their own defenses and agenda. Thus, if a deity does not have absolute power, it must therefore embody some of the characteristics of power, and some of the characteristics of persuasion. This view is known as [[dipolar theism]].

The most popular works espousing this point are from [[Harold Kushner]] (in Judaism).  The need for a modified view of omnipotence was also articulated by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in the early 20th century and expanded upon by the aforementioned philosopher Charles Hartshorne. Hartshorne proceeded within the context of the theological system known as process theology.

===Scriptural grounds===
In the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the [[Bible]], as well as several other versions, in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 19:6 it is stated "...the Lord God omnipotent reigneth" (the original Greek word is παντοκράτωρ, "all-mighty").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/3841.htm |title=Strong's Greek Dictionary: 3841. pantokrator (pan-tok-rat'-ore) |publisher=Strongsnumbers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319205959/http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/3841.htm |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uncertainty and other views==
All the above stated claims of power are each based on scriptural grounds and upon [[empirical]] human perception. This perception is limited to our [[senses]]. The power of a deity is related to its existence.There are however other ways of perception like: [[reason]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[revelation]], [[divine inspiration]], [[religious experience]], [[mystical| mystical states]], and historical testimony.

According to the Hindu philosophy the essence of God or [[Brahman]] can never be understood or known since Brahman is beyond both existence and non-existence, transcending and including time, causation and space, and thus can never be known in the same material sense as one traditionally 'understands' a given concept or object.&lt;ref name="gita"&gt;''brahmano hi pratisthaham'', [[Bhagavad Gita]] 14.27&lt;/ref&gt;

So presuming there is a god-like entity consciently taking actions, we cannot comprehend the limits of a deity's powers.&lt;ref name="sex"&gt;Since this article deals on the all power of a deity, it would be logic to assign deities to both sexes. Since having only one sex would make a deity less powerful and thus no longer all-powerful. This article is also not (only) on omnipotence of the biblical God, there are other monotheistic religions who consider their God having both sexes ([[Shaktism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]]). These aspects are not meant literally, but are aspects of divinity to illustrate a duality just as the [[Tao]] in [[Taoism]] consists of [[yin and yang]].
Also an anthropocentric perspective seems at odds with many philosophers, such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the current laws of physics are only known to be valid in this universe, it is possible that the laws of physics are different in parallel universes, giving a God-like entity more power. If the number of universes is unlimited, then the power of a certain God-like entity is also unlimited, since the laws of physics may be different in other universes, and accordingly&lt;ref name="par"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program.html |title=String Theory and Parallel universes |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20060606234642/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program.html |archivedate=2006-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making this entity omnipotent. Unfortunately concerning a multiverse there is a lack of empirical correlation. To the extreme there are theories about realms beyond this [[multiverse]] ([[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]], [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], [[Nothingness]]).

Also trying to develop a theory to explain, assign or reject omnipotence on grounds of logic has little merit, since being omnipotent, in a Cartesian sense, would mean the omnipotent being is above logic, a view supported by [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name="rene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/ |title=Descartes' Ontological Argument |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He issues this idea in his [[Meditations on First Philosophy]]. This view is called universal possibilism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Logical Truth and Omnipotence|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/logical-truth-and-omnipotence|accessdate=20 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520215755/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/logical-truth-and-omnipotence|archivedate=20 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowing assumption that a deity exists, further debate may be provoked that said deity is consciously taking actions. It could be concluded from an [[emanationism]]&lt;ref name="eman_cath"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05397b.htm |title=Catholic view on emanationism |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1909-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805012018/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05397b.htm |archivedate=2011-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eman_hindu"&gt;{{cite web |author=M.Alan Kazlev |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/religion/Hindu_emanationism.htm |title=Hindu view on emanationism |publisher=Kheper.net |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514062547/http://www.kheper.net/topics/religion/Hindu_emanationism.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; point of view, that all actions and creations by a deity are simply flows of divine energy (the flowing [[Tao]] in conjunction with [[qi]] is often seen as a river;&lt;ref name="river"&gt;Tao Te Ching Chapter LXI Verse 140 [http://www.friesian.com/taote.htm Comments on the Tao Te Ching] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224052803/http://www.friesian.com/taote.htm |date=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dharma (Buddhism)]] the law of nature discovered by [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] has no beginning or end.)
[[Pantheism]] and [[pandeism]] see the universe/multiverse itself as God (or, at least, the current state of God), while [[panentheism]] sees the universe/multiverse as 'the body of God', making 'God' everybody and everything. So if one does something, actually 'God' is doing it. We are 'God's' means according to this view.

In the [[Taoist]] religious or philosophical tradition, the Tao is in some ways equivalent to a deity or the [[logos]]. The Tao is understood to have inexhaustible power, yet that power is simply another aspect of its weakness.

{{Citations|date=July 2017}}[[File:Orange Peel Effect.jpg|thumb|A photo of the orange peel effect on a car door. (Click for a larger photo.)]]
'''Orange peel''' is a certain kind of finish that may develop on [[paint]]ed and cast surfaces, even screen protectors.&lt;ref name=ks&gt;{{Citation| title = KS (spin casting alloy)| url =http://www.nyrstar.com/en/productsServices/products/zinc/ZincAlloysZamakProducts/Zinc-Spincasting-Product-KS/KS-Zamak2withhigherMagnesiumZincAlloyforSpinCasting.htm| accessdate = 2008-03-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The texture resembles the surface of the skin of an [[Orange (fruit)|orange]].
Gloss paint sprayed on a smooth surface (such as the body of a [[car]]) should also dry into a smooth surface. However, various factors can cause it to dry into a bumpy surface resembling the texture of an [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] peel. The orange peel phenomenon can then be smoothed out with ultra-fine [[sandpaper]], but it can be prevented altogether by changing the painting technique or the materials used. Orange peel is typically the result of improper painting technique, and is caused by the quick evaporation of [[Paint thinner|thinner]], incorrect spray gun setup (e.g., low air pressure or incorrect nozzle), spraying the paint at an angle other than perpendicular, or applying excessive paint. 

In some situations, such as interior house paint, the orange peel texture is desirable.  In this case, a texture paint is generally applied with a spray gun.  The texture is then painted over with the appropriate color.  When painting walls, orange peel can also develop by using a [[Paint roller|roller]] with too little paint or too thick a paint and the surface dries before the texture can level.

==Measurement==

The instruments used to measure orange peel simulate visual perception. Like our eyes, the instruments optically scan the wavy light/dark pattern. Two types of instruments are available to quantify the texture or waviness of a surface:

'''Orange peel meter'''

The orange peel meter uses a laser point light source to illuminate the specimen at a 60° angle and uses a detector to measure the reflected light intensity at the equal but opposite angle. The instrument is rolled across the surface and measures point by point the optical profile of the surface across a defined distance. The instruments analyse the structures according to their size. In order to simulate the human eye's resolution at various distances, the measurement signal is divided into several ranges using mathematical filter functions:

*Wa 0.1 ..... 0.3 mm wavelength
*Wb 0.3 ........ 1 mm wavelength
*Wc 1............ 3 mm wavelength
*Wd 3 ......... 10 mm wavelength
*We 10 ....... 30 mm wavelength
*SW 0.3 ..... 1.2 mm wavelength
*LW 1.2....... 12 mm wavelength
[http://i.imgur.com/BVLvE.png Simplified Measurement Diagram]

Structures smaller than 0.1 mm also influence visual perception, therefore the instruments use a CCD camera to measure the diffused light caused by these fine structures. This parameter is referred to as "dullness".

The values of dullness and Wa to We form a "structure spectrum". This allows a detailed analysis of orange peel and its influencing factors, being material or application parameters.
[http://i.imgur.com/pxD1i.png Example of a "structure spectrum"]

The detailed information of the structure spectrum as well as LW and SW became the basis to correlate to specific scales and to the DOI as described in [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E430.htm ASTM E430].

'''Phase stepped deflectometer'''

Phase stepped deflectometry (PSD) is a white light optical technique that uses a fringe pattern projected from a high definition screen to capture the reflected image of the pattern using a high definition camera. 
The sinusoidal waveform acts like a ruler over the surface allowing the relative ordinates of the light source points to be quantified as they are proportional to the spatial phase of the sinusoidal pattern waveform. By using a standard technique known as “phase stepping”  accurate measurement of each point across the surface can be made through quantifying the corresponding point per pixel on the camera. 

Using the known geometric relationship between the display, the object surface and the camera, light rays reflected from the surface can be spatially modelled to calculate the direction of the normal at each point of the surface thereby allowing the profile at that point to be obtained. By displaying the sinusoidal waveform in both horizontal and vertical directions the surface slopes can be determined in both orthogonal directions. 

By differentiating the measurement data the curvature field can be calculated allowing accurate characterisation of a surface profile. To simulate the human eye's resolution at various distances the specific band pass filtering is applied to the curvature data separating the structure data according to size:

*Ka 0.1 ..... 0.3 mm wavelength
*Kb 0.3 ........ 1 mm wavelength
*Kc 1............ 3 mm wavelength
*Kd 3 ......... 10 mm wavelength
*Ke 10 ....... 30 mm wavelength
*Ks 0.3 ..... 1.2 mm wavelength
*Kl 1.2....... 12 mm wavelength

This information is then converted into texture data (waviness) by applying standardised equations. 
Unlike other slope and curvature measurement methods, PSD is a full-field technique that does not require any mechanical movement of the device nor translation of the sensor or the surface under test; all angular and positioning errors related to this translation are therefore avoided.

'''Readgeek''' is an online book [[recommendations engine]] and [[social cataloging]] service launched in December 2010. The website allows users to search for books matching their individual taste making use of several [[algorithm]]s. Taking ratings and [[metadata]] of prior read books into account, those algorithms help the site to learn about a users preferences. The service suggests books other users with similar tastes have enjoyed, rather than offering up books similar to the ones a user already ranked.&lt;ref name=bu&gt;{{Cite news| author=

Twenty-eight states have climate action plans and nine have statewide emission targets.  The states of California and New Mexico have committed most recently to emission reductions targets, joining New Jersey, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Washington and Oregon.

Regional initiatives can be more efficient than programs at the state level, as they encompass a broader geographical area, eliminate duplication of work, and create more uniform regulatory environments.  Over the past few years, a number of regional initiatives have begun developing systems to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, increase renewable energy generation, track renewable energy credits, and research and establish baselines for [[carbon sequestration]].

==State initiatives==

===[[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]]===
In December 2005, the governors of seven Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states agreed to the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI), a cap-and-trade system covering carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions from regional power plants.  Currently (at the time of this edit), Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont have signed, and Maryland Governor [[Robert Ehrlich]] signed legislation in March 2006 that commits Maryland to join RGGI by 2007.  To facilitate compliance with reduction targets, RGGI will provide flexibility mechanisms that include credits for emissions reductions achieved outside of the electricity sector.  The successful implementation of the RGGI model will set the stage for other states to join or form their own regional cap and trade systems and may encourage the program to expand to other greenhouse gases and other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rggi.org/home |title=Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Budget Trading Program - Welcome |publisher=www.rggi.org |accessdate=2010-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  RGGI states, along with Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, are also developing a GHG registry called the [[Eastern Climate Registry]]. 

On November 29, 2011, New Jersey withdrew from the initiative, effective January 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt; "Program Design Archive". RGGI, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as Acadia Center have since reported on lost revenue resulting from New Jersey's departure, and argued for renewed participation.&lt;ref&gt; "New Jersey and RGGI: Potential Benefits of Renewed Participation" (PDF). Acadia Center. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election of Ralph Northam in the 2017 Virginia gubernatorial election and Phil Murphy in the 2017 New Jersey gubernatorial election, New Jersey and Virginia began to make preliminary moves to join RGGI.&lt;ref&gt; "Virginia moving forward with cap-and-trade plan soon after Democratic win".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; "With Christie Out, New Jersey Poised To Rejoin New England In Climate Pact".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Western Governors' Association===
The [[Western Governors' Association]] (WGA) Clean and Diversified Energy Initiative, including 18 western states, has begun investigating strategies to increase efficiency and renewable energy sources in their electricity systems.  Governors Richardson (NM), Schwarzenegger (CA), Freudenthal (WY) &amp; Hoeven (ND) serve as lead Governors on this initiative. To meet its goals, the Initiative's advisory committee (CDEAC) appointed eight technical task forces to develop recommendations based on reviews of specific clean energy and efficiency options.  The CDEAC made final recommendations to the Western Governors' Association on June 11, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westgov.org/wga/meetings/am2006/CDEAC06.pdf |accessdate=September 14, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320104451/http://www.westgov.org/wga/meetings/am2006/CDEAC06.pdf |title=Clean Energy, a Strong Economy and a Healthy Environment |archivedate=March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the WGA and the California Energy Commission are creating the Western Renewable Energy Generation Information State (WREGIS).  WREGIS is a voluntary system for renewable energy credits and tracks renewable energy credits (RECs) across 11 western states in order to facilitate trading to meet renewable energy portfolio standards.

===Other initiatives===
The governors of Arizona and New Mexico signed an agreement to create the Southwest Climate Change Initiative in February 2006.  The two states collaborated to assess greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts of climate change in the Southwest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azclimatechange.us/ewebeditpro/items/O40F8086.pdf |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320104452/http://www.azclimatechange.us/ewebeditpro/items/O40F8086.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on September 8, 2006, Arizona Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] issued an executive order to implement recommendations included in the Climate Change Advisory Group's Climate Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/press-release/4111/  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928031617/http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?%2Fpress-release%2F4111%2F |date=2006-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The West Coast states—Washington, Oregon, and California—are cooperating on a strategy to reduce GHG emissions, known as the Western Coast Governors' Global Warming Initiative. Finally, on February 26, 2007, these five Western states (Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, and New Mexico) agreed to combine their efforts to develop regional targets for reducing greenhouse emissions, creating the [[Western Regional Climate Action Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=2905574 |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629054144/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=2905574 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 six New England states committed to the [[New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers (NEG-ECP) Climate Change Action Plan 2001]], including short and long-term GHG emission reduction goals.  Powering the Plains, launched in 2002, is a regional effort involving participants from the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and the Canadian Province of Manitoba.  This initiative aims to develop strategies, policies, and demonstration projects for alternative energy sources and technology and climate-friendly agricultural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpisd.net/resource.html?Id=61 |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501132137/http://gpisd.net/resource.html?Id=61 |archivedate=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipal initiatives==

===ICLEI===
In 1993, at the invitation of [[ICLEI]], municipal leaders met at the United Nations in New York and adopted a declaration that called for the establishment of a worldwide movement of local governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance urban sustainability. The result was the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) Campaign. Since its inception, the CCP Campaign has grown to involve more than 650 local governments worldwide that are integrating climate change mitigation into their decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iclei.org/index.php?id=405#5 |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207195134/http://www.iclei.org/index.php?id=405 |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement===
On February 16, 2005, [[Seattle]] Mayor [[Greg Nickels]] launched an initiative to advance the goals of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] through leadership and action by at least 141 American cities, and as of October, 2006, 319 mayors representing over 51.4 million Americans had accepted the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulady|first=Kathy|title=Seattle dreams of 'green' team|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Seattle-dreams-of-green-team-1166626.php|accessdate=4 May 2011|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=16 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the terms of the [[Mayors Climate Protection Center]], cities must commit to three actions in striving to meet the Kyoto Protocol in their own communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/climate/PDF/Resolution_FinalLanguage_06-13-05.pdf |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320104451/http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/climate/PDF/Resolution_FinalLanguage_06-13-05.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions include:
* Strive to meet or beat the Kyoto Protocol targets in their own communities, through actions ranging from anti-sprawl land-use policies to urban forest restoration projects to public information campaigns;
* Urge their state governments, and the federal government, to enact policies and programs to meet or beat the greenhouse gas emission reduction target suggested for the United States in the Kyoto Protocol—7% reduction from 1990 levels by 2012; and
* Urge the U.S. Congress to pass the [[bipartisan]] greenhouse gas reduction legislation, which would establish a national emission trading system.

'''Resurrección María de Azkue''' (5 August 1864 – 9 November 1951) was an influential [[Basque people|Basque]] priest, musician, poet, writer, sailor and academic.&lt;ref name=Orhi&gt;Etxegoien, J. ''Orhipean, Gure Herria ezagutzen'' Xamar: 1996 {{ISBN|84-7681-119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made several major contributions to the study of the [[Basque language]] and was the first head of the [[Euskaltzaindia]], the Academy of the Basque Language. In spite of some justifiable criticism of an imbalance towards unusual and archaic forms and a tendency to ignore the [[Romance languages|Romance]] influence on Basque, he is considered one of the greatest scholars of Basque to date.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;Trask, L. ''The History of Basque'' Routledge 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

His full name is '''Resurrección de Jesús María de las Nieves Azkue Aberasturi Barrundia Uribarri''' but he is commonly known as Resurrección María de Azkue, R. M. Azkue or simply Azkue.

==Biography==
Azkue was born in the [[Biscay]]an town of [[Lekeitio]], a native speaker of Basque&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; and son of the Basque poet Eusebio Maria de los Dolores Azkue Barrundia who was from Lekeitio himself and Maria Karmen Aberasturi Uribarri from [[Mundaka]].&lt;ref name=Orhi/&gt; After having studied nautical studies in Lekeitio, he went on to [[Bilbao]] to do his [[bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] and then [[Vitoria, Spain|Vitoria]] and [[University of Salamanca]] to study theology and philosophy. He gained priesthood in 1888.&lt;ref name=Orhi/&gt;

The same year, the Foral Government of Biscay invited new applicants for the chair of Basque Studies.&lt;ref name=Orhi/&gt; Azkue, [[Sabino Arana]] and [[Miguel de Unamuno]] all applied but Azkue was awarded the position. In the following period, he initiated many initiatives related to orthographic issues and the teaching of Basque, including the two magazines ''Euskalzale'' and ''Ibaizabal''.

Although he considered himself a Basque patriot (or [[abertzale]]) and although he was in contact with nationalist figures such as [[Sabino Arana]] and [[Ramón de la Sota]], he is not considered to have been a [[Carlist]] and frequently disagreed with Arana and de Soto, particularly on Basque linguistic issues. More enamoured with the Basque language and culture, he tried to avoid politics in favour of cultural activities.

Notwithstanding, for many years there were two main camps of Basque writers and supporters of Basque culture – those that leaned towards Azkue's approach (the so-called ''Azkuezaleak'') and those that leaned towards Arana's approach (the so-called ''Aranazaleak''). Over time, the popularity of Arana's somewhat puristic approach eventually waned.

In 1904 Azkue left Bilbao to travel Europe for 5 years, with major stops in [[Tours]], Brussels and [[Cologne]], where he completed his musical studies.

On returning to Bilbao in 1909 he further busied himself with academic work (such as ''Ortzuri'' in 1911 and ''Urlo'' in 1914), boosting the emergence of the academic study of Basque. He was one of the most important supporters of establishing the [[Euskaltzaindia]], the Academy of the Basque Language, at the 1918 congress of [[Eusko Ikaskuntza]] in [[Oñati]] and was its first head from its birth in 1919 onwards.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

He vacated his chair of Basque studies in 1920 to immerse himself fully with the work of the Euskaltzaindia, pushing initiatives to codify and promote the Basque language, against considerable opposition from official quarters and the Arana camp. His main study on Basque morphology, 'Morfología Vasca' and the collection of Basque folks songs, ''Cancionero Popular Vasco'', fall into this period. He also developed the famous ''Erizkizundi Irukoitza'' ('Triple Questionnaire'), a substantial tool to elicit information on vocabulary, morphology and pronunciation of Basque from informants.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

1935 saw the publication of ''Euskaleŕiaren Yakintza'', a 4 volume collection of traditional lore and a major push to develop the ''Gipuzkera Osatua'' project.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Francisco Franco]] ordered the closure of the Euskaltzaindia but Azkue managed to avoid exile as he was both of an advanced age and not a prominent political figure. Eventually, he managed to re-open the Euskaltzaindia in 1941 with the help of the young [[Federico Krutwig]].

Azkue eventually died in 1951 shortly after accidentally falling into the [[Ibaizabal]] river in Bilbao.

==Studies==
Azkue spent most of his life studying the Basque language and his works continue to be a major source of information to anyone working with the Basque language. Most of his work focussed on [[lexicography]], grammar and popular literature. Some of his most important works include:

*''Euskal Izkindea-Gramática Euskara'' (1891). A study on the [[Basque verbs|Basque verb]] which Azkue in later years called a "sin of his youth" as it sought to present an idealised and "purified" picture of the Basque language. Although Azkue himself left this approach behind soon, Euskal Izkindea inspired a school of thought that for many years sought to promote such an idealised view of the Basque language.
*''Diccionario Vasco-Español-Francés'' ("Basque-Spanish-French dictionary") (1905). Originally published in two parts, this is the publication that Azkue is most widely known for today. It lists Basque words from all Basque dialects in unmodified form and is considered a major source of dialectal material. Azkue collected the data for this dictionary from existing sources and his own research.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt; It has been reprinted numerous times.
*''Diccionario de Bolsillo Vasco-Español y Español-Vasco'' (1918), a Spanish-Basque pocket dictionary.
*''Cancionero Popular Vasco'' (1918–1921), a compilation of music and songs.
*''Morfología Vasca'' (1923), a study on Basque suffixes. This publication too still constitutes a major source of information on morphological data, including forms and features that are no longer in use.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;
*''Euskaleŕiaren Yakintza'' ("the knowledge of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]") (1935–1947), a major collection of traditional basque lore.
*''Gipuzkera osotua'' (1935), Azkue's documentation on a standardised form of Gipuzkoan.

Between them, ''Euskaleŕiaren Yakintza'' and ''Cancionero'' constitute a major collection of Basque folklore, containing songs, poems, [[sotie]]s, children's games, tonguetwisters, customs, beliefs, folk remedies and over 2900 proverbs.&lt;ref name=Orhi/&gt; He also revised [[Lucien Bonaparte]]'s original distinction of eight dialects into seven.&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

==Contribution to Batua==
In relation to the efforts to find a literary standard for the Basque language, Azkue was a proponent of [[Gipuzkera Osatua]] ('Completed [[Gipuzkoan]]'). This was in essence a codified form of the Gipuzkoan dialect as the balance of power had by then shifted from the Northern [[Basque dialects]] to the South, with the majority of Basque speakers now concentrated in [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]].&lt;ref name=Trask/&gt;

His novels, such as ''Ardi Galdua'' ('the lost sheep'), were written in ''Gipuzkera Osatua'' and it was to be a major influence on the later development of [[Standard Basque]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">'''Robert Pierpont Blake''' (November 1, 1886 – May 9, 1950) was an [[United States|American]] [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantinist]] and scholar of the [[Armenia]]n and [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] cultures.

[[File:Robert Pierpont Blake.png|thumb|'''Robert Pierpont Blake''']]

Robert P. Blake was born in [[San Francisco]] on November 1, 1886. As a [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] Traveling Fellow, he chiefly studied and worked, between 1911 and 1918, in [[Russia]] where he mastered [[Russian language|Russian]] and began his study of [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]].  

In 1918, on behalf of the [[Saint Petersburg State University]], he arrived in Georgia to update the conflicting catalogues of the [[Tbilisi]] manuscripts and then to investigate various texts of the [[Bible]]. He became a Professor of [[Tbilisi State University]] when it was founded early in 1918. He remained there and taught the [[Greek language]] and the Byzantine history until [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Sovietization]] of [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgian Democratic Republic]]. As a volunteer he fought Russian invaders near [[Tbilisi]] at [[Tabakhmela]] in February 1921&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TbilisiStateUnversityMuseum/posts/1517472078337458|title=თსუ მუზეუმი TSU Museum|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1921 he received an appointment from [[Harvard]] of which he later became a professor. He was instrumental in promoting [[Byzantine studies]] in the United States. He also made an invaluable contribution to the study of medieval Georgian manuscripts many of which were revealed by Blake in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Mount Athos]]. He died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on May 9, 1950.

[[File:SBL Acoustic Positioning System PILOT.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1: Method of operation of a short baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning system for ROV]]

A '''short baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning system'''&lt;ref&gt;Underwater Acoustic Positioning Systems, Chapter 3, P.H. Milne, 1983, {{ISBN|0-87201-012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of three broad classes of [[Underwater Acoustic Positioning System|underwater acoustic positioning systems]] that are used to track underwater vehicles and divers. The other two classes are [[Ultra-short baseline|ultra short baseline systems]] (USBL) and [[Long Baseline Acoustic Positioning System|long baseline systems]] (LBL). Like USBL systems, SBL systems do not require any seafloor mounted transponders or equipment and are thus suitable for tracking underwater targets from boats or ships that are either anchored or under way. However, unlike USBL systems, which offer a fixed accuracy, SBL positioning accuracy improves with transducer spacing.&lt;ref&gt;The ROV Manual, Section 4.2.7 Advantages and Disadvantages of Positioning Systems, Robert D. Christ and Robert L. Wernli Sr., 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8148-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, where space permits, such as when operating from larger vessels or a dock, the SBL system can achieve a precision and position robustness that is similar to that of sea floor mounted LBL systems, making the system suitable for high-accuracy survey work.  When operating from a smaller vessel where transducer spacing is limited (i.e. when the baseline is short), the SBL system will exhibit reduced precision.

== Operation and performance ==
Short baseline systems determine the position of a tracked target such as a ROV by measuring the target's distance from three or more transducers that are, for example, lowered over the side of the surface vessel from which tracking operations take place. These range measurements, which are often supplemented by depth data from a pressure sensor, are then used to triangulate the position of the target.  In figure 1, baseline transducer (A) sends a signal, which is received by a transponder (B) on the tracked target.  The transponder replies, and the reply is received by the three baseline transducers (A, C, D).  Signal run time measurements now yield the distances B-A, B-C and B-D.  The resulting target positions are always relative to the location of the baseline transducers.  In cases where tracking is conducted from a moving boat but the target position must be known in earth coordinates such as latitude/longitude or UTM, the SBL positioning system is combined with a GPS receiver and an electronic compass, both mounted on the boat.  These instruments determine the location and orientation of the boat, which are combined with the relative position data from the SBL system to establish the position of the tracked target in earth coordinates.

Short baseline systems get their name from the fact that the spacing of the baseline transducers (on a boat for example) is usually much less than the distance to the target, such as a robotic vehicle or diver venturing far from the boat&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Acoustics, Malcolm J. Crocker 1998, {{ISBN|0-471-25293-X}}, 9780471252931, page 462&lt;/ref&gt;  As with any acoustic positioning system, a larger baseline yields better positioning accuracy. SBL systems use this concept to an advantage by adjusting transducer spacing for best results&lt;ref&gt;An evaluation of USBL and SBL Acoustic Systems and the Optimization of Methods of Calibration, Philip, The Hydrographic Journal, No. 108 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; When operating from larger ships, from docks or from the sea ice where greater transducer spacing can be used, SBL systems can yield a positioning accuracy and robustness approaching that of sea-floor mounted LBL systems.

==History==
SBL systems are found employed in a variety of often specialized applications.  Perhaps the first implementation of any underwater acoustic positioning system was a SBL system installed on the U.S. Navy oceanographic vessel [[USNS Mizar (T-AGOR-11)|USNS Mizar]]. In 1963, this system guided the bathyscaphe [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste 1]] to the wreck site of the American nuclear submarine [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|USS Thresher]].  However, performance was still so poor that out of ten search dives by Trieste 1, visual contact was only made once with the wreckage.

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is using a SHARPS SBL system to guide their JASON tethered deep ocean robotic vehicle relative to the MEDEA [[depressor weight]] and docking station associated with the vehicle.  Rather than tracking both vehicles with a positioning system from the surface which would result in degraded accuracy as the pair's deployment distance, the SBL baseline transducers are mounted on MEDEA.  yielding the position of JASON relative to MEDEA with good accuracy independent of the system's deployment depth.  The reported accuracy is 0.09m&lt;ref&gt;Integrating Precision Relative Positioning Into JASON/MEDEA ROV Operations, Bingham et al., MTS Journal Spring 2006 (Volume 40, Number 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
[[File:SCINI ROV.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2: The SCINI ROV next to its dive hole at Heald Island, Antarctica]] 

An example of SBL technology is currently (since 2007) underway in Antarctica, where the [[Moss Landing Marine Laboratories|Moss Landing Marine Laboratory]] is using a PILOT SBL system to guide the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101105151324/http://scini.mlml.calstate.edu/ SCINI] remotely operated vehicle.  SCINI (figure 2) is a small, torpedo-shaped tethered vehicle ([[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]) designed for rapid and uncomplicated deployment and exploration of remote sites around Antarctica, including [[Heald Island]], [[Cape Evans]] and Bay of Sails. SCINI system is designed to be compact and light-weight so as to facilitate rapid deployment by helicopter, tracked vehicle and even man-hauled sleds.  Once on site, its torpedo shaped body allows it to access the ocean through small (20&amp;nbsp;cm dia.) holes drilled into the sea ice. The mission's science goals&lt;ref&gt;[http://scini1.mlml.calstate.edu/goals-2/sciencegoals/ SCINI project web site, science goals]&lt;/ref&gt; however demand high accuracy in navigation, to support tasks including running 10-m video transects (straight lines), providing precise positions for still images to document the distribution and population density of benthic organisms and marking and re-visiting sites for further investigation.  

The SBL navigation system (figure 3) consists of three small, 5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter sonar baseline transducers (A, B, C) that are linked by cable to a control box (D). A small (13.5&amp;nbsp;cm L x 4&amp;nbsp;cm D), cylinder shaped transponder is mounted on the SCINI vehicle. Accuracy is optimized by making use of the flat sea ice to place the baseline transducers well apart; approx. 35m for most SCINI deployments. 

Figure 4 reviews SCINI operations guided by the SBL system.  Figure 4A is an improvised ROV control room, in this case in a cabin hauled on top of an ice hole at Cape Armitage.  From left, the displays are the ROV controls screen (A), the main camera view (B), the navigation screen (C) and the science display (D). The ROV pilot will generally watch the main camera view. He will glance at the navigation screen (C), which shows the current ROV position and track overlaid on a chart, for orientation and to guide the ROV to the location instructed by the scientist.  The scientist, shown here seated on the right is provided with the science display (D), which combines the ROV imagery with position, depth and time data in real time.  The scientist types written or speaks audible observations into the computer to provide a context for the data, note objects or evens of interest or designate the start or conclusion of a video transect (figure 4B).

A typical investigation of a site will span several dives, as tasks such as initial investigation, still image acquisition and video transects are gradually completed. A critical element in these dive series is to show prior-dive search coverage, so that a successive dive can be targeted at a previously unvisited area.  This is done by producing a cumulative coverage plot of the dive site (figure 4C).  The plot, which is updated after every dive, is displayed as a background map on the navigation screen thus providing guidance for the ongoing dive.  It shows the prior ROV tracks with color used to indicate depth. Analysis of the track data displayed here yields the quality of positioning to provide a margin of error for measurements.  In this case, the typical precision has been established as 0.54m.

[[Image:Circus Smirkus - Static Trapeze.jpg|upright|thumb|200px|Duo static trapeze performance by Kia and Lindsay (Circus Smirkus), back planche and catchers]]
'''Static trapeze''', also known as '''fixed trapeze''', is a type of circus art performed on the [[trapeze]].  In contrast to the other forms of [[trapeze]], on static trapeze the bars and ropes mainly stay in place.

Most often, the static trapeze is about 1.5 feet wide and the bar is generally 2 inches in diameter.  The ropes are at least two human lengths, as many figures are performed on the ropes above the bar.  The ropes can be made of many materials, including cotton or hemp, and often have a wire woven inside.
It can be performed by a single artist or two partners working together. A single artist will do tricks above and below the bar, the ropes playing just as important a part as the bar. A partner act will involve the partners working together — supporting each other's weight, throwing, lifting and catching each other. 

Self-standing trapezes can be purchased for home use.

[[File:CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg|thumb|300px|Triple trapeze at [[Circus Juventas]]]]
'''Multiple trapeze''' is an act entailing the use of more than one [[trapeze]], typically two or three. In these acts, multiple people perform simultaneously.
The most common type of multiple trapeze is a "triple trapeze". A triple trapeze has one long bar, held up by a ropes, basically three trapezes put together, with the middle trapeze sharing the ropes of the other two. Multiple trapeze can also refer to an abstract structure with trapeze like structures, inside which multiple artists may perform.

An experimental cage-like structure was created by  [[Cirque du Soleil]] for their show [[Varekai]], but was ultimately scrapped in production. However, the structure did appear in the 'Making of' documentary, 'Fire Within.'

A '''triple trapeze''' is a type of static (still) [[trapeze]] with three trapezes on one bar. Therefore, there are four ropes connecting this trapeze to its frame, or whatever it is hanging from. Performers specialize in synchronized tricks. One example of a triple trapeze act can be seen in [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s show [[Varekai]].

==Repertoire==
Static trapeze routines are choreographed from a number of standard tricks, movements, and positions, including:

* sitting - generally used to describe sitting on the bar, with your shoulders parallel to the bar, with both legs in front of the bar
* full beats - hanging from the bar with your hands, keeping legs straight and together, bringing feet up to level with the bar and then swinging down, through vertical and back with feet returning up to the level of the bar
* knee beats - hanging from the knees, bringing hands up above the level of the bar, then straightening the body, swinging backward down through the vertical, and back with hands returning above the level of the bar
* catcher's lock (or catches) - hanging upside down, with the bar across the front of the thighs, and the ropes passing inside the bent knees. This is generally a strong position to catch or hold another person (hence the name).
* bird's nest - belly down, arched backward, tops of the feet one on each rope above the hands, with hands still on the bar
* mermaid - similar to bird's nest but both feet on the same rope
* bird's nest in ropes - belly down, arched backward with tops of the feet one on each rope, above the hands also in the ropes (see picture)
* mermaid in ropes - similar to bird's nest in the ropes but both feet on the same rope
* angel - similar to mermaid, except one leg is released from the ropes to allow the body to face upward
* gazelle - sideways on the bar, one leg straight across the bar with the ankle past the velvet, one leg bent with the rope passing between the knee and the body which hangs backward down beneath the bar
* coffin - lying straight and horizontal with one shoulder on one velvet, and the feet on the other velvet
* candlestick - hanging from one knee over the bar, with the other flexed foot wrapped anticlockwise (from below) in the rope
* knee hang - hanging from the bar with the backs of the knees
* ankle hang - hanging with the bar behind both ankles and one foot in each velvet with the velvet in the instep
* toe hang - hanging from the bar with the tops of your feet (not normally the toes)
* neck hang - hanging from the bar by tilting your head backward to rest the bar on the back of your neck
* around the world - from sitting, one hand in the rope above the head, the other on the bar by that rope, lifting the body and rotating around the rope and returning to sit
* one-arm hang - simply hanging from one arm, usually with a strong rather than collapsed shoulder
* flag - from sitting or front balance, holding a rope in one hand, the bar in vertical position in the other hand, with rope passing under that elbow
* Russian rolls - from front balance, tipping forward and grabbing the thighs and then releasing and allowing the roll to carry you back to front balance
* Windmill - from a sitting position with one leg in front and one behind the bar, both hands on the bar, then tipping forward and rotating to return to the starting position
* splits under the bar - hanging inverted beneath the bar, both hands on the bar, the splits with one leg in front and one behind
* straddle - hanging inverted beneath the bar, both hands on the middle of the bar, with legs straddled and horizontal over the head but beneath the bar
* Pike - hanging inverted beneath the bar, both hands on the sides of the bar, with legs piked and horizontal over the head but beneath the bar
* star (or splits) in the ropes - standing with one foot on each rope, and one hand on each rope
* star on the bar - similar to back balance, but with the legs straddled to catch the ropes, and head tipped downward

'''''The Voice of Asia''''' ([[1951 in literature|1951]]) is a work of non-fiction published by American author [[James A. Michener]].  The book chronicles his travels throughout Asia, detailing the cultures and lives of locals in areas such as Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Pakistan, Burma, India, Thailand, etc.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Today Asia is of utmost importance to Americans. What happens there may make or mar us as a nation. We need to know what makes Asia tick. I had the good luck to travel to many towns and villages in Asia and to talk with the people about what worried them. I met rickshaw boys and millionaires, peasant farmers and heads of state. They told me about the religious problems, the economic questions and the social revolutions that disturb them today. I talked of America and of Russia; and, like people everywhere, they told me some very funny stories about their politicians. In 'The Voice of Asia' I have tried to share with you what the people of Asia told me." --James A. Michener &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=530632533&amp;searchurl=an%3Dmichener%26bi%3Dh%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26fe%3Don%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sortby%3D17%26sts%3Dt%26tn%3Dvoice%2Bof%2Basia%26x%3D52%26y%3D11| title=''The Voice of Asia'' by James A Michener | work=abebooks.com|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors; Or, Christianity Before Christ, Containing New, Startling, and Extraordinary Revelations in Religious History, which Disclose the Oriental Origin of All the Doctrines, Principles, Precepts, and Miracles of the Christian New Testament, and Furnishing a Key for Unlocking Many of Its Sacred Mysteries, Besides Comprising the History of 16 Heathen Crucified Gods''''' is an 1875 book written by American [[freethought|freethinker]] [[Kersey Graves]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Kersey|authorlink=Kersey Graves|title=The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors: Or, Christianity Before Christ, Containing New, Startling, and Extraordinary Revelations in Religious History, which Disclose the Oriental Origin of All the Doctrines, Principles, Precepts, and Miracles of the Christian New Testament, and Furnishing a Key for Unlocking Many of Its Sacred Mysteries, Besides Comprising the History of 16 Heathen Crucified Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGAwAQAAMAAJ|year=1875|publisher=Freethought Press|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; which asserts that [[Jesus]] was not an [[historical Jesus|actual person]], but was a creation largely based on earlier stories of deities or [[demigod|god-men]] [[wiktionary:savior|saviours]] who had been [[crucified]] and descended to and ascended from the underworld.  Parts were reprinted in ''The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You to Read'' edited by Tim C. Leedom in 1994, and it was republished in its entirety in 2001.

The book is often used as a source by [[Christ myth theory]] proponents, such as [[Dorothy M. Murdock]],&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&amp;T Clark 2014 p21-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truthbeknown.com/beddru.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Harpur]], and [[John G. Jackson (writer)|John G. Jackson]].  Many of the same theories espoused in the book are repeated in the documentaries ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]'', ''[[The Pagan Christ#CBC documentary|The Pagan Christ]]'', ''[[Zeitgeist: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Religulous]]''.

[[American Atheists]] leader [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] was a fan of the book.  While modern-day American historian [[Richard Carrier]] found the book to be incomplete, he appreciated some of its points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/graves.html infidels.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Graves, often citing ''[[Anacalypsis]]'' and other works by [[Godfrey Higgins]] (1772–1833) as his source, asserts in the book that many messiah-like "saviors" were crucified on a cross or tree before ascending into heaven.

"One thing is clear — the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and what are called their early histories are not histories of humankind, but are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines."  (Higgins, ''Anacalypsis'')

Here is Graves' main list, arranged chronologically:

* Thulis of Egypt, 1700 B. C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/PanAfrikanEducation/posts/574398409318086 Graves, p. 125]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book claims that a number of these deities or god-men shared at least some traits of Jesus as described in the New Testament, drawing the strongest similarities with Krishna.  For example, some figures had miraculous or virgin births, were sons of supreme gods, were born on December 25, had stars point to their birthplaces, were visited by shepherds and magi as infants, fled from death as children, exhibited traits of divinity in childhood, spent time in the desert, traveled as they taught, had disciples, performed miracles, were persecuted, were crucified, descended into hell after death, appeared as resurrections or apparitions, or ascended into heaven.  Graves also devotes chapters to the pagan roots of [[baptism]] and the [[eucharist]], and concludes that Jesus was not a real person.

==Quotes==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Here I desire to impress upon the minds of my clerical brethren the important fact, that the gospel histories of Christ were written by men who had formerly been Jews (see Acts xxi. 20), and probably possessing the strong proclivity to imitate and borrow which their bible shows  was characteristic of that nation&amp;nbsp;; and being written many years after Christ's death, according to that standard Christian author, Dr. Lardner, it was impossible, under such circumstances, for them to separate (if they had desired to) the real facts and events of his life from the innumerable fictions and fables then afloat everywhere relative to the heathen Gods who had pre-enacted a similar history. Two reasons are thus furnished for their constructing a history of Christ almost identical with that of other Gods, as shown in chapters XXX., XXXI. and XXXII. of this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Kersey|authorlink=Kersey Graves|title=The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors: Or, Christianity Before Christ, Containing New, Startling, and Extraordinary Revelations in Religious History, which Disclose the Oriental Origin of All the Doctrines, Principles, Precepts, and Miracles of the Christian New Testament, and Furnishing a Key for Unlocking Many of Its Sacred Mysteries, Besides Comprising the History of 16 Heathen Crucified Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGAwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA22|year=1875|publisher=Freethought Press|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==

American historian [[Richard Carrier]], a supporter of the [[Christ myth theory]], has written online about his concerns with ''The Sixteen Crucified Saviors''.  For example, Price argues that Graves often omits citations, uses dubious sources, mixes opinions with facts, and draws conclusions beyond the evidence presented. However, according to Carrier, there is no comprehensive rebuttal of the book, and although many of his facts are wrong, others assertions such as a December 25 birthdate among Greco-Roman sun gods are now acknowledged to be correct. Carrier argues there is a better case for the resurrection of Thracian god [[Zalmoxis]] (also called Salmoxis or Gebele'izis) and the crucifixion and resurrection of Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]] (also known as Ishtar), neither of whom are mentioned by Graves.&lt;ref&gt;http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/graves.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10716">The [[wikt:triad|triad]] '''thesis, antithesis, synthesis''' ({{lang-de|These, Antithese, Synthese}}; originally:&lt;ref name=Fichte/&gt; ''Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis'') is often used to describe the thought of [[Germany|German]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon]] (1986), ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford UP, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel never used the term himself. It originated with [[Johann Fichte]].&lt;ref name=Fichte&gt;"Review of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]''" ([http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/fichte/jgf-aenesidemus.html "Rezension des Aenesidemus"], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung|de}}'', February 11–12, 1794). Trans. Daniel Breazeale. In {{cite book| last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between the three abstract terms of the triad, also known as the [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|dialectical method]], is summarized in the following way in the ''Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hegel's Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis Model |pages=978 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8265-8_200183 |last1=Schnitker |first1=Sarah A. |last2=Emmons |first2=Robert A. |isbn=978-1-4020-8264-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) a beginning proposition called a thesis, (2) a negation of that thesis called the antithesis, and (3) a synthesis whereby the two conflicting ideas are reconciled to form a new proposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of the idea==
[[Thomas McFarland]] (2002), in his ''Prolegomena'' to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''Opus Maximum'',&lt;ref name=STC&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge: ''Opus Maximum''. Princeton University Press, 2002, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Kritik der reinen Vernunft]]'' (1781) as the genesis of the thesis/antithesis dyad.  Kant concretises his ideas into:
* Thesis: "The world has a beginning in time, and is limited with regard to space."
* Antithesis: "The world has no beginning and no limits in space, but is infinite, in respect to both time and space."

Inasmuch as conjectures like these can be said to be resolvable, [[Fichte]]'s ''Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre'' (''Foundations of the Science of Knowledge'', 1794) resolved Kant's dyad by synthesis, posing the question thus:&lt;ref name=STC/&gt;

* ''Are synthetic judgments a priori possible?''
** No synthesis is possible without a preceding antithesis.  As little as antithesis without synthesis, or synthesis without antithesis, is possible; just as little possible are both without thesis.
Fichte employed the triadic idea "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" as a formula for the explanation of change.&lt;ref name=Ritter&gt;[[Harry Ritter]], ''Dictionary of Concepts in History''. Greenwood Publishing Group (1986), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Fichte was the first to use the trilogy of words together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Robert R.|title=Recognition: Fichte and Hegel on the Other|date=1992|publisher=SUNY Press|page=46, note 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''Grundriss des Eigentümlichen der Wissenschaftslehre, in Rücksicht auf das theoretische Vermögen'' (1795, ''Outline of the Distinctive Character of the Wissenschaftslehre with respect to the Theoretical Faculty''): "Die jetzt aufgezeigte Handlung ist '''thetisch, antithetisch und synthetisch''' zugleich." ["The action here described is simultaneously thetic, antithetic, and synthetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fichte|first1=Johann Gottlieb|last2=Breazeale|first2=Daniel|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

Still according to McFarland, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] then, in his ''Vom Ich als Prinzip der Philosophie'' (1795), arranged the terms schematically in pyramidal form.

According to [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), although the triad is often thought to form part of an [[analysis]] of historical and philosophical progress called the Hegelian [[dialectic]], the assumption is erroneous:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Walter Kaufmann|authorlink= Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|title= Hegel: A Reinterpretation|year= 1966|publisher= [[Anchor Books]]|chapter= § 37|isbn= 978-0-268-01068-3|oclc= 3168016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Whoever looks for the stereotype of the allegedly Hegelian dialectic in Hegel's ''Phenomenology'' will not find it. What one does find on looking at the table of contents is a very decided preference for triadic arrangements. ... But these many triads are not presented or deduced by Hegel as so many theses, antitheses, and syntheses. It is not by means of any dialectic of that sort that his thought moves up the ladder to '''[[absolute knowledge]]'''.}}

[[Gustav E. Mueller]] (1958) concurs that Hegel was not a proponent of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, and clarifies what the concept of dialectic might have meant in Hegel's thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Gustav|title=The Hegel Legend of "Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis"|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|date=1958|volume=19|issue=4|pages=411–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Dialectic" does not for Hegel mean "thesis, antithesis, and synthesis." Dialectic means that any "ism" – which has a polar opposite, or is a special viewpoint leaving "the rest" to itself – must be criticized by the logic of philosophical thought, whose problem is reality as such, the "World-itself".}}

According to Mueller, the attribution of this tripartite dialectic to Hegel is the result of "inept reading" and simplistic translations which do not take into account the genesis of Hegel's terms: 
{{quote|Hegel's greatness is as indisputable as his obscurity. The matter is due to his peculiar terminology and style; they are undoubtedly involved and complicated, and seem excessively abstract. These linguistic troubles, in turn, have given rise to legends which are like perverse and magic spectacles - once you wear them, the text simply vanishes. Theodor Haering's monumental and standard work has for the first time cleared up the linguistic problem. By carefully analyzing every sentence from his early writings, which were published only in this century, he has shown how Hegel's terminology evolved - though it was complete when he began to publish. Hegel's contemporaries were immediately baffled, because what was clear to him was not clear to his readers, who were not initiated into the genesis of his terms.

An example of how a legend can grow on inept reading is this: Translate "Begriff" by "concept," "Vernunft" by "reason" and "Wissenschaft" by "science" – and they are all good dictionary translations – and you have transformed the great critic of rationalism ''and'' irrationalism into a ridiculous champion of an absurd pan-logistic rationalism and scientism.

The most vexing and devastating Hegel legend is that everything is thought in "thesis, antithesis, and synthesis."&lt;ref&gt;Mueller 1958, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820–1895) adopted and extended the triad, especially in Marx's ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847). Here, in Chapter 2, Marx is obsessed by the word "thesis";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.htm marxists.org: Chapter 2 of "The Poverty of Philosophy", by Karl Marx]&lt;/ref&gt; it forms an important part of the basis for the [[Marx's theory of history|Marxist theory of history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://scholarworks.uni.edu/mtie/vol11/iss1/5/|title=The Validity of Karl Marx's Theory of Historical Materialism|journal=Major Themes in Economics|volume=11|issue=1|pages=35–56|last=Shrimp|first=Kaleb|date=2009|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing pedagogy==
{{See also|Rogerian argument}}
In modern times, the dialectic of ''thesis, antithesis, and synthesis'' has been implemented across the world as a strategy for organizing expositional writing. For example, this technique is taught as a basic organizing principle in French schools:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nadeau|first1=Jean-Benoit|last2=Barlow|first2=Julie|title=Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong: Why We Love France But Not The French|date=2003|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The French learn to value and practice eloquence from a young age. Almost from day one, students are taught to produce plans for their compositions, and are graded on them. The structures change with fashions. Youngsters were once taught to express a progression of ideas. Now they follow a dialectic model of thesis-antithesis-synthesis. If you listen carefully to the French arguing about any topic they all follow this model closely: they present an idea, explain possible objections to it, and then sum up their conclusions. ... This analytical mode of reasoning is integrated into the entire school corpus.}}

Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis has also been used as a basic scheme to organize writing in the English language. For example, the website WikiPreMed.com advocates the use of this scheme in writing timed essays for the MCAT standardized test:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The MCAT writing assignment.|url=http://www.wikipremed.com/mcat_essay.php|website=WikiPreMed|publisher=Wisebridge Learning Systems, LLC|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For the purposes of writing MCAT essays, the dialectic describes the progression of ideas in a critical thought process that is the force driving your argument. A good dialectical progression propels your arguments in a way that is satisfying to the reader.

:The thesis is an intellectual proposition.
:The antithesis is a critical perspective on the thesis.
:The synthesis solves the conflict between the thesis and antithesis by reconciling their common truths, and forming a new proposition. }}

==Description==
Thomas Borrow was the eldest son to Isaac and Honor Borrow and was born on 3 June 1709. His father who resided at Castlefield, a very large country house, was twice [[Mayor of Derby]]&lt;ref name="ptp"&gt;[http://www.picturethepast.org.uk/frontend.php?keywords=Ref_No_increment;EQUALS;DMAG200367&amp;pos=2&amp;action=zoom Thomas Borrow], PictureThePast, accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in 1730 and 1742.&lt;ref name=glover&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BsoHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22edward+mundy%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=RA1-PA16&amp;ci=441,951,114,16&amp;source=bookclip"&gt;The history and gazetteer of the county of Derby] By Stephen Glover, 1831, accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There is a painting of Isaac Borrow extant and the Borrow house is included in a 1725 painting called [[A Prospect of Derby]].

Borrow entered Grays Inn in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/grays-inn-cn/the-register-of-admissions-to-grays-inn-1521-1889-together-with-the-register--yar/page-38-the-register-of-admissions-to-grays-inn-1521-1889-together-with-the-register--yar.shtml Admissions to Grays Inn], accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the year after Bonnie Prince Charlie came to Derby, Borrow was made the [[Town Clerk]] in 1746.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/Portrait_of_Thomas_Borrow.htm Portrait of Thomas Borrow] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030015438/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/Portrait_of_Thomas_Borrow.htm |date=30 October 2010 }}, Derby.gov.uk, accessed July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757 he married Anne Ault of [[Loughborough]] and came into the use of £4,000 and lands and property in [[Litchurch]] and the parish of St Peters.&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=026-d5369&amp;cid=-1#-1|title=Borough Estate and Family Papers - Access to Archives|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Peters parish is now in the centre of Derby. Joseph Wright of Derby painted Borrow and his wife, Anne (or Ann). Both of these paintings are in the collection of [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] as is an anonymous painting of their house called ''Castlefields''. The paintings both date from 1762-3 and are 40 by 50 inches in size.

Borrow died on 6 August 1786. They had one son name Thomas who spelt his surname Borough&lt;ref name="ptp"/&gt; and a daughter Anne Honor who died aged twelve. The parents and daughter are buried in [[St Lawrence's Church, Gotham|St Lawrence Church in Gotham]] where there is a memorial on the south wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southwellchurches.nottingham.ac.uk/gotham/hmonumnt.php Gotham monuments], Southwell Churches, retrieved 28 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="112469">A '''Unicode font''' is a [[computer font]] that maps [[glyph]]s to [[Unicode character]]s (i.e. the glyphs in the font can be accessed using [[code point]]s defined in the [[Unicode Standard]]). The vast majority of modern computer fonts use Unicode mappings, even those fonts which only include glyphs for a single [[writing system]], or even only support the [[Basic Latin (Unicode block)|basic Latin alphabet]]. Fonts which support a wide range of [[Unicode scripts]] and [[Unicode symbols]] are sometimes referred to as "pan-Unicode fonts", although as the maximum number of glyphs that can be defined in a [[TrueType]] font is restricted to 65,535, it is not possible for a single font to provide individual glyphs for all defined Unicode characters (136,537 graphic characters as of Unicode 10.0). This article lists some widely-used Unicode fonts that support a comparatively large number and broad range of Unicode characters.

==Background==
The [[Unicode]] &lt;!-- (ISO 10646 UCS) --&gt; standard does not specify or create any font ([[typeface]]), a collection of graphical shapes called glyphs, itself. Rather, it defines the abstract characters as a specific number (known as a ''code point'') and also defines the required changes of shape depending on the context the glyph is used in (e.g., [[combining character]]s, [[precomposed character]]s and [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]-[[diacritic]] combinations). The choice of font, which governs how the abstract characters in the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) are converted into a bitmap or vector output that can then be viewed on a screen or printed, is left up to the user. If a font is chosen which does not contain a glyph for a code point used in the document, it typically displays a question mark, a box, or some other [[substitute character]].

[[Computer font]]s use various techniques to display characters or glyphs. A [[bitmap font]] contains a grid of dots known as [[pixel]]s forming an image of each glyph in each face and size. [[Outline font]]s (also known as vector fonts) use drawing instructions or mathematical formulæ to describe each glyph. [[Stroke font]]s use a series of specified lines (for the glyph's border) and additional information to define the ''profile'', or ''size'' and shape of the line in a specific face and size, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.

Fonts also include embedded special [[orthography|orthographic]] rules to output certain combinations of letterforms (an alternative symbols for the same letter) be combined into special [[Ligature (typography)|ligature forms]] (mixed characters). [[Operating system]]s, web browsers ([[user agent]]), and other software that extensively use typography, use a font to display text on the screen or print media, and can be programmed to use those embedded rules. Alternatively, they may use external script-shaping technologies (rendering technology or “[[smart font]]” engine), and they can also be programmed to use either a large Unicode font, or use multiple different fonts for different characters or languages.

No single "Unicode font" includes all the characters defined in the present [[The Unicode Standard#Unicode revision history|revision]] of [[Universal Character Set|ISO 10646]] (Unicode) standard, as more and more languages and characters
are continually added to it, and common font formats cannot contain more than 65,535 glyphs (about half the number of characters encoded in Unicode). As a result, font developers and foundries incorporate new characters in newer versions or revisions of a font, or in separate auxiliary fonts intended specifically for particular languages.

&lt;abbr title="Universal Coded Character Set"&gt;UCS&lt;/abbr&gt; has over 1.1 million code points, but only the first 65,536 (the Plane 0: [[Basic Multilingual Plane]], or BMP) had entered into common use before 2000.
:''See the [[Unicode planes]] article for more information on other planes, including: Plane 1: [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]] (SMP), Plane 2: [[Supplementary Ideographic Plane]] (SIP), Plane 14: [[Supplementary Special-purpose Plane]] (SSP), Plane 15 and 16: reserved for [[Private Use Areas]] (PUA).''

The first Unicode fonts (with very large character set, and supporting many [[Unicode blocks]]) were [[Lucida Sans Unicode]] (released March 1993), [[Unihan font]] (1993), and [[Everson Mono]] (1995).

==Issues==
There are typographical ambiguities in Unicode, so that some of the [[Han unification|unified Han]] characters (seen in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) will be typographically different in different regions. For example, Unicode point {{unichar|9AA8}} is typographically different between simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese. This has implications for the idea that a single typeface can satisfy the needs of all locales.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Lunde, ''CJKV Information Processing'', O'Reilly Inc, 1999. Page 128, "CJKV character form differences"&lt;/ref&gt;
The design of Unicode ensures that such differences do not create semantic ambiguity, but the use of incorrect forms is often considered visually awkward or aesthetically inappropriate to native readers of East Asian languages.

==Application of Unicode fonts==

[[Unicode]] is now the standard encoding for many new standards and protocols, and is built into the architecture of operating systems ([[Microsoft Windows]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[macOS]], and many versions of [[Unix]] and [[Linux]]), programming languages ([[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Perl]], [[Python Programming Language|Python]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Common Lisp|Common LISP]], [[APL programming language|APL]]), and libraries (IBM [[International Components for Unicode]] (ICU), along with the [[Pango]], [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]], [[Qt (toolkit)|Scribe]], [[Uniscribe]], and [[Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging|ATSUI]] rendering engines), font formats ([[TrueType]] and [[OpenType]]) and so on. Many other standards are also getting upgraded to be Unicode-compliant.

==Utility software==

Here is a selection of some of the [[utility software]] which can identify the characters present in a font file:

* [[Character Map (Windows)|Character Map]], applet included with Microsoft Windows
* [[Font Book]], application included with macOS
* [[GNOME Character Map]], application included with the GNOME desktop environment
* [[BabelMap]], third-party software for Windows

; Note
:{{note|otftto|†}}OTF+TTO: [[OpenType]] font with [[TrueType]] outlines.
:{{note|kernpairs|‡}}OpenType fonts sometimes don't contain a one-by-one kernpair table but a kern-by-classes table where groups of similar characters are seen as one kern group. For instance, ''V'' and ''W'' have nearly the same left and right geometry. So “0” doesn't mean that no kerning is supported.
:{{note|Code2000|⸶}}Register after "reasonable" period (author's words).
:{{note|GNUUnifont|⸷}}Includes more than 27,000 Hanzi glyphs from WenQuanYi Bitmap Song font.
:{{note|HanNom|⸸}}Han Nom A covers mainly CJK U Ideographs Ext A, and Han Nom B covers mostly Ext B.
:{{note|SunExt|§}}Sun-Ext A covers 102 blocks of different languages. Sun-ExtB covers mostly CJK Supplement, CJK U Ideographs Ext B, C, TaiXuan Jing.
:{{note|WenQuanYiZenHei|⸹}}Zen Hei, Zen Hei Mono and Zen Hei Sharp co-exist in a single TTC file; also with embedded bitmaps. Latin/Hangul derived from UnDotum, Bopomofo derived from cwTeX, mono-spaced Latin from M+ M2 Light. Full CJK coverage. Included with Fedora Linux, Ubuntu Linux.

==Comparison of fonts==

Number of characters included by the '''above version of fonts''', for different [[Unicode block]]s are listed below. ''Basic Latin (128: {{nowrap|0000–007F}})'' means that in the range called 'Basic Latin', there are 128 assigned codes, numbered 0 to [[hexadecimal|7F]]. The cells then show the number of those codes which are covered by each font. Unicode blocks listed are valid for [[Unicode 8.0|Unicode version 8.0]].

:Cells shaded green indicate complete coverage.
:Cells shaded blue are not complete, but are the most complete of the fonts listed.
:Empty cells indicate that no character exists in that block.

'''Virginia Grace''' (1901–1994) was an American [[archaeologist]], known for her lifelong work into [[amphoras]] and their stamped handles.&lt;ref name="medal"/&gt;

As a result of this work, amphoras and their stamped handles are now useful as a tool for closely dating archaeological contexts and serve as a primary indicator for tracing and understanding ancient trade in the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name="brynmawr"/&gt;

Her research files are the foundation of a unique archive of stamped handles (totaling some 150,000 records) from across the ancient world and to which scholars continue to add.&lt;ref name="medal"/&gt;

==Personal life and education==

Virginia Grace was born in 1901 in [[New York City]] to Lee Ashley and Virginia Fitz-Randolph, a comfortably-off family with her father involved in importing cotton.&lt;ref name="brynmawr"&gt;http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/exhibits/BreakingGround/grace.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bg"/&gt; She attended Brearley School.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Grace_Virginia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended [[Bryn Mawr College]], graduating in 1922, after which she taught English and mathematics to secondary-school students for several years.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Virginia Randolph Grace, 1901-1994 |author=Carolyn G. Koehler |journal=American Journal of Archaeology
|volume=100 |issue=1 |date=January 1996 |pages=153–155 |jstor=506302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 she returned to Bryn Mawr interpolating her studies with a year at the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]] and earning her PhD in 1934, working with stamped [[amphora]] handles.&lt;ref name="bg"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Sara A. |last=Immerwahr |title=Virginia Grace |work=Breaking Ground: Pioneering Women Archaeologists |year=2004 |url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/results.php?d=1&amp;first=Virginia&amp;last=Grace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt;

Whilst at Bryn Mawr she became engaged to a fellow student, although they did not marry before his death (a few years before 1940).&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; She died in [[Athens]] on 22 May 1994.&lt;ref name="brynmawr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medwid, L. M. (2000) 'Virginia R(andolph) Grace', in The makers of classical archaeology, Prometheus Books, New York. pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological work==

Grace's work has included excavating [[Pergamon]], Halai and tombs at [[Lapithos]] in [[Cyprus]], and a lifelong affiliation with the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora Excavations]], starting in 1932. In 1935, she worked on the Bryn Mawr Tarsus excavations. She was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and received two [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]s to advance her research, the first in 1938. She worked with the [[U.S. State Department]], the O.S.S.
