==Overview==
''24 Hours in Cyberspace'' was an online project which took place on the then-active website, ''cyber24.com'' (and is still online at a [[mirror website]] maintained by [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/htm3/site.htm Mirror of Official site map] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221023658/http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/htm3/site.htm |date=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="undertow.arch.gatech.edu"&gt;[http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/htm3/toc.htm?new Mirror of Official Site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222030955/http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/htm3/toc.htm?new |date=December 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was billed as the  "largest collaborative [[Internet]] event ever", involving thousands of photographers from all over the world, including 150 of the world's top [[photojournalist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-19050925.html "24 Hours in Cyberspace" exhibit grand opening to feature Enhanced CU-SeeMe - Vice President Al Gore expected to attend.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wustl.edu/~listmgr/devel-l/Feb1996/0019.html "24 Hours in Cyberspace"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907175310/http://library.wustl.edu/~listmgr/devel-l/Feb1996/0019.html |date=2006-09-07 }}, February 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Second Lady of the United States|Second Lady]] [[Tipper Gore]] was one of its photographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/HTM2/4_311.htm Picture This:Tipper Gore, Photojournalist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213224634/http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/HTM2/4_311.htm |date=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, then [[Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] contributed the introductory essay to the ''Earthwatch'' section of the website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/Homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/htm3/tocear.htm Earthwatch: 24 Hours in Cyberspace] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212080732/http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/Homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/htm3/tocear.htm |date=February 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, he discusses the impact of the [[Internet]] on the [[Natural environment|environment]], [[education]], and increased communication between people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/Homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/essay/gore.htm Vice President Al Gore's introduction to ''Earthwatch: 24 Hours In Cyberspace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213224622/http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/Homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/essay/gore.htm |date=2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal was not to show pictures of [[website]]s and [[computer]] [[Visual display unit|monitor]]s, but rather images of people whose lives were affected by the use of the growing Internet. Photographs were sent digitally to [[editing|editors]] working real-time to choose the best pictures to put on the project's website.&lt;ref name="undertow.arch.gatech.edu"/&gt; The website received more than 4 million hits in the 24 hours that the project was active.&lt;ref name="byte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byte.com/art/9605/sec3/art2.htm |title=Halfhill, T.R. "Inside the Ultimate Web Site" |accessdate=2016-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961220062729/http://www.byte.com/art/9605/sec3/art2.htm |archivedate=1996-12-20 |df= }}, BYTE, May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

''24 Hours in Cyberspace'' served as a cover story for ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.247mediagroup.com/in_the_media/index.html |title=In the Media |access-date=2007-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224020708/http://www.247mediagroup.com/in_the_media/index.html |archive-date=2007-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technological infrastructure of the project was provided by a startup company spinoff from [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] named [[NetObjects]] that was founded by [[Samir Arora]], David Kleinberg, [[Clement Mok]] and Sal Arora. The system supplied by NetObjects allowed Smolan’s international network of editors and photojounalists to submit text and images through web forms; it ran on [[Unix]], relied on a database for content storage ([[Illustra]]) and used templating for easy and near-instantaneous page generation that obviated the need for the site’s editorial staff to have any coding skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; NetObjects was first to create the technology that would enable a team of the world's top picture editors and writers to become instant Web page designers. It let them do what they do best—edit and write—and automatically generate finished, sophisticated Web pages that millions of people were able to see only minutes after they were designed. Three million people clicked onto the 24 Hours site; the blaze of publicity surrounding the 24 Hours in Cyberspace project helped NetObjects raise $5.4 million in venture capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/07/08/214349/index.htm|title=NETOBJECTS WEB PUBLISHING SOFTWARE - July 8, 1996|website=archive.fortune.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project reportedly cost as much as [[US dollar|$]]5 million, and was funded with assistance from 50 companies, mostly in the form of loans of [[computer hardware]] and [[technology]] experts. [[Adobe Systems]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Kodak]] were listed as major supporters.&lt;ref name="byte" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/Homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/sponsors/indexold.htm |title=Sponsors |access-date=2007-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213224628/http://undertow.arch.gatech.edu/Homepages/virtualopera/cyber24/SITE/sponsors/indexold.htm |archive-date=2008-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
A companion book by [[Rick Smolan]] and Jennifer Erwitt was published in 1996. It contains two hundred photographs from the over 200,000 which were taken on that day. It also contains a CD with the full contents of the original website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samizdat.com/news19.html#hours Review of Internet Books: 24 Hours in Cyberspace]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alibris.com/booksearch.detail?S=R&amp;bid=9277122614&amp;cm_mmc=shopcompare-_-base-_-isbn-_-na,"24 Hours in Cyberspace", October 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smithsonian==
A photographic exhibition was unveiled at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] on 23 January 1997, featuring 70 photos from the project by the 24 Hours in Cyberspace team, [[Rick Smolan]], Jennifer Erwitt, [[Samir Arora]], [[Clement Mok]] and Vic Zaud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/02-97/02-22-97/b02li072.htm The human face of cyberspace, painted in random images]&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by then [[Vice President]] [[Al Gore]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://itv.net/archive/cyber/cyber.htm 24 Hours in Cyberspace: Smithsonian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaa.eu/company/Cisco/article/14104.html Cisco Systems And HP Sponsor Smithsonian Exhibit]&lt;/ref&gt; who was also given a copy of the book and CD.&lt;ref name="24 Hours in Cyberspace and more"/&gt;

'''''Adios''''' is the eleventh studio album released by German [[Industrial music|industrial]] band [[KMFDM]]. The album was originally conceived as the group's parting shot to its longtime record label, [[Wax Trax! Records]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8S0WdfdaJQC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=kmfdm+adios+-wikipedia+-mp3+-lyrics+contract#v=onepage&amp;q=kmfdm%20adios%20-wikipedia%20-mp3%20-lyrics%20contract&amp;f=false | title=Wax Trax!-TXT Offers KMFDM's Final Statement With 'Adios' | work=CMJ New Music Report | author=Sciaretto, Amy | publisher=Robert Haber | issue=612 | page=14 | date=April 5, 1999 | accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it ended up also signaling the break-up of KMFDM itself until the band reformed in 2002. Recorded in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], this was the last album to feature [[En Esch]] and [[Günter Schulz]], who both went on to form [[Slick Idiot]]. Following the break-up, founding member [[Sascha Konietzko]] created the band [[MDFMK]], before reforming KMFDM in 2002 without Esch or Schulz.

The album was released on April 20, 1999, on the same date the [[Columbine High School massacre]] took place. [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], the two perpetrators of the massacre, were both avid KMFDM fans. Eric Harris noted the coincidence of the album's title and release date in his journal.&lt;ref&gt;"heh, get this. KMFDM's new album is entitled "Adios" and its release date is in April. how fuckin appropriate, a subliminal final "Adios" tribute to Reb and Vodka. thanks KMFDM... I ripped the hell outa the system" -Eric Harris [http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric/writing/journal/journal16.html A Columbine Site] Retrieved September 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A digitally remastered reissue of ''Adios'' was released on May 8, 2007, along with ''[[Symbols (album)|Symbols]]''.

==Background==
The 1990s core of KMFDM ([[Sascha Konietzko]], [[En Esch]], and [[Günter Schulz]]) had reunited for the previous album, ''[[Symbols (album)|Symbols]]'', and toured together along with fellow German [[industrial rock]] band [[Rammstein]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=latimes-1997&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/10/entertainment/ca-62405 | author=Boehm, Mike | title=A Haus Divided | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=December 10, 1997 | accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The core line-up was joined on tour by John DeSalvo, [[Nivek Ogre]], and [[Tim Sköld]].&lt;ref name=latimes-1997/&gt;  ''Adios'' was written almost entirely by Konietzko and Sköld, who became an official member for the band's final release with [[Wax Trax!

''Adios'' received positive reviews.

"'''Ave Maria'''" is a much-recorded [[aria]], composed by [[Vladimir Vavilov (composer)|Vladimir Vavilov]] around 1970.  Vavilov himself published and recorded it in 1970 on the [[Melodiya]] label with the ascription "[[Anonymous work|Anonymous]]". It is believed that organist [[Mark Shakhin]], one of the performers on the "Melodiya" [[LP record|LP]], first ascribed the work to [[Giulio Caccini]] after Vavilov's death, and gave the "newly-discovered scores" to other musicians. The organist [[Oleg Yanchenko]] then made an arrangement of the aria for a recording by [[Irina Arkhipova]] in 1987, after which the piece came to be famous worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Сергей Севостьянов, "Страницы жизни Владимира Федоровича Вавилова".

A '''banquet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|ŋ|k|w|ɪ|t}}; {{IPA-fr|bɑ̃kɛ|lang}}) is a large meal or feast,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/banquet "Banquet."] (definition). [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ Merriam-webster.com]. Accessed August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; complete with [[main course]]s and [[dessert]]s, often served with [[ad libitum]] alcoholic beverages{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}, such as wine or beer. A banquet usually serves a purpose such as a charitable gathering, a ceremony, or a [[Party|celebration]], and is often preceded or followed by [[public speaking|speeches]] in honor of someone.

== Historical context ==
Overall, there is an archaeological debate of when feasting began. Archaeologist Brian Hayden argues that feasts were an important event because the surplus of food that resulted in feasts turned into social and political ties and a competition in order to display one's own wealth. During these feasts, luxury foods were offered to their guest&lt;ref&gt;Bendall, L. 2004: ''Fit for a King? Hierarchy, exclusion, aspiration and desire in the social structure of Mycenaean banqueting''. In Halstead, P. and Barrett, J.C. (eds.), ''Food, Cuisine and Society in Prehistoric Greece'' (Oxford, Sheffield Studies in Aegean Archaeology 5), 105–35.&lt;/ref&gt;. What these luxury goods were are still up to debate. However, Hayden argues that animal meat and rice are some of these luxury goods because they were domesticated despite their difficulty in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayden|first=Brian|title=Were luxury foods the first domesticates? Ethnoarchaeological perspectives from Southeast Asia|journal=World Archaeology|date=2003|pages=458–469|doi=10.1080/0043824021000026459a}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term banquet, however, termed from a different time period.

The idea of banqueting is ancient (see [[Sellisternium]], [[Belshazzar|Belshazzar's Feast]], [[Last Supper]], [[Manchu Han Imperial Feast]], and [[Mead hall]]s). In the 16th century, a banquet was very different from our modern perception and stems from the medieval 'ceremony of the void'. After dinner, the guests would stand and drink sweet wine and spices while the table was cleared, or ‘voided’. (Later in the 17th century ‘void’ would be replaced with the French ‘dessert’.) During the 16th century, guests would no longer stand in the great chamber whilst the table was cleared and the room prepared for entertainment, but would retire to the parlour or banqueting room.

As the idea of banqueting developed, it could take place at any time during the day and have much more in common with the later practice of taking tea. Banqueting rooms varied greatly from house to house, but were generally on an intimate scale, either in a garden room or inside such as the small banqueting turrets in [[Longleat House]].

Today, banquets serve many purposes from training sessions, to formal business dinners. Business banquets are a popular way to strengthen bonds between businessmen and their partners. It is common that a banquet is organized at the end of an academic conference. A [[luau]] is one variety of banquet originally used in Hawaii. The [[Nei Mongol]] provincial government in China levies a tax on banquets.

'''Bolero''' refers to two distinct genres of slow-[[tempo]] [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] and their associated [[dance]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. ''Music in Cuba''. Minneapolis MN.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest type of bolero originated in Spain during the late 18th century as a form of ballroom music, which influenced [[art music]] composers around the world, most famously [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'', as well as a flamenco style known as [[boleras]]. An unrelated genre of [[canción|sung music]] originated in eastern Cuba in the late 19th century as part of the [[trova]] tradition. This genre gained widespread popularity around [[Latin America]] throughout the 20th century and continues to thrive.

{{main|Bolero (Spanish dance)}}
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
The original Spanish bolero is a {{music|time|3|4}} dance that originated in Spain in the late 18th century, a combination of the [[contradanza]] and the [[sevillana]].

=== Art music boleros ===
[[File:Antonio Cabral Bejarano. A Bolero dancer.jpg|thumb|A bolero dancer by [[Antonio Cabral Bejarano]], 1842]]
There are many so-called boleros in [[art music]] (i.e., classical music), which are primarily inspired in the original Spanish genre of the same name.

* [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'' is one of his most famous works, originally written as a ballet score commissioned by Ida Rubinstein, but now usually played as a concert piece. It was originally called ''[[Fandango]]'' but has rhythmic similarities with the Spanish dance form as described in this article, being in a constant {{music|time|3|4}} time with a prominent triplet on the second beat of every bar.
* [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] wrote a [[Bolero (Chopin)|bolero for solo piano]] (Op. 19), but its rhythms are more that of the [[polonaise]].  He was a close friend of [[Pauline Viardot]], the daughter of the famed Spanish tenor [[Manuel García (tenor)|Manuel García]], who had introduced the bolero to Paris
* [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] wrote a bolero in ''La Soirée dans Grenada''
* [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]] wrote a bolero in ''[[Carmen]]''
* [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]] wrote a bolero, ''El desdichado'', for 2 voices and orchestra
* [[Moritz Moszkowski|Moszkowski]]'s first set of Spanish Dances (Op. 12) ends with a bolero.
* [[Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély|Lefébure-Wély]] wrote ''Boléro de Concert'' for organ
* The bolero from [[Hervé (composer)|Hervé]]'s ''[[Chilpéric (operetta)|Chilpéric]]'' has been immortalized in [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]]'s famous painting (above).
* [[Friedrich Baumfelder]] wrote a Premier Bolero, Op. 317, for piano.
* [[Richard Aaker Trythall]] wrote a bolero for four percussionists based on the rhythm and structure of the traditional bolero dance. Trythall imagined the four percussionists as four dancers, intertwining their solos, duets, and trios with moments of group ensemble work in the same way a choreographer might have done.
* [[Charles-Auguste de Beriot]] wrote a bolero in his concerto "Scene de Ballet" for violin and piano (or orchestra).
* English banjo composer [[Joe Morley]] wrote a bolero titled "El Contrabandista" after noted banjoist and composer Alfred Cammeyer published a bolero in {{music|time|4|4}} time for banjo.  Morley composed his as a true bolero in {{music|time|3|4}} time.
* [[John Serry Sr.]] composed his ''African Bolero'' for accordion and flute in 1950.
* [[Fumio Hayasaka]] composed a bolero for the [[Akira Kurosawa]] film ''[[Rashomon]]'' in 1950.{{cn|date=November 2018}}
* [[Keith Emerson]] composed his ''Abaddon's Bolero'' for Orchestra and Synthesizer in 1972. 

In some [[art music]] boleros, the root lies not in the bolero but in the [[Habanera (music)|habanera]], a Cuban precursor of the [[History of Tango|tango]], which was a favourite dance rhythm in the mid-19th century, and occurs often in French [[opera]] and Spanish [[zarzuela]] of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Loyola Fernández, Jose 1997. ''En ritmo de bolero: el bolero en la musica bailable cubana''. Huracan, Rio Piedras, P.R. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cuba ==
[[Image:Sanchez+Blez.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Pepe Sánchez (guitar, left) and Emiliano Blez (tres) with three singers (standing)]]
In [[Cuba]], the bolero was perhaps the first great Cuban musical and vocal synthesis to win universal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Acosta, Leonardo 1987. ''From the drum to the synthesiser''. La Habana. p121&lt;/ref&gt; In {{music|time|2|4}} time, this dance music spread to other countries, leaving behind what Ed Morales has called the "most popular lyric tradition in Latin America".&lt;ref name="Morales, p120"&gt;Morales, p120&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban bolero tradition originated in [[Santiago de Cuba]] in the last quarter of the 19th century;&lt;ref&gt;Cristobal Diaz offers 1885: "el bolero, creado aproximadamente para 1885". Diaz Ayala, Cristobal 1999. ''Cuando sali de la Habana 1898-1997: cien anos de musica cubana por el mundo''. 3rd ed, Cubanacan, San Juan P.R. p24-25&lt;/ref&gt; it does not owe its origin to the Spanish music and song of the same name.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the 19th century there grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar.

[[Pepe Sanchez (trova)|Pepe Sanchez]] is known as the father of the ''[[trova]]'' style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. Untrained, but with remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost, but two dozen or so survive because friends and students wrote them down. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 2004. ''Cuban music from A to Z.'' p195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 1995. ''El bolero latino''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread in Latin America===
[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]], a prolific Ecuadorian bolero singer and recording artist who performed throughout [[Latin America]].]]
The Cuban bolero has traveled to Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Venezuela and the rest of Latin America after its conception, where it became part of their repertoires. Some of the bolero's leading composers have come from nearby countries, as in the case of the prolific [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rica]]n composer [[Rafael Hernández Marín|Rafael Hernández]] and the Mexican [[Agustín Lara]]. Some Cuban composers of the bolero are primarily considered trovadores.&lt;ref&gt;Loyola Fernandez, Jose 1996. ''El ritmo en bolero: el bolero en la musica bailable cubana''. Huracan, Rio Piedras P.R.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 1992. ''300 boleros de oro''. Mexico City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo Duque, Hernán 1992. ''Lo que cantan los boleros''. Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rico Salazar, Jaime 1999. ''Cien años de boleros: su historia, sus compositores, sus mejores interpretes y 700 boleros inolvidables''. 5th ed, Bogotá.&lt;/ref&gt; Several lyric tenors also contributed to the popularization of the bolero throughout North and South America  during the 1930s and the 1940s through live concerts and performances on international radio networks. Included in this group were the Mexican operatic tenors: [[Juan Arvizu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lzmTAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:sZtJSSJbdm4C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9sOe62dXZAhXPct8KHYJeCmcQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Juan+Arvizu&amp;f=false|title=Agustin Lara: A Cultural Biography|first=Andrew Grant|last=Wood|date=13 June 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todotango.com/creadores/biografia/1585/Juan-Arvizu/ ''Juan Arvizu - Biography in Todo Tango'' - Juan Arvizu Biography yand Bolero/Tango en tototango.com]{{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GB03DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT656&amp;dq=Juan+Arvizu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbjcLn-N3ZAhVwm-AKHbKJB-Q4ChDoAQgxMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Juan+Arvizu&amp;f=false|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean|first1=Dale A.|last1=Olsen|first2=Daniel E.|last2=Sheehy|date=25 September 2017|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Media Sound &amp; Culture in Latin America.''

Boleros saw a resurgence in popularity during the 1990s when Mexican singer [[Luis Miguel]] was credited for reviving interest in the bolero genre following the release ''[[Romance (Luis Miguel album)|Romance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ageless+romance+with+bolero.-a017482173|title=Ageless Romance with Bolero|last=Holston|first=Mark|work=Américas|publisher=Organization of American States|date=September 1, 1995|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bolero fusions ====
José Loyola comments that the frequent fusions of the bolero with other Cuban rhythms is one of the reasons it has been so fertile for such a long period of time:
:"La adaptación y fusión del bolero con otros géneros de la música popular bailable ha contribuido al desarrollo del mismo, y a su vigencia y contemporaneidad."&lt;ref&gt;Loyola Fernandez, José 1996. ''El ritmo en bolero: el bolero en la musica bailable cubana''. Huracan, Rio Piedras P.R. p249&lt;/ref&gt;

:(The adaptation and fusion of the bolero with other types of popular dance music has contributed to their development, and to its endurance and timelessness.)

This adaptability was largely achieved by dispensing with limitations in format or instrumentation, and by an increase in syncopation (so producing a more afrocuban sound). Examples would be:
*Bolero in the ''danzón'': the advent of lyrics in the danzón to produce the ''danzonete''.
*The ''bolero-son'': long-time favourite dance music in Cuba, captured abroad under the misnomer 'rumba'.
*The ''bolero-mambo'' in which slow and beautiful lyrics were added to the sophisticated big-band arrangements of the mambo.
*The ''bolero-cha'': many cha-cha-cha lyrics come from boleros.

The lyrics of the bolero can be found throughout popular music, especially Latin dance music.

=== Vietnam ===
Bolero music has also spread to [[Vietnam]]. In the 1930s, the nation grew fond of modern music, which combined Western elements with traditional music. Vietnamese bolero is generally slower tempo compared to Latin bolero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Theo Tiền Phong|title=Trí thức cũng nghe nhạc vàng|url=http://www.thanhnien.com.vn/van-hoa-nghe-thuat/tri-thuc-cung-nghe-nhac-vang-181742.html|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=Vietnamese|date=26 August 2010|quote=Bolero Việt Nam rất chậm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such music was romantic, expressing concepts of feelings, love, and life in a poetic language;&lt;ref name="vnn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chánh|first1=Minh|title=Bolero – một lịch sử tình ca|url=http://vietnamnet.vn/vn/giai-tri/bolero-mot-lich-su-tinh-ca-67870.html|website=VietnamNet|accessdate=2 November 2017|language=Vietnamese|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this predisposition was hated by [[Viet Minh]], who strived towards shaping the working class at the time.&lt;ref name="diplomat"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Revival of Boléro in Vietnam|last=Duy|first=Dinh|url=https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/the-revival-of-bolero-in-vietnam/|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=''[[The Diplomat]]''|publisher=The Diplomat|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This genre became colloquially known as ''[[Yellow Music#Vietnam|yellow music]]'', in opposition to the ''red music'' endorsed by the Communist government of [[Hanoi]] during the era of the [[Vietnam War]].  As a result of [[North Vietnam]] winning the war, the music was banned in 1975. Those caught listening to ''yellow music'' would be punished, and their music confiscated. After the [[Fall of Saigon]], many Vietnamese migrated to the United States, taking their music with them. The ban was lightened in 1986, when love songs could be written again, but by then the music industry was killed.&lt;ref name="diplomat"/&gt;

The government of Vietnam also prohibited the sale of overseas Vietnamese music, including variety shows like ''Asia'' and ''[[Paris by Night]]''. In recent years however, bolero had grown popular again, as more overseas singers performed in Vietnam. Additionally, singing competition television series like ''Boléro Idol'' have grown popular, with singers performing songs, including those formerly banned.&lt;ref name="diplomat"/&gt;

== Ballroom dance ==
{{Main|Rhumba}}
=== International ballroom ===
A version of the Cuban bolero is danced throughout the [[Latin dance]] world (supervised by the [[World Dance Council]]) under the misnomer '[[Rhumba|rumba]]'. This came about in the early 1930s when a simple overall term was needed to market Cuban music to audiences unfamiliar with the various Cuban musical terms. The famous ''[[Peanut Vendor]]'' was so labelled, and the label stuck for other types of Cuban music.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Ayala, Cristobal 1981. ''Música cubana del Areyto a la Nueva Trova''. 2nd rev ed, Cubanacan, San Juan P.R.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned 2004. ''Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo''. Chicago. Chapter 27 The Peanut Vendor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cuba, the bolero is usually written in {{music|time|2|4}} time, elsewhere often {{music|time|4|4}}. The tempo for dance is about 120 beats per minute. The music has a gentle Cuban rhythm related to a slow ''[[Son Cubano|son]]'', which is the reason it may be best described as a bolero-son. Like some other Cuban dances, there are three steps to four beats, with the first step of a figure on the second beat, not the first. The ''slow'' (over the two beats four and one) is executed with a hip movement over the standing foot, with no foot-flick.&lt;ref&gt;Lavelle, Doris 1983. ''Latin &amp; American dances''. 3rd ed, Black, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Rhythm ===
The dance known as bolero is  one of the [[competition dance]]s in [[American Rhythm]] ballroom dance category. The first step is typically taken on the first beat, held during the second beat with two more steps falling on beats three and four (cued as "slow-quick-quick").  In competitive dance the music is in {{music|time|4|4}} time and will range between 96 and 104 bpm. This dance is quite different from the other American Rhythm dances in that it not only requires [[cuban motion]] but [[rises and falls]] such as found in [[waltz]] and [[contra body movement]].&lt;ref&gt;W.D. Eng, Inc. dba Dance Vision 2003. ''American Style Rhythm Bronze Manual'', Las Vegas, Nevada.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular music for this dance style need not be Latin in origin. Lists of music used in competitions for American Rhythm Bolero are available.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/ballroomchallenge/competition-s1-music.html List of Songs used in [[America's Ballroom Challenge]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''book town''' is a town or village with a large number of [[used book]] or antiquarian [[Used bookstore|book stores]]. These [[Bookselling|stores]], as well as [[literary festival]]s, attract [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] tourists. A number of the book towns are members of the International Organisation of Book Towns.

[[Image:Cara mujer.JPG|thumb|170px|right|A 1992 blurry image of a woman in ''The House of the Faces'']]The '''Bélmez Faces''' or the '''Faces of Bélmez''' is an alleged [[paranormal]] phenomenon in a private house in Spain which started in 1971 when residents claimed images of faces appeared in the concrete floor of the house. 

Located at the Pereira family home at Calle Real 5, [[Bélmez de la Moraleda]], [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén]], Andalusia, Spain, the Bélmez faces have been responsible for bringing large numbers of sightseers to Bélmez.

Various faces have supposedly appeared and disappeared at irregular intervals since 1971 and have been frequently photographed by the local newspapers and curious visitors.  Many Bélmez residents believe that the faces were not made by human hand. Some paranormal investigators believe that it is a [[thoughtography|thoughtographic]] phenomenon, subconsciously produced by the deceased former owner of the house, María Gómez Cámara.

[[Scientific skepticism|Skeptical researchers]] have performed extensive tests on the faces and believe that they are fabrications possibly created as part of a [[hoax]]. It is suspected that the Pereira family may have perpetrated the hoax for financial gain.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (1993). ''Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions &amp; Healing Cures''. Prometheus Books. pp. 38–40. {{ISBN|1-57392-680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tort| first = César| authorlink = | title =  Bélmez Faces Turned Out to Be Suspiciously Picture-like Images | journal =  [[Skeptical Inquirer]]| volume = (2)| issue = Mar/Apr | page = 4 | series = 19| publisher = | location =  | year = 1995| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Reports of appearances in Bélmez began on 23 August 1971, when María Gómez Cámara claimed that a human face formed spontaneously on her concrete kitchen floor. María's husband, Juan Pereira and their son, Miguel, destroyed the image with a pickaxe and new concrete was laid down. However, the Pereira story goes, a new face formed on the floor. The mayor of Bélmez was informed and forbade the destruction of the new face.  Instead, the floor concrete was cut out and taken for study.

María's home was advertised to the tourists as ''La Casa de las Caras'' (The House of the Faces). By Easter of 1972 hundreds of people were flocking to the house to see the faces. For the next 30 years the Pereira family claimed that faces continued to appear, both male and female and of different shapes, sizes and expressions.

==The investigations==
There have been several investigations into the Bélmez case:

===The forgery hypothesis===
In an article published in the July 1993 issue of the ''[[Society for Psychical Research|Journal of the Society for Psychical Research]]'' Luis Ruiz-Noguez noted that the presence of three cations used as pigments in the manufacture of paint must be mentioned: zinc, lead and chromium.  Two of these, lead and chromium, lay the foundation for suspecting the use of paint in making the Bélmez faces.  Ruiz-Noguez postulated that lead was used for several reasons:
# Lead was, for many years, the most commonly used pigment in making the primary colors.
# The percentage of chromium in the analysis is too low to be a viable option.
# Lead tends to cause dark, difficult-to-see colorations; something that does not happen in chromium.
# The most common and cheapest primary colors are enamels, that contain lead; besides, these enamels are widely used in the home, since they are easy to apply.

Directly contradicting what Carballal says, the ICV analysis does not demonstrate the non-existence of paint.  On the other hand, Ruiz-Noguez also points to several objections to the hypothesis of utilization of paint on the ICV samples: alkydalic-type enamels do not withstand abrasion; paint leaves a film that is easily differentiated from the substratum; and the alkydalics' chemical tolerance to acids, alkalis and detergents is low.&lt;ref&gt;Tort, Cesar in ''Journal of the Society for Psychical Research'' (op. cit.), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel Martín Serrano, a sociologist at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]], wrote a laborious study, ''Sociología del Milagro'' (Sociology of the miracle): the first book that a skeptic has written about this case exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Serrano | first = Manuel Martín| title = Sociología del milagro: las caras de Belmez (Barcelona:  Barral Editores)| year = 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his book Serrano interviews dozens of Bélmez inhabitants but he never mentions anyone by name.  However, Serrano's study is a contribution to explain the social dynamics of what he believes was a hoax perpetrated for financial gain.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. |pages=358ff esp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although José Luis Jordán was vice-president of the Spanish Society of Parapsychology, he was rather skeptical.  In Jordán's ''Casas Encantadas, Poltergeist'' he analyzes cases of supposed [[haunted house]]s in Spain, including the Bélmez case.

In 1971, a department of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of the Interior]] asked Jordán to head a commission that appointed diverse technicians specializing in concrete chemistry to carry out an exhaustive study of the strange occurrences in Bélmez and present a report on such to the authorities.  In the report Jordán deals with several possibilities of fraud: "pigmentation with a dark, brownish substance", "a mixture of soot and vinegar" and "the aggressive action of a chemical compound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jordán | first = José Luis| title =Casas encantadas, poltergeist (Barcelona: Noguer)| year = 1982 |pages=144–46}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview by two members of the Spanish Society of Parapsychology, Jordán stated:

{{quote|With regard to the enigma of the chemical procedure, I solved it by discovering that this compound can be found in any drugstore by asking for a German product to remove concrete stains.  [The mystery] that the images were invisible and latent for some time is thereby solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Jiménez  | first = Iker  |author2=Lorenzo Fernández  | title = unknown?  | journal = Jaén  | pages = 56–57  | date = 5 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Spain other skeptical parapsychologists have also maintained the forgery hypothesis. Ramos Perera, president of the Spanish Society of Parapsychology, stated that it was found that ''La Pava'', the first and most famous of the Bélmez faces, had coloration and deduced it had been painted:

{{quote|Through infrared photography we saw that this one had added pigmentation [over the original appearance], and even the paint brush bristles could be perceived. Of course, after that we had no doubts it had been painted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorialbitacora.com/bitacora/ramos/ramos.htm ''El Testigo Incómodo de Bélmez''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512190754/http://www.editorialbitacora.com/bitacora/ramos/ramos.htm |date=12 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''La Pava'' was later embedded in the wall of María's home for exhibition purposes.

Besides the ICV's, there are other chemical analysis on the Bélmez faces, performed by J.J. Alonso, a researcher of the Spanish National Research Council.  The Alonso report was originally published in ''Psi Comunicación'', the journal of the Spanish Society of Parapsychology. However, the results are ambiguous on the subject of how the images were formed. Also, Alonso refused to wield judgment on the thoughtographic claims.  However, his analysis did confirm the presence of a melanocratic compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Alonso  | first = J.J.  | title =Informe acerca de unas muestras traídas para su análisis al Instituto Hidrológico y Mineralógico de Valencia  | series = 2  | journal = Psi Comunicación  | volume = (3/4)  | pages = 77–80  | year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, artificial cement is made from limestone, clay and gypsum (natural cements are obtained from rocks containing lime and clay).  The main components are lime and kaolinitic clay.  There are some cements such as the aluminous, derived from aluminous and lime materials, that are black (melanocratic).  The presence of aluminum in the analysis of the Bélmez face called ''El Pelao'' (The bald one) could indicate that an aluminum-type cement was being dealt with.  However, in his report Alonso does not indicate the percentage of said cation, nor its structure, resistance to compression, elasticity module, chemical resistance or other characteristics necessary to differentiate a Portland cement from an aluminum cement.

===The thoughtographic hypothesis===
The main researchers of the Bélmez case were [[Hans Bender]] and [[:es:Germán de Argumosa|Germán de Argumosa]].  They collaborated in Bélmez and Freiburg in the early 1970s when the alleged phenomena began.  Neither Bender nor de Argumosa published an official report on them.  Bender wrote very little about the case in his journal ''Zeitschrift für Parapsychologie''.  Argumosa, a Spanish parapsychologist, spent two years evaluating what he believed was a Gothic mystery, but published nothing on the subject either.  Bender did mention the case in passing and referred to it in some of his lectures.  His crucial statement referred to the sealing of areas of the floor where some faces were in progress with a transparent plastic material:

{{quote|In Bélmez, slight changes of the faces' configuration during the period when the phenomenon was under seal (attested by a notary) have contributed to ensure its paranormal origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Bender  | first = Hans  | title = Rundbrief  | journal = Institute for Border Areas of Psychology and Psycho-Hygiene's newsletter  |date=December 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The only believer who has published an entire book on the case is José Martínez-Romero.  His book ''Las Caras de Bélmez'' is a collection of anecdotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Martínez Romero | first = José| title = Las caras de Bélmez (Barcelona: Martínez Roca)| year = 1978}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Martínez-Romero is not worried about falsifying the paranormal hypothesis.  (An advantage of this and other cases of alleged thoughtographic appearances is that, as the paranormal interpretation is [[falsifiable]], it is not a pseudo-scientific hypothesis.)&lt;ref&gt;The concept of the hypothetical "permanent paranormal object" is explained in chapter "What is to count as good evidence for the paranormal" in {{cite book | last = Beloff | first = John| title = The Relentless Question (McFarland &amp; Co)| year = 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Argumosa himself, who used to be the main defender of this case in Spain, believes that Martínez-Romero discredited the phenomenon with his book.&lt;ref&gt;De Argumosa, quoted in {{cite journal  | last = Tort  | first = César, J.  |author2=Luis Ruiz Noguez  | title = Are the faces of Bélmez permanent paranormal objects?  | journal = Journal of the Society for Psychical Research  | volume = 59  | pages = 161–71  | year = 1993}} (p.163)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most serious publication to date by a believer appears in the first chapter of the book ''The Seen and the Unseen'' by [[Andrew Carr MacKenzie]].  MacKenzie did not speak Spanish and during his stay in Bélmez lacked an interpreter.  Only a taxi driver and Martínez-Romero's son were able to assist him, though very little.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacKenzie | first = Andrew| title = The seen and the unseen (London:  Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson)| year = 1987 |pages=23–41}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific studies carried out on a Bélmez face were performed by the ''Instituto de Cerámica y Vidrio'' or ICV (Institute of Ceramics and Glass), with samples from two of the faces recovered by Father J.M. Pilón's team in September 1990.  The samples, one 30 milligrams, the other 60 milligrams, were subjected to various tests such as granulometric, mineralogical and chemical.  According to Carballal, "The result, expressed in extremely abridged form, was that no traces of paint were found at any place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Carballal  | first = Manuel  | journal =   | title = Más Allá  | volume = 37  | pages = 36–43  | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carballal does not mention which faces were analyzed, nor which part of the faces correspond to each of the samples, nor what kind of mineralogical or chemical analysis was performed.

Despite the fact that ICV is a respectable institution that belongs to the [[Spanish National Research Council]], in 1992 Pilón published the above chart in the popular Spanish magazine ''[[:es:Más allá de la Ciencia|Más Allá]]''.

====Conclusions====
Luis Ruiz-Noguez believes that the most likely explanation for the visual effect of the Bélmez images is Jordán's suggestion of the use of an oxidizing chemical agent.  For example, nitric, sulfuric, muriatic, acetic acid, and others, could be used to obtain such an effect.  Another explanation might be the use of agents sensitive to light (which was not mentioned in either Jordán's or Perera's repertoire of forgery hypotheses): silver nitrate which, when subjected to ultraviolet sunlight, darkens.&lt;ref&gt;Tort, Cesar in ''Journal of the Society for Psychical Research'' (op. cit.), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, there may be at least three chemical sources capable of producing an effect similar to that of the Bélmez faces: (1) Products that affect the chemical structure of the cement which include some oxidizing agents and several acids (all types of cement are of alkaline nature and therefore easily attacked by acids); (2) products that leave the cement intact but change their chemical structure upon contact with external agents such as light or chemical reagents; and (3) the utilization of a pigment in a vehicle or resin, as discussed by Ruiz-Noguez in his commentary on the ICV chart.

According to Ramos Perera, hypothesis #3 was the case of the first "wall face" appearance of Bélmez: the ghastly face known as ''La Pava''. Presently this old face is fading out in the dark, humid cement as can be seen in the photographs of a website. Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written that the Bélmez Faces were deliberately faked, and the faces looked very amateurish in design.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1993"/&gt;

Brian Dunning of ''[[Brian Dunning (author)#Skeptoid podcast|Skeptoid]]'' has written that "the faces were shown to have been painted on the concrete floor, the first with paint and later with acid, and the woman living in the house found to be perpetrating a hoax on the public for financial gain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4193|number=193|title= The Faces of Belmez|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "new" Bélmez faces==
María Gómez, the purported psychic that allegedly produced the appearances, died in February 2004 at the age of 85 years. After her death the popular psychic researcher Pedro Amorós tried to "discover" more thoughtographic appearances in María's house. A new wave of Bélmez faces thus took place.  However, Amorós' claims have been debunked in the Spanish media. In November 2004 the newspaper ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] '' published the article "New Belmez Faces Faked by 'Ghostbusters' and Municipal Government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/11/28/sociedad/1101615058.html Las nuevas caras de Bélmez fueron falsificadas por unos 'cazafantasmas' en complicidad con el ayuntamiento]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2007, journalist Javier Cavanilles and investigator Francisco Máñez published a book called ''Los Caras de Bélmez'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Los Caras de Bélmez (Valencia, Spain:  Redactors i Editors – RIE)| year = 2007| last = Javier Cavanilles | first = Francisco Máñez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.es/Los-Caras-B%C3%A9lmez-misterio-paranormal-ebook/dp/B00MC3RZTC Los caras de Bélmez – Spanish Kindle edition]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a double entendre meaning "The Faces of Bélmez" and "The Scoundrels of Bélmez",&lt;ref&gt;The authors play tongue-in-cheek here with "cara" (feminine) as in "face", and "cara" (masculine) as in "scoundrel, snake-oil salesman, sassy person".&lt;/ref&gt; where they explain the history of the scam and pointed to María's son, Diego Pereira, as author of the mysterious paintings.

'''''Cabeza de Vaca''''' is a 1991 Mexican film about the adventures of [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] (c. 1490 – c. 1557), an early Spanish explorer, as he traversed what later became the American Southeast. He was one of four survivors of the [[Narvaez expedition]] and shipwreck. He became known as a [[shaman]] among the Native American tribes he encountered, which helped him survive.  His journey of a number of years began in 1528. After his return to Spain, he published his journal in 1542. The screenplay by [[Guillermo Sheridan]] and Nicolás Echevarría is based on this journal.

Directed by [[Nicolás Echevarría]] and starring [[Juan Diego (actor)|Juan Diego]], the film 
was entered into the [[41st Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1991/02_programm_1991/02_Programm_1991.html |title=Berlinale: 1991 Programme |accessdate=2011-03-21 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was selected as the Mexican entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[63rd Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

A DVD version was released in 2012.

'''Castleton Garland Day''' or '''Garland King Day''' is held annually on 29 May (unless that date falls on a Sunday, when the custom is transferred to the Saturday) in the town of [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] in the [[Derbyshire]] [[Peak District]]. The Garland King, on horseback, and covered to the waist in a heavy, bell-shaped floral [[garland]], leads a procession through the town.&lt;ref name=Derbyshireuknet&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.derbyshireuk.net/dcustom2.html|work=Derbyshire UK|title=Derbyshire and Peak District Customs:Castleton Garland Day|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124064820/http://derbyshireuk.net/dcustom2.html|year=2001|archivedate=24 November 2010|via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The date of the custom coincides with [[Oak Apple Day]] and it is said to commemorate the [[Restoration (England)|restoration of King Charles II]] in 1660. By the 1960s, it had become [[Conventional wisdom|received wisdom]] that the celebration was a remnant of a more ancient form of [[nature worship]], and in 1977 one folklorist—whom Georgina Boyes describes as "a Celticist with a vivid line in descriptive prose..."—declared it to be based on a much older rite of human sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Hole&gt;{{Citation|last=Hole|first=Christina|year=1978|title=A Dictionary of British Folk Customs|pages=114–115|publisher=Paladin Granada|isbn=0-586-08293-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyes"&gt;{{Citation|first=Georgina|last=Boyes|title=Cultural Survivals Theory and Traditional Customs|journal=Folk Life|volume=26|year=1988|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/043087787798239486|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this was reported in the national media, it attracted the attention of sceptical academics.&lt;ref name=Boyes/&gt; 

Boyes' subsequent extensive research of local records demonstrated that the "ancient" custom was no older than the late 18th—early 19th century, and had grown out of the village's ecclesiastical [[rushbearing]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspects of British Calendar Customs|year=1993|editor-first1=Theresa|editor-last1=Buckland|editor-first2=Juliette|editor-last2=Wood|first=Georgina|last=Boyes|pages=105-118|chapter=Dressing in the past: The role  of costume as an indicator of social dynamics in the Castleton garland ceremony|isbn=1850752435|location=Sheffield|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bellringers of the festival had first been replaced in 1897 by [[morris men]], and then—as the day increasingly became a tourist attraction—by "schoolgirls in white" and participants "in historical costumes" to "prettify" the event.&lt;ref name=Simpson/&gt; The Maypole was first used in the festival in 1916.&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{Citation|title=A Dictionary of English Folklore|year=2000|first1=Jacqueline|last1=Simpson|first2=Stephen|last2=Roud|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-192-10019-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "acceptable piece of 'folk' pageantry" became the new custom, and remained so throughout the 20th and 21st century, with the only change being the use of a female to play the Lady, instead of a male in "[[Drag (clothing)|drag]]", from the late 1950s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Ronald|last=Hutton|authorlink=Ronald Hutton|title=The Stations of The Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain|year=1996|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|edition=2001|pages=293-4|isbn=978-0-192-85448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The custom==
Starting from midday, most of the afternoon is taken up with the construction of the Garland, a roughly bell- or beehive-shaped wooden framework to which are tied bunches of garden flowers. Once it is finished, a small [[Nosegay|posy]] named "The Queen", made of particularly fine flowers tied around a short stick, is inserted as a topknot into the top of the garland.&lt;ref name=Hole/&gt;

In the late afternoon the Garland King and his female consort (confusingly, sometimes mistakenly referred to as "The Queen", but formerly simply "The Lady"), dressed in [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] costume, mount their horses. The Garland, which is said to weigh between {{convert|56|and|60|lb|kg|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=Derbyshireuknet/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hole/&gt; is placed over the King's head and shoulders; only his legs are visible beneath it. The dance starts at one of the village's pubs (the starting point is chosen on rotation). The riders and Castleton [[brass band|Silver Band]] then lead an evening procession around the town, stopping at various points, including all the [[public house|pubs]]. Young schoolgirls dressed in white, with flowers, carrying small "maypoles" (known as "Garland sticks") twined with ribbons, follow behind; they dance a form of [[morris dance]] at each stopping-place.&lt;ref name=Hole/&gt;

When the circuit of the village is complete, the King rides up to the churchyard gates, where the Queen (posy) is removed from the top of the Garland. It is kept on one side to be placed on the village's [[war memorial]]. The King rides to the foot of the tower of St Edmund's church where all the [[pinnacle]]s but one have been decorated with oak leaf branches. A long rope is hung down and tied to the Garland, which is hoisted up the side of the tower and then impaled on the central pinnacle. It remains there for several days until the flowers have wilted. Formerly it was left to fall apart completely.&lt;ref name=Hole/&gt;

The day concludes with [[maypole]] dancing in the Market Place and the ceremonial placing of the Queen posy on the war memorial. Then the residents of the village follow the band back through the village dancing the "Criss-Cross."

'''Charles Eaton''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (21&amp;nbsp;December 1895&amp;nbsp;– 12&amp;nbsp;November 1979) was a senior officer and aviator in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), who later served as a diplomat. Born in [[London]], he joined the [[British Army]] upon the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;I and saw action on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] before transferring to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in 1917. Posted as a bomber pilot to [[No. 206 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;206 Squadron]], he was twice captured by German forces, and twice escaped. Eaton left the military in 1920 and worked in India until moving to Australia in 1923. Two years later he joined the RAAF, serving initially as an [[Flight instructor|instructor]] at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]]. Between 1929 and 1931, he was chosen to lead three expeditions to search for lost aircraft in [[Central Australia]], gaining national attention and earning the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] for his "zeal and devotion to duty".

In 1939, on the eve of World War II, Eaton became the inaugural commanding officer of [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;12 (General Purpose) Squadron]] at the newly established [[RAAF Base Darwin|RAAF Station Darwin]] in Northern Australia. Promoted [[group captain]] the following year, he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1942. He took command of [[No. 79 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing]] at [[Batchelor, Northern Territory|Batchelor]], Northern Territory, in 1943, and was [[mentioned in despatches]] during operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]]. Retiring from the RAAF in December 1945, Eaton took up diplomatic posts in the [[Dutch East Indies]], heading a [[United Nations]] commission as [[Consul (representative)|Consul-General]] during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]]. He returned to Australia in 1950, and served in [[Canberra]] for a further two years. Popularly known as "Moth" Eaton, he was a farmer in later life, and died in 1979 at the age of 83. He is commemorated by several memorials in the Northern Territory.

Charles Eaton was born on 21&amp;nbsp;December 1895 in [[Lambeth]], London, the son of William Walpole Eaton, a butcher, and his wife Grace. Schooled in [[Wandsworth]], Charles worked in [[Battersea|Battersea Town Council]] from the age of fourteen, before joining the [[London Regiment]] upon the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;I in August 1914.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140082b.htm?hilite=eaton|title=Eaton, Charles (1895–1979)|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cross and Cockade"&gt;{{cite magazine | year = 2002| author= Williamson, Mitch|title = 'Moth' Eaton: From Trench to Sky|magazine= Cross and Cockade| volume = 33|pages=104–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to a bicycle company in the 24th Battalion of the [[47th (1/2nd London) Division|47th Division]], he arrived at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in March 1915. He took part in [[Trench warfare|trench bombing]] missions and attacks on enemy lines of communication, seeing action in the [[Second Battle of Artois|Battles of Aubers Ridge]], [[Battle of Festubert|Festubert]], [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], and [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]].&lt;ref name="Cross and Cockade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Air Force News"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kelton, Group Captain Mark| title=Remembered: Darwin's man of action| url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4804/history/story01.htm| journal=Air Force News| date=23 March 2006| accessdate=2 January 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304133744/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4804/history/story01.htm| archivedate=4 March 2016| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14&amp;nbsp;May 1915, Eaton transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC), undergoing initial pilot training at [[Oxford]]. While he was landing his [[Farman MF.11|Maurice Farman Shorthorn]] at the end of his first solo flight, another student collided with him and was killed, but Eaton emerged uninjured.&lt;ref name="Cross and Cockade"/&gt; He was commissioned in August and was awarded his [[Flying badge|wings]] in October. Ranked [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]], he served with [[No. 110 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;110 Squadron]], which operated [[Martinsyde G.100|Martinsyde G.100 "Elephant"]] fighters out of [[Sedgeford]], defending London against [[Zeppelin]] airships.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/P03531.004|title= P03531.004|publisher= [[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate= 2 January 2016|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120813162427/http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/P03531.004|archivedate= 13 August 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transferred to the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in April 1918, he was posted the following month to France flying [[Airco DH.9]] single-engined bombers with [[No. 206 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;206 Squadron]].&lt;ref name="Cross and Cockade"/&gt; On 29&amp;nbsp;June, he was shot down behind enemy lines and captured in the vicinity of [[Nieppe]]. Incarcerated in [[Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp]], Germany, Eaton escaped but was recaptured and [[court-martial]]led, after which he was kept in solitary confinement. He later effected another escape and succeeded in rejoining his squadron in the final days of the war.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grose"&gt;Grose, ''An Awkward Truth'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==
[[File:Eaton1929.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Flight Lieutenant Eaton, "'Knight Errant' of the desert skies", 1929|alt=Half portrait of young grinning man in flying suit]]
Eaton remained in the RAF following the cessation of hostilities. He married Beatrice Godfrey in St. Thomas's church at [[Shepherd's Bush]], London, on 11&amp;nbsp;January 1919. Posted to [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]], he was a pilot on the first regular passenger service between London and Paris, ferrying delegates to and from the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grose"/&gt; Eaton was sent to India in December to undertake aerial survey work, including the first such survey of the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farram"&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the RAF in July 1920, remaining in India to take up employment with the Imperial Forest Service. After successfully applying for a position with the [[Queensland]] Forestry Service, he and his family migrated to Australia in 1923.&lt;ref name="Farram"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Who's Who in Australia 1950'', p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]], Victoria, he enlisted as a [[flying officer]] in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) at [[Laverton, Victoria|Laverton]] on 14&amp;nbsp;August 1925.&lt;ref name="WW2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1046384 |title=Eaton, Charles|work= World War 2 Nominal Roll|accessdate= 2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posted to [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Point Cook]], as a flight instructor, where he became known as a strict disciplinarian who "trained his pilots well".&lt;ref name="Grose"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farram"/&gt; Here Eaton acquired his nickname of "Moth", the Air Force's basic trainer at this time being the [[De Havilland DH.60 Moth]]. Promoted [[flight lieutenant]] in February 1928,&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; he flew a Moth in the [[Western Australian Centenary Air Race|1929 East-West Air Race]] from Sydney to Perth, as part of the celebrations for the [[Centenary of Western Australia|Western Australia Centenary]]; he was the sixth competitor across the line, after fellow RFC veteran [[Jerry Pentland]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&amp;inttype=1&amp;intid=621 |title=East-West Air Race Ends |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=7 October 1929 |accessdate=2 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915114612/http://www.150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&amp;inttype=1&amp;intid=621 |archivedate=15 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded as one of the RAAF's most skilful cross-country pilots and navigators, Eaton came to public attention as leader of three military expeditions to find lost aircraft in [[Central Australia]] between 1929 and 1931.&lt;ref name="Third Brother pp.297-303"&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 297–303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lax"&gt;Lax, ''100 Years of Aviation'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1929, he coordinated the Air Force's part in the search for aviators Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, missing in their aircraft the ''[[Kookaburra (aircraft)|Kookaburra]]'' while themselves looking for [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and [[Charles Ulm]], who had force landed the ''[[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]]'' in north [[Western Australia]] during a flight from Sydney. Three of the RAAF's five "ancient" DH.9 biplanes went down in the search—though all crews escaped injury—including Eaton's, which experienced what he labelled "a good crash" on 21&amp;nbsp;April near [[Tennant Creek]] after the engine's pistons melted.&lt;ref name="Lax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farram pp.4-12"&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', pp. 4–12&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Captain [[Lester Brain]], flying a [[Qantas]] aircraft, located the wreck of the ''Kookaburra'' in the [[Tanami Desert]], approximately {{convert|130|km|mi}} east-south-east of [[Kalkarindji, Northern Territory|Wave Hill]]. Setting out from Wave Hill on 23&amp;nbsp;April, Eaton led a ground party across rough terrain that reached the crash site four days later and buried the crew, who had perished of thirst and exposure. Not a particularly religious man, he recalled that after the burial he saw a perfect cross formed by [[cirrus cloud]] in an otherwise clear blue sky above the ''Kookaburra''.&lt;ref name="Third Brother pp.297-303"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farram pp.4-12"/&gt; The [[Air Board (Australia)|Air Board]] described the RAAF's search as taking 240 hours flying time "under the most trying conditions&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;where a forced landing meant certain crash".&lt;ref name="Third Brother pp.297-303"/&gt; In November 1930, Eaton was selected to lead another expedition for a missing aircraft near [[Uluru|Ayers Rock]], but it was called off soon afterwards when the pilot showed up in [[Alice Springs]]. The next month, he was ordered to search for W.L. Pittendrigh and S.J. Hamre, who had disappeared in the biplane ''Golden Quest&amp;nbsp;2'' while attempting to discover [[Lasseter's Reef]]. Employing a total of four DH.60 Moths, the RAAF team located the missing men near Dashwood Creek on 7&amp;nbsp;January 1931, and they were rescued four days later by a ground party accompanied by Eaton. Staying in nearby Alice Springs, he recommended a site for the town's new airfield, which was approved and has remained in use since its construction.&lt;ref name="Lax"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', pp. 13–17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PH0612-0004Eaton1929.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Eaton (right) and Sergeant Eric Douglas at Keith Anderson's grave, near the wreck of the ''Kookaburra'', Central Australia, April 1929|alt=Blurry image of two men standing by tree stump with wreath]]
Eaton was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] on 10&amp;nbsp;March 1931 "in recognition of his zeal and devotion to duty in conducting flights to Central Australia in search of missing aviators".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33697|page=1648|date=10 March 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media called him the "'[[Knight-errant|Knight Errant]]' of the desert skies".&lt;ref name="Lax"/&gt; Aside from his crash landing in the desert while searching for the ''Kookaburra'', Eaton had another narrow escape in 1929 when he was test flying the [[Wackett Warrigal|Wackett Warrigal&amp;nbsp;I]] with [[Sergeant]] Eric Douglas. Having purposely put the biplane trainer into a spin and finding no response in the controls when he tried to recover, Eaton called on Douglas to bail out. When Douglas stood up to do so, the spin stopped, apparently due to his torso changing the airflow over the tail plane. Eaton then managed to land the aeroplane, he and his passenger both badly shaken by the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1931, he was posted to [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot]] at Laverton, where he continued to fly as well as performing administrative work. Promoted [[squadron leader]] in 1936,&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; he undertook a clandestine mission around the new year to scout for suitable landing grounds in the [[Dutch East Indies]], primarily [[Timor]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]]. Wearing civilian clothes, he and his companion were arrested and held for three days by local authorities in [[Kupang|Koepang]], Dutch Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton was appointed commanding officer (CO) of [[No. 21 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;21 Squadron]] in May 1937, one of his first tasks being to undertake another aerial search in Central Australia, this time for prospector Sir Herbert Gepp, who was subsequently discovered alive and well.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lax"/&gt; Later that year, Eaton presided over the court of inquiry into the crash of a [[Hawker Demon]] biplane in Victoria, recommending a gallantry award for Aircraftman [[William McAloney]], who had leapt into the Demon's burning wreckage in an effort to rescue its pilot; McAloney subsequently received the [[Albert Medal (lifesaving)|Albert Medal]] for his heroism.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 342–344&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 1937 decision to establish the first [[Northern Australia|north Australian]] RAAF base, in April 1938 Eaton, now on the headquarters staff of [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]], and Wing Commander [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], Director of Personnel Services at RAAF Headquarters, began developing plans for the new station, to be commanded by Jones, and a new squadron that would be based there, led by Eaton. The next month they flew an [[Avro Anson]] on an inspection tour of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory, site of the proposed base. Delays meant that [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;12 (General Purpose) Squadron]] was not formed until 6&amp;nbsp;February 1939 at Laverton. Jones had by now moved on to another posting but Eaton took up the squadron's command as planned. Promoted to [[wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1&amp;nbsp;March, he and his equipment officer, Flying Officer Hocking, were ordered to build up the unit as quickly as possible, and established an initial complement of fourteen officers and 120 airmen, plus four Ansons and four Demons, within a week. An advance party of thirty [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and airmen under Hocking began moving to Darwin on 1&amp;nbsp;July. Staff were initially accommodated in a former meatworks built during World War&amp;nbsp;I, and life at the newly established air base had a "distinctly raw, pioneering feel about it" according to historian Chris Coulthard-Clark. Morale, though, was high.&lt;ref name="Third Brother pp.145-148"&gt;Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 145–148&lt;/ref&gt; On 31&amp;nbsp;August, No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron launched its first patrol over the Darwin area, flown by one of seven Ansons that had so far been delivered. These were augmented by a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of four [[CAC Wirraway]]s (replacing the originally planned force of Demons) that took off from Laverton on 2&amp;nbsp;September, the day before [[Military history of Australia during World War II|Australia declared war]], and arrived in Darwin four days later. A fifth Wirraway in the flight crashed on landing at Darwin, killing both crewmen.&lt;ref name="Third Brother pp.145-148"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:PH0612-0002Eaton1940.jpg|thumb|upright|Wing Commander Eaton (left) during Darwin's coal strike, 1940|alt=Two men stripped to waist and covered in coal dust, one smoking a pipe]]
Once war was declared, Darwin began to receive more attention from military planners. In June 1940, No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron was "cannibalised" to form two additional units, [[RAAF Base Darwin|Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin]] and [[No. 13 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;13 Squadron]]. No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron retained its Wirraway flight, while its two flights of Ansons went to the new squadron; these were replaced later that month by more capable [[Lockheed Hudson]]s.&lt;ref name="Gillison"&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/06.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939–1942'', pp. 125–126] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713132732/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/06.pdf |date=13 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eaton was appointed CO of the base, gaining promotion to temporary [[group captain]] in September.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; His squadrons were employed in escort, maritime reconnaissance, and coastal patrol duties, the overworked aircraft having to be sent to [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, after every 240 hours flying time—with a consequent three-week loss from Darwin's strength—as deep maintenance was not yet possible in the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name="Gillison"/&gt; Soon after the establishment of Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin, Minister for Air [[James Fairbairn]] visited the base. Piloting his own light plane, he was greeted by four Wirraways that proceeded to escort him into landing; the Minister subsequently complimented Eaton on the "keen-ness and efficiency of all ranks", particularly considering the challenging environment.&lt;ref&gt;RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; When Fairbairn died in the [[1940 Canberra air disaster|Canberra air disaster]] shortly afterwards, his pilot was Flight Lieutenant Robert Hitchcock, son of Bob Hitchcock of the ''Kookaburra'' and also a former member of Eaton's No.&amp;nbsp;21 Squadron.&lt;ref name="Farram, p. 27"&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;

As senior air commander in the region, Eaton sat on the Darwin Defence Co-ordination Committee. He was occasionally at loggerheads with his naval counterpart, [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] E.P. Thomas, and also incurred the ire of trade unionists when he used RAAF staff to unload ships in [[Port Darwin]] during industrial action; Eaton himself took part in the work, shovelling coal alongside his men.&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; On 25&amp;nbsp;February 1941, he made a flight north to reconnoitre Timor, Ambon, and Babo in [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]] for potential use by the RAAF in any Pacific conflict.&lt;ref name="Farram, p. 27"/&gt; By April, the total strength based at RAAF Station Darwin had increased to almost 700 officers and airmen; by the following month it had been augmented by satellite airfields at [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]], [[Groote Eylandt]], [[Batchelor, Northern Territory|Batchelor]], and [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]].&lt;ref name="Gillison"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Handing over command of Darwin to Group Captain [[Frederick Scherger]] in October, Eaton took charge of [[No. 2 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Service Flying Training School]] near [[Wagga Wagga]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; His "marked success", "untiring energy", and "tact in handling men" while in the Northern Territory were recognised in the new year with his appointment as an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35399 |supp=y|page=13|date=1 January 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton became CO of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Engineering School and its base, [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|RAAF Station Ascot Vale]], Victoria, in April 1942.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillison"/&gt; Twelve months later in [[Townsville]], Queensland, he formed [[No. 72 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;72 Wing]], which subsequently deployed to [[Merauke]] in Dutch New Guinea, comprising [[No. 84 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp; 84 Squadron]] (flying [[CAC Boomerang]] fighters), [[No. 86 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp; 86 Squadron]] ([[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Kittyhawk]] fighters), and [[No. 12 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;12 Squadron]] ([[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|A-31 Vengeance]] dive bombers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 114–115] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164944/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/07.pdf |date=27 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His relations with [[North-Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|North-Eastern Area Command]] in Townsville were strained; "mountains were made out of molehills" in his opinion, and he was reassigned that July to lead No.&amp;nbsp;2 Bombing and Gunnery School in [[Port Pirie]], South Australia.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

[[File:Eaton1941.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Group Captain Eaton, commanding officer of RAAF Station Darwin, October 1941|alt=Informal portrait of man with short dark hair in light-coloured open-necked military shirt, holding a pipe]]
On 30&amp;nbsp;November 1943, Eaton returned to the Northern Territory to establish [[No. 79 Wing RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing]] at Batchelor, comprising [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1]] and [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Squadrons]] (flying [[Bristol Beaufort]] light reconnaissance bombers), [[No. 31 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;31 Squadron]] ([[Bristol Beaufighter]] long-range fighters), and [[No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;18 (Netherlands East Indies)
Squadron]] ([[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] medium bombers). He developed a good relationship with his Dutch personnel, who called him "Oom Charles" (Uncle Charles).&lt;ref&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Odgers"&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/13.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 215–218]&lt;/ref&gt; Operating under the auspices of [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area Command]] (NWA), Darwin, Eaton's forces participated in the [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and [[North-Western Area Campaign]]s during 1944, in which he regularly flew on missions himself.&lt;ref name="Odgers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farram pp.48-49"&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; Through March–April, his Beaufighters attacked enemy shipping, while the Mitchells and Beauforts bombed Timor on a daily basis as a prelude to [[Operations Reckless and Persecution]], the invasions of [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] and [[Aitape]]. On 19&amp;nbsp;April, he organised a large raid against [[South Central Timor Regency|Su]], Dutch Timor, employing thirty-five Mitchells, Beauforts and Beaufighters to destroy the town's barracks and fuel dumps, the results earning him the personal congratulations of the [[Air Officer Commanding]] NWA, Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|"King" Cole]], for his "splendid effort".&lt;ref name="Odgers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farram pp.48-49"/&gt; On the day of the Allied landings, 22&amp;nbsp;April, the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a daylight raid on [[Dili]], Portuguese Timor. The ground assault met little opposition, credited in part to the air bombardment in the days leading up to it.&lt;ref name="Odgers"/&gt; In June–July, No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing supported the [[Battle of Noemfoor|Allied attack on Noemfoor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/15.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 243–244]&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton was recommended to be [[mentioned in despatches]] on 28&amp;nbsp;October 1944 for his "Gallant and distinguished service" in NWA; this was promulgated in the ''London Gazette'' on 9&amp;nbsp;March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110022.pdf Recommendation: Mention in Dispatches] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305134713/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00311/003110022.pdf |date=5 March 2016 }} at Australian War Memorial.

Completing his tour with No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing, Eaton was appointed Air Officer Commanding [[Southern Area Command (RAAF)|Southern Area]], Melbourne, in January 1945. The {{GS|U-862}} operated off southern Australia during the first months of 1945, and the few combat units in Eaton's command were heavily engaged in [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine patrols]] which sought to locate this and any other [[U-boat]]s in the area. The Air Officer Commanding [[RAAF Command]], Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], considered the sporadic attacks to be partly "nuisance value", designed to draw Allied resources away from the front line of the South West Pacific war. In April, Eaton complained to Bostock that intelligence from [[British Pacific Fleet]] concerning its ships' movements eastwards out of [[Western Area Command (RAAF)|Western Area]] was hours out of date by the time it was received at Southern Area Command, leading to RAAF aircraft missing their rendezvous and wasting valuable flying hours searching empty ocean. There had been no U-boat strikes since February, and by June the naval authorities indicated that there was no pressing need for air cover except for the most important vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/21.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 351–354] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402164044/https://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/21.pdf |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career and legacy==
[[File:P03531.001EatonSukarno1947.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Eaton as Australian Consul-General to Indonesia, with [[Sukarno]] in 1947|alt=Two men in light-coloured clothing, seated on a couch]]
Eaton retired from the RAAF on 31&amp;nbsp;December 1945.&lt;ref name="WW2"/&gt; In recognition of his war service, he was appointed a [[Order of Orange-Nassau|Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau with Swords]] by the Dutch government on 17&amp;nbsp;January 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1532083/?query=&amp;section%5B0%5D=people&amp;op=Search&amp;filter%5Brcdb_id%5D=360933&amp;format=tile |title=Award: Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau&amp;nbsp;– Commander|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, he became Australian [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Dili. He had seen an advertisement for the position and was the only applicant with experience of the area. While based there, he accompanied the provincial governor on visits to townships damaged in Allied raids during the war, taking care to be circumspect about the part played by his own forces from No.&amp;nbsp;79 Wing.&lt;ref name="Farram pp.52-53"&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1947, Dutch forces launched a "[[Operation Product|police action]]" against territory held by the fledgling [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian Republic]], which had been declared shortly after the end of the war. Following a ceasefire, the [[United Nations]] set up a commission, chaired by Eaton as Consul-General, to monitor progress. Eaton and his fellow commissioners believed that the ceasefire was serving the Dutch as a cover for further penetration of republican enclaves. His requests to the Australian government for military observers led to deployment of the first peacekeeping force to the region; the Australians were soon followed by British and US observers, and enabled Eaton to display a more realistic impression of the situation to the outside world. The Dutch administration strongly opposed the presence of UN forces and accused Eaton of "impropriety", but the Australian government refused to recall him.&lt;ref name="Air Power"&gt;RAAF, ''The Australian Experience of Air Power'', pp.142–143&lt;/ref&gt; Following the transfer of sovereignty in December 1949, he became Australia's first secretary and [[chargé d'affaires]] to the [[United States of Indonesia|Republic of the United States of Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Farram pp.52-53"/&gt; In 1950, he returned to Australia to serve with the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of External Affairs]] in Canberra.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; After retiring from public service in 1951, he and his wife farmed at [[Metung]], Victoria, and cultivated [[orchid]]s.&lt;ref name="Farram pp.52-53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farram pp.54-55"&gt;Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; They later moved to [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], where Eaton was involved in promotional work.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

Charles Eaton died in Frankston on 12&amp;nbsp;November 1979. Survived by his wife and two sons, he was cremated. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were scattered near Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the ''Kookaburra'', from an RAAF [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|Caribou]] on 15&amp;nbsp;April 1981.&lt;ref name="Air Force News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farram pp.54-55"/&gt; His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory, commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of [[Karama, Northern Territory|Karama]], Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to [[Darwin International Airport]], and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel. He is also honoured with a display at the [[Northern Territory Parliament]], and a [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] memorial at [[Tennant Creek Airport]].&lt;ref name="Farram"/&gt; At the RAAF's 2003 History Conference, [[Air Commodore]] Mark Lax, recalling Eaton's search-and-rescue missions between the wars, commented: "Today, we might think of Eaton perhaps as the pioneer of our contribution to assistance to the civil community—a tradition that continues today. Perhaps I might jog your memory to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned—the amazing location of missing yachtsmen Thierry Dubois, [[Isabelle Autissier]] and [[Tony Bullimore]] by our [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3s]] that guided the [[Royal Australian Navy|Navy]] to their eventual rescue. My observation is that such activities remain vital for our relevance in that we must remain connected, supportive and responsive to the wants and needs of the Australian community."&lt;ref name="Lax"/&gt;

'''The International Music Festival ‘Chopin and his Europe’''' – an international music festival organised in Warsaw since 2005 by the [[Fryderyk Chopin Institute]], presenting European music within the context of its links with the life and work of the Polish pianist, composer and teacher [[Frédéric Chopin|Fryderyk Chopin]] (1810–1849). The project is realised as part of the government programme ‘Fryderyk Chopin Heritage 2010’.

It is one of the annual cultural events of the summer in [[Poland]], devised by artistic director Stanisław Leszczyński.

One important strand to the festival programme is historical performance – presenting works as they were originally heard, on period pianos in the possession of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute: an Erard from 1849, a Pleyel from 1846 and a Graf (a copy of an instrument from c. 1819).

The festival is organised in collaboration with the [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra|Warsaw Philharmonic]], Teatr Wielki – [[Grand Theatre, Warsaw|Polish National Opera]] and [[Polskie Radio|Polish Radio]] II.

Each year, the invited guests include performers from around the world, many of whom have a special connection with the festival, including [[Martha Argerich|Marta Argerich]], [[Nelson Goerner]], [[Dina Joffe|Dina Yoffe]], [[Tobias Koch]], [[Ivo Pogorelić|Ivo Pogorelich]], [[Garrick Ohlsson]] and [[Jan Lisiecki]]. The festival also features performances by finalists and other participants in the [[International Chopin Piano Competition|Chopin Competition]].

A '''chronicle''' ({{lang-la|chronica}}, from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χρονικά}} ''chroniká'', from {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, ''chrónos'' – "time") is a historical account of facts and events arranged in [[chronology|chronological]] order, as in a [[time line]]. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important.

Chronicler information sources vary; some chronicles are written from first-hand knowledge, some are from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed mouth to mouth prior to being written down.&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"&gt;Elisabeth M. C. Van Houts, Memory and Gender in Medieval Europe: 900–1200 (Toronto ; Buffalo : University of Toronto Press, 1999), pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Some used written material: Charters, letters, or the works of earlier chroniclers.&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"/&gt; Still others are tales of such unknown origins so as to hold mythical status.&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"/&gt; Copyists also affected chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original author(s).&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"/&gt;  The reliability of a particular chronicle is an important determination for modern historians.&lt;ref name="MGME19-20"/&gt;

In modern times various contemporary newspapers or other periodicals have adopted "chronicle" as part of their name. Various fictional stories have also adopted "chronicle" as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories. A chronicle which traces world history is called a [[universal chronicle]].

==Subgroups==
Scholars categorize the genre of chronicle into two subgroups: live chronicles, and dead chronicles. A ''dead'' chronicle is one where the author gathers his list of events up to the time of his writing, but does not record further events as they occur. A ''live'' chronicle is where one or more authors add to a chronicle in a regular fashion, recording contemporary events shortly after they occur. Because of the immediacy of the information, historians tend to value live chronicles, such as [[annals]], over dead ones.

The term often refers to a book written by a chronicler in the Middle Ages describing historical events in a country, or the lives of a nobleman or a clergyman, although it is also applied to a record of public events. The earliest medieval chronicle to combine both retrospective (''dead'') and contemporary (''live'') entries, is the [[Chronicle of Ireland]], which spans the years 431 to 911.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Flechner, '"The Chronicle of Ireland: Then and Now" ''Early Medieval Europe'' v.21:4(2013)422-54  [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/emed.12025/abstract Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronicles are the predecessors of modern "[[time line]]s" rather than analytical histories. They represent accounts, in prose or verse, of local or distant events over a considerable period of time, both the lifetime of the individual chronicler and often those of several subsequent [[continuator]]s. If the chronicles deal with events year by year, they are often called [[annal]]s. Unlike the modern historian, most chroniclers tended to take their information as they found it, and made little attempt to separate fact from legend. The point of view of most chroniclers is highly localised, to the extent that many anonymous chroniclers can be sited in individual [[abbey]]s.

It is impossible to say how many chronicles exist, as the many ambiguities in the definition of the genre make it impossible to draw clear distinctions of what should or should not be included. However, the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle]]'' lists some 2,500 items written between 300 and 1500 AD.

==English chronicles==
The most important [[List of English chronicles|English chronicles]] are the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', started under the patronage of King Alfred in the 9th century and continued until the 12th century, and the ''Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland'' (1577–87) by [[Raphael Holinshed]] and other writers; the latter documents were important sources of materials for Elizabethan drama.&lt;ref&gt;'A Glossary of Literary Terms' – M.H. Abrams&lt;/ref&gt; Later 16th century Scottish chronicles, written after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], shape history according to Catholic or Protestant viewpoints.

'''CRUNCH''' was a former Saturday morning programming block dedicated to [[animation]] on the Canadian television channel [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]]. CRUNCH premiered on September 9, 2006, replacing [[The Zone Summer Weekends]] hosted by Sugar and Carlos, and "Vortex" hosted by Paula. From its beginning until mid September 2008, it was hosted by [[Ajay Fry]]. Starting October 4, 2008, Andy Chapman (not to be confused with Andy from the YTV show, [[Prank Patrol (Canadian TV series)|Prank Patrol]]) became the host.

The theme of the new [[Block programming|programming block]] was a new holiday called "day 6", where there is no homework, chores or hobbies, such as music classes which could interrupt a kid's day during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (the hours that the CRUNCH programming block aired). YTV promoted the new programming block by inviting kids to download a kit which included door hangers informing others that day 6 was on and no chores and homework were being completed. There were also flyers which contained many of the programming block's slogans and a large notebook poster.

The hosted portions of CRUNCH were different than other programming blocks. Rather than having a host talk for 5 minutes after a show, it was divided into two parts: one during the second commercial break, and one during the credits. Crunch also used special [[Digital on-screen graphic|on-screen bugs]]. Sister block [[The Zone (YTV)|The Zone]] followed its footsteps on September 3, 2007.

The block ended on September 28, 2013 as it became its very own channel.

{{Population transfer}}
'''The deportation of the Crimean Tatars''' ([[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] ''Qırımtatar sürgünligi''; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ''Депортація кримських татар''; [[Russian language|Russian]] ''Депортация крымских татар'') was the [[ethnic cleansing]] of at least 191,044 [[Crimean Tatars|Tatars]] from [[Crimea]] in 18-20 May 1944. It was carried out by [[Lavrentiy Beria]], head of the Soviet [[state security]] and [[secret police]], acting on behalf of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Within three days, Beria's [[NKVD]] used cattle trains to deport women, children, the elderly, even [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communists]] and members of the [[Red Army]], to the Soviet Republic of [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]], several thousand kilometres away. They were one of the ten [[ethnicities]] who were encompassed by Stalin's policy of [[population transfer in the Soviet Union]].

The deportation ostensibly was intended as collective punishment for the perceived collaboration of some Crimean Tatars with [[Nazi Germany]]. Soviet sources indict the Tatars as traitors; Tatar nationalists dispute this, maintaining the program was part of the Soviet [[Turkish Straits crisis|plan to gain access]] to the [[Dardanelles]] and acquire territory in [[Turkey]] where the Tatars had ethnic kinsmen. Although the Nazis initially viewed the Crimean Tatars negatively, their policy changed in face of determined Soviet resistance. Many of the [[Soviet prisoners of war (Nazi Germany)|Soviet prisoners of war]] were recruited by the [[Wehrmacht]] as support units. Meanwhile, 15,000 to 20,000 Crimean Tatars were persuaded to form [[Selbstschutz|self-defence battalions]] to protect Crimean Tatar villages from attacks by [[Soviet partisans]] as well as hunting them down, though these units typically sided with whoever was stronger in an area. In addition, Muslim Committees were also formed, giving them limited self-governance. This increased the suspicion despite a similar number as the self-defence volunteers also having joined the Red Army and thousands still serving when the Soviets [[Battle of Berlin|attacked Berlin]], with numerous Crimean Tatars also joining the partisans. Majority of [[hiwis]] and their families, along with those associated with Muslim Committees eventually were evacuated. Although many Soviet officials recognised that the guilty segments of the population had been evacuated, the demand to collectively punish the Crimean Tatars grew louder.

Nearly 8,000 Crimean Tatars died during the deportation, while tens of thousands perished subsequently due to the harsh exile conditions. The Tatar exile resulted in the abandonment of 80,000 households and 360,000 acres of land. Stalin sought to eradicate all traces of the Crimean Tatars and, in subsequent [[census]]es, forbade any mention of the ethnic group. In 1956, the new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned Stalin's policies, including the deportation of various ethnicities, but did not lift the directive forbidding the return of the Crimean Tatars. They remained in [[Central Asia]] for several more decades until the [[Perestroika]] era in the late 1980s when 260,000 Tatars returned to Crimea. Their exile lasted 45 years. The ban on their return was officially declared null and void, and the [[Supreme Council of Crimea]] declared on 14 November 1989 that the deportations had been a crime.

By 2004, sufficient numbers of Tatars had returned to Crimea that they comprised 12 percent of the peninsula's population. The local authorities did not assist their return or compensate them for the land they lost. The [[Russian Federation]], the [[successor state]] of the USSR, did not provide [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]], compensate those deported for lost property, or file legal proceedings against the perpetrators of the forced resettlement. The deportation was a crucial event in the history of the Crimean Tatars, and has come to be seen as a symbol of the plight and oppression of smaller ethnic groups by the Soviet Union. On 12 December 2015, the [[Ukrainian Parliament]] issued a resolution recognizing this event as [[genocide]] and established 18 May as the "Day of Remembrance for the victims of the Crimean Tatar genocide". 

==Background==
{{main|History of Crimea}}
[[File:Black Sea with the Crimea highlighted.svg|thumb|[[Crimea]] highlighted on a map of the [[Black Sea]]]]
The [[Crimean Tatars]] controlled the [[Crimean Khanate]] from 1441 to 1783, when [[Crimea]] was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed by the Russian Empire]] as a target of [[Russian irredentism|Russian expansion]]. By the 14th century, most of the Turkic-speaking population of Crimea had adopted [[Islam]], following the conversion of [[Ozbeg Khan]] of the [[Golden Horde]]. It was the longest surviving state of the Golden Horde.{{sfn|Spring|2015|p=228}} They often engaged [[Russo-Crimean Wars|in conflicts with Moscow]]&amp;mdash;from 1468 until the 17th century, the Crimean Tatars made almost [[Crimean–Nogai raids into East Slavic lands|annual incursions into Slavic lands]], capturing many people used in the [[slave trade]],{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=27}} and were averse to the newly-established Russian rule. Thus, the Tatars began leaving Crimea in several waves of emigration. Between 1784 and 1790, out of a total population of about a million, around 300,000 Crimean Tatars left for the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Potichnyj|1975|pp=302–319}}

The [[Crimean War]] triggered another mass [[Emigration|exodus]] of Tatars. Between 1855 and 1866 at least 500,000 Muslims, and possibly up to 900,000, left the Russian Empire and emigrated to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Out of that number, at least one third were from Crimea, while the rest were from the [[Caucasus|Caucausus]]. These emigrants comprised 15&amp;ndash;23 percent of the total population of Crimea. The Russian Empire used that fact as the ideological foundation to further Russify "[[New Russia]]".{{sfn|Fisher|1987|pp=356–371}} Eventually, the Crimean Tatars became a minority in Crimea; in 1783, they comprised 98 percent of the population,{{sfn|Tanner|2004|p=22}} but by 1897, this was down to 34.1 percent.&lt;ref name="Vardys 101"/&gt; While Crimean Tatars were emigrating, the Russian government encouraged [[Russification]] of the peninsula, populating it with [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], and other [[Slavs|Slavic]] ethnic groups; this Russification continued during the Soviet era.&lt;ref name="Vardys 101"&gt;[[#Vardys|Vardys (1971)]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Evpatoria red terror corpses at sea coast.jpg|thumb|Corpses of victims of the winter 1918 [[Red Terror]] in [[Evpatoria]], Crimea]]
After the 1917 [[October Revolution]], Crimea received autonomous status inside the [[USSR]] on 18 October 1921,{{sfn|Smele|2015|p=302}} but [[collectivization]] in the 1920s led to severe famine from which up to 100,000 Crimeans perished when their crops were transported to "more important" regions of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Olson|Pappas|Pappas|1994|p=185}} By one estimate, three-quarters of the famine victims were Crimean Tatars.{{sfn|Smele|2015|p=302}} Their status deteriorated further after [[Joseph Stalin]] became the Soviet leader and implemented repressions that led to the deaths of at least 5.2 million Soviet citizens between 1927 and 1938.{{sfn|Rosefielde|1997|pp=321–331}}

===World War II===

In 1940, the [[Crimean Socialist Soviet Republic]] had approximately 1,126,800 inhabitants, of which 218,000 people, or 19.4 percent of the population, were Tatars.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=104}} In 1941, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded Eastern Europe]], annexing much of the western USSR. Tatars initially viewed the Germans as liberators from Stalinism, and they had also been positively treated by the Germans in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Williams 2015 p 92"&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2015)]], p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the captured Crimean Tatars serving in the [[Red Army]] were sent to POW camps after [[Romania in World War II|Romanians]] and Nazis came to [[Crimean Campaign|occupy]] the bulk of Crimea. Though Nazis initially called for murder of all "Asiatic inferiors", they revised this policy in the face of determined resistance from the Red Army. Beginning in 1942, Germans recruited Soviet prisoners of war to form support armies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2001)]], p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dobruja|Dobrucan]] Tatar nationalists [[Mustecip Fazil Ulkusal|Fazil Ulkusal]] and [[Mustafa Edige Kirimal|Edige Kirimal]] helped in freeing Crimean Tatars from German [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s and enlisting them in the independent Crimean support legion for the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. This legion eventually included eight battalions.&lt;ref name="Williams 2015 p 92"/&gt; From November 1941, German authorities allowed Tatars to establish Muslim Committees in various towns as a symbolic recognition of some local government authority, though they were not given any political power.{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=157}}

Some of the Crimean Tatars were also organized into [[Schutzmannschaft]] (police battalions) and [[Selbstschutz]] (self-defence) brigades to protect Crimean Tatar villages from the attacks and to track down the [[Soviet partisans]]. According to both German and Crimean Tatar evidence, the Germans persuaded between 15,000 and 20,000 Crimean Tatars to form self-defence battalions.{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=155}}  However, rather than uniformly support German forces, these units frequently sided with whoever was the strongest in an area. Soviet Communist partisans also raided Tartar villages as punishment for perceived collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2001)]], p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of the war, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] began enlisting every Eastern Muslim in its reach. In summer of 1944, 800 former soldiers of Tatar units who had been evacuated from Crimea to Romania were recruited into the Tatar SS Waffen Mountain Brigade or ''Tatarische Waffen-Gebirgs-Brigade der SS''. These fought in [[Hungary]] before integration into [[Wilhelm Hintersatz|Harun al-Rashid]]'s legions.{{sfn|Motadel|2014|p=235}}

However, not all Tatars joined the collaboration; Crimean Tatar [[Ahmet Özenbaşlı]], for instance, strongly opposed the occupation and nurtured secret contacts with the Soviet [[resistance movement]] to provide valuable strategic and political information.{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=157}} Other Crimean Tatars also fought on the side of the Soviet partisans, like the Tarhanov movement of 250 Tatars which fought throughout 1942 till its destruction.{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=160}} Furthermore, 25,033 Crimean Tatars fought in the [[Red Army]] during World War II,&lt;ref name="buckley209"&gt;[[#Buckley|Buckley, Ruble &amp; Hoffman (2008)]], p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; a greater number than the 15,000 to 20,000 persuaded to join the self-defence units that protected Tatar villages and also hunted down partisans.{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=155}}&lt;ref name="Williams 382"&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2001)]], pp. 382–384&lt;/ref&gt; Eight Crimean Tatars were even named the [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Skutsch|2013|p=1188}} In addition to this, even though the [[Volga Tatars]] actually participated in collaboration in higher number than the Crimean Tatars, with 35,000&amp;ndash;40,000 volunteers fighting with the Axis, they avoided any kind of collective punishment.{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=155}} Many other ethnicities were also Nazi collaborators, even numerous Russians and [[Jews of Crimea|Jews]], suggesting that some people in the occupied territories had been forcibly drafted.&lt;ref name="Williams 382"/&gt;

Up to 130,000 people died during the Axis occupation of Crimea.{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=156}} The Nazis implemented a brutal repression, destroying more than 70 villages that were together home to about 25 percent of the Crimean Tatar population. Thousands of Crimean Tatars were forcibly transferred to work as ''[[Ostarbeiter]]'' in German factories under the supervision of the [[Gestapo]] in what were described as "vast slave workshops", resulting in loss of all Crimean Tatar support.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2001)]], p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis considered the Crimean Tatars and various other nations as "people of a lower race."{{sfn|Fisher|2014|pp=151–152}} In April 1944 the Red Army managed to repel the [[Axis forces]] from the peninsula in the [[Crimean Offensive]].{{sfn|Allworth|1998|p=177}}

A majority of the [[hiwis]] (helpers), their families, and all those associated with the Muslim Committees were evacuated to Germany and [[Hungary in World War II|Hungary]] or Dobruca by the Wehrmacht and Romanian army where they joined the Eastern Turkic division. Thus, the majority of the collaborators had been evacuated from Crimea by the retreating Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Uehling|2004|p=38}} Many Soviet officials had also recognised this and rejected claims that the Crimean Tatars had betrayed Soviet Union ''en masse''. However, with the German retreat, voices demanding punishment of the Tatars grew louder. In addition, the presence of Muslim Committees organized from Berlin by Kirimal and other members of Turkish and Dobrucan diaspora appeared particularly damning in the eyes of the Soviet government. The linking of Tatars with Turkey by the "Crimean Turk" nationalists also increased suspicion.&lt;ref name="Williams 382"/&gt;

Ostensibly due to the [[collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II]], the Soviet government inflicted a [[collective guilt]] and punishment on ten ethnicities,{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=3}} among them the Crimean Tatars.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Banerji|Banerji, 23 October 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment included deportation to distant regions of [[Central Asia]] and [[Siberia]].{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=3}} Soviet accounts of the late 1940s indict the Tatars as an ethnicity of traitors, leaving no doubt as to the reasons for their deportation. Although refused by Crimean Tatars, this opinion was widely accepted in the Soviet period and persists in the Russian scholarly and popular literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2001)]], p. 374–375&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 1944, [[Lavrentiy Beria]] recommended to Stalin that the Crimean Tatars should be deported away from the border regions due to their "traitorous actions".{{sfn|Knight|1995|p=127}} Stalin subsequently issued GKO Order No. 5859ss, which envisaged the resettlement of the Crimean Tatars.&lt;ref name="buckley231"&gt;[[#Buckley|Buckley, Ruble &amp; Hoffman (2008)]], p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The deportation lasted only three days,{{sfn|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|2016}} 18&amp;ndash;20 May 1944, during which [[NKVD]] agents went house to house collecting Crimean Tatars at gunpoint and forcing them to enter sealed-off{{sfn|Weiner|2003|p=224}} cattle trains that would transfer them almost {{convert|3200|km|mi}}{{sfn|Tweddell|Kimball|1985|p=190}} to remote locations in the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]].

On 4 July 1944, the NKVD officially informed Stalin that the resettlement was complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pohl|Pohl (1999)]], p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, not long after that report, the NKVD found out that one of its units forgot to deport people from the [[Arabat Spit]]. Instead of preparing an additional transfer in trains, the NKVD boarded hundreds of Crimean Tatars onto an old boat, took it to the middle of the [[Azov Sea]], and sank the ship, on 20 July. Those who did not drown were finished off by [[machine-guns]].{{sfn|Levene|2013|p=317}}

Officially, Crimean Tatar were eliminated from Crimea. The deportation encompassed every person of Crimean Tatar descent, including children, women, and the elderly, and even those who had been members of the [[Communist Party]] or the [[Red Army]]. In March 1949, a total of 8,995 former soldiers of the Red Army of Crimean Tatar descent were registered in special settlements. Among these veterans, there were 534 officers, 1,392 sergeants, and 7,079 soldiers. There were also 742 members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and 1,225 members of [[Komsomol]].{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=1}} According to one Russian witness of the deportation, some men were still fighting at the Eastern front, but the deportation awaited them at the end of the war.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|p=691}} This was especially humiliating for war heroes; Ilyas Ablayev, for instance, fought on various fronts in the war and served in the Red Army until May 1947, only to then live in exile in the region of [[Tashkent]].{{sfn|Studies on the Soviet Union|1970|p=87}}

During this mass eviction, the Soviet authorities confiscated around 80,000 houses, 500,000 [[cattle]], 360,000 [[acres]] of land, and 40,000 tons of agricultural provisions.{{sfn|Sandole|Byrne|Sandole-Staroste|Senehi|2008|p=94}} In addition, all Crimean Tatars were fired from the Red Army. Besides 191,000 deported Tatars, the Soviet authorities also evicted 9,620 [[Armenians]], 12,420 [[Bulgarians]], and 15,040 [[Greeks in the former Soviet Union|Greeks]] from the peninsula. All were collectively branded as traitors and became second class citizens for decades in the USSR.{{sfn|Sandole|Byrne|Sandole-Staroste|Senehi|2008|p=94}} Among the deported, there were also 283 persons of other ethnicities: [[Italians]], Romanians, [[Crimean Karaites|Karaims]], [[Kurds]], [[Czechs]], [[Hungarians]], and [[Croats]].{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=46}} During 1947 and 1948, a further 2,012 veteran returnees were deported from Crimea by the local [[MVD]].{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=104}}

In total, 151,136 Crimean Tatars were deported to the Uzbek SSR; 8,597 to the [[Mari Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]; and 4,286 to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]]; and the remaining 29,846 were sent to various remote regions of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].{{sfn|Syed|Akhtar|Usmani|2011|p=298}} When the Crimean Tatars arrived at their destination in the Uzbek SSR, they were met with hostility by [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] locals who threw stones at them, even their children, because they heard that the Crimean Tatars were "traitors" and "fascist collaborators."{{sfn|Stronski|2010|pp=132–133}} The Uzbeks objected to becoming the "dumping ground for treasonous nations." In the coming years, several assaults against the Crimean Tatars population were registered, some of which were fatal.{{sfn|Stronski|2010|pp=132–133}}

[[File:Lavrenty Beria.jpg|right|thumb|Lavrentiy Beria, the chief of the Soviet NKVD]]
The mass Crimean deportations were organized by Lavrentiy Beria, the chief of the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, and his subordinates [[Bogdan Kobulov]], [[Ivan Serov]], B. P. Obruchnikov, M.G. Svinelupov, and A. N. Apolonov. The field operations were conducted by G. P. Dobrynin, the deputy Head of the [[Gulag]] system; G. A. Bezhanov, the Colonel of State Security; I. I. Piiashev, Major General; S. A. Klepov, Commissar of State Security; I. S. Sheredega, Lt. General; B. I. Tekayev, Lt. Colonel of State Security; and two local leaders, P. M. Fokin, head of the Crimea NKGB, and V. T. Sergjenko, Lt. General.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=104}} In order to execute this deportation, the NKVD secured 5,000 armed agents and the [[NKGB]] allocated a further 20,000 armed men, together with a few thousand regular soldiers.&lt;ref name="buckley231"/&gt; Two of Stalin's directives from May 1944 reveal that every aspect of the Soviet government, from financing to transit, was involved in executing the operation.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=104}}

On 14 July 1944 the GKO authorized the immigration of 51,000 people, mostly Russians, to 17,000 empty [[collective farms]] on Crimea. On 30 June 1945, the [[Crimean ASSR]] was abolished.&lt;ref name="buckley231"/&gt;

[[Soviet propaganda]] sought to hide the population transfer by claiming that the Crimean Tatars had "voluntarily resettle[d] to Central Asia".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2001)]], p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, though, according to historian [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], Crimea was "[[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]]."{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|p=690}} After this act, the term "Crimean Tatar" was banished from the Russian-Soviet lexicon, and all Tatar [[toponyms]] (names of towns, villages, and mountains) in Crimea were changed to Russian names on all maps. Muslim graveyards and religious objects in Crimea were demolished or converted into secular places.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|p=690}} During Stalin's rule, nobody was allowed to mention that this ethnicity even existed in the USSR. This went so far that many individuals were even forbidden to declare themselves as Crimean Tatars during the [[Soviet Census (1959)|Soviet censuses of 1959]], [[Soviet Census (1970)|1970]], and 1979. They could only declare themselves as Tatars. This ban was lifed during the [[1989 Soviet census|Soviet census of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Buckley|Buckley, Ruble &amp; Hoffman (2008)]], p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The first deportees started arriving in the Uzbek SSR on 29 May 1944 and most had arrived by 8 June 1944.{{sfn|Kamenetsky|1977|p=244}} The consequent [[mortality rate]] remains disputed; the NKVD kept incomplete records of the death rate among the resettled ethnicities living in exile. Like the other deported peoples, the Crimean Tatars were placed under the regime of [[special settlement (Soviet)|special settlements]]. Many of those deported performed [[forced labor]]:{{sfn|Uehling|2004|p=38}} their tasks included working in [[coal mines]] and construction battalions, under the supervision of the NKVD. Deserters were executed.{{sfn|Pohl|2000|pp=3–4}} Special settlers routinely worked eleven to twelve hours a day, seven days a week.{{sfn|Viola|2007|p=99}} Despite this difficult physical labor, the Crimean Tatars were given only around {{convert|200|g}}{{sfn|Kucherenko|2016|p=85}} to {{convert|400|g}} of bread per day.{{sfn|Reid|2015|p=204}} Accommodations were insufficient; some were forced to live in [[mud hut]]s where "there were no doors or windows, nothing, just reeds" on the floor to sleep on.{{sfn|Lillis|2014}}

The sole transport to these remote areas and [[labour colonies]] was equally as strenuous. Theoretically, the NKVD loaded 50 people into each railroad car, together with their property.{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=4}} One witness claimed that 133 people were in her wagon.{{sfn|Reid|2015}} They had only one hole in the floor of the wagon which was used as a toilet.{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=4}} Some pregnant women were forced to give birth inside these sealed-off railroad cars.{{sfn|Uehling|2004|p=3}} The conditions in the overcrowded train wagons were exacerbated by a lack of [[hygiene]], leading to cases of [[typhus]].{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=4}} Since the trains only stopped to open the doors at rare occasions during the trip, the sick inevitably contaminated others in the wagons.{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=4}} It was only when they arrived at their destination in the Uzbek SSR that the Crimean Tatars were released from the sealed-off railroad cars.{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=4}} Still, some were redirected to other destinations in Central Asia and had to continue their journey. Some witnesses claimed that they traveled for 24 consecutive days.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=33}} During this whole time, they were given very little food or water while trapped inside.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|p=690}} There was no fresh air, since the doors and windows were bolted shut. In [[Kazakh SSR]], the transport guards unlocked the door only to toss out the corpses along the railroad. The Crimean Tatars thus called these railcars "[[crematoria]] on wheels."{{sfn|Allworth|1998|p=155}} The records show that at least 7,889 Crimean Tatars died during this long journey, amounting to about 4 percent of their entire ethnicity.{{sfn|Garrard|Healicon|1993|p=168}}

The high mortality rate continued for several years in exile due to [[malnutrition]], [[labor exploitation]], diseases, lack of medical care, and exposure to the harsh desert climate of Uzbekistan.{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=7}} The exiles were frequently assigned to the heaviest construction sites. The Uzbek medical facilities filled with Crimean Tatars who were susceptible to the local Asian diseases not found on Crimean peninsula where the water was purer, including [[yellow fever]], [[dystrophy]], [[malaria]], and intestinal illness.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=106}} The [[death toll]] was the highest during the first five years. In 1949 the Soviet authorities counted the population of the deported ethnic groups who lived in special settlements. According to their records, there were 44,887 [[excess death]]s in these five years, 19.6 percent of that total group.&lt;ref name="buckley207"&gt;[[#Buckley|Buckley, Ruble &amp; Hofmann (2008)]], p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Uehling|2004|p=38}} Other sources give a figure of 44,125 deaths during that time,{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=9}} while a third source, using alternative NKVD archives, gives a figure of 32,107 deaths.{{sfn|Ukrainian Congress Committee of America|2004|pp=43–44}} These reports included all the people resettled from Crimea (including Armenians, Bulgarians, and Greeks), but the Crimean Tatars formed a  majority in this group. It took five years until the number of births among the deported people started to surpass the number of deaths.{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=7}} Soviet archives reveal that between May 1944 and January 1945 a total of 13,592 Crimean Tatars perished in exile, about 7 percent of their entire population.{{sfn|Amnesty International|1973|pp=160–161}} Almost half of all deaths (6,096) were of children under the age of 16; another 4,525 were adult women and 2,562 were adult men. During 1945, a further 13,183 people died.{{sfn|Amnesty International|1973|pp=160–161}} Thus, by the end of December 1945, at least 27,000 Crimean Tatars had already died in exile.{{sfn|Moss|2008|p=17}} One Crimean Tatar woman living near Tashkent recalled the events from 1944:

{{quote|My parents were moved from Crimea to Uzbekistan in May 1944. My parents had sisters and brothers, but when they arrived in Uzbekistan, the only survivors were themselves. My parents' sisters and brothers and parents all died in transit because of catching bad colds and other diseases.... My mother was left completely alone and her first work was to cut trees.{{sfn|Dadabaev|2015|p=56}}}}

Estimates produced by Crimean Tatars indicate mortality figures that were far higher and amounted to 46% of their population living in exile.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=34}} In 1968, when [[Leonid Brezhnev]] presided over the USSR, Crimean Tatar activists were persecuted for using that high mortality figure under the guise that it was a "slander to the USSR." In order to show that Crimean Tatars were exaggerating, the KGB published figures showing that "only" 22 percent of that ethnic group died.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=34}} The Karachai demographer D. M. Ediev estimates that 34,300 Crimean Tatars died due to the deportation, representing an 18 percent mortality rate.&lt;ref name="buckley207"/&gt; Hannibal Travis estimates that overall 40,000&amp;ndash;80,000 Crimean Tatars died in exile.{{sfn|Travis|2010|p=334}} Professor Michael Rywkin gives a figures of at least 42,000 Crimean Tatars who died between 1944 and 1951, including 7,900 who died during the transit{{sfn|Rywkin|1994|p=67}}—J. Otto Pohl concludes this would mean that at least 20% of their population died as a consequence of this policy. Pohl described it as "one of the worst cases of ethnically motivated mass murder of the 20th century."{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=10}} Professor [[Brian Glyn Williams]] gives a figure of between 40,000 and 44,000 deaths as a consequence of this deportation.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=109}} The Crimean State Committee estimated that 45,000 Crimean Tatars died between 1944 and 1948.

===Rehabilitation===
[[File:Demographics of Crimea.png|thumb|Chronology of the ethnic makeup of Crimea. The sharp drop of the Tatars is visible after the deportation.{{Legend|#ff002a|Crimean Tatars}}]]

Stalin's government denied the Crimean Tatars the right to education or [[publication]] in their native language. Despite the prohibition, and although they had to study in Russian or [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], they maintained their cultural identity.{{sfn|Pohl|2000|p=5}} In 1956 the new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|held a speech]] in which he condemned Stalin's policies, including the mass deportations of various ethnicities. Still, even though many peoples were allowed to return to their homes, three groups were forced to stay in exile: the [[Soviet Germans]], the [[Meskhetian Turks]], and the Crimean Tatars.{{sfn|Tanner|2004|p=31}} In 1954, Khrushchev allowed Crimea to be included in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] since Crimea is linked by land to Ukraine and not with the Russian SFSR.{{sfn|Requejo|Nagel|2016|p=179}} On 28 April 1956, the directive "On Removing Restrictions on the Special Settlement of the Crimean Tatars... Relocated during the Great Patriotic War" was issued, ordering a de-registration of the deportees and their release from administrative supervision. However, various other restrictions were still kept and the Crimean Tatars were not allowed to return to Crimea. Moreover, that same year the Ukrainian Council of Ministers banned the exiled Tatars, Greeks, Germans, Armenians and Bulgarians from relocating even to the [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], [[Zaporizhia Oblast|Zaporizhia]], [[Mykolaiv Oblast|Mykolaiv]] and [[Odessa Oblast]]s in the Ukrainian SSR.{{sfn|Bazhan|2015|p=182}} The Tatars did not get any compensation for their lost property.{{sfn|Tanner|2004|p=31}}

In the 1950s, the Crimean Tatars started actively advocating for the right to return. In 1957, they collected 6,000 signatures in a petition that was sent to the [[Supreme Soviet]] that demanded their [[political rehabilitation]] and return to Crimea.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=37}} In 1961 25,000 signatures were collected in a petition that was sent to the [[Kremlin]].{{sfn|Tanner|2004|p=31}}

[[Mustafa Dzhemilev]], who was only six months old when his family was deported from Crimea, grew up in Uzbekistan and became an activist advocating for the right of the Crimean Tatars to return. In 1966 he was arrested for the first time and spent a total of 17 years in prison during the Soviet era. This earned him the nicknamed the "Crimean Tatar [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]]."{{sfn|Vardy|Tooley|Vardy|2003|p=554}} In 1984 he was sentenced for the sixth time for "anti-Soviet activity," but was given moral support by Soviet dissident [[Andrei Sakharov]] who had observed Dzhemilev's fourth trial in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shabad|Shabad, 11 March 1984]]&lt;/ref&gt; When older dissidents were arrested, a new, younger generation would emerge that would replace them.{{sfn|Tanner|2004|p=31}}

On 21 July 1967, the representatives of the Crimean Tatars, led by dissident [[Ayshe Seytmuartova]], gained permission to meet with high-ranking Soviet officials in Moscow, including [[Yuri Andropov]]. During the meeting, the Crimean Tatars demanded a correction of all the injustices that the USSR did to their people. In September 1967 the [[Supreme Soviet]] issued a decree that granted amnesty to Crimean Tatars with regards to their charges of mass treason during World War II and also gave them more rights in the USSR. Still, though, the Crimean Tatars did not get what they wanted the most: the right to return to Crimea. The carefully worded decree stated that "The citizens of Tatars nationality who had formerly been living on Crimea […] have taken root in the Uzbek SSR."{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=165}} Individuals united and formed groups that went back to Crimea in 1968 on their own, without state permission—only for the Soviet authorities to deport 6,000 of them once again.&lt;ref name="Williams425"&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2001)]], p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable example of such resistance was Crimean Tatar activist [[Musa Mahmut]], who had been deported when he was 12 and who returned to Crimea because he wanted to see his home again. When the police informed him that he would be evicted, he poured gasoline over his body and set himself on fire.&lt;ref name="Williams425"/&gt; Despite this, 577 families managed to obtain state permission to reside in Crimea.{{sfn|Tanner|2004|p=32}}

In 1968 unrest erupted among the Crimean Tatar people in the Uzbek city of [[Chirchiq]].{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=127}} In October 1973 Jewish poet and professor [[Ilya Gabay]] committed suicide by jumping off a building in Moscow. He was one of the significant Jewish dissidents in the USSR who fought for the rights of the oppressed peoples, especially Crimean Tatars. Gabay was arrested and sent to a [[labour camp]], but still insisted on his cause because he was convinced that the treatment of Crimean Tatars by the USSR amounted to genocide.{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=150}} That same year, Dzhemilev was also arrested.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=129}}

Despite the process of [[de-Stalinization]], it was not until [[Perestroika]] and the ascent of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to power in the late 1980s that things started to change. In 1987 Crimean Tatar activists organized a protest in the center of Moscow near the Kremlin.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=37}} This compelled Gorbachev to form a commission to look into this matter. The first conclusion of the commission, led by hardliner [[Andrei Gromyko]], was that there was "no basis to renew autonomy and grant Crimean Tatars the right to return," but Gorbachev ordered a second commission that recommended the renewal of autonomy for Crimean Tatars.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=38}} Finally, in 1989, the ban on the return of the deported ethnicities was officially declared null and void;  the [[Supreme Council of Crimea]] also issued a declaration on 14 November 1989 that the previous deportations of peoples were a criminal activity.{{sfn|Sandole|Byrne|Sandole-Staroste|Senehi|2008|p=94}} This paved the way for 260,000 Crimean Tatars to return to their homeland. That same year, Dzhemilev returned to Crimea, and by 1 January 1992 at least 166,000 other Crimean Tatars had done the same.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kamm|Kamm, 8 February 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 Russian law ''[[On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples]]'' addressed the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation of all ethnicities]] repressed in the Soviet Union. It adopted measures which involved the "abolition of all previous RSFSR laws relating to illegal forced deportations" and called for the "restoration and return of the cultural and spiritual values and archives which represent the heritage of the repressed people."{{sfn|Bugay|1996|p=213}}

By 2004 the Crimean Tatars formed 12 percent of the population of Crimea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#BBC News|BBC News, 18 May 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the return of Crimean Tatars was not a simple process: in 1989, when they started their mass return, various [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalists]] staged protests in Crimea under the slogan: "Tatar traitors - Get out of Crimea!" Several clashes between locals and Crimean Tatars were reported in 1990 near [[Yalta]], which compelled the army to intervene to calm the situation. Local Soviet authorities were reluctant to help Crimean Tatar returnees find a job or a residence.{{sfn|Garrard|Healicon|1993|p=173}} The returnees found 517 abandoned Crimean Tatar villages, but bureaucracy constrained their efforts to restore them.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=37}} During 1991 at least 117 Crimean Tatar families lived in tents in two meadows near [[Simferopol]], waiting for the authorities to grant them a permanent residence.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=44}} After the [[dissolution of the USSR]], Crimea found itself a part of [[Ukraine]], but [[Kiev]] gave only limited support to Crimean Tatar settlers. Some 150,000 of the returnees were granted citizenship automatically under Ukraine's [[Citizenship law of Ukraine|Citizenship Law]] of 1991, but 100,000 who returned after the country declared independence faced several obstacles, including a costly bureaucratic process.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Prokopchuk|Prokopchuk, 8 June 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the exile lasted for almost 50 years, some Crimean Tatars decided to stay in Uzbekistan, which led to the separation of families who had decided to return to Crimea.{{sfn|Uehling|2002|pp=388–408}} By 2000 there were 46,603 recorded appeals of returnees who demanded a piece of land. A majority of these applications were rejected. Around the larger cities, such as [[Sevastopol]], a Crimean Tatar was on average given only 0.04 acres of land, which was of poor quality or unsuitable for farming.&lt;ref name="buckley237"&gt;[[#Buckley|Buckley, Ruble &amp; Hoffman (2008)]], p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukrainian-Canadian historian [[Peter J. Potichnyj]] concludes that the dissatisfaction of the Crimean Tatars over their life in exile mirrors a broader picture of non-Russian ethnic groups of the USSR that started to publicly express their anger against injustices perpetrated by the [[Russian irredentism|Greater Russian]] ideologists.{{sfn|Potichnyj|1975|pp=302–319}} In 1985 an essay by Ukrainian journalist [[Vasil Sokil]] entitled ''Forgetting Nothing, Forgetting No One'' was published in the Russian ''emigre'' journal ''Kontinent''. In an often sarcastic manner, it highlighted the selectively forgotten Soviet citizens and ethnicities who suffered during World War II, but whose experiences disrupt the official Soviet narrative of a heroic victory: "''Many endured all the tortures of [[Hitler]]'s concentration camps only to be sent to the Siberian [[gulag]]. […] What, in truth, does a human being need? Not much. Simply to be recognized as humans. Not as an animal.''" Sokil used the experience of the Crimean Tatars as an example of the ethnicities who were denied this recognition.{{sfn|Finnin|2011|pp=1091–1124}}

Between 1989 and 1994, around a quarter of a million Crimean Tatars migrated from Central Asia to Crimea. This was seen as a symbolic victory of their efforts to return to their native land.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=323–347}} They returned after 45 years of exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2001)]], p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

Not one of the ten ethnic groups who were deported during Stalin's era received any kind of compensation.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1991|p=3}} Some Crimean Tatar groups and activists have called for the international community to put pressure on the Russian Federation, the [[successor state]] of the USSR, to finance rehabilitation of that ethnicity and provide [[financial compensation]] for forcible resettlement.{{sfn|Allworth|1998|p=356}}

Despite the thousands of Crimean Tatars in the Red Army when it [[Battle of Berlin|attacked Berlin]], Soviet suspicion focused on this particular group.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams|Williams (2001)]], p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians explain this as part of Stalin's plan to take complete control of Crimea. The Soviet [[Turkish Straits crisis|sought access]] to the [[Dardanelles]] and control of territory in [[Turkey]], where the Crimean Tatars had ethnic kinsmen. By painting the Crimean Tatars as traitors, this taint could be extended to their kinsmen.{{sfn|Skutsch|2013|p=1188}} Scholar [[Walter Kolarz]] alleges that the deportation and liquidation of Crimean Tatars as an ethnicity in 1944 was just the final act of the centuries-long process of Russian colonization of Crimea that started in 1783.{{sfn|Potichnyj|1975|pp=302–319}} Historian [[Gregory Dufaud]] regards the Soviet accusations against Crimean Tatars as a convenient excuse for their forcible transfer through which Moscow secured an unrivaled access to the geostrategic southern [[Black Sea]] on one hand and eliminated hypothetical rebellious nations at the same time.{{sfn|Dufaud|2007|pp=151–162}} Professor of Russian and Soviet history Rebecca Manley similarly concluded that the real aim of the Soviet government was to "cleanse" the border regions of "unreliable elements".{{sfn|Manley|2012|p=40}} Professor [[Brian Glyn Williams]] states that the deportations of [[Meskhetian Turks]], despite never being close to the scene of combat and never being charged with any crime, lends the strongest credence to the fact that the deportations of Crimeans and Caucasians was due to Soviet foreign policy rather that any real "universal mass crimes".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams2002|Williams (2002)]], p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014 the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] unfolded, which was in turn declared illegal by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] ([[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262]]) and which led to further deterioration of the rights of the Crimean Tatars. Even though the [[Russian Federation]] issued decree No. 268 "On the Measures for the Rehabilitation of Armenian, Bulgarian, Greek, Crimean Tatar and German Peoples and the State Support of Their Revival and Development" on 21 April 2014,{{sfn|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|2014|p=15}} in practice it has treated Crimean Tatars with far less care. The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] issued a warning against the Kremlin in 2016 because it "intimidated, harassed and jailed Crimean Tatar representatives, often on dubious charges",{{sfn|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|2016}} while the [[Mejlis]], their representative body, was banned.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nechepurenko|Nechepurenko, 26 April 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:2016_Memorial_day_of_Deportation_of_the_Crimean_Tatars_in_Kyiv_15.jpg|right|thumb|An event commemorating the victims of the Crimean Tatar deportation in [[Kiev]] in 2016]]

The UN reported that over 10,000 people left Crimea after the annexation in 2014, mostly Crimean Tatars,&lt;ref&gt;[[#UN News Centre|UN News Centre, 20 May 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; which caused a further decline of their fragile community. Crimean Tatars stated several reasons for their departure, among them insecurity, fear, and intimidation from the new Russian authorities.{{sfn|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|2014|p=13}} In its 2015 report, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that various [[human rights violations]] were recorded in Crimea, including the prevention of Crimean Tatars from marking the 71st anniversary of their deportation.{{sfn|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|2015|pp=40–41}} Dzhemilev, who was in [[Turkey]] during the annexation, was banned from entering Crimea for five years by the Russian authorities, thus marking the second time that he was evicted from his native land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reuters2014|Reuters, 22 April 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern interpretations by scholars and historians sometimes classify this mass deportation of civilians as a [[crime against humanity]],{{sfn|Wezel|2016|p=225}} [[ethnic cleansing]],{{sfn|Requejo|Nagel|2016|p=180}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=323–347}}{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|p=690}} [[depopulation]],{{sfn|Polian|2004|p=318}} an act of [[Stalinism|Stalinist repression]]{{sfn|Lee|2006|p=27}} or an "[[ethnocide]]", meaning a deliberate wiping out of an identity and culture of a nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Williams2002|Williams (2002)]], pp. 357–373&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dufaud|2007|pp=151–162}} The Crimean Tatars call this event ''Sürgünlik'' ("exile").{{sfn|Zeghidour|2014|pp=83–91}}

Some activists, politicians, scholars and historians go even further and consider this deportation a crime of [[genocide]].{{sfn|Tatz|Higgins|2016|p=28}}{{sfn|Uehling|2015|p=3}}{{sfn|Blank|2015|p=18}}{{sfn|Legters|1992|p=104}} Professor Lyman H. Legters argued that the Soviet penal system, combined with its resettlement policies, should count as genocidal since the sentences were borne most heavily specifically on certain ethnic groups, and that a relocation of these ethnic groups, whose survivial depends on ties to its particular homeland, "had a genocidal effect remediable only by restoration of the group to its homeland".{{sfn|Legters|1992|p=104}} Soviet dissidents Ilya Gabay{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=150}} and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]]{{sfn|Allworth|1998|p=216}} both classified the event as a genocide. Historian Timothy Snyder included it in a list of Soviet policies that “meet the standard of genocide.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/05/holocaust-secondworldwar|title=The fatal fact of the Nazi-Soviet pact|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|date=2010-10-05|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2015, the [[Ukrainian Parliament]] issued a resolution recognizing this event as genocide and established 18 May as the "Day of Remembrance for the victims of the Crimean Tatar genocide."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Radio Free Europe|Radio Free Europe, 21 January 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some academics disagree with the classification of deportation as genocide. Professor Alexander Statiev argues that Stalin's administration did not have a conscious genocidal intent to exterminate the various deported peoples, but that Soviet "political culture, poor planning, haste, and wartime shortages were responsible for the genocidal [[death rate]] among them." He rather considers these deportations an example of Soviet [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of "unwanted nations."{{sfn|Statiev|2010|pp=243–264}} According to Professor Amir Weiner, "...It was their territorial identity and not their physical existence or even their distinct [[ethnic identity]] that the regime sought to eradicate."{{sfn|Weiner|2002|pp=44–53}} According to Professor Francine Hirsch, "although the Soviet regime practiced politics of [[discrimination]] and [[Social exclusion|exclusion]], it did not practice what contemporaries thought of as ''[[racial politics]]''." To her, these mass deportations were based on the concept that nationalities were "sociohistorical groups with a shared consciousness and not racial-biological groups".{{sfn|Hirsch|2002|pp=30–43}}

===In popular culture===
[[File:ESC2016_winner%27s_press_conference_01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jamala]] dedicated her song ''[[1944 (song)|1944]]'' to the deported Crimean Tatars.]]

In 2008, [[Lily Hyde]], a British journalist living in Ukraine, published a novel titled ''Dreamland'' that revolves around a Crimean Tatar family return to their homeland in the 1990s. The story is told from the perspective of a 12-year-old girl who moves from Uzbekistan to a demolished village with her parents, brother, and grandfather. Her grandfather tells her stories about the heroes and victims among the Crimean Tatars.&lt;ref&gt;[[#O'Neil|O'Neil, 1 August 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Ukrainian [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar-language]] film ''[[Haytarma]]'' portrays Crimean Tatar [[test pilot]] and [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] [[Amet-khan Sultan]] against the background of the 1944 deportations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grytsenko|Grytsenko, 8 July 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Christina Paschyn released the documentary film ''A Struggle for Home: The Crimean Tatars'' in a Ukrainian&amp;ndash;Qatari co-production. It depicts the history of the Crimean Tatars from 1783 up until 2014, with a special emphasis on the 1944 mass deportation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam|International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Eurosong 2016|2016 Eurovision Song Contest]], the Ukrainian Crimean Tatar singer [[Jamala]] performed her song ''[[1944 (song)|1944]]'' which refers to the deportation of the Crimean Tatars in that year. Jamala, herself born in exile in [[Kyrgyzstan]], dedicated the song to her deported great-grandmother. She became the first Crimean Tatar to perform at the Eurovision Song Contest, which she won representing Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#John|John, 13 May 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''False advertising''' is the use of false, misleading, or unproven information to advertise products to [[consumer]]s or advertising that does not disclose its source.&lt;ref name="AMAdef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary 'Deceptive advertising'|url=https://www.ama.org/resources/Pages/Dictionary.aspx?dLetter=D|website=American Marketing Association|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://consumer.laws.com/deceptive-advertising/deceptive-advertising-definition|title=Deceptive Advertising Definition - Consumer {{!}} Laws.com|website=consumer.laws.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One form of false advertising is to claim that a product has a [[health benefit (medicine)|health benefit]] or contains vitamins or minerals that it in fact does not.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10431119|title=Ribena-maker fined $217,500 for misleading vitamin C ads|date=2007-03-27|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments use regulations to control false advertising. A false advertisement can further be classified as deceptive if the advertiser deliberately misleads the consumer, as opposed to making an honest mistake.

== Types of deception ==

===Photo retouching===

Often used in cosmetic and [[weight loss]] [[commercials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14304802|title=Airbrushed make-up ads banned for 'misleading'|last=|first=|date=2011|website=BBC News|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; these adverts portray false and unobtainable results to the consumer and give a false impression of the product's true capabilities. If retouching is not discovered or fixed, a company can be at a competitive advantage with consumers purchasing their seemingly more effective product, thus leaving competitors at a loss.

Advertisers for weight loss products may also employ athletes who are recovering from injuries for "[[before and after demonstration|before and after]]" demonstrations.

===Omitting information===

An ad may omit or skim over important information. The ad's claims may be technically true, but the ad does not include information that a reasonable person would consider relevant. For example, TV advertisements for prescription drugs may technically fulfill a regulatory requirement by displaying side-effects in a small font at the end of the ad, or have a "speed-talker" list them. This practice was prevalent in the United States in the recent past.

===Hidden fees and surcharges===
Hidden fees can be a way for companies to trick the unwary consumer into paying excess fees (for example tax, shipping fees, insurance etc.) on a product that was advertised at a specific price as a way to increase profit without raising the price on the actual item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/marketing/textbooks/boundless-marketing-textbook/pricing-8/pricing-legal-concerns-65/illegal-price-advertising-327-4069/ |title=Illegal Price Advertising |website=Boundless.com |date=2015-07-21 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fraud.laws.com/false-adversiting/surcharges-and-hidden-fees |title=Surcharges And Hidden Fees - Fraud &amp;#124; Laws.com |website=Fraud.laws.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common form of hidden fees and surcharges is "[[fine print]]" in advertising. Another way to hide fees that is commonly used is to not include "shipping fees" into the price of goods online. This makes an item look cheaper than it is once the shipping cost is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/fair-trading/fair-trading-act-fact-sheets/add-ons-and-hidden-fees/ |title=Add-ons and hidden fees &amp;#124; Commerce Commission |website=Comcom.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2366389/Scams-cons-TRUE-cost-budget-flight-How-dreams-bargain-holiday-spoiled-unsavoury-added-extras.html|title=Scams, cons and the TRUE cost of your budget flight: How our dreams of a bargain holiday are spoiled by unsavoury added extras|last=|first=|date=17 July 2013|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many hotels charge mandatory "[[resort fee]]s" that are not typically included in the advertised base price of the room.

===Manipulation of measurement units and standards===
Manipulation of measurement units and standards can be described as a seller deceiving customers by informing them with facts that either are not true or are using a standard or standards that wouldn’t be widely used or understood which results in the customer being misinformed or confused.

===Fillers and oversized packaging===
Some products are sold with [[filler (animal food)|filler]]s, which increase the legal weight of the product with something that costs the producer very little compared to what the consumer thinks that he or she is buying. Food is an example of this, where meat is injected with [[broth]] or even [[brine]] (up to 15%), or [[TV dinner]]s are filled with gravy or other sauce instead of meat. [[Malt]] and [[ham]] have been used as filler in [[peanut butter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wallechinsky | first = David | title = The People's Almanac | publisher = Doubleday | location = Garden City | year = 1975 | isbn = 0-385-04060-1 | page = 1010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also non-meat fillers which may look starchy in their makeup; they are high in carbohydrate and low in nutritional value. One example is known as a cereal binder and usually contains some combination of flours and oatmeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/food-fillers-101.htm|title=Food Fillers 101|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some products may have a large container where most of the space is empty, leading the consumer to believe that the total amount of food is greater than it actually is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/prosecutors-659218-unilever-county.html|title=O.C. DA's lawsuit may force Axe hair products to redesign containers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misleading health claims===
The words “Diet, low fat, [[sugar-free]], healthy and good for you” are labels they may see every day and they associate these labels with products that will aid a healthy lifestyle. It seems advertisers are aware of their needs to live longer and live well so they are adapting their products in accordance with this. It is suggested that [[food advertising]] influences consumer preferences and shopping habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://handbook.vla.vic.gov.au/handbook/16-applying-for-grant-of-legal-assistance/giving-false-information-or-omitting-relevant-information-in-application|title=Giving false information or omitting relevant information in the application|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Victoria Legal Aid|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by highlighting certain contents or ingredients is misleading consumers into thinking they are buying healthy when in fact they are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1011/11rp09|title=Marketing obesity?

Many large food companies are going to court after using misleading tactics like these:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/fat-free-and-100-natural-seven-food-labelling-tricks-exposed-25143|title=Fat free and 100% natural: seven food labeling tricks exposed|last=Jones|first=S.,|date=2014|website=The Conversation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using a tick panel above the [[Nutritional Labeling and Education Act|nutritional label]] and using large, bold font and brighter colors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Highlighting one healthy ingredient on the front of the packet with a big tick next to it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Using words like ''healthy'' and ''natural'' which are weasel claims – words that contradict the claims that may follow it. These are commonly used words where the meaning can be overlooked by consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Regulation/Heinz-is-latest-target-in-new-wave-of-false-advertising-lawsuits-over-all-natural-claims-and-GMOs|title=Heinz is latest target in new wave of false advertising lawsuits over ‘all natural’ claims and GMOs|last=Watson|first=E.,|date=2014|website=Food Navigator-USA. com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using words like ''help'' on the product labeling, misleading consumers into thinking it ‘will’ help.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/big-food-lobbying-tip-of-the-iceberg-exposed-23232|title=Big Food lobbying: tip of the iceberg exposed|first=Gary|last=Sacks|date=|website=TheConversation.com|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this is not always the case. There has been an increase in the number of large organizations going to court over misleading claims, stating that products are ‘school canteen approved’ or ‘all natural,’ hence claiming their products are healthy or only uses natural ingredients, but this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-11/two-junk-food-giants-fined-over-misleading-kids-health-food/7586108|title=Consumer watchdog fines junk food giants over misleading 'healthy' kids food|last=Lannin|first=S.,|date=2016|website=ABC NEWS|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Puffing ==
Puffing or ''[[puffery]]'' is the act of exaggerating a product's worth through the use of meaningless unsubstantiated terms, based on opinion rather than fact.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calderwood|first=James|date=1998|title=False &amp; deceptive advertising|url=|journal=Ceramic Industry|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include many superlatives and statements such as “greatest of all time”, “best in town” and “out of this world” or a restaurant claiming it had "the world’s best tasting food".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsieh Hsu Fang|first=Ching-Sheng Ya-Hui Wen-Chang|date=2010|title=The Relationship Between Deceptive Claims and Ad Effect: The Moderating Role of Humorous Ads|url=|journal=International Journal of Business and Information|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically puffing is not an illegal form of false advertising and can be looked at as a humorous way to grab and attract the attention of the consumer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Puffing may be able to be used as a defense against charges of deceptive advertising when it is formatted as an opinion rather than a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandran|first=Ravi|date=2004|title=CONSUMER PROTECTION (FAIR TRADING) ACT|url=|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it can also be used as a defense for misleading or deceptive advertising. For example, claims like ‘Top Quality’ can have regulatory and legal consequences and can be looked at as illegal misrepresentation, if not supported through the products capabilities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lysonski Duffy|first=Steven Michael F|date=1992|title=The New Zealand Fair Trading ACt of 1986: Deceptive Advertising|url=|journal=The Journal of Consumer Affairs|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toncar Fetscherin|first=Mark Marc|date=2012|title=A study of visual puffery in fragrance advertising|url=|journal=European Journal of Marketing|doi=10.1108/03090561211189239|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manipulation of terms===
[[File:Listerine advertisement, 1932.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Listerine]] advertisement, 1932. The FTC found that the claim of these advertisements, reduced likelihood of catching cold, was false.]]
Many terms have imprecise meanings. Depending on the jurisdiction, "[[organic food|organic]]" food may not have a clear legal definition, and "light" food has been variously used to mean low in [[calorie]]s, [[sugar]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[table salt|salt]], [[texture (food)|texture]], [[viscosity]], or even light in color. Labels such as "all-natural" are frequently used but are essentially meaningless in a legal sense.

Tobacco companies, for many years,{{When|date=September 2017}} used terms like ''low tar'', ''light'', ''ultra-light'' and ''mild'' in order to imply that products with such labels had less [[Health effects of tobacco|detrimental effects on health]], but in recent years{{When|date=September 2017}} the United States has banned manufacturers from labeling tobacco products with these terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |title=Light, Low, Mild or Similar Descriptors |url=http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/Labeling/ucm2023661.htm |date=22 June 2010 |access-date=12 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the US [[United Egg Producers]]' used an "Animal Care Certified" logo on [[egg carton]]s, the [[Better Business Bureau]] argued that it misled consumers by conveying a higher sense of [[animal husbandry|animal care]] than was actually the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/04/business/media/egg-producers-relent-on-industry-seal.html | work=The New York Times | title=Egg Producers Relent on Industry Seal | first=Alexei | last=Barrionuevo | date=4 October 2005 | access-date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Kellogg's [[Rice Krispies]] cereal claimed that the cereal can improve a child’s immunity. The company was forced to discontinue all advertising stating such claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/04/kellogg-settles-rice-krispies-false-ad-case/|title=Kellogg settles Rice Krispies false ad case|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the same company advertised their Kashi product as “all natural”, when it contained a variety of synthetic and artificial ingredients; Kellogg's paid $5 million to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/suit-prompts-kelloggs-drop-natural-labels-kashi-products-n100391|title= Suit Prompts Kellogg's to Drop "Natural" Labels on Kashi Products|website=NBC|language=en-US|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incomplete comparison===
{{Main article|Incomplete comparison}}
"Better" means one item is superior to another in some way, while "best" means it is superior to all others in some way. However, advertisers frequently fail to list the way in each they are being compared (price, size, quality, etc.) and, in the case of "better", to what they are comparing (a competitor's product, an earlier version of their own product, or nothing at all). So, without defining how they are using the terms ''better'' and ''best'', the terms become meaningless. An ad which claims "Our cold medicine is better" could be just saying it is an improvement over taking nothing at all. Another often-seen example of this ploy is "better than the leading brand" often with some statistic attached, while the leading brand is often left undefined.

===Inconsistent comparison===
{{Main article|Inconsistent comparison}}
In an inconsistent comparison, an item is compared with many others, but only compared with each on the attributes where it wins, leaving the false impression that it is the best of all products, in all ways. One variation on this theme is web sites which also list some competitor prices for any given search, but do not list those competitors which beat their price (or the web site might compare their own sale prices with the regular prices offered by their competitors).

===Misleading illustrations===
One common example is that of [[serving suggestion]] pictures on food product boxes, which show additional ingredients beyond those included in the package. Although the "serving suggestion" disclaimer is a legal requirement of an illustration which includes items not included in the purchase, if a customer fails to notice or understand this caption, they may incorrectly assume that all depicted items are all included.

In some advertised images of [[hamburger]]s, every ingredient is visible from the side shown in the advertisement, giving the impression that they are larger than they really are.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Products which are sold unassembled or unfinished may also have a picture of the finished product, without a corresponding picture of what the customer is actually buying.

Commercials for certain video games include trailers that are essentially CGI short-films - with graphics of a much higher caliber than the actual game.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===False coloring===
“The color of food packaging is considered to be extremely important in the marketing world” (Blackbird, Fox &amp; Tornetta, 2013) as people see color before they absorb anything else. Consumers buy items based on the color they’ve seen it on the advertisement and they have a perception of what the packaging colors should also look like. However, when it comes to buying food, usually consumers can only judge the product based on the packaging and usually consumers judge products based on color.

When used to make people think food is riper, fresher, or otherwise healthier than it really is, [[food coloring]] can be a form of deception. When combined with added sugar or corn syrup, bright colors give the subconscious impression of healthy, ripe fruit, full of [[antioxidant]]s and [[phytochemical]]s.

One variation is packaging which obscures the true color of the foods contained within, such as red mesh bags containing yellow oranges or grapefruit, which then appear to be a ripe orange or red. Regularly stirring minced meat on sale at a deli can also make the meat on the surface stay red, causing it to appear fresh, while it would quickly oxidize and brown, showing its true age, if left unstirred. Some sodas are also sold in colored bottles, when the actual product is clear.

===Angel dusting===
[[Angel dusting]] is a process where an ingredient which would be beneficial, in a reasonable quantity, is instead added in an insignificant quantity which will have no consumer benefit, so they can make the claim that it contains that ingredient, and mislead the consumer into expecting that they will gain the benefit. For example, a cereal may claim it contains "12 essential vitamins and minerals", but the amounts of each may be only 1% or less of the [[Reference Daily Intake]], providing virtually no benefit to nutrition.

==="Chemical free"===
{{main|Chemical free}}
Many products come with some form of the statement "chemical free!" or "no chemicals!". As everything on Earth, save a few elementary particles formed by [[radioactive decay]] or present in minute quantities from [[solar wind]] and sunlight, is made of [[chemicals]], it is impossible to have a chemical free product. The intention of this message is often to indicate the product contains no synthetic or exceptionally harmful chemicals, but as the word chemical itself has a stigma, it is often used without clarification.

===Bait-and-switch===
{{main article|Bait-and-switch}}
Bait-and-switch is a deceptive form of advertising or marketing tactic generally used to lure in customers into the store. A company will advertise their product at a very cheap and enticing price which will attract the customers (bait). However, the product the customer seeks is not available for various reasons, such as the company only having a limited quantity of product available for sale which was quickly sold out (switch). After which, the store/company will then try to sell something that is more expensive and valuable than what they originally advertised (upsell). Regardless of the fact that only a small percentage of the shoppers will actually buy the more expensive product, the advertiser using the bait remains to gain profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bait-switch.asp |title=Bait And Switch Definition |website=Investopedia |date=2014-04-11 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bait advertising is also commonly used in other contexts, for example, in online job advertisements by deceiving the potential candidate about working conditions, pay, or different variables. Airlines may be guilty of "baiting" their potential clients with a bargains, then increase the cost or change the notice to be that of a considerably more costly flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1407/bait-advertising|title=What is Bait Advertising? - Definition from Techopedia|author=|date=|website=Techopedia.com|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses are asked to remember a few guidelines to avoid charges of misleading or deceptive conduct:
* Reasonable timeframe, reasonable quantities - Businesses must supply publicized merchandise or services at the promoted cost for a sensible or expressed timeframe and in sensible or expressed amounts. There is no exact meaning of what is implied by a 'sensible timeframe' or 'sensible amounts'. 
* Qualifying statements - General qualifying statements, for example, 'in store and online now' could at present still leave a business open to charges of bait advertising if sensible amounts of the publicized item are not accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.nt.gov.au/ForConsumers/Youth/BuyingStuff/Pages/Bait-Advertising.aspx |title=Bait Advertising - Department of the Attorney-General and Justice - NT Consumer Affairs |website=Consumeraffairs.nt.gov.au |date=2016-01-06 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Advertising deadlines - Companies need to have good grounds to trust that the merchandise will be accessible
* Rain checks - When, through no shortcoming of its own, a business can't supply merchandise or services as promoted companies ought to have a framework set up to supply or acquire the supply of the merchandise or benefits at the promoted cost as quickly as time permits.
* Online claims - If a company is an online-based company, it is essential for them to keep everything on their website updated to avoid misleading customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/fair-trading/fair-trading-act-fact-sheets/bait-advertising/ |title=Bait advertising &amp;#124; Commerce Commission |website=Comcom.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries bait advertising can result in severe penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.mtansw.com.au/13/feb/files/BaitAdvertising.pdf |format=PDF |title=Misleading and Deceptive Conduct: Bait Advertising |website=Journal.mtansw.com.au |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guarantee without a remedy specified===
If a company does not say what they will do if the product fails to meet expectations, then they are free to do very little. This is due to a [[legal technicality]] that states that a [[contract]] cannot be enforced unless it provides a basis not only for determining a breach but also for giving a remedy in the event of a breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Restatement (Second) of Contracts §33 | url = http://lexinter.net/LOTWVers4/certainty.htm|website=Lexinter.net | access-date = June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="No risk"===
Advertisers frequently claim there is no risk to trying their product, when clearly there is. For example, they may charge the customer's credit card for the product, offering a full refund if not satisfied. However, the risks of such an offer are numerous. Customers may not get the product at all, they may be billed for things they did not want, they may need to call the company to authorize a return and be unable to do so, they may not be refunded the shipping and handling costs, or they may be responsible for the return shipping.

Similarly, a ‘free trial’ is an advertising manoeuvre to have consumers become hands-on with the products or services before purchase, without any money spent but a free trial in exchange for credit cards details cannot be stated as a free trial, as there is a component of expenditure.&lt;ref name="eighmey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eighmey | first1 = J | year = 2014 | title = My Experience as Deputy Assistant Director for National Advertising at the Federal Trade Commission | url = | journal = Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 202–204 | doi=10.1509/jppm.14.ftc.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2753/JOA0091-3367380106| title = The Current State of Advertising Ethics: Industry and Academic Perspectives| journal = Journal of Advertising| volume = 38| pages = 83| year = 2009| last1 = Drumwright| first1 = Minette E.| last2 = Murphy| first2 = Patrick E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceptance by default===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}This refers to a contract or agreement where no response is interpreted as a positive response in favor of the business. An example of this is where a customer must explicitly "opt out" of a particular feature or service, or be charged for that feature or service. Another example is where a subscription automatically renews unless the customer explicitly requests it to stop.

==Regulation and enforcement==

=== United States ===
In the United States, the federal government regulates advertising through the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC),&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally enables private litigation through various statutes, most significantly the [[Lanham Act]] (trademark and unfair competition).

The goal is prevention rather than punishment, reflecting the purpose of civil law in setting things right rather than that of criminal law. The typical sanction is to order the advertiser to stop its illegal acts, or to include disclosure of additional information that serves to avoid the chance of deception. Corrective advertising may be mandated,&lt;ref&gt;Johar, Gita, "Intended and Unintended Effects of Corrective Advertising on Beliefs and Evaluations: An Exploratory Analysis", Journal of Consumer Psychology, 1996, 5(3), 209-230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johar | first1 = Gita Venkataramani | authorlink = Gita Johar | last2 = Simmons | first2 = Carolyn J. | year = 2000 | title = The Use of Concurrent Disclosures to Correct Invalid Inferences | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 307–322 | doi=10.1086/209565}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no fines or prison time except for the infrequent instances when an advertiser refuses to stop despite being ordered to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, ''id''; ''Policy Statement on Deception'', 103 FTC Decisions 110 (1984), appendix to ''Cliffdale Associates''; originally a letter from FTC Chairman James C. Miller to Rep. John D. Dingell (October 14, 1983). For the history of changing from deception to deceptiveness as the standard, see Preston, Ivan L., ''The Great American Blow-Up: Puffery in Advertising and Selling'', [[University of Wisconsin Press]], revised ed. (1996), at Ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 and 2014, the United States Supreme Court reviewed two false advertising cases: ''[[Static Control v. Lexmark]]'' (concerning who has standing to sue under the Lanham Act for false advertising) and ''[[POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.]]''.

State governments have a variety of unfair competition laws, which regulate false advertising, trademarks, and related issues. Many are very similar to that of the FTC, and in many cases copied so closely that they are known as "Little FTC Acts."&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. N.Y. ISC. Law §§ 2401-2409.&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, one such statute is the [[California Unfair Competition Law|Unfair Competition Law]] (UCL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/CIV/5/d3/4/1.5/3/s1770|title=California Civil Code - CIV § 1770 - FindLaw|work=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCL “borrows heavily from section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act” but has developed its own body of case law.&lt;ref&gt;California Antitrust &amp; Unfair Competition Law (Third), Volume 2: Unfair Competition (State Bar of California, 2003 Daniel Mogin &amp; Danielle S. Fitzpatrick, eds.) at pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Advertising in the UK is managed under the [[Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008]]&lt;ref name="ot2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/284442/oft1008.pdf|title=Office of Trading. (2008). Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading. Department of Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. United Kingdom Government.|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CPR), effectively the successor to the [[Trade Descriptions Act 1968]]. It is designed to implement the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], part of a common set of European minimum standards for consumer protection and legally bind advertisers in England, Scotland, Wales and parts of Ireland.&lt;ref name="eighmey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ot2008"/&gt; These regulations focus on ''business to consumer'' interactions. These are modelled by a table used for assessing unfairness, evaluations being made against four tests expressed in the regulations that indicate deceptive advertising: 
* ''Contrary to the requirements of professional diligence'' 
* ''False or deceptive practice in relation to a specific list of key factors'' 
* ''Omission of material information (unclear or untimely information)'' 
* ''Aggressive practice by harassment, coercion or undue influence'' 
These factors of deceptive advertising are critically analysed as they may crucially impair a consumer's ability to make an informed decision, thereby limiting their freedom of choice.

This system resembles American practice as reflected by the [[FTC regulation of behavioral advertising|FTC]] in terms of disallowing false and deceptive messaging, prohibition of unfair and unethical commercial practices and omitting important information, but it differs in ''monitoring aggressive sales practices'' (regulation seven) which included high-pressure sales practices that go beyond persuasion. Harassment and coercion are not defined but rather interpreted as any undue physical and psychological pressure (in advertising).

Even if proven cases of false advertising do not inevitably result in civil or criminal repercussions: the [[Office of Fair Trading]] states ''in the instance of false advertising, companies are not always faced with civil and criminal repercussions, it is based on the seriousness of the infringement'' and each case is analysed individually, allowing the standards authority to promote compliance with regards to their enforcement policies, priorities and available resources. Another area of departure from American practice relates to a ''general prohibition on the use of competitors' logotypes, trademarks or similar copy to that used in a competitor's own advertising by another, particularly when making a comparison''.

Under CPR legislation, there are different standards authorities for each country:
* In England and Wales, standards offences are handled by the [[Trading Standards|Local Authority Trading Standards Services]] (TSS) 
* In Northern Ireland by the [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] 
* In Scotland, offences are evaluated by. and potentially prosecuted through, the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown Office and the Procurator Fiscal Service]] on behalf of the [[Lord Advocate]].

The ACCC is designed to assist both consumers, businesses, industries and infrastructure within the country. The ACCC assists the consumer by making available the rights, regulations, obligations and procedures; for refund and return, complaints, faulty products and guarantees of products and services. They also assist businesses and industries by developing clear laws and guidelines in relation to unfair practices and misleading or deceptive conduct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are many similarities in the laws and regulation between the Australian ACCC, the New Zealand FTA, the American FCT and United Kingdom CPR. The structure of these policies is to support fair trade and competition alongside offering the consumers exactly what they are selling, in order to reduce deceptive and false practices. However, it is not limited to these countries, as most countries have agreements with the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network or ICPEN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icpen.org/|title=International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network|last=|first=|date=October 24, 2016|website=ICPEN|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Fair Trading Act 1986}}
In New Zealand, the [[Fair Trading Act 1986]] aims to promote fair competition and trading in the country.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/fair-trading/fair-trading-act-fact-sheets/what-is-the-fair-trading-act/|title=What is the Fair Trading Act ... {{!}} Commerce Commission|website=www.comcom.govt.nz|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/the-commission/about-us/|title=About us {{!}} Commerce Commission|website=www.comcom.govt.nz|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The act prohibits certain conduct in trade, provides for the disclosure of information available to the consumer relating to the supply of goods and services and promotes product safety. Although the Act does not require businesses to provide all information to consumers in every circumstances, businesses are obliged to ensure the information they do provide is accurate, and important information is not kept from consumers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumer.org.nz/articles/fair-trading-act|title=Fair trading act|website=Consumer NZ|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of selling methods that intend to mislead the consumer are illegal under the Fair Trading Act:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The Act also applies to certain activities whether or not the parties are 'in trade' – such as employment advertising, pyramid selling, and the supply of products covered by product safety and consumer information standards.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Both consumers and businesses alike can rely on and take their own legal action under the Act. Consumers may contact the trader and utilize their rights which have been stated in the Act to make headway with the trader. If the issues are not resolved, the consumer or anyone else can take actions under the Act. The [[Commerce Commission]] is also empowered to take enforcement action and will do so when allegations are sufficiently serious to meet its enforcement criteria.

Additionally, there are currently five consumer information standards:&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">'''Feis Ceoil''' ({{lang-en|Festival of Music}}) is an [[Ireland|Irish]] music organisation which holds an annual competitive festival of classical music. It was first organised in [[Dublin]] in 1897 by Dr. [[Annie Patterson]] and [[Edward Martyn]] for the purpose of stimulating musical studies in Ireland and encouraging native performers and composers. It was a result of the general [[Gaels|Gaelic]]ising programme of the [[Gaelic League]]. It consisted of competitions for performance and composition and was supported by all musicians of the day, both traditional and classical. Prizes aggregating £800 were distributed among the successful competitors.

Since those early years, the Feis Ceoil has undergone many changes to accommodate the development of music in Ireland. It has expanded to more than 185 competitions in all instruments, including voice, and covering all ages from 7 years upwards. Famous competitors over the festival's history include tenor [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], author [[James Joyce]] (as a singer), tenor [[Finbar Wright]], broadcaster [[Seán Óg Ó Ceallacháin]], the Irish composer Vincent Kennedy (as a trumpet player) and violinist [[Cora Venus Lunny]].

Performers have included [[Margaret Burke Sheridan]], Suzanne Murphy, [[Bernadette Greevy]], Eithne Robinson, [[Hugh Tinney]], [[Philip Martin (pianist)|Philip Martin]], [[John O'Conor]], John Ronayne, Emma Murphy, Geraldine O'Grady, [[Ann Murray]], [[Mary Hegarty]], [[Cara O'Sullivan]], Celine Byne, Orla Boylan, [[Finghin Collins]], Cora Venus Lunny, [[Tara Erraught]], Joseph Dalton, and Claudia Boyle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6265">'''Gardenasia''' is a Singapore nature-based events company under landscaping and horticulture group Nyee Phoe (NPG). It was co-founded by Kenny Eng and originally set up as the sales arm of Nyee Phoe Flower Garden. &lt;ref name="Source 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erica|first1=T.|title=Breathing new life into great-grandpa's garden.|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes2007071|publisher=The Straits Times|date=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Source 16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Song|first1=A.|title=A triumph of innovation|publisher=The New Paper|date= 8 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three divisions under the NPG are Nyee Phoe Flower Garden, Petals &amp; Leaves and Gardenasia.&lt;ref name="Source 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gardenasia.com/index.php/about-nyee-phoe-group|title=About Nyee Phoe Group.|last1=Gardenasia|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2001,&lt;ref name="Source 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Gardenasia|url=http://gardenasia.com/index.php/xxx1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardenasia was co-founded by Kenny Eng under their parent company, Nyee Phoe Group (NPG).&lt;ref name="Source 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Source 16" /&gt; In its initial years, NPG started out with Nyee Phoe Flower Garden, when Eng's great-grandfather, Eng Hock Lai, left China for Singapore in 1911. Eng Hock Lai started a [[Plant nursery|nursery]] in Singapore as he had a [[horticulture]] background back in his hometown.&lt;ref name="Source 1" /&gt; Under the leadership of Kenny Eng's father and uncle, Nyee Phoe Flower Garden expanded to provide landscaping services in 1968. They also diversified to provide a line of gardening products in the 1970s to 1980s.&lt;ref name="Source 16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Source 15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Business Times|title=SME INC; Sowing the seeds of youth and renewal.|publisher=The Business Times|date= 4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, NPG further diversified their business by launching their creative floral services division, Petal &amp; Leaves.&lt;ref name="Source 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petalsnleaves.com/aboutus.htm|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Nyee Phoe Flower Garden’s government leases were not renewed and they were removed from their sites in Jalan Kayu and Bukit Panjang. Subsequently, they moved to a 2 hectare plot of land along Neo Tiew Crescent.&lt;ref name="Source 1" /&gt; At its new site, the business faced financial difficulties because of its remote location. Kenny Eng and his family kept Nyee Phoe Flower Garden afloat by staging roadshows and worked on landscaping projects recommended by clients.&lt;ref name="Source 1" /&gt; The company eventually diversified to include Gardenasia as the “lifestyle” division of NPG.&lt;ref name="Source 1" /&gt;

==Company Profile==
Gardenasia provides services which include farmstays, an on-site bistro, events management and educational programs. It provides eco-themed workshops and team-building activities. Gardenasia also added corporate team-building workshops in 2009.&lt;ref name="Source 18"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toh|first1=K.|title=Working for fun: Team-building activities get exciting as companies send their staff for things such as bloop soccer or art jamming sessions.|url=http://search.proquest.com/newsstand/docview/1473867198/C2388BFA58994009PQ/2?accountid=12691|publisher=The Straits Times|date=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Projects==
Gardenasia has collaborated with various parties to organise social responsibility projects:

* The Living! Project: [[i Light Marina Bay|iLight Marina Bay]], Singapore (2010 and 2014)
The Living! Project was initiated by Gardenasia’s founder Kenny Eng, Allan Lim, and sculptor Sun Yu-Li. For [[i Light Marina Bay|iLight Marina Bay]] 2010, they conceived the idea for a 5.8m tall stainless steel sculpture called “'In Celebration.” In collaboration with People's Association Singapore, trainers and volunteers created plastic art pieces using plastic bottles and cups to build the sculpture. The sculpture was awarded “Most Popular Artwork” at this event.&lt;ref name="Source 11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gardenasia.com/index.php/social-responsibility-programmes|title=Social Responsibility Programmes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was the first Asian artwork to be showcased at the [[Festival of Lights (Lyon)|Fête des Lumières]](Festival of Lights) in [[Lyon]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="Source 14"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pang|first1=J. H.|title=S'pore sculpture shines at Festival of Lights in France|publisher=The Business Times|date=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, The Living! Project  contributed again at iLight Marina Bay with their installation called “The Wishing! Tree.” &lt;ref name="Source 12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilightmarinabay.sg/installation/the-wishing-tree/|title=The Wishing!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15692">The '''Great Depression in the Netherlands''' occurred between 1933 and 1936,&lt;ref name="Beishuizen"&gt;Beishuizen, Jan, &amp; Werkman, Evert (1967) De Magere Jaren: Nederland in de crisistijd, 1929–1939, 2nd edition. Sijthoff, Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt; significantly later than in most other countries. It was a period of severe [[economic crisis]] in the 1930s which affected countries around the world, including the [[Netherlands]] ({{lang-nl|De Grote Depressie}}, de Crisisjaren, de Crisistijd). 

In the [[United States]], the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] is understood as the start of the Great Depression. But in the Netherlands the [[Recession|depression]] started more gradually, in 1929–1931, while the economy had been in a gradual decline for a longer period. In the Netherlands the depression lasted significantly longer than in most countries, partly because of structural characteristics of the [[Economy of the Netherlands|Dutch economy]] and partly because of the policy of the government. The refusal to drop the [[gold standard]] plays a central role. The Great Depression led to political instability and riots, and can be linked to the rise of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]]. The depression in the Netherlands lessened at the end of 1936, but real economic stability did not return until after [[World War II]].

==Prelude (1918-1929)==
Because of its [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in [[World War I]], the Netherlands did not face the problems of [[war reparations]], war damage and population loss which caused economic problems in other European countries. But because of the international character of the Dutch economy these problems also had their consequences for the Netherlands. Especially the unrest and economic problems in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], one of the Netherlands' main trading partners, in the early 1920s plunged the Netherlands into a severe depression until 1925 (lowest point reached in 1923).&lt;ref name="Beishuizen" /&gt; 

After 1925, partly because of economic improvements in Germany, the post-war depression in the Netherlands ended and the country rejoined the [[gold standard]]. However, among others because of strong [[trade restriction]]s in Germany, this improvement was limited and did not cause an [[economic boom]] as in some other European countries and the United States (associated with the [[Roaring Twenties]]).
In spite of these slight economic improvements the [[Dutch economy]] struggled with structural problems in the period before the [[Great Depression]]. Trade restrictions and economic [[protectionism]] had not fully disappeared after [[World War I]], and world trade failed to pick up again after the war. The Dutch economy had long been dependent on international trade and finance (in 1929 an estimated 30% of the [[GNP]] came from export),&lt;ref name="Beishuizen" /&gt; and especially the big [[shipping]] sector suffered from the lack of trading opportunities. Another problem was the combination of high post-World War I [[birthrate]]s and increasing [[labour productivity]], which meant that any increase of [[demand]] didn’t cause general [[welfare]] increase and a fall of [[unemployment]].

==Poverty and support==
[[File:Stempellokaal Amsterdam 1933.jpg|thumb|A line of unemployed people in Amsterdam, 1933.]]
Until 1931 the social consequences of the economic crisis had been limited; by decreasing work hours and wages mass unemployment had so far been avoided in most sectors. However, around 1931 mass unemployment did start and those workers who could keep their jobs often had to accept significant wage cuts. Rough estimates of unemployment show a surge between 1930 and 1932, and a steady increase up to the end of 1936.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Griffiths, Richard, e.a. (1987) The Netherlands and the Gold Standard, 1931-1936. NEHA, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; Not every sector of the economy suffered equally; while the shipping and trading sectors were hit especially hard, some specialised sectors such as the tobacco industry survived the first stage of the depression relatively unharmed.&lt;ref name="Beishuizen" /&gt;

At the start of the depression employed workers still saw their wage cuts matched by strong decreases of the price of consumption articles. But after the first years of the depression they too suffered from a decrease in [[real income]].&lt;ref name="Beishuizen" /&gt;
For the increasing numbers of unemployed the situation was much worse. Up to the 1930s the Dutch society did not have the experience and infrastructure needed to deal with mass unemployment. In large parts of society it was felt that unemployed people should above all be stimulated to find work, so only income support at subsistence level should be given. Even though finding work had now become impossible for large numbers of people, social sentiments towards the unemployed only changed slowly. 

[[Labour unions]] had funds for temporary income support for newly unemployed workers, to which the government added some [[subsidy]]. So union members were spared real poverty for a limited period. In the later stages of the depression however these union funds became depleted while the government also reduced its subsidy, forcing unions to steadily decrease the time period and amount of support. Non-unionised workers and workers whose union support period had run out depended on a government poverty fund, which supported them up to subsistence level. This minimal income support came with a heavy [[social stigma]], which reflected the values of contemporary society. Support receivers had to report at a government agency twice a day, waiting in the endless lines of unemployed which became a symbol of the depression. They also had to allow government inspectors to visit them at home and investigate their daily life, which quickly became a strongly hated practice among the unemployed. 

Social stigmatisation also took the form of clearly recognisable signs, such as red coloured subsidised clothing and the especially painful sign that a person was exempt from bicycle taxation (to be worn on a bicycle or on one’s clothing).
In addition to scarce government aid there were private initiatives to support the poor. The most important of these organisations was the ''Nationaal Crisis Comité'' (National Crisis Committee), established by Princess [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Juliana]] in 1931. But because of the limited scale of this organisation it was unable to structurally improve the situation.

==Social unrest==
As most other countries the Netherlands experienced significant social unrest during the Great Depression. But except for a number of impressive events this unrest was actually quite limited in scale.
Statistics of labour [[Strike action|strikes]] for example show that during the 1931-1937 period strikes were actually less common in the Netherlands than in the previous years of economic stability from 1925 to 1930. At the height of the Great Depression in the Netherlands the number of strikes was lowest. [4] Another form of protest was rentstriking, the refusal by a [[leasehold estate|tenant]] to pay rent to a [[landlord]]. This form of protest was also quite limited in scale, partly because of harsh government intervention. 

More impressive was the strike or [[mutiny]] in 1933 of the sailors of {{HNLMS|De Zeven Provinciën|1909|2}}, an armored ship of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]]. As earlier in the United Kingdom ([[Invergordon Mutiny]]) the sailors protested a cut of their wages. The mutiny ended when the Dutch army bombed the ship, killing 22 of the sailors and forcing the rest of the crew to surrender. In 1934 another impressive event took place known as the Jordaan riot. A reduction of the already low government unemployment support sparked protest and riots in several cities in the Netherlands, most strongly in the [[Jordaan]] neighbourhood of [[Amsterdam]]. Between 4 July and 9 July the riots and subsequent harsh intervention by police and military police claimed 6 lives and wounded dozens more.

The upheaval of the Great Depression can also be linked to a rise of [[xenophobia]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and the, albeit limited, success of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|National Socialist Movement]] (NSB). Founded in 1931, the NSB gained some popularity during the depression, with a peak of support in terms of its membership in 1936. When the strength of the depression lessened after 1937 support for the NSB fell again.

==Government policy==
[[File:ZieglerColijn.jpg|thumb|[[Hendrikus Colijn|Hendrik Colijn]], Prime Minister during much of the Great Depression.]]
An important difference between the Great Depression in the Netherlands and the situation in most other affected countries was the role of the government. Until the late 1930s the Dutch government, headed from 1933 to 1939 by the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party|Anti-Revolutionary]] statesman [[Hendrikus Colijn|Hendrik Colijn]], could be described as non-interventionist and strongly internationalist. Its economic policy focussed mainly on keeping a balanced budget for government spending and income. While this government policy was typical for contemporary European and American governments, it was applied especially strictly in the Netherlands until the late stages of the depression.

In the first years of the depression government policy limited itself to supporting the most heavily affected sectors of the economy. In 1931 a corn law was issued (Dutch: ''Tarwewet''), which forced importers of foreign corn to add a quantity of more expensive Dutch corn before sale, to promote the troubled Dutch agriculture. Starting in 1932 a series of "crisis laws" was issued to further subsidise the agricultural and shipping sectors, and to enable a measure of government control on import, export and [[capital flows]]. From 1934 onward the Dutch government also experimented with a Labour Fund (Dutch: Werkfonds) to provide [[subsidised]] workplaces for the unemployed, often on large scale public works (comparable with the [[New Deal]] in the United States). 

The scale of these government interventions was however too small to really change the situation.
While government intervention on the economy was very limited, the Dutch government did lower its spending (including income support to the poor and unemployed) and raised taxes to keep its [[Government budget|budget]] balanced. The effect of this was that while poverty increased, government support to the poor decreased. Such a government policy is heavily criticised by the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian school of economics]], which at that time was still in its infancy. Keynesianism stresses that governments should play an active role in promoting public and private [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] during an economic depression, so a balanced government budget should only be aimed at on the long run.

The Dutch government was also very reluctant to intervene in its trade policy. While most [[Developed country|industrialised countries]] strongly increased their [[trade restriction]]s from the early stages of the Great Depression onward, the Dutch government still hoped for international cooperation to solve the economic crisis. Only after the failed [[1933 World Economic Conference]], when it became clear that countries had to solve their economic problems by themselves, did the Netherlands increase its trade barriers to a more significant level. But as described earlier the Netherlands was still unwilling to drop the gold standard, and instead joined an agreement between the last European countries to maintain the gold standard. This subjected the Dutch economy to fierce foreign competition, forcing Dutch firms to strongly cut their costs in order to survive this situation. In the process wages and employment were cut, and the depression deepened. While the economic situation gradually improved in most industrialised countries around 1933-1934, the Great Depression was still getting worse in the Netherlands.

==Gradual recovery==
As in most other affected countries, the end of the Great Depression in the Netherlands was gradual, but in the Netherlands, recovery did not start before 1936, when the country abandoned the [[gold standard]].

==Fall of the gold standard==
By 1933, only a few European states still remained with the gold standard, while among others the United Kingdom and the United States had abandoned it. By cooperating in international negotiation as a "gold bloc" and lowering [[trade restriction]]s among themselves these states tried to survive harsh foreign competition without accepting [[currency devaluation]]. Internal trade failed to solve their problems, however, and by 1935 only [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and the Netherlands remained in this gold bloc. When France finally decided to accept [[devaluation]] in 1936, the Netherlands had no choice but to follow. While the Netherlands had been so reluctant to drop the gold standard, it quickly brought an economic boost after years of decline. In 1936 the Dutch [[stock market]] started climbing again, trade slowly recovered and unemployment stopped growing.&lt;ref name="Beishuizen" /&gt; Finally the country could now profit from the ongoing economic recovery that had been taking place for many of its trading partners.

==Preamble to World War II==
In 1937 the short period of economic recovery in the Netherlands stagnated again when the United States suffered its [[Recession of 1937–38]]. Another reason for stagnation were the rising political tensions caused by Germany's increasingly aggressive behaviour, causing uncertainty and the withdrawal of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] from European economies. At the same time the effects of the depression became less visible as European states started to rearm themselves in the preamble of [[World War II]]. The Netherlands started its rearmament relatively late and imported much of its weaponry, but by 1938 the artificial economic recovery caused by pre-war preparations also had its effects on the Netherlands. 

By 1939, large numbers of formerly unemployed people had been [[Conscription|drafted]] into the army, while rising defence expenditure (the budget tripled between 1936 and 1939)&lt;ref name="Beishuizen" /&gt; artificially revived several sectors of the economy. Right before World War II an event took place which could have been very influential, had it happened earlier. The cabinet led by Hendrik Colijn was succeeded by the [[Dirk Jan de Geer|De Geer]] cabinet, which included two members of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP) for the first time in history. The new cabinet proposed an ambitious strategy to invest large sums of money in public works to finally end the depression. But before this new policy could fully be implemented the Netherlands was dragged into [[World War II]]. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands, and the Dutch economy transformed into a [[war economy]].

'''''Hollywood Steps Out''''' is a 1941 short [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon by [[Warner Bros.]], directed by [[Tex Avery]]. The cartoon features [[caricature]]s by Ben Shenkman of [[Hollywood]] celebrities from the 1930s and early 1940s, including [[Cary Grant]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Greta Garbo]], and [[Groucho Marx]].

==Plot==
A bird's-eye view of [[Los Angeles]] is shown with searchlights moving to a [[conga]] beat. The action takes place in the famed [[Ciro's]] nightclub, where the Hollywood stars are having dinner at $50 (${{Inflation|US|50|1941|r=2}} today) a plate and "easy terms". The first stars seen are [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Don Ameche]], and, at a table behind them, [[Adolphe Menjou]] and [[Norma Shearer]], followed by [[Cary Grant]], seated alone. Grant's first lines reference his films ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'', ''[[The Awful Truth]]'', and ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (originally titled ''[[The Front Page]]''). [[Greta Garbo]] comes along as a [[Cigarette girl (person)|cigarette girl]], and lights a match for Grant on her notoriously large feet. In the next scene, [[Edward G. Robinson]] asks [[Ann Sheridan]], "How's the Oomph girl tonight?" Sheridan, then known as the "Oomph Girl", responds by uttering the word "Oomph" several times.

The camera then tracks past several other tables: [[Warner Bros.]] staffers Henry Binder and [[Leon Schlesinger]] appear as an [[in-joke]], while the soundtrack quotes "[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]"&amp;nbsp;– the theme to the ''Merrie Melodies'' series. A seat is reserved for [[Bette Davis]], as is a large sofa for the corpulent [[Kate Smith]]; finally the cast of [[Blondie (radio)|Blondie]] has been invited, including a [[fire hydrant]] for Daisy the dog. Meanwhile, in the [[cloakroom]], [[Johnny Weissmuller]] checks a coat with [[Paulette Goddard]] that reveals his [[Tarzan]] outfit, with the single addition of a [[tuxedo]] collar and black [[bow tie]]. [[Sally Rand]] (famous for her striptease acts and [[fan dance]]), leaves her trademark feather "fans" behind and leaves presumably naked.

In the next scene, [[James Cagney]] prepares [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[George Raft]] – all known for their "tough guy" roles – for a risky task. They get ready, turn, and start childishly pitching pennies. [[Harpo Marx]] lights matches under Garbo's foot, but in keeping with her subdued acting style, she responds with only a casual "Ouch." Then [[Clark Gable]] (known for chasing women) turns his head around 180 degrees to observe a pretty girl whom he follows offscreen.

[[Master of Ceremonies|Emcee]] [[Bing Crosby]] introduces the evening's entertainment, interrupted frequently by an over-affectionate race horse with an apparently unconscious [[jockey]] (a reference to Crosby's fondness for [[horse racing]]). Crosby presents [[Leopold Stokowski]], who wears a [[snood (headgear)|snood]] as he prepares for what promises to be a serious orchestral performance&amp;mdash; however, the song is "''Ahí, viene la conga''" and he dances to the beat.

The conga inspires [[Dorothy Lamour]] to invite [[James Stewart]] to dance with her. Stewart, known for playing "shy guy" roles, stutters, stammers, and finally runs away scared, leaving behind a sign reading "''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]].''" Gable dances by, following the girl he saw earlier. [[Tyrone Power]] dances with noted [[ice skating|ice skater]] [[Sonja Henie]]. [[Frankenstein's monster]] dances stiffly and woodenly. [[The Three Stooges]] poke and smash each other in rhythm to the beat. [[Oliver Hardy]]'s dance partner is revealed to be two women, initially hidden by his [[Obesity|obese]] frame. [[Cesar Romero]] dances with [[Rita Hayworth]]; considered to be two of the era's best big-screen dancers, they dance clumsily and spastically.

[[Mickey Rooney]], sitting with [[Judy Garland]], is presented with an expensive bill. An episode of the [[Andy Hardy]] film series breaks out as Rooney asks his "father", Judge Hardy ([[Lewis Stone]]), for a favor. In the next scene they are seen washing the dishes to the conga beat.

[[File:Hollywood steps out (28).png|thumb|left|180px|William Powell, Spencer Tracy, Ronald Colman, Errol Flynn, Wallace Beery, and C. Aubrey Smith]]
Gable, still following the girl, gives an aside to the audience: "Don't go away folks, this oughta be good!" Crosby then introduces the "feature attraction of the evening:" Sally Rand (identified as "Sally Strand") performing the [[bubble dance]] to "[[I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles]]". Throughout the dance she holds a large white bubble in front of her presumably nude body. [[Kay Kyser]], in his "Ol' Perfessor" character, shouts out, "Students!" to which a group of men [[wolf-whistle]] in unison and exclaim "Baby!": They are [[William Powell]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Wallace Beery]] and [[C. Aubrey Smith]]. [[Peter Lorre]] cryptically states, "I haven't seen such a beautiful bubble since I was a child," possibly in reference to his breakthrough film role as a child murderer in ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''. [[Henry Fonda]] is enjoying the act until he is pulled away by Alice Aldrich of ''[[The Aldrich Family]]'' saying "Hen-''reeeeee''!" [[J. Edgar Hoover]] then says "Gee!" several times as a pun on his position as a [[G-Man (slang)|G-man]]. [[Boris Karloff]], [[Arthur Treacher]], [[Buster Keaton]], and [[Mischa Auer]] watch the action in their typical [[deadpan]] manner until [[Ned Sparks]], another famous movie "grouch," asks them if they are having a good time; they respond in unison with a terse "Yes." [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] is very excited, and utters his catchphrases "Guess who?", to which the camera reveals an invisible character next to him: "Yehudi!" ("Who's Yehudi?" was Colonna's famous [[catchphrase]], referring to violinist [[Yehudi Menuhin]]).

"Strand" tosses her bubble up in the air and catches it on the way back down, titillating the audience. Finally, Harpo shoots the bubble with a slingshot; Sally reacts with shock as it reveals a barrel underneath. Gable, meanwhile, has finally caught the girl he was chasing, insisting she kiss him. "She" turns out to be [[Groucho Marx]] in drag, and says, "Well, fancy meeting you here!"

==Production notes==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hollywood Steps Out.png|250px|thumb|right|A [[cel]] of several characters from ''Hollywood Steps Out'' was on display as part of a ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' exhibit at the [[Butler Institute of American Art]] in [[Youngstown, Ohio]] in 2008. The Warners were natives of Youngstown.]] --&gt;

* When announced for the bubble dance Rand is called "Strand" by Crosby, presumably to avoid infringement. Rand refused permission to copy her dance act.
* In one showing of the short, there are actually variants as to how the cartoon runs. In some versions, Cary Grant would say "...I'd land it," but in other versions he would say "...I'd land right on the front page." In the latter version, this is also the version where it shows a more revealing, erotic bubble dance by Sally Strand. If one slows the part where she lifts her bubble up, one can see much more of her nudity than is shown in the former case. The bubble also immediately comes down after going up a certain distance rather than to the left first before coming down. In addition, her nudity is never completely shown, but rather is heavily implied. Throughout the entire dance, the viewer can only see her dance from the front side due to the camera view. Her sides and back side are never shown. The short is also in high-quality definition as well in this case.
* Out of the 46 stars caricatured, Mickey Rooney was the last survivor until his death on April 6, 2014.
* Kent Rogers voiced all of the male celebrities except for Jerry Colonna, who was voiced by Mel Blanc. Rogers was a gifted impressionist, and only 17 years old when the cartoon was made. In July 1944, he was killed in [[Pensacola, Florida]], during a U.S. Navy training flight.
* The original release had an extended ending where Clark Gable kisses Groucho Marx anyway (adding, "I'm a BAD boy!"); this was cut out of the reissue print, because Clark was worried it would hurt his career. The result of cutting the ending was an abrupt black-out fade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/strange-version-of-hollywood-steps-out.3535761/|title=Strange version of Hollywood Steps Out|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Caricatures of [[Katharine Hepburn]] and Bette Davis were made, but ultimately not used in the film. Had they made the cut, Hepburn would've been the longest lived of all the stars, being 96 at the time of her death in 2003.
*[[Gary Cooper]] and [[Shirley Temple]] were supposed to have a dance in a deleted scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Trivia/HollywoodStepsOut|title=Hollywood Steps Out / Trivia - TV Tropes|website=TV Tropes|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''international trade in primates''' sees 32,000 wild non-human [[primate]]s (NHPs) trapped and sold on the international market every year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} They are sold mostly for use in [[animal testing]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, but also for food, for exhibition in zoos and circuses, and for private use as [[Pet|companion animals]].

==Countries involved==
The United States imports around one third of all NHPs sold internationally, with the United Kingdom importing the second highest number. Japan, Russia, The Netherlands, France, and Taiwan also rank among the top importing countries.

The NHPs are exported from Indonesia, Malaysia, Kenya, Thailand, Philippines, Mauritius, Amazonian regions across South America, and China, where they exist indigenously.

==How the NHPs are caught and held==
They are caught by local villagers and farmers, who set traps with baited nets and or by laying bait in crates. Entire families may be caught in the nets, with any undesirable NHPs being killed and sold for food.

Those who survive are taken in crates to holding centers, possibly without food or water. The centers are reportedly overcrowded and dirty; the primates may not be able to stand in the crates, and many die. Others are weeded out because they are ill, too thin, or too old, with females and babies being the most desirable.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;Howard, Linda &amp; Jones, Dena. [http://www.bornfreeusa.org/articles.php?p=2174&amp;more=1 "Trafficking in Misery: The Primate Trade"], ''Animal Issues'', Volume 31, Number 3, Fall 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1992 investigation by the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]], 75% of the NHPs may be killed at the holding centers.&lt;ref name=BUAV&gt;[http://www.buav.org/campaigns/primates/inttrade.html "Next of kin"], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal testing==
{{Main|Animal testing on non-human primates}}
NHPs may be imported into the U.S. and sold for "scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes," and for use in breeding colonies. According to the AESOP Project, the majority of NHPs are imported to the U.S. to be used in laboratories.

23,465 non-human primates destined for laboratories or laboratory suppliers were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including [[macaques]], [[grivet]]s and [[capuchin monkey|capuchins]]. The majority of these animals were from China, Mauritius, Cambodia and Vietnam, respectively. [[Covance]], [[Charles River Laboratories]] and SNBL USA are the largest U.S. importers of monkeys destined for laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. primate import statistics for 2014|url=http://www.ippl.org/gibbon/u-s-primate-import-statistics-2014/|website=International Primate Protection League|publisher=26 January 2015|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the United States.&lt;ref name="LEMIS"&gt;Figures from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, LEMIS (Law Enforcement Management Information Service), cited in Howard, Linda &amp; Jones, Dena.

Airlines have been under "significant pressure" from [[PETA]] and other groups to end their transport of monkeys and other animals to laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wadman|first1=Meredith|title=Activists ground primate flights|url=http://www.nature.com/news/activists-ground-primate-flights-1.10255|accessdate=14 July 2015|agency=Nature|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to PETA, over 110 airlines refuse to transport monkeys to laboratories, many after being the target of the animal welfare group’s campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airlines That DO and That DO NOT Ship Primates to Labs|url=http://www.peta.org/action/campaigns/airlines-ship-primates-labs/|website=PETA.org|publisher=PETA|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
As of 2015, [[Air France]] remains the last major airline to still transport nonhuman primates to laboratories. While Air France has defended the practice, saying the use of monkeys in research is needed, others including PETA, [[Jane Goodall]], [[James Cromwell]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] have criticized the airline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meikle|first1=James|title=Jane Goodall and Peter Gabriel urge Air France to stop ferrying lab monkeys|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/may/20/jane-goodall-peter-gabriel-air-france-stop-monkeys-transport|accessdate=14 July 2015|agency=The Guardian|date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet homicide''' refers to a killing in which victim and perpetrator met online, in some cases having known each other previously only through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;''Psychiatric mental health nursing'', Katherine M.

== Serial killers ==

[[Serial killer]]s are murderers who target three or more victims sequentially, with a "cooling off" period between each murder, and whose motivation for killing is largely based on [[abnormal psychology|psychological]] gratification.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes and Holmes, ''Contemporary'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Burkhalter Chmelir |first=Sandra |editor=Robert Kastenbaum |encyclopedia=Macmillan Encyclopedia of Death and Dying |title=Serial Killers |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5214/is_2003/ai_n19132282?tag=content;col1 |year=2003 |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA/Thomson/Gale |volume=2 |location=New York, New York |pages=1 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5b0rm5Zum?url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5214/is_2003/ai_n19132282?tag=content%3Bcol1 |archivedate=2008-09-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such killers have used forms of social networking to attract victims long before the advent of the Internet. For example, between 1900 and 1914, Hungarian serial killer [[Béla Kiss]] lured his 24 victims by using [[personal ads]] published in newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Greig, Charlotte (2005). Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Paul Bocj, the author of ''Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age and How to Protect Your Family'', "The idea that a serial killer may have operated via the Internet is, understandably, one that has resulted in a great deal of public anxiety."&lt;ref name=bocj&gt;''Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age and How to Protect Your Family'' by Paul Bocj, [[Praeger Publishers]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Harold Schecter]]'s ''A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'', the entry for "Internet" reads in part: "If the Internet has become a very useful tool for people interested in serial killers, there's some indication that it may also prove to be a resource for serial killers themselves."&lt;ref name=atoz/&gt; Maurice Godwin, a forensic consultant, argued that "There are some sadistic predators that rely on the Mardi Gras Effect ["the ability to hide one's identity on the Internet"] to lure and murder repeatedly."&lt;ref name="cybermurder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifeloom.com/III1Godwin.htm|title=CyberMurder.com|last=Godwin|first=Maurice|date=Summer 2005|work=Web Mystery Magazine|accessdate=2009-06-10|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103195620/http://lifeloom.com/III1Godwin.htm|archive-date=2013-01-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first serial killer known to have used the Internet to find victims was [[John Edward Robinson (serial killer)|John Edward Robinson]], who was arrested in 2000 and was referred to in ''Law Enforcement News'' as the "USA's first Internet serial killer" and "the nation's first documented serial killer to use the Internet as a means of luring victims."&lt;ref name="len063000"&gt;

=== Chat rooms ===
{{further|Internet suicide}}

Online [[chatrooms]] are sometimes used by killers to meet and bait potential victims.&lt;ref name="napavalley.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dee-morris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing'', Katherine M. Fortinash and Patricia A. Holoday-Worret, 2007 - Page 509, definition: "Internet Homicide: Luring a person from a chat room to an actual meeting. Can turn deadly."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Japanese serial murderer [[Hiroshi Maeue]] is known to have found victims by using online suicide chat rooms.&lt;ref name="Suicidewebsites2005"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/suicide-websites-an-aid-to-murder/2005/08/11/1123353444920.html |title=Suicide websites an aid to murder |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=August 12, 2005 |accessdate=April 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The killer [[Lisa M. Montgomery]] is reported to have met her victim in an online chatroom for [[rat terrier]] lovers called "Ratter Chatter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/12/19/missouri.fetus/index.html |title=Law Center: Couple allegedly showed off kidnapped baby; Dad united with daughter |publisher=[CNN] |date=December 20, 2004 |accessdate=April 27, 2009 |quote=[Montgomery], using a fictitious name, contacted Stinnett on Wednesday through an Internet chat room about looking at rat terriers the Stinnetts sold over the Internet. [...] The Internet chat room "Ratter Chatter," a haven for rat terrier lovers in cyberspace, was overwhelmed with responses from its users, many of whom indicated they knew both the victim and suspect in the case.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online chatrooms are also used, in some cases, to plan consensual homicides.  For example, in 1996, a [[Maryland]] woman, [[Sharon Lopatka]], apparently agreed to be killed by [[torture]] and [[strangulation]] in a conversation with a man in an online chatroom.&lt;ref name="xent.com"&gt;[http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/fall96/0523.html FoRK Archive: Networking With Stranger Was Fatal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/classics/sharon_lopatka/1.html?sect=13 Internet Assisted Suicide: The Story of Sharon Lopata by Rachael Bell, at CrimeLibrary.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050509031520/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/classics/sharon_lopatka/1.html?sect=13 |date=2005-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Frederick Glass pleaded guilty to killing Lopatka and later died in prison while serving his sentence. In a case that might be regarded as a quasi-consensual homicide, "John," a teenage boy from [[Altrincham, England]], allegedly tricked another teenager into killing him using long conversations in an online chatroom. The other teenager, Mark, apparently believed he was being recruited by some female Secret Service agent. The suicide-by-homicide failed and on May 29, 2004 John pleaded guilty to inciting someone to murder him and was sentenced to three years supervision. Mark pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was sentenced to two years supervision. The boys were forbidden to contact each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/29/1085641765286.html |title=Boy used chat room to get himself killed |author=Nigel Bunyan |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=May 30, 2004 |accessdate= April 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, several suspected and convicted perpetrators have met their victims or solicited murder through Craigslist. Of those cases, two were convicted for crimes in the three-month period encompassing February to April 2009 and a further four were accused of crimes during the 13-month span of March 2008 through April 2009.&lt;ref name="nydn040209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="advocate033009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nydn042009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bostonherald041909/&gt; Although, by definition, Craigslist will have been the initial contact point and a killing will have taken place in order for the suspected, accused, or convicted perpetrator to be dubbed a Craigslist killer, the actual motivations of these criminals are varied. The victims' deaths may result from a [[robbery]] or a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] encounter that turned violent. Some of these perpetrators may not have intended to commit murder, but killed their victims during the course of a struggle or to prevent capture. Each case is different.

==Criticism of the concept==

Several legal and technology experts have questioned the idea that there is a phenomenon of Internet killings. A legal theorist pressed for an Internet angle on a murder by a journalist related that "I asked her whether, if I called her up and asked her out on a blind date and murdered her, she would think it was a "telephone-related murder"?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turkle|first=Sherry|title=Technological Visions: The Hopes and Fears that Shape New Technologies|editor=Marita Sturken |editor2=Douglas Thomas |editor3=Sandra Ball-Rokeach|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2004 |page=20|chapter=1: "Spinning" Technology|isbn= 9781592132270|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ppr_Wui4Pd4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA20,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie Harris (lawyer)|Leslie Harris]], CEO of the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] said of the term "Craigslist Killer" that "A great many of the tragic incidents that tangentially involve the Internet have little or nothing to do with the Internet itself. The Craigslist case is the latest example of that phenomenon. Craigslist is an innovative and valuable resource, which frankly, is being unfairly smeared because it is an Internet site."&lt;ref name=huffpost/&gt; The book ''Hypercrime'' argues that "The more one looks, the more these widely circulated instances of 'cyberkilling' appear to vanish into the smoke of a 'cyberspace'."&lt;ref name=hypercrime/&gt; Susan Brenner, a professor of law and technology wrote that "Is it a cybercrime for John to meet Mary on the Internet, correspond with her and use e-mail to lure her to a meeting where he kills her? News stories often describe conduct such as this as a cybercrime, or as 'Internet murder.' But why is this anything other than murder? We do not, for example, refer to killings orchestrated over the telephone as 'tele-murder' or by snail mail as 'mail murder.' It seems that this is not a cybercrime, that it is simply a real-world crime the commission of which happens to involve the use of computer technology," but she conceded that "there may be reasons to treat conduct such as this differently and to construe it as something other than a conventional crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brenner|first=Susan W.|date=Fall 2004|title=Cybercrime Metrics: Old Wine, New Bottles?|journal=Virginia Journal of Law &amp; Technology|publisher=University of Virginia|volume=9|issue=13|url=http://www.vjolt.net/vol9/issue4/v9i4_a13-Brenner.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Internet homicides ==
{{dynamic list}}

The following individuals have been arrested and/or convicted of crimes in which police claimed that Internet services such as chat rooms and Craigslist advertisements were used to contact victims or hire a murderer. Despite sharing a similar method of contacting victims, they apparently have varied motivations. In the list below, the victims' deaths may have been premeditated, especially if the perpetrator is a [[serial killer]], but they may also have resulted from a [[robbery]], [[insurance fraud]], or a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] encounter that turned violent.

* The [[Murder of Ofir Rahum]] was a shooting attack which occurred on 17 January 2001, in which Palestinian militants from the [[Tanzim]] faction of [[Fatah]] killed 16-year-old Israeli high school student Ofir Rahum on the outskirts of [[Ramallah]]. The murder was planned and initiated by a [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] collaborator, 24-year-old Mona Jaud Awana from [[Bir Nabala]]. Awana conducted long private conversations in English with Rahum on the internet via [[ICQ]], during which she masqueraded as a Jewish Israeli girl. Awana managed to gain Rahum's confidence and to get him to meet with her in [[Jerusalem]], supposedly for romantic purposes. When he arrived for the meeting, she drove him through the border control into the Palestinian-controlled territory and towards a secluded area on the outskirts of [[Ramallah]] where Palestinian terrorists shot him at close range, with Awana standing aside and watching.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/01/41300 |title=Israel's 'First Internet Murder' |publisher=Wired |date=19 January 2001 |author=Hershman, Tania |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025113122/http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/01/41300 |archivedate=October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.il/FirstGov/TopNavEng/EngSubjects/SafeSurfingEng/TeenagersEng/SSETSurfSafetly/SSETSTOphirRachum/ The Murder of Ofir Rahum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022111226/http://www.gov.il/FirstGov/TopNavEng/EngSubjects/SafeSurfingEng/TeenagersEng/SSETSurfSafetly/SSETSTOphirRachum/ |date=2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Awana was tried and convicted of murder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2799917,00.html Ynet, ''Hebrew'' 21.10.03]&lt;/ref&gt; she was sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2813523,00.html Ynet, ''Hebrew'' 6.11.03]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ion Perdicaris' father, Gregory Perdicaris, was a Greek who had emigrated to the United States from the northern Greek town of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]], marrying into a wealthy family in [[South Carolina]] and becoming a US citizen. He later returned to Greece as US [[consulate general|consul]]. In 1846 the family moved to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], New Jersey, where Gregory Perdicaris became wealthy as one of the organizers of the Trenton Gas Company. His son Ion lived the life of a [[wikt:dilettante|dilettante]] until the [[American Civil War]]. By 1862, the family's property in South Carolina was in danger of confiscation by the government of the [[Confederate States of America]]. Perdicaris travelled to Greece, intending to [[relinquishment of United States nationality|renounce his United States citizenship]] and acquire Greek nationality to forestall any confiscation.

Perdicaris later moved to [[Tangier]], where he built a house known as the ''Place of Nightingales'' and filled it with exotic animals. In 1871, Perdicaris met Ellen Varley, wife of the eminent telegraph engineer [[C.F. Varley]] in [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], England. Varley was away on a cable-laying expedition and Ellen abandoned him for Perdicaris. The Varleys divorced in 1873 and Ellen settled in Tangier with Perdicaris and her two sons and two daughters. Fascinated by Moroccan culture, Perdicaris wrote several books (few of them published to a wide audience) on Morocco, and became the unofficial head of Tangier's foreign community. He maintained business interests in England and the United States and frequently visited New York.

==Perdicaris incident==
[[File:Editorial cartoon about the Perdicaris Incident.jpg|thumb|right|US newspaper cartoon on the incident]]
On 18 May 1904, Perdicaris and Ellen's son Cromwell were kidnapped from their home by [[Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli]]'s bandits. Several of Perdicaris's servants were injured by Raisuli's men, and Ellen was left behind alone. Shortly after leaving Tangier, Perdicaris broke his leg in a horse fall. Raisuli demanded of [[Sultan]] [[Abdelaziz of Morocco]], $70,000 ransom, safe conduct, and control of two of [[Morocco]]'s wealthiest districts.

Despite the circumstances, Perdicaris came to admire and befriend Raisuli, who pledged to protect his prisoner from any harm. Perdicaris later said: "I go so far as to say that I do not regret having been his prisoner for some time... He is not a bandit, not a murderer, but a patriot forced into acts of brigandage to save his native soil and his people from the yoke of tyranny." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalcentury.com/1904.html "1904: 'Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead!'"], Jon Blackwell, ''The Trentonian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

US president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was angered by the kidnapping, and felt obliged to react. His [[Secretary of State]], [[John Hay]], described the demands as "preposterous". At the urging of Hay and the Consul-General of Tangier, [[Samuel R. Gummere]], Roosevelt dispatched seven warships under the command of Admiral [[French Ensor Chadwick]], and several [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] companies, commanded by [[Major]] [[John Twiggs Myers]], though with little idea of what US forces could achieve on such hostile foreign soil. They were not to be used without express orders from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]; the only plan for using them was to seize the custom-houses of Morocco, which supplied much of its revenue, if the Moroccan government did not fulfill the demands of the United States, which were to make the concessions necessary to persuade Raisuli to release Perdicaris, and to attack Raisuli if Perdicaris were killed anyway. The only Marines actually to land on shore were a small detachment of a dozen men, carrying only [[sidearm]]s, who arrived to protect the Consulate and Mrs. Perdicaris.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Tuchman, "Perdicaris Alive or Raisuli Dead" in ''Practicing History'' (1982); originally published in ''American Heritage'' X, 5 in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt's resolve weakened when he was advised on 1 June that Perdicaris was not a U.S. citizen, that in fact he had forfeited his American passport for a Greek one forty years earlier; but Roosevelt reasoned that, since Raisuli thought Perdicaris was an American citizen, it made little difference. Roosevelt tried to get [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[France]] to join the U.S. in a combined military action to rescue Perdicaris, but the two countries refused and France actually reinforced its garrison in anticipation of an American assault. Instead, the two powers were covertly recruited to put pressure on the Sultan to accept Raisuli's demands, which he agreed to do on 21 June. Hay saw the need to save face so he issued a statement to the [[Republican National Convention]]:

{{quote|This government wants Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.}}

According to all witnesses, the Convention, which had been lukewarm towards Roosevelt up until then, went wild at this remark. One [[Kansas]] delegate exclaimed, "Roosevelt and Hay know what they're doing. Our people like courage. We'll stand for anything those men do." &lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]], ''[[Theodore Rex (book)|Theodore Rex]]'', p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; This famous catchphrase quickly caught on, and helped Roosevelt secure his [[U.S. presidential election, 1904|election in 1904]].

Perdicaris and Varley were met personally by Gummere and Chadwick, who had spent much of the time of their capture with Perdicaris's wife. When Ellen Varley asked for the admiral to provide a doctor for her husband, every medical officer in the American fleet volunteered.

The detailed facts of the incident (especially the fact that Perdicaris was not an American) remained secret until 1933, when historian [[Tyler Dennett]] mentioned it in his biography of John Hay.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara W. Tuchman]], "Perdicaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!". ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', August 1959; later republished in Tuchman's essay compilation ''Practicing History: Selected Essays'' (1984), pp. 104-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalcentury.com/1904.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Perdicaris and his family moved to England shortly after the incident, eventually settling in [[Tunbridge Wells]]. He occasionally returned to Trenton where he maintained business interests. Perdicaris Place, off West State Street, is named for him and his father. Ion Perdicaris died in [[London]] in 1925.

==Popular culture==
"Hostages to Momus", a short fiction story by the American author [[O. Henry]] was inspired by the kidnapping of Ion Perdicaris, who in the story is referred to as "Burdick Harris" ("Bur-dick-Harris" is a play on "Per-dic-aris", as the names rhyme, if pronounced as the author intended), a Greek citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/1818/ "Hostage to Momus" online]&lt;/ref&gt; The humorous story was written shortly after the incident.

In 1924, British author and adventurer [[Rosita Forbes]] published ''The Sultan of the Mountains: The Life Story of the Raisuli'', a full-length biography of Raisuli; the book is currently out of print in English,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OLGU5S Amazon.com page on Forbes' book]&lt;/ref&gt; but a Spanish translation has appeared recently.&lt;ref&gt;'El Raisuni, sultán de las montañas', Editorial Almuzara (2010), {{ISBN|978-84-92924-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other books have discussed the incident, including David S. Woolman's ''Rebels in the Rif'', [[Michael B. Oren]]'s ''Power, Faith and Fantasy: America in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present'' and Bill Fawcett's ''Oval Office Oddities'', and a lengthy, in-depth chapter on the kidnapping and President Roosevelt's reaction is included in [[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]]'s second Roosevelt biography, ''[[Theodore Rex (book)|Theodore Rex]]''.

The story of Ion Perdicaris's kidnapping was loosely adapted to film in the 1975 [[motion picture]] ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'', with [[Sean Connery]] in the role of Raisuli and [[Brian Keith]] as Roosevelt. However, to add some spurious glamour to the tale, the 64-year-old bearded hostage was replaced with attractive young "Eden Pedecaris", played by [[Candice Bergen]]. The film incorrectly showed US Marines invading Morocco and battling soldiers of the [[German Empire]] (who were not present in Morocco at the time), but it succeeded in presenting the personality of Raisuli and his interaction with his prisoners.

The '''Line of Contact''' marked the farthest advance of Canadian, American, British and Soviet Armies into German controlled territory at the [[End of World War II in Europe]]. (In general "Line of Contact" refers to the demarcation between any two armies, or more, and this contact can be between belligerent or between allied armies.)

[[File:Final Operations - 19 April-7 May 1945.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Final positions of the Western Allied and Soviet armies, May 8, 1945. Areas not yet occupied also indicated ]]
[[File:Germany occupation zones with border.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Areas vacated by U.S. forces to Soviet forces in summer 1945 shown in lilac, not including the areas of Mecklenburg already ceded by US/British forces to Soviet control earlier]]
This contact began with the first meeting between Soviet and American forces at [[Torgau]], near the [[Elbe]] river on [[Elbe Day]], April 25, 1945. The line continued to form as American, British and Soviet forces took control of, or defeated, Nazi forces, up until the time of the May 8 unconditional surrender of Germany and beyond. This '''line of contact''' did not conform to the agreed-upon occupation zones, as stipulated in the [[Yalta Conference]]. Rather, it was simply the place where the two armies met each other. The Canadian, American and British forces had actually gone far beyond the Yalta agreement boundaries, in some cases up to two hundred miles past, going deep into the [[States of Germany|states]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Saxony]], as well as [[Brandenburg]]. The capital of Mecklenburg, the city of [[Schwerin]], was captured on May 2, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The city of [[Leipzig]], in Saxony, was probably the largest of the cities captured by the Americans that were inside the areas to be later [[Soviet occupation zone|passed to the Soviets]]. The land of Thuringia was completely occupied by American forces. The completed line of contact between Canadian/US/British forces and Soviet forces began at [[Wismar]] on the Baltic coast and proceeded south, passing along Schwerin; [[Magdeburg]]; an area east of Leipzig; and on to the Czech town of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]]; and towards [[Linz]] in Austria.

U.S. forces generally held onto these gains within Germany until July 1945, when under orders from President [[Harry S. Truman]], and against the advice of British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] the U.S. forces withdrew to the Yalta agreement boundaries dividing Germany into occupation zones. It is worth noting that the Soviet Union may not have allowed American and British forces into Berlin, which was completely under their control, if the U.S. had not honored the Yalta agreement boundaries. The German areas relinquished by American troops became part of the Soviet-dominated East Germany.

The US Army did not withdraw from western Czechoslovakia until December 1945, as part of an agreement removing all American and Soviet troops from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Along with a created French zone, Austria remained technically an occupied country by the Four Powers until 1955, when all foreign troops departed. Austria managed to stay free of Soviet domination, whereas Czechoslovakia did not.

'''"Louisiana 1927"''' is a 1974 song written and recorded by [[Randy Newman]] on the album ''[[Good Old Boys (Randy Newman album)|Good Old Boys]]''.  It tells the story of the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] which left 700,000 people homeless in [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]].

==Lyrics==
Sung from the perspective of a nameless resident of the area recounting the flooding of [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]] and [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines parishes]] during the flood, "Louisiana 1927" features lyrics that depict the devastation of the residents of those parishes in the aftermath of the flood.  In particular, the narrator lays out the widespread nature of the destruction ("river had busted through clear down to Plaquemines") and the volume of water the flood produced ("six feet of water in the streets of Evangeline").  Also touched upon is the callous response of the federal government, depicted here via a fictional visit from [[Calvin Coolidge|President Calvin Coolidge]] and "a little fat man," where Coolidge's reaction to the devastation is a detached statement that, "isn't it a shame what the river has done to this poor [[Cracker (pejorative)|cracker's]] land."

==Music==
The song is written in the style of a [[lament]], and is performed at a slow tempo.  Newman's version starts out with piano solo, but builds into including a whole orchestra.

==Hurricane Katrina==
The song became identified with [[Hurricane Katrina]] in the public consciousness after being sung by [[Aaron Neville]] at [[NBC]]'s "[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]", being sung by Newman at the multi-network television fundraiser ''[[Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast]],'' and a fully orchestrated version of the song performed by Newman during ''[[Saturday Night Live|Saturday Night Live's]]'' "[[Saturday Night Live (Season 2)|Mardi Gras Special]]". A new recording of the orchestrated version is included on the Katrina charity album, ''Our New Orleans,'' on [[Nonesuch Records]]. In 2007, the song was covered by [[Ray Stevens]] on his tribute album to New Orleans and Louisiana culture, ''New Orleans Moon''. New Orleans-based singer/pianist [[Marcia Ball]] also covered the song at several Katrina benefit concerts. The song also appeared in an episode (S03E7) of [[HBO]]'s show ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'', sung again by [[Aaron Neville]].

{{Monarchism|Concepts}}

'''Lèse-majesté''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɛ|z|ˌ|m|æ|ʒ|ɛ|s|ˈ|t|eɪ}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lese-majeste ''Collin's English Dicitonary'']&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|i:|z|_|ˈ|m|æ|dʒ|ᵻ|s|t|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|lese-majesty}}&lt;/ref&gt; also '''lese-majesty''', '''lese majesty''' or '''leze majesty''') is the crime of violating [[majesty]], an offence against the dignity of a reigning [[monarch|sovereign]] or against a state.

This behaviour was first classified as a criminal offence against the dignity of the [[Roman Republic]] of [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5PwrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA735&amp;lpg=PA735&amp;dq=laesa+maiestas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1sprtKMss5&amp;sig=h8EYzeDMApaifbzOgjbwEoiGRlc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wRFXVenrJ4WDsAXCioGwBg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=laesa%20maiestas&amp;f=false Oxford Concise Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities] A complex development as distinct from treason occurred from kingdom thru empire. Arguably there was no distinction in the republican period.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Dominate]], or Late Empire period, the [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] eliminated the Republican trappings of their predecessors and began to identify the state with their person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/lese+majesty TheFreeDictionary.com], "Lese majesty" [[TheFreeDictionary.com]], [[Columbia Encyclopedia]], retrieved 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although legally the ''[[princeps civitatis]]'' (his official title, meaning, roughly, 'first citizen') could never become a sovereign because  the republic was never officially abolished, emperors were deified as [[apotheosis|divus]], first posthumously but by the Dominate period while reigning. Deified emperors enjoyed the same legal protection that was accorded to the divinities of the [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|state cult]]; by the time it was replaced by Christianity, what was in all but name a monarchical tradition had already become well-established.

Narrower conceptions of offences against Majesty as offences against the crown predominated in the European kingdoms that emerged in the early medieval period. In [[Feudalism|feudal]] Europe, some crimes were classified as lèse-majesté even if they were not intentionally directed against the crown. An example is counterfeiting, so classified because coins bore the monarch's effigy and/or coat of arms.

With the disappearance of [[absolute monarchy]] in Europe, lèse-majesté came to be viewed as less of a crime. However, certain malicious acts that would have once been classified as the crime of lèse-majesté could still be prosecuted as [[treason]]. Future republics that emerged as great powers generally still classified as a crime any offence against the highest representatives of the state. These laws are still applied as well in monarchies outside of Europe, such as modern [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]].

In that announcement, Merkel also stated the intention to consider repeal of the little-known law.&lt;ref&gt; [https://theintercept.com/2016/04/15/germany-repeal-dumb-law-first-using-prosecute-comic-insulting-erdogan/ TheIntercept.com] "German Chancellor Refuses to Block Prosecution of Comic Who Insulted Turkey’s President" retrieved July 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution was dropped in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/berlin-abolishing-slander-law-on-insulting-foreign-leaders/a-37268893 Deutsche Welle]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
In [[Denmark]], the monarch is protected by the usual [[libel]] paragraph (§ 267 of the [[Danish penalty law|penal code]] which allows for up to four months of imprisonment), but §115&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=113401|title=Resinformation.dk|work=retsinformation.dk|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows for doubling of the usual punishment when the regent is target of the libel. When a [[queen consort]], [[queen dowager]] or the crown prince is the target, the punishment may be increased by 50%. There are no historical records of §115 having ever been used, but in March 2011, [[Greenpeace]] activists who unfurled a banner at a dinner at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] were charged under this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=COP-15 activists in lèse majesté case|newspaper=[[Politiken]]|url=http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ECE1209764/cop-15-activists-in-lse-majest-case/|date=1 March 2011|accessdate=1 March 2011|location=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received minor sentences for other crimes, but were acquitted of the charge relating to the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Københavns Byret (22-08-2011).

Moroccans are routinely prosecuted for statements deemed offensive to the King.

{{main article|Lèse majesté in Thailand}}
[[Thailand]]'s [[Law of Thailand|criminal code]] has carried a prohibition against lèse-majesté since 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6547413.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Thailand's king pardons Swiss man|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, when [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thailand's monarchy]] ceased to be absolute and a [[Constitution of Thailand|constitution]] was adopted, it too included language prohibiting lèse-majesté. The [[Thai constitutional referendum, 2016|2016 Constitution of Thailand]], and all previous versions since 1932, contain the clause, "The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated. No person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action." Thai criminal code elaborates in Article 112: "Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years." Missing from the code, however, is a definition of what actions constitute "defamation" or "insult".&lt;ref name="BBC_JHead"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Head|first1=Jonathan|title=Writer held for 'insulting' Thai royals|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7604935.stm|accessdate=26 October 2016|work=BBC|date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 2005, the Thai court system only saw four or five lèse-majesté cases a year. From January 2006 to May 2011, however, more than 400 cases came to trial, an estimated 15 times increase.&lt;ref name="increase"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110527/ap_on_re_as/as_thailand_monarchy |title=Thailand arrests American for alleged king insult |author=Todd Pitman and Sinfah Tunsarawuth |date=27 March 2011 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers attribute the increase to increased polarization following the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|2006 military coup]] and sensitivity over the elderly king's declining health.&lt;ref name="increase"/&gt; In 2013, the [[Supreme Court of Thailand]] ruled in case no. 6374/2556 that Article 112 of the Penal Code protects the past kings as well as the present one. Criticisms or comments which tarnish past kings or the monarchy is punishable by law. However, scholars raised doubts as to how far back lèse-majesté will be applied as the present Thai monarchy ([[Chakri Dynasty]]) dates back more than 200 years while other monarchies which ruled Siam can be traced back almost 800 years.

Neither the king nor any member of the royal family has ever personally filed any charges under this law. In fact, during his birthday speech in 2005, King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] encouraged criticism: "Actually, I must also be criticized. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know." He later added, "But the King ''can'' do wrong", in reference to those he was appealing to not to overlook his human nature.&lt;ref name="wrong"&gt;{{cite web |date=5 December 2005 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/12/05/headlines/data/headlines_19334288.html|title=Royal Birthday Address: 'King Can Do Wrong'|publisher=National Media|accessdate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the NCPO junta which [[2014 Thai coup d'état|overthrew the democratic regime in May 2014]], charges of lèse-majesté have increased significantly, especially against the opponents of the junta. Lèse-majesté is now seeing increasing use as a tool to stifle free speech and dissent in the country.&lt;ref name="Mother of Dissident"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Thai cleaning lady facing prison for 'I see'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36328865|accessdate=21 May 2016|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the parents of the former princess Srirasmi Suwadee as well as her uncle have been charged with lèse-majesté.

On June 2017 the [[United Nations]] has called on Thailand to amend its law on lèse-majesté.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40298570#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former laws==

===Japan===
Laws against offending the emperor were in place between 1880 and 1947, when the law was abolished, during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Occupation of Japan|occupation]]. The last person to be convicted of the crime was Shōtarō Matsushima, a factory worker and member of the [[Japanese Communist Party]]. During a 1946 protest against food shortages in front of the Imperial Palace, during which the protesters demanded entry into the palace kitchens which were said to be stocked with staple foods, Matsushima wielded a placard reading, on the one side, "Imperial Edict: The Emperor system has been preserved. I, the Emperor, have eaten to my heart's content, but you, my subjects, should starve to death! Signed, (Imperial Seal)". The other side demanded that the Emperor give a public accounting of the food shortages. Matsushima was arrested and charged with impairing the dignity of the Emperor. The Allied occupation authorities intervened and had the charges reduced to libel. Matsushima was convicted and sentenced to eight months in prison, but was pardoned immediately under an Imperial amnesty commemorating the new Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;p. 242, Eiji Takemae: The Allied Occupation of Japan (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Lèse majesté in Norway}}

Following the [[Penal Code (Norway)|2005 Penal Code]] (introduced in 2015), lèse majesté is no longer considered a criminal offense.

The 1902 Penal Code, article 101, provided a fine or up to five years of prison for lèse majesté.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-013.html#101 Straffeloven, § 101] at ''Lovdata.no''&lt;/ref&gt; According to article 103, prosecution had to be ordered or accepted by the King.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19020522-010-013.html#103 Straffeloven, § 103] at ''Lovdata.no''&lt;/ref&gt; Article 101 stated: "If any defamation is exercised against the King or the Regent, the guilty is punished with a fine or up to five years of prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-no|Forøves nogen Ærekrenkelse mod Kongen eller Regenten, straffes den skyldige med Hefte eller Fængsel indtil 5 Aar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 abolished the common law criminal offences of [[sedition]] and "leasing-making". The latter offence, also known as "lease {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|z}} making", was considered an offence of lèse-majesté or making remarks critical of the [[monarch of the United Kingdom]].  The final prosecution for this offence had occurred in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=5495&amp;mode=html|title=Justice Committee Official Report|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Mansur Makan ibn Kaki''' (died 25 December 940) was a [[Daylamite]] military leader active in northern [[Iran]] (esp. [[Tabaristan]] and western [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]) in the early 10th century. He became involved in the succession disputes of the [[Alids of Tabaristan, Daylam and Gilan|Alids of Tabaristan]], and managed to establish himself as the ruler of Tabaristan and [[Gurgan]] for short periods of time, in competition to other Daylamite warlords such as [[Asfar ibn Shiruya]] or the [[Ziyarid]] brothers [[Mardavij]] and [[Vushmgir]]. He alternately opposed and secured support from the [[Samanid]] governors of Khurasan, and eventually fell in battle against a Samanid army.

==Biography==
Like his father, Makan served as an officer in the army of the [[Alids of Tabaristan, Daylam and Gilan|Alids of Tabaristan]],&lt;ref name="EI2-164"&gt;Nazim (1987), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Zaydi]] branch of the [[Alids]] that had established an independent [[emirate]] in [[Tabaristan]], on the southern shore of the [[Caspian Sea]], which periodically included some neighbouring regions ([[Daylam]], [[Gilan]] and [[Gurgan]]) as well.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Madelung (1975), pp. 206–212&lt;/ref&gt; Makan had established family ties through marriage with the Alids, as [[Ja'far ibn al-Nasir|Ja'far]], the son of [[imam]] [[Hasan ibn Ali al-Utrush]] (r. 914–917), was his son-in-law.&lt;ref name="EI2-164"/&gt; The latter was engaged in a complex struggle against al-Utrush's designated successor [[Abu Muhammad Hasan ibn Qasim]] (r. 917–928), known as the ''[[Da'i]] ila'l-Haqq'' ("Missionary of the True Faith"), and it was not until 923 that Ja'far and his brother [[Ahmad ibn al-Nasir|Ahmad]] succeeded in ousting the ''Da'i'' and forcing him to exile.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1975), pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; Makan was then appointed governor of Gurgan, the easternmost province of the Alid emirate. When Ja'far died in 924, he left the throne to Ahmad's son [[Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn al-Nasir|Abu Ali Muhammad]], but Makan deposed Muhammad and installed his own grand-nephew [[Ismail ibn Ja'far ibn al-Nasir|Ismail]], a son of Ja'far, in his place.&lt;ref name="EI2-164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iran211"&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad, however, managed to escape from his captors and with the aid of the Daylamite military chief [[Asfar ibn Shiruya]], who had seized control of Gurgan, defeated Makan and retook his throne.&lt;ref name="EI2-164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iran211"/&gt;

[[File:Carte Iran 1000.png|thumb|right|250px|Persia in the mid-10th century]]
Makan escaped the defeat and found refuge in a remote fortress in the mountainous region of [[Sari, Iran|Sari]]. There he remained until Muhammad's death in 926/927, when he issued forth, defeated the Alid army and deposed Muhammad's brother [[Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn al-Nasir|Abu Ja'far Husayn]], forcing him to flee to [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. Makan did not claim the emirate for himself, but recalled the ''Da'i'' from exile.&lt;ref name="EI2-164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iran211"/&gt; In 928, Makan and the ''Da'i'' took over the province of [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]] at the invitation of its [[Samanid]] governor, and advanced into [[Jibal]] as far as [[Qum]]. Asfar, however, who now governed Gurgan as a Samanid vassal, used the opportunity of their absence to return to Tabaristan and conquer it for himself. The ''Da'i'' returned to oppose Asfar, but was mortally wounded before his capital, [[Amol|Amul]]. Next, Asfar marched on Rayy, where he defeated Makan, who fled to Daylam.&lt;ref name="EI2-164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iran211"/&gt;

Abu Ja'far Husayn was initially re-installed as imam, but was soon removed to the Samanid capital, [[Bukhara]]. The Samanid interlude proved brief, as in 930, Makan managed to recover Tabaristan, extend his control over most of Gurgan and even take possession of [[Nishapur]] in western Khurasan, which he was forced to abandon in 931, bowing to pressure by the Samanid ruler [[Nasr II]].&lt;ref name="EI2-164"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1975), pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; Makan also had to face a rebellion at home, where his relative [[al-Hasan ibn al-Fairuzan]], who governed Tabaristan in his absence, tried to re-install his half-brother Ismail as imam. The revolt failed after Ismail was poisoned at the instigation of Abu Ja'far Husayn's mother.&lt;ref name="Iran212"&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Asfar had lost power in Rayy to the rebellion of his former subordinate, [[Mardavij]], and fled to [[Quhistan]], where he died soon after. Abu Ja'far Husayn, who had managed to escape Samanid captivity, sought Mardavij's aid in recovering his position. Mardavij lent him an army, but Makan defeated Mardavij's forces in a first engagement in 931. Eventually, after Makan's return to Tabaristan from Nishapur, Mardavij launched an attack that conquered Tabaristan.&lt;ref name="EI2-164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iran212"/&gt;

Makan tried to reclaim his domain with aid from Gilan and Khurasan, but failed. He then sought refuge among the Samanids in Khurasan, where Nasr appointed him governor of [[Kirman]]. Makan defeated the incumbent governor and took possession of the province, which he governed until 935, when he learned of Mardavij's assassination at the hands of his own Turkish ''[[ghilman]]''.&lt;ref name="EI2-164"/&gt; Immediately he left Kirman, secured his appointment as governor of Gurgan (which Mardavij had ceded to the Samanids in exchange for peace in 933) from Nasr, and with the support of Samanid troops tried to recover Tabaristan. [[Vushmgir]], the brother and heir of Mardavij, managed to repel the attack and even conquer Gurgan, but [[Buyid]] pressure on his western flank forced him to reach a settlement, recognizing Samanid overlordship and ceding Gurgan to Makan.&lt;ref&gt;Nazim (1987), pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iran213"&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Makan and Vushmgir improved to the point where the former felt secure enough to drop his dependence on the Samanids. As a result, in 939 a Samanid army under Abu Ali ibn Muhtaj attacked him at Gurgan. Following a seven-month siege of his capital, Makan was forced to flee to Rayy. The Samanid army pursued him, and in a battle fought on 25 December 940 at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]] near Rayy, the Samanid forces were victorious. Makan himself was killed by an arrow, and then beheaded by the victors, who sent his head to Nasr in [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name="Iran213"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nazim (1987), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Munich Biennale''' ({{lang-de|'''Münchener Biennale'''}}) is an [[opera festival]] in the city of [[Munich]]. The full German name is ''Internationales Festival für neues Musiktheater'', literally: International Festival for New Music Theater. The biennial festival was created in 1988 by [[Hans Werner Henze]] and is held in even-numbered years over 2&amp;ndash;3 weeks in the late spring. The festival concentrates on world premieres of theater-related [[contemporary music]], with a particular focus on commissioning first operas from young composers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evs-musikstiftung.ch/en/grants-in-aid/grants-in-aid-archive/2010/festivals/ Munich Biennale Concert Series: Biennale plus] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730192251/http://www.evs-musikstiftung.ch/en/grants-in-aid/grants-in-aid-archive/2010/festivals/ |date=30 July 2012 }} Ernst von Siemens music foundation 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?ei=Ip-PTYrTKc34sgbW4sSHCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=Ze8YAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Munich+Biennale++Hans+Werner+Henze&amp;q=Hans+Werner+Henze+1988+#search_anchor | title =Hans Werner Henze: Komponist der Gegenwart | page = 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first four festivals, under Henze==
Henze, himself a prolific composer of operas, described the genesis of the festival like this: 
{{quote|The whole story started with a query from the departmental head of the (Munich) cultural office ... whether I ... would be interested in considering creating some sort of civic music festival in Munich. After a period of time I suggested organizing something that had been lacking up until that point, something that also did not exist anywhere else in the world and yet was an urgent necessity &amp;ndash; namely, a place where the young generation of composers interested in theatre ... could realize their ideas.&lt;ref name="centre-The whole"&gt;{{cite web

}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Henze curated the first four festivals, from 1988 to 1994, and established the general format of most of the festivals that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Official website, [http://www.muenchenerbiennale.de/standard/en/archive/1988/ archive notes to first biennale, 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905001606/http://www.muenchenerbiennale.de/standard/en/archive/1988/ |date=5 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short runs of the premiered operas are preceded by talks and additional concerts from the featured composers, to introduce the audiences to their ideas and music.&lt;ref&gt;Official website, [http://www.muenchener-biennale.de/klangspuren/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=_06 Klangspuren (discussion concerts) archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401095459/http://www.muenchener-biennale.de/klangspuren/index.php?lang=en |date=1 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The later festivals, under Peter Ruzicka==
[[Peter Ruzicka]] took over as artistic director ("one of the most influential administrative/ artistic positions in the European music-theatre scene")&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, Desi, p.&amp;nbsp;164&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996, with that year's biennale being jointly curated by Henze.  Ruzicka broadened the scope of the works presented, with more emphasis on works using multimedia, and moving away from the text-based sources that characterised the period curated by Henze.&lt;ref&gt;Official website, [http://www.muenchenerbiennale.de/standard/en/archive/1996/ archive notes to fifth biennale, 1996]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Munich Biennale has provided first or early commissions for stage works from many composers now established as opera composers, such as [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]], [[Detlev Glanert]], [[Gerd Kühr]], [[Hans-Jürgen von Bose]], [[Param Vir]], [[Toshio Hosokawa]] and [[Violeta Dinescu]].

The strongly international scope of the festival has meant that it has been able to offer opportunities missing at a national level.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, Desi; p.222: ".. with one or two notable exceptions, the lively London theatre and music scene has not developed a strong creative music-theatre component. The result is that the Munich Biennale and the film industry have sometimes been better patrons for new British opera and music theatre than local musical institutions".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selena|Selena Quintanilla-Pérez]] was an American singer who achieved international fame as a member of [[Selena y Los Dinos]] and for her subsequent solo career in both Spanish and English.{{refn|group=nb|Selena's career began as lead vocalist of [[Selena y Los Dinos|Los Dinos]] in 1980. Nine years later she signed with [[EMI Latin]] as a solo artist and continued to tour with her band.&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hewitt|first1=Bill|title=Before Her Time|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=April 17, 1995|volume=43|issue=15|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105524,00.html|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Her father and manager, [[Abraham Quintanilla Jr.]], appointed [[Yolanda Saldívar]] president of Selena's fan club in 1991 after Saldívar had repeatedly asked permission to start one. In January 1994, Saldívar was promoted to manager of the singer's [[Selena Etc.|boutiques]]. Selena's employees, fashion designer, and cousin began complaining about Saldívar's management style. In January 1995, Quintanilla, Jr. began receiving telephone calls and letters from angry fans who had sent membership payments and had received nothing in return. He began investigating their complaints and found evidence that Saldívar had embezzled $60,000 from the fan club and the boutiques using forged checks. After the Quintanilla family confronted her, Saldívar bought a gun, lured Selena to a motel room, and shot her in the back. Although doctors tried to revive Selena, she was pronounced dead from [[Bleeding|loss of blood]] and [[cardiac arrest]].

The [[Latino|Latino community]] was deeply affected by the news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of [[Murder of John Lennon|John Lennon]], [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Kurt Cobain]], and [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]]. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both the media and the Latino community. Radio personality [[Howard Stern]] mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among the Latino population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-[[Texas governor]] [[George W. Bush]] declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with [[Easter]].

At the time of Selena's death, [[Tejano music]] was one of the most popular [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music subgenres]] in the United States. She was called the "Queen of Tejano music" and became the first Latino artist to have a predominantly Spanish-language album—''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' (1995)—debut and peak at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. After her death, the popularity of Tejano music waned. During [[Trial of Yolanda Saldívar|Saldívar's trial for the murder]]—called the "[[trial of the century]]" and the most important trial for the Latino population—Saldívar said she accidentally shot Selena while attempting suicide. Saldívar was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to [[Life in prison|life imprisonment]]. [[Jennifer Lopez]] was cast as Selena in a [[Selena (film)|1997 biopic film]] about her life and achieved fame after the film's release.

== Background ==

=== The Selena fan club ===
Selena was born on April 16, 1971, in [[Lake Jackson, Texas]], to [[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]], a former musician, and Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla (née Samora).&lt;ref name=biographyselena&gt;{{cite web|title=Selena, the Queen of Tejano Music|url=http://www.legacy.com/ns/news-story.aspx?t=selena-the-queen-of-tejano-music&amp;id=312|publisher=[[Legacy.com]]|accessdate=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selena was introduced to the music industry by her father, who saw "a way back into the music business" after discovering Selena's "perfect timing and pitch".&lt;ref name=people/&gt; He quickly organized his children into a band called [[Selena y Los Dinos]], which included [[A.B. Quintanilla III]] on bass, [[Suzette Quintanilla]] on drums, and Selena as the lead singer.&lt;ref name=people/&gt; The band became the family's main source of income after they were evicted from their home during the [[1980s oil glut|Texas oil bust of 1982]].&lt;ref name=people/&gt; They filed for bankruptcy after Quintanilla, Jr.'s Mexican restaurant suffered as a result of the oil bust. The family moved to [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], and Selena y Los Dinos began recording music professionally.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; In 1984, the band released its first [[LP record]], ''Selena y Los Dinos'', with a small, independent record company.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schone|first=Mark|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2004-10-31/sweet-music|title=Sweet music|newspaper=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=October 31, 2004|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quintanilla, Jr. wanted his children to record [[Tejano music]]—a male-dominated music genre popularized by Mexican Americans in the United States.{{sfn|Miguel|2002|p=118}}&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{Cite episode |series=Latin Music USA |network=[[PBS]] |minutes=30 |quote=Selena wanted to sing American pop music, but her father had learned some hard lessons playing music in Texas with a band he'd had years before called Los Dinos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selena's popularity as a singer grew after she won the [[Tejano Music Awards|Tejano Music Award]] for [[Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of The Year|Female Vocalist of the Year]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morales|first1=Tatiana|title=Fans, family remember Selena|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fans-family-remember-selena/|accessdate=January 29, 2015|work=[[CBS News]]|date=October 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; She landed her first major record deal with [[EMI Latin|Capitol EMI Latin]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="Stephen Finfer"&gt;{{cite news |title=A crossover dream halted prematurely, tragically: Some ambitious plans were under way to bring Selena to mainstream U.S. audience |first=Enrique |last=Lopetegui |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/22779753.html?dids=22779753:22779753&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+08%2C+1995&amp;author=ENRIQUE+LOPETEGUI&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=A+Crossover+Dream+Halted+Prematurely%2C+Tragically+Some+Ambitious+Plans+Were+Under+Way+to+Bring+Selena+to+Mainstream+U.S.+Audience&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Austin Beutner]] |date=April 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yolanda Saldívar]] became a fan of Tejano music in the mid-1980s.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=72}}{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=110}} She originally disliked Selena because Selena had won awards that Saldívar's favorite Tejano musicians were nominated in.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=111}} In mid-1991, Saldívar attended one of Selena's concerts in [[San Antonio, Texas]] with her niece.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=72}} She became an ardent Selena fan; she particularly enjoyed the singer's stage presence{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=72}} and especially liked the song "[[Baila Esta Cumbia]]".{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=111}} The day after the concert, Saldívar unsuccessfully searched news stands for a souvenir of the event.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=72}} She got the idea of starting a Selena fan club in the San Antonio area to promote the singer.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=72}} According to Quintanilla, Jr., Saldívar tried contacting him and left him fifteen messages; she said she left only three.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=72}} Quintanilla, Jr. contacted her to discuss her idea of starting a fan club.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=72}} After meeting with Saldívar, he approved of her idea and gave her permission to proceed.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=72}}

Saldívar became the founder and acting president of the Selena fan club in San Antonio in June 1991. As president, she was responsible for membership benefits and collecting $22 in exchange for products promoting Selena,{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=73}} a T-shirt bearing the singer's name, exclusive interviews with the band, a fact sheet about Selena y Los Dinos, and notifications of upcoming concerts.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=111}} Proceeds from the fan club were donated to charities.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=73}} Suzette was the contact person between Saldívar and the Quintanilla family; Saldívar did not meet Selena until December 1991.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=73}} The two became close friends and the Quintanilla family trusted her.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=111}}{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=77}} By 1994, Saldívar had signed up more than 8,000 fans.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=73}} According to television news reporter and anchorwoman [[María Celeste Arrarás]], Saldívar had become the "most efficient assistant" the singer ever had.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=74}} Arrarás wrote that people noticed how eager Saldívar was to impress Selena, and did anything the singer told her to do. One person told Arrarás, "if Selena would say, 'Jump!', [Saldívar] would jump three times".{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=74}} Saldívar gave up her career as an in-home nurse for patients with terminal cancer and respiratory diseases.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|pp=71, 75}} She decided to fully invest her time in running the Selena fan club, although she was earning less than she had as a nurse.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=75}}

=== Selena Etc. boutiques ===
In 1994, Selena opened two boutiques called [[Selena Etc.]] in Corpus Christi and San Antonio; they were equipped with in-house beauty salons. Quintanilla, Jr. thought Saldívar was a potential candidate to run the businesses because the family would be touring the country.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=77}} He believed she was the best choice because of her success running the fan club. The family agreed; in January 1994, Saldívar became the manager of the boutiques. In September 1994, Selena signed Saldívar as her [[registered agent]] in San Antonio.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=146}} After being hired to run the boutiques, Saldívar moved from [[Neighborhoods of San Antonio|South San Antonio]] to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena. In an interview with ''[[Primer Impacto]]'' in 1995, Quintanilla, Jr. said he "always mistrusted Saldívar", though the family never found anything odd about Saldívar's behavior.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=77}} Saldívar was authorized to write and cash checks, and had access to bank accounts associated with the fan club and boutiques.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=79}}

Selena gave Saldívar her [[American Express]] card for the purpose of conducting company business. Saldívar, however, instead used it to rent [[Lincoln Town Car]]s, entertain associates in upmarket restaurants, and buy two cellular telephones which she carried.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=147}} Staff at Selena Etc. complained that Saldívar was always "nice" when Selena was around; when she was not Saldívar treated everyone terribly.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=169}}{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=78}} In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer. The company's bank accounts lacked sufficient funds to pay bills.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=82}} Staff levels at both stores had been reduced from thirty-eight to fourteen employees, mainly because Saldívar fired those she did not like.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=182}} The remaining employees began complaining to Selena about Saldívar, but Selena did not believe her friend would hurt her or her business.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=182}} Employees reportedly told Selena that Saldívar was "two-faced [and] was unstable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slain Tejano Star Joining Elvis In Musical Pantheon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/238803559/|accessdate=March 18, 2018|work=Orlando Sun-Sentinel|date=October 29, 1995|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employees then began to take their concerns to Quintanilla, Jr. who warned Selena that Saldívar might be a dangerous person. Selena did not believe Saldívar would turn on her; her father had a habit of distrusting people.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=182}}

In January 1995, Debra Ramirez, Selena's cousin, was hired to work in the boutiques and to help Selena expand the business into Mexico.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=78}} Ramirez quit within a week, telling Saldívar she was dissatisfied with the failure of staff members to report sales.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}} Ramirez also found receipts were missing from the sale of several boutique items.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=78}} Saldívar told her to "mind [her] business" and that it was not her concern.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=78}} Saldívar frequently clashed with Martin Gomez, Selena's fashion designer, who complained that Saldívar was mismanaging Selena's affairs. Their animosity intensified during Selena's fashion shows; Gomez accused Saldívar of mutilating or destroying some of his original creations and said she never paid bills.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}} Gomez stated that Saldívar had "established a reign of terror"; the two were constantly complaining about each other to Selena.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=79}} Saldívar began recording their conversations without Gomez's consent{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=79}} to persuade Selena he was not working for the boutiques' best interests. Gomez was relegated to a supporting role when Selena decided to design her clothes herself.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=79}} Between late 1994 and early 1995, Saldívar often traveled to [[Monterrey, Mexico]], to expedite the process of opening another Selena Etc. store.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=83}} When Saldívar visited the factory in Mexico, she intimidated the seamstresses by telling them to either side with her or leave.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=170}}

=== Selena and Saldívar's relationship ===
Saldívar was receiving "tokens of affection from [Selena]", which she was not accustomed to.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=75}} Her room was covered with Selena posters and pictures, burning [[votive candle]]s, and a library of Selena videos which she played to entertain guests. During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' said her devotion to Selena bordered on obsession.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=146}} Saldívar told employees at Selena Etc. she wanted to "be like Selena".{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=147}} According to an unnamed former employee, Saldívar was "possessive" of her relationship with Selena, and tried to distance Selena from the other employees. This person believed that Saldívar's goal was to "have more control over [the employees] and over Selena".{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=78}} Saldívar said her reason for distancing the employees from Selena was to "shield" the singer from the "petty issues" of managing her boutiques.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=78}} Along with the responsibility of running the boutiques, Saldívar accompanied Selena on trips and had keys to the singer's house.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=79}}

When Saldívar became a business associate, their relationship began to deteriorate.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=146}} In September 1994, Selena met Ricardo Martinez, a doctor who lived in Monterrey, Mexico.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=80}} Selena wanted to expand the number of boutiques by opening a Selena Etc. store in Monterrey.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=80}} Martinez said he had contacts in Mexico who could help her grow her business.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=80}} Martinez became a business adviser to Selena,{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=80}} though her family said he was simply a fan who posed in several pictures with her.{{refn|group=nb|[[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]] (Selena's father and manager of the singer's musical career) disclaimed any involvement of Dr. Ricardo Martinez of having any type of a relationship with Selena.

=== Saldívar's termination of employment ===
Starting in January 1995, Quintanilla, Jr. began receiving telephone calls and letters from angry fans who claimed to have paid their enrollment fees, but had not received the promised memorabilia.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=84}} Upon investigation, Quintanilla, Jr. discovered Saldívar had embezzled more than $60,000 using forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|pp=228–229}} Saldívar's brother, Armando Saldívar, supposedly contacted Gomez and "made up a story" that Saldívar was stealing money from the fan club.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=84}} Gomez then contacted one of Selena's uncles by telephone; the uncle told Quintanilla, Jr.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=84}} Armando said he was angry with Saldívar but did not want the reason to be made public; later he said he felt guilty for starting the rumor.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=84}} He appeared on the Spanish-language television news program ''Primer Impacto'' but reporters found his comments illogical.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=84}}

Quintanilla, Jr. held a meeting on March 9, 1995, with Selena and Suzette Quintanilla at [[Q-Productions]] to confront Saldívar.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}}{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=85}} Quintanilla, Jr. presented Saldívar with evidence concerning the missing funds.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} He said Saldívar simply stared at him without answering any of his questions.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} He further stated how Saldívar did not deny the accusations or said anything during the meeting but was "emotional at times [and at other times] just cool as ice."&lt;ref name="themonitor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Selena Slain|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/331492055|url-access=subscription|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=March 17, 2018|work=The Monitor|pp=1–2|date=April 1, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quintanilla, Jr. told Saldívar he would involve police if she did not produce evidence that disproved his accusations.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} When Quintanilla, Jr. asked her why fans were not receiving the promised gift packages, Saldívar said those fans were trying to get the items for free.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=85}} Quintanilla, Jr. discovered Saldívar had opened the fan club's bank account under her sister's name, "Maria Elida".{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=228}} When asked why she had done this, she replied that the bank would not allow her to open an account in her name; she did not know the reason for this refusal.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=228}} Saldívar abruptly left the meeting. Quintanilla, Jr. then banned Saldívar from contacting Selena. However, Selena did not want to end their friendship; she felt Saldívar was essential to the success of her clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep Saldívar close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax purposes.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} Saldívar's name remained on the payroll after the meeting, though her termination was pending on the retrieval of the financial records that were stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas Ranger Disputes Suspect's Confession in Shooting Selena|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/300798785/|accessdate=March 18, 2018|work=The Odessa American|date=October 19, 1995|p=1, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garciajames"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=James E.|title=Selena Planned to Fire Saldívar, Family Testifies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/356797948/|accessdate=March 18, 2018|work=Austin American-Statesman|date=October 12, 1995|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, Selena told Suzette that she was planning on terminating Saldívar's employment "soon".&lt;ref name="garciajames"/&gt;

After the meeting, Quintanilla, Jr. discovered the fan club's checks were signed with Maria Elida's signature in handwriting identical to Saldívar's.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=228}} He concluded that Saldívar was writing forged checks using her sister's name then cashing them and keeping the funds.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|pp=228–229}} When Quintanilla, Jr. was trying to retrieve the fan club's bank statements, he said they had "vanished".{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=229}} He found a letter in Saldívar's handwriting stating that Maria Elida had to close the bank account because of a major problem.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=229}} According to the letter, a member of the fan club, Yvonne Perales, was sent to the bank to deposit $3,000 but Perales did not deposit the money and could not be found.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=229}} The letter stated that Maria Elida found out about the situation "too late" and that Perales and the money were missing. Maria Elida then wrote checks to be cashed by Saldívar, even though the bank account had no funds.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=229}} The letter said Maria Elida was closing the account for that reason and that the bank would have to cover the checks.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=229}} Quintanilla, Jr. confronted Saldívar about Perales' identity; he said Saldívar knew nothing about her.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=229}} Quintanilla, Jr. said Saldívar did not trust the treasurer of the fan club but she had trusted a complete stranger to deposit $3,000. He told Saldívar to "tell that lie to someone else".{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=229}} He concluded that Perales did not exist, since none of the fan club workers had ever met her.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=230}}

=== Failed attempts to kill Selena ===
The day after Saldívar was banned from contacting Selena, Quintanilla, Jr. drove to Q-Productions and chased her from the premises and told her she was no longer welcome there.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} The same day, Selena and Saldívar argued by telephone; Selena hung up and told her husband she could no longer trust Saldívar.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} The singer and Perez were unsatisfied with Saldívar's explanation of items being unaccounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Jessica|last2=Hart|first2=Lianne|title=Trial Turns Microphone on Selena|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/|accessdate=March 18, 2018|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=October 12, 1995|p=1, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Quintanilla, Jr. there were four attempts to murder Selena.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=231}} Selena removed Saldívar's name from the boutique's bank account on March 10, 1995;{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=231}} she was replaced as fan club president by Irene Herrera.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=184}} The next day, Saldívar purchased a gun at A Place to Shoot,{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=231}} a gun shop and [[shooting range]] in San Antonio. She bought a [[Taurus Model 85]] snub-nosed [[.38 Special|.38-caliber]] [[revolver]] and .38 caliber [[hollow-point bullet]]s; the bullets were designed to cause more extensive injuries than normal bullets.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}} Saldívar told the clerk she needed protection in her job as an in-home nurse because a patient's relatives had threatened her.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=183}}

On March 13, Saldívar went to her lawyer and wrote her resignation, which Quintanilla, Jr. believed was her alibi.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=231}} The same day, Saldívar drove to Corpus Christi and checked into the Sand and Sea Motel.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} Selena was in [[Miami, Florida]], at the time. Quintanilla, Jr. believed this would have been the first attempt to kill Selena.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} When Selena arrived in Corpus Christi on March 14, Saldívar contacted her to schedule a meeting.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} Saldívar told Selena there was too much traffic and asked her to meet her at a parking lot twenty-five miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) away from Corpus Christi.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} Upon arriving, Selena told Saldívar she could remain in charge of her business affairs in Mexico.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} According to Quintanilla, Jr. Selena wanted to continue employing Saldívar until she could find a replacement. Saldívar showed Selena the gun she had bought; Selena told her to "get rid of it" and said she would protect Saldívar from her father, according to Saldívar and Pérez.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}}{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Perez publishes Selena book|url=http://www.sacurrent.com/Blogs/archives/2012/02/28/chris-perez-publishes-selena-book|accessdate=March 7, 2015|work=[[San Antonio Current]]|publisher=Michael Wagner|date=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, Quintanilla, Jr. believed, had calmed Saldívar and was the reason she did not kill Selena in the parking lot.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} The next day, Saldívar returned the gun to the shop{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} saying her father had given her a .22-caliber pistol.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=184}} On March 26, Saldívar stole a perfume sample and more bank statements from Selena in Mexico.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=185}}

Saldívar accompanied Selena on a trip to Tennessee while the singer finished recording a song for her [[crossover (music)|crossover]] album.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} Selena told Saldívar some bank statements were missing and asked her to return them as soon as they returned to Texas.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} Saldívar re-purchased the gun on March 27 and asked Selena to meet her alone at a motel room; this was her second attempt to kill Selena.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=232}} News of Selena's arrival spread and she was soon mobbed by fans.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=233}} Quintanilla, Jr. believed her fans saved her that day; there were "too many witnesses".{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=233}} According to him, the third attempt to kill Selena was during Saldívar's trip to Monterrey in the last week of March.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=233}} Dr. Martinez received telephone calls from Saldívar crying hysterically and saying she had been raped on March 29.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=233}}{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=185}} The next day, Saldívar again called Dr. Martinez, who said the calls sounded as though someone was trying to snatch the telephone away from Saldívar.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=233}} He sent an employee to her motel room to investigate; the employee found she had left a few minutes earlier.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=233}}

On March 30, Saldívar returned from her Monterrey trip and checked into a [[Days Inn]] motel.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=233}} She contacted Selena and told her she had been raped.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=233}} According to Quintanilla, Jr. this was the last message they received from Saldívar; he believed this claim was her new alibi.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=233}} Saldívar asked Selena to visit her at her motel room alone, however, her husband, Chris Pérez, accompanied her.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=234}} According to Pérez, he waited by his truck as Selena went alone to Saldívar's motel room.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=234}} As Pérez was driving back to their house, Selena noticed Saldívar had failed to give her the correct bank statements she needed. Saldívar tried contacting Selena through her pager; she desperately wanted Selena to take her to a hospital that night.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=234}} She told Selena she was bleeding due to her rape.

After the shooting, Saldívar entered her red 1994 GMC pickup truck and tried to leave the motel parking lot.&lt;ref name="hometown"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deselms|first1=Jean|last2=Brooks|first2=Karen|last3=Rosemary|first3=Barnes|title=Selena: Loss of a hometown hero|url=http://www.caller.com/story/entertainment/people/selena/2015/04/14/selena-loss-of-a-hometown-hero/91947600/|accessdate=September 19, 2015|work=[[Corpus Christi Caller Times]]|date=April 1, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motel employee Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=37}}{{sfn|Novas|1995|p=8}} It was later thought she was going to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena.{{sfn|Arrarás|1997|p=235}} However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle.&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck.&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle.&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]], and threatened to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="hometown"/&gt;{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=162}} A [[SWAT]] team and the [[FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit]] were brought in.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=162}} Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of [[O.J.

Larry Young and Isaac Valencia began negotiating with Saldívar. They ran a telephone line to their base of operations adjacent to Saldívar's pickup truck as the standoff continued.&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; Lead negotiator Young tried to establish a rapport with Saldívar and persuade her to give herself up.&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; Valencia suggested the shooting was accidental; Saldívar later changed her story, saying the "gun went off" by itself.&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; She spoke to relatives in addition to speaking with police.&lt;ref name="hometown"/&gt; Motel guests were ordered to remain in their rooms until police escorted them out.{{sfn|Novas|1995|p=12}}
Later that afternoon, police drained the gasoline from the gas tank of Saldívar's car and turned on floodlights.&lt;ref name="hometown"/&gt;

After the standoff entered its fourth hour, Valencia succeeded in getting Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself.&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; Saldívar said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena tried to tell her not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it.&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her head again.&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="FCS"/&gt; A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports.

==Terminology==
{{main|Acute coronary syndrome}}
Myocardial infarction (MI) refers to tissue death ([[infarction]]) of the heart muscle ([[myocardium]]). It is a type of [[acute coronary syndrome]], which describes a sudden or short-term change in symptoms related to blood flow to the heart.&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3010002 Acute Coronary Syndrome]. [[American Heart Association]]. Retrieved November 25, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925134349/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3010002 |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other causes of acute coronary syndromes, such as [[unstable angina]], a myocardial [[infarction]] occurs when there is cell death, as measured by a [[blood test]] for [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarkers]] (the cardiac protein [[troponin]] or  the cardiac enzyme [[CPK-MB test|CK-MB]]).&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britton|first1=the editors Nicki R. Colledge, Brian R. Walker, Stuart H. Ralston ; illustrated by Robert|title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine.|date=2010|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7020-3085-7|edition=21st|pp=588–599}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is evidence of an MI, it may be classified as an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) based on the results of an [[ECG]].&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF /&gt;

The phrase "heart attack" is often used non-specifically to refer to a myocardial infarction and to sudden cardiac death. An MI is different from—but can cause—[[cardiac arrest]], where the heart is not contracting at all or so poorly that all vital organs cease to function, thus causing death. It is also distinct from [[heart failure]], in which the pumping action of the heart is impaired. However, an MI may lead to heart failure.&lt;ref name='ESC STEMI'/&gt;

=== Women ===
[[File:Heart attack warning signs-women.PNG|thumb|Range of myocardial infarction symptoms in women]]
In women, myocardial infarctions can present with different symptoms. The classic presentation of chest pain occurs in about 50% of women. Women can also commonly back or neck pain, indigestion, heartburn, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, or pain in the back of the jaw. These symptoms are often overlooked or mistaken for another condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/warning-signs-of-a-heart-attack/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women|title=Heart Attack Symptoms in Women|website=www.heart.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke/heart-disease/heart-attack-and-women/heart-attack-symptoms|title=Signs of a heart attack in women|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Family history of [[ischemic heart disease]] or MI, particularly if one has a male first-degree relative (father, brother) who had a myocardial infarction before age 55 years, or a female first-degree relative (mother, sister) less than age 65 increases a person's risk of MI.&lt;ref name="EUROPEAN2012" /&gt;

==Mechanism==
===Atherosclerosis===
[[File:Heart attack animation.ogv|thumb|The animation shows plaque buildup or a [[vasospasm|coronary artery spasm]] can lead to a heart attack and how blocked blood flow in a coronary artery can lead to a heart attack.]]
[[File:Blausen 0463 HeartAttack.png|thumb|A myocardial infarction occurs when an [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[Atheroma|plaque]] slowly builds up in the inner lining of a [[coronary artery]] and then suddenly ruptures, causing catastrophic [[thrombus]] formation, totally occluding the artery and preventing blood flow downstream.]]
{{Further|Atherosclerosis}}
&lt;!--Introduction--&gt;The most common cause of a myocardial infarction is the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque on an [[artery]] supplying heart muscle.&lt;ref name='ESC STEMI'/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Grant W|last2=Rossi|first2=Jeffrey E|last3=Cannon|first3=Christopher P|title=Acute myocardial infarction|journal=The Lancet|date=January 2017|volume=389|issue=10065|pages=197–210|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30677-8|pmid=27502078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaques can become unstable, rupture, and additionally promote the formation of a [[thrombus|blood clot]] that blocks the artery; this can occur in minutes. Blockage of an artery can lead to tissue death in tissue being supplied by that artery.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010B /&gt; Atherosclerotic plaques are often present for decades before they result in symptoms.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010B&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britton|first1=the editors Nicki R.

&lt;!--Details--&gt;The gradual buildup of [[cholesterol]] and fibrous tissue in plaques in the wall of the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] or other arteries, typically over decades, is termed [[atherosclerosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid20065951"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woollard KJ, Geissmann F | title = Monocytes in atherosclerosis: subsets and functions | journal = Nature Reviews. Cardiology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–86 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20065951 | pmc = 2813241 | doi = 10.1038/nrcardio.2009.228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atherosclerosis is characterized by progressive inflammation of the walls of the arteries.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010B /&gt; Inflammatory cells, particularly [[macrophage]]s, move into affected arterial walls. Over time, they become laden with cholesterol products, particularly [[LDL]], and become [[foam cell]]s. A [[atheroma|cholesterol core]] forms as foam cells die. In response to [[growth factor]]s secreted by macrophages, [[smooth muscle]] and other cells move into the plaque and act to stabilize it. A stable plaque may have a thick fibrous cap with [[calcification]]. If there is ongoing inflammation, the cap may be thin or ulcerate. Exposed to the pressure associated with blood flow, plaques, especially those with a thin lining, may rupture and trigger the formation of a blood clot (thrombus).&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010B /&gt; The cholesterol crystals  have been associated with plaque rupture through mechanical injury and inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janoudi A, Shamoun FE, Kalavakunta JK, Abela GS | title = Cholesterol crystal induced arterial inflammation and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 37 | issue = 25 | pages = 1959–67 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 26705388 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehv653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other causes===
Atherosclerotic disease is not the only cause of myocardial infarction, and it may exacerbate or contribute to [[#Types|other causes]]. A myocardial infarction may result from a heart with a limited blood supply subject to increased oxygen demands, such as in fever, [[tachycardia|a fast heart rate]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[anemia|too few red blood cells in the bloodstream]], or [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]. Damage or failure of procedures such as [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] or [[coronary artery bypass graft]]s may cause a myocardial infarction. Spasm of coronary arteries, such as [[Prinzmetal's angina]] may cause blockage.&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrisons2015/&gt;

===Tissue death===
[[File:Heart ant wall infarction.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the heart showing anterior left ventricle wall infarction]]
If impaired blood flow to the heart lasts long enough, it triggers a process called the [[ischemic cascade]]; the heart cells in the territory of the blocked coronary artery die ([[:wikt:infarction|infarction]]), chiefly through [[necrosis]], and do not grow back. A [[collagen]] [[scar]] forms in their place.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010B /&gt; When an artery is blocked, cells lack [[oxygen]], needed to produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in [[mitochondria]]. ATP is required for the maintenance of electrolyte balance, particularly through the [[Na/K ATPase]]. This leads to an ischemic cascade of intracellular changes, necrosis and [[apoptosis]] of affected cells.&lt;ref name="BUJA2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buja LM | title = Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury | journal = Cardiovascular Pathology | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 170–5 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16009313 | doi = 10.1016/j.carpath.2005.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Myocardial infarction diagnosis}}

===Criteria===
An acute myocardial infarction, according to current consensus, is defined by elevated cardiac [[biomarkers]] with a rising or falling trend and at least one of the following:&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thygesen |first1=Kristian |last2=Alpert |first2=Joseph S |title=Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) |journal=European Heart Journal |date=25 August 2018 |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehy462|pmid=30165617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Symptoms relating to ischemia
* Changes on an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG), such as [[ST segment]] changes, new [[left bundle branch block]], or [[QRS complex#Q wave|Q wave]]s
* Changes in the motion of the heart wall on imaging
* Demonstration of a thrombus on angiogram or at autopsy.

==={{Anchor|STEMI}}{{Anchor|NSTEMI}}Types===
{{See also|Electrocardiography in myocardial infarction}}
Myocardial infarctions are generally clinically classified into ST elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). These are based on changes to an [[ECG]].&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF/&gt; STEMIs make up about 25 – 40% of myocardial infarctions.&lt;ref name=AHA2013/&gt; A more explicit classification system, based on international consensus in 2012, also exists. This classifies myocardial infarctions into five types:&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF/&gt;
# Spontaneous MI related to plaque erosion and/or rupture, fissuring, or dissection
# MI related to ischemia, such as from increased oxygen demand or decreased supply, e.g. coronary artery spasm, coronary embolism, anemia, arrhythmias, high blood pressure or low blood pressure
# Sudden unexpected cardiac death, including cardiac arrest, where symptoms may suggest MI, an ECG may be taken with suggestive changes, or a blood clot is found in a coronary artery by angiography and/or at autopsy, but where blood samples could not be obtained, or at a time before the appearance of cardiac biomarkers in the blood
# Associated with [[coronary angioplasty]] or stents
#* Associated with [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI)
#* Associated with stent thrombosis as documented by angiography or at autopsy
# Associated with [[coronary artery bypass graft|CABG]]
#Associated with [[spontaneous coronary artery dissection]] in young, fit women

===Cardiac biomarkers===
&lt;!--Troponin--&gt;
There are a number of different [[biomarker]]s used to determine the presence of cardiac muscle damage. [[Troponin]]s, measured through a blood test, are considered to be the best,&lt;ref name=AHA2013/&gt; and are preferred because they have greater [[sensitivity and specificity]] for measuring injury to the heart muscle than other tests.&lt;ref name="Reed2017" /&gt; A rise in troponin occurs within 2–3 hours of injury to the heart muscle, and peaks within 1–2 days. The level of the troponin, as well as a change over time, are useful in measuring and diagnosing or excluding myocardial infarctions, and the diagnostic accuracy of troponin testing is improving over time.&lt;ref name="Reed2017" /&gt; One high-sensitivity cardiac troponin is able to rule out a heart attack as long as the ECG is normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pickering JW, Than MP, Cullen L, Aldous S, Ter Avest E, Body R, Carlton EW, Collinson P, Dupuy AM, Ekelund U, Eggers KM, Florkowski CM, Freund Y, George P, Goodacre S, Greenslade JH, Jaffe AS, Lord SJ, Mokhtari A, Mueller C, Munro A, Mustapha S, Parsonage W, Peacock WF, Pemberton C, Richards AM, Sanchis J, Staub LP, Troughton R, Twerenbold R, Wildi K, Young J | title = Rapid Rule-out of Acute Myocardial Infarction With a Single High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T Measurement Below the Limit of Detection: A Collaborative Meta-analysis | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 166 | issue = 10 | pages = 715–724 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28418520 | doi = 10.7326/M16-2562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapman AR, Lee KK, McAllister DA, Cullen L, Greenslade JH, Parsonage W, Worster A, Kavsak PA, Blankenberg S, Neumann J, Sörensen NA, Westermann D, Buijs MM, Verdel GJ, Pickering JW, Than MP, Twerenbold R, Badertscher P, Sabti Z, Mueller C, Anand A, Adamson P, Strachan FE, Ferry A, Sandeman D, Gray A, Body R, Keevil B, Carlton E, Greaves K, Korley FK, Metkus TS, Sandoval Y, Apple FS, Newby DE, Shah AS, Mills NL | display-authors = 6 | title = Association of High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Concentration With Cardiac Outcomes in Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome | journal = JAMA | volume = 318 | issue = 19 | pages = 1913–1924 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29127948 | pmc = 5710293 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2017.17488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrocardiogram===
[[File:Inferior and RtV MI 12 lead.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A 12-lead ECG showing a STEMI. Elevation of the [[ST segment]] can be seen in some leads.]]
[[Electrocardiogram]]s (ECGs) are a series of leads placed on a person's chest that measure electrical activity associated with contraction of heart muscle.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010C /&gt; The taking of an ECG is an important part in the workup of an AMI,&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF /&gt; and ECGs are often not just taken once, but may be repeated over minutes to hours, or in response to changes in signs or symptoms.&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF /&gt;

===Imaging===
Noninvasive imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and characterisation of myocardial infarction.&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF /&gt; Tests such as [[chest X-ray]]s can be used to explore and exclude alternate causes of a person's symptoms.&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF /&gt; Tests such as stress [[echocardiography]] and [[myocardial perfusion imaging]] can confirm a diagnosis when a person's history, [[physical examination]] (including  [[cardiac examination]]) ECG, and cardiac biomarkers suggest the likelihood of a problem.&lt;ref name="WISELY2017"/&gt;

[[Echocardiography]], an [[ultrasound]] scan of the heart, is able to visualize the heart, its size, shape, and any abnormal motion of the heart walls as they beat that may indicate a myocardial infarction. The flow of blood can be imaged, and [[contrast dye]]s may be given to improve image.&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF /&gt; Other scans using [[radioactive]] contrast include [[SPECT]] [[CT-scans]] using [[thallium chloride|thallium]], [[technetium (99mTc) sestamibi|sestamibi]] ([[MIBI scan]]s) or [[tetrofosmin]]; or a [[PET scan]] using [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|Fludeoxyglucose]] or [[rubidium-82]].&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF /&gt; These [[nuclear medicine]] scans can visualize the perfusion of heart muscle.&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF /&gt; SPECT may also be used to determine viability of tissue, and whether areas of ischemia are inducible.&lt;ref name=THIRDDEF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schinkel AF, Valkema R, Geleijnse ML, Sijbrands EJ, Poldermans D | title = Single-photon emission computed tomography for assessment of myocardial viability | journal = EuroIntervention | volume = 6 | issue = Supplement G | pages = G115–22 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20542817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main|Management of acute coronary syndrome}}
A myocardial infarction requires immediate medical attention. Treatment aims to preserve as much heart muscle as possible, and to prevent further complications.&lt;ref name=Harrisons2015 /&gt; Treatment depends on whether the myocardial infarction is a STEMI or NSTEMI.&lt;ref name=Reed2017 /&gt; Treatment in general aims to unblock blood vessels, reduce blot clot enlargement, reduce ischemia, and modify risk factors with the aim of preventing future MIs.&lt;ref name=Harrisons2015/&gt; In addition, the main treatment for myocardial infarctions with ECG evidence of ST elevation (STEMI) include [[thrombolysis]] or [[percutaneous coronary intervention]], although PCI is also ideally conducted within 1–3 days for NSTEMI.&lt;ref name=Reed2017 /&gt; In addition to clinical judgement, risk stratification may be used to guide treatment, such as with the [[TIMI]] and [[GRACE score|GRACE]] scoring systems.&lt;ref name="Davidsons2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reed2017 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hess EP, Agarwal D, Chandra S, Murad MH, Erwin PJ, Hollander JE, Montori VM, Stiell IG | title = Diagnostic accuracy of the TIMI risk score in patients with chest pain in the emergency department: a meta-analysis | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 182 | issue = 10 | pages = 1039–44 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20530163 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.092119 | pmc = 2900327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation===
[[Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation|Cardiac rehabilitation]] benefits many who have experienced myocardial infarction,&lt;ref name=Reed2017/&gt; even if there has been substantial heart damage and resultant [[left ventricular failure]].

==Prevention==
There is a large crossover between the lifestyle and activity recommendations to prevent a myocardial infarction, and those that may be adopted as [[secondary prevention]] after an initial myocardial infarction,&lt;ref name=Reed2017/&gt; because of shared risk factors and an aim to reduce atherosclerosis affecting heart vessels.&lt;ref name=Harrisons2015 /&gt;

===Primary prevention===
====Lifestyle====
Physical activity can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and people at risk are advised to engage in 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity [[aerobic exercise]] a week.&lt;ref name=NICECG181/&gt; Keeping a healthy weight, drinking alcohol within the recommended limits, and [[smoking cessation|quitting smoking]] reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=NICECG181/&gt;

&lt;!--Diet--&gt;Substituting [[polyunsaturated fat]]s such as [[olive oil]] and [[rapeseed oil]] instead of saturated fats may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction,&lt;ref name=HOOPER2015 /&gt; although there is not universal agreement.&lt;ref name=Chow2014 /&gt; Dietary modifications are recommended by some national authorities, with recommendations including increasing the intake of wholegrain starch, reducing sugar intake (particularly of refined sugar), consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, consuming two or more portions of fish per week, and consuming 4–5 portions of unsalted [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seed]]s, or [[legume]]s per week.&lt;ref name=NICECG181/&gt; The dietary pattern with the greatest support is the [[Mediterranean diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stradling C, Hamid M, Taheri S, Thomas GN | title = A review of dietary influences on cardiovascular health: part 2: dietary patterns | journal = Cardiovascular &amp; Hematological Disorders Drug Targets | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–63 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24993125 | doi = 10.2174/1871529x14666140701095426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vitamin]]s and mineral supplements are of no proven benefit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fortmann SP, Burda BU, Senger CA, Lin JS, Whitlock EP | title = Vitamin and mineral supplements in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer: An updated systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 159 | issue = 12 | pages = 824–34 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24217421 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-159-12-201312170-00729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and neither are plant [[stanol]]s or [[Phytosterol|sterols]].&lt;ref name=NICECG181&gt;{{NICE|181|Lipid modification: cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public health]] measures may also act at a population level to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, for example by reduce unhealthy diets (excessive salt, saturated fat and trans fat) including food labeling and marketing requirements as well as requirements for catering and restaurants, and stimulating physical activity. This may be part of regional cardiovascular disease prevention programs, or through the [[health impact assessment]] of regional and local plans and policies.&lt;ref name=NICEPH25&gt;{{cite web | vauthors=McPherson K, et al. | title=Prevention of cardiovascular disease – NICE public health guidance 25 | publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] | location=London | date=June 2010 | url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/ph25 | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329171156/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/PH25 | archive-date=2014-03-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most guidelines recommend combining different preventive strategies. A 2015 Cochrane Review found some evidence that such an approach might help with&amp;nbsp;[[blood pressure]],&amp;nbsp;[[body mass index]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[waist circumference]].

The prognosis after myocardial infarction varies greatly depending on the extent and location of the affected heart muscle, and the development and management of complications.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010/&gt; Prognosis is worse with older age, and social isolation.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010/&gt; Anterior infarcts, persistent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, development of [[heart block]]s, and left ventricular impairment are all associated with poorer prognosis.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010/&gt; Without treatment, about a quarter of those affected by MI die within minutes, and about forty percent within the first month.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010/&gt; Morbidity and mortality from myocardial infarction has however improved over the years due to earlier and better treatment:&lt;ref name=Harrisons2015B /&gt; in those who have an STEMI in the United States, between 5 and 6&amp;nbsp;percent die before leaving the hospital and 7 to 18&amp;nbsp;percent die within a year.&lt;ref name=AHA2013/&gt;

===Complications===
{{Main|Myocardial infarction complications}}
Complications may occur immediately following the myocardial infarction or may take time to develop. [[Heart arrhythmia|Disturbances of heart rhythm]]s, including [[atrial fibrillation]], [[ventricular tachycardia]] and [[ventricular fibrillation|fibrillation]] and [[heart block]] can arise as a result of ischemia, cardiac scarring, and infarct location.&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reed2017/&gt; [[Stroke]] is also a risk, either as a result of [[Arterial embolism|clots]] transmitted from the heart during PCI, as a result of bleeding following anticoagulation, or as a result of disturbances in the heart's ability to pump effectively as a result of the infarction.&lt;ref name=Reed2017/&gt; [[mitral regurgitation|Regurgitation of blood through the mitral valve]] is possible, particularly if the infarction causes dysfunction of the papillary muscle.&lt;ref name=Reed2017/&gt; [[Cardiogenic shock]] as a result of the heart being unable to adequately pump blood may develop, dependent on infarct size, and is most likely to occur within the days following an acute myocardial infarction. Cardiogenic shock is the largest cause of in-hospital mortality.&lt;ref name=Harrisons2015B /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reed2017/&gt; Rupture of the ventricular dividing wall or left ventricular wall may occur within the initial weeks.&lt;ref name=Reed2017/&gt; [[Dressler's syndrome]], a reaction following larger infarcts and a cause of [[pericarditis]] is also possible.&lt;ref name=Reed2017/&gt;

[[Heart failure]] may develop as a long-term consequence, with an impaired ability of heart muscle to pump, scarring, and increase in size of the existing muscle. [[Ventricular aneurysm|Aneurysm of the left ventricle myocardium]] develops in about 10% of MI and is itself a risk factor for heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia and the development of [[embolism|clots]].&lt;ref name=Davidsons2010/&gt;

Risk factors for complications and death include age, [[Hemodynamics|hemodynamic]] parameters (such as [[heart failure]], [[cardiac arrest]] on admission, [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] [[blood pressure]], or [[Killip class]] of two or greater), ST-segment deviation, diabetes, serum [[creatinine]], [[Peripheral artery occlusive disease|peripheral vascular disease]], and elevation of cardiac markers.&lt;ref name="PEPA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = López de Sá E, López-Sendón J, Anguera I, Bethencourt A, Bosch X | title = Prognostic value of clinical variables at presentation in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes: results of the Proyecto de Estudio del Pronóstico de la Angina (PEPA) | journal = Medicine | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 434–42 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12441900 | doi = 10.1097/00005792-200211000-00004 | author6 = Proyecto de Estudio del Pronostico de la Angina (PEPA) Investigators }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRACE"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KA, Dabbous OH, Goldberg RJ, Pieper KS, Eagle KA, Van de Werf F, Avezum A, Goodman SG, Flather MD, Anderson FA, Granger CB | title = Prediction of risk of death and myocardial infarction in the six months after presentation with acute coronary syndrome: prospective multinational observational study (GRACE) | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7578 | pages = 1091 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17032691 | pmc = 1661748 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38985.646481.55 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7578/1091 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090309044229/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7578/1091 | df =  | deadurl = no | archive-date = 2009-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weir-2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weir RA, McMurray JJ, Velazquez EJ | title = Epidemiology of heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction: prevalence, clinical characteristics, and prognostic importance | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | volume = 97 | issue = 10A | pages = 13F–25F | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16698331 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2006.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Myocardial infarction is a common presentation of [[coronary artery disease]]. The [[World Health Organization]] estimated in 2004, that 12.2% of worldwide deaths were from ischemic heart disease;&lt;ref name="WHO-2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=World Health Organization |title=The Global Burden of Disease: 2004 Update |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=2008 |isbn=978-92-4-156371-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with it being the leading cause of death in high- or middle-income countries and second only to [[Lower respiratory tract infection|lower respiratory infections]] in [[developing country|lower-income countries]].&lt;ref name="WHO-2004" /&gt;  Worldwide, more than 3 million people have STEMIs and 4 million have NSTEMIs a year.&lt;ref name="Lancet08"/&gt; STEMIs occur about twice as often in men as women.&lt;ref name=AHA2013/&gt;

Rates of death from ischemic heart disease (IHD) have slowed or declined in most high-income countries, although cardiovascular disease still accounted for one in three of all deaths in the USA in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((American Heart Association Statistics Committee and Stroke Statistics)), Roger VL, Go AS, Lloyd-Jones DM, Benjamin EJ, Berry JD, Borden WB, Bravata DM, Dai S, Ford ES, Fox CS, Fullerton HJ, Gillespie C, Hailpern SM, Heit JA, Howard VJ, Kissela BM, Kittner SJ, Lackland DT, Lichtman JH, Lisabeth LD, Makuc DM, Marcus GM, Marelli A, Matchar DB, Moy CS, Mozaffarian D, Mussolino ME, Nichol G, Paynter NP, Soliman EZ, Sorlie PD, Sotoodehnia N, Turan TN, Virani SS, Wong ND, Woo D, Turner MB | display-authors = 6 | title = Executive summary: heart disease and stroke statistics--2012 update: a report from the American Heart Association | journal = Circulation | volume = 125 | issue = 1 | pages = 188–97 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22215894 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0b013e3182456d46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, rates of death from cardiovascular disease have decreased almost a third between 2001 and 2011 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mozaffarian D, Benjamin EJ, Go AS, Arnett DK, Blaha MJ, Cushman M, de Ferranti S, Després JP, Fullerton HJ, Howard VJ, Huffman MD, Judd SE, Kissela BM, Lackland DT, Lichtman JH, Lisabeth LD, Liu S, Mackey RH, Matchar DB, McGuire DK, Mohler ER, Moy CS, Muntner P, Mussolino ME, Nasir K, Neumar RW, Nichol G, Palaniappan L, Pandey DK, Reeves MJ, Rodriguez CJ, Sorlie PD, Stein J, Towfighi A, Turan TN, Virani SS, Willey JZ, Woo D, Yeh RW, Turner MB | display-authors = 6 | title = Heart disease and stroke statistics--2015 update: a report from the American Heart Association | journal = Circulation | volume = 131 | issue = 4 | pages = e29–322 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25520374 | doi = 10.1161/cir.0000000000000152 | quote = From 2001 to 2011, death rates attributable to CVD declined 30.8%. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, IHD is becoming a more common cause of death in the developing world. For example, in [[India]], IHD had become the leading cause of death by 2004, accounting for 1.46 million deaths (14% of total deaths) and deaths due to IHD were expected to double during 1985–2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta R, Joshi P, Mohan V, Reddy KS, Yusuf S | title = Epidemiology and causation of coronary heart disease and stroke in India | journal = Heart | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–26 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18083949 | doi = 10.1136/hrt.2007.132951 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, [[disability adjusted life year]]s (DALYs) lost to ischemic heart disease are predicted to account for 5.5% of total DALYs in 2030, making it the second-most-important cause of disability (after [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar depressive disorder]]), as well as the leading cause of death by this date.&lt;ref name="WHO-2004"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
Depictions of heart attacks in popular media often include collapsing or loss of consciousness which are not common symptoms; these depictions contribute to widespread misunderstanding about the symptoms of myocardial infarctions, which in turn contributes to people not getting care when they should.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perry K, Petrie KJ, Ellis CJ, Horne R, Moss-Morris R | title = Symptom expectations and delay in acute myocardial infarction patients | journal = Heart | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 91–3 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11410572 | pmc = 1729795 | doi = 10.1136/heart.86.1.91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal implications===
At [[common law]], in general, a myocardial infarction is a [[disease]], but may sometimes be an [[injury]]. This can create coverage issues in the administration of no-fault insurance schemes such as [[workers' compensation]]. In general, a heart attack is not covered;&lt;ref name=prairieview&gt;[http://www.pvamu.edu/pages/2026.asp Workers' Compensation FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711235600/http://www.pvamu.edu/pages/2026.asp |date=2007-07-11 }}. [[Prairie View A&amp;M University]]. Retrieved November 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; however, it may be a [[Industrial injury|work-related injury]] if it results, for example, from unusual emotional stress or unusual exertion.&lt;ref name=biia&gt;[http://www.biia.wa.gov/significantdecisions/contents.htm SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS Subject Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206115257/http://www.biia.wa.gov/SignificantDecisions/contents.htm |date=2006-12-06 }}. Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals. Retrieved November 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, in some jurisdictions, heart attacks suffered by persons in particular occupations such as [[police officer]]s may be classified as line-of-duty injuries by statute or policy. In some countries or states, a person having suffered from an MI may be prevented from participating in activity that puts other people's lives at risk, for example driving a car or flying an airplane.&lt;ref name="NovaScotia-DrivingRegulations"&gt;{{cite web | title=Classification of Drivers' Licenses Regulations | publisher=Nova Scotia Registry of Regulations | date=May 24, 2000 | url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/just/regulations/regs/mvclasdl.htm | access-date=April 22, 2007 | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420191108/http://www.gov.ns.ca/just/regulations/regs/mvclasdl.htm | archive-date=April 20, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''National Eisteddfod of Wales''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''{{lang|cy|Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru}}'') is the most important of several [[eisteddfod]]au that are held annually, mostly in [[Wales]]. Its eight days of competitions and performances are considered the largest music and poetry festival in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Sian|authorlink=Sian Williams|title=Druids, bards and rituals: What is an Eisteddfod?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/ztbk87h|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors typically number 6,000 or more, and overall attendance generally exceeds 150,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Oliver|last2=Else|first2=David|last3=Atkinson|first3=David|title=Discover Great Britain|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a8qi9lWrrbYC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=National+Eisteddfod+of+Wales+6,000+comeptitors+150,000+visitors&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0mM-tQAX6i&amp;sig=xnHmYIzUoOLm0ORxjGYDfpZMgeA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0xpvn2KHLAhVCdw8KHe43DfUQ6AEITDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=National%20Eisteddfod%20of%20Wales%206%2C000%20comeptitors%20150%2C000%20visitors&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|year=2010|page=272|isbn=978-1-74179-993-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 Eisteddfod was held in [[Cardiff Bay]].

==History==
[[File:Grand National Eisteddfod, Caernarvon 1877.jpg|thumb|left|160px|An advertisement for the Grand National Eisteddfod at Caernarvon, 1877]] The [[National Museum of Wales]] says that "the history of the Eisteddfod may [be] traced back to a bardic competition held by the [[Lord Rhys]] in Cardigan Castle in 1176",&lt;ref name="museum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://museum.wales/collections/eisteddfodau/ |title=History of the Welsh Eisteddfodau |publisher=National Museum Wales |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Local Eisteddfodau have certainly been held for many years prior to the first national Eisteddfod. There have been multiple Eisteddfodau held on a national scale in Wales, such as the Gwyneddigion Eisteddfod of {{Start date and age|1789|df=y}}, the Provincial Eisteddfodau from 1819-1834,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://museum.wales/collections/eisteddfodau/provincial/ |title=The Provincial Eisteddfodau 1819-1834 |publisher=National Museum Wales |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Abergavenny Eisteddfodau of 1835-1851,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://museum.wales/collections/eisteddfodau/abergavenny/ |title=The Abergavenny Eisteddfod &amp;#124; National Museum Wales |publisher=Museum.wales |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/Eisteddfod.html|title=Welsh National Eisteddfodau|publisher=Genuki|date=23 February 2013|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/eisteddfod/history/|title=History of the Welsh Eisteddfodau|publisher=National Museum Wales|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Great Llangollen Eisteddfod of 1858,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://museum.wales/collections/eisteddfodau/national/llangollen-1858/ |title=The Great Llangollen Eisteddfod, 1858 &amp;#124; National Museum Wales |publisher=Museum.wales |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the National Eisteddfod of Wales as an organisation traces its history back to the first event held in 1861, in [[Aberdare]].&lt;ref name="venues-list"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/past-locations/ |title=Past locations |publisher=National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=8 April 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729214952/http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/past-locations/ |archivedate=July 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/past-locations/ |title=The Eisteddfod: 1861–1885 |publisher=National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=8 April 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729214952/http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/past-locations/ |archivedate=July 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the most dramatic events in Eisteddfod history was the award of the 1917 chair to the poet Ellis Humphrey Evans, [[bardic name]] [[Hedd Wyn]], for the poem ''Yr Arwr'' (The Hero). The winner was announced, and the crowd waited for the winner to stand up to accept the traditional congratulations before the chairing ceremony, but no winner appeared. It was then announced that Hedd Wyn had been killed the previous month on the battlefield at Passchendaele in [[Belgium]]. These events were portrayed in the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]''.

In 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the Eisteddfod was not held, for fear that it would be a bombing target. Instead, the BBC broadcast an Eisteddfod radio programme, and the Chair, Crown and a Literature Medal (as opposed to the usual Prose Medal) were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/canrif/1940.shtml| title=Lleoliad yr Eisteddfod: Eisteddfod Radio| publisher=BBC| accessdate=16 August 2012|language=cy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 a new rule was created that required all competitions to be held in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. However, settings of the [[Mass (music)|mass]] in Latin are allowed and this has been controversially used to allow concerts featuring international soloists.&lt;ref name=loophole&gt;{{cite web|author=Rhodri Clark |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-latin-in-language-loophole-2198426 |title=Eisteddfod Latin in language loophole |publisher=Wales Online |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years efforts have been made to attract more non-Welsh speakers to the event, with the officlal website stating "everyone is welcome at the Eisteddfod, whatever language they speak". The Eisteddfod offers bilingual signage and simultaneous-translation of many events though wireless headphones. There is also a Welsh-learners area called Maes D. These efforts has helped increase takings, and the 2006 Eisteddfod reported a profit of over £100,000, despite costing £2.8m to stage. The Eisteddfod attracts some 160,000 people annually. The National Eisteddfod in Cardiff (2008) drew record crowds, with over 160,000 visitors attending.

It is proposed that the 2018 National Eisteddfod in Cardiff will use permanent buildings to host events rather than in the traditional Maes and tents. This is due partially to a lack of suitable land that can be repaired affordably after the festival. It has been billed as an "Eisteddfod with no fence" in the media and is planned to take place at Cardiff Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801233456/https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |archivedate=2017-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eryl Crump |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/hundreds-parade-2018-national-eisteddfod-13235195 |title=Hundreds parade for 2018 National Eisteddfod proclamation |publisher=Daily Post |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Huw |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33813043 |title=National Eisteddfod considers ditching the Maes in 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eisteddfod of 2019 is planned to return to the traditional Maes.

== Overview ==
[[File:Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru, Glynebwy, 1958.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Chairing of the Bard|chairing]] ceremony of the 1958 National Eisteddfod; the victorious poet was [[T. Llew Jones]]]]
[[File:Gwawr - solar vehicle.jpg|thumb|250px|The solar-powered car ''Gwawr'' ("Dawn"), the Welsh entry in the October 2007 Darwin-Adelaide Trans-Australia competition, is an example of what can be exhibited on the Eisteddfod ''Maes'' (''Arena''). (Mold, 2007)]]
[[File:Y Lle Celf.JPG|thumb|250px|'[[Y Lle Celf]]' (Blaenau Gwent, 2010)]]
The National Eisteddfod is traditionally held in the first week of August, and the competitions are all held in the [[Welsh language]]. However, settings of the [[Mass (music)|mass]] in Latin are allowed and this has been controversially used to allow concerts featuring international soloists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rhodri Clark |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-latin-in-language-loophole-2198426 |title=Eisteddfod Latin in language loophole |publisher=Wales Online |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue is officially proclaimed a year in advance, at which time the themes and texts for the competitions are published. The organisation for the location will have begun a year or more earlier, and locations are generally known two or three years ahead. The [[Eisteddfod Act]] of 1959 allowed local authorities to give financial support to the event. Traditionally the Eisteddfod venue alternates between north and south Wales; the decision to hold both the 2014 and 2015 Eisteddfodau in South Wales was thus seen as controversial,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; but the decision was later reversed and Montgomeryshire named as host county for 2015.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/eisteddfod/2011/sites/news/pages/eisteddfod_2016.shtml Site for the Eisteddfod until 2016] at BBC Wales, 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally the Eisteddfod has been held in England, although the last occasion was in 1929.&lt;ref name="venues-list" /&gt;

Hundreds of tents, pavilions and booths are erected in an open space to create the ''maes'' (field). The space required for this means that it is rare for the Eisteddfod to be in a city or town: instead it is held somewhere with more space. Car parking for day visitors alone requires several large fields, and many people camp on the site for the whole week.

The festival has a quasi-[[Gorsedd|druidic]] flavour, with the main literary prizes for poetry and prose being awarded in colourful and dramatic ceremonies under the auspices of the [[Gorsedd]] of Bards of the Island of Britain, complete with prominent figures in Welsh cultural life dressed in flowing druidic costumes, flower dances, trumpet fanfares and a symbolic [[cornucopia|Horn of Plenty]]. However, the [[Gorsedd]] is not an ancient institution or a pagan ceremony but rather a romantic creation by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in the 1790s, which first became a formal part of the Eisteddfod ceremonial in 1819.&lt;ref name="museum1"/&gt; Nevertheless, it is taken very seriously, and an award of a crown or a chair for poetry is a great honour. The [[Chairing of the Bard|Chairing]] and [[Crowning of the Bard|Crowning]] ceremonies are the highlights of the week, and are presided over by the [[Archdruid]]. Other important awards include the {{illm|Prose Medal|cy|Medal Ryddiaith}} (first introduced in 1937).

If no stone circle is there already, one is created out of [[Gorsedd stones]], usually taken from the local area. These stone circles are icons all across Wales and signify the Eisteddfod having visited a community. As a cost-saving measure, the 2005 Eisteddfod was the first to use a temporary "fibre-glass stone" circle for the druidic ceremonies instead of a permanent stone circle. This also has the benefit of bringing the Gorsedd ceremonies onto the ''maes'': previously they were often held many miles away, hidden from most of the public. 
 
As well as the main pavilion with the main stage, there are other venues through the week. Some are fixtures every year, hosting gigs (Maes B/Llwyfan y Maes/Caffi Maes B). Other fixtures of the ''maes'' are the ''Pabell Lên'' (literature pavilion), the ''Neuadd Ddawns'' (dance hall), the ''Pabell Wyddoniaeth a Thechnoleg'' (science and technology pavilion), ''Maes D'' (learners' pavilion), at least one theatre, ''Y Cwt Drama'' (the drama hut), ''Tŷ Gwerin'' (folk house), ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' ("the Art Place") and hundreds of ''stondinau'' (stands and booths) where groups, societies, councils, charities and shops exhibit and sell. Since 2004, alcohol has been sold on the ''maes''; previously there was a no-alcohol policy.

'''Norman Foster Ramsey Jr.''' (August 27, 1915 – November 4, 2011) was an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]] who was awarded the 1989 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], for the invention of the separated oscillatory field method, which had important applications in the construction of [[atomic clock]]s. A [[physics]] [[professor]] at [[Harvard University]] for most of his career, Ramsey also held several posts with such [[government]] and international agencies as [[NATO]] and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]].  Among his other accomplishments are helping to found the [[United States Department of Energy]]'s [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and [[Fermilab]].

== Early life ==
Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], on August 27, 1915, to Minna Bauer Ramsey, an instructor at the [[University of Kansas]], and Norman Foster Ramsey,&lt;ref name="autobiog"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1989/ramsey/auto-biography/ |title=Norman F. Ramsey – Autobiography |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1905 graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] and an officer in the [[Ordnance Department]] who rose to the rank of [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]] during [[World War II]], commanding the [[Rock Island Arsenal]].{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=101}} He was raised as an [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|Army brat]], frequently moving from post to post, and lived in France for a time when his father was Liaison Officer with the ''Direction d'Artillerie'' and Assistant [[Military Attaché]].{{sfn|Cullum|1930|pp=669-670}} This allowed him to skip a couple of grades along the way, so that he graduated from [[Leavenworth High School]] in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], at the age of 15.&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt;

Ramsey's parents hoped that he would go to West Point, but at 15, he was too young to be admitted. He was awarded a scholarship to [[Kansas University]], but in 1930 his father was posted to [[Governors Island]], New York.&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt;{{sfn|Cullum|1940|pp=167-168}} Ramsey therefore entered [[Columbia University]] in 1931, and began studying [[engineering]]. He became interested in [[mathematics]], and switched to this as his [[academic major]]. By the time he received his [[B.A.]] from Columbia in 1935, he had become interested in [[physics]].&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/028/000099728/ |title=Norman F. Ramsey |publisher=Soylent Communications |accessdate=June 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia awarded him a [[Kellett Fellowship]] to [[Cambridge University]] where he studied physics at [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under [[Lord Rutherford]] and [[Maurice Goldhaber]], and encountered notable physicists including [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]], [[Max Born]], [[Edward Bullard]], [[James Chadwick]], [[John Cockcroft]], [[Paul Dirac]], [[Arthur Eddington]], [[Ralph Howard Fowler|Ralph Fowler]], [[Mark Oliphant]] and [[J.J. Thomson]].&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt; At Cambridge, he took the [[tripos]] in order to study [[quantum mechanics]], which had not been covered at Columbia, resulting in being awarded a second B.A. degree by Cambridge.&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;

A term paper Ramsey wrote for Goldhaber on [[magnetic moment]]s caused him to read recent papers on the subject by [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]],&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt; and this stimulated an interest in [[molecular beam]]s, and in doing research for a [[Ph.D.]] under Rabi at Columbia.&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |title=Norman Ramsey obituary |first=Anthony |last=Tucker |date=November 18, 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/18/norman-ramsey | accessdate=February 13, 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Ramsey arrived at Columbia, Rabi invented [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|molecular beam resonance spectroscopy]], for which he was awarded the [[Nobel prize in physics]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1944/rabi.html |title=Isidor Isaac Rabi |accessdate=17 August 2012 |publisher=Nobel Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsey was part of Rabi's team that also included [[Jerome Kellogg]], [[Polykarp Kusch]], [[Sidney Millman]] and [[Jerrold Zacharias]]. Ramsey  worked with them on the first experiments making use of the new technique, and shared with Rabi and Zacharias in the discovery that the [[deuteron]] was a magnetic [[quadrupole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=J.

== World War II ==

=== Radiation laboratory ===
[[File:P-61 from above.jpg|right|thumb|The Northrop P-61 Black Widow [[night fighter]] was specifically designed to take advantage of the new radar]]
In 1940, he married Elinor Jameson of [[Brooklyn, New York]], and accepted a teaching position at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. The two expected to spend the rest of their lives there, but World War II intervened.&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt; In September 1940 the British [[Tizard Mission]] brought a number of new technologies to the United States, including a [[cavity magnetron]], a high-powered device that generates [[microwave]]s using the interaction of a stream of [[electron]]s with a [[magnetic field]]. This device, which promised to revolutionize [[radar]], demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. [[Alfred Lee Loomis]] of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] established the [[Radiation Laboratory]]  at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to develop this technology.{{sfn|Conant|2002|pp=209–213}} Ramsey was one of the scientists recruited by Rabi for this work.{{sfn|Conant|2002|p=204}}

Initially, Ramsey was in Rabi's magnetron group. When Rabi became a division head, Ramsey became the group leader.&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt; The role of the group was to develop the magnetron to permit a reduction in [[wavelength]] from {{convert|150|cm}} to {{convert|10|cm}}, and then to {{convert|3|cm}} or X-Band. Microwave radar promised to be small, lighter and more efficient than older types,{{sfn|Rigden|1987|pp=135–135}} Ramsey's group started with the design produced by Oliphant's team in Britain, and attempted to improve it. The Radiation Laboratory produced the designs, which were prototyped by [[Raytheon]], and then tested by the laboratory. In June 1941, Ramsey travelled to Britain, where he met with Oliphant, and the two exchanged ideas. He brought back some British components which were incorporated into the final design. A [[night fighter]] aircraft, the [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]], was designed around the new radar. Ramsey returned to Washington in late 1942 as an adviser on the use of the new 3&amp;nbsp;cm microwave radar sets that were now coming into service,&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; working for [[Edward L. Bowles]] in the office of the [[Secretary of War]], [[Henry L. Stimson]].&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;

=== Manhattan Project ===
In 1943, Ramsey was approached by [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Robert Bacher]], who asked him to join the [[Manhattan Project]]. Ramsey agreed to do so, but the intervention of the Project director, Brigadier General [[Leslie R. Groves Jr.]], was necessary in order to prise him away from the Secretary of War's office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained on the payroll of the Secretary of War, and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project.&lt;ref name="IEEE" /&gt;{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=59}}{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=378-379}} In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] with Ramsey as group leader, with the task of integrating the design and delivery of the [[nuclear weapon]]s being built by the laboratory.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=378-379}}

[[File:Ramsey signs the Fat man.jpg|thumb|left|Ramsey signs the [[Fat Man]] used at Nagasaki]]
The first thing he had to do was determine the characteristics of the aircraft that would be used. There were only two [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft large enough: the British [[Avro Lancaster]] and the US [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=378-379}} The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=254}} Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Dahlgren, Virginia]], in August 1943, before moving to [[Edwards Air Force Base|Muroc Dry Lake, California]], in March 1944. Mock ups of [[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]] and [[Fat Man]] bombs were dropped and tracked by an [[SCR-584]] ground-based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=380-382}}

Plans for the delivery of the weapons in combat were assigned to the Weapons Committee, which was chaired by Ramsey, and answerable to [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=248}} Ramsey drew up tables of organization and equipment for the [[Project Alberta]] detachment that would accompany the USAAF's [[509th Composite Group]] to [[Tinian]]. Ramsey briefed the 509th's commander, Lieutenant Colonel [[Paul W. Tibbets]], on the nature of the mission when the latter assumed command of the 509th.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=387-388}} Ramsey went to Tinian with the Project Alberta detachment as Parsons's scientific and technical deputy. He was involved in the assembly of the Fat Man bomb, and relayed Parsons's message indicating the success of the [[bombing of Hiroshima]] to Groves in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=392-393}}

== Research ==
At the end of the war, Ramsey returned to Columbia as a professor and research scientist.&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt; Rabi and Ramsey picked up where they had left off before the war with their molecular beam experiments. Ramsey and his first graduate student, [[William Nierenberg]], measured various nuclear [[magnetic dipole]] and [[electric quadrupole]] moments. With Rabi, he helped establish the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] on [[Long Island]]. In 1946, he became the first head of the Physics Department there. His time there was brief, for in 1947, he joined the physics faculty at [[Harvard University]], where he would remain for the next 40 years, except for brief visiting professorships at [[Middlebury College]], [[Oxford University]], [[Mt. Holyoke College]] and the [[University of Virginia]]. During the 1950s, he was the first science adviser to [[NATO]], and initiated a series of fellowships, grants and summer school programs to train European scientists.&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Norman_F._Ramsey_%281991%29 |title=Norman F.

[[File:Cyclo ramsey daven.jpg|thumb|right|The Harvard cyclotron during construction in 1948. Shown are Ramsey (left) and [[Lee Davenport]] (right)]]
Ramsey's research in the immediate post-war years looked at measuring fundamental properties of atoms and molecules by use of molecular beams. On moving to Harvard, his objective was to carry out accurate molecular beam magnetic resonance experiments, based on the techniques developed by Rabi. However, the accuracy of the measurements depended on the uniformity of the magnetic field, and Ramsey found that it was difficult to create sufficiently uniform magnetic fields. He developed the separated oscillatory field method in 1949 as a means of achieving the accuracy he wanted.&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt;

Ramsey and his PhD student [[Daniel Kleppner]] developed the atomic hydrogen [[maser]], looking to increase the accuracy with which the [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] separations of atomic [[hydrogen]], [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] could be measured, as well as to investigate how much the hyperfine structure was affected by external magnetic and electric fields. He also participated in developing an extremely stable clock based on a hydrogen maser. Since 1967, [[Proposed redefinition of SI base units|the second has been defined]] based on  9,192,631,770  hyperfine transition of a [[cesium-133]] atom; the [[atomic clock]] which is used to set this standard is an application of Ramsey's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/press.html |title=Nobel Prize press release |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1989 "for the invention of the separated oscillatory fields method and its use in the hydrogen maser and other atomic clocks".&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1989|publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prize was shared with [[Hans G. Dehmelt]] and [[Wolfgang Paul]].&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt;

In collaboration with the [[Institut Laue–Langevin]], Ramsey also worked on applying similar methods to beams of neutrons, measuring the [[neutron magnetic moment]] and finding a limit to its [[neutron electric dipole moment|electric dipole moment]].&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt; As President of the [[Universities Research Association]] during the 1960s he was involved in the design and construction of the [[Fermilab]] in [[Batavia, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="National Geographic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; He also headed a 1982 [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] committee that concluded that, contrary to the findings of the [[House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations]], that [[John F. Kennedy assassination Dictabelt recording|acoustic evidence did not indicate the presence of a second gunman's involvement]] in the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

== Later life ==
Ramsey eventually became the [[Eugene Higgins professor of physics]] at Harvard and retired in 1986. However, he remained active in physics, spending a year as a research fellow at the  [[Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics]] (JILA) at the [[University of Colorado]]. He also continued  visiting professorships at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Williams College]] and the [[University of Michigan]]. In addition to the Nobel Prize in Physics, Ramsey received a number of awards, including the [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] in 1960, [[Davisson-Germer Prize]] in 1974, the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] in 1984, the [[I. I. Rabi Award|Rabi Prize]] in 1985, the [[Rumford Prize|Rumford Premium Prize]] in 1985, the  Compton Medal in 1986, and the [[Oersted Medal]] and the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="autobiog" /&gt;  In 2004, he signed a letter along with 47 other [[Nobel laureate]]s endorsing [[John Kerry]] for President of the United States as someone who would "restore science to its appropriate place in government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/kerry/kerrynobel062104.html |publisher=[[George Washington University]] |title=48 Nobel Winning Scientists Endorse Kerry-June 21, 2004 |accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first wife, Elinor, died in 1983, after which he married Ellie Welch of Brookline, Massachusetts. Ramsey died on November 4, 2011. He was survived by his wife Ellie, his four daughters from his first marriage, and his stepdaughter and stepson from his second marriage.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |author=|title=Norman Ramsey Dies at 96; Work Led to the Atomic Clock |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/us/norman-ramsey-dies-at-96-work-led-to-the-atomic-clock.html?ref=obituaries |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=November 6, 2011 |accessdate=November 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group curates, commissions, produces, and presents new moving image works that also include music, architecture, design, film, interaction design, computer gaming and live audio visual explorations.

== History ==
onedotzero was created in 1996 by writer and former film critic [[Matt Hanson]] as a film festival designed to promote [[new media]] [[collective]]s and new digital art works developing in [[London]]. The festival promoted the new desktop [[digital film]]making tools that were becoming available, which Hanson termed 'the [[film studio]] in your flat.' It allowed exploration of a film on a single screen, interactive and live audio-visual work. onedotzero was the first festival to present and commission audio visual performances, [[computer gaming]] visuals, [[music video]]s, and [[Advertising|commercials]] in a film and arts context.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The first festival in 1997 was produced with a short-lived new media arts collective, ''onearmbandit''. From this group, new media and [[theatre producer]] Shane Walter joined Hanson as joint festival director for the second festival (onedotzero2,1998) and subsequent festivals. Hanson and Walter established the onedotzero company later in 1997. After Hanson resigned as director at the end of 2001 Walter continued as sole director of onedotzero6 and subsequent festivals.

Other directors whose [[music video]] work was shown in early festivals include [[Chris Cunningham]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[Mike Mills]] and [[Michel Gondry]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In November 2008 the festival onedotzero_adventures in motion was held at the [[BFI Southbank]] and [[BFI IMAX]] for the first time. The festival tours internationally, including [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, New York, France, Russia, with sell-out festivals at London’s BFI Southbank in November 8{{Year needed|date=October 2016}}. and in Buenos Aires in September 8{{Year needed|date=October 2016}}. The festival includes themed compilation screenings featuring [[short film]], music videos, animation and motion graphic from several countries. It also features live audiovisual performance.

In 2008, onedotzero held two events in the BFI IMAX. They commissioned British musician [[Nitin Sawhney]] to collaborate with stage designer [[Es Devlin]] and [[onedotzero industries]] for a one-off show. They also hosted a night featuring audiovisual acts [[The Light Surgeons]], [[D-Fuse AV]] and [[Hexstatic]]. The festival also featured [[Installation art|installations]] by artists including [[Jason Bruges]], [[Troika (artists)|Troika]], [[Doodlearth]] and [[Hexstatic]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 2006, to mark the tenth anniversary of onedotzero, the group held a series of events, including onedotzero_transvision at the [[Victoria and Albert museum]], onedotzero_amour at the [[Tate Modern]], and onedotzero_metamorphosis at the [[Hayward Gallery]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In [[Screen International]]’s 25th anniversary issue onedotzero directors Hanson and Walter were named{{by whom|date=October 2016}} as one of the top ten visionaries of the [[UK film industry]] alongside [[Ridley Scott]], [[Christopher Nolan|Chris Nolan]] and [[Lynne Ramsay]]. The ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Film Unlimited]]'' described its work as ''the most, crucial groundbreaking festival of the early 21st-century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/apr/23/onedotzero|title=Signs of the times|date=April 23, 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

onedotzero held a festival in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] In September 2008,  with over 50,000 people attending over the weekend,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} for screenings, installations and live events from [[Mole (entertainer)|Mole]] and [[Martin Philips]], [[Christian Wloch]], [[Peter, Bjorn and John]] and [[Hexstatic]]

In 2009 they again held their film festival at the BFI in London "adventures in Motion" and co-curated (with the V &amp; A Museum) "decode: digital design sensations" with new work in digital and interactive design, from small screen based graphics to large-scale installations, and included 35 works by artists and designers including Daniel Brown, Golan Levin and Daniel Rozin as well as new designers including Troika and Mehmet Akten.

[[Squadron Leader]] '''Peter Christy''' (1937 – 6 December 1971), [[Sitara-i-Jurat|SJ]], was a [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]] bomber pilot and [[weapon systems officer]] (WSO). A [[B-57 Canberra]] navigator, Squadron Leader Christy was officially declared "[[missing in action]]" since December 1971, but widely presumed dead by the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistan Defence Forces]] {{as of|2004|lc=y}}.

==Education==
Christy was born in [[Karachi]] then-[[British India]] in 1937. The son of Maola Bakhsh Christy, a fire fighter in the Air Force who belonged to Multan.{{clarify|date=December 2017|reason=What does "belonged to Multan" mean?}} He initially completed his secondary school education at [[St Patrick's High School, Karachi]] and [[Matriculation|matriculated]] with good marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christy's teachers, he had been a very intelligent student who always performed very well in sports as well.

==Air Force career==
Christy entered the [[Pakistan Air Force Academy]] in 1955 and graduated from a basic flying training program in 1958. The same year he was sent to the [[PAF Base Rafiqui|Commanders and Combat Flight School]] at [[Shorkot]]. He graduated from there with a specialisation in air weapons system and gained a commission in the air force. Christy began his career in 1962 as a [[Flying officer|flying commission officer]] (FCO). In 1964, FCO Christ was promoted to flight lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistanchristianpost.com/headlinenewsd.php?hnewsid=1889 Ibid of Pakistan Christian Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christy served as a B-57 Canberra [[navigator]] pilot and flew a number of [[Aerial warfare in 1965 India Pakistan War|successful operational missions]] in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war]]. His efforts gained him praise and he was conferred with [[Tamgha-i-Jurat]] by the [[Government of Pakistan]] in 1965 at a public ceremony. In 1968, he was promoted to the rank of [[squadron leader]] in the Air Force.

In December 1971, Christy was on abroad on [[deputation]] with [[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA). While at PIA, he was informed about the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] and volunteered to return to the Pakistan Air Force for war duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the PAF had already selected the teams of fighter pilots to carry out their aerial missions. Undauted, Christy reported to [[Group Captain]] [[Cecil Chaudhry]]. In December 1971, he was selected for bomber aerial operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defencejournal.com/dec98/christian.htm Ibid of Defence Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 1971 at [[GMT-4:00|4:00 o'clock]] in the evening from [[PAF Base Faisal]], he was given a special mission to destroy an [[Indian Air Force]] special [[Military airbase|air station]] located at [[Jamnagar]] because missile attacks had increased from the Indian side and their fighter planes were continuously targeting the PAF flying bases in Karachi.

After attending continuous briefing sessions with his commanders, he, as a [[weapon systems officer]] (WSO) and navigator, along with [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Stephen Israel]] prepared for the mission. The mission codename was "Do-or-Die (DoD)". On 6 December 1971, Christy was detailed as navigator for a bombing mission to Jamnagar. The mission was completed successfully and the Indian Air Force's air station was completed destroyed, but Christy failed to return to base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was widely speculated that his aircraft was shot down by an Indian [[surface-to-air missile]] and that he had been captured. However, after the war, India denied shooting down such an aircraft on 6 December and was unable to track down the pilot. On 8 December, he was officially declared as "[[missing in action]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Philip Anthony Sessarego''' (31 December 1952 – November 2008) was a British soldier, [[adventurer]] and author, who published the best-selling book ''Jihad! - The Secret War in Afghanistan''. His reputation and credibility were damaged by the revelation of false claims in the book, after which he retired from the public spotlight.

==Early life==
Sessarego was born in [[Hereford]], [[Herefordshire]], [[England]], to a farming family.&lt;ref&gt;'My dad the SAS Walter Mitty', 'Daily Mail' 10 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
In 1971 at the age of 18 he enlisted into the [[British Army]] as a [[Gunner (rank)|Gunner]] in the [[Royal Artillery]]. After two years' service in 1973 he applied to join the [[Special Air Service|Special Air Service Regiment]] at the age of 21, which was approved by the Royal Artillery. During [[United Kingdom Special Forces Selection|aptitude trials]] for the S.A.S. he narrowly failed to pass through injury, and was held over in Regiment's training cadre pending physical recovery to try again. After several months with the Regiment's training cadre, he chose to abandon his application to join it, and left the British Army in the mid-1970's.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical profile of "Tom Carew", published on 'Army Rumour Service'. http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/Tom_Carew&lt;/ref&gt;

After the army he worked on the family farm, but grew restless, and subsequently found employment using his military training as a [[mercenary]] soldier, with ex-members of the SAS, seeing service as an advisor to the [[Sri Lankan Army]] in counter-insurgency warfare in 1979, and in [[Afghanistan]]/[[Pakistan]] in the early 1980's with the [[United States Government]]'s [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], training the Afghan [[Mujahideen]] to fight the [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1980's-1990's he was involved in conflicts in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Bosnia War]], [[South America]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;'Death of an SAS fantasist', Daily Mail, 27 January 2009. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1128630/Death-SAS-fantasist-Was-Tom-Carew-murdered--did-fake-death.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Profile of "Tom Carew", Army Rumour Service, http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/Tom_Carew&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, he faked his own death to give the impression that he had been killed by a car bomb in [[Croatia]], possibly trying to get out of paying maintenance to his estranged wife at their family home in Hereford, afterwards breaking off all contact with his family to maintain the ruse and relocating to Belgium, living under the assumed name of "Philip Stevenson". (Sessarego's family continued to believe that he was dead until one evening in late 2001 they saw him being interviewed as a published author and military expert on a British national television evening news show under the pseudonym of "Tom Carew").&lt;ref&gt;'My dad, the SAS Walter Mitty', 'Daily Mail, 10 October 2009. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1219325/My-dad-SAS-Walter-Mitty-How-Claire-mourned-fathers-death-seven-years-seeing-ALIVE-television.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Jihad!'' (2000)==
In 1999, with the assistance of a [[ghost writer]] ([[Adrian Weale]]) Sessargo wrote an account of his military experiences in the [[Afghan-Soviet War]] entitled ''Jihad! - The Secret War in Afghanistan'', which was published in 2000, stating erroneously in its text that he had been in that theatre of operations as a trooper in the Special Air Service. The book sold reasonably well, being serialized in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', with print-runs in several European countries, as well as Australia. A paperback edition was published in 2001. On 11 September 2001 Arabic Jihadist terrorists staged an [[9/11|attack]] within the continental United States of America, hi-jacking several commercial air-liners and suicidally crashing them into key commercial and governmental landmark buildings, and the aftermath of the event created an immense demand for information on the nature and motivation of the attackers, which transferred into a surge in sales of ''Jihad!'' in excess of 50,000 copies, making it a best-seller, and Sessarego (using the [[pen-name]] of "Tom Carew") an in-demand figure in the British media for expert comment on [[Islam|Mohammedan]] [[Jihad]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;'The fantasy life &amp; lonely death of the SAS veteran who never was', 'The Guardian', 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists interviewing him regularly referred to his SAS trooper background in line with the book's text, which Sessarego played along with, until being exposed by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] reporter George Eykyn, after the BBC had been contacted by a former member of the Regiment notifying it that Sessarego's claims in this regard were false. Sessarego was subsequently lured to the BBC on the pretense of an interview about Afghanistan, where, on arrival, he was confronted by Eykyn with a television camera crew in tow aggressively accusing him of being an imposter, who had invented a non-existent career with the Special Air Service.&lt;ref&gt;'Author lied about S.A.S. membership', BBC News, 14 November 2001. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1656661.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Bogus SAS Man, BBC News, 14 November 2001. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/newsnight/1660604.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

After the film of the confrontation was broadcast by the BBC, Sessarego was generally ridiculed in the British media for being a "fantasist", calling into doubt not just his claims to have been a trooper in the SAS but the whole content of ''Jihad!'', his publisher's attempts to defend the book's validity by offering to remove a small part of its text which had made the erroneous claims regarding the Regiment not sufficing in stemming the media's condemnation. The book was withdrawn from further sale, and Sessarego withdrew from the media spotlight, his publishing career at an end.&lt;ref&gt;'The fantasy life &amp; lonely death of the SAS veteran who never was,'The Guardian', 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Sessarego subsequently was reported as living in Belgium in impoverished circumstances selling ex-Army surplus military materials and running "survival" training courses.&lt;ref&gt;'Profile of "Tom Carew", Army Rumour Service. http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/Tom_Carew&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In January 2009, Philip Sessarego's badly decomposed body was found in a rented [[Antwerp]] garage where he had been covertly living for several months. He was 55 years of age. The cause of death was conjectured to be from the effects of accidental [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;'The fantasy life &amp; lonely death of the SAS veteran who never was', 'The Guardian', 24 January 2009. https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jan/24/military-sas-tom-carew-philip-sessarego-jihad&lt;/ref&gt; His body was subsequently cremated, and its ashes buried in the graveyard of St. Martin's Church, in Hereford.

==Personal life==
Sessarego married in 1977, the marriage producing a son and a daughter. A television documentary about his life and family relationships, entitled ''My Father the Mercenary'' was produced in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;'My Father the Mercenary' (2009), Century Films' website. http://www.centuryfilmsltd.com/portfolios/my-father-the-mercenary/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rob Roy''''' is an 1818 play based on the 1817 novel [[Rob Roy (novel)|''Rob Roy'']] by [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j24hAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1260#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |journal=The Green Book Album |date=June 1910 |volume=III |issue=6 |title=The Scotch and the Drama |first=Robert |last=Grey |page=1260 |quote=All except seven of [Walter] Scott's romances were made over into plays, and [[Rob Roy (novel)|''Rob Roy'']] was the most popular of all of them. In 1818 it filled the house for forty-one consecutive nights, which was a great run in those days, and it was a tremendous money-maker. The Scotch people have always been very proud of it, and it is played in Scotland to-day.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian officials have strongly denied the allegations each time they resurfaced. In June 2016, Kremlin spokesman [[Dmitry Peskov]] denied any connection of Russia to the [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks|DNC hacks]],&lt;ref name=russiadenies /&gt; and in October Putin denounced American "hysteria" over "fictional, mythical problems".&lt;ref name=putin-bloomberg /&gt; In December 2016, when [[ABC News]] reported that U.S. intelligence officials told the news agency that Putin was directly involved in the covert operation,&lt;ref name=officialsmasterspy /&gt; Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said he was "astonished" by this "nonsense".&lt;ref name=russianofficialsdeny /&gt;

In January 2017, the Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=ODNI Statement on Declassified Intelligence Community Assessment of Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections|url=https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/224-press-releases-2017/1466-odni-statement-on-declassified-intelligence-community-assessment-of-russian-activities-and-intentions-in-recent-u-s-elections#|date=January 6, 2017|publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413224426/https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/224-press-releases-2017/1466-odni-statement-on-declassified-intelligence-community-assessment-of-russian-activities-and-intentions-in-recent-u-s-elections|archive-date=April 13, 2017|accessdate=May 9, 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the work of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), published the following assessment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.&lt;ref name=RepJan6 /&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2017, Putin told journalists that "patriotically minded" Russian [[Security hacker|hackers]] may have been responsible for the cyberattacks against the U.S. during the election campaign. Putin continued to deny any government involvement, stating, "We're not doing this on the state level."&lt;ref name="HigginsPutinJune1" /&gt;

During a press conference at the [[2018 Russia–United States summit|Helsinki summit]] on 16 July 2018, Putin stated that he wanted Trump to win the 2016 election, because "he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/07/16/trump-dismissed-the-idea-that-putin-wanted-him-to-win-putin-just-admitted-that-he-did/ |title=Trump dismissed the idea that Putin wanted him to win.

=== Intrusions into state voter-registration systems ===
As early as June 2016, the FBI sent a warning to states about "bad actors" probing state-elections systems to seek vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="KopanPoking"&gt;Tal Kopan, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/28/politics/fbi-james-comey-election-cyberattacks/ FBI director: Hackers 'poking around' voter systems], CNN (September 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, FBI Director James Comey testified before the House Judiciary Committee that the FBI was investigating Russian hackers attempting to disrupt the 2016 election and that federal investigators had detected hacker-related activities in [[Voter registration in the United States|state voter-registration]] databases,&lt;ref name="APVoteReg"&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-hackers-target-election-systems-20160930-story.html U.S. official: Hackers targeted voter registration systems of 20 states], Associated Press (September 30, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; which independent assessments determined were soft targets for hackers.&lt;ref name="WindremArkin"&gt;Robert Windrem, William M. Arkin, and Ken Dilanian, [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russians-hacked-two-u-s-voter-databases-say-officials-n639551 Russians Hacked Two U.S. Voter Databases, Officials Say], NBC News (August 30, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Comey stated there were multiple attempts to hack voter database registrations.&lt;ref name="KopanPoking" /&gt; Director of National Intelligence [[James Clapper]] attributed Russian hacking attempts to [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name="LevineThomas"&gt;Mike Levine &amp; Pierre Thomas, [http://abcnews.go.com/US/russian-hackers-targeted-half-states-voter-registration-systems/story?id=42435822 Russian Hackers Targeted Nearly Half of States' Voter Registration Systems, Successfully Infiltrated 4], ABC News (September 29, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the FBI issued a nationwide "flash alert" warning state election officials about hacking attempts.&lt;ref name="WindremArkin" /&gt; In September 2016, U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials and the [[National Association of Secretaries of State]] reported that hackers had penetrated, or sought to penetrate, the voter-registration systems in more than 20 states over the previous few months.&lt;ref name="APVoteReg" /&gt; Federal investigators attributed these attempts to Russian government-sponsored hackers,&lt;ref name="KopanPoking" /&gt; and specifically to Russian intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name="WindremArkin" /&gt; Four of the intrusions into voter registration databases were successful, including intrusions into the Illinois and Arizona databases.&lt;ref name="LevineThomas" /&gt; Although the hackers did not appear to change or manipulate data,&lt;ref name="APVoteReg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KopanPoking" /&gt; Illinois officials reported that information on up to 200,000 registered voters was stolen.&lt;ref name="WindremArkin" /&gt; The FBI and DHS increased their election-security coordination efforts with state officials as a result.&lt;ref name="KopanPoking" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APVoteReg" /&gt; Homeland Security Secretary [[Jeh Johnson]] reported that 18 states had requested voting-system security assistance from DHS.&lt;ref name="KopanPoking" /&gt; The department also offered risk assessments to the states, but just four states expressed interest, as the election was rapidly approaching.&lt;ref name="APVoteReg" /&gt; The reports of the database intrusions prompted alarm from [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]], Democrat of Nevada, who wrote to the FBI saying foreign attempts to cast doubt on [[free and fair elections]] was a danger to democracy not seen since the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="LevineThomas" /&gt;

On September 22, 2017, federal authorities notified the election officials of 21 states that their election systems had been targeted.&lt;ref name="NPR_10/22/17"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fessler|first=Pam|url= https://www.npr.org/2017/09/22/552956517/ten-months-after-election-day-feds-tell-states-more-about-russian-hacking|title=10 Months After Election Day, Feds Tell States More About Russian Hacking|work=NPR|date= September 20, 2017|access-date= September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap9/20/17"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulvihill|first=Geoff|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_RUSSIAN_HACKING_STATES_DCOL-?SITE=OKPON&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|title=The federal government is telling election officials in 21 states that hackers targeted their systems last year, although in most cases the systems were not breached|work=Associated Press|date=September 22, 2017|access-date=September 22, 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a year after the initial warnings, this was the first official confirmation many state governments received that their states specifically had been targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulvihill|first1=Geoff|title=Hackers targeted election voting systems in 21 states, US government reveals|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/us-election-hacking-voting-systems-breach-states-revealed-a7962542.html|website=The Independent|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, top elections officials of the states of Wisconsin and California have rebutted the federal claim. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla stated that "California voters can further rest assured that the [[California Secretary of State]] elections infrastructure and websites were not hacked or breached by Russian cyber actors". "Our notification from DHS last Friday was not only a year late, it also turned out to be bad information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia did not hack our voting systems, says California|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/russia-hacking-us-election-voting-systems-did-not-happen-california-a7970976.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] released its interim report on election security.&lt;ref name="SenateInterimSecurityReport"&gt;Karoun Demirjian, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-intelligence-committee-releases-interim-report-on-election-security/2018/05/08/4b33d992-531e-11e8-9c91-7dab596e8252_story.html Senate Intelligence Committee releases interim report on election security], ''Washington Post'' (May 8, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The committee concluded, on a bipartisan basis, that the response of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] to Russian government-sponsored efforts to undermine confidence in the U.S. voting process was "inadequate". The committee reported that the Russian government was able to penetrate election systems in at least 18, and possibly up to 21, states, and that in a smaller subset of states, infiltrators "could have altered or deleted voter registration data," although they lacked the ability to manipulate individual votes or vote tallies. The committee wrote that the infiltrators' failure to exploit vulnerabilities in election systems could have been because they "decided against taking action" or because "they were merely gathering information and testing capabilities for a future attack".&lt;ref name="SenateInterimSecurityReport" /&gt; To prevent future infiltrations, the committee made a number of recommendations, including that "at a minimum, any machine purchased going forward should have a [[Voter-verified paper audit trail|voter-verified paper trail]] and no WiFi capability".&lt;ref name="SenateInterimSecurityReport" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.burr.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/RussRptInstlmt1-%20ElecSec%20Findings,Recs2.pdf Russian Targeting of Election Infrastructure During the 2016 Election: Summary of Initial Findings and Recommendations], Senate Intelligence Committee, May 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Российский институт стратегических исследований.jpg|alt=three story modern beige office building, gray portico with writing, trees, natural setting|thumb|upright|The [[Russian Institute for Strategic Studies]] began working for the Russian presidency after 2009.]]
In April 2017, [[Reuters]] cited several U.S. officials as saying that the [[Russian Institute for Strategic Studies]] (RISS), which had until January 2017 been headed by a retired [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] general [[Leonid Petrovich Reshetnikov]], had developed a strategy to sway the U.S. election to Donald Trump; in October 2016, when a conclusion was made that Hillary Clinton was likely to win, the strategy was modified and aimed at undermining U.S. voters′ faith in the electoral system.&lt;ref name=Parker /&gt; The development of strategy was allegedly ordered by Putin and directed by former officers of [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian Foreign Intelligence Service]] (SVR). The Institute had been a part of the SVR until 2009, whereafter it has worked for the [[Presidential Administration of Russia|Russian Presidential Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.svoboda.org/a/28440991.html |language=ru |script-title=ru:Трамп и тайные документы Кремля |title=Trump and secret documents of the Kremlin |last1=Lagunina|first1=Irina|last2=Maternaya|first2=Elizabeth|date=April 20, 2017 |publisher=[[Radio Svoboda]] |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to unidentified U.S. officials, the propaganda efforts began in March 2016. The first set of recommendations, issued in June 2016, reportedly proposed that Russia must support a candidate for U.S. president more favorable to Russia than Obama had been via a social media campaign and through Russia-backed news outlets. The second report was written in October 2016 when a Clinton win appeared likely. It allegedly advocated messages about voter fraud in order to undermine the legitimacy of the U.S. electoral system and a Clinton presidency.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-election-exclusive-idUSKBN17L2N3 |title=Exclusive: Putin-linked think tank drew up plan to sway 2016 U.S. election – documents |publisher=[[Reuters]] |last1=Parker |first1=Ned |last2=Landay |first2=Jonathan |last3=Walcott |first3=John |date=April 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; RISS director [[Mikhail Fradkov]] and Kremlin spokesman [[Dmitry Peskov]] denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-election-denial-idUSKBN17M191 |title=Russia denies Reuters report think tank drew up plan to sway U.S. election |publisher=[[Reuters]] |first1=Jack |last1=Stubbs |first2=Denis |last2=Pinchuk |editor-first=Larry |editor-last=King |date=April 21, 2017 |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. intelligence community, in a joint January 6, 2017, declassified report, stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin wished to retaliate against [[Hillary Clinton]] due to faulting her for 2011–2012 [[2011–13 Russian protests|mass protests]] against him.&lt;ref name=RepJan6 /&gt;{{rp|11}} On March 20, 2017, FBI Director [[James Comey]] testified that Putin disliked Clinton and preferred her opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-factbox-idUSKBN16R229|publisher=[[Reuters]]|title=Key quotes from Congress' hearing on Russia and the U.S. election|date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putin repeatedly accused Clinton, who served as U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, of interfering in [[Politics of Russia|Russia's internal affairs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Englund|first=Will|title=The roots of the hostility between Putin and Clinton |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/the-roots-of-the-hostility-between-putin-and-clinton/2016/07/28/85ca74ca-5402-11e6-b652-315ae5d4d4dd_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 28, 2016|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2016, Clinton accused Putin of having a personal grudge against her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/the-top-four-reasons-vladimir-putin-might-have-a-grudge-against-hillary-clinton "The top four reasons Vladimir Putin might have a grudge against Hillary Clinton"].

[[John Podesta]], Chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, received an email on March 19, 2016, alerting him of a "compromise in the system". The Google alert prompted him to change his password "immediately" by clicking on a link. According to Podesta, an IT employee mistakenly told his assistant that the email was "legitimate", when in fact he meant to write "illegitimate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/27/politics/russia-dnc-hacking-csr/index.html |title=How one typo let Russian hackers in|last=Sciutto |first=Jim|date=June 28, 2017|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon clicking the [[phishing]] email, Russian hackers were able to access around 60,000 emails from Podesta's private account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/dnc-hillary-clinton-emails-hacked-russia-aide-typo-investigation-finds|title=Top Democrat's emails hacked by Russia after aide made typo, investigation finds |last=Harding|first=Luke|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2016, less than an hour after ''[[The Washington Post]]'' released the [[Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording]] ''Access Hollywood'' tape, WikiLeaks announced on Twitter that it was in possession of 50,000 of Podesta's emails.

Senior national spokesman for the Clinton campaign, Glen Caplin, said: "We are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange [of WikiLeaks] who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton. [[Guccifer 2.0]] has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign." According to US intelligence officials, the hackers gave the email cache to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/wikileaks-hillary-clinton-paid-wall-street-speeches|title=WikiLeaks releases what appear to be Clinton's paid Wall Street speeches|last=Smith|first=David|date=October 8, 2016 |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cache included emails containing transcripts of Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street banks, controversial comments from staffers about Catholic voters, infighting among employees of the Clinton campaign, as well as potential Vice-Presidential picks for Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37639370|title=18 revelations from Wikileaks' hacked Clinton emails|publisher=Reuters|date=October 27, 2017 |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/07/politics/one-year-access-hollywood-russia-podesta-email/index.html|title=Access Hollywood, Russian hacking and the Podesta emails: One year later |last=Cohen|first=Marshall|date=October 7, 2017 |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 8, the US government formally accused Russia of hacking the DNC's computer networks to interfere in the 2016 US Presidential Election with the help of organizations like WikiLeaks.

I didn't know what they had, what they didn't have. It wasn't until October 7 when [WikiLeaks' Julian] Assange ... started dumping them out and said they would all dump out, that's when I knew that they had the contents of my email account."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/john-podesta-fbi-spoke-me-only-once-about-my-hacked-n697511|title=John Podesta: FBI Spoke to Me Only Once About My Hacked Emails|last=Johnstone|first=Liz|date=December 18, 2017 |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part because U.S. agencies cannot surveil U.S. citizens without a warrant, the U.S. was slow to recognize a pattern itself. From late 2015 until the summer of 2016, during routine surveillance of Russians, several countries discovered interactions between the Trump campaign and Moscow.

==== Russia's reprisals ====
On December 30, 2016, commenting on his eventual decision to refrain from retaliatory measures to actions by the U.S. on December 29, Putin released a published statement that his government, while reserving its legitimate right to respond adequately, would not take action at that time; he also invited all the children of the U.S. diplomats accredited in Russia to New Year's and Christmas celebrations at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]. The statement went on to say that further steps for restoring Russian-American relations would be built on the basis of the policies developed by the [[Cabinet of Donald Trump|Trump administration]].&lt;ref name="stage-management"&gt;{{cite news |last1=MacFarquhar|first1=Neil|title=Vladimir Putin Won't Expel U.S. Diplomats as Russian Foreign Minister Urged |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/world/europe/russia-diplomats-us-hacking.html|work=The New York Times |date=December 30, 2016 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tass.com/world/923649 "Plane with Russian diplomats expelled from US lands in Moscow"].

Upon Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2017, he appointed Flynn his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]. On January 24, Flynn was interviewed by the FBI.

=== George Papadopoulos ===
In March 2016 Donald Trump named [[George Papadopoulos]], an oil, gas, and policy consultant, as an unpaid foreign policy advisor to his campaign.

A June 2017 [[NBC News]]/''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' poll found that respondents were more likely to believe [[James Comey]] over Trump when it came to their differing accounts behind the reasons for Comey's dismissal. The survey reported that "forty-five percent of respondents said that they were more likely to believe Comey's version of events from his [[Dismissal of James Comey#Congressional testimony|June 8 testimony to the U.S. Senate]], versus 22% who were more likely to believe what Trump has said." The poll also found that the number of respondents disapproving of Trump's decision to fire Comey- 46%- was higher than when the same question was asked in May of the same year. 53% of respondents said that they believed that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, however the number changes by party affiliation. 78% of Democrats said that they believed there was interference, versus 26% of Republicans who agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-more-americans-believe-comey-over-trump-n776006|title=Poll: More Americans Believe Comey Over Trump|author=Mark Murray|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[NPR]]/[[PBS NewsHour]]/[[Marist Poll|Marist College]] poll conducted in late June 2017 found that 54% of respondents believed that Trump either did "something illegal" or "something unethical, but not illegal" in his dealings with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]]. The poll reported that "seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump himself has done nothing wrong" while 41% of Democrats believed that Trump did something that was illegal.

Prior to his presidential run, Donald Trump made statements to [[Fox News]] in 2014 in which he agreed with an assessment by then FBI director James Comey about hacking against the U.S. by Russia and China.&lt;ref name=bigproblem&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/19/politics/kfile-trump-russia-hacking/|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=Trump said in 2014 that Russian hacking was a 'big problem'|first= Andrew |last=Kaczynski|date=December 19, 2016 |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump was played a clip of Comey from ''[[60 Minutes]]'' discussing the dangers of cyber attacks.&lt;ref name=bigproblem /&gt; Trump stated he agreed with the problem of cyber threats posed by China, and went on to emphasize there was a similar problem towards the U.S. posed by Russia.&lt;ref name=bigproblem /&gt;

During the third debate, Trump rejected Clinton's claim that Putin favored Trump.&lt;ref name="Blake_10/19/2016" /&gt; Trump's words "our country has no idea" and "I doubt it" were deeply shocking to the British because "all [[NATO]] allies" and "all of America's intelligence agencies" were "sure Russia was behind the hacking".

Hayden goes further and alleges that Trump is a "[[useful idiot|useful fool]]...manipulated by Moscow". First he quotes former CIA Director [[Michael Morell]] and then offers his own view:

{{quote| We have really never seen anything like this. Former acting CIA director Michael Morell says that Putin has cleverly recruited Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.

I'd prefer another term drawn from the arcana of the Soviet era: polezni durak. That's the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but whose blind support is happily accepted and exploited.

That's a pretty harsh term, and Trump supporters will no doubt be offended.

At the [[Valdai Discussion Club]] forum in October 2016, Putin denounced American "hysteria" over alleged Russian interference.&lt;ref name=putin-bloomberg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/putin-says-u-s-isn-t-banana-republic-should-get-over-itself |title=Putin Says U.S. Isn't Banana Republic, Must Get Over Itself |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |first1=Anton |last1=Doroshev |first2=Ilya |last2=Arkhipov |date=October 27, 2016 |accessdate= February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his December 23 press conference, Putin deflected questions on the issue by accusing the U.S. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] of scapegoating Russia after losing the presidential election. He also remarked that the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] won control of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] in [[United States elections, 2016|state elections]] and wondered if Russia was deemed responsible for this as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Filipov|first1=David|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/trump-syria-hacking-and-terrorism-in-play-as-russias-putin-meets-the-press/2016/12/23/28ead25a-c878-11e6-acda-59924caa2450_story.html|title=Putin to Democratic Party: You lost, get over it|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 23, 2016|accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, it was reported that there was a purge of suspected traitors underway in [[Russian Intelligence Community|Russia's intelligence apparatus]] that mainly targeted computer security professionals, the arrested men being charged "with [[Treason#Russia|treason]] in favor of the United States"; experts speculated that those arrested might have provided the U.S. government with information that allowed the U.S. intelligence officials to accuse Russia of using hackers to try influence the 2016 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pagliery|first1=Jose|last2=Chance|first2=Matthew|last3=Burrows|first3=Emma|title=Russian spy purge after suspected leaks to U.S. intelligence|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/01/news/fsb-kaspersky-arrests/|accessdate=July 18, 2017|agency=CNN|date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kramer|first1=Andrew E.|title=Top Russian Cybercrimes Agent Arrested on Charges of Treason|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/world/europe/sergei-mikhailov-russian-cybercrimes-agent-arrested.html|accessdate=July 18, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="radio_liberty"&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-fsb-arrests-spy-scandal-snowballs/28270682.html Moscow Spy Scandal Snowballs: What We Know] [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], January 31, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Putin told journalists in St. Petersburg that "patriotically minded" Russian hackers could have been responsible for the cyberattacks against the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, while continuing to deny government involvement. Putin said that hackers "are like artists" stating: "If they are patriotically minded, they start making their contributions—which are right, from their point of view—to the fight against those who say bad things about Russia. Putin continued to deny Russian government involving, stating, "We're not doing this on the state level."&lt;ref name="HigginsPutinJune1" /&gt; Putin's comments echoed similar remarks that he had made earlier the same week to the French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]''.&lt;ref name="HigginsPutinJune1" /&gt;

In a March 2018 interview, Putin suggested that "[[Ukrainians]], [[Tatar]]s or Jews" rather than [[ethnic Russians]] were to blame for interfering with U.S. elections, and suggested that "maybe it was the Americans who paid them for this work".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Smith, [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-u-s-election-interference-i-couldn-t-care-less-n855151 Alexan Putin on U.S. election interference: 'I couldn't care less'], NBC News (March 10, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/03/10/putin-says-jews-russian-citizenship-could-behind-u-s-election-meddling/413321002/ Putin says Jews, Ukrainians, Tatars could be behind U.S. election meddling], Associated Press (March 10, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Putin's statement was criticized by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[American Jewish Committee]], which both likened Putin's comments to the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', an [[antisemitic]] hoax first published in Russia in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Alana Abramson, [http://time.com/5194830/vladimir-putin-jews-tatars-ukrainians-u-s-election-interference/ Putin Criticized for Remarks Insinuating Jews and Other Minority Groups Could Be Behind U.S. Election Interference], ''Time'' (March 11, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avi Selk, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/03/11/putin-condemned-for-saying-jews-may-have-manipulated-u-s-election/ Putin condemned for saying Jews may have manipulated U.S. election], ''Washington Post'' (March 11, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jon Huntsman ===
On September 19, 2017, at his Senate confirmation hearing, [[Jon Huntsman Jr.]], Trump's nominee for [[United States Ambassador to Russia]], stated: "There is no question, underline no question, that the Russian government interfered in the U.S. election last year."&lt;ref name="Zengerle 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Zengerle | first=Patricia | title=Trump choice for Russia ambassador: 'No question' Russia meddled | website=Reuters | date=September 19, 2017 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-diplomacy-russia/trump-choice-for-russia-ambassador-no-question-russia-meddled-idUSKCN1BU20V | access-date=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mike Pompeo ===
On October 19, 2017, CIA Director [[Mike Pompeo]] spoke at an event hosted by the [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]]. There he stated that the "intelligence community's assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election". The statement was at odds with a report released in January by the Director of National Intelligence, which stated that the intelligence community did "not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election".

The next day, October 20, CIA agency spokesman Dean Boyd responded with a revision to Pompeo's remarks: "The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed, and the director did not intend to suggest that it had."&lt;ref name="Cohen_Sciutto_10/20/2017"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Cohen | first1=Zachary | last2=Sciutto | first2=Jim | date=October 20, 2017 | title=CIA corrects director's Russian election meddling claim | website=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/19/politics/cia-pompeo-russia-meddling-election/index.html | accessdate=October 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth season of the American [[animated sitcom]] ''[[South Park]]'' premiered on [[Comedy Central]] on September 14, 2016 and ended on December 7, 2016, containing ten episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/south-park/254294/south-park-season-20-release-date-and-new-clips|last=Longo|first=Chris|date=September 13, 2016|title=South Park Season 20 Release Date and New Clips|publisher=denofgeek.com|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most seasons of the show, all episodes are written and directed by series co-creator and co-star [[Trey Parker]].

Like the previous two seasons, this season features an episode-to-episode continuity, but unlike the previous two, the continuity is more linear, as if the whole season is one story arc. This season featured recurring themes focusing on [[Internet troll]]s, [[nostalgia]], and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]]. 

This season also had planned "dark weeks", weeks where no new episodes would air, which has been done since [[South Park (season 19)|the 19th season]]. These were after episode three, episode six, and episode eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes|title=Watch Full Episodes of South Park online|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
To promote the season, Comedy Central had mobile billboards placed in key locations in seven cities around the United States. Each billboard featured an image from the series that bore a connection to the location in which it was placed.&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter&gt;Parker, Ryan (September 27, 2016). [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/south-park-irks-white-house-scientology-mobile-billboards-933121 "'South Park' Irks White House, Scientology With Trolling Mobile Billboards"]. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[Los Angeles]], a billboard was placed in front of the [[Church_of_Scientology#Headquarters, Bases, and Central Orgs|headquarters]] of the [[Church of Scientology]], which was parodied in the controversial 2005 episode "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]".&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter/&gt;
*In [[Washington, D.C.]], a billboard was placed in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and the [[White House]]. It featured Barack and Michelle Obama, whose relationship was parodied in the 2008 episode "[[About Last Night... (South Park)|About Last Night...]]"&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter/&gt;
*In [[Lakewood, Colorado]], a billboard was placed in front of the city's [[Casa Bonita]] restaurant, which was a central plot point of the 2003 episode "[[Casa Bonita (South Park)|Casa Bonita]]".&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter/&gt;
*In [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], a billboard was placed in front of the [[Church Office Building|headquarters]] of the [[LDS Church]], which was parodied in the 2003 episode "[[All About Mormons]]".&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter/&gt;
*In [[Menlo Park, California]], a billboard was placed in front of the headquarters of [[Facebook]], which was parodied in the 2010 episode "[[You Have 0 Friends]]".&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter/&gt;
*In [[New York City]], a billboard was placed in front of the campaign headquarters of [[Donald Trump]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], whose [[United States presidential election, 2016|presidential campaigns]] were parodied in this season's premiere "[[Member Berries]]", and "[[Where My Country Gone?]]"&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter/&gt;
*In [[Buffalo, New York]], a billboard was placed in front at the United States' border with Canada, whose culture and relationship with the United States has been parodied in the feature film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'', and various episodes such as "[[Royal Pudding]]" and "Where My Country Gone?"&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter/&gt;

All of the billboards included the caption "We've Been There." In some of the locations, personnel of the organizations were displeased to have the billboards outside their locations and asked the billboard operators to leave, including the Los Angeles and both Washington, D.C landmarks. Comedy Central's Chief Marketing Officer Walter Levitt stated, "That was all expected, and we completely understand why. We knew it was risky. We did this stunt because we thought it was a great way to remind ''South Park'' fans of all the amazing moments of the past 19 seasons and truly a perfect way to celebrate the 20th season."&lt;ref name=HollywoodReporter/&gt;

==Reception==
Jesse Schedeen with [[IGN]] rated the entire season a 8.4 out of 10, noting "Season 20 proved that ''South Park'' has lost none of its edge over the years, as the show targeted everything from [[Donald Trump]] to the dangerous allure of nostalgia. Though the finale failed to properly tie everything together, ''South Park''{{'}}s ability to adapt and course-correct to real-world developments served it well this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/south-park-season-20-review|title=South Park: Season 20 Review - IGN|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|website=[[IGN]]|date=December 15, 2016|access-date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An illustrated catalogue, titled ''[[The Last Harvest: Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore (book)|The Last Harvest: Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore]]'', with essays by international Tagore experts was published to accompany the exhibition. The book covered Tagore's art and other aspects of his work and life.

{{Quote box|quote=The inclination to know and understand other cultures was innate to his personality, and contributed to his emergence as an artist. A world traveler and a creative artist with interest in cross-cultural contacts, he looked at the art of the countries he travelled to. Sometimes he did this with greater purposefulness and self-awareness, as he did during his 1916 visit to Japan. But often he merely absorbed them, and without discussion or record allowed them to sink to the bottom of his awareness, from where they subliminally guided his thoughts and rose to the surface when required. Primitive and modern art that he saw during his many travels abroad played such a role in his emergence as an artist.|source= —[[R.

==''The Last Harvest''==

[[File:Art historian R. Siva Kumar accompanies the Culture Minister of India.jpg|thumb|Art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]] accompanies the Culture Minister of India]]
Surrounded by several painters Rabindranath had always wanted to paint. Writing and music, playwriting and acting came to him naturally and almost without training, as it did to several others in his family, and in even greater measure. But painting eluded him. Yet he tried repeatedly to master the art and there are several references to this in his early letters and reminiscence. In 1900 for instance, when he was nearing forty and already a celebrated writer, he wrote to Jagadishchandra Bose, "You will be surprised to hear that I am sitting with a sketchbook drawing. Needless to say, the pictures are not intended for any salon in Paris, they cause me not the least suspicion that the national gallery of any country will suddenly decide to raise taxes to acquire them. But, just as a mother lavishes most affection on her ugliest son, so I feel secretly drawn to the very skill that comes to me least easily." He also realized that he was using the eraser more than the pencil, and dissatisfied with the results he finally withdrew, deciding it was not for him to become a painter.

Although he gave up the hope of becoming an artist around 1900, Rabindranath continued to doodle in his manuscripts. He turned struck-out words into ornamental motifs and sometimes linked the scratched out words on the pages of his manuscripts into an art-nouveau-like arabesque. This continued without much change until the end of 1923. Then almost all of a sudden on the pages of the notebook he used during his tour of 1924 his doodles proliferated and assumed more representational and expressive intent. Victoria Ocampo who spotted these during his stay in Argentina as her guest was impressed and found artistic merit in them. "He played with erasures," she wrote, "following them from verse to verse with his pen, making lines that suddenly jumped into life out of this play: prehistoric monsters, birds, faces appeared."

[[File:Professor R. Siva Kumar Explains Tagore's Painting.jpg|thumb|Art Historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], the curator of the show explains [[Tagore]]'s Painting]]
These doodles in the Purabi manuscript that excited Ocampo in 1924 mark the beginnings of Rabindranath"s artistic career. Rabindrnath himself recognised such doodles as the beginnings of his art and wrote: "The only training I had from my young days was the training in rhythm in thought, the rhythm in sound. I had come to know that rhythm gives reality to that which is desultory, which is insignificant in itself. And therefore, when the scratches in my manuscript cried, like sinners, for salvation, and assailed my eyes with the ugliness of their irrelevance, I often took more time in rescuing them into a merciful finality of rhythm than in carrying on what was my obvious task." He also called this his "unconscious training in drawing." And described the imagery that emerged as follows: "... when the vagaries of the ostracized mistakes had their conversion into rhythmic inter-relationship, giving birth to unique forms and characters. Some assumed the temperate exaggeration of a probable animal that had unaccountably missed its chance of existence… Some lines showed anger, some placid benevolence, through some lines ran an essential laughter. ... These lines often expressed passions that were abstract, evolved characters that hung upon subtle suggestions."

After four years of involved doodling, Rabindranath began to do independent paintings in 1928. And six years after she first noticed the expressive strength of his doodles in 1930 Ocampo helped him organize the first exhibition of his paintings in Paris. This was followed by a string of exhibitions across Europe, in Russia, England and America. He was the first Indian artist to be exhibited widely in the West. He felt that different as his works were from the art of his Indian contemporaries they stood a better chance to be appreciated in the West. And many of his first viewers in the West, and these included seasoned artists and connoisseurs, were appreciative. However, they were fleeting encounters and they saw his work as an extension of Western art and not in relation to the totality of his oeuvre or in relation to India. His familiarity with the "primitive" and modern traditions of art played a role in his emergence as a painter. But it is only in the context of post-forties Indian art that Rabindranath's paintings find their true place in the history of modernism and it is in this context they need to be looked at.

Though Rabindranath began to paint only in 1928 when he was sixty-seven he painted well over two thousand paintings. It was as Abanindranath Tagore said a "volcanic eruption" that continued unabated for the last thirteen years of his life. Coming at the end of a hugely creative life spreading across six decades and involving work in several mediums and genres the question of how his paintings relate to the rest of his oeuvre rises. Is there a unifying theme or universal "truth" running through all his creations? It would be difficult to give a categorical and simple answer but the following words of Rabindranath from My Pictures, a statement he made in 1930 in connection with his paintings might contain a lead.

"But one thing which is common to all arts is the principle of rhythm which transforms inert materials into living creations. My instinct for it and my training in its use led me to know that lines and colours in art are no carriers of information; they seek their rhythmic incarnation in pictures. Their ultimate purpose is not to illustrate or to copy some outer fact or inner vision, but to evolve a harmonious wholeness which finds its passage through our eyesight into imagination. It neither questions our mind for meaning nor burdens it with unmeaningness, for it is, above all, meaning."

==Organizational theme of the exhibition==

[[File:Installation team at V&amp;A.JPG|thumb|Installation team at V&amp;A]]
''The Last Harvest'' is an international exhibition commissioned and fully supported by the Government of India as part of Rabindranath's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It brings together a representative selection of his works culled from the collections of Rabindra Bhavana and [[Kala Bhavana]] at Santiniketan, and the National Gallery of Modern Art.

Rabindranath's life, his works and the history of his institutions mark a progress from nationalism to universal humanism. His paintings belong to the period of universal humanism and linked as they may be to personal experiences they have a universal appeal. In consonance with it Rabindranath did not title his drawings and paintings. He also did not date most of them. Thus they come to us as an open-ended oeuvre, encouraging us to respond to them with our sensibilities and find linkages between them. In other words, he encourages the viewers to embark on a curatorial process. This exhibition is one such effort.

In this exhibition the works are grouped into what may be considered four important facets of his oeuvre. His earliest paintings grew out of the doodles he did in his manuscripts while attempting to turn crossed out words and discarded lines into visually exciting motifs. These have an element of playful inventiveness and involve morphological cross-projections that defy perceptual experience. If the subliminal played an important part in his first paintings, painting itself led him to pay attention to the pageant of forms in nature. The landscapes included in these selections are a token of this shift. As he progressed he also began to see the human body not merely as form but as gestures carrying within them the seeds of visual narration and theatre – ambivalent as they may remain without the benefit of names. A third group of paintings bring this into focus. And finally there are his representations of the human face; hovering between hieratic masks and individualised portraits, they turn countenance into characters.

The four groups may be highlighted thus:

Group 1 This group contains some of his earliest paintings, they are either geometrical or arabesque and have an element of playful inventiveness involving morphological cross-projections that defy reality.

Group 2 Nature was an enduring theme in Rabindranath's writings and songs, he felt a deep companionship with nature since his childhood. A more meditative and observant come through in his landscapes and flower pieces.

Group 3 As a playwright and actor Rabindranath was sensitive to gesture and its dramatic and narrative potential; the paintings in this group bring this into focus.

Group 4 This group consists of his representations of the human face into which he reads traces of social and personal life. They are products of observation and psychological probing.

Finally a word about the title. For Rabindranath who welcomed contact with other cultures to foster creativity, and for whom the touchstone of authenticity was not the lineage of one"s language but one"s ability to make it one"s own, the value of art lay not in its source or style but in being an imperative of life.

And painting was the last enchantment of his life, his last personal imperative. "I am hopelessly entangled in the spell that the lines have cast all around me…. If I were a free agent ... unburdened by any care," he wrote to close friend in 1928 just when he was embarking on his career as a painter, "I would live by the Padma and gather a harvest of pictures and nothing but pictures to load the Golden Boat of Time with." He was burdened with too many commitments to allow himself that privilege but the harvest has been good (well over two thousand paintings in thirteen years) and this exhibition carries a small part of it eighty years after he himself had ferried it across the world for the first time.

==Reception==
''The Last Harvest'' received highly appreciable reviews across the globe. The British newspaper ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported,"Tagore is such a fascinating figure that for the fans of his work the art will illuminate his poems and fictions; and for those coming cold, this (''The Last Harvest'') serves as a delightful introduction." ''[[The Independent]]'' rated the exhibition as one of the five best shows 
to have opened in London in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://ngmaindia.gov.in/pdf/NGMA-E-newsletter-option17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Mumbai Boss declared it the best museum exhibition saying, "At this gathering of about 100 works, one of the largest since his death, fluidly curated by historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], the viewer was given a peek into a less assured Tagore, as a 60-something artist, who used his innate sense of linguistic artistry to permeate his at-times fantastical works. There were animals invented, idyllic landscapes, portraits and drawings that showed him to have an astonishing grasp of what it meant to endow a visual expression with the same raw beauty as its written equivalent."&lt;ref&gt;http://mumbaiboss.com/2013/12/23/best-of-mumbai-2013-culture/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daily News and Analysis]] reported, "Tagore's imagination created paintings that underline his sheer genius. Yet, they were untitled, left to viewers to interpret." According to ''[[The Times of India]]'',  ''The Last Harvest'' was "A rare display of artworks by Tagore". "Like a skipping stone, Tagore’s style glanced off a variety of inspirations – wood-cuts, surrealist imagery, North American folk art – and yet was sharply distinctive. ''The Last Harvest'', curated by Professor [[Raman Siva Kumar]] of Visva-Bharati University, presents one of the most elaborate exhibitions of Tagore’s paintings that we’ve seen." reported [[Firstpost]].

The '''Vienna International Film Festival''', or '''Viennale''', is a [[film festival]] taking place every October since 1960 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].
The average number of visitors is about 75,000. Traditional cinema venues are ''Gartenbaukino'', ''Urania'', ''Metro-Kino'', ''Filmmuseum'' and ''Stadtkino''. At the end of the festival, the ''Vienna Film Prize'' is awarded.

[[Image:Viennale-04-Stadtkino.jpg|thumb|190px|right| The ''Stadtkino'' during the Viennale 2004]]
The festival features a collection of new films from all over the world, as well as national and international [[premiere]]s. Apart from new feature films in various [[film genre]]s, the festival focuses on [[documentary film]]s, [[short film]]s, [[experimental film]]s and crossover productions. Together with the ''Austrian Film Museum'', a historical [[retrospective]] is organized every year, as well as special programs, tributes and homages to international institutions and individuals.

During the festival, the ''[[FIPRESCI|Fipresci]] Prize'' is awarded by international [[film critic]]s. Another prize is awarded by the readers of the Austrian [[newspaper]] ''[[Der Standard]]''.

The program of the festival includes galas, special events and celebrations, as well as discussions and meetings between international guests and local visitors.

The Vienna International Film Festival is different from the ''Film Festival Rathausplatz'' in central Vienna, which exclusively shows music films daily throughout August.
