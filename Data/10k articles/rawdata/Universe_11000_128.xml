      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2064">'''Alata River''' ({{Lang-tr|Alata çayı}}) is small river in [[Erdemli]] [[ilçe]] (district) of [[Mersin Province]], [[Turkey]]

==Geography==
The headwaters are around the village of [[Toros, Erdemli|Toros (Küçüksorgun)]] in the [[Toros Mountains]] at an altitude of about {{convert|1500|m}}. In the upper reaches it is usually called  Sorgun Creek ({{lang-tr|Sorgun Çayı}}). Flowing to south for {{convert|90|km}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csb.gov.tr/db/ced/editordosya/Mersin_icdr2012.pdf Ministry of Environment page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; it  empties into the Mediterranean sea at {{coord|36|36|13|N|34|19|10|E}}. Presently the estuary is in the urban fabric of Erdemli.

==History==
According to the 1892 map drawn by [[Vital Cuinet]] and the 1897-[[salname]] (provencial annual) of Adana, Alata  was the border line between [[Mersin]] and İçil [[sanjak]]s (which were later merged with).&lt;ref&gt;İbrahim Bozkur-Birgül Bozkurt-Sırma Hasgül: ''Salname'i Vilayet'i Adana'', {{ISBN|978-605-83847-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the estuary there was an active commercial pier. According to researcher Mehmet Mazak, during 1880-1920 term, Alata pier was the only Mediterranean pier between Mersin and [[Taşucu]] piers. Presently there is only a small fishing pier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inovatifhaber.com/yazar/osmanli-donemi-erdemli-alata-iskelesi-1733.html Mehmet Mazak in Inovatif news {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroeectric power plant==

A dam on the Alata River under the supervision of Turkish [[State Hydraulic Works]] is under construction. The dam will serve for irrigation as well as energy production. The altitude of the rockfill dam is {{convert|1290|m}}. 52410 decare of land will be irrigated and 37678 GW-hour of electric energy will be produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.gov.tr/haberler/2013/12/12/sorgunbarajindaimzalaratildi State Hydraulic Works page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5207">'''Bulk density''' is a property of [[powder (substance)|powder]]s, [[granular material|granules]], and other "divided" [[solid]]s, especially used in reference to [[mineral]] components ([[soil]], [[gravel]]), [[chemical substance]]s, ([[pharmaceutical]]) [[ingredient]]s, foodstuff, or any other masses of corpuscular or [[Granular material|particulate matter]].  It is defined as the [[mass]] of many [[particle]]s of the material divided by the total [[volume]] they occupy.  The total volume includes particle volume, inter-particle void volume, and internal pore volume.&lt;ref&gt;Page 50 ''in'' {{Citation
  | last = Buckman | first = Harry O. | last2 = Brady | first2 = Nyle C. | title = The Nature and Property of Soils - A College Text of Edaphology | place = New York | publisher = Macmillan Publishers, New York, NY | year = 1960 | edition = 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulk [[density]] is not an intrinsic property of a material; it can change depending on how the material is handled.  For example, a powder poured into a cylinder will have a particular bulk density; if the cylinder is disturbed, the powder particles will move and usually settle closer together, resulting in a higher bulk density.  For this reason, the bulk density of powders is usually reported both as "freely settled" (or "poured" density) and "tapped" density (where the tapped density refers to the bulk density of the powder after a specified compaction process, usually involving vibration of the container.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.powderprocess.net/bulk_density.html|title=Powder Bulk Density - Bulk Solids density - Bulk Powder Properties - Powder Loose Density - Powder tapped density - PowderProcess.net|website=www.powderprocess.net|language=en|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Soil==
The bulk density of soil depends greatly on the mineral make up of soil and the degree of [[Soil compaction|compaction]].  The density of [[quartz]] is around 2.65 g/cm³ but the (dry) bulk density of a mineral soil is normally about half that density, between 1.0 and 1.6 g/cm³. Soils high in organics and some friable clay may have a bulk density well below 1 g/cm³. The reason why soils rich in soil organic carbon do have lower bulk density is due to the low density of organic materials. For instance peat soils have bulk densities of around 0.02&amp;nbsp;g/cm³&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016719879090029D|title=The role of organic matter in soil compactibility: A review of some practical aspects |language=en|access-date=2017-03-27|doi=10.1016/0167-1987(90)90029-D|volume=16|journal=Soil and Tillage Research|pages=179–201 | last1 = Soane | first1 = B.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulk density of soil is usually determined from a [[core sample]] which is taken by driving a metal corer into the soil at the desired depth and horizon.&lt;ref&gt;USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_053256.pdf "Soil quality indicators -- Bulk density"] retrieved December 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a soil sample of known total volume, &lt;math&gt;V_t&lt;/math&gt;. From this sample the wet bulk density and the dry bulk density can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Argonne National Lab [http://web.ead.anl.gov/resrad/datacoll/soildens.htm "RESRAD Data collection handbook, chapter 2 -- Soil density" retrieved May 26, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the wet bulk density (total bulk density) this sample is weighed, giving the mass &lt;math&gt;M_t&lt;/math&gt;. For the dry bulk density, the sample is oven dried and weighed, giving the mass of soil solids, &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt;. The relationship between these two masses is &lt;math&gt;M_t = M_s + M_l&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M_l&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of substances lost on oven drying (often, mostly water).  The dry and wet bulk densities are calculated as

Dry bulk density = mass of soil/ volume as a whole

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_b = \frac{M_s}{V_t}&lt;/math&gt;

Wet bulk density = mass of soil plus liquids/ volume as a whole

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_t = \frac{M_t}{V_t}&lt;/math&gt;

The dry bulk density of a soil is [[Inverse relationship|inversely related]] to the [[porosity]] of the same soil: the more pore space in a soil the lower the value for bulk density.  Bulk density of a region in the interior of the earth is also related to the [[seismic velocity]] of waves travelling through it: for [[P-wave]]s, this has been quantified with [[Gardner's relation]].  The higher the density, the faster the velocity.

[[File:Cascaded Arc Plasma Source.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cascaded Arc Plasma Source]]

The '''cascaded arc''' is a wall-stabilized thermal [[electric arc]] discharge that produces a high density, low temperature [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

== General ==
The cascaded arc source, developed at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://alexandria.tue.nl/repository/freearticles/588632.pdf] G.M.W. Kroesen, D.C. Schram, and J.C.M. de Haas, Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing, 10(4):531–551, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://crppwww.epfl.ch/LTPD99/pdf/invited/vandeSanden.pdf] M.C.M. van de Sanden, G.J.H. Brussaard, W.M.M. Kessels, A. de Graaf, M.F.A.M. van Hest, K.G.Y. Letourneur and D.C. Schram&lt;/ref&gt; is shown in the figure below. Compared to plasma sources in other linear plasma generators, this source can produce high-density argon and hydrogen plasmas (respectively 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) at a relatively low [[electron temperature]] (~1&amp;nbsp;eV). Due to the high collision frequency of the particles in the source, the plasma is in thermal equilibrium and reasonably homogeneous.

The cascaded arc consists of a gas inlet, three [[tungsten]] cathodes, cascaded plates, a nozzle and an anode. Via the gas inlet, the working gas -argon or hydrogen- can flow into the cathode chamber. The source is typically running at 0.5–3.0&amp;nbsp;[[Standard litre per minute|slm]] ({{val|2.2|e=20}}&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;{{val|1.3|e=20}} particles per second&lt;!-- 1 slm = 4.4×10^20 particles per second --&gt;) and a discharge current of 100–300&amp;nbsp;A. The cascaded plates in between the cathode and anode are electrically insulated from each other by 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick [[Boron nitride]] plates. The [[voltage]] of these plates is the floating potential. Both nozzle and anode are grounded.

A '''ceramic capacitor''' is a fixed-value [[capacitor]] in which ceramic material acts as the [[dielectric]]. It is constructed of two or more alternating layers of [[ceramic]] and a [[metal]] layer acting as the [[electrode]]s. The composition of the ceramic material defines the electrical behavior and therefore applications. Ceramic capacitors are divided into two application classes:
* Class 1 ceramic capacitors offer high stability and low losses for resonant circuit applications.
* Class 2 ceramic capacitors offer high [[volumetric efficiency#Electronics|volumetric efficiency]] for buffer, by-pass, and coupling applications.

Ceramic capacitors, especially multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), are the most produced and used capacitors in electronic equipment that incorporate approximately one trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) pieces per year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ho |first1=J. |last2=Jow |first2=T.

Ceramic capacitors of special shapes and styles are used as capacitors for [[Electromagnetic interference|RFI/EMI]] suppression, as feed-through capacitors and in larger dimensions as power capacitors for [[transmitter]]s.

==History==
[[File:Ceramic capacitors.jpg|thumb|300px| Historic ceramic capacitors]]

Since the beginning of the study of [[electricity]] non conductive materials such as [[glass]], [[porcelain]], [[paper]] and [[mica]] have been used as insulators. These materials some decades later were also well-suited for further use as the [[dielectric]] for the first capacitors.

Even in the early years of [[Marconi]]'s wireless transmitting apparatus, porcelain capacitors were used for high voltage and high frequency application in the [[transmitter]]s. On the receiver side, the smaller mica capacitors were used for resonant circuits. Mica dielectric capacitors were invented in 1909 by William Dubilier. Prior to World War II, mica was the most common dielectric for capacitors in the United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Mica is a natural material and not available in unlimited quantities. So in the mid-1920s the deficiency of mica in Germany and the experience in porcelain—a special class of ceramic—led in Germany to the first capacitors using ceramic as dielectric, founding a new family of ceramic capacitors. [[Dielectric#Paraelectricity|Paraelectric]] [[titanium dioxide]] ([[rutile]]) was used as the first ceramic dielectric because it had a linear temperature dependence of capacitance for temperature compensation of resonant circuits and can replace mica capacitors. 1926 these ceramic capacitors were produced in small quantities with increasing quantities in the 1940s. The style of these early ceramics was a disc with metallization on both sides contacted with tinned wires. This style predates the transistor and was used extensively in vacuum-tube equipment (e.g., radio receivers) from about 1930 through the 1950s.

But this paraelectric dielectric had relatively low [[permittivity]] so that only small capacitance values could be realized. The expanding market of radios in the 1930s and 1940s create a demand for higher capacitance values but below electrolytic capacitors for HF decoupling applications. Discovered in 1921, the ferroelectric ceramic material [[barium titanate]] with a [[permittivity]] in the range of 1,000, about ten times greater than titanium dioxide or mica, began to play a much larger role in electronic applications.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Waugh&gt;Mark D. Waugh, Murata, Design solutions for DC bias in multilayer ceramic capacitors [http://www.murata.com/products/article/pdf/pp1008.pdf PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513004531/http://www.murata.com/products/article/pdf/pp1008.pdf |date=May 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher permittivity resulted in much higher capacitance values, but this was coupled with relatively unstable electrical parameters. Therefore, these ceramic capacitors only could replace the commonly used mica capacitors for applications where stability was less important. Smaller dimensions, as compared to the mica capacitors, lower production costs and independence from mica availability accelerated their acceptance.

The fast-growing broadcasting industry after the Second World War drove deeper understanding of the [[crystallography]], phase transitions and the chemical and mechanical optimization of the ceramic materials. Through the complex mixture of different basic materials, the electrical properties of ceramic capacitors can be precisely adjusted. To distinguish the electrical properties of ceramic capacitors, standardization defined several different application classes (Class 1, Class 2, Class 3). It is remarkable that the separate development during the War and the time afterwards in the US and the European market had led to different definitions of these classes (EIA vs IEC), and only recently (since 2010) has a worldwide harmonization to the IEC standardization taken place.

The typical style for ceramic capacitors beneath the disc (at that time called condensers) in radio applications at the time after the War from the 1950s through the 1970s was a ceramic tube covered with tin or silver on both the inside and outside surface. It included relatively long terminals forming, together with resistors and other components, a tangle of open circuit wiring.

The easy-to-mold ceramic material facilitated the development of special and large styles of ceramic capacitors for high-voltage, high-frequency (RF) and power applications

[[File:CPU-Beschaltung-mit MLCC-P1040239-d.jpg|thumb|right|MLCCs as decoupling capacitors around a [[microprocessor]]]]
With the development of [[semiconductor]] technology in the 1950s, barrier layer capacitors, or IEC class 3/EIA class IV capacitors, were developed using [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] ferroelectric ceramics. Because this doped material was not suitable to produce multilayers, they were replaced decades later by Y5V class 2 capacitors.

The early style of the ceramic disc capacitor could be more cheaply produced than the common ceramic tube capacitors in the 1950s and 1970s. An American company in the midst of the [[Apollo program]], launched in 1961, pioneered the stacking of multiple discs to create a monolithic block. This "multi-layer ceramic capacitor" (MLCC) was compact and offered high-capacitance capacitors.&lt;ref name=Murata&gt;[http://www.murata.com/products/article/pp09e1/1.html Murata, Technical Report, Evolving Capacitors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617024132/http://www.murata.com/products/article/pp09e1/1.html |date=June 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these capacitors using the tape casting and ceramic-electrode [[cofiring|cofiring processes]] was a great manufacturing challenge. MLCCs expanded the range of applications to those requiring larger capacitance values in smaller cases. These ceramic chip capacitors were the driving force behind the conversion of electronic devices from [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] mounting to [[surface-mount technology]] in the 1980s. Polarized electrolytic capacitors could be replaced by non-polarized ceramic capacitors, simplifying the mounting.

{{As of|2012}}, more than 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; MLCCs were manufactured each year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Along with the style of ceramic chip capacitors, ceramic disc capacitors are often used as safety capacitors in [[electromagnetic interference]] suppression applications. Besides these, large ceramic power capacitors for high voltage or high frequency transmitter applications are also to be found.

New developments in ceramic materials have been made with anti-ferroelectric ceramics. This material has a nonlinear antiferroelectric/ferroelectric phase change that allows increased energy storage with higher volumetric efficiency. They are used for energy storage (for example, in detonators).&lt;ref&gt;W. Hackenberger, S. Kwon, E.

==Application classes, definitions==
The different ceramic materials used for ceramic capacitors, [[Paraelectricity|paraelectric]] or [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] ceramics, influences the electrical characteristics of the capacitors. Using mixtures of paraelectric substances based on titanium dioxide results in very stable and linear behavior of the capacitance value within a specified temperature range and low losses at high frequencies. But these mixtures have a relatively low [[permittivity]] so that the capacitance values of these capacitors are relatively small.

Higher capacitance values for ceramic capacitors can be attained by using mixtures of ferroelectric materials like barium titanate together with specific oxides. These dielectric materials have much higher permittivities, but at the same time their capacitance value are more or less nonlinear over the temperature range, and losses at high frequencies are much higher. These different electrical characteristics of ceramic capacitors requires to group them into "application classes". The definition of the application classes comes from the standardization. As of 2013, two sets of standards were in use, one from [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and the other from the now-defunct [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] (EIA).

The definitions of the application classes given in the two standards are different. The following table shows the different definitions of the application classes for ceramic capacitors:

&lt;/center&gt;
Manufacturers, especially in the US, preferred [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] (EIA) standards. In many parts very similar to the IEC standard, the EIA RS-198 defines four application classes for ceramic capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;Chroma Technology Co., Ltd., [http://www.chromatechnology.com.tw/images/capacitor/capacitor_3_en.pdf CLASS III –General Purpose High-K Ceramic Disk Capacitors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720123612/http://www.chromatechnology.com.tw/images/capacitor/capacitor_3_en.pdf |date=July 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different class numbers within both standards are the reason for a lot of misunderstandings interpreting the class descriptions in the datasheets of many manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kechome.nsf/vapubfiles/F3101_goldmax.pdf/$file/F3101_goldmax.pdf Kemet: Ceramic leaded Capacitors F-3101F06/05] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010051552/http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kechome.nsf/vapubfiles/F3101_GoldMax.pdf/%24file/F3101_GoldMax.pdf |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ceramic [http://my.execpc.com/~endlr/ceramic.html Ceramic]&lt;/ref&gt; The EIA ceased operations on February 11, 2011, but the former sectors continue to serve international standardization organizations.

In the following, the definitions of the IEC standard will be preferred and in important cases compared with the definitions of the EIA standard.

===Class 1 ceramic capacitors===
Class 1 ceramic capacitors are accurate, temperature-compensating capacitors. They offer the most stable voltage, temperature, and to some extent, frequency. They have the lowest losses and therefore are especially suited for resonant circuit applications where stability is essential or where a precisely defined temperature coefficient is required, for example in compensating temperature effects for a circuit. The basic materials of class 1 ceramic capacitors are composed of a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric materials such as [[Titanium dioxide]] ({{chem|Ti|O|2}}), modified by additives of Zinc, Zirconium, Niobium, Magnesium, Tantalum, Cobalt and Strontium, which are necessary to achieve the capacitor's desired linear characteristics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Otto Zinke|Surname2=Hans Seither|Title=Widerstände, Kondensatoren, Spulen und ihre Werkstoffe |Edition=2.|Publisher=Springer|PublicationPlace=Berlin|Year=2002|Date=  2002|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Lee, J. Yang, T. Yang, C. Y. Su, Y. L. Hu, Yageo: In: ''Passive Components Industry'', 2004, page 26ff [http://ws.elance.com/file/PCI_May-June04_copy.pdf?crypted=Y3R4JTNEcG9ydGZvbGlvJTI2ZmlkJTNEMjQzMjU3MjMlMjZyaWQlM0QtMSUyNnBpZCUzRDI0NzE3OTU= Ultra High-Q NP0 MLCC with Ag inner Electrode for Telecommunication Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

The general capacitance temperature behavior of class 1 capacitors depends on the basic paraelectric material, for example {{chem|Ti|O|2}}. The additives of the chemical composition are used to adjust precisely the desired temperature characteristic.
Class 1 ceramic capacitors have the lowest [[volumetric efficiency]] among ceramic capacitors. This is the result of the relatively low [[permittivity]] (6 to 200) of the paraelectric materials. Therefore, class 1 capacitors have capacitance values in the lower range.

&lt;/center&gt;

Class 1 capacitors have a temperature coefficient that is typically fairly linear with temperature. These capacitors have very low electrical losses with a dissipation factor of approximately 0.15%. They undergo no significant aging processes and the capacitance value is nearly independent of the applied voltage. These characteristics allow applications for high Q filters, in resonant circuits and oscillators (for example, in [[phase-locked loop]] circuits).

The EIA RS-198 standard codes ceramic class 1 capacitors with a three character code that indicates temperature coefficient. The first letter gives the significant figure of the change in capacitance over temperature (temperature coefficient α) in [[Parts-per notation|ppm/K]]. The second character gives the multiplier of the temperature coefficient. The third letter gives the maximum tolerance from that in ppm/K. All ratings are from 25 to 85&amp;nbsp;°C:

In addition to the EIA code, the temperature coefficient of the capacitance dependence of class 1 ceramic capacitors is commonly expressed in ceramic names like "NP0", "N220" etc. These names include the temperature coefficient (α). In the IEC/EN 60384-8/21 standard, the temperature coefficient and tolerance are replaced by a two digit letter code (see table) in which the corresponding EIA code is added.

&lt;/center&gt;
For instance, an "NP0" capacitor with EIA code "C0G" will have 0 drift, with a tolerance of ±30&amp;nbsp;ppm/K, while an "N1500" with the code "P3K" will have −1500&amp;nbsp;ppm/K drift, with a maximum tolerance of ±250&amp;nbsp;ppm/°C. Note that the IEC and EIA capacitor codes are industry capacitor codes and not the same as military capacitor codes.

Class 1 capacitors include capacitors with different temperature coefficients α. Especially, NP0/CG/C0G capacitors with an α ±0•10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;/K and an α tolerance of 30&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] are technically of great interest. These capacitors have a capacitance variation dC/C of ±0.54% within the temperature range −55 to +125&amp;nbsp;°C. This enables accurate frequency response over a wide temperature range (in, for example, resonant circuits). The other materials with their special temperature behavior are used to compensate a counter temperature run of parallel connected components like coils in oscillator circuits. Class 1 capacitors exhibit very small tolerances of the rated capacitance.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Class 2 ceramic capacitors===
[[File:MLCC-Cap-Temp-Klasse-2-Kurven-engl.svg|thumb|right|Class 2 ceramic capacitors with their typical tolerances of the temperature dependent capacitance (colored areas)]]

Class 2 ceramic capacitors have a dielectric with a high permittivity and therefore a better volumetric efficiency than class 1 capacitors, but lower accuracy and stability. The ceramic dielectric is characterized by a nonlinear change of capacitance over the temperature range. The capacitance value also depends on the applied voltage. They are suitable for bypass, coupling and decoupling applications or for frequency discriminating circuits where low losses and high stability of capacitance are less important. They typically exhibit [[Ceramic capacitor#Microphony|microphony]].

Class 2 capacitors are made of [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] materials such as [[barium titanate]] ({{chem|Ba|Ti|O|3}}) and suitable additives such as [[aluminium silicate]], [[Talc|magnesium silicate]] and [[aluminium oxide]]. These ceramics have high to very high permittivity (200 to 14,000), which depends on the [[field strength]]. Hence the capacitance value of class 2 capacitors is nonlinear. It depends on temperature and voltage applied. Additionally class 2 capacitors age over time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002" /&gt;

However, the high permittivity supports high capacitance values in small devices. Class 2 capacitors are significantly smaller than class 1 devices at the equal rated capacitance and voltage. They are suitable for applications that require the capacitor to maintain only a minimum value of capacitance, for example, buffering and filtering in power supplies and coupling and decoupling of electric signals.

Class 2 capacitors are labeled according to the change in capacitance over the temperature range. The most widely used classification is based on the EIA RS-198 standard and uses a three-digit code. The first character is a letter that gives the low-end [[operating temperature]]. The second gives the high-end operating temperature, and the final character gives capacitance change over that temperature range:

&lt;/center&gt;
For instance, a Z5U capacitor will operate from +10&amp;nbsp;°C to +85&amp;nbsp;°C with a capacitance change of at most +22% to −56%. An X7R capacitor will operate from −55&amp;nbsp;°C to +125&amp;nbsp;°C with a capacitance change of at most ±15%.

Some commonly used class 2 ceramic capacitor materials are listed below:
* ''X8R'' (−55/+150, ΔC/C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ±15%),
* ''X7R'' (−55/+125&amp;nbsp;°C, ΔC/C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ±15%),
* ''X6R'' (−55/+105&amp;nbsp;°C, ΔC/C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ±15%),
* ''X5R'' (−55/+85&amp;nbsp;°C, ΔC/C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ±15%),
* ''X7S'' (−55/+125, ΔC/C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ±22%),
* ''Z5U'' (+10/+85&amp;nbsp;°C, ΔC/C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = +22/−56%),
* ''Y5V'' (−30/+85&amp;nbsp;°C, ΔC/C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = +22/−82%),

In most cases it is possible to translate the EIA code into the IEC/EN code. Slight translation errors occur, but normally are tolerable.
* '''X7R''' correlates with '''2X1'''
* '''Z5U''' correlates with '''2E6'''
* '''Y5V''' similar to '''2F4''', aberration: ΔC/C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = +30/−80% instead of +30/−82%
* '''X7S''' similar to '''2C1''', aberration: ΔC/C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ±20% instead of ±22%
* '''X8R''' no IEC/EN code available

Because class 2 ceramic capacitors have lower capacitance accuracy and stability, they require higher tolerance.

For '''military types''' the class 2 dielectrics specify temperature characteristic (TC) but not temperature-voltage characteristic (TVC).  Similar to X7R, military type BX cannot vary more than 15% over temperature, and in addition, must remain within +15%/-25 % at maximum rated voltage.  Type BR has a TVC limit of +15%/-40%.

===Class 3 ceramic capacitors===
Class 3 [[barrier layer]] or [[Semiconductor|semiconductive]] ceramic capacitors have very high permittivity, up to 50,000 and therefore a better volumetric efficiency than class 2 capacitors. However, these capacitors have worse electrical characteristics, including lower accuracy and stability. The dielectric is characterized by very high nonlinear change of capacitance over the temperature range. The capacitance value additionally depends on the voltage applied. As well, they have very high losses and age over time.

Barrier layer ceramic capacitors are made of doped ferroelectric materials such as [[barium titanate]] ({{chem|Ba|Ti|O|3}}). As this ceramic technology improved in the mid-1980s, barrier layer capacitors became available in values of up to 100&amp;nbsp;µF, and at that time it seemed that they could substitute for smaller [[electrolytic capacitor]]s.
[[File:Sperrschichtkondensator-WIKI-English.png|center|300px|Design and functional principle of a barrier layer capacitor]]
Because it is not possible to build multilayer capacitors with this material, only leaded single layer types are offered in the market.

{{As of|2013}} Barrier layer capacitors are considered obsolete, as modern class 2 multilayer ceramics can offer higher capacitances and better performance in a more compact package. As a consequence, these capacitors are no longer standardized by IEC.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Ceramic capacitors are composed of a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric or ferroelectric materials, appropriately mixed with other materials to achieve the desired characteristics. From these powder mixtures, the ceramic is [[sintering|sintered]] at high temperatures. The ceramic forms the dielectric and serves as a carrier for the metallic electrodes. The minimum thickness of the dielectric layer, which today (2013) for low voltage capacitors is in the size range of 0.5 [[micrometre|micrometers]]&lt;ref name=Murata /&gt; is limited downwards by the grain size of the ceramic powder. The thickness of the dielectric for capacitors with higher voltages is determined by the [[dielectric strength]] of the desired capacitor.

The electrodes of the capacitor are deposited on the ceramic layer by metallization. For MLCCs alternating metallized ceramic layers are stacked one above the other. The outstanding metallization of the electrodes at both sides of the body are connected with the contacting terminal. A lacquer or ceramic coating protects the capacitor against moisture and other ambient influences.

Ceramic capacitors come in various shapes and styles. Some of the most common are:
* Multilayer ceramic chip capacitor (MLCC), rectangular block, for [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounting]]
* Ceramic disc capacitor, single layer disc, resin coated, with [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] leads
* [[Feedthrough]] ceramic capacitor, used for bypass purposes in high-frequency circuits. Tube shape, inner metallization contacted with a lead, outer metallization for [[solder]]ing
* Ceramic power capacitors, larger ceramic bodies in different shapes for high voltage applications

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
An MLCC consists of a number of individual capacitors stacked together in parallel and contacted via the terminal surfaces. The starting material for all MLCC chips is a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric or ferroelectric raw materials, modified by accurately determined additives.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kahn, [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/mlcmat.pdf MULTILAYER CERAMIC CAPACITORS–MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURE, TECHNICAL INFORMATION, AVX Corporation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725105222/http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/mlcmat.pdf |date=July 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These powdered materials are mixed homogeneously. The composition of the mixture and the size of the powder particles, as small as 10&amp;nbsp;nm, reflect the manufacturer's expertise.

A thin ceramic foil is cast from a suspension of the powder with a suitable binder. This foil is rolled up for transport. Unrolled again, it is cut into equal-sized sheets, which are screen printed with a metal paste. These sheets become the electrodes. In an automated process, these sheets are stacked in the required number of layers and solidified by pressure. Besides the relative permittivity, the size and number of layers determines the later capacitance value. The electrodes are stacked in an alternating arrangement slightly offset from the adjoining layers so that they each can later be connected on the offset side, one left, one right. The layered stack is pressed and then cut into individual components. High mechanical precision is required, for example, to produce a 500 or more layer stack of size "0201" (0.5&amp;nbsp;mm × 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm).

After cutting, the binder is burnt out of the stack. This is followed by sintering at temperatures between 1,200 and 1,450&amp;nbsp;°C producing the final, mainly crystalline, structure. This burning process creates the desired dielectric properties. Burning is followed by cleaning and then metallization of both end surfaces. Through the metallization, the ends and the inner electrodes are connected in parallel and the capacitor gets its terminals. Finally a 100% measuring of the electrical values will be done and the taping for automated processing in a manufacturing device are performed.

====Miniaturizing====
The capacitance formula (''C'')  of a MLCC capacitor is based on the formula for a plate capacitor enhanced with the number of layers:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C=\varepsilon \cdot { {n \cdot A} \over {d} }&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
where ''ε'' stands for dielectric [[permittivity]];  ''A'' for electrode surface area; n for the number of layers; and ''d'' for the distance between the electrodes.
[[File:MLCC-development-1995-2005.png|right|300px|Miniaturizing of MLCC chip capacitors during 1995 to 2005]]
A thinner dielectric or a larger electrode area each increase the [[Electrical capacitance|capacitance value]], as will a dielectric material of higher permittivity.

With the progressive miniaturization of [[Digital data|digital]] electronics in recent decades, the components on the periphery of the integrated logic circuits have been scaled down as well. Shrinking an MLCC involves reducing the dielectric thickness and increasing the number of layers. Both options require huge efforts and are connected with a lot of expertise.

In 1995 the minimum thickness of the dielectric was 4&amp;nbsp;µm. By 2005 some manufacturers produced MLCC chips with layer thicknesses of 1&amp;nbsp;µm. {{As of|2010}}, the minimum thickness is about 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The field strength in the dielectric increased to 35&amp;nbsp;V/µm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passivecomponentmagazine.com/intel-voices-concerns-over-quality-of-high-capacitance-ceramic-chip-capacitors/ Intel Voices Concerns Over Quality of High Capacitance Ceramic Chip Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

The size reduction of these capacitors is achieved reducing powder grain size, the assumption to make the ceramic layers thinner. In addition, the manufacturing process became more precisely controlled, so that more and more layers can be stacked.

Between 1995 and 2005, the capacitance of a Y5V MLCC capacitor of size 1206 was increased from 4.7&amp;nbsp;μF to 100&amp;nbsp;μF.&lt;ref&gt;Shoji Tsubota:''[http://www.murata.com/articles/ta0573.pdf High-Capacitance Capacitors by Murata Make Smaller Power Supplies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105054033/http://www.murata.com/articles/ta0573.pdf |date=November 5, 2012 }}.'' AEI December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, (2013) a lot of producers can deliver class 2 MLCC capacitors with a capacitance value of 100 μF in the chip-size 0805.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuden.co.jp/ap/news/release/pdf_124.pdf Taiyo Yuden Introduces World’s First 100&amp;nbsp;μF EIA 0805 Size Multilayer Ceramic Capacitor ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====MLCC case sizes====
MLCCs don’t have leads, and as a result they are usually smaller than their counterparts with leads. They don’t require through-hole access in a PCB to mount and are designed to be handled by machines rather than by humans. As a result, surface-mount components like MLCCs are typically cheaper.

MLCCs are manufactured in standardized shapes and sizes for comparable handling. Because the early standardization was dominated by American EIA standards the dimensions of the MLCC chips were standardized by EIA in units of inches. A rectangular chip with the dimensions of 0.06 inch length and 0.03 inch width is coded as "0603". This code is international and in common use. [[JEDEC]] (IEC/EN), devised a second, metric code. The EIA code and the metric equivalent of the common sizes of multilayer ceramic chip capacitors, and the dimensions in mm are shown in the following table. Missing from the table is the measure of the height "H". This is generally not listed, because the height of MLCC chips depends on the number of layers and thus on the capacitance. Normally, however, the height H does not exceed the width W.

====NME and BME metallization====

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

A particular problem in the production of multilayer ceramic chip capacitors at the end of the 1990s was a strong price increase of the metals used for the electrodes and terminals. The original choices were the non-oxidizable [[noble metal]]s [[silver]] and [[palladium]] which can withstand high sintering temperatures of 1200 to 1400&amp;nbsp;°C. They were called "NME" (Noble Metal Electrode) and offered very good electrical properties to class 2 capacitors. The price increase of these metals greatly increased capacitor prices.

Cost pressures led to the development of BME (Base Metal Electrodes) using the much cheaper materials [[nickel]] and [[copper]].&lt;ref&gt;Yuki Nagoshi, AEI November 2009, [http://www.catagle.com/15-1/ta0982.htm Wielding Base Metal Yields Cheaper, Stable Class X2 Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

But BME metallization produced different electrical properties; for example, the voltage dependence of X7R capacitors increased significantly (see picture). Even the loss factor and the impedance behavior of class 2 ceramic capacitors were lessened by BME metallization.

For class 2 ceramic capacitors, because of their use in applications where it is usually not very important for the stability of the electrical properties, these negative changes, for cost reasons, were finally accepted by the market, while the NME metallization was maintained in the class 1 ceramic capacitors.

====MLCC capacitance ranges====
[[File:MLCC-Max-Kap-Kurven-Eng-1210-2017.png|thumb|Maximal available capacitance values of MLCC Chips in case size 2012. (Status April 2017)]]

Capacitance of MLCC chips depends on the dielectric, the size and the required voltage (rated voltage). Capacitance values start at about 1pF. The maximum capacitance value is determined by the production technique. For X7R that is 47&amp;nbsp;µF, for Y5V: 100&amp;nbsp;µF.

The picture right shows the maximum capacitance for class 1 and class 2 multilayer ceramic chip capacitors. The following two tables, for ceramics NP0/C0G and X7R each, list for each common case size the maximum available capacitance value and rated voltage of the leading manufacturers Murata, TDK, KEMET, AVX.

&lt;/center&gt;
In the region of its [[resonance frequency]], a capacitor has the best decoupling properties for noise or [[electromagnetic interference]]. The resonance frequency of a capacitor is determined by the [[inductance]] of the component. The inductive parts of a capacitor are summarized in the equivalent series inductance, or ESL. (Note that L is the electrical symbol for inductance.) The smaller the inductance, the higher the resonance frequency.

Because, especially in digital signal processing, switching frequencies have continued to rise, the demand for high frequency decoupling or filter capacitors increases. With a simple design change the ESL of a MLCC chip can be reduced. Therefore, the stacked electrodes are connected on the longitudinal side with the connecting terminations. This reduces the distance that the charge carriers flow over the electrodes, which reduces inductance of the component.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avx.com/docs/catalogs/lga2t.pdf AVX, Low Inductance Capacitors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516004438/http://www.avx.com/docs/catalogs/lga2t.pdf |date=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the result for X7R with 0.1&amp;nbsp;µF in the size of 0805, with a resonance frequency of about 16&amp;nbsp;MHz increases to about 22&amp;nbsp;MHz if the chip has a 0508-size with terminations at the longitudinal side.

Another possibility is to form the device as an array of capacitors. Here, several individual capacitors are built in a common housing. Connecting them in parallel, the resulting ESL as well as ESR values of the components are reduced.

====X2Y decoupling capacitor====
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

A standard multi-layer ceramic capacitor has many opposing electrode layers stacked inside connected with two outer terminations. The X2Y ceramic chip capacitor however is a 4 terminal chip device. It is constructed like a standard two-terminal MLCC out of the stacked ceramic layers with an additional third set of shield electrodes incorporated in the chip. These shield electrodes surround each existing electrode within the stack of the capacitor plates and are low ohmic contacted with two additional side terminations across to the capacitor terminations. The X2Y construction results in a three-node capacitive circuit that provides simultaneous line-to-line and line-to-ground filtering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.x2y.com/ X2Y Attenuators LLC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.x2y.com/techsummary.htm X2Y Technology Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syfer.com/Capacitors_1.aspx?id=1:27343&amp;id2=1:28844&amp;id2=1:27300 Syfer, X2Y Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Capable of replacing 2 or more conventional devices, the X2Y ceramic capacitors are ideal for high frequency filtering or noise suppression of supply voltages in digital circuits, and can prove invaluable in meeting stringent [[Electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] demands in dc motors, in automotive, audio, sensor and other applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syfer.com/doc_docs/sm_filter_article.pdf Multilayer Ceramic EMI-Filter, Syfer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johansondielectrics.com/x2y-products/x2y-technology-overview.html X2Y Technology overview Johanson]&lt;/ref&gt;

The X2Y footprint results in lower mounted inductance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.x2y.com/publications/decoupling/jun21-06.pdf Decoupling Capacitors, A Designer’s Roadmap to Optimal Decoupling Networks for Integrated Circuits]&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly of interest for use in high-speed digital circuits with clock rates of several 100&amp;nbsp;MHz and upwards. There the decoupling of the individual supply voltages on the circuit board is difficult to realize due to parasitic inductances of the supply lines. A standard solution with conventional ceramic capacitors requires the parallel use of many conventional MLCC chips with different capacitance values. Here X2Y capacitors are able to replace up to five equal-sized ceramic capacitors on the PCB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.x2y.com/techlib.htm X2Y Capacitor Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this particular type of ceramic capacitor is patented, so these components are still comparatively expensive.

An alternative to X2Y capacitors may be a three-terminal capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murata.com/~/media/webrenewal/products/emc/emifil/knowhow/20to22.ashx Three-terminal Capacitor Structure, Murata]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mechanical susceptibility====

Ceramic is on the one hand a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at relatively low mechanical stress&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/resources/avoiding-capacitor-cracking-webinar-lp | title=Avoiding Pad Cratering and Capacitor Cracking webinar &amp;#124; DFR Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;. MLCC chips as [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mounted]] [[Electronic component|components]] are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the [[printed circuit board]] (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one.&lt;ref&gt;P. O’Malley, D. Wang, H. Duong, Anh Lai, Z. Zelle, May 25, 2011 [http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2011fuze/SessionIIIAOMalley.pdf Ceramic Capacitor Failures and Lessons Learned, Presented to the 55th Annual NDIA Fuze Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113034107/http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2011fuze/SessionIIIAOMalley.pdf |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery caption="MLCC chips – correct mounted – cracked chip – substrate bending test" class="float-right" style="margin:1em"&gt;
File:SMD-chip-soldering.svg|Correct mounted and soldered MLCC chip on a PCB

File:MLCC-Flexure-Test engl.svg|Simplified figure of a bending test for soldered MLCC
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
The capability of MLCC chips to withstand mechanical stress is tested by a so-called substrate bending test. Here, a test PCB with a soldered MLCC chip between two support points is bent by a punch at a path length of 1 to 3mm. The path length depends on the requirements that come out from the application. If no crack appears, the capacitors are able to withstand the wanted requirements. Cracks are usually detected by a short circuit or a change of the capacitance value in the deflected state.

The bending strength of the MLCC chip differs by the property of the ceramic, the size of the chip and the design of the capacitors. Without any special design features, NP0/C0G class 1 ceramic MLCC chips reach a typical bending strength of 2mm while larger types of X7R, Y5V class 2 ceramic chips achieved only a bending strength of approximately 1mm. Smaller chips, such as the size of 0402, reached in all types of ceramics larger bending strength values.

With special design features, particularly by special design of the electrodes and the terminations, the bending strength can be improved. For example, an internal short circuit arises by the contact of two electrodes with opposite polarity, which will be produced at the break of the ceramic in the region of the terminations. This can be prevented when the overlap surfaces of the electrodes are reduced. This is achieved e.g. by an "Open Mode Design" (OMD). Here a break in the region of the terminations only reduce the capacitance value a little bit (AVX, KEMET).

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

With a similar construction called "Floating Electrode Design" (FED) or "Multi-layer Serial Capacitors" (MLSC), also, only capacitance reduction results if parts of the capacitor body break. This construction works with floating electrodes without any conductive connection to the termination. A break doesn’t lead to a short, only to capacitance reduction.
However, both structures lead to larger designs with respect to a standard MLCC version with the same capacitance value.

The same volume with respect to standard MLCCs is achieved by the introduction of a flexible intermediate layer of a conductive polymer between the electrodes and the termination called "Flexible Terminations" (FT-Cap) or "Soft Terminations".  In this construction, the rigid metallic soldering connection can move against the flexible polymer layer, and thus can absorb the bending forces, without resulting in a break in the ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Sloka, Dan Skamser, Reggie Phillips, Allen Hill, Mark Laps, Roy Grace, John Prymak, Michael Randall, Aziz Tajuddin: ''[http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/B6F1676B145ECA92852572BC0064B814/$file/2007%20CARTS%20-%20Flexure%20Robust%20Capacitors.pdf Flexure Robust Capacitors].'' CARTS, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== RFI/EMI suppression with X- and Y capacitors ====
Suppression capacitors are effective interference reduction components because their electrical [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] decreases with increasing frequency, so that at higher frequencies they short circuit electrical noise and transients between the lines, or to ground. They therefore prevent equipment and machinery (including motors, inverters, and electronic ballasts, as well as solid-state relay snubbers and spark quenchers) from sending and receiving electromagnetic and radio frequency interference as well as transients in across-the-line (X capacitors) and line-to-ground (Y capacitors) connections. X capacitors effectively absorb symmetrical, balanced, or differential interference. Y capacitors are connected in a line bypass between a line phase and a point of zero potential, to absorb asymmetrical, unbalanced, or common-mode interference.&lt;ref&gt;Vishay, [http://www.vishay.com/docs/26529/gentecin.pdf General Technical Information, Radio Interference Suppression Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Illinois capacitor inc.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

EMI/RFI suppression capacitors are designed so that any remaining interference or electrical noise does not exceed the limits of EMC directive EN 50081.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/electrical/documents/emc/legislation/ |title=Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Legislation: Directive 89/336/EC |work=ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2012-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705044039/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/electrical/documents/emc/legislation/ |archivedate=2012-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppression components are connected directly to mains voltage for 10 to 20 years or more and are therefore exposed to potentially damaging overvoltages and transients. For this reason, suppression capacitors must comply with the safety and non-flammability requirements of international safety standards such as
* Europe: EN 60384-14,
* USA: UL 1414, UL 1283
* Canada: CSA C22.2, No.1, CSA C22.2, No.8
* China: CQC (GB/T 14472-1998)
RFI capacitors that fulfill all specified requirements are imprinted with the [[certification mark]] of various national safety standards agencies. For power line applications, special requirements are placed on the non-flammability of the coating and the epoxy resin impregnating or coating the capacitor body.  To receive safety approvals, X and Y powerline-rated capacitors are [[destructive testing|destructively tested]] to the point of failure. Even when exposed to large overvoltage surges, these safety-rated capacitors must fail in a [[fail-safe]] manner that does not endanger personnel or property.

{{As of|2012}} most ceramic capacitors used for EMI/RFI suppression were leaded ones for through-hole mounting on a PCB,&lt;ref name= MurataXY&gt;Murata, Ceramic Capacitors Certified by safety standard/Compliant with EA&amp;MS Act [http://www.murata.com/products/capacitor/design/certification/safety.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vishay, Capacitors - Ceramic - RFI Class X/Y [http://www.vishay.com/capacitors/ceramic/rfi-class-xy/ Vishay, Capacitors - Ceramic - RFI Class X/Y] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815010758/http://www.vishay.com/capacitors/ceramic/rfi-class-xy/ |date=August 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the surface-mount technique is becoming more and more important.

===Ceramic power capacitors===
&lt;gallery caption="Different styles of ceramic capacitors for power electronic" style="margin:auto; text-align:center" align="center"&gt;
File:Kerko-HV-Scheibenkondensator.png|Doorknob style high voltage ceramic capacitor

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Although the materials used for large power ceramic capacitors mostly are very similar to those used for smaller ones, ceramic capacitors with high to very high power or voltage ratings for applications in power systems, transmitters and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. The standardization of ceramic capacitors for lower power is oriented toward electrical and mechanical parameters as components for use in electronic equipment. The standardization of power capacitors, contrary to that, is strongly focused on protecting personnel and equipment, given by the local regulating authority.
[[File:Kondensatoren in dobl.jpg|thumb|200px|Power ceramic capacitors in a radio-frequency transmitter station]]
As modern electronic equipment gained the ability to handle power levels that were previously the exclusive domain of "electrical power" components, the distinction between the "electronic" and "electrical" power ratings has become less distinct. In the past, the boundary between these two families was approximately at a reactive power of 200 volt-amps, but modern power electronics can handle increasing amounts of power.

Power ceramic capacitors are mostly specified for much higher than 200 volt-amps. The great plasticity of ceramic raw material and the high dielectric strength of ceramics deliver solutions for many applications and are the reasons for the enormous diversity of styles within the family of power ceramic capacitors. These power capacitors have been on the market for decades. They are produced according to the requirements as class 1 power ceramic capacitors with high stability and low losses or class 2 power ceramic capacitors with high volumetric efficiency.

Class 1 power ceramic capacitors are used for [[LC circuit|resonant circuit]] application in [[transmitter station]]s. Class 2 power ceramic capacitors are used for [[circuit breaker]]s, for [[Electric power distribution|power distribution lines]], for high voltage [[power supply|power supplies]] in laser-applications, for [[induction furnace]]s and in [[Voltage doubler|voltage-doubling circuits]].  Power ceramic capacitors can be supplied with high rated voltages in the range of 2&amp;nbsp;kV up to 100&amp;nbsp;kV.&lt;ref&gt;AVX, [http://www.avx.com/docs/catalogs/hp-hw-hk.pdf High Voltage Ceramic Capacitors 15 to 100 kV, Strontium based dielectric, series HP/HW/HK] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725043109/http://www.avx.com/docs/catalogs/hp-hw-hk.pdf |date=July 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimensions of these power ceramic capacitors can be very large. At high power applications the losses of these capacitors can generate a lot of heat. For this reason some special styles of power ceramic capacitors have pipes for water-cooling.

==Electrical characteristics==

===Series-equivalent circuit===
[[File:Film capacitor Ersatzschaltbild.svg|thumb|right|Series-equivalent circuit model of a ceramic capacitor]]
All electrical characteristics of ceramic capacitors can be defined and specified by a series equivalent circuit composed out of an idealized capacitance and additional electrical components, which model all losses and inductive parameters of a capacitor. In this series-equivalent circuit the electrical characteristics of a capacitors is defined by

* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor,
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;insul&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation resistance]] of the dielectric, not to be confused with the insulation of the housing
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;ESR&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series resistance]], which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESR".
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series inductance]], which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESL".

The use of a series equivalent circuit instead of a parallel equivalent circuit is defined in IEC/EN 60384-1.

===Capacitance standard values and tolerances===
The "rated capacitance" C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or "nominal capacitance" C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. The actual capacitance depends on the measuring frequency and the ambient temperature. Standardized conditions for capacitors are a low-voltage AC measuring method at a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C with frequencies of

* Class 1 ceramic capacitors
** C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; 100&amp;nbsp;pF at 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, measuring voltage 5&amp;nbsp;V
** C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 100&amp;nbsp;pF at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, measuring voltage 5&amp;nbsp;V
* Class 2 ceramic capacitors
** C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; 100&amp;nbsp;pF at 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, measuring voltage 1&amp;nbsp;V
** 100 pF &amp;lt; C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; 10&amp;nbsp;µF at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, measuring voltage 1&amp;nbsp;V
** C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 10&amp;nbsp;µF at 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz, measuring voltage 0.5&amp;nbsp;V

Capacitors are available in different, geometrically increasing [[Preferred number|preferred values]] as specified in the [[E-series of preferred numbers|E series]] standards specified in [[IEC/EN 60063]]. According to the number of values per decade, these were called the E3, E6, E12, [[E24 series|E24]], etc. series. The units used to specify capacitor values includes everything from picofarad (pF), nanofarad (nF), microfarad (µF) and farad (F).

The percentage of allowed deviation of the capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]. The actual capacitance value must be within the tolerance limits, or the capacitor is out of specification. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in [[IEC/EN 60062]].

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

The required capacitance tolerance is determined by the particular application. The narrow tolerances of E24 to E96 will be used for high-quality class 1 capacitors in circuits such as precision oscillators and timers. On the other hand, for general applications such as non-critical filtering or coupling circuits, for class 2 capacitors the tolerance series E12 down to E3 are sufficient.

===Temperature dependence of capacitance===
Capacitance of ceramic capacitors varies with temperature. The different dielectrics of the many capacitor types show great differences in temperature dependence. The temperature coefficient is expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm) per degree Celsius for class 1 ceramic capacitors or in percent (%) over the total temperature range for class 2 capacitors.

&lt;/center&gt;

===Frequency dependence of capacitance===
[[File:MLCC-Kap-versus-Frequenz-engl.svg|thumb|right|200px| Frequency dependence of capacitance for ceramic X7R and Y5V class 2 capacitors (curve of NP0 class 1 for comparisation)]]

Most discrete capacitor types have greater or smaller capacitance changes with increasing frequencies. The dielectric strength of class 2 ceramic and plastic film diminishes with rising frequency. Therefore, their capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency. This phenomenon is related to the [[dielectric relaxation]] in which the time constant of the electrical dipoles is the reason for the frequency dependence of [[permittivity]]. The graph on the right hand side shows typical frequency behavior for class 2 vs class 1 capacitors.

===Voltage dependence of capacitance===
[[File:DC Bias characteristic of ferroelectrics.PNG|thumb|right| DC Bias characteristic of ferroelectrics ceramic materials]]
Capacitance of ceramic capacitors may also change with applied voltage. This effect is more prevalent in class 2 ceramic capacitors.  The ferroelectric material depends on the applied voltage.&lt;ref&gt;A. Skelly, M. D. Waugh, Understanding DC Bias Characteristics in High-Capacitance MLCCs [http://www.ceramicindustry.com/articles/90304-understanding-dc-bias-characteristics-in-high-capacitance-mlccs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Istvan Novak, Oracle-America Inc., DesignCon 2011, DC and AC Bias Dependence of Capacitors, [http://www.electrical-integrity.com/Paper_download_files/DC11_13-TH2Paper_Novak.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the applied voltage, the lower the permittivity. Capacitance measured or applied with higher voltage can drop to values of -80% of the value measured with the standardized measuring voltage of 0.5 or 1.0&amp;nbsp;V. This behavior is a small source of nonlinearity in low-distortion filters and other analog applications. In audio applications this can be the reason for [[Total harmonic distortion|harmonic distortions]].

===Voltage proof===
For most capacitors, a physically conditioned dielectric strength or a breakdown voltage usually could be specified for each dielectric material and thickness. This is not possible with ceramic capacitors. The breakdown voltage of a ceramic dielectric layer may vary depending on the electrode material and the sintering conditions of the ceramic up to a factor of 10. A high degree of precision and control of process parameters is necessary to keep the scattering of electrical properties for today's very thin ceramic layers within specified limits.

The voltage proof of ceramic capacitors is specified as rated voltage (UR). This is the maximum DC voltage that may be continuously applied to the capacitor up to the upper temperature limit. This guaranteed voltage proof is tested according to the voltages shown in the adjacent table.

Furthermore, in periodic life time tests (endurance tests) the voltage proof of ceramic capacitors is tested with increased test voltage (120 to 150% of U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) to ensure safe construction.

===Impedance===
[[File:Kondensator Zeigerdiagramm-1-.svg|thumb|right|150px|Simplified series-equivalent circuit of a capacitor for higher frequencies (above); vector diagram with electrical reactances X_ESL and X_C and resistance ESR and for illustration the impedance Z and dissipation factor tan δ]]

The frequency dependent [[AC power|AC]] resistance of a capacitor is called [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and is a complex ratio of voltage to current in an AC circuit. Impedance extends the concept of [[Ohm's law]] to AC circuits, and possesses both magnitude and phase at a particular frequency, unlike resistance, which has only magnitude.

Impedance is a measure of the ability of the capacitor to pass alternating currents. In this sense impedance can be used like Ohms law

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\hat u}{\hat \imath} = \frac{U_\mathrm{AC}}{I_\mathrm{AC}}.&lt;/math&gt;

to calculate either the peak or the effective value of the current or the voltage.

As shown in the series-equivalent circuit of a capacitor, the real-world component includes an ideal capacitor &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, an inductance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and a resistor &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

To calculate the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; the resistance and the both reactances have to be added geometrically
:&lt;math&gt;Z=\sqrt{{ESR}^2 + (X_\mathrm{C} + (-X_\mathrm{L}))^2}&lt;/math&gt;

wherein the capacitive reactance ([[Capacitance]]) is
:&lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

and an inductive reactance ([[Inductance]]) is
:&lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;.
In the special case of [[resonance]], in which both reactive resistances have the same value (&lt;math&gt;X_C = X_L&lt;/math&gt;), then the impedance will only be determined by &lt;math&gt;{ESR}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:MLCC-Imp-versus-Freqenz.engl.png|thumb|center|200px|Typical curves of the impedance of X7R and NP0-MLCC-Chips]]
Data sheets of ceramic capacitors only specify the impedance magnitude &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. The typical impedance curve shows that with increasing frequency, impedance decreases, down to a minimum. The lower the impedance, the more easily alternating currents can pass through the capacitor. At the minimum point of the curve, the point of resonance, where X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; has the same value as X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, the capacitor exhibits its lowest impedance value. Here only the ohmic ESR determines the impedance. With frequencies above the resonance, impedance increases again due to the ESL.

===ESR, dissipation factor, and quality factor===
The summarized losses in ceramic capacitors are ohmic [[Alternating current|AC]] losses. [[Direct current|DC]] losses are specified as "[[leakage current]]" or "insulating resistance" and are negligible for an AC specification. These AC losses are nonlinear and may depend on frequency, temperature, age, and for some special types, on humidity. The losses result from two physical conditions,
* line losses with internal supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes
* the [[Loss tangent|dielectric losses]] out of the [[Dipolar polarization|dielectric polarization]]

The largest share of these losses in larger capacitors is usually the frequency dependent ohmic dielectric losses. Regarding the IEC 60384-1 standard, the ohmic losses of capacitors are measured at the same frequency used to measure capacitance. These are:

* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1&amp;nbsp;MHz (preferred) or 10&amp;nbsp;MHz for ceramic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 nF:
* 1&amp;nbsp;kHz or 10&amp;nbsp;kHz for ceramic capacitors with 1 nF &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 10 μF
* 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz or 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz for ceramic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 10 μF

Results of the summarized resistive losses of a capacitor may be specified either as [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR), as [[dissipation factor]] (DF, tan δ), or as [[quality factor]] (Q), depending on the application requirements.

Class 2 capacitors are mostly specified with the dissipation factor, tan δ. The dissipation factor is determined as the tangent of the reactance &lt;math&gt;X_C&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;X_L&lt;/math&gt; and the ESR, and can be shown as the angle δ between the imaginary and impedance axes in the above vector diagram, see paragraph "Impedance".

If the inductance &lt;math&gt; ESL &lt;/math&gt; is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:
: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta = ESR \cdot \omega C&lt;/math&gt;

Class 1 capacitors with very low losses are specified with a dissipation factor and often with a [[Q factor#Electrical systems|quality factor]] (Q). The quality factor is defined as the reciprocal of the dissipation factor.

:&lt;math&gt; Q = \frac{1}{tan \delta} = \frac{f_0}{B} \ &lt;/math&gt;

The Q factor represents the effect of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]], and characterizes a resonator's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; relative to its center or resonant frequency &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt;.  A high Q value is a mark of the quality of the resonance for resonant circuits.

In accordance with IEC 60384-8/-21/-9/-22 ceramic capacitors may not exceed the following dissipation factors:

The ohmic losses of ceramic capacitors are frequency, temperature and voltage dependent. Additionally, class 2 capacitor measurements change because of aging. Different ceramic materials have differing losses over the temperature range and the operating frequency. The changes in class 1 capacitors are in the single-digit range while class 2 capacitors have much higher changes.

===HF use, inductance (ESL) and self-resonant frequency===
[[Electrical resonance]] occurs in an ceramic capacitor at a particular [[Resonance|resonance frequency]]  where the imaginary parts of the capacitor [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and [[admittance]]s cancel each other.
This frequency where X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is as high as X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is called the self-resonant frequency and can be calculated with:

&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ω = 2π''f'', in which ''f'' is the resonance frequency in [[Hertz]], ''L'' is the inductance in [[Henry (unit)|henries]], and ''C'' is the capacitance in [[farad]]s.

The smaller the capacitance C and the inductance L the higher is the resonance frequency.
The self-resonant frequency is the lowest frequency at which impedance passes through a minimum. For any AC application the self-resonant frequency is the highest frequency at which a capacitor can be used as a capacitive component. At frequencies above the resonance, the impedance increases again due to ESL: the capacitor becomes an inductor with inductance equal to capacitor's ESL, and resistance equal to ESR at the given frequency.

ESL in industrial capacitors is mainly caused by the leads and internal connections used to connect the plates to the outside world. Larger capacitors tend to higher ESL than small ones, because the distances to the plate are longer and every millimeter increases inductance.

Ceramic capacitors, which are available in the range of very small capacitance values (pF and higher) are already out of their smaller capacitance values suitable for higher frequencies up to several 100&amp;nbsp;MHz (see formula above).
Due to the absence of leads and proximity to the electrodes, MLCC chips have significantly lower parasitic inductance than f. e. leaded types, which makes them suitable for higher frequency applications. A further reduction of parasitic inductance is achieved by contacting the electrodes on the longitudinal side of the chip instead of the lateral side.

Sample self-resonant frequencies for one set of NP0/C0G and one set of X7R ceramic capacitors are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiant.su/files/images/Syfer/mlc_capacitor_catalogue.pdf Syfer Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that X7Rs have better frequency response than C0Gs. It makes sense, however, since class 2 capacitors are much smaller than class 1, so they ought to have lower parasitic inductance.

===Aging===
[[File:Delta-Cap-versus-Zeit-engl.png|thumb|right|Aging of different Class 2 ceramic capacitors compared with NP0-Class 1 ceramic capacitor]]
In [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] class 2 ceramic capacitors capacitance decreases over time. This behavior is called "aging". Aging occurs in ferroelectric dielectrics, where domains of polarization in the dielectric contribute to total polarization. Degradation of the polarized domains in the dielectric decreases permittivity over time so that the capacitance of class 2 ceramic capacitors decreases as the component ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=K. W. Plessner|Periodical=Proceedings of the Physical Society. Section B|Title=Ageing of the Dielectric Properties of Barium Titanate Ceramics |Volume=69|Year=1956|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;1261–1268|Date=  1956|language=German|DOI=10.1088/0370-1301/69/12/309}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Takaaki Tsurumi &amp; Motohiro Shono &amp; Hirofumi Kakemoto &amp; Satoshi Wada &amp; Kenji Saito &amp; Hirokazu Chazono, Mechanism of capacitance aging under DC-bias field in X7R-MLCCs
Published online: 23 March 2007, # Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2007
[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10832-007-9071-0?LI=true#page-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The aging follows a logarithmic law. This law defines the decrease of capacitance as a percentage for a time decade after the soldering recovery time at a defined temperature, for example, in the period from 1 to 10 hours at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. As the law is logarithmic, the percentage loss of capacitance will twice between 1&amp;nbsp;h and 100&amp;nbsp;h and 3 times between 1&amp;nbsp;h and 1000&amp;nbsp;h and so on. So aging is fastest near the beginning, and the capacitance value effectively stabilizes over time.

The rate of aging of class 2 capacitors mainly depends on the materials used. A rule of thumb is, the higher the temperature dependence of the ceramic, the higher the aging percentage. The typical aging of X7R ceramic capacitors is about 2.5% per decade&lt;ref&gt;Christopher England , Johanson dielectrics, [http://www.johansondielectrics.com/technical-notes/general/ceramic-capacitor-aging-made-simple.html Ceramic Capacitor Aging Made Simple]&lt;/ref&gt; The aging rate of Z5U ceramic capacitors is significantly higher and can be up to 7% per decade.

The aging process of class 2 capacitors may be reversed by heating the component above the [[Curie point]].&lt;ref name=Waugh /&gt;

Class 1 capacitors do not experience ferroelectric aging like Class 2's. But environmental influences such as higher temperature, high humidity and mechanical stress can, over a longer period of time, lead to a small irreversible decline in capacitance, sometimes also called aging. The change of capacitance for P&amp;nbsp;100 and N&amp;nbsp;470 Class 1's is lower than 1%, for capacitors with N&amp;nbsp;750 to N&amp;nbsp;1500 ceramics it is ≤ 2%.

===Insulation resistance and self-discharge constant===
The resistance of the dielectric is never infinite, leading to some level of [[Direct current|DC "leakage current"]], which contributes to self-discharge. For ceramic capacitors this resistance, placed in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of capacitors, is called "insulation resistance R&lt;sub&gt;ins&lt;/sub&gt;". The insulation resistance must not be confused with the outer isolation with respect to the environment.

The rate of self-discharge with decreasing capacitor voltage follows the formula
: &lt;math&gt;u(t) = U_0 \cdot \mathrm{e}^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{s}},&lt;/math&gt;
With the stored DC voltage &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; and the self-discharge constant
: &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{s} = R_\mathrm{ins} \cdot C&lt;/math&gt;
That means, after &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt; capacitor voltage &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; dropped to 37% of the initial value.

The insulation resistance given in the unit MΩ (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Ohm) as well as the self-discharge constant in seconds is an important parameter for the quality of the dielectric insulation. These time values are important, for example, when a capacitor is used as timing component for relays or for storing a voltage value as in a [[sample and hold]] circuits or [[operational amplifier]]s.

In accordance with the applicable standards, Class 1 ceramic capacitors have an R&lt;sub&gt;ins&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 10,000&amp;nbsp;MΩ for capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; 10&amp;nbsp;nF or &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 100&amp;nbsp;s for capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 10&amp;nbsp;nF.  Class 2 ceramic capacitors have an R&lt;sub&gt;ins&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 4,000&amp;nbsp;MΩ for capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; 25&amp;nbsp;nF or &amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 100&amp;nbsp;s for capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 25&amp;nbsp;nF.

Insulation resistance and thus the self-discharge time rate are temperature dependent and decrease with increasing temperature at about 1&amp;nbsp;MΩ per 60&amp;nbsp;°C.

===Dielectric absorption (soakage)===
{{main|Dielectric absorption}}
Dielectric absorption is the name given to the effect by which a capacitor, which has been charged for a long time, discharges only incompletely. Although an ideal capacitor remains at zero volts after discharge, real capacitors will develop a small voltage coming from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], "soakage" or "battery action".

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable centered"
|+ Values of dielectric absorption for some often used capacitors
|- style="background:#abcdef;"
! Type of capacitor
! Dielectric Absorption
|-
| Class-1 ceramic capacitors, NP0 || 0.3 to 0.6%
|-
| Class-2 ceramic capacitors, X7R || 2.0 to 2.5%
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

In many applications of capacitors dielectric absorption is not a problem but in some applications, such as long-[[time constant|time-constant]] [[integrator]]s, [[sample-and-hold]] circuits, switched-capacitor [[analog-to-digital converter]]s and very low-distortion [[Electronic filter|filter]]s, it is important that the capacitor does not recover a residual charge after full discharge, and capacitors with low absorption are specified. The voltage at the terminals generated by dielectric absorption may in some cases possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit or can be a safety risk to personnel. In order to prevent shocks, most very large capacitors like power capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that are removed before use.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Kundert [http://www.designers-guide.org/Modeling/da.pdf Modeling Dielectric Absorption in Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microphony===
All class 2 ceramic capacitors using ferroelectric ceramics exhibit [[piezoelectricity]], and have a piezoelectric effect called [[microphonics]], microphony or in audio applications squealing.&lt;ref&gt;Satoshi Ishitobi, Murata, Murata Addresses Squealing in Mobile, A/V Devices {{cite web|url=http://www.murata.com/products/article/pdf/ta1282.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627041500/http://www.murata.com/products/article/pdf/ta1282.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microphony describes the phenomenon wherein [[Electronics|electronic]] components transform mechanical [[vibration]]s into an electrical signal which in many cases is undesired [[Noise (electronics)|noise]].&lt;ref&gt;Kemet, Capacitors for Reduced Microphonics and Sound Emissions, [http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/118EBDDDFA5D532C852572BF0046B776/$file/2007%20CARTS%20-%20Reduced%20Microphonics%20and%20Sound%20Emissions.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitive electronic preamplifiers generally use class 1 capacitors to avoid this effect.

In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. High current impulse loads or high ripple currents can generate audible acoustic sound coming from the capacitor, but discharges the capacitor and stresses the dielectric.&lt;ref&gt;Kemet,
[http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/242F5F2E69DCEC7485256EDF004CA495 Are your military ceramic capacitors subject to the piezoelectric effect?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619003041/http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/242F5F2E69DCEC7485256EDF004CA495 |date=June 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soldering===
Ceramic capacitors may experience changes to their electrical parameters due to soldering stress. The heat of the solder bath, especially for SMD styles, can cause changes of contact resistance between terminals and electrodes. For ferroelectric class 2 ceramic capacitors, the soldering temperature is above the [[Curie point]]. The polarized domains in the dielectric are going back and the aging process of class 2 ceramic capacitors is starting again.&lt;ref name=Waugh /&gt;

Hence after soldering a recovery time of approximately 24 hours is necessary. After recovery some electrical parameters like capacitance value, ESR, leakage currents are changed irreversibly. The changes are in the lower percentage range depending on the style of capacitor.

==Additional information==

===Standardization===
The standardization for all [[electrical]], [[electronics|electronic]] components and related technologies follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/ IEC Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu IEC Webstore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beuth.de/de/ IEC/EN/DIN Standards, Beuth-Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for [[capacitor]]s for use in electronic equipment are set out in the generic specification:
* IEC 60384-1, Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Part 1: Generic specification

The tests and requirements to be met by ceramic capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the following sectional specifications:

===Tantalum capacitor replacement===

Multilayer ceramic capacitors are increasingly used to replace [[tantalum capacitor|tantalum]] and low capacitance aluminium [[electrolytic capacitor|electrolytic]] capacitors in applications such as bypass or high frequency [[switched-mode power supplies]] as their cost, reliability and size becomes competitive. In many applications, their low ESR allows the use of a lower nominal capacitance value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://powerelectronics.com/mag/power_multilayer_ceramics_tantalums/ Power Electronics Technology - Multilayer Ceramics or Tantalums]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johanson dielectrics, "Advanced Ceramic Solutions", Tantalum Replacement [http://www.johansondielectrics.com/images/stories/tech-notes/application/JDI_Tanceram-Apps_3-03.pdf PDF]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Texas Instruments, Ceramic Capacitors Replace Tantalum Capacitors in LDOs, Application Report SLVA214A–August 2005–Revised October 2006 [http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva214a/slva214a.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rutronik, Guideline for replacing a tantalum capacitor with a MLCC [http://www.rutronik.com/fileadmin/downloads/printmedia/products/02_passive/ceramic_capacitors_en.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710121659/http://www.rutronik.com/fileadmin/downloads/printmedia/products/02_passive/ceramic_capacitors_en.pdf |date=2015-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemet, How do I choose between a polymer aluminum, ceramic and tantalum capacitor? {{cite web|url=http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/0CBE2E5238A759A385256A8700515CCD?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102205/http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/0CBE2E5238A759A385256A8700515CCD?OpenDocument |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features and disadvantages of ceramic capacitors===
For features and disadvantages of ceramic capacitors see main article [[Types of capacitor#Capacitor features comparisons]]

==Marking==
{{See also|Preferred number#E series}}

===Imprinted markings===
If space permits ceramic capacitors, like most other electronic components, have imprinted markings to indicate the manufacturer, the type, their electrical and thermal characteristics and their date of manufacture. In the ideal case, if they are large enough, the capacitor will be marked with:
* manufacturer's name or trademark;
* manufacturer's type designation;
* rated capacitance;
* tolerance on rated capacitance
* rated voltage and nature of supply (AC or DC)
* climatic category or rated temperature;
* year and month (or week) of manufacture;
* certification marks of safety standards (for safety EMI/RFI suppression capacitors)

Smaller capacitors use a shorthand notation, to display all the relevant information in the limited space. The most commonly used format is: XYZ J/K/M VOLTS V, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY × 10&lt;sup&gt;Z&lt;/sup&gt; pF), the letters J, K or M indicate the tolerance (±5%, ±10% and ±20% respectively) and VOLTS V represents the working voltage.

====Examples====
* A capacitor with the following text on its body: '''105K 330V''' has a capacitance of 10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 1 µF (K = ±10%) with a working voltage of 330 V.
* A capacitor with the following text: '''473M 100V''' has a capacitance of 47 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 47 nF (M = ±20%) with a working voltage of 100 V.

Capacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be identified with a short code according to [[IEC/EN 60062]]. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads):
* µ47 = 0.47 µF
* 4µ7 = 4.7 µF
* 47µ = 47 µF

The date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards.
* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, "1208" is  "2012, week number 8".
* Version 2: coding with year code/month code,
Year code: "R" = 2003, "S"= 2004, "T" = 2005, "U" = 2006, "V" = 2007, "W" = 2008, "X" = 2009, "A" = 2010, "B" = 2011, "C" = 2012, "D" = 2013 etc.

Month code: "1" to "9" = Jan. to Sept., "O" = October, "N" = November, "D" = December

"X5" is then "2009, May"

For very small capacitors like MLCC chips no marking is possible. Here only the traceability of the manufacturers can ensure the identification of a type.

===Colour coding===

A '''chemical element''' is a [[chemical species|species]] of [[atom]]s having the same number of [[proton]]s in their [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] (that is, the same [[atomic number]], or ''Z'').&lt;ref name="goldbookElement"&gt;{{cite book| website= International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry| chapter-url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01022.html| editor=[[IUPAC]]| doi=10.1351/goldbook.C01022| title=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology| year=2009| isbn=978-0967855097| chapter=Chemical element}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the atomic number of [[oxygen]] is 8, so the element oxygen consists of all atoms which have exactly 8 protons.

118 elements have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on [[Earth]] with the remaining 24 being [[synthetic element]]s. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable [[isotope]] and 38 that have exclusively [[radionuclide]]s, which [[Radioactive decay|decay]] over time into other elements. [[Iron]] is the [[abundances of the elements (data page)|most abundant element]] (by [[mass]]) making up Earth, while [[oxygen]] is the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most common element in the Earth's crust]].&lt;ref name="LosAlamos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Periodic Table of Elements: Oxygen|author=Los Alamos National Laboratory|authorlink=Los Alamos National Laboratory|publisher=Los Alamos National Security, LLC|location=Los Alamos, New Mexico|year=2011|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical elements constitute all of the [[Baryon#Baryonic matter|ordinary]] [[matter]] of the universe. However [[Observational astronomy|astronomical observations]] suggest that ordinary observable matter makes up only about 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is [[dark matter]]; the composition of this is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theory of Almost Everything: The Standard Model, the Unsung Triumph of Modern Physics |last=Oerter |first=Robert |year=2006 |publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=978-0452287860 |page=223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The two lightest elements, [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], were mostly formed in the [[Big Bang]] and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements ([[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and [[boron]]) were formed mostly by [[cosmic ray spallation]], and are thus rarer than heavier elements. Formation of elements with from 6 to 26 protons occurred and continues to occur in [[main sequence]] stars via [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. The high abundance of oxygen, [[silicon]], and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than 26 protons are formed by [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] in [[supernova]]e, which, when they explode, blast these elements as [[supernova remnant]]s far into space, where they may become incorporated into [[planet]]s when they are formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synthesis of the Elements in Stars|author1=E.M. Burbidge |author2=G.R. Burbidge |author3=W.A. Fowler |author4=F. Hoyle |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=29|issue=4|pages=547–650|year=1957|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.547|bibcode=1957RvMP...29..547B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "element" is used for atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether or not they are [[Ionization|ionized]] or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in [[water]]) as well as for a pure [[chemical substance]] consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas).&lt;ref name="goldbookElement"/&gt; For the second meaning, the terms "elementary substance" and "simple substance" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in [[English language|English]] chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|corps simple}}'', [[Russian language|Russian]] ''{{lang|ru|простое вещество}}''). A single element can form multiple substances differing in their structure; they are called [[Allotropy|allotropes]] of the element.

When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by [[chemical bond]]s, they form [[chemical compound]]s. Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure [[mineral]]s. Among the more common of such [[native element minerals|native elements]] are [[copper]], [[silver]], [[gold]], [[carbon]] (as [[coal]], [[graphite]], or [[diamond]]s), and [[sulfur]]. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as [[noble gas]]es and [[noble metal]]s, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] is primarily a mixture of [[nitrogen]], oxygen, and [[argon]], and native solid elements occur in [[alloy]]s, such as that of iron and nickel.

The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] [[society|human societies]] that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their [[ore]]s by [[smelting]], using [[charcoal]]. [[List of alchemists|Alchemists]] and [[chemist]]s subsequently identified many more; all of the naturally occurring elements were known by 1950.

The properties of the chemical elements are summarized in the [[periodic table]], which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ([[period (periodic table)|"periods"]]) in which the columns ([[group (periodic table)|"groups"]]) share recurring ("periodic") [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]]. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short [[half-life|half-lives]], all of the elements are available [[industry|industrially]], most of them in low degrees of [[impurity|impurities]].

==Description==
The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and [[helium]], both created by [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] during the [[Chronology of the universe|first 20 minutes of the universe]]&lt;ref&gt;See the timeline on p.10 in {{cite journal|year=2006|title=Evidence for Dark Matter|url=http://gaitskell.brown.edu/physics/talks/0408_SLAC_SummerSchool/Gaitskell_DMEvidence_v16.pdf|journal=[[Physical Review C]]|volume=74|issue=4|pages=044602|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.74.044602|bibcode=2006PhRvC..74d4602O|last1=Oganessian|first1=Yu.

Almost all other elements found in nature were made by various natural methods of [[nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foothill.edu/attach/938/Nucleosynthesis.pdf | title =How Stars Make Energy and New Elements | author =foothill.edu | publisher =''[[Foothill College]]'' | date =18 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, small amounts of new atoms are naturally produced in [[nucleogenic]] reactions, or in [[Environmental radioactivity#Natural|cosmogenic]] processes, such as [[cosmic ray spallation]]. New atoms are also naturally produced on Earth as [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic]] [[Decay product|daughter isotopes]] of ongoing [[radioactive decay]] processes such as [[alpha decay]], [[beta decay]], [[spontaneous fission]], [[cluster decay]], and other rarer modes of decay.

Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 82 each have at least one [[stable nuclide|stable isotope]] (except for [[technetium]], element 43 and [[promethium]], element 61, which have no stable isotopes). Isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are [[Radionuclide|unstable]] to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these elements, notably [[bismuth]] (atomic number 83), [[thorium]] (atomic number 90), and [[uranium]] (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] that produced the [[heavy metals]] before the formation of our [[Solar System]]. At over 1.9{{e|19}} years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, [[bismuth-209]] (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element, and is almost always considered on par with the 80 stable elements.&lt;ref name=Dume2003&gt;{{cite news|title=Bismuth breaks half-life record for alpha decay|last=Dumé|first=B.|date=23 April 2003|work=Physicsworld.com|publisher=Institute of Physics|location=Bristol, England|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2003/apr/23/bismuth-breaks-half-life-record-for-alpha-decay|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marcillac2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Marcillac|first=P.|last2=Coron|first2=N.|last3=Dambier |first3=G.|last4=Leblanc|first4=J.|last5=Moalic|first5=J-P|year=2003|title=Experimental detection of alpha-particles from the radioactive decay of natural bismuth|journal=Nature|volume=422|pages=876–8|doi=10.1038/nature01541|pmid=12712201|issue=6934|bibcode=2003Natur.422..876D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very heaviest elements (those beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive decay with [[half-life|half-lives]] so short that they are not found in nature and must be [[synthetic element|synthesized]].

As of 2010, there are 118 known elements (in this context, "known" means observed well enough, even from just a few decay products, to have been differentiated from other elements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanderson|first=K.|date=17 October 2006|title=Heaviest element made – again|journal=News@nature|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061016/full/061016-4.html|doi=10.1038/news061016-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schewe&gt;{{cite web|last=Schewe |first=P. |last2=Stein |first2=B. |date=17 October 2000 |title=Elements 116 and 118 Are Discovered |url=http://www.aip.org/pnu/2006/797.html |work=Physics News Update |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |accessdate=19 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101144201/http://www.aip.org/pnu/2006/797.html |archivedate=1 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 118 elements, 94 occur naturally on Earth. Six of these occur in extreme trace quantities: [[technetium]], atomic number 43; [[promethium]], number 61; [[astatine]], number 85; [[francium]], number 87; [[neptunium]], number 93; and [[plutonium]], number 94. These 94 elements have been detected in the universe at large, in the spectra of stars and also supernovae, where short-lived radioactive elements are newly being made. The first 94 elements have been detected directly on Earth as [[primordial nuclide]]s present from the formation of the solar system, or as naturally occurring fission or transmutation products of uranium and thorium.

The remaining 24 heavier elements, not found today either on Earth or in astronomical spectra, have been produced artificially: these are all radioactive, with very short half-lives; if any atoms of these elements were present at the formation of Earth, they are extremely likely, to the point of certainty, to have already decayed, and if present in novae, have been in quantities too small to have been noted. Technetium was the first purportedly non-naturally occurring element synthesized, in 1937, although trace amounts of technetium have since been found in nature (and also the element may have been discovered naturally in 1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/technetium.html | title =Technetium-99 | publisher =epa.gov | author =''[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'' | accessdate =26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of artificial production and later natural discovery has been repeated with several other radioactive naturally occurring rare elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/text/text_stel_6.html | title =Origins of Heavy Elements| publisher =cfa.harvard.edu | author =''[[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]]'' | accessdate =26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of chemical elements|List of the elements are available by name, atomic number, density, melting point, boiling point]] and [[Symbol (chemical element)|by symbol]], as well as [[Molar ionization energies of the elements|ionization energies of the elements]]. The nuclides of stable and radioactive elements are also available as a [[list of nuclides]], sorted by length of half-life for those that are unstable. One of the most convenient, and certainly the most traditional presentation of the elements, is in the form of the [[periodic table]], which groups together elements with similar chemical properties (and usually also similar electronic structures).

===Atomic number===
{{main|atomic number}}
The [[atomic number]] of an element is equal to the number of protons in each atom, and defines the element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/HighSchool/Radiography/atomicmassnumber.htm | title =Atomic Number and Mass Numbers | publisher =ndt-ed.org |accessdate =17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all carbon atoms contain 6 protons in their [[atomic nucleus]]; so the atomic number of carbon is 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/6.shtml | title =Periodic Table of Elements: LANL Carbon | author =periodic.lanl.gov | publisher =''[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon atoms may have different numbers of neutrons; atoms of the same element having different numbers of neutrons are known as [[isotope]]s of the element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://faculty.piercecollege.edu/yamadak/classes/Atomic%20mass.pdf | title =Atomic mass, isotopes, and mass number. | author =Katsuya Yamada | publisher =''[[Los Angeles Pierce College]]'' | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140111131537/http://faculty.piercecollege.edu/yamadak/classes/Atomic%20mass.pdf | archivedate =11 January 2014 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of protons in the atomic nucleus also determines its [[electric charge]], which in turn determines the number of [[electron]]s of the atom in its [[ionization|non-ionized]] state. The electrons are placed into [[atomic orbital]]s that determine the atom's various [[chemical property|chemical properties]]. The number of neutrons in a nucleus usually has very little effect on an element's chemical properties (except in the case of [[hydrogen]] and [[deuterium]]). Thus, all carbon isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties because they all have six protons and six electrons, even though carbon atoms may, for example, have 6 or 8 neutrons. That is why the atomic number, rather than [[mass number]] or [[atomic weight]], is considered the identifying characteristic of a chemical element.

The symbol for atomic number is ''Z''.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotope|Stable isotope ratio|List of nuclides}}
[[Isotope]]s are atoms of the same element (that is, with the same number of [[proton]]s in their [[atomic nucleus]]), but having ''different'' numbers of [[neutron]]s. Thus, for example, there are three main isotopes of carbon. All carbon atoms have 6 protons in the nucleus, but they can have either 6, 7, or 8 neutrons. Since the mass numbers of these are 12, 13 and 14 respectively, the three isotopes of carbon are known as [[carbon-12]], [[carbon-13]], and [[carbon-14]], often abbreviated to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. [[Carbon]] in everyday life and in chemistry is a [[mixture]] of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C (about 98.9%), &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C (about 1.1%) and about 1 atom per trillion of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C.

Most (66 of 94) naturally occurring elements have more than one stable isotope. Except for the isotopes of hydrogen (which differ greatly from each other in relative mass—enough to cause chemical effects), the isotopes of a given element are chemically nearly indistinguishable.

All of the elements have some isotopes that are radioactive ([[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]]), although not all of these radioisotopes occur naturally. The radioisotopes typically decay into other elements upon radiating an [[Alpha particle|alpha]] or [[beta particle]]. If an element has isotopes that are not radioactive, these are termed "stable" isotopes. All of the known stable isotopes occur naturally (see [[primordial nuclide|primordial isotope]]). The many radioisotopes that are not found in nature have been characterized after being artificially made. Certain elements have no stable isotopes and are composed ''only'' of radioactive isotopes: specifically the elements without any stable isotopes are technetium (atomic number 43), promethium (atomic number 61), and all observed elements with atomic numbers greater than 82.

Of the 80 elements with at least one stable isotope, 26 have only one single stable isotope. The mean number of stable isotopes for the 80 stable elements is 3.1 stable isotopes per element. The largest number of stable isotopes that occur for a single element is 10 (for tin, element 50).

===Isotopic mass and atomic mass===
{{main|atomic mass|relative atomic mass}}

The [[mass number]] of an element, ''A'', is the number of [[nucleon]]s (protons and neutrons) in the atomic nucleus. Different isotopes of a given element are distinguished by their mass numbers, which are conventionally written as a superscript on the left hand side of the atomic symbol (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U). The mass number is always a whole number and has units of "nucleons". For example, [[Isotopes of magnesium|magnesium-24]] (24 is the mass number) is an atom with 24 nucleons (12 protons and 12 neutrons).

Whereas the mass number simply counts the total number of neutrons and protons and is thus a natural (or whole) number, the [[atomic mass]] of a single atom is a [[real number]] giving the mass of a particular isotope (or "nuclide") of the element, expressed in [[atomic mass unit]]s (symbol: u). In general, the mass number of a given nuclide differs in value slightly from its atomic mass, since the mass of each proton and neutron is not exactly 1&amp;nbsp;u; since the electrons contribute a lesser share to the atomic mass as neutron number exceeds proton number; and (finally) because of the [[nuclear binding energy]]. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine-35 to five significant digits is 34.969&amp;nbsp;u and that of chlorine-37 is 36.966&amp;nbsp;u. However, the atomic mass in u of each isotope is quite close to its simple mass number (always within 1%). The only isotope whose atomic mass is exactly a [[natural number]] is &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, which by definition has a mass of exactly 12, because u is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a free neutral carbon-12 atom in the ground state.

The [[standard atomic weight]] (commonly called "atomic weight") of an element is the ''average'' of the atomic masses of all the chemical element's isotopes as found in a particular environment, weighted by isotopic abundance, relative to the atomic mass unit. This number may be a fraction that is ''not'' close to a whole number. For example, the relative atomic mass of chlorine is 35.453&amp;nbsp;u, which differs greatly from a whole number as it is an average of about 76% chlorine-35 and 24% chlorine-37. Whenever a relative atomic mass value differs by more than 1% from a whole number, it is due to this averaging effect, as significant amounts of more than one isotope are naturally present in a sample of that element.

===Chemically pure and isotopically pure===
Chemists and nuclear scientists have different definitions of a ''pure element''. In chemistry, a pure element means a substance whose atoms all (or in practice almost all) have the same [[atomic number]], or number of [[proton]]s. Nuclear scientists, however, define a pure element as one that consists of only one stable [[isotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/p/pure-element.htm |title=Pure element |publisher=[[European Nuclear Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a copper wire is 99.99% chemically pure if 99.99% of its atoms are copper, with 29 protons each. However it is not isotopically pure since ordinary copper consists of two stable isotopes, 69% &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu and 31% &lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;Cu, with different numbers of neutrons. However, a pure gold ingot would be both chemically and isotopically pure, since ordinary gold consists only of one isotope, &lt;sup&gt;197&lt;/sup&gt;Au.

===Allotropes===
{{Main|Allotropy}}
Atoms of chemically pure elements may bond to each other chemically in more than one way, allowing the pure element to exist in multiple [[chemical structure]]s ([[Molecular geometry|spatial arrangements of atoms]]), known as [[Allotropy|allotropes]], which differ in their properties. For example, carbon can be found as [[diamond]], which has a tetrahedral structure around each carbon atom; [[graphite]], which has layers of carbon atoms with a hexagonal structure stacked on top of each other; [[graphene]], which is a single layer of graphite that is very strong; [[fullerene]]s, which have nearly spherical shapes; and [[carbon nanotube]]s, which are tubes with a hexagonal structure (even these may differ from each other in electrical properties). The ability of an element to exist in one of many structural forms is known as 'allotropy'.

The [[standard state]], also known as reference state, of an element is defined as its thermodynamically most stable state at a pressure of 1 [[bar (unit)|bar]] and a given temperature (typically at 298.15&amp;nbsp;K). In [[thermochemistry]], an element is defined to have an [[Standard enthalpy of formation|enthalpy of formation]] of zero in its standard state. For example, the reference state for carbon is graphite, because the structure of graphite is more stable than that of the other allotropes.

===Properties===
Several kinds of descriptive categorizations can be applied broadly to the elements, including consideration of their general physical and chemical properties, their states of matter under familiar conditions, their melting and boiling points, their densities, their crystal structures as solids, and their origins.

====General properties====
Several terms are commonly used to characterize the general physical and chemical properties of the chemical elements. A first distinction is between [[metal]]s, which readily conduct [[electricity]], [[nonmetal]]s, which do not, and a small group, (the ''[[metalloid]]s''), having intermediate properties and often behaving as [[semiconductor]]s.

A more refined classification is often shown in colored presentations of the periodic table. This system restricts the terms "metal" and "nonmetal" to only certain of the more broadly defined metals and nonmetals, adding additional terms for certain sets of the more broadly viewed metals and nonmetals. The version of this classification used in the periodic tables presented here includes: [[actinide]]s, [[alkali metal]]s, [[alkaline earth metal]]s, [[halogen]]s, [[lanthanide]]s, [[transition metal]]s, [[post-transition metal]]s, [[metalloid]]s, [[reactive nonmetal]]s, and [[noble gas]]es. In this system, the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and transition metals, as well as the lanthanides and the actinides, are special groups of the metals viewed in a broader sense. Similarly, the reactive nonmetals and the noble gases are nonmetals viewed in the broader sense. In some presentations, the halogens are not distinguished, with [[astatine]] identified as a metalloid and the others identified as nonmetals.

====States of matter====
Another commonly used basic distinction among the elements is their [[state of matter]] (phase), whether [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]], at a selected [[standard temperature and pressure]] (STP). Most of the elements are solids at conventional temperatures and atmospheric pressure, while several are gases. Only [[bromine]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are liquids at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) and normal atmospheric pressure; [[caesium]] and [[gallium]] are solids at that temperature, but melt at 28.4&amp;nbsp;°C (83.2&amp;nbsp;°F) and 29.8&amp;nbsp;°C (85.6&amp;nbsp;°F), respectively.

====Melting and boiling points====
[[Melting point|Melting]] and [[boiling point]]s, typically expressed in [[Celsius|degrees Celsius]] at a pressure of one atmosphere, are commonly used in characterizing the various elements. While known for most elements, either or both of these measurements is still undetermined for some of the radioactive elements available in only tiny quantities. Since [[helium]] remains a liquid even at [[absolute zero]] at atmospheric pressure, it has only a boiling point, and not a melting point, in conventional presentations.

====Densities====
{{Main|Densities of the elements (data page)}}
The [[density]] at a selected standard temperature and pressure ([[standard temperature and pressure|STP]]) is frequently used in characterizing the elements. Density is often expressed in [[gram]]s per cubic centimeter (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Since several elements are gases at commonly encountered temperatures, their densities are usually stated for their gaseous forms; when liquefied or solidified, the gaseous elements have densities similar to those of the other elements.

When an element has [[Allotropy|allotropes]] with different densities, one representative allotrope is typically selected in summary presentations, while densities for each allotrope can be stated where more detail is provided. For example, the three familiar [[allotropes of carbon]] ([[amorphous carbon]], [[graphite]], and [[diamond]]) have densities of 1.8–2.1, 2.267, and 3.515&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

====Crystal structures====
{{Main|Crystal structure}}
The elements studied to date as solid samples have eight kinds of [[crystal structure]]s: [[cubic crystal system|cubic]], [[cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]], [[cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]], [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]], [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]], [[orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]], [[Trigonal crystal system|rhombohedral]], and [[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]]. For some of the synthetically produced transuranic elements, available samples have been too small to determine crystal structures.

====Occurrence and origin on Earth====
Chemical elements may also be categorized by their origin on Earth, with the first 94 considered naturally occurring, while those with atomic numbers beyond 94 have only been produced artificially as the synthetic products of man-made nuclear reactions.

Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are considered [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] and either [[stable isotope|stable]] or weakly radioactive. The remaining 11 naturally occurring elements possess [[Half-life|half lives]] too short for them to have been present at the beginning of the [[Solar System]], and are therefore considered transient elements. Of these 11 transient elements, 5 ([[polonium]], [[radon]], [[radium]], [[actinium]], and [[protactinium]]) are relatively common [[decay products]] of [[thorium]] and [[uranium]]. The remaining 6 transient elements ([[technetium]], [[promethium]], [[astatine]], [[francium]], [[neptunium]], and [[plutonium]]) occur only rarely, as products of rare decay modes or nuclear reaction processes involving uranium or other heavy elements.

Elements with atomic numbers 1 through 40 are all stable, while those with atomic numbers 41 through 82 (except technetium and promethium) are metastable.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The half-lives of these metastable "[[List of nuclides#Nuclides with no experimentally observed decays|theoretical radionuclides]]" are so long (at least 100 million times longer than the estimated [[age of the universe]]) that their radioactive decay has yet to be detected by experiment. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that their radioactive decay can be detected. Three of these elements, bismuth (element 83), thorium (element 90), and uranium (element 92) have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] that produced the heavy elements before the formation of our solar system. For example, at over 1.9{{e|19}} years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, [[bismuth-209]] has the longest known [[alpha decay]] half-life of any naturally occurring element.&lt;ref name="Dume2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marcillac2003/&gt; The very heaviest 24 elements (those beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive decay with short half-lives and cannot be produced as daughters of longer-lived elements, and thus they do not occur in nature at all.

===Periodic table===
{{Main|Periodic table}}
{{Periodic table}}

The properties of the chemical elements are often summarized using the [[periodic table]], which powerfully and elegantly organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ([[period (periodic table)|"periods"]]) in which the columns ([[group (periodic table)|"groups"]]) share recurring ("periodic") physical and chemical properties. The current standard table contains 118 confirmed elements as of 10 April 2010.

Although earlier precursors to this presentation exist, its invention is generally credited to the Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] in 1869, who intended the table to illustrate recurring trends in the properties of the elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time as new elements have been discovered and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior.

Use of the periodic table is now ubiquitous within the academic discipline of chemistry, providing an extremely useful framework to classify, systematize and compare all the many different forms of chemical behavior. The table has also found wide application in [[physics]], [[geology]], [[biology]], [[materials science]], [[engineering]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[nutrition]], [[environmental health]], and [[astronomy]]. Its principles are especially important in [[chemical engineering]].

==Nomenclature and symbols==
{{anchor|Nomenclature}}
The various chemical elements are formally identified by their unique [[atomic number]]s, by their accepted names, and by their [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbols]].

===Atomic numbers===
The known elements have atomic numbers from 1 through 118, conventionally presented as [[Arabic numerals]]. Since the elements can be uniquely sequenced by atomic number, conventionally from lowest to highest (as in a [[periodic table]]), sets of elements are sometimes specified by such notation as "through", "beyond", or "from ... through", as in "through iron", "beyond uranium", or "from lanthanum through lutetium". The terms "light" and "heavy" are sometimes also used informally to indicate relative atomic numbers (not densities), as in "lighter than carbon" or "heavier than lead", although technically the weight or mass of atoms of an element (their atomic weights or atomic masses) do not always increase [[monotonic function|monotonically]] with their atomic numbers.

===Element names===
{{main|Naming of elements}}
The naming of various substances now known as elements precedes the [[Atomic theory|atomic theory of matter]], as names were given locally by various cultures to various minerals, metals, compounds, alloys, mixtures, and other materials, although at the time it was not known which chemicals were elements and which compounds. As they were identified as elements, the existing names for anciently-known elements (e.g., gold, mercury, iron) were kept in most countries. National differences emerged over the names of elements either for convenience, linguistic niceties, or nationalism. For a few illustrative examples: German speakers use "Wasserstoff" (water substance) for "hydrogen", "Sauerstoff" (acid substance) for "oxygen" and "Stickstoff" (smothering substance) for "nitrogen", while English and some [[romance language]]s use "sodium" for "natrium" and "potassium" for "kalium", and the French, Italians, Greeks, Portuguese and Poles prefer "azote/azot/azoto" (from roots meaning "no life") for "nitrogen".

For purposes of international communication and trade, the [[Table of chemical elements|official names of the chemical elements]] both ancient and more recently recognized are decided by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC), which has decided on a sort of international English language, drawing on traditional English names even when an element's chemical symbol is based on a Latin or other traditional word, for example adopting "gold" rather than "aurum" as the name for the 79th element (Au). IUPAC prefers the British spellings "[[aluminium]]" and "caesium" over the U.S. spellings "aluminum" and "cesium", and the U.S. "sulfur" over the British "sulphur". However, elements that are practical to sell in bulk in many countries often still have locally used national names, and countries whose national language does not use the [[Latin alphabet]] are likely to use the IUPAC element names.

According to IUPAC, chemical elements are not proper nouns in English; consequently, the full name of an element is not routinely capitalized in English, even if derived from a [[proper noun]], as in [[californium]] and [[einsteinium]]. Isotope names of chemical elements are also uncapitalized if written out, ''e.g.,'' [[carbon-12]] or [[uranium-235]]. Chemical element ''symbols'' (such as Cf for californium and Es for einsteinium), are always capitalized (see below).

In the second half of the twentieth century, physics laboratories became able to produce nuclei of chemical elements with half-lives too short for an appreciable amount of them to exist at any time. These are also named by IUPAC, which generally adopts the name chosen by the discoverer. This practice can lead to the controversial question of which research group actually discovered an element, a question that delayed the naming of elements with atomic number of 104 and higher for a considerable amount of time. (See [[element naming controversy]]).

Precursors of such controversies involved the nationalistic namings of elements in the late 19th century. For example, ''[[lutetium]]'' was named in reference to Paris, France. The Germans were reluctant to relinquish naming rights to the French, often calling it ''cassiopeium''. Similarly, the British discoverer of ''[[niobium]]'' originally named it ''columbium,'' in reference to the [[New World]]. It was used extensively as such by American publications before the international standardization (in 1950).

===Chemical symbols===
{{For|listings of current chemical symbols, symbols not currently used, and other symbols that may look like chemical symbols|Symbol (chemistry)}}

====Specific chemical elements====
Before chemistry became a [[science]], [[alchemy|alchemists]] had designed arcane symbols for both metals and common compounds. These were however used as abbreviations in diagrams or procedures; there was no concept of atoms combining to form [[molecule]]s. With his advances in the atomic theory of matter, [[John Dalton]] devised his own simpler symbols, based on circles, to depict molecules.

The current system of chemical notation was invented by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Berzelius]]. In this typographical system, chemical symbols are not mere abbreviations—though each consists of letters of the [[Latin alphabet]]. They are intended as universal symbols for people of all languages and alphabets.

The first of these symbols were intended to be fully universal. Since Latin was the common language of science at that time, they were abbreviations based on the [[Latin]] names of metals. Cu comes from Cuprum, Fe comes from Ferrum, Ag from Argentum. The symbols were not followed by a period (full stop) as with abbreviations. Later chemical elements were also assigned unique chemical symbols, based on the name of the element, but not necessarily in English. For example, [[sodium]] has the chemical symbol 'Na' after the Latin ''natrium''. The same applies to "W" (wolfram) for [[tungsten]], "Fe" (ferrum) for [[iron]], "Hg" (hydrargyrum) for [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], "Sn" (stannum) for [[tin]], "K" (kalium) for [[potassium]], "Au" (aurum) for [[gold]], "Ag" (argentum) for [[silver]], "Pb" (plumbum) for [[lead]], "Cu" (cuprum) for [[copper]], and "Sb" (stibium) for [[antimony]].

Chemical symbols are understood internationally when element names might require translation. There have sometimes been differences in the past. For example, Germans in the past have used "J" (for the alternate name Jod) for iodine, but now use "I" and "Iod".

The first letter of a chemical symbol is always capitalized, as in the preceding examples, and the subsequent letters, if any, are always lower case (small letters). Thus, the symbols for californium and einsteinium are Cf and Es.

====General chemical symbols====
There are also symbols in chemical equations for groups of chemical elements, for example in comparative formulas. These are often a single capital letter, and the letters are reserved and not used for names of specific elements. For example, an "'''X'''" indicates a variable group (usually a [[halogen]]) in a class of compounds, while "'''R'''" is a [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], meaning a compound structure such as a hydrocarbon chain. The letter "'''Q'''" is reserved for "heat" in a chemical reaction. "'''Y'''" is also often used as a general chemical symbol, although it is also the symbol of [[yttrium]]. "'''Z'''" is also frequently used as a general variable group. "'''E'''" is used in organic chemistry to denote an [[Polar effect|electron-withdrawing group]] or an [[electrophile]]; similarly "'''Nu'''" denotes a [[nucleophile]]. "'''L'''" is used to represent a general [[ligand]] in [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] and [[organometallic chemistry]]. "'''M'''" is also often used in place of a general metal.

At least two additional, two-letter generic chemical symbols are also in informal usage, "'''Ln'''" for any [[lanthanide]] element and "'''An'''" for any [[actinide]] element. "'''Rg'''" was formerly used for any [[rare gas]] element, but the group of rare gases has now been renamed [[noble gas]]es and the symbol "'''Rg'''" has now been assigned to the element [[roentgenium]].

====Isotope symbols====
Isotopes are distinguished by the atomic mass number (total protons and neutrons) for a particular isotope of an element, with this number combined with the pertinent element's symbol. IUPAC prefers that isotope symbols be written in superscript notation when practical, for example &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. However, other notations, such as carbon-12 and uranium-235, or C-12 and U-235, are also used.

As a special case, the three naturally occurring isotopes of the element [[hydrogen]] are often specified as '''H''' for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H ([[Isotopes of hydrogen#Hydrogen-1 (protium)|protium]]), '''D''' for &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H ([[deuterium]]), and '''T''' for &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H ([[tritium]]). This convention is easier to use in chemical equations, replacing the need to write out the mass number for each atom. For example, the formula for [[heavy water]] may be written D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O instead of &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

==Origin of the elements==
[[File:Universe content pie chart.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Estimated distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe. Only the fraction of the mass and energy in the universe labeled "atoms" is composed of chemical elements.]]

Only about 4% of the total mass of the universe is made of atoms or [[ion]]s, and thus represented by chemical elements. This fraction is about 15% of the total matter, with the remainder of the matter (85%) being [[dark matter]]. The nature of dark matter is unknown, but it is not composed of atoms of chemical elements because it contains no protons, neutrons, or electrons. (The remaining non-matter part of the mass of the universe is composed of the even more mysterious [[dark energy]]).

The universe's 94 naturally occurring chemical elements are thought to have been produced by at least four [[cosmos|cosmic]] processes. Most of the [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and a very small quantity of [[lithium]]in the universe was produced primordially in the first few minutes of the [[Big Bang]]. Other three recurrently occurring later processes are thought to have produced the remaining elements. [[Stellar nucleosynthesis]], an ongoing process inside stars, produces all elements from [[carbon]] through [[iron]] in atomic number, but little [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], or [[boron]]. Elements heavier in atomic number than iron, as heavy as [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]], are produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in [[supernova]]s and other cataclysmic cosmic events. [[Cosmic ray spallation]] (fragmentation) of carbon, [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] is important to the production of lithium, beryllium and boron.

During the early phases of the Big Bang, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] of hydrogen nuclei resulted in the production of hydrogen-1 ([[Isotopes of hydrogen#Hydrogen-1 (protium)|protium]], &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) and helium-4 (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He), as well as a smaller amount of [[deuterium]] (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) and very minuscule amounts (on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;) of lithium and beryllium. Even smaller amounts of boron may have been produced in the Big Bang, since it has been observed in some very old stars, while carbon has not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilford|first=J.N.|date=14 January 1992|title=Hubble Observations Bring Some Surprises|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D91F3AF937A25752C0A964958260|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally agreed that no heavier elements than boron were produced in the Big Bang. As a result, the primordial abundance of atoms (or ions) consisted of roughly 75% &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, 25% &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, and 0.01% deuterium, with only tiny traces of lithium, beryllium, and perhaps boron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=E.

[[File:Nucleosynthesis periodic table.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|Periodic table showing the cosmogenic origin of each element in the Big Bang, or in large or small stars. Small stars can produce certain elements up to sulfur, by the [[alpha process]]. Supernovae are needed to produce "heavy" elements (those beyond iron and nickel) rapidly by neutron buildup, in the [[r-process]]. Certain large stars slowly produce other elements heavier than iron, in the [[s-process]]; these may then be blown into space in the off-gassing of [[planetary nebulae]]]]

On Earth (and elsewhere), trace amounts of various elements continue to be produced from other elements as products of [[nuclear transmutation]] processes. These include some produced by [[cosmic ray]]s or other nuclear reactions (see [[cosmogenic nuclide|cosmogenic]] and [[nucleogenic]] nuclides), and others produced as [[decay product]]s of long-lived [[primordial nuclide]]s.&lt;ref name=Earnshaw1997&gt;{{cite book|last=Earnshaw|first=A.|last2=Greenwood|first2=N.|year=1997|title=Chemistry of the Elements|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, trace (but detectable) amounts of [[carbon-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C) are continually produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays impacting [[nitrogen]] atoms, and argon-40 (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar) is continually produced by the decay of primordially occurring but unstable potassium-40 (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K). Also, three primordially occurring but radioactive [[actinide]]s, [[thorium]], uranium, and plutonium, decay through a series of recurrently produced but unstable radioactive elements such as radium and [[radon]], which are transiently present in any sample of these metals or their ores or compounds. Three other radioactive elements, [[technetium]], [[promethium]], and [[neptunium]], occur only incidentally in natural materials, produced as individual atoms by [[nuclear fission]] of the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of various heavy elements or in other rare nuclear processes.

[[Human]] [[technology]] has produced various additional elements beyond these first 94, with those through atomic number 118 now known.

==Abundance==
{{Main|Abundance of the chemical elements}}

The following graph (note log scale) shows the abundance of elements in our [[Solar System]]. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy (estimated spectroscopically), as measured in [[Parts-per notation|parts per million]], by [[mass]].&lt;ref name=croswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Croswell|first=K.|year=1996|title=Alchemy of the Heavens|url=http://kencroswell.com/alchemy.html|publisher=Anchor|isbn=978-0385472142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. As physical laws and processes appear common throughout the [[visible universe]], however, scientist expect that these galaxies evolved elements in similar abundance.

The abundance of elements in the Solar System is in keeping with their origin from nucleosynthesis in the [[Big Bang]] and a number of progenitor supernova stars. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big Bang, but the next three elements are rare since they had little time to form in the Big Bang and are not made in stars (they are, however, produced in small quantities by the breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust, as a result of impact by [[cosmic ray]]s). Beginning with carbon, elements are produced in stars by buildup from alpha particles (helium nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). In general, such elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming [[supernova]]s. Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of decay of radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars, and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with their atomic number.

The [[abundance of the chemical elements]] on '''Earth''' varies from air to crust to ocean, and in various types of life. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust differs from that in the Solar system (as seen in the Sun and heavy planets like Jupiter) mainly in selective loss of the very lightest elements (hydrogen and helium) and also volatile neon, carbon (as hydrocarbons), nitrogen and sulfur, as a result of solar heating in the early formation of the solar system. Oxygen, the most abundant Earth element by mass, is retained on Earth by combination with silicon. Aluminum at 8% by mass is more common in the Earth's crust than in the universe and solar system, but the composition of the far more bulky mantle, which has magnesium and iron in place of aluminum (which occurs there only at 2% of mass) more closely mirrors the elemental composition of the solar system, save for the noted loss of volatile elements to space, and loss of iron which has migrated to the Earth's core.

The [[composition of the human body]], by contrast, more closely follows the composition of [[seawater]]—save that the human body has additional stores of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] necessary to form the [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s, together with [[phosphorus]] in the nucleic acids and energy transfer molecule [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) that occurs in the cells of all living organisms. Certain kinds of [[organism]]s require particular additional elements, for example the [[magnesium]] in [[chlorophyll]] in green plants, the [[calcium]] in [[mollusc shell]]s, or the [[iron]] in the [[hemoglobin]] in [[vertebrate|vertebrate animals]]' [[red blood cell]]s.

[[File:SolarSystemAbundances.png|thumb|upright=2.7|Abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar system. Hydrogen and helium are most common, from the Big Bang. The next three elements (Li, Be, B) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers (the [[Oddo-Harkins rule]]), and (2) a general decrease in abundance as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae.]]

==History&lt;!--linked from 'Classical element'--&gt;==
[[File:Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Mendeleev]]'s 1869 [[periodic table]]: ''An experiment on a system of elements. Based on their atomic weights and chemical similarities.'']]

===Evolving definitions===
The concept of an "element" as an undivisible substance has developed through three major historical phases: Classical definitions (such as those of the ancient Greeks), chemical definitions, and atomic definitions.

====Classical definitions====
[[Ancient philosophy]] posited a set of [[classical element]]s to explain observed patterns in [[nature]]. These ''elements'' originally referred to ''[[Earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[Water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[Air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[Fire (classical element)|fire]]'' rather than the chemical elements of modern science.

The term 'elements' (''stoicheia'') was first used by the Greek philosopher [[Plato]] in about 360 BCE in his dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative treatise on chemistry. Plato believed the elements introduced a century earlier by [[Empedocles]] were composed of small [[regular polyhedron|polyhedral]] [[Theory of Forms|forms]]: [[tetrahedron]] (fire), [[octahedron]] (air), [[icosahedron]] (water), and [[cube]] (earth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plato|year=2008|origyear=c. 360 BC|title=Timaeus|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xSjvowNydN8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Plato%20timaeus&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=cube&amp;f=false|publisher=Forgotten Books|page=45|isbn=978-1606200186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillar |first=M. |year=2004 |title=The Problem of the Soul in Aristotle's De anima |url=http://www.socinian.org/aristotles_de_anima.html |publisher=[[NASA]]/[[WMAP]] |accessdate=10 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909004214/http://www.socinian.org/aristotles_de_anima.html |archivedate=9 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]], c. 350 BCE, also used the term ''stoicheia'' and added a fifth element called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], which formed the heavens. Aristotle defined an element as:

{{quote|Element – one of those bodies into which other bodies can decompose, and that itself is not capable of being divided into other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partington|first=J. R.|year=1937|title=A Short History of Chemistry|location=New York|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|isbn=978-0486659770}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Chemical definitions====
In 1661, [[Robert Boyle]] proposed his theory of corpuscularism which favoured the analysis of matter as constituted by irreducible units of matter (atoms) and, choosing to side with neither Aristotle's view of the four elements nor [[Paracelsus]]' view of three fundamental elements, left open the question of the number of elements.&lt;ref name=boyle/&gt; The first modern list of chemical elements was given in [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s 1789 ''[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie|Elements of Chemistry]]'', which contained thirty-three elements, including [[light]] and [[Caloric theory|caloric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavoisier|first=A. L.|year=1790|title=Elements of chemistry translated by Robert Kerr|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4BzAjCpEK4gC&amp;pg=PA175|place=Edinburgh|pages=175–6|isbn=978-0415179140}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1818, [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] had determined atomic weights for forty-five of the forty-nine then-accepted elements. [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] had sixty-six elements in his [[periodic table]] of 1869.
[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dmitri Mendeleev]]]]
From Boyle until the early 20th century, an element was defined as a pure substance that could not be decomposed into any simpler substance.&lt;ref name=boyle&gt;{{cite book|first=R.|last=Boyle|year=1661|title=The Sceptical Chymist|location=London|isbn=978-0922802906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, a chemical element cannot be transformed into other chemical elements by chemical processes. Elements during this time were generally distinguished by their atomic weights, a property measurable with fair accuracy by available analytical techniques.

====Atomic definitions====
[[File:Henry Moseley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Moseley]]]]
The 1913 discovery by English physicist [[Henry Moseley]] that the nuclear charge is the physical basis for an atom's atomic number, further refined when the nature of protons and [[neutrons]] became appreciated, eventually led to the current definition of an element based on atomic number (number of protons per atomic nucleus). The use of atomic numbers, rather than atomic weights, to distinguish elements has greater predictive value (since these numbers are integers), and also resolves some ambiguities in the chemistry-based view due to varying properties of [[isotope]]s and [[allotropes]] within the same element. Currently, [[IUPAC]] defines an element to exist if it has isotopes with a lifetime longer than the 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; seconds it takes the nucleus to form an electronic cloud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kernchemie.de/Transactinides/Transactinide-2/transactinide-2.html Transactinide-2]. www.kernchemie.de&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914, seventy-two elements were known, all naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=G.W.|year=1914|title=The Chemistry of Human Life|publisher=|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0766128408}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining naturally occurring elements were discovered or isolated in subsequent decades, and various additional elements have also been produced synthetically, with much of that work pioneered by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]]. In 1955, element 101 was discovered and named [[mendelevium]] in honor of D.I. Mendeleev, the first to arrange the elements in a periodic manner. Most recently, the synthesis of element 118 (since named [[oganesson]]) was reported in October 2006, and the synthesis of element 117 ([[tennessine]]) was reported in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glanz| first=J.|date=6 April 2010|title=Scientists Discover Heavy New Element|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/science/07element.html?hp|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery and recognition of various elements===
{{See also|Timeline of chemical elements discoveries}}

Ten materials familiar to various prehistoric cultures are now known to be chemical elements: [[Carbon]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[iron]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[silver]], [[sulfur]], [[tin]], and [[zinc]]. Three additional materials now accepted as elements, [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], and [[bismuth]], were recognized as distinct substances prior to 1500 AD. [[Phosphorus]], [[cobalt]], and [[platinum]] were isolated before 1750.

Most of the remaining naturally occurring chemical elements were identified and characterized by 1900, including:
* Such now-familiar [[industry|industrial]] materials as [[aluminium]], [[silicon]], [[nickel]], [[chromium]], [[magnesium]], and [[tungsten]]
* Reactive metals such as [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]]
* The [[halogen]]s [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and [[iodine]]
* Gases such as [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[helium]], [[argon]], and [[neon]]
* Most of the [[rare-earth elements]], including [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], [[gadolinium]], and [[neodymium]].
* The more common [[radioactive]] elements, including [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[radium]], and [[radon]]

Elements isolated or produced since 1900 include:
* The three remaining undiscovered regularly occurring stable natural elements: [[hafnium]], [[lutetium]], and [[rhenium]]
* [[Plutonium]], which was first produced synthetically in 1940 by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], but is now also known from a few long-persisting natural occurrences
* The three incidentally occurring natural elements ([[neptunium]], [[promethium]], and [[technetium]]), which were all first produced synthetically but later discovered in trace amounts in certain geological samples
* Three scarce decay products of uranium or thorium, ([[astatine]], [[francium]], and [[protactinium]]), and
* Various synthetic [[transuranic]] elements, beginning with [[americium]] and [[curium]]

===Recently discovered elements===
The first [[transuranium element]] (element with atomic number greater than 92) discovered was [[neptunium]] in 1940. Since 1999 claims for the discovery of new elements have been considered by the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party]]. As of January 2016, all 118 elements have been confirmed as discovered by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]. The discovery of element 112 was acknowledged in 2009, and the name ''copernicium'' and the atomic symbol ''Cn'' were suggested for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=20 July 2009|title=IUPAC Announces Start of the Name Approval Process for the Element of Atomic Number 112|url=http://media.iupac.org/news/112_Naming_Process_20090720.pdf|publisher=[[IUPAC]]|accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name and symbol were officially endorsed by IUPAC on 19 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=20 February 2010 |title=IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry): Element 112 is Named Copernicium |url=http://www.iupac.org/web/nt/2010-02-20_112_Copernicium |publisher=[[IUPAC]] |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224054826/http://www.iupac.org/web/nt/2010-02-20_112_Copernicium |archivedate=24 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The heaviest element that is believed to have been synthesized to date is element 118, [[oganesson]], on 9 October 2006, by the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|Flerov Laboratory]] of Nuclear Reactions in [[Dubna]], Russia.&lt;ref name=Schewe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Evidence for Dark Matter|url=http://gaitskell.brown.edu/physics/talks/0408_SLAC_SummerSchool/Gaitskell_DMEvidence_v16.pdf|journal=[[Physical Review C]]|volume=74|issue=4|pages=044602|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.74.044602|bibcode=2006PhRvC..74d4602O|last1=Oganessian|first1=Yu.

==List of the 118 known chemical elements==
The following sortable table shows the 118 known chemical elements.
* '''Atomic number''', '''name''', and '''symbol''' all serve independently as unique identifiers.
* '''Names''' are those accepted by [[IUPAC]]; provisional names for recently produced elements not yet formally named are in parentheses.
* '''Group, period,''' and '''block''' refer to an element's position in the [[periodic table]]. Group numbers here show the currently accepted numbering; for older alternate numberings, see [[Group (periodic table)]].
* '''State of matter''' ''(solid, liquid,'' or ''gas)'' applies at standard [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] conditions ([[Standard Temperature and Pressure|STP]]).
* '''Occurrence''', as indicated by a footnote adjacent to the element's name, distinguishes naturally occurring elements, categorized as either ''primordial'' or ''transient'' (from decay), and additional ''synthetic'' elements that have been produced technologically, but are not known to occur naturally.
* '''Color''' specifies an element's properties using the broad categories commonly presented in periodic tables: [[Actinide]], [[alkali metal]], [[alkaline earth metal]], [[lanthanide]], [[post-transition metal]], [[metalloid]], [[noble gas]], polyatomic or diatomic [[nonmetal]], and [[transition metal]].

'''Climate change''' is a change in the statistical distribution of [[weather]] patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time (i.e., decades to millions of years). Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather within the context of longer-term average conditions. Climate change is caused by factors such as [[wikt:biotic|biotic]] processes, variations in [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] received by Earth, [[plate tectonics]], and [[volcanic eruptions]]. Certain human activities have been identified as primary causes of ongoing climate change, often referred to as [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;

 |quote=(p1) ... there is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines of research, documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities. While much remains to be learned, the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. (pp. 21–22) Some scientific conclusions or theories have been so thoroughly examined and tested, and supported by so many independent observations and results, that their likelihood of subsequently being found to be wrong is vanishingly small. Such conclusions and theories are then regarded as settled facts. This is the case for the conclusions that the Earth system is warming and that much of this warming is very likely due to human activities.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no general agreement in scientific, media or policy documents as to the precise term to be used to refer to [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] forced change; either "global warming" or "climate change" may be used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Scientist]]s actively work to understand past and future [[climate]] by using [[Proxy (climate)|observations]] and theoretical models. A climate record—extending deep into the Earth's past—has been assembled, and continues to be built up, based on geological evidence from [[borehole]] temperature profiles, [[ice core|cores removed from deep accumulations of ice]], [[flora]]l and [[fauna]]l records, glacial and [[Periglaciation|periglacial]] processes, stable-isotope and other analyses of sediment layers, and records of past sea levels. More recent data are provided by the instrumental record. [[General circulation model]]s, based on the [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]], are often used in theoretical approaches to match past climate data, make future projections, and link causes and effects in climate change.

Factors that can shape climate are called [[climate forcing]]s or "forcing mechanisms".&lt;ref name="Smith2013" /&gt; These can be either "internal" or "external". Internal forcing mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself (e.g., the [[thermohaline circulation]]). External forcing mechanisms can be either [[Anthropogenic effect|anthropogenic]]—caused by humans—(e.g. increased [[Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions of greenhouse gases]] and dust) or natural (e.g., changes in solar output, the earth's orbit, volcano eruptions).

Physical evidence to observe climate change includes a range of parameters. Global records of surface temperature are available beginning from the mid-late 19th century. For earlier periods, most of the evidence is indirect—climatic changes are inferred from changes in [[Proxy (climate)|proxies]], indicators that reflect climate, such as [[ice core]]s,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[dendrochronology]], [[sea level change]], and [[glacial geology]]. Other physical evidence includes [[arctic sea ice decline]], cloud cover and precipitation, vegetation, animals and [[Historical impacts of climate change|historical and archaeological evidence]].

==Terminology==

The most general definition of climate change is a change in the statistical properties (principally its [[central tendency|mean]] and [[statistical variability|spread]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The term "climate change" is often used to refer specifically to anthropogenic climate change (also known as [[global warming]]). Anthropogenic climate change is caused by human activity, as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of Earth's natural processes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |date=21 March 1994 |title=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |url=http://unfccc.int/resource/ccsites/zimbab/conven/text/art01.htm |quote=''Climate change'' means a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this sense, especially in the context of [[environmental policy]], the term climate change has become synonymous with [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[global warming]]. Within scientific journals, global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing [[greenhouse gas]] levels affect.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |title=What's in a Name? Global Warming vs. Climate Change |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/climate_by_any_other_name.html |accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related term, "climatic change", was proposed by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) in 1966 to encompass all forms of climatic variability on time-scales longer than 10 years, but regardless of cause. During the 1970s, the term climate change replaced climatic change to focus on anthropogenic causes, as it became clear that human activities had a potential to drastically alter the climate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Climate change was incorporated in the title of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). Climate change is now used as both a technical description of the process, as well as a noun used to describe the problem.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hulme |first=Mike |year=2016 |title=Concept of Climate Change, in: The International Encyclopedia of Geography |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell/Association of American Geographers (AAG) |url=https://www.academia.edu/10358797/Climate_change_concept_of_ |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the broadest scale, the rate at which energy is received from the [[Sun]] and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium temperature and climate of Earth.

There are a variety of [[Climate feedback|climate change feedbacks]] that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcing. Some parts of the climate system, such as the oceans and ice caps, respond more slowly in reaction to climate forcings, while others respond more quickly. There are also key [[Ecological threshold|threshold factors]] which when exceeded can produce rapid change.

Forcing mechanisms can be either "internal" or "external". Internal forcing mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself (e.g., the [[thermohaline circulation]]). External forcing mechanisms can be either anthropogenic (e.g. increased emissions of greenhouse gases and dust) or natural (e.g., changes in solar output, the earth's orbit, volcano eruptions).

Whether the initial forcing mechanism is internal or external, the response of the climate system might be fast (e.g., a sudden cooling due to airborne [[volcanic ash]] reflecting sunlight), slow (e.g. [[thermal expansion]] of warming ocean water), or a combination (e.g., sudden loss of [[albedo]] in the Arctic Ocean as sea ice melts, followed by more gradual thermal expansion of the water). Therefore, the climate system can respond [[Abrupt climate change|abruptly]], but the full response to forcing mechanisms might not be fully developed for centuries or even longer.

===Internal forcing mechanisms===
Scientists generally define the five components of earth's climate system to include [[Earth's Atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[cryosphere]], [[lithosphere]] (restricted to the surface soils, rocks, and sediments), and [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2011 |title=Glossary |publisher=NASA Earth Observatory |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Glossary/index.php?mode=alpha&amp;seg=b&amp;segend=d |accessdate=8 July 2011 |quote=Climate System: The five physical components (atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere) that are responsible for the climate and its variations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural changes in the climate system ("internal forcings") result in internal "climate variability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=IPCC |authorlink=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |year=2007 |title=What are Climate Change and Climate Variability? |publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the type and distribution of species, and changes in ocean-atmosphere circulations.

The oceanic aspects of these circulations can generate variability on centennial timescales due to the ocean having hundreds of times more mass than in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], and thus very high [[Volumetric heat capacity|thermal inertia.]] For example, alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat in the world's oceans.

====Orbital variations====
{{Main|Milankovitch cycles}}

Slight variations in Earth's motion lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and how it is distributed across the globe. There is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine; but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution. The three types of [[Kinematics|kinematic]] change are variations in Earth's [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], changes in [[axial tilt|the tilt angle of Earth's axis of rotation]], and [[precession]] of Earth's axis. Combined together, these produce [[Milankovitch cycles]] which affect climate and are notable for their correlation to [[glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial period]]s,&lt;ref name="msu milankovitch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~geol445/hyperglac/time1/milankov.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144130/http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~geol445/hyperglac/time1/milankov.htm|archivedate=2011-07-16|title= Milankovitch Cycles and Glaciation|accessdate=2 April 2009 |publisher= University of Montana}}&lt;/ref&gt; their correlation with the advance and retreat of the [[Sahara]],&lt;ref name="msu milankovitch" /&gt; and for their [[cyclostratigraphy|appearance]] in the [[geologic record|stratigraphic record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.1989.tb00403.x|title=A Milankovitch scale for Cenomanian time|year=1989|author=Gale, Andrew S. |journal=Terra Nova |volume=1|pages=420–25|issue=5|ref=harv|bibcode=1989TeNov...1..420G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same forces as today caused climate changes 1.4 billion years ago|url=http://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Fakulteterne/Naturvidenskab/Nyheder/2015_03_10_climate_cycles|website=sdu.dk|publisher=University of Denmark.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312163250/http://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Fakulteterne/Naturvidenskab/Nyheder/2015_03_10_climate_cycles|archivedate=12 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[IPCC]] notes that Milankovitch cycles drove the [[ice age]] cycles, [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] followed temperature change "with a lag of some hundreds of years", and that as a feedback amplified temperature change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-6-1.html FAQ 6.1: What Caused the Ice Ages and Other Important Climate Changes Before the Industrial Era?] in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The depths of the ocean have a lag time in changing temperature ([[thermal inertia]] on such scale). Upon seawater temperature change, the solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the oceans changed, as well as other factors affecting air-sea CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-4.html Box 6.2: What Caused the Low Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations During Glacial Times?] in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step is to find more about these trace vapours, including whether they are of natural or human origin.

Small eruptions, with injections of less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;Mt of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, affect the atmosphere only subtly, as temperature changes are comparable with natural variability. However, because smaller eruptions occur at a much higher frequency, they too significantly affect Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name = "2004miles" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "1997graf"&gt;{{cite journal

Volcanoes are also part of the extended [[carbon cycle]]. Over very long (geological) time periods, they release carbon dioxide from the Earth's crust and mantle, counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological [[carbon dioxide sink]]s. The [[US Geological Survey]] estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities, which generate 100–300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/VolGas/volgas.html|title= Volcanic Gases and Their Effects |access-date=21 January 2008 |date=2006-01-10 |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide, including amounts released from mid-ocean ridges, volcanic arcs, and hot spot volcanoes, are only the equivalent of 3 to 5 days of human-caused output. The annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by [[Supervolcano|supererruptions]], the most recent of which was the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba eruption]] in Indonesia 74,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="www.agu.org"&gt;{{cite web | title = Human Activities Emit Way More Carbon Dioxide Than Do Volcanoes |url=http://www.agu.org/news/press/pr_archives/2011/2011-22.shtml |publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]] |date=14 June 2011 |access-date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere, which itself is part of the climate system, the IPCC explicitly defines volcanism as an external forcing agent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexes.html Annexes],{{page needed|date=October 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plate tectonics====
{{Main|Plate tectonics}}
Over the course of millions of years, the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography. This can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| year =1999| title = Paleoaltimetry incorporating atmospheric physics and botanical estimates of paleoclimate| journal = Geological Society of America Bulletin| volume = 111| pages = 497–511| issue = 4 | doi = 10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111&lt;0497:PIAPAB&gt;2.3.CO;2| first4 = K.A.| last2 = Wolfe | first1 = C.E.| last3 = Molnar | first2 = J.A.| first3 = P.| last4 = Emanuel| last1 = Forest|bibcode = 1999GSAB..111..497F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation. The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe, and therefore, in determining global climate. A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] about 5 million years ago, which shut off direct mixing between the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] Oceans. This strongly affected the [[western boundary current|ocean dynamics]] of what is now the [[Gulf Stream]] and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16401 |title=Panama: Isthmus that Changed the World |accessdate=1 July 2008 |publisher=[[NASA]] Earth Observatory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802015424/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16401 |archivedate=2 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2508|title=How the Isthmus of Panama Put Ice in the Arctic|first=Gerald H.|last=Haug |first2=Lloyd D. |last2=Keigwin |date=22 March 2004|journal=Oceanus |volume=42 |issue=2 |publisher=[[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Carboniferous]] period, about 300 to 360 million years ago, plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and increased [[wikt:glaciation|glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Isotope stratigraphy of the European Carboniferous: proxy signals for ocean chemistry, climate and tectonics|date=1999-09-30|volume=161|issue=1–3|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(99)00084-4|pages=127–63|first=Peter |last=Bruckschen|first2=Susanne |last2=Oesmanna|first3=Ján |last3=Veizer |ref=harv |journal=Chemical Geology|bibcode=1999ChGeo.161..127B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geologic evidence points to a "megamonsoonal" circulation pattern during the time of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]], and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Judith T. |last=Parrish|title=Climate of the Supercontinent Pangea|journal=Chemical Geology|year=1993|volume=101|pages=215–33 |doi=10.1086/648217|issue=2|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|jstor=30081148|ref=harv|bibcode = 1993JG....101..215P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of continents is also important. Because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature, yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland. A larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or [[island]]s.

==== Other mechanisms ====
The Earth receives an influx of [[ion]]ized particles known as [[cosmic rays]] from a variety of external sources, including the Sun. A hypothesis holds that an increase in the cosmic ray flux would increase the ionization in the atmosphere, leading to greater cloud cover. This, in turn, would tend to cool the surface. The non-solar cosmic ray flux may vary as a result of a [[Near-Earth supernova|nearby supernova]] event, the [[solar system]] passing through a dense [[interstellar cloud]], or the oscillatory movement of the Sun's position with respect to the [[galactic plane]]. The latter can increase the flux of high-energy cosmic rays coming from the [[Virgo cluster]].&lt;ref name=Atri2014&gt;{{cite journal

Evidence exists that the [[Chicxulub impact]] some 66 million years ago had severely affected the Earth's climate. Large quantities of sulfate aerosols were kicked up into the atmosphere, decreasing global temperatures by up to 26&amp;nbsp;°C and producing sub-freezing temperatures for a period of 3−16 years. The recovery time for this event took more than 30 years.&lt;ref name=Brugger2017&gt;{{citation

Evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources that can be used to reconstruct past climates. Reasonably complete global records of surface temperature are available beginning from the mid-late 19th century. For earlier periods, most of the evidence is indirect—climatic changes are inferred from changes in [[Proxy (climate)|proxies]], indicators that reflect climate, such as [[vegetation]], [[ice core]]s,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petit | first1 = J.R. | title = Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 399 | pages = 429–46 | date = 1999-06-03 | doi = 10.1038/20859 | issue = 1 | first2 = J. |last2=Jouzel | first3 = D. |last3=Raynaud | first4 = N.I. |last4=Barkov | first5 = J.-M. |last5=Barnola | first6 = I. |last6=Basile | first7 = M. |last7=Bender | first8 = J. |last8=Chappellaz | first9 = M. |last9=Davis | first10 = G. |last10=Delaygue | first11 = M. |last11=Delmotte | first12 = V.M. |last12=Kotlyakov | first13 = M. |last13=Legrand | first14 = V.Y. |last14=Lipenkov | first15 = C. |last15=Lorius | first16 = C. |last16=Ritz | first17 = E. |last17=Saltzman | ref = harv | bibcode=1999Natur.399..429P}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dendrochronology]], [[sea level change]], and [[glacial geology]].

===Temperature (surface and oceans)===
The [[instrumental temperature record]] from surface stations was supplemented by [[radiosonde|radiosonde balloons]], extensive atmospheric monitoring by the mid-20th century, and, from the 1970s on, with [[Satellite temperature measurements|global satellite data]] as well. Taking the record as a whole, most of the 20th century had been unprecedentedly warm, while the 19th and 17th centuries were quite cool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nexis.com/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3SKF-JCM0-00DS-B1WD&amp;csi=271028&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|title=CLIMATE WARMEST SINCE MIDDLE AGES|last=Von Radowitz|first=John|date=April 23, 1998|website=Century Newspapers LTD|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O ratio in calcite and ice core samples [[Oxygen isotope ratio cycle|used to deduce ocean temperature in the distant past]] is an example of a temperature proxy method, as are other climate metrics noted in subsequent categories.

===Glaciers===
[[Glacier]]s are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change.&lt;ref name="Seiz2007"&gt;{{cite report|last=Seiz |first=G. |author2=N. Foppa |title=The activities of the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) |year=2007 |url=http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/web/en/climate/climate_international/gcos/inventory/wgms.Par.0008.DownloadFile.tmp/gcosreportwgmse.pdf |accessdate=21 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325100331/http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/web/en/climate/climate_international/gcos/inventory/wgms.Par.0008.DownloadFile.tmp/gcosreportwgmse.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their size is determined by a [[mass balance]] between snow input and melt output. As temperatures warm, glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt; the converse is also true.

Glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings. Variability in temperature, precipitation, and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season. Therefore, one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and/or over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate.

A world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s, initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellites. This compilation tracks more than 100,000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around 445,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The World Glacier Monitoring Service collects data annually on [[retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]] and [[glacier mass balance]]. From this data, glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly, with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s, stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s, and again retreating from the mid-1980s to the present.&lt;ref name="Zemp2008"&gt;{{cite report| last = Zemp | first = M. |author2=I.Roer |author3=A.Kääb |author4=M.Hoelzle |author5=F.Paul |author6=W.

The most significant climate processes since the middle to late [[Pliocene]] (approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and [[interglacial]] cycles. The present interglacial period (the [[Holocene]]) has lasted about 11,700 years.&lt;ref name="ICS2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/column.php?id=Chart/Time%20Scale|title=International Stratigraphic Chart|year=2008|publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy|accessdate=3 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015042711/http://www.stratigraphy.org/column.php?id=Chart%2FTime%20Scale|archivedate=15 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaped by [[Milankovitch cycles|orbital variations]], responses such as the rise and fall of [[Continental climate|continental]] ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate. Other changes, including [[Heinrich event]]s, [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event]]s and the [[Younger Dryas]], however, illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the [[orbital forcing]].

Glaciers leave behind [[moraine]]s that contain a wealth of material—including organic matter, quartz, and potassium that may be dated—recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated. Similarly, by [[tephrochronology|tephrochronological]] techniques, the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of soil or volcanic [[tephra]] horizons whose date of deposit may also be ascertained.

Data from [[NASA]]'s Grace satellites show that the land ice sheets in both [[Antarctica]] (upper chart) and [[Greenland]] (lower) have been losing mass since 2002. Both ice sheets have seen an acceleration of ice mass loss since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/|title=Land ice - NASA Global Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arctic sea ice decline===
{{Main|Arctic sea ice decline|Climate change in the Arctic}}
The decline in Arctic sea ice, both in extent and thickness, over the last several decades is further evidence for rapid climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ | accessdate=2017-12-16 | publisher=Earth Science Communications Team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory | website=NASA Global Climate Change | title=Climate Change: How do we know? | editor1-first=Holly | editor1-last=Shaftel }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface. It covers millions of square kilometers in the polar regions, varying with the seasons. In the [[Arctic]], some sea ice remains year after year, whereas almost all [[Southern Ocean]] or Antarctic sea ice melts away and reforms annually. Satellite observations show that Arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.2 percent per decade, relative to the 1981 to 2010 average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | editor1-first=Holly | editor1-last=Shaftel |title=Arctic Sea Ice Minimum|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/|website=NASA Global Climate Change|publisher=Earth Science Communications Team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 Arctic summer sea ice retreat was unprecedented.

[[File:Projected change in global sea level rise if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were to either quadruple or double (NOAA GFDL).png|thumb|The estimated change in sea level caused by carbon dioxide emissions.]]
Global sea level change for much of the last century has generally been estimated using [[tide gauge]] measurements collated over long periods of time to give a long-term average. More recently, [[altimeter]] measurements—in combination with accurately determined [[satellite]] orbits—have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sealevel.colorado.edu/documents.php|title=Sea Level Change|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements, scientists have dated [[coral reef]]s that grow near the surface of the ocean, coastal sediments, [[marine terrace]]s, [[ooids]] in [[limestone]]s, and nearshore archaeological remains. The predominant dating methods used are [[Uranium-thorium dating|uranium series]] and [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]], with [[cosmogenic radionuclide dating|cosmogenic radionuclides]] being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level fall.

===Ice cores===
[[File:Five Myr Climate Change.svg|thumb|The Antarctic temperature changes during the last several [[Glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial]] cycles of the present [[ice age]], according to [[δ18O]] ratios.]]
Analysis of ice in a core drilled from an [[ice sheet]] such as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], can be used to show a link between temperature and global sea level variations. The air trapped in bubbles in the ice can also reveal the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; variations of the atmosphere from the distant past, well before modern environmental influences. The study of these ice cores has been a significant indicator of the changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over many millennia, and continues to provide valuable information about the differences between ancient and modern atmospheric conditions.

===Cloud cover and precipitation===

For instance, during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] of 18,000 years ago, thermal-driven [[evaporation]] from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low, causing large areas of extreme desert, including [[polar desert]]s (cold but with low rates of cloud cover and precipitation).&lt;ref name = ORNL_paleoclimate/&gt; In contrast, the world's climate was cloudier and wetter than today near the start of the warm [[Atlantic period|Atlantic Period]] of 8000 years ago.&lt;ref name = ORNL_paleoclimate/&gt;

Estimated global land precipitation increased by approximately 2% over the course of the 20th century, though the calculated trend varies if different time endpoints are chosen, complicated by [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|ENSO]] and other oscillations, including greater global land cloud cover precipitation in the 1950s and 1970s than the later 1980s and 1990s despite the positive trend over the century overall.&lt;ref name = IJC_precip/&gt;&lt;ref name = USGS_watercycletrend&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huntington, T.G.

Similar slight overall increase in global river runoff and in average soil moisture has been perceived.&lt;ref name = USGS_watercycletrend/&gt;

===Vegetation===
A change in the type, distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climate. Some changes in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth, resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and fruiting times, driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent organisms. Conversely, cold will cause plant bio-cycles to lag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kinver |first=Mark |date=2011-11-15 |title=UK trees' fruit ripening '18 days earlier' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15721263 |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger, faster or more radical changes, however, may result in vegetation stress, rapid plant loss and [[desertification]] in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.J. |last3=Falcon-Lang |first3=H.J. |year=2010 |title=Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica |journal=Geology |doi=10.1130/G31182.1 |bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=1079–82 |ref=harv |url=https://www.academia.edu/368820/Rainforest_collapse_triggered_Pennsylvanian_tetrapod_diversification_in_Euramerica |format=PDF |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bachelet |first1=D. |last2=Neilson |first2=R. |last3=Lenihan |first3=J.

====Forest genetic resources====
Even though this is a field with many uncertainties, it is expected that over the next 50 years climate changes will have an effect on the diversity of [[forest genetic resources]] and thereby on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests. Diversity of [[forest genetic resources]] enables the potential for a species (or a population) to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes, drought, pests, diseases and forest fire. However, species are not naturally capable to adapt in the pace of which the climate is changing and the increasing temperatures will most likely facilitate the spread of pests and diseases, creating an additional threat to forest trees and their populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konert, M.; Fady, B.; Gömöry, D.; A'Hara, S.; Wolter, F; Ducci, F.; Koskela, J.; Bozzano,M.; Maaten, T. &amp; Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and Transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=European Forest Genetic Resources Programme|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; To inhibit these problems human interventions, such as transfer of [[forest reproductive material]], may be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koskela, J.; Buck, A.; Teissier du Cros, E.|title=Climate change and forest genetic diversity – Implications for sustainable forest management in Europe|journal=European Forest Genetic Resources Programme|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FGR_and_Climate_change_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pollen analysis====
[[Palynology]] is the study of contemporary and fossil [[palynomorph]]s, including [[pollen]]. Palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species, which vary under different climate conditions. Different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures, and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material, they resist decay. Changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment in lakes, bogs, or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities. These changes are often a sign of a changing climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Langdon |first1=P.G. |last2=Barber |first2=K.E. |last3=Lomas-Clarke |first3=S.H. |last4=Lomas-Clarke |first4=S.H. |date=August 2004 |title=Reconstructing climate and environmental change in northern England through chironomid and pollen analyses: evidence from Talkin Tarn, Cumbria |journal=Journal of Paleolimnology |doi=10.1023/B:JOPL.0000029433.85764.a5 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=197–213 | ref = harv|bibcode=2004JPall..32..197L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Birks | first = H.H. | title = The importance of plant macrofossils in the reconstruction of Lateglacial vegetation and climate: examples from Scotland, western Norway, and Minnesota, US | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 22 | issue = 5–7 | pages = 453–73 |date=March 2003 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-3791(02)00248-2|bibcode = 2003QSRv...22..453B | ref = harv | url = https://bora.uib.no/bitstream/1956/387/4/1956-387.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, palynological studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns throughout the [[Quaternary glaciation]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miyoshi |first1=N |title=Palynology of a 250-m core from Lake Biwa: a 430,000-year record of glacial–interglacial vegetation change in Japan |journal=Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology |volume=104 |pages=267–83 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0034-6667(98)00058-X |issue=3–4 |last2=Fujiki |first2=Toshiyuki |last3=Morita |first3=Yoshimune |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially since the [[last glacial maximum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=I.

===Animals===
Remains of [[beetle]]s are common in freshwater and land sediments. Different species of beetles tend to be found under different climatic conditions. Given the extensive lineage of beetles whose genetic makeup has not altered significantly over the millennia, knowledge of the present climatic range of the different species, and the age of the sediments in which remains are found, past climatic conditions may be inferred.&lt;ref name=Coope1999&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coope | first = G.R. | title = Temperature gradients in northern Europe during the last glacial – Holocene transition (14–9 14 C kyr BP) interpreted from coleopteran assemblages | journal = [[Journal of Quaternary Science]] | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 419–33 | date = 1999-05-04 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1417(1998090)13:5&lt;419::AID-JQS410&gt;3.0.CO;2-D | author2 = Lemdahl, G.; Lowe, J.J.; Walkling, A.|bibcode = 1998JQS....13..419C | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The studies of the impact in vertebrates are few mainly from [[Developing country|developing countries]], where there are the fewest studies; between 1970 and 2012, vertebrates declined by 58 percent, with freshwater, marine, and terrestrial populations declining by 81, 36, and 35 percent, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, W.J., Wolf C., Newsome T.

=== Human disease vectors ===
Climate change has already led to the alteration in geographical distribution of various human disease vectors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=James N.|last2=Gage|first2=Kenneth L.|last3=Khan|first3=Ali S.|date=November 2010|title=Potential Influence of Climate Change on Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases: A Review and Proposed Research Plan|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2974686/|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=118|issue=11|pages=1507–1514|doi=10.1289/ehp.0901389|issn=0091-6765|pmc=2974686|pmid=20576580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sutherst|first=Robert W.|date=January 2004|title=Global Change and Human Vulnerability to Vector-Borne Diseases|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC321469/|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=17|issue=1|pages=136–173|doi=10.1128/CMR.17.1.136-173.2004|issn=0893-8512|pmid=14726459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both migration to cooler climates and higher elevations has been observed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It has been suggested that these migration events could in some cases lead to greater disease transmission.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell-Lendrum|first=Diarmid|last2=Manga|first2=Lucien|last3=Bagayoko|first3=Magaran|last4=Sommerfeld|first4=Johannes|date=2015-04-05|title=Climate change and vector-borne diseases: what are the implications for public health research and policy?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342958/|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=370|issue=1665|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0552|issn=0962-8436|pmc=4342958|pmid=25688013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, extinction events may also be expected which could possibly decrease the number of vectors in a given area.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Temperature alone can have an effect on vector biting rates, reproductive cycles, and survival rates.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It has been suggested that an increase in global temperature may lessen the potential for seasonally lower temperatures which cyclically decrease vector populations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Humidity and rainfall also have an effect on vector population dynamics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Temperature also affects the survival of the pathogens carried by vectors.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

There is significant variability in how various vector borne diseases are impacted by climate change.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Climate change has had a mixed effect on Malaria in Africa.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Drought in some areas has led to decreased malaria transmission risk, whilst other areas have become more suitable to transmission through increased rainfall.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many confounding variables also make the association between climate change and malaria transmission in Africa difficult to assess.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Improved infrastructure and socioeconomic factors along with basic healthcare and preventive care can decrease the risk of transmission and mortality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Paul|date=2001|title=Climate Change and Mosquito-Borne Disease|url=|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=109|pages=141–161|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of effective healthcare interventions and other protective factors make Dengue fever more prone to the effects of climate change than malaria.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Similarly to malaria, an increase in precipitation and temperature has led to a higher population density of the mosquitoes responsible for Dengue fever and an increase in transmission rates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; But, in contrast with malaria, urbanization appears to be positively associated with transmission of the virus.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It has therefore been suggested that efforts to control the spread of Dengue in the wake of climate change may be less effective than those directed towards malaria.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Changes in human and animal migration patterns due to climate change have caused an increased in prevalence of vector borne diseases.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, drought and higher temperatures have led to human migration to water sources, where fly vectors for Leishmaniasis preside.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Thus, behavioral alterations due to climate change can cause an increase in prevalence of vector borne diseases. Climate change can also affect migration patterns of vectors, such as those that carry hemorrhagic fever viruses.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Increasing temperatures at higher altitudes have led to migration of new species into these areas which can carry vector borne diseases.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Human Health Outcomes ===
Climate change has been shown to cause changes to weather patterns, affecting temperature, wind patterns, precipitation, etc. These changes in weather affect human health outcomes by increasing the rate of major natural disasters, physical trauma, and infections, especially impacting vulnerable, lower income communities &lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haines|first=A.|last2=Kovats|first2=R.S.|last3=Campbell-Lendrum|first3=D.|last4=Corvalan|first4=C.|date=July 2006|title=Climate change and human health: Impacts, vulnerability and public health|url=https://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506(06)00005-9/fulltext|journal=Public Health|language=English|volume=120|issue=7|pages=585–596|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2006.01.002|issn=0033-3506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Paul R.|date=2005-10-06|title=Climate Change and Human Health|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp058079?casa_token=8uzTycX7GxgAAAAA:i30Mz8kVWF23EyJPyngOrPOMd3xY4NaLs6ISonUscNxt_N_YpGgzEmomKUowRr2GfHTkDaSn-_UOfg|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=353|issue=14|pages=1433–1436|doi=10.1056/nejmp058079|issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, climate change has already caused 150,000 deaths and lost 5.5 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs), a measure of years of life affected by disability rather than death &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. It has been estimated that by 2020, an increase in the number of climate change related deaths would be seen due to heat wave induced cardiovascular disease, floods, and vector borne diseases, like malaria&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. By 2030, it is estimated that adverse health outcomes would double due to climate change &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patz|first=Jonathan A.|last2=Campbell-Lendrum|first2=Diarmid|last3=Holloway|first3=Tracey|last4=Foley|first4=Jonathan A.|date=November 2005|title=Impact of regional climate change on human health|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04188/|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=438|issue=7066|pages=310–317|doi=10.1038/nature04188|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Heat Waves: ====
   The rise in temperatures due to climate change, estimated to be around 1.4 to 5.88 degrees Celsius, may increase the frequency and severity of heat waves&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-03-11|title=Climate change and human health: present and future risks|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606680793|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=367|issue=9513|pages=859–869|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68079-3|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Heat waves are associated with higher mortality rates, especially in vulnerable populations &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. The elderly population are more likely to be impacted by the higher temperatures in a heatwave, often perishing from cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular causes of death&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;. Other vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised individuals, the mentally ill population, and children, have an increased mortality rate during heat waves&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. Urban islands, pockets of land in urban areas where human changes to the landscape can exacerbate the effect of increasing temperatures, are also associated with higher mortality rates during heat waves&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;. Heatwaves can also cause an increase in air pollution and humidity levels, thus increasing rates of mortality&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Despite the increase in death rates during heat waves, adaptations for higher temperatures, like increased quality of healthcare and awareness of public health, are known to decrease the effect of climate change on the number of deaths due to heat waves&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;.

==== Floods, Droughts, Storms: ====
   Climate change can cause an increase in precipitation, increasing the likelihood of rapid rising floods. These floods raise mortality rates by increasing drowning related deaths. Mortality rates also increase due to infectious diseases and exposure of toxic pollutants after these floods&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. The increase in rainfall leads to pollutants entering the water system, often contaminating drinking water with sewage, animal feces, pathogens, etc.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. Floods also lead to growth of fungal species and habituation of vectors of infectious diseases in previously unexposed areas, propagating the spread of vector borne diseases. Long term effects on human health are also known to be caused by flooding. Malnutrition and mental disorders, along with gastrointestinal and respiratory problems are known to increase after flooding&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. This most commonly occurs in less wealthy countries or areas that have more people residing in vulnerable areas and a lack of governmental aid for natural disasters and public health structures&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. It has been shown that the due increased precipitation from climate change, the number of people worldwide at risk of a flood would increase from 75 million to 200 million&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;. 

   The changing weather patterns due to climate change cause more droughts, by decreasing levels of groundwater. The lack of groundwater leads to a decrease in health of forest trees, leading to an increase risk of wildfires. Wildfires increase the risk of physical and respiratory damage to the human body. Changing weather patterns caused by climate change can also damage crops leading to malnutrition. New wind patterns can present crops with novel pathogens and decrease the number of available pollinators which usually serve a protective role. Habitats are often affected by these changes of weather. Changes in temperature and rainfall have damaged coral reefs by introducing new pathogens and inducing physical trauma by storms. The damaged reefs increase the levels of salt that are taken up by tropical fishes eaten by locals, which may lead to adverse health outcomes&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;.

==== Extreme Weather: ====
Climate change also causes more extreme weather. It is stated that climate change increases the severity of tropical storms, like Hurricane Katrina&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Winter storms may become more severe because climate change increases precipitation levels and the strength of winds. Stronger storms lead to more problems with traveling and increase chances of physical trauma&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;.

==== Infectious Diseases: ====
The transmission of infectious diseases are affected by changes in climate, by changing levels of humidity, precipitation, and temperature&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;. Warmer temperatures cause land species to inhabit previously cold areas and invade areas closer to human dwellings, increasing the risk of transmission of vector borne diseases&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. Other factors like overcrowding and poverty levels can multiply the effect of climate change on outbreaks infectious diseases&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;.

==== Air pollution: ====
Climate change also affects air pollution. Due to increased temperature caused by climate change, ozone pollutants are formed faster. Increasing levels of ozone lead to a rise in mortality rate caused by these pollutants'''.''' Changing wind patterns and levels of precipitation affect distribution of air pollutants, and may cause more wildfires that increase the risk of physical and respiratory trauma&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinney|first=Patrick L.|date=2018-02-07|title=Interactions of Climate Change, Air Pollution, and Human Health|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40572-018-0188-x|journal=Current Environmental Health Reports|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s40572-018-0188-x|issn=2196-5412}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Climate change also increases rates of asthma by increasing temperatures and changing wind patterns. These changes increase the levels and distribution of plant based irritants, like pollen and fungi. Climate change also raises levels of carbon dioxide, which affects the growth cycle of fungi, causing higher levels fungi based allergens&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;.

==History==
{{Main|History of climate change science}}

[[Historical climatology]] is the study of historical changes in climate and their effect on human history and development. The primary sources include written records such as [[sagas]], [[chronicle]]s, [[map]]s and [[local history]] literature as well as pictorial representations such as [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s and even [[rock art]]. This differs from [[paleoclimatology]] which encompasses climate change over the entire [[history of Earth]]. Notable climate events known to paleoclimatology are provided in this [[list of periods and events in climate history]].

Prior to the 18th century, scientists had not suspected that prehistoric climates were different from the modern period. By the late 18th century, geologists found evidence of a succession of [[Geologic time scale|geological ages]] with changes in climate. There were various competing theories about these changes, and [[James Hutton]], whose ideas of cyclic change over huge periods of time were later dubbed [[uniformitarianism]], was among those who found signs of past glacial activity in places too warm for [[glaciers]] in modern times.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Young |first=Davis A. |title=The biblical Flood: a case study of the Church's response to extrabiblical evidence |publisher=[[Eerdmans]] |location=Grand Rapids, Mich |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-8028-0719-4 |url=http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p82.htm |accessdate=2008-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331124027/http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/p82.htm |archivedate=31 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815 [[Jean-Pierre Perraudin]] described for the first time how glaciers might be responsible for the giant boulders seen in alpine valleys.&lt;ref name="nasa-paleo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Paleoclimatology/paleoclimatology_intro.php |title=Paleoclimatology |author=Holli Riebeek |date=28 June 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=1 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, scientific opinion had turned decisively against any belief in a human influence on climate. And whatever the regional effects, few imagined that humans could affect the climate of the planet as a whole.&lt;ref name=aiphist2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.aip.org/climate/public.htm |title=The Public and Climate Change |work=The Discovery of Global Warming | year=2011 |author=Spencer Weart}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1899 [[Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin]] developed at length the idea that changes in climate could result from changes in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=WH1965&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeiralab/Caldeira%20downloads/PSAC,%201965,%20Restoring%20the%20Quality%20of%20Our%20Environment.pdf|title=Restoring the Quality of Our Environment|year=1965|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, taking advantage of the ability of digital computers to integrate absorption curves numerically, [[Syukuro Manabe]] and Richard Wetherald made the first detailed calculation of the greenhouse effect incorporating convection (the "Manabe-Wetherald one-dimensional radiative-convective model").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.aip.org/climate/GCM.htm |title=General Circulation Models of Climate |work=The Discovery of Global Warming | year=2011 |author=Spencer Weart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Manabe S. |author2=Wetherald R.T. | year = 1967 | title = Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a Given Distribution of Relative Humidity | url = | journal = Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 241–59 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1967)024&lt;0241:teotaw&gt;2.0.co;2| bibcode=1967JAtS...24..241M}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that, in the absence of unknown feedbacks such as changes in clouds, a doubling of carbon dioxide from the current level would result in approximately 2&amp;nbsp;°C increase in global temperature.

In 1985 a joint UNEP/WMO/ICSU Conference on the "Assessment of the Role of Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases in Climate Variations and Associated Impacts" concluded that greenhouse gases "are expected" to cause significant warming in the next century and that some warming is inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.scopenvironment.org/downloadpubs/scope29/statement.html|author = World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)|year = 1986|title = Report of the International Conference on the assessment of the role of carbon dioxide and of other greenhouse gases in climate variations and associated impacts|location = Villach, Austria|accessdate = 28 June 2009|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131121040937/http://www.scopenvironment.org/downloadpubs/scope29/statement.html|archivedate = 21 November 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, scientific research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has expanded. Research during this period has been summarized in the Assessment Reports by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3473">A '''constant current''' ('''steady current''', '''time-independent current''', '''stationary current''') is a type of [[Direct Current]] (DC) that does not change its intensity with time.

== Sources ==

If the [[Electrical_load|load]] is constant, a steady current can be obtained via a constant voltage source. If the load is varying, a steady current can be obtained via a constant current supply source. 

=== Constant voltage sources ===

An [[electrochemical cell]] is a device capable of either generating [[electricity|electrical]] energy from [[electrochemistry|chemical reactions]] or facilitating chemical reactions through the introduction of electrical energy. A common example of an electrochemical cell is a standard 1.5-volt [[Battery (electricity)|cell]] meant for consumer use.  This type of device is known as a single [[Galvanic cell]], so an obsolete name for steady current was '''galvanic current'''.  A [[Battery (electricity)|''battery'']] consists of two or more cells, connected in either [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel or series]] pattern.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/electrochem.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[homopolar generator]] is an [[electrical generator]] comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating in a plane perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field. A [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]] directly extracts electric power from moving hot gases through a magnetic field, without the use of rotating electromagnetic machinery.

AC generators can be used as sources of steady current with a rectifier and a good ripple filter. Pulsed DC generators can be used as sources of steady current with a good ripple filter.

=== Constant current power supplies ===

In [[electronics]], a  constant current system is one that varies the voltage across a load to maintain a constant [[electric current]]. When a [[electrical component|component]] is indicated to be driven by a constant current, the [[driver circuit]] is, in essence, a [[current regulator]] and must appear to the component as a [[current source]] of suitable reliability. 

An important usage of constant current [[power supplies]] is with [[LED]]s. While a high [[series resistance]] is sufficient to light an LED, sometimes the design needs to guard against high current (or risk burning out the LEDs). 

Another use is in [[fluorescent lamp]]s which have very dynamic [[electrical resistance]] and are optimally operated within a short range of currents. &lt;ref&gt;Caladen Circuit Corner, before Sep 5 2009, [http://caladan.nanosoft.ca/c4/ccorner/4.php LED Current Controller] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050113203628/http://caladan.nanosoft.ca/c4/ccorner/4.php|date=2005-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other uses include [[shielded metal arc welding]] and [[gas tungsten arc welding]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6306">[[File:Copper - Chlorine Cycle.svg|thumb|Simplified diagram of the Copper–Chlorine cycle]]
The '''[[copper]]–[[chlorine]] cycle''' (Cu–Cl cycle) is a four-step [[thermochemical cycle]] for the production of hydrogen. The Cu–Cl cycle is a hybrid process that employs both [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] and electrolysis steps.
It has a maximum temperature requirement of about 530 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20080256952 Solar power for thermochemical production of hydrogen]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cu–Cl cycle involves four [[chemical reaction]]s for [[water splitting]], whose net reaction decomposes [[water]] into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]].  All other chemicals are recycled.  The Cu–Cl process can be linked with nuclear plants or other heat sources such as solar and industrial [[waste heat]] to potentially achieve higher efficiencies, lower environmental impact and lower costs of hydrogen production than any other conventional technology. 

The Cu–Cl cycle is one of the prominent thermochemical cycles under development within the [[Generation IV reactor|Generation IV International Forum]] (GIF). Through GIF, over a dozen countries around the world are developing the next generation of nuclear reactors for highly efficient production of both electricity and hydrogen.

== Process description ==

The four reactions in the Cu–Cl cycle are listed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, M.A., Naterer, G.F., Sadhankar, R., Suppiah, S., "Nuclear-Based Hydrogen Production with a Thermochemical Copper-Chlorine Cycle and Supercritical Water Reactor", Canadian Hydrogen Association Workshop, Quebec, October 19 – 20, 2006.

Approximately 50% of the heat required to drive this reaction can be captured from the reaction itself.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  The other heat can be provided by any suitable process.  Recent research has focused on a cogeneration scheme using the waste heat from nuclear reactors, specifically the [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] [[supercritical water reactor]].&lt;ref name=Naterer/&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Advantages of the copper–chlorine cycle include lower [[operating temperature]]s, the ability to use low-grade waste heat to improve energy efficiency, and potentially lower cost materials. In comparison with other thermochemical cycles, the Cu–Cl process requires relatively low temperatures of up to {{convert|530|°C|°F|-1|abbr=on}}. 

Another significant merit of this cycle is a relatively low voltage (thus low electrical energy expenditure) that is required for the electrochemical step (0.6 to 1.0 V, perhaps even 0.5 if lower current density can be achieved).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dokiya |first=M. |last2=Kotera |first2=Y. |title=Hybrid Cycle with Electrolysis Using Cu-Cl System |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=117–121 |year=1976 |url=http://hydrogen.uoit.ca/assets/Default/documents/Public/hybridCuCl.pdf |doi=10.1016/0360-3199(76)90064-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall efficiency of the Cu–Cl cycle has been estimated to be just over 43%,&lt;ref&gt;Chukwu, C., Naterer, G.

Solids handling between processes and corrosive working fluids present unique challenges for the engineering equipment development. Among others, the following materials are being currently used: [[spray coating]]s, [[nickel alloy]]s, [[glass-lined steel]], [[refractory material]]s, and other advanced materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hydrogen.uoit.ca/EN/main/research/CuCl/Materials_Corrosion.html Hydrogen Website of UOIT (University of Ontario Institute of Technology)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522035645/http://hydrogen.uoit.ca/EN/main/research/CuCl/Materials_Corrosion.html |date=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In four-dimensional geometry, the '''cubinder''' (otherwise known as '''cubical cylinder''' or '''hypercylinder''') is one way to generalise the 3D cylinder to 4D. Like the [[duocylinder]] and [[spherinder]], it is also analogous to a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] in 3-space, which is the [[Cartesian product]] of a disk with a [[line segment]].

: &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;D = \{(x,y,z,w) \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1, |z| = 1, |w| = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=cb4hBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA504&amp;lpg=PA504&amp;dq=cubinder&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wqUa_cxJus&amp;sig=rmy2IIMcIfVNa3V1x0je5R1iTQE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiig4XsmNHRAhWJOsAKHaeLA4wQ6AEIUzAO#v=onepage&amp;q=cubinder&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Frontiers of Intelligent Computing: Theory and Applications (FICTA) 2014|last=Chandra|first=Satapathy Suresh|last2=Biswal|first2=Bhabendra Narayan|last3=Udgata|first3=Siba K.|last4=Mandal|first4=J.

The Cubinder is the Cartesian Product of a circle and a square, and it is a rotachoron. It can be constructed by extrusion of a 3D [[cylinder]] along the W- axis by a unit distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agnijomaths.com/categories/geometry/Euclidean_geometry/four_dimensional_space.html|title=Four dimensional space|last=Banerjee|first=Agnijo|website=www.agnijomaths.com|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The net of a cubinder is given by a single [[cube]], surrounded by 4 cylinders.

=== Rolling ===
The square torus that binds the cubinder forms a circular surface on which the cubinder can roll. Like a circle and a cylinder, it can only roll the space of a line. The cubinder cannot roll on the 4 cylinders, as they are flat in 4D.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/cubinder|title=The Cubical Cylinder|website=eusebeia.dyndns.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cylindre cubique elements.gif|thumb|One perspective projection of the cubinder.]]

=== Projection ===
The diagram is a perspective projection of the cubinder. The cubinder is rotated 45 degrees in the ZW plane. This allows us to observe that the cubinder is made up of four cylinders. However the square torus joining the cylinders cannot be observed from this perspective. 

== Relationship to other shapes ==
In 4-space, there are three intermediate forms between the [[tesseract]] (1 ball × 1 ball × 1 ball × 1 ball) and the [[hypersphere]] (4-ball). These are as follows:
* cubinder (2-ball × 1-ball × 1-ball)
* [[spherinder]] (3-ball × 1-ball)
* [[duocylinder]] (2-ball × 2-ball).

The cubinder is also a [[rotatope]] (more specifically a '''rotachoron'''), along with other shapes such as the tesseract, duocylinder, spherinder, and [[3-sphere|glome]].  A rotachoron is a four dimensional shape which can by formed by extensions and rotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:List_of_protologisms/Q%E2%80%93Z#rotatope|title=Appendix:List of protologisms/Q–Z – Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cubinder is a rotachoron as it can be formed via extension of a cylinder or rotation of a cube.

The rotation of cubinder to 5D is non-unique: rotating it around a cubic cross-section will lead to the shape, '''spherisquare'''. However, if you rotate it around its cylindrical cross-section, you will get a different rotatope called "'''dual cylinder'''", which can be also gotten by extending the duocylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hi.gher.space/forum/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=409&amp;start=0|title=Hi.gher.

'''Diquat''' is a contact [[herbicide]] that produces [[desiccation]] and [[defoliation]] most often available as the dibromide, '''diquat dibromide'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Merck Index'', 11th Edition, '''3359'''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brand names for this formulation include Aquacide, Dextrone, Preeglone, Deiquat, Spectracide, Detrone, Reglone, Reglon, Reglox, Tribune, Ortho-Diquat, Weedtrine-D,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=6794 PubChem listing for diquat dibromide]&lt;/ref&gt; Weedol 2, and in combination with [[glyphosate]], Resolva.&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;[http://www.rhs.org.uk/media/pdfs/advice/WeedkillersForGardeners Weedkillers for Home Gardeners].

Diquat is a nonselective herbicide that acts quickly to damage only those parts of the plant to which it is applied.&lt;ref name="extoxnet"&gt;[http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/dienochlor-glyphosate/diquat-ext.html EXTOXNET], Pesticide Information Project&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in pre-harvest [[crop desiccation]].&lt;ref name=moneuro&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/glyphosate-background-materials/Agronomic%20benefits%20of%20glyphosate%20in%20Europe.pdf | title=The agronomic benefits of glyphosate in Europe | publisher=[[Monsanto]] Europe SA | date=February 2010 | accessdate=June 2, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117143642/http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/glyphosate-background-materials/Agronomic%20benefits%20of%20glyphosate%20in%20Europe.pdf | archivedate=January 17, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It bonds strongly to mineral and organic particles in soil and water, where it remains without significant degradation for years.  However, bound to clays, diquat is biologically inactive at concentrations typically observed in agricultural soils.&lt;ref name="extoxnet"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Diquat dibromide is moderately toxic. It may be fatal to humans if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin in large quantities.&lt;ref name="extoxnet"/&gt;

==Production==
[[Pyridine]] is oxidatively coupled to [[2,2'-Bipyridine|2,2′-bipyridine]] over a heated [[Raney nickel]] catalyst.

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''Directorate-General for Energy''' (DG Ener), also internally the abbreviation ENER is used, is a [[Directorate-General]] of the [[European Commission]]. The DG Ener is in operation since 17 February 2010 when it was split from the [[Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport|Transport DG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/164&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Commission creates two new Directorates-General for Energy and Climate Action|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (it had been merged with Transport since 2000).

==Mission==
DG ENER is focused on creating a competitive internal energy market to lower prices, to develop renewable energy sources, to reduce energy dependence and to reduce energy consumption.

==Resources==
The Directorate-General for Energy, based in Brussels, reports to [[Miguel Arias Cañete]], European Commissioner for Energy and Climate Action and to Vice President of the Commission [[Maroš Šefčovič]], responsible for Energy Union. The Directorate-General was headed by Phillip Lowe from March 2010 and by [[Dominique Ristori]] since January 2014.

==Structure==
The Directorate-General is made up of 6 Directorates (two of which deal with [[EURATOM]] issues), and the [[Euratom Supply Agency]].

== Electromobility == 
The Green Car Initiative (GCI)  is included in the [[European Economic Recovery Plan]] (EERP) presented November 2008. [[Electrification of transport]] ([[electromobility]])   figures prominently in  the  GCI. DG TREN is supporting a large European "electromobility" project on [[electric vehicle]]s and related infrastructure with a total budget of around € 50million as part of the Green Car Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/vehicles/road/electric_en.htm |title=Electric vehicles - Transport |work=europa.eu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033116/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/vehicles/road/electric_en.htm |archivedate=19 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy from the sun is transferred through the ecosystem by passing through various trophic levels. Roughly 10% of the energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, thus preventing a large number of trophic levels. There must be higher amounts of biomass at the bottom of the pyramid to support the energy and biomass requirements of the higher trophic levels.]]
An '''ecological pyramid''' (also '''trophic pyramid''', '''eltonian pyramid''', '''energy pyramid''', or sometimes '''food pyramid''') is a graphical representation designed to show the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] or [[Primary production|bio productivity]] at each [[trophic level]] in a given [[ecosystem]].

''Biomass pyramids'' show how much biomass (the amount of living or organic matter present in an organism) is present in the organisms at each trophic level, while ''productivity pyramids'' show the procreation or turnover in biomass. There is also ''pyramid of numbers'' which represent the number of organisms in each trophic level. They may be upright (e.g. Grassland ecosystem), inverted (parasitic ecosystem) or dumbbell shaped (forest ecosystem).

Energy pyramids begin with [[autotroph|producers]] on the bottom (such as plants) and proceed through the various trophic levels (such as herbivores that eat plants, then carnivores that eat flesh, then omnivores that eat both plants and flesh, and so on).  The highest level is the [[Apex predator|top]] of the [[food chain]].

==History==
The concept of pyramid of numbers ("Eltonian pyramid") was developed by [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] (1927).&lt;ref&gt;Elton, C. 1927. ''Animal Ecology''. New York, Macmillan Co. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/7435#/summary link].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it would also be expressed in terms of biomass by [[Shimon Fritz Bodenheimer|Bodenheimer]] (1938).&lt;ref&gt;Bodenheimer, F. S. 1938. ''Problems of Animal Ecology''. Oxford University Press. [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.218303 link].&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of pyramid of productivity or energy relies on works of [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] and [[Raymond Lindeman]] (1942).&lt;ref name="lindeman_1942"&gt;Lindeman, R. L. (1942). The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology. ''Ecology'' 23: 399–418. [http://www.fcnym.unlp.edu.ar/catedras/ecocomunidades/Lindman_1942.pdf link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trebilco, R., Baum, J.K., Salomon, A.K., Dulvy, N.K. 2013. Ecosystem ecology: size-based constraints on the pyramids of life. ''Trends Ecol. Evol.'' 28, 423–431. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267279432_Understanding_Eltonian_biomass_pyramids_with_size-based_ecological_theory#pf8 link].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyramid of numbers==
[[File:Numbers Pyramid.svg|thumb|A numbers pyramid shows the relevant number of organisms that each trophic level occupies in an ecosystem. Often, there are more producers than consumers, however, it can also be seen in many ecosystems that there are more primary consumers than producers.]]

A "pyramid of numbers" shows graphically the population of each level in a food chain. It is an upright pyramid given in an ecosystem, where usually the producers are more in number than any other [[Trophic level]]. This shows the number of organisms in each trophic level without any consideration for their size. This type of pyramid can be convenient, as counting is often a simple task and can be done over the years to observe the changes in a particular ecosystem. However, some types of organisms are difficult to count, especially when it comes to some juvenile forms. Unit: number of organisms.

==Pyramid of biomass== 
[[File:Biomass Pyramid.svg|thumb|A biomass pyramid shows the total mass of the organisms that each trophic level occupies in an ecosystem. Usually, producers have a higher biomass than any other trophic level, but there can be lower amounts of biomass at the bottom of the pyramid if the rate of primary production per unit biomass is very fast.]]

A "pyramid of biomass" shows the relationship between biomass and trophic level by quantifying the biomass present at each trophic level of an [[biocoenosis|energy community]] at a particular time. It is a graphical representation of biomass (total amount of living or organic matter in an ecosystem) present in unit area in different tropic levels. Typical units are grams per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or calories per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
The pyramid of biomass may be "inverted". For example, in a pond ecosystem, the [[standing crop]] of [[phytoplankton]], the major [[autotrophs|producers]], at any given point will be lower than the mass of the [[heterotrophs]], such as fish and insects. This is explained as the phytoplankton [[reproduce]] very quickly, but have much shorter individual lives.

One problem with biomass pyramids is that they can make a trophic level appear to contain more [[energy]] than it actually does. For example, all [[birds]] have [[beak]]s and [[skeleton]]s, which despite having [[mass]] are not typically digested by the next trophic level.

==Pyramid of Energy==
A "pyramid of productivity" is often more useful, showing the production or turnover (the rate at which energy or mass is transferred from one trophic level to the next) of biomass at each trophic level. Instead of showing a single snapshot in time, [[primary production|productivity]] pyramids show the flow of [[energy]] through the [[food chain]]. Typical units are grams per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year or calories per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year. As with the others, this graph shows producers at the bottom and higher trophic levels on top.

When an ecosystem is healthy, this graph produces a standard ''ecological pyramid''. This is because in order for the ecosystem to sustain itself, there must be more energy at lower trophic levels than there is at higher trophic levels. This allows organisms on the lower levels to not only to maintain a stable population, but also to transfer energy up the pyramid. The exception to this generalization is when portions of a [[food web]] are supported by inputs of resources from outside the local [[biocoenosis|community]]. In small, forested streams, for example, the volume of higher levels is greater than could be supported by the local [[primary production]].

When energy is transferred to the next trophic level, typically only 10% or 12% of it is used to build new biomass, becoming stored energy (the rest going to metabolic processes) (Pauly and Christensen, 1995). In this case, in the ''pyramid of productivity'' each step will be 10% the size of the previous step (100,000, 10,000, 1,000, 100, 10, 1, .1, .01).

The advantages of the ''pyramid of productivity'' as a representation:
* It takes account of the rate of production over a period of time.
* Two species of comparable biomass may have very different [[life expectancy|life spans]]. Thus a direct comparison of their total biomasses is misleading, but their productivity is directly comparable.
* The relative energy chain within an ecosystem can be compared using pyramids of energy; also different [[ecosystems]] can be compared.
* There are no inverted pyramids.
* The input of solar energy can be added.

The disadvantages of the ''pyramid of productivity'' as a representation:
* The rate of biomass production of an organism is required, which involves measuring growth and reproduction through time.
* There is still the difficulty of assigning the organisms to a specific trophic level. As well as the organisms in the [[food chain]]s there is the problem of assigning the [[decomposers]] and [[detritivore]]s to a particular trophic level.

Nonetheless, [[productivity]] pyramids usually provide more insight into an [[biocoenosis|ecological community]] when the necessary information is available.

In [[solid state physics]], a particle's '''effective mass''' (often denoted {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is the [[mass]] that it ''seems'' to have when responding to forces, or the mass that it seems to have when interacting with other identical particles in a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|thermal distribution]]. One of the results from the [[band theory]] of solids is that the movement of particles in a periodic potential, over long distances larger than the lattice spacing, can be very different from their motion in a vacuum.
The effective mass is a quantity that is used to simplify band structures by modeling the behavior of a free particle with that mass.
For some purposes and some materials, the effective mass can be considered to be a simple constant of a material. In general, however, the value of effective mass depends on the purpose for which it is used, and can vary depending on a number of factors.

For [[electron]]s or [[electron hole]]s in a solid, the effective mass is usually stated in units of the [[electron rest mass|rest mass of an electron]], ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' (9.11×10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt; kg). In these units it is usually in the range 0.01 to 10, but can also be lower or higher—for example, reaching 1,000 in exotic [[heavy fermion]] materials, or anywhere from zero to infinity&lt;!-- Note to editors: Yes, graphene really does have infinite effective mass by some definitions. Please read the article before changing this, and understand that relativistic rest mass is not the same thing as effective mass. --&gt; (depending on definition) in [[graphene]]. As it simplifies the more general band theory, the electronic effective mass can be seen as an important basic parameter that influences measurable properties of a solid, including everything from the efficiency of a solar cell to the speed of an integrated circuit.

==Simple case: parabolic, isotropic dispersion relation==

At the highest energies of the valence band in many semiconductors (Ge, Si, GaAs, ...), and the lowest energies of the conduction band in some semiconductors (GaAs, ...), the band structure {{math|''E''('''k''')}} can be locally approximated as
:&lt;math&gt;E(\mathbf k) = E_0 + \frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf k^2}{2 m^*}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''('''k''')}} is the energy of an electron at [[wavevector]] {{math|'''k'''}} in that band, {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a constant giving the edge of energy of that band, and {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a constant (the effective mass).

It can be shown that the electrons placed in these bands behave as free electrons except with a different mass, as long as their energy stays within the range of validity of the approximation above. As a result, the electron mass in models such as the [[Drude model]] must be replaced with the effective mass.

One remarkable property is that the effective mass can become ''negative'', when the band curves downwards away from a maximum. As a result of the [[negative mass]], the electrons respond to electric and magnetic forces by gaining velocity in the opposite direction compared to normal; even though these electrons have negative charge, they move in trajectories as if they had positive charge (and positive mass). This explains the existence of [[electron hole|valence-band holes]], the positive-charge, positive-mass [[quasiparticle]]s that can be found in semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;Kittel, ''Introduction to Solid State Physics'' 8th edition, page 194-196&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, if the band structure has the simple parabolic form described above, then the value of effective mass is unambiguous. Unfortunately, this parabolic form is not valid for describing most materials. In such complex materials there is no single definition of "effective mass" but instead multiple definitions, each suited to a particular purpose. The rest of the article describes these effective masses in detail.

==Intermediate case: parabolic, anisotropic dispersion relation==

[[Image:Silicon conduction band ellipsoids.JPG|thumb|Constant energy ellipsoids in silicon near the six conduction band minima. For each valley (band minimum), the effective masses are ''m&lt;sub&gt;ℓ&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.92''m''{{sub|''e''}} ("longitudinal"; along one axis) and ''m&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.19''m''{{sub|''e''}} ("transverse"; along two axes).&lt;ref name =Kittel1&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Kittel |title=op. cit |page=216 |isbn=978-0-471-11181-8|year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In some important semiconductors (notably, silicon) the lowest energies of the conduction band are not symmetrical, as the constant-energy surfaces are now [[ellipsoid]]s, rather than the spheres in the isotropic case. Each conduction band minimum can be approximated only by
:&lt;math&gt;E\left(\mathbf{k}\right) =
  E_0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_x^*}\left(k_x - k_{0,x}\right)^2 + \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_y^*}\left(k_y - k_{0,y}\right)^2 + \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_z^*}\left(k_z - k_{0,z}\right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes are aligned to the principal axes of the ellipsoids, and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the inertial effective masses along these different axes. The offsets {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;0,''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;0,''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;0,''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}} reflect that the conduction band minimum is no longer centered at zero wavevector. (These effective masses correspond to the principal components of the inertial effective mass tensor, described later.)

In this case, the electron motion is no longer directly comparable to a free electron; the speed of an electron will depend on its direction, and it will accelerate to a different degree depending on the direction of the force. Still, in crystals such as silicon the overall properties such as conductivity appear to be isotropic. This is because there are multiple [[valley (solid-state physics)|valley]]s (conduction-band minima), each with effective masses rearranged along different axes. The valleys collectively act together to give an isotropic conductivity. It is possible to average the different axes' effective masses together in some way, to regain the free electron picture. However, the averaging method turns out to depend on the purpose:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/effmass.htm |title=Effective mass in semiconductors |publisher=Ecee.colorado.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Drude law also depends on scattering time, which varies greatly, this effective mass is rarely used; conductivity is instead usually expressed in terms of carrier density and an empirically measured parameter, [[carrier mobility]].
}}

==General case==

In general the dispersion relation cannot be approximated as parabolic, and in such cases the effective mass should be precisely defined if it is to be used at all.
Here a commonly stated definition of effective mass is the ''inertial'' effective mass tensor defined below; however, in general it is a matrix-valued function of the wavevector, and even more complex than the band structure itself.
Other effective masses are more relevant to directly measurable phenomena.

===Inertial effective mass tensor===

A classical particle under the influence of a force accelerates according to [[Newton's second law]], {{math|'''a''' {{=}} ''m''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'''F'''}}.
This intuitive principle appears identically in semiclassical approximations derived from band structure. However, each of the symbols has a slightly modified meaning; acceleration becomes the rate of change in [[group velocity]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} =
  \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t}\,\mathbf{v}_\text{g} =
  \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t}\left(\nabla_k\,\omega\left(\mathbf{k}\right)\right) =
  \nabla_k\frac{\operatorname{d}\omega\left(\mathbf{k}\right)}{\operatorname{d}t} =
  \nabla_k\left(\frac{\operatorname{d}\mathbf{k}}{\operatorname{d}t}\cdot\nabla_k\,\omega(\mathbf{k})\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[del operator]] in [[reciprocal space]], and force gives a rate of change in [[crystal momentum]] {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;crystal&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} =
  \frac{\operatorname{d}\mathbf{p}_{\text{crystal}}}{\operatorname{d}t} =
  \hbar\frac{\operatorname{d}\mathbf{k}}{\operatorname{d}t},
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{var|ħ}} {{=}} h/2π}} is the ''[[reduced Planck constant]]''. Combining these two equations yields

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \nabla_k\left(\frac{\mathbf{F}}{\hbar}\cdot\nabla_k\,\omega(\mathbf{k})\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Extracting the {{math|{{var|i}}}}th element from both sides gives

:&lt;math&gt;a_i =
  \left(\frac{1}{\hbar}\,\frac{\partial^2 \omega\left(\mathbf{k}\right)}{\partial k_i \partial k_j}\right)\!F_j =
  \left(\frac{1}{\hbar^2}\,\frac{\partial^2 E\left(\mathbf{k}\right)}{\partial k_i \partial k_j}\right)\!F_j,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- Help needed with the tensor indices! Indices should be contravariant after a and F, but then we have only one contravariant index at the L.H.S and three contravariant indices at the R.H.S! --&gt;

where {{math|{{var|a}}{{sub|{{var|i}}}}}} is the {{math|{{var|i}}}}th element of {{math|'''a'''}}, {{math|{{var|F}}{{sub|{{var|j}}}}}} is the {{math|{{var|j}}}}th element of {{math|'''F'''}}, {{math|{{var|k}}{{sub|{{var|i}}}}}} and {{math|{{var|k}}{{sub|{{var|j}}}}}} are the {{math|{{var|i}}}}th and {{math|{{var|j}}}}th elements of {{math|'''k'''}}, respectively, and {{math|''E''}} is the total energy of the particle according to the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]. The index {{math|{{var|j}}}} is contracted by the use of [[Einstein notation]] (there is an implicit summation over {{math|{{var|j}}}}). Since Newton's second law uses the [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] (not the [[gravitational mass]]), we can identify the inverse of this mass in the equation above as the tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\left[M_{\text{inert}}^{-1}\right]_{ij} = \frac{1}{\hbar^2} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial k_i \partial k_j}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This tensor expresses the change in group velocity due to a change in crystal momentum. Its inverse, {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;inert&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is known as the '''effective mass tensor'''.

The inertial expression for effective mass is commonly used, but note that its properties can be counter-intuitive:
* The effective mass tensor generally varies depending on {{math|'''k'''}}, meaning that the mass of the particle actually changes after it is subject to an impulse. The only cases in which it remains constant are those of parabolic bands, described above.
* The effective mass tensor diverges (becomes infinite) for linear dispersion relations, such as with photons or electrons in [[graphene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1206.6100|author1=Viktor Ariel|author2=Amir Natan|title=Electron Effective Mass in Graphene|class=physics.gen-ph|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (These particles are sometimes said to be massless, however this refers to their having zero [[rest mass]]; rest mass is a distinct concept from effective mass.)

===Cyclotron effective mass===

Classically, a charged particle in a magnetic field moves in a helix along the magnetic field axis. The period ''T'' of its motion depends on its mass ''m'' and charge ''e'',
:&lt;math&gt;T = \left\vert\frac{2\pi m}{e B}\right\vert&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B'' is the [[magnetic flux density]].

For particles in asymmetrical band structures, the particle no longer moves exactly in a helix, however its motion transverse to the magnetic field still moves in a closed loop (not necessarily a circle). Moreover, the time to complete one of these loops still varies inversely with magnetic field, and so it is possible to define a ''cyclotron effective mass'' from the measured period, using the above equation.

The semiclassical motion of the particle can be described by a closed loop in k-space.  Throughout this loop, the particle maintains a constant energy, as well as a constant momentum along the magnetic field axis.  By defining {{math|''A''}} to be the {{math|'''k'''-space}} area enclosed by this loop (this area depends on the energy {{math|''E''}}, the direction of the magnetic field, and the on-axis wavevector {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}}), then it can be shown that the cyclotron effective mass depends on the band structure via the derivative of this area in energy:
:&lt;math&gt;m^*\left(E, \hat{B}, k_{\hat{B}}\right) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2\pi} \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial E} A\left(E, \hat{B}, k_{\hat{B}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Typically, experiments that measure cyclotron motion ([[cyclotron resonance]], [[de Haas–van Alphen effect]], etc.) are restricted to only probe motion for energies near the [[Fermi level]].

In [[two-dimensional electron gas]]es, the cyclotron effective mass is defined only for one magnetic field direction (perpendicular) and the out-of-plane wavevector drops out. The cyclotron effective mass therefore is only a function of energy, and it turns out to be exactly related to the density of states at that energy via the relation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g(E) \;=\; \frac{g_v m^*}{\pi \hbar^2}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the valley degeneracy. Such a simple relationship does not apply in three-dimensional materials.

In semiconductors with low levels of doping, the electron concentration in the conduction band is in general given by 
:&lt;math&gt;n_e = N_C \exp\left(-\frac{E_\text{C} - E_\text{F}}{kT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Fermi level]], {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the minimum energy of the conduction band, and {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a concentration coefficient that depends on temperature.  The above relationship for {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be shown to apply for any conduction band shape (including non-parabolic, asymmetric bands), provided the doping is weak ({{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;-''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; kT}}); this is a consequence of [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] limiting towards [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]].

The concept of effective mass is useful to model the temperature dependence of {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}}, thereby allowing the above relationship to be used over a range of temperatures. In an idealized three-dimensional material with a parabolic band, the concentration coefficient is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\quad N_C = 2\left(\frac{2\pi m_e^* kT}{h^2}\right)^\frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

In semiconductors with non-simple band structures, this relationship is used to define an effective mass, known as the '''density of states effective mass of electrons'''. The name "density of states effective mass" is used since the above expression for {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}} is derived via the [[density of states]] for a parabolic band.

In practice, the effective mass extracted in this way is not quite constant in temperature ({{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not exactly vary as {{math|''T''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}). In silicon, for example, this effective mass varies by a few percent between absolute zero and room temperature because the band structure itself slightly changes in shape. These band structure distortions are a result of changes in electron-phonon interaction energies, with the lattice's thermal expansion playing a minor role.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

Similarly, the number of holes in the valence band, and the '''density of states effective mass of holes''' are defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;n_h = N_V \exp\left(-\frac{E_\text{F} - E_\text{V}}{kT}\right), \quad N_V = 2\left(\frac{2\pi m_h^* kT}{h^2}\right)^\frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the maximum energy of the valence band. Practically, this effective mass tends to vary greatly between absolute zero and room temperature in many materials (e.g., a factor of two in silicon), as there are multiple valence bands with distinct and significantly non-parabolic character, all peaking near the same energy.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

==Determination==

===Experimental===

Traditionally effective masses were measured using [[electron cyclotron resonance|cyclotron resonance]], a method in which microwave absorption of a semiconductor immersed in a magnetic field goes through a sharp peak when the microwave frequency equals the cyclotron frequency &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f_c \;=\; \frac{eB}{2\pi m^*}&lt;/math&gt;.  In recent years effective masses have more commonly been determined through measurement of [[band structure]]s using techniques such as angle-resolved [[Photoelectric effect|photo emission]] ([[Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy|ARPES]]) or, most directly, the [[de Haas–van Alphen effect]].  Effective masses can also be estimated using the coefficient γ of the linear term in the low-temperature electronic [[specific heat]] at constant volume &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c_v&lt;/math&gt;.  The specific heat depends on the effective mass through the density of states at the [[Fermi level]] and as such is a measure of degeneracy as well as band curvature.  Very large estimates of carrier mass from specific heat measurements have given rise to the concept of [[heavy fermion]] materials.  Since carrier [[electron mobility|mobility]] depends on the ratio of carrier collision lifetime &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to effective mass, masses can in principle be determined from transport measurements, but this method is not practical since carrier collision probabilities are typically not known a priori. The [[optical Hall effect]] is an emerging technique for measuring the free charge carrier density, effective mass and mobility parameters in semiconductors. The optical Hall effect measures the analogue of the quasi-static electric-field-induced electrical Hall effect at optical frequencies in conductive and complex layered materials. The optical Hall effect also permits characterization of the anisotropy (tensor character) of the effective mass and mobility parameters.&lt;ref&gt;M. Schubert, ''Infrared Ellipsometry on Semiconductor Layer Structures: Phonons, Plasmons and Polaritons'', {{ISBN|3-540-23249-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1364/JOSAA.33.001553| pmid = 27505654| title = The optical Hall effect - model description: tutorial| journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America A| volume = 33| issue = 8| pages = 1553–68| year = 2016| last1 = Schubert | first1 = M. | last2 = Kuehne | first2 = P. | last3 = Darakchieva | first3 = V. | last4 = Hofmann | first4 = T. | bibcode = 2016JOSAA..33.1553S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical===

A variety of theoretical methods including [[density functional theory]], [[k·p perturbation theory]], and [[electronic band structure#Theory of band structures in crystals|others]] are used to supplement and support the various experimental measurements described in the previous section, including interpreting, fitting, and extrapolating these measurements. Some of these theoretical methods can also be used for ''[[ab initio]]'' predictions of effective mass in the absence of any experimental data, for example to study materials that have not yet been created in the laboratory.

==Significance==
The effective mass is used in transport calculations, such as transport of electrons under the influence of fields or carrier gradients, but it also is used to calculate the carrier density and [[density of states]] in semiconductors. These masses are related but, as explained in the previous sections, are not the same because the weightings of various directions and wavevectors are different. These differences are important, for example in [[thermoelectric materials]], where high conductivity, generally associated with light mass, is desired at the same time as high [[Seebeck coefficient]], generally associated with heavy mass. Methods for assessing the electronic structures of different materials in this context have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xing|first1=G.|title=Electronic fitness function for screening semiconductors as thermoelectric materials|journal=Physical Review Materials|date=2017|volume=1|issue=6|page=065405|doi=10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.065405|arxiv=1708.04499|bibcode=2017PhRvM...1f5405X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain III-V compounds such as GaAs and InSb have far smaller effective masses than tetrahedral group IV materials like Si and Ge. In the simplest [[Drude model|Drude picture]] of electronic transport, the maximum obtainable charge carrier velocity is inversely proportional to the effective mass: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{v} \;=\; \left\Vert \mu \right\Vert \cdot \vec{E}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \left\Vert \mu \right\Vert \;=\; \frac{e \tau}{\left\Vert m^* \right\Vert}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e&lt;/math&gt; being the [[electron|electronic charge]]. The ultimate speed of [[integrated circuit]]s depends on the carrier velocity, so the low effective mass is the fundamental reason that GaAs and its derivatives are used instead of Si in high-[[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] applications like [[cellular telephony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.86.161104| title = Transformation electronics: Tailoring the effective mass of electrons| journal = Physical Review B| volume = 86| issue = 16| pages = 161104| year = 2012| last1 = Silveirinha | first1 = M.

In April 2017, researchers at Washington State University claimed to have created a fluid with negative effective mass inside a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], by engineering the [[dispersion relation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khamehchi|first1=K.A.|title=Negative-Mass Hydrodynamics in a Spin-Orbit–coupled Bose-Einstein Condensate|journal=American Physical Society|year=1553|volume=118|issue=15|pages=155301|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301|pmid=28452531|bibcode=2017PhRvL.118o5301K|arxiv=1612.04055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">'''Energy Saving Modules''' ('''ESM''') reduce the [[electricity consumption]] (kWh) and maximum demand (kW) of [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]] compressors. The concept was developed in Australia in 1983 by Abbotly Technologies and is now distributed by Smartcool Systems Inc. The system works in conjunction with existing [[HVAC]] controls ensuring that compressors work at maximum efficiency, while maintaining desired temperature levels. By preventing over-cycling, known as ‘Compressor Optimisation' consumption of electricity is cut by between 15% and 25%.

== Method of operation ==
Conventional controls, including Building and Energy Management Systems and state-of-the-art refrigeration controls, often operate only on reaching pre-programmed static values to switch compressors off and on or adjust capacity. When the measured medium is within the dead band, the system and controllers remain idle.  

The "energy saving module" is a computer that records the switching values of the primary controller and also measures the 'rate of change' of both the rise and fall of temperatures during the operating cycle. With this data the "energy saving module" computes a reference heat load to match the cooling capacity and then calculates operating parameters. This calculation is used to minimize compressor operation within the switching values, with a resultant reduction in refrigeration and air conditioning compressor run time and reduced electricity consumption. By dynamically measuring the heat load and adjusting the control differential in proportion to the cooling demand it's possible to dynamically control the cycle rate of the compressors. This is achieved while maintaining the desired[[operating temperature]].

Its main function is to catalyze the synthesis of [[palmitic acid|palmitate]] (C16:0, a long-chain [[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acid]]) from [[acetyl-CoA]] and [[malonyl-CoA]], in the presence of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]].&lt;ref name="entrez"/&gt;

== Metabolic function ==

[[Fatty acids]] are [[aliphatic]] acids fundamental to energy production and storage, cellular structure and as intermediates in the biosynthesis of [[hormone]]s and other biologically important molecules. They are synthesized by a series of decarboxylative [[Claisen condensation]] reactions from [[acetyl-CoA]] and [[malonyl-CoA]]. Following each round of elongation the beta keto group is reduced to the fully saturated carbon chain by the sequential action of a [[Beta-Ketoacyl ACP reductase|ketoreductase]] (KR), [[dehydratase]] (DH), and [[Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase|enoyl reductase]] (ER). The growing fatty acid chain is carried between these active sites while attached covalently to the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of an [[acyl carrier protein]] (ACP), and is released by the action of a [[thioesterase]] (TE) upon reaching a carbon chain length of 16 (palmitic acid).

== Classes ==

There are two principal classes of fatty acid synthases. 
* Type I systems utilise a single large, multifunctional polypeptide and are common to both [[animals]] and [[fungi]] (although the structural arrangement of fungal and animal synthases differ). A Type I fatty acid synthase system is also found in the CMN group of bacteria (corynebacteria, mycobacteria, and nocardia). In these bacteria, the FAS I system produces palmitic acid, and cooperates with the FAS II system to produce a greater diversity of lipid products.&lt;ref name="pmid15958783"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jenke-Kodama H, Sandmann A, Müller R, Dittmann E | title = Evolutionary implications of bacterial polyketide synthases | journal = Mol. Biol. Evol. | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 2027–39 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 15958783 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msi193 | url =  | issn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Type II is found in archaea and bacteria, and is characterized by the use of discrete, monofunctional enzymes for fatty acid synthesis. Inhibitors of this pathway (FASII) are being investigated as possible [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref name="Fulmer"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fulmer T | title = Not so FAS | journal = SciBX | volume = 2 | issue = 11 |date=March 2009 | url = http://www.nature.com/scibx/journal/v2/n11/full/scibx.2009.430.html | doi = 10.1038/scibx.2009.430  | pages = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism of FAS I and FAS II elongation and reduction is the same, as the domains of the FAS II enzymes are largely homologous to their domain counterparts in FAS I multienzyme polypeptides. However, the differences in the organization of the enzymes - integrated in FAS I, discrete in FAS II - gives rise to many important biochemical differences.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-850229-X"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Stevens L, Price NC | others = | title = Fundamentals of enzymology: the cell and molecular biology of catalytic proteins | edition = | language = | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 1999 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-19-850229-X | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary history of fatty acid synthases are very much intertwined with that of [[polyketide synthase]]s (PKS). Polyketide synthases use a similar mechanism and homologous domains to produce secondary metabolite lipids. Furthermore, polyketide synthases also exhibit a Type I and Type II organization. FAS I in animals is thought to have arisen through modification of PKS I in fungi, whereas FAS I in fungi and the CMN group of bacteria seem to have arisen separately through the fusion of FAS II genes.&lt;ref name="pmid15958783" /&gt;

== Structure ==

Mammalian FAS consists of a homodimer of two identical protein subunits, in which three [[catalytic]] domains in the [[N-terminal]] section (-ketoacyl synthase (KS), malonyl/acetyltransferase (MAT), and dehydrase (DH)), are separated by a core region of 600 residues from four [[C-terminal]] domains (enoyl reductase (ER), -ketoacyl reductase (KR), acyl carrier protein (ACP) and thioesterase (TE)).&lt;ref name="pmid11248039"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chirala SS, Jayakumar A, Gu ZW, Wakil SJ | title = Human fatty acid synthase: role of interdomain in the formation of catalytically active synthase dimer | journal = Proc.

The conventional model for organization of FAS (see the 'head-to-tail' model on the right) is largely based on the observations that the bifunctional reagent 1,3-dibromopropanone (DBP) is able to crosslink the active site [[cysteine]] thiol of the KS domain in one FAS monomer with the [[phosphopantetheine]] prosthetic group of the ACP domain in the other monomer.&lt;ref name="pmid6112225"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoops JK, Wakil SJ | title = Animal fatty acid synthetase.

The above observations seemed incompatible with the classical 'head-to-tail' model for FAS organization, and an alternative model has been proposed, predicting that the KS and MAT domains of both monomers lie closer to the center of the FAS dimer, where they can access the ACP of either subunit (see figure on the top right).&lt;ref name="pmid15711565"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Asturias FJ, Chadick JZ, Cheung IK, Stark H, Witkowski A, Joshi AK, Smith S | title = Structure and molecular organization of mammalian fatty acid synthase | journal = Nat.

== Substrate shuttling mechanism  ==
The solved structures of yeast FAS and mammalian FAS show two distinct organizations of highly conserved catalytic domains/enzymes in this multi-enzyme cellular machine. Yeast FAS has a highly efficient rigid barrel-like structure with 6 reaction chambers which synthesize fatty acids independently, while the mammalian FAS has an open flexible structure with only two reaction chambers. However, in both cases the conserved ACP acts as the mobile domain responsible for shuttling the intermediate fatty acid substrates to various catalytic sites. A first direct structural insight into this substrate shuttling mechanism was obtained by cryo-EM analysis, where ACP is observed bound to the various catalytic domains in the barrel-shaped yeast fatty acid synthase.&lt;ref name="GipsonMills2010"/&gt; The cryo-EM results suggest that the binding of ACP to various sites is asymmetric and stochastic, as also indicated by computer-simulation studies&lt;ref name="AnselmiGrininger2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anselmi C, Grininger M, Gipson P, Faraldo-Gómez JD | title = Mechanism of substrate shuttling by the acyl-carrier protein within the fatty acid mega-synthase | journal = J.

In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], '''flash freezing''' is a naturally occurring [[phenomenon]] used commonly in the [[food industry]] and by [[meteorology|meteorologists]] for the purpose of [[forecasting]].

The process is also of great importance in [[atmospheric science]], as its study is necessary for a proper [[climate model]] for the formation of [[ice cloud]]s in the upper [[troposphere]], which effectively scatter incoming [[solar radiation]] and prevent Earth from becoming overheated by the [[sun]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130521152429.htm|title=Better understanding of water's freezing behavior at nanoscale |website=sciencedaily.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flash freezing is closely related to classical [[nucleation]] theory, which helps us understand many materials, phenomena and theories in related situations.

== Introduction ==
[[File:Feathery Snow Crystals (2217830221).jpg|alt=Snow crystals|thumb|Snow crystals|244px]]
'''Flash freezing''' refers to the process whereby objects are frozen in just a few hours&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-flash-freezing.htm&lt;/ref&gt; by subjecting them to [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] temperatures, or through direct contact with [[liquid nitrogen]] at {{Convert|-196|C|}}.

When water is supercooled to temperatures below {{Conv|-48|C|}}, it must freeze.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111123133123.htm|title=Supercool: Water doesn't have to freeze until -48 C (-55 F) |website=sciencedaily.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freezing water is a central issue for climate, geology and life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160621115439.htm|title=How water droplets freeze: The physics of ice and snow |website=sciencedaily.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On earth, ice and snow cover 10% of the land and up to 50% of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] in winter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Polar ice caps]] reflect up to 90% of the sun’s incoming radiation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The science of freezing water depends on multiple factors, including how water droplets freeze, how much water is in the atmosphere, if water is in a liquid or crystal state, at what temperature it freezes, and whether it crystallizes from within or from the surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The freezing of [[nanoscale]] water or [[silicon]] liquid drops is initiated at a number of different distances from the centre of the droplet, providing new insights on a long-standing dispute in the field of [[Materials physics|material]] and [[chemical physics]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When water is in a [[Freezer|conventional freezer]], a dynamic [[phase transition]] is triggered.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150318101355.htm|title=Superradiant matter: A new paradigm to explore dynamic phase transitions |website=sciencedaily.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting ice depends on how quickly the system is cooled: If the water is cooled below its freezing point slowly, an ice crystal will result, rather than the poly-crystalline solid that flash freezing results in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications and techniques ==
Flash freezing is used in the [[food industry]] to quickly freeze [[perishable food]] items (see [[frozen food]]). In this case, food items are subjected to temperatures well below water's [[melting point|melting/freezing point]].{{clarify|What temperature? All freezers work well below freezing point|date=February 2017}} Thus, smaller ice crystals are formed, causing less damage to [[cell membranes]].&lt;ref&gt;Da-Wen Sun (2001), Advances in food refrigeration, Yen-Con Hung, Cryogenic Refrigeration, p.318, Leatherhead Food Research Association Publishing,   http://www.worldcat.org/title/advances-in-food-refrigeration/oclc/48154735&lt;/ref&gt;

Flash freezing techniques are used to freeze biological samples quickly so that large ice crystals cannot form and damage the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biotech.ufl.edu/EM/data/freeze.html|title=Freezing Tissue|date=|publisher=Biotech.ufl.edu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111233417/http://www.biotech.ufl.edu/EM/data/freeze.html|archivedate=11 January 2012|accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rapid freezing is done by submerging the sample in [[liquid nitrogen]] or a mixture of [[dry ice]] and [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/dsg11/labmanual/DNA_manipulations/Comp_bact_by_RF1_RF2.htm|title=Preparing Competent E. coli with RF1/RF2 solutions|date=|publisher=Personal.psu.edu|accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[inventor]] [[Clarence Birdseye]] developed the "quick-freezing" process of [[food preservation]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UigDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=1930+plane+%22Popular&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bfiPTs-NGInE0AHC_4k_&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=1930%20plane%20%22Popular&amp;f=true "Quick-Frozen Food Exactly Like Fresh."] ''Popular Science Monthly'', September 1930, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  This process was further developed by American inventor [[Daniel Tippmann]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/patents/US20110107784&lt;/ref&gt; by producing a vacuum and drawing the cold air through [[palletized]] food.

The results have important implications in [[climate control]] research. One of the current debates is whether the formation of ice occurs near the surface or within the [[micrometre]]-sized droplets suspended in clouds. If it is the former, effective [[engineering]] approaches may be able to be taken to tune the [[Surface tension|surface tension of water]] so that the ice crystallization rate can be controlled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== How water freezes ==
There are phenomena like supercooling, in which the water is cooled below its freezing point, but the water remains liquid, if there are too few defects to seed crystallization. One can therefore observe a delay until the water adjusts to the new, below-freezing temperature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Supercooled liquid water must become ice at minus 48 C (minus 55 F) not just because of the extreme cold, but because the molecular structure of water changes physically to form tetrahedron shapes, with each water molecule loosely bonded to four others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This suggests the structural change from liquid to "intermediate ice".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The crystallization of ice from supercooled water is generally initiated by a process called nucleation. Because of the speed and size of nucleation, which occurs within nanoseconds and nanometers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The surface environment does not play a decisive role in the formation of ice and snow.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121005092911.htm|title=Freezing water droplets form sharp ice peaks |website=sciencedaily.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density fluctuations inside drops result in that the possible freezing regions cover the middle and the surface regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The freezing from the surface or from within may be random.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in the strange world of water, tiny amounts of liquid water theoretically still are present, even as temperatures go below minus 48 C (minus 55 F) and almost all the water has turned solid, either into crystalline ice or amorphous water. Below minus 48 C (minus 55 F), ice is crystallizing too fast for any property of the remaining liquid to be measured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The freezing speed directly influences the [[crystal growth#Nucleation|nucleation]] process and ice crystal size. A [[supercooled liquid]] will stay in a liquid state below the normal freezing point when it has little opportunity for [[nucleation]]; that is, if it is pure enough and has a smooth enough container. Once agitated it will rapidly become a solid.
During the final stage of freezing, an ice drop develops a pointy tip, which is not observed for most other liquids, arises because water expands as it freezes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once the liquid is completely frozen, the sharp tip of the drop attracts water vapor in the air, much like a sharp metal lightning rod attracts electrical charges.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The water vapor collects on the tip and a tree of small ice crystals starts to grow.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An opposite effect has been shown to preferentially extract water molecules from the sharp edge of potato wedges in the oven.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

If a microscopic droplet of water is cooled very fast, it forms what is called a glass (low-density amorphous ice) in which all the tetrahedrons of water molecules are not lined up, but amorphous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The change in structure of water controls the rate at which ice forms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Depending on its temperature and pressure, water ice has 16 different crystalline forms in which water molecules cling to each other with hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When water is cooled down, its structure becomes closer to the structure of ice, which is why the density goes down, and this should be reflected in an increased crystallization rate showing these crystalline forms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Related quantities ==
For the understanding of flash freezing, various related quantities might be useful.

Crystal growth or nucleation is the formation of a new thermodynamic phase or a new structure via self-assembly. Nucleation is often found to be very sensitive to impurities in the system. For nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase, such as the formation of ice in water below 0&amp;nbsp;°C, if the system is not evolving with time and nucleation occurs in one step, then the probability that nucleation has not occurred should undergo exponential decay. This can also be observed in the nucleation of ice in supercooled small water droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laboratory evidence for volume-dominated nucleation of ice in supercooled water microdroplets|last=Duft|first=D|publisher=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decay rate of the exponential gives the nucleation rate and is given by

&lt;math&gt;R\ =\ N_S Zj\exp \left( \frac{-\Delta G^*}{k_BT} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where 
* &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \Delta G^{*}} &lt;/math&gt; is the free energy cost of the nucleus at the top of the nucleation barrier, and kBT is the thermal energy with T the absolute temperature and kB is the Boltzmann constant.
* &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle N_{S}}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nucleation sites.
* &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle j}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which molecules attach to the nucleus causing it to grow.
* &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle Z}&lt;/math&gt; is what is called the Zeldovich factor Z. Essentially the Zeldovich factor is the probability that a nucleus at the top of the barrier will go on to form the new phase, not dissolve.
[[File:Hethomnucdifference.JPG|thumb|Difference in energy barriers|255x255px]]
Classical nucleation theory is a widely used approximate theory for estimating these rates, and how they vary with variables such as temperature. It correctly predicts that the time needed for nucleation decreases extremely rapidly when supersaturated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microphysics of Clouds and Precipitation|last=Pruppacher. Klett|first=H.R., J.D.|publisher=Kluwer|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nucleation: theory and applications to protein solutions and colloidal suspensions|last=Sear|first=R.P.|publisher=Physics Cond. Matt.|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nucleation can be divided into homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation. First comes homogeneous nucleation, because this is much simpler. Classical nucleation theory assumes that for a microscopic nucleus of a new phase, the free energy of a droplet can be written as the sum of a bulk term, proportional to a volume and surface term.

&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \Delta G={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}\Delta g+4\pi r^{2}\sigma } &lt;/math&gt;

The first term is the volume term, and, assuming that the nucleus is spherical, this is the volume of a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle r}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \Delta g}&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in free energy per unit volume between the thermodynamic phase nucleation is occurring in, and the phase that is nucleating.

critical nucleus radius, at some intermediate value of  &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle r}&lt;/math&gt;, the free energy goes through a maximum, and so the probability of formation of a nucleus goes through a minimum. There is a least-probable nucleus occurs, i.e., the one with the highest value of &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \Delta G} &lt;/math&gt; where

&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle {\frac {dG}{dr}}=0}&lt;/math&gt;

This is called the critical nucleus and occurs at a critical nucleus radius

&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle r^{*}=-{\frac {2\sigma }{\Delta g}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Addition of new molecules to nuclei larger than this critical radius decreases the free energy, so these nuclei are more probable.

Heterogeneous nucleation, nucleation with the nucleus at a surface, is much more common than homogeneous nucleation. Heterogeneous nucleation is typically much faster than homogeneous nucleation because the nucleation barrier  &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \Delta G^{*}} &lt;/math&gt;  is much lower at a surface. This is because the nucleation barrier comes from the positive term in the free energy &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \Delta G} &lt;/math&gt;, which is the surface term. Thus, in conclusion, the nucleation probability is highest at a surface instead of the centre of a liquid.

The Laplace pressure is the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of a curved surface between a gas region and a liquid region. The Laplace pressure is determined from the Young–Laplace equation given as

&lt;math&gt;\Delta P \equiv P_\text{inside} - P_\text{outside} = \gamma\left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle R_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle R_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are the principal radii of curvature and &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \gamma }&lt;/math&gt; (also denoted as &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \sigma }&lt;/math&gt;) is the surface tension.

The surface tension can be defined in terms of force or energy. The surface tension of a liquid is the ratio of the change in the energy of the liquid, and the change in the surface area of the liquid (that led to the change in energy). It can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{W}{\Delta A}&lt;/math&gt;. This work W is interpreted as the potential energy.

'''Ice storage air conditioning '''is the process of using ice for [[thermal energy storage]]. This is practical because of water's large [[heat of fusion]]: one [[metric ton]] of water (one cubic metre) can store 334 [[megajoule]]s (MJ) (317,000 [[BTU]]) of energy, equivalent to 93 [[kWh]] (26.4 ton-hours).  

Ice was originally obtained from mountains or cut from frozen lakes and transported to cities for use as a coolant. The original definition of a "[[Ton of refrigeration|ton of cooling capacity]]" (heat flow) was the heat needed to melt one ton of ice in a 24-hour period.  This heat flow is what one would expect in a {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} house in Boston in the summer. This definition has since been replaced by less archaic units: one ton [[HVAC]] capacity is equal to 12,000 BTU per hour.  A small storage facility can hold enough ice to cool a large building from one day to one week, whether that ice is produced by [[anhydrous ammonia]] chillers or hauled in by horse-drawn carts. 

[[Ground freezing]] can also be utilized; this may be done in ice form where the ground is saturated. Systems will also work with pure rock. Wherever ice forms, the ice formation's heat of fusion is not used, as the ice remains solid throughout the process. The method based on ground freezing is widely used for mining and tunneling to solidify unstable ground during excavations. The ground is frozen using bore holes with concentric pipes that carry brine from a chiller at the surface. Cold is extracted in a similar way using brine and used in the same way as for conventional ice storage, normally with a brine-to-liquid heat exchanger, to bring the working temperatures up to usable levels at higher volumes. The frozen ground can stay cold for months or longer, allowing cold storage for extended periods at negligible structure cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2014/05/22/ice-storage-a-cost-efficient-way-to-cool-commercial-buildings-while-optimizing-the-power-grid/#5707ad8c1434|title=Ice Storage: A Cost-Efficient Way To Cool Commercial Buildings While Optimizing the Power Grid|first=Peter|last=Kelly-Detwiler|work=[[Forbes]]|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/05/ice-batteries-commissioned-by-utility-will-cool-california-businesses/|title=California utility augments 1,800 air conditioning units with “ice battery”|website=[[ARS Technica]]|date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replacing existing air conditioning systems with ice storage offers a cost-effective energy storage method, enabling surplus wind energy and other such intermittent energy sources to be stored for use in chilling at a later time, possibly months later.

== Air conditioning ==
The most widely used form of this technology can be found in campus-wide air conditioning or chilled water systems of large buildings. Air conditioning systems, especially in commercial buildings, are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads seen on hot summer days in various countries. In this application, a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile. Water then circulates through the pile during the day to produce chilled water that would normally be the chiller's daytime output.

A partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly 24 hours a day. At night, they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water for the air conditioning system. Water circulating through the melting ice augments their production. Such a system usually runs in ice-making mode for 16 to 18 hours a day and in ice-melting mode for six hours a day.  Capital expenditures are minimized because the chillers can be just 40 - 50% of the size needed for a conventional design. Ice storage sufficient to store half a day's rejected heat is usually adequate.

A full storage system minimizes the cost of energy to run that system by entirely shutting off the chillers during peak load hours. The capital cost is higher, as such a system requires somewhat larger chillers than those from a partial storage system, and a larger ice storage system. Ice storage systems are inexpensive enough that full storage systems are often competitive with conventional air conditioning designs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The air conditioning chillers' efficiency is measured by their [[coefficient of performance]] (COP). In theory, thermal storage systems could make chillers more efficient because heat is discharged into colder nighttime air rather than warmer daytime air. In practice, heat loss overpowers this advantage, since it melts the ice.

Air conditioning thermal storage has been shown to be somewhat beneficial in society. The [[fuel]] used at night to produce electricity is a domestic resource in most countries, so less imported fuel is used. Also, studies show that this process significantly reduces the emissions associated with producing the power for air conditioners, since in the evening, inefficient "peaker" plants are replaced by low-emission base load facilities. The plants that produce this power often work more efficiently than the [[gas turbine]]s that provide peaking power during the day. As well, since the [[load factor (electrical)|load factor]] on the plants is higher, fewer plants are needed to service the load.

A new twist on this technology uses ice as a condensing medium for the [[refrigerant]]. In this case, regular refrigerant is pumped to coils where it is used. Rather than needing a [[gas compressor|compressor]] to convert it back into a liquid, however, the low temperature of ice is used to chill the refrigerant back into a liquid. This type of system allows existing refrigerant-based HVAC equipment to be converted to Thermal Energy Storage systems, something that could not previously be easily done with chill water technology. In addition, unlike water-cooled chill water systems that do not experience a tremendous difference in efficiency from day to night, this new class of equipment typically displaces daytime operation of air-cooled condensing units. In areas where there is a significant difference between peak day time temperatures and off peak temperatures, this type of unit is typically more energy efficient than the equipment that it replaces. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Denis |last=Du Bois |title=Ice Energy's "Ice Bear" Keeps Off-Peak Kilowatts in Cold Storage to Reduce HVAC's Peak Power Costs |date=16 January 2007 |url=http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/01/ice_energy_peak_power.php |work =Energy Priorities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Combustion gas turbine air inlet cooling ==
Thermal energy storage is also used for combustion [[gas turbine]] air inlet cooling. Instead of shifting electrical demand to the night, this technique shifts generation capacity to the day. To generate ice at night, the turbine is often mechanically connected to a large chiller's compressor. During peak daytime loads, water is circulated between the ice pile and a [[heat exchanger]] in front of the turbine air intake, cooling the intake air to near freezing temperatures. Since the air is colder, the turbine can compress more air with a given amount of compressor power.  Typically, both the generated electrical power and turbine efficiency rise when the inlet cooling system is activated. This system is similar to the [[compressed air energy storage]] system.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''Leonard "Lynn" L. Northrup Jr.''' (March 18, 1918 &amp;ndash; March 24, 2016) was an American engineer who was a pioneer of the commercialization of solar thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.restlandfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Leonard-Nothrup/|title=You searched for Leonard-Nothrup|last=|first=|date=|website=Restland of Dallas {{!}} Funeral {{!}} Cremation {{!}} Cemetery|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nofrackingway.us/2016/03/25/lynn-northrup-solar-energy-pioneer/|title=Lynn Northrup Solar Energy Pioneer 1918 – 2016|last=|first=|date=2016-03-25|work=No Fracking Way|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the work of [[John Yellott]],
[[Maria Telkes]], and [[Harry Tabor]], Northrup's company designed, patented, developed and manufactured some of the first commercial solar water heaters, [[solar concentrator]]s, solar-powered air conditioning systems, [[solar power tower]]s and photovoltaic thermal hybrid systems in the United States. The company he founded became part of ARCO Solar, which in turn became [[BP Solar]], which became the largest solar energy company in the world. Northrup was a prolific inventor with 14 US patents.

==Early life, education, academia, and military service==
Lynn Northrup Jr., a fourth generation Texan, was the son of L. L. Northrup Sr., an inventor in his own right, and Dolly McKaskle Northrup, a retail entrepreneur, both members of pioneer Texas families. He was educated at [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Dallas, Texas)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Southern Methodist University]], a [[Master of Science|MS]] from the [[University of Denver]], and a [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Harvard Business School]].  Northrup served as a captain the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] during and shortly after [[World War II]].

==Early work in automotive and residential air conditioning==

After the War, Northrup went to work for Storm Vulcan, a Dallas company, where he invented a machine to clean [[aircraft engine]]s.&lt;ref name="patref1"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2825349}} Parts Cleansing Machines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="patref2"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2838289}} Means for Cleaning Equipment&lt;/ref&gt;  He also embarked on a venture to fit cars with air conditioning equipment, putting the machinery in the trunk and piping the cooled air through tubes in the [[headliner]]. This caught the interest of engineers from [[General Motors]], who copied the system in [[Cadillac]]s in the late 1940s. "After market" automotive AC units were manufactured in Texas until the 1980s.  He also sold some of the first [[air conditioning units]], built by the [[Curtis Mathes Corporation]], an early leader in manufacturing window units.&lt;ref  name="patref3"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|3977467}} Air Conditioning Module&lt;/ref&gt;  Northrup married Jane Keliher and started a family in Dallas, where he designed and built one of the first single-family houses in the United States with [[central air conditioning]]. He founded a company to install air conditioning in residential and commercial buildings. With a Marketing Plan from G F Sweetman (CEO of American Awards Co), he  became one of largest suppliers of Curtis Mathes fans and compressors in the nation. He also developed a company to manage, install, update, and clean air filtration systems.

==Commercialization of solar thermal technology in the US==

In the late 1960s, Northrup bought a controlling interest in Donmark Corporation,  a manufacturer of residential air conditioning and heating equipment from Curtis Mathes, his lifelong friend. Northrup promoted the use of “all electric” central heating and cooling equipment, building a manufacturing facility in Dallas and later in [[Hutchins, Texas]] and selling primarily to apartment developers. In designing these systems, Northrup focused on the total installed cost of the unit, including the framing and plumbing costs.

During the mid-1970s, Northrup became interested in boosting the efficiency of air conditioning systems, and began looking at novel approaches, including water-source [[geothermal]] heat pumps, and the innovative use of [[scroll compressor]]s in split system central air conditioning systems to achieve a higher [[Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|efficiency rating]], which have since become the standard compressor for high-efficiency residential air conditioning equipment.

In the early 1970s, before the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] and the spike in oil prices, Northrup became interested in the commercialization of solar thermal systems, particularly for heating potable water and swimming pools. Such systems had already been commercialized in other countries where climatic conditions were favorable, energy costs were high, and there was a tradition of scientific innovation notably [[solar power in Israel]]. Work in the United States had been limited to academia and a few companies in Arizona, Texas, and California. Northrup began experimenting with solar collectors to heat air, using finned heat exchangers, and engaged solar pioneer [[John Yellott|Professor John Yellott]] as a consultant on the [[Absorbance|absorptivity]] and [[emissivity]] or various surfaces and configurations, and on the transparency of various glasses and glazing material that exhibit the "greenhouse effect" - transparent to incoming solar radiation, but opaque to the re-radiation of infrared from the heated surface - hence a thermal trap or collector that exhibits the "[[greenhouse effect]]".

Additionally, he hired [[Maria Telkes]], an expert on [[phase change material]]s, particularly [[molten salt]]s, as a way to store thermal energy, and consulted with Israeli solar thermal pioneer [[Harry Tabor]] on surface coatings, including “black chrome” for solar panels. This work lead to the commercialization of flat panel [[solar water heater]]s, and solar pool heaters, marketed as Northrup Energy products directly and via dealers, with particular success in Hawaii, where [[Thermosiphon#Solar energy|solar thermosiphon]] systems could be used with antifreeze. With low temperature products in production and distribution, Northrup turned his attention to achieving higher temperatures – which would entail various methods of concentrating incoming insolation and tracking the sun - with varying degrees of success.

==First Commercial Tracking Concentrating Solar Collectors==

[[File:LexmarkAIOScan16.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|Fresnel lens solar collector]]Northrup’s break-through technology was a collector&lt;ref  name="patref4"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|3991741}} Roof-lens Solar Collector&lt;/ref&gt; that used a  long curved acrylic [[fresnel lens]] to concentrate or focus sunlight at a theoretical ratio of approximately 12 to 1 onto a linear flat copper tube, coated with a variant of Dr. Tabor's “black chrome” absorptive surface. The array, approximately 10’ long, tracked the movement of the sun during the day (east to west),  automatically, with the elevation generally fixed (at approximately the same angle from horizontal as the latitude of the installation). The tracking device was ingenious – it consisted of two photoelectric cells at the base of a tube with a baffle between them.  Current from the cells went to a control board that controlled the tracking motor. When the cell output was equalized, the baffle and the tube would be pointing at the sun. This was sufficient to enable the array to track the sun’s azimuth and generate considerable heat, as reported in tests published in the [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|ASHRAE]] Journal, which noted that ". . . the array of collectors . . .follow the sun from just after sunrise to just before sunset and often results in the collection of twice as many usable BTUs of energy at a higher temperature than provided by high quality flat plate collectors.".&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE Journal, November 1976 "Evaluating a Solar Energy Concentrator" Dr. Richard L. Pendleton&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daily tracking concentrating collectors.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|Popular Science Magazine Illustration, 1976]]
These arrays proved popular – and were used to drive [[Absorption refrigerator|absorption refrigeration]] equipment on large commercial installations at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL14884181M/Solar_project_description_for_Trinity_University_power_plant_2|title=Solar project description for Trinity University power plant #2 (Open Library)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Frenchman’s Reef Hotel in St Thomas, USVI, residences,&lt;ref&gt;Solar Engineering January 1976, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9&lt;/ref&gt;  and were sold to prominent individuals, including movie actor and entrepreneur [[Steve McQueen]], actor [[Stuart Whitman]] and environmentalist [[Robert Redford]].

The early success of these concentrating collectors was due in part to grants from the Department of Energy and its predecessor the Energy Research and Development Administration. They created a good deal of publicity for Northrup, Inc., including the cover of Popular Science Magazine&lt;ref&gt;Popular Science, October 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and an article in Fortune Magazine that noted, "By squeezing (sic) sunshine optically, Lynn Northrup's unique new rooftop solar collector produces higher temperatures than are obtainable from most solar heating systems now on the market".&lt;ref&gt;Fortune Magazine, February 1976, page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Technically, these concentrating collectors were among the first commercially successful “east-west” tracking solar collectors.  The fundamentals of their systems are still in use in daily azimuth and elevation tracking parabolic collectors. Most linear concentrating collectors are, as of this writing in 2010, of the less costly and less complicated seasonal tracking variety in the form of [[parabolic trough]]s.

==First Commercial Heliostats and Power Towers==

[[File:73 Solar Conf Photo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|1973 Solar Energy Conference. Left to right: Leonard L. Northrup Jr., Floyd Blake, the Australian representative (Dr. William Charters), Mrs. Northrup, Dr. Baum of Russia, Dr. John Yellott and Mrs. Yellot]]
Emboldened with his success in concentrating collectors, Northrup turned his attention to achieving higher temperatures, with azimuth and elevation tracking mirrors "heliostats" focused on a central boiler – ie. solar thermal [[Solar power tower|power towers]]. The most advanced power tower at the time was an experimental tower in France, the THEMIS solar [[Solar furnace|furnace]] at Odeillo, in the Pyrenees Orientales, which like other power towers, had been used solely for scientific purposes. Northrup attended a conference there in 1973 along with Professor Yellott and Floyd Blake, a former Martin Marietta senior aerospace engineer who had become interested in solar thermal research.

[[File:Northrup I.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|left|Northrup I Heliostat, 1978]] This interest led to hiring Blake and 16 other ex-aerospace engineers, who set up a research center in Littleton, Colorado, near Denver. The first Northrup, Inc. azimuth/elevation mirror array&lt;ref  name="patref5"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|4227513}} Solar System Having Improved Heliostat and Sensor Mountings&lt;/ref&gt; was built with Northrup, Inc funds and a grant from the State of Texas. Designed by Blake’s team, the mirror array, dubbed "Northrup I", was assembled at the Northrup Energy manufacturing plant near Hutchins, Texas.  It utilized multiple flat mirrors, with a weather-proof backing that became an industry standard. Each mirror was angled to the anticipated focal length to the central tower. Each moment of each year, each mirror had to be in a position to split the vectors between the mirror and the sun and the mirror and the target. This required a large volume of calculations, special computers and gearing mechanisms which Northrup designed. Team leader, Floyd Blake remembers, "Lynn climbed a ladder in front of the heliostats to take a picture of the sun reflected in them, then went up in a helicopter to be sure the heliostats were pointing correctly."

[[File:Northrup II.jpeg|thumb|right|Northrup II Heliostat, 1980]] Northrup, Inc. was soon an industry leader in pre-commercial and commercial power tower and heliostat installations,&lt;ref name="patref6"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|4276872}} Solar System Heliostats and Collectors&lt;/ref&gt; securing grants from  [[Nasa|NASA Huntsville]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]],  [[Sandia National Laboratories]], the [[United States Department of Energy]], and the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]].   Most of the heliostats, including the Northrup II, a commercial model, were developed under contract for the United States Department of Energy.  The heliostats focused radiation from the sun to generate temperatures up to 2,000 degrees at the target.  Northrup, Inc. joint-ventured with the [[Bechtel]] Corp., which was responsible for designing the heliostat's target, a steam boiler.

==ARCO Solar==

By the late 1970s, just five years after testing the first low temperature solar thermal collectors, Northrup Energy had become the preeminent developer of solar thermal technology. This attracted the attention of investors, and suitors, including the Atlantic Richfield Company, “ARCO”. ARCO's Chairman, [[Robert O Anderson]] was personally interested in solar technology and visited the Northrup Energy facility. Northrup, Inc. merged with Atlantic Richfield, and [[ARCO]] Ventures changed its name to ARCO Solar. The Northrup Energy team under Floyd Blake and Jerry Anderson went on to design and build some of the first commercial solar power tower installations, notably [[The Solar Project#Solar One|"Solar One"]] near Barstow, California.  The heat from another project was used to generate steam for tertiary oil recovery in Kern County, California and for electric power generation. Some heliostats were built to directly track the sun with arrays of photovoltaic cells to generate power for the utility grid, near Hesperia, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Design, installation and performance of the ARCO Solar one-megawatt power plant | bibcode=1984pvse.conf..314A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The seven million watt installation near Barstow was later dismantled and shipped to [[PS10 solar power tower|Europe's first commercial solar thermal power station]]. This unit was the largest solar electric power generation facility in the world. Northrup and Blake were then featured in a documentary on solar energy, ''Harnessing the Sun'',&lt;ref name="harnessingthesunimdb"&gt;{{IMDb title|0278473|Harnessing the Sun|(1980)}}&lt;/ref&gt; narrated by actress [[Joan Hackett]].

[[File:Arco heliostat photovoltaic array.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|right|Heliostat Photovoltaic Array]] ARCO Solar increasingly concentrated on the development of solar photovoltaic systems and was subsequently sold first to Seimens, then to British Petroleum (now "BP"), where [[BP Solar]] became the largest solar photovoltaic company in the world.

Northrup’s designs and work in flat plate solar thermal collectors, east–west tracking collectors and heliostats are still in use today and serve as the foundations of solar thermal technology. To acknowledge Prof. John Yellott's contributions to the advancements of solar thermal systems, Northrup endowed a chair at Arizona State in Yellott's honor. Northrup has, in turn, been honored for his contributions to the commercialization of solar technologies by the [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]].

==Work In Real Estate and Architectural Systems==

[[File:Cistercian Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|Cistercian Chapel]] After the merger of Northrup, Inc. into ARCO, Northrup became engaged in real estate development, including the assembly of one of the largest tracts of land in downtown Dallas, where he entered into a joint venture with [[James Rouse]]’s Enterprise Development Company to build a festival marketplace.  This project was sold to a Belgian investment group who failed to pursue the project with Rouse. Northrup helped fund the establishment of Rouse's [[Enterprise Foundation]] affordable housing projects in Dallas. He also assembled tracts on 1½ miles of shoreline on Lewisville Lake, a part of which later became the city of The Colony.  Northrup acquired 5,000 acres outside San Antonio, Texas, which was put into a trust for his family, and assembled land now occupied by the regional Rolex headquarters, among others.
 
Northrup subsequently started American Limestone, an innovator in using surface quarried Texas limestone in building facades, using a patented method&lt;ref  name="patref7"&gt;{{Cite patent|US|5473851}} Limestone Curtain Wall System and Method&lt;/ref&gt; that employs thin panels of limestone as a veneer, attached to a metal grid without mortar. This popularized the use of rough cut limestone as a thin veneer in residential and commercial applications, including store fronts, such as Brooks Brothers, churches, bank buildings and municipal buildings.  At the other extreme in size, Northrup has utilized massive blocks of limestone for their passive heating / cooling characteristics, and free-standing structural qualities, most notably donating the stone and devising the construction technique for the Cistercian Chapel in Irving, Texas, which reflects both a classic design aesthetic and construction technique of mortar-less masonry  - a thoroughly modern building built in the rational style of [[Cistercian architecture]]. The architect, Gary Cunningham, said "We wanted to build a church that would literally last for the next 900 years".&lt;ref&gt;Architecture October 1992 p 61- 70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[Silene]]''''' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including:

;[[Phagy|Monophagous]] species which feed exclusively on ''Silene'':

*''[[Coleophora]]'' case-bearers:
:*''[[Coleophora apicialbella|C. apicialbella]]''
:*''[[Coleophora nutantella|C. nutantella]]''
:*''[[Coleophora otitae|C. otitae]]''
:*''[[Coleophora silenella|C. silenella]]''

;[[Phagy|Polyphagous]] species which feed on ''Silene'' among other plants:

*''[[Coleophora]]'' case-bearers:
:*''[[Coleophora corsicella|C. corsicella]]'' (recorded on ''[[Silene nutans|S. nutans]]'')
:*''[[Coleophora leucapennella|C. leucapennella]]''
:*''[[Coleophora lithargyrinella|C. lithargyrinella]]'' (recorded on ''[[Silene vulgaris|S. vulgaris]]'')
*[[Cabbage moth]], ''Mamestra brassicae''
*[[Grey chi]], ''Antitype chi''
*[[Lime-speck pug]], ''Eupithecia centaureata''
*[[Lychnis (moth)|Lychnis]], ''Hadena bicruris''
*[[Shark (moth)|Shark]], ''Cucullia umbratica''

This is a list of [[river|rivers]] in the continental United States by average [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] (streamflow) in cubic feet per second. All rivers with average discharge more than 15,000 cubic feet per second are listed. Estimates are approximate, because data are variable with time period measured and also because many rivers lack a [[stream gauge|gauging station]] near their point of outflow.

'''MV ''Shelly''''' was a {{GRT|1837}} [[cargo ship]] that was built in [[Bulgaria]] in 1973. She sank off the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast of [[Israel]] in 2007 after the {{GRT|10392}} [[cruise ship]] {{ship|CS|Salamis Glory}} rammed her and broke her in two. Two of ''Shelly''{{'}}s crew were killed.

==Ship==

She changed hands in 1999 and was renamed ''Loti''. She changed hands again in 2002 and was renamed ''Dora''. In 2003 Israeli owners bought her, renamed her ''Shelly'' and [[Ship registration|registered]] her in [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=17363 |last=Kermen |first=Ilhan |title=Zlatograd – IMO 7306673 |publisher=Shipspotting.com |date=14 June 2008 |accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was crewed not by Israelis but by other nationalities,&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/31/AR2007083100575.html |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Israeli Divers Find Bodies of 2 Sailors |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly Slovaks and [[Ukraine|Ukrainians]].&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

==Collision and sinking==
On 30 August 2007, ''Shelly'' was at anchor about {{convert|3|km|nmi|disp=flip}} off Israeli coast, near the [[port of Haifa]], when at about 10pm she was accidentally rammed by the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] passenger ship ''Salamis Glory'', which had left port at Haifa several minutes before.&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/899674.html |last1=Eyadat |first1=Fadi |last2=Azoulay |first2=Yuval |title=Rescuers retrieve bodies of two sailors killed in collision off Haifa |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=1 September 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shelly'' sank quickly after the collision, which the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] said broke her in half.&lt;ref name=J-Post&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Bodies-of-missing-seamen-found-after-Haifa-ship-collision |last=Leshem |first=Elie |title=Bodies of missing seamen found after Haifa ship collision |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 crew members escaped, and most climbed aboard a rescue launch lowered by ''Salamis Glory'' and were subsequently rescued by the [[Israeli Navy]].&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt; The rest were rescued by helicopter.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; The survivors refused to be taken to a local hospital for treatment.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; ''Salamis Glory'' subsequently returned to port in Haifa, showing slight damage to her hull.&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt; None of ''Salamis Glory''{{'}}s 700 or so passengers and crew was injured.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

The remaining two crew members were declared missing, prompting a search and rescue operation involving six naval vessels, multiple aircraft and divers.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; 12 hours after the sinking their bodies were recovered from the wreck by divers&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt; in {{convert|20|m}} of water.&lt;ref name=J-Post/&gt; The dead were identified as the ship's [[Indonesia]]n [[Chief mate|First Mate]] and Ukrainian [[Chief engineer|engineer]].&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

The vessel's sinking released an [[oil spill]] that moved down the coast, causing authorities to warn the public not to bathe at the nearby Zevulun beach.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

On 31 August Salamis Lines, owners of ''Salamis Glory'', arranged for 148 stranded Cypriot passengers from the ship to be flown back to Cyprus on a [[Cyprus Airways]] jet.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=34469&amp;cat_id=1 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202840/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=34469&amp;cat_id=1 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 27 September 2007 |last=Leonidou |first=Leo |title=Cruise passengers return home after accident |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |date=2 September 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
[[Israeli Police]] launched a full investigation into the cause of the accident, aided by Cypriot authorities.&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt; All of ''Salamis Glory''{{'}}s crew were interviewed. One possibility being considered was that there was a fault in the ship's navigation system,&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt; with some reports of a loss of steering control aboard ''Salamis Glory''.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

The '''March 2010 nor'easter''' or '''St. Patrick's Day nor'easter''' was a powerful [[nor'easter]] that impacted the [[Northeastern United States]] and [[Eastern Canada]] from March 12–16, 2010, resulting in at least nine deaths. The slow-moving storm produced over {{convert|10|in|cm}} of rain in New England, causing widespread flooding of urban and low-lying areas.  Winds of up to {{convert|70|mph|km/h}} snapped trees and power lines, resulting in over 1 million homes and businesses left without electricity.  The storm also caused extensive coastal flooding and beach erosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/03/15/stubborn-storm-darkens-floods-northeast/ Stubborn Storm Darkens, Floods Northeast, Fox News Channel, Accessed March 16, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[nor'easter]] was the fifth major winter storm to impact the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] in the [[Global storm activity of 2010|2009–10 North American winter storm season]].

==Synoptic conditions==
The winter storm that would impact the Northeastern United States evolved when an area of low pressure moved northeastward from [[Texas]] to the [[Great Lakes]] region on March 10 and 11.  A secondary low pressure center developed near [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]] and drifted northward to a position south of [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]] by March 14.  The system contained abundant moisture feeds from the tropical [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]].  Unlike the previous three winter storms that affected the region in February, there was a lack of cold air with this system and precipitation with this storm fell primarily as rain.

Light to moderate rain spread north across the entire region through the day on Friday as the low pressure drifted north and slowly strengthened. With a strong fetch off the Atlantic Ocean, rainfall rates became heavy overnight Friday and through the evening of Saturday March 13th, resulting in small stream and eventually major river flooding. Meanwhile, a high pressure system anchored in the Canadian Maritimes also strengthened and a very strong pressure gradient developed between these pressure systems overnight Friday. This resulted in strong, damaging easterly winds across much of the area through the day Saturday, especially along the New Jersey coast where minor to moderate coastal flooding also occurred. The strong winds and widespread heavy rains slackened off overnight Saturday as the surface low was stationary across the Delmarva region. Showers and even a few thunderstorms continued to rotate in off of the Atlantic through the day on Sunday March 14th and continued into Monday March 15th as the low slowly moved eastward and finally out to sea by Tuesday morning March 16th.

==Impacts==

===Connecticut===
Winds of up to {{convert|70|mph|km/h}} toppled trees and snapped power lines, with the heaviest damage reported in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].  Falling trees damaged or destroyed several homes in Connecticut, and the destruction was the worst experienced in Fairfield County since [[Hurricane Gloria]] struck the state in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local-beat/High-Winds 30 to 40 mph with gusts to 50-65-Heavy-Rains in some places up to 11 inches!-Punish-Connecticut-87597557.html Power Out, Schools Closed for 3rd Day, WVIT TV, Hartford, CT, Accessed March 16, 2010]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the storm on March 14, more than 110,000 customers were without electricity.  By March 16, [[Connecticut Light and Power]] (CL&amp;P) reported that 40,000 customers remained in the dark, and public schools remained closed for the entire week. Governor [[M. Jodi Rell]] criticized CL&amp;P and promised an investigation after reports surfaced that the company delayed efforts to restore power to reduce employee overtime costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/weather/unions-say-clp-delayed-restoring-power Unions:  Connecticut Light &amp; Power Delayed Restoring Power, WTNH TV, New Haven, CT, Accessed March 16, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maine===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Massachusetts===
Up to {{convert|10|in|cm}} of rain combined with rapidly melting snow from earlier storms caused widespread urban flooding and forced rivers out of their banks across the state.  Governor [[Deval Patrick]] declared a state of emergency and activated the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to assist in the storm's aftermath.  Flooding also shut down sections of commuter rail lines heading into and out of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], and caused sewage to overflow from treatment plants and into [[Boston Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/22857378/detail.html Mayor: State Flooded My City, WCVB TV, Accessed March 16, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322201711/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/22857378/detail.html |date=March 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Hampshire===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===New Jersey===
New Jersey was particularly hard hit with flooding and wind damage and a state of emergency was declared as a result. The strong winds which frequently gusted 50-60&amp;nbsp;mph in most areas and up to 70&amp;nbsp;mph in spots wreaked the most havoc statewide, toppling numerous trees onto roads, cars, houses, and power lines causing widespread power outages. In Middlesex County, a large tree fell on a vehicle injuring two people. Wind and rain forced the closure of parts of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], a near complete shutdown of the [[New Jersey Transit|NJ Transit]] system, and toppled a high rise crane in Atlantic City, NJ causing dangerous debris to drop to the ground. PSE&amp;G reported about 459,000 customers lost power during the height of the storm on Saturday March 13th, making it the worst storm in the utility's history.

On Friday morning March 19th, nearly a week after the storm, 2,200 people in the state were still without power and many folks along the Passaic river in northeastern New Jersey were still dealing with major flooding. Thousands of businesses and residents in flood prone areas across the state received damage where major flooding occurred. Officials say more than 1,300 buildings in Morris County alone were damaged because of flooding along the Passaic, Ramapo and Pompton rivers. Preliminary estimates from flooding and wind damage in New Jersey alone are in the millions of dollars. Elsewhere in the area, flooding and wind damage was not as severe, but impacts from minor river flooding and downed trees and power lines were still felt in many areas.

===New York===
The New York Metro area experienced intense conditions during the height of the storm which dropped on average 3-6" of rain along with wind gusts over 75&amp;nbsp;mph. The hardest hit location in the metro area was Brooklyn, NY which experienced over 6" of rain and wind gusts up to 85&amp;nbsp;mph. Long Island got hammered with hurricane-force wind gusts of 75-85&amp;nbsp;mph and heavy bands of rain. Many power outages were reported.

===Pennsylvania===
In southeastern Pennsylvania, PECO said that 135,000 customers lost power in the Philadelphia region, with [[Bucks County]] bearing the brunt. All of these customers had their power restored by Tuesday March 16th.

===Rhode Island===
The state of Rhode Island received very heavy rain from the storm, and the [[Pawtuxet River]] flooded many towns in the state. Winds exceeded 50&amp;nbsp;mph at times and roadways were closed in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="924">'''Neurophysins''' are [[carrier protein]]s which transport the hormones [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] to the [[posterior pituitary]] from the [[paraventricular nucleus|paraventricular]] and [[supraoptic nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]], respectively. 

Neurophysins are also secreted out of the posterior pituitary hypothalamus, each carrying their respective associated passenger hormone. When the posterior pituitary hypothalamus secretes vasopressin and its neurophysin carrier, it also secretes a [[glycopeptide]].

There are two types:

* [[Neurophysin I]] - [[Oxytocin]]
* [[Neurophysin II]] - [[Vasopressin]] (Also known as "antidiuretic hormone" or ADH)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7498">In [[chemistry]], a '''nitride''' is a compound of [[nitrogen]] where nitrogen has a formal [[oxidation state]] of −3. Nitrides are a large class of compounds with a wide range of properties and applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nitride ion, N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, is never encountered in [[protic solvent|protic solution]] because it is so [[base (chemistry)|basic]] that it would be [[protonation|protonated]] immediately. Its [[ionic radius]] is estimated to be 140 pm.

==Uses of nitrides==
Like [[carbide]]s, nitrides are often [[refractory material]]s owing to their high [[lattice energy]] which reflects the strong attraction of "N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;" for the metal cation. Thus, [[titanium nitride]] and [[silicon nitride]] are used as cutting materials and hard coatings. Hexagonal [[boron nitride]], which adopts a layered structure, is a useful high-temperature lubricant akin to [[molybdenum disulfide]]. Nitride compounds often have large [[band gap]]s, thus nitrides are usually [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s or [[wide bandgap semiconductors]]; examples include [[boron nitride]] and silicon nitride.  The wide band gap material [[gallium nitride]] is prized for emitting blue light in [[LED]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chemistry of Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides |editor-first=S. T. |editor-last=Oyama |publisher=Blackie Academic |date=1996 |ISBN=0-7514-0365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H. O. |last=Pierson |date=1996|title=Handbook of refractory carbides and nitrides |publisher=William Andrew |ISBN=0-8155-1392-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like some oxides, nitrides can absorb hydrogen and have been discussed in the context of [[hydrogen storage]], e.g. [[lithium nitride]].

==Examples==
Classification of such a varied group of compounds is somewhat arbitrary.  Compounds where nitrogen is not assigned −3 oxidation state are not included, such as [[nitrogen trichloride]] where the oxidation state is +3; nor are [[ammonia]] and its many organic derivatives.

===Nitrides of the s-block elements===
Only one [[alkali metal]] nitride is stable, the purple-reddish [[lithium nitride]] (Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N), which forms when lithium burns in an atmosphere of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0010-8545(01)00320-4|title=Nitride chemistry of the s-block elements|year=2001|last1=Gregory|first1=Duncan H.|journal=Coord. Chem. Rev.|volume=215|pages=301–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sodium nitride]] has been generated, but remains a laboratory curiosity. The nitrides of the [[alkaline earth metal]]s have the formula M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are however numerous.  Examples include [[beryllium nitride|Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[magnesium nitride|Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[calcium nitride|Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Strontium nitride|Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].  The nitrides of electropositive metals (including Li, Zn, and the alkaline earth metals) readily hydrolyze upon contact with water, including the moisture in the air:
:Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  6&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   3&amp;nbsp;Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + 2&amp;nbsp;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Nitrides of the p-block elements===
[[Boron nitride]] exists as several forms ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s). Nitrides of [[silicon nitride|silicon]] and phosphorus are also known, but only the former is commercially important. The nitrides of [[aluminium nitride|aluminium]], [[gallium nitride|gallium]], and [[indium nitride|indium]] adopt diamond-like [[Wurtzite (crystal structure)|wurtzite structure]] in which each atom occupies tetrahedral sites. For example, in aluminium nitride, each aluminium atom has four neighboring nitrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron and similarly each nitrogen atom has four neighboring aluminium atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. This structure is like hexagonal diamond ([[lonsdaleite]]) where every carbon atom occupies a tetrahedral site (however wurtzite differs from [[sphalerite]] and [[diamond]] in the relative orientation of tetrahedra). [[Thallium nitride|Thallium(I) nitride]], Tl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N is known, but thallium(III) nitride, TlN, is not.

===Transition metal nitrides===
{{see also|Zirconium nitride|Tungsten nitride|Vanadium nitride|Tantalum nitride|Niobium nitride}}

For the [[group 3 element|group 3]] metals, ScN and [[yttrium nitride|YN]] are both known. [[Group 4 element|Group 4]], [[group 5 element|5]], and [[group 6 element|6]] transition metals, that is the titanium, vanadium and chromium groups all form nitrides.  They are [[refractory]], with high melting point and are chemically stable.  Representative is [[titanium nitride]]. Sometimes these materials are called "[[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] nitrides."

Nitrides of the [[group 7 element|Group 7]] and [[group 8 element|8]] transition metals decompose readily. For example, [[iron nitride]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N decomposes at 200&amp;nbsp;°C. Platinum nitride and osmium nitride may contain N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units, and as such should not be called nitrides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gold film with gold nitride—A conductor but harder than gold|first1= L. |last1=Siller |first2=N. |last2=Peltekis |first3=S. |last3=Krishnamurthy|first4=Y. |last4=Chao |first5=S.

{{see also|Silver nitride|Mercury nitride}}
Nitrides of heavier members from group [[group 11 element|11]] and [[group 12 element|12]] are less stable than copper nitride, Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N and [[zinc nitride|Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]: dry silver nitride (Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) is a [[contact explosive]] which may detonate from the slightest touch, even a falling water droplet.&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ie00059a023|title=The Chemistry and Free Energy Formation of Silver Nitride|first1=Edward S. |last1=Shanley |first2=John L.|last2= Ennis|journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.|year=1991|volume=30|issue=11|page=2503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular nitrides===
[[Image:Tetrasulfur-tetranitride.png|thumb|left|S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a prototypical binary molecular nitride.]]
{{main|Transition metal nitrido complex}}

Many metals form molecular nitrido complexes, as discussed in the specialized article.  The [[main group element]]s also form some molecular nitrides. [[Cyanogen]] ((CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[tetrasulfur tetranitride]] (S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are rare examples of a molecular binary (containing one element aside from nitrogen) nitrides.  They dissolve in nonpolar solvents.  Both undergo polymerization.  S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is also unstable with respect to the elements, but less so that the isostructural Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  Heating S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives a polymer, and a variety of molecular sulfur nitride anions and cations are also known.

Related to but distinct from nitride is [[pernitride]], {{chem|N|2|2−}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8114">[[Fluorine]] forms [[diatomic molecule]]s ({{chem|F|2}}) that are gaseous at room temperature with a density about 1.3 times that of air.{{sfn|Jaccaud et al.|2005|p=2}}{{#tag:ref|Density of air at 100&amp;nbsp;[[kilopascal]] and 0&amp;nbsp;°C is 1.2724&amp;nbsp;g/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shelquist |first=Richard |year=2010 |title=An introduction to air density and density altitude calculations|url = http://wahiduddin.net/calc/density_altitude.htm|publisher=Shelquist Engineering|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} Though sometimes cited as yellow-green, pure fluorine gas is actually a very pale yellow. The color can only be observed in concentrated fluorine gas when looking down the axis of long tubes, as it appears transparent when observed from the side in normal tubes or if allowed to escape into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burdon | first1 = J. | last2 = Emson | first2 = B. | last3 = Edwards | first3 = A.

[[File:Liquid fluorine tighter crop.jpg|thumb|Liquid fluorine]]

Fluorine condenses to a bright yellow liquid at −188&amp;nbsp;°C (−307&amp;nbsp;°F),{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=523}} which is near the condensation temperatures of oxygen and nitrogen.  &lt;!--- add density, heat capacity info--&gt;

The solid state of fluorine relies on [[Van der Waals force]]s to hold molecules together,{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} which, because of the small size of the [[fluorine]] molecules, are relatively weak. Consequently, the solid state of fluorine is more similar to that of oxygen or the noble gases than to those of the heavier halogens.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
[[File:Beta-fluorine_crystal_structure.gif|thumb|Animation showing the crystal structure of beta-fluorine.]]

Fluorine solidifies at −220&amp;nbsp;°C (−363&amp;nbsp;°F){{sfn|Dean|1999|p=523}} into a [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] structure, called beta-fluorine. This [[phase (matter)|phase]] is transparent and soft, with significant disorder of the molecules; its density is 1.70&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. At −228&amp;nbsp;°C (−378&amp;nbsp;°F) fluorine undergoes a solid–solid [[phase transition]] into a [[monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] structure called alpha-fluorine. This phase is opaque and hard, with close-packed layers of molecules, and is denser at 1.97&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v49/i4/p1902_s1&lt;/ref&gt; The solid state phase change requires more energy than the melting point transition and can be violent, shattering samples and blowing out sample holder windows.&lt;ref name="phases"&gt;{{cite report|last=Young|first=David A.|publisher=Springer|title=Phase Diagrams of the Elements|page=10|year=1975|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/4010212-0BbwUC/4010212.pdfaccess|accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = C.

&lt;!--- add density, heat capacity info--&gt;

Solid fluorine received significant study in the 1920s and 30s, but relatively less until the 1960s. The crystal structure of alpha-fluorine given, which still has some uncertainty, dates to a 1970 paper by [[Linus Pauling]].

A '''power station''', also referred to as a '''power plant''' or '''powerhouse''' and sometimes '''generating station''' or '''generating plant''', is an industrial facility for the [[Electricity generation|generation]] of [[electric power]]. Most power stations contain one or more [[Electric generator|generators]], a rotating machine that converts [[mechanical power]] into [[electrical power]]. The [[relative motion]] between a [[magnetic field]] and a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] creates an [[electrical current]]. The energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power stations in the world burn [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], [[petroleum|oil]], and [[natural gas]] to generate electricity. Others use [[nuclear power]], but there is an increasing use of cleaner [[renewable energy|renewable sources]] such as [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], [[Wave power|wave]] and [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]].

==History==
In 1870 a hydroelectric power station was designed and built by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Lord Armstrong]] at [[Cragside]], [[England]]. It used water from lakes on his estate to power [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] [[dynamo]]s. The electricity supplied power to lights, heating, produced hot water, ran an elevator as well as labor-saving devices and farm buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-21586177|title=Hydro-electricity restored to historic Northumberland home|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1870s Belgian inventor [[Zénobe Gramme]] invented a generator powerful enough to produce power on a commercial scale for industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Silvanus Phillips|title=Dynamo-electric Machinery: A Manual for Students of Electrotechnics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i34AAAAAMAAJ|year=1888|publisher=E. &amp; F. N. Spon|location=London|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1882, a central station providing public power was built in [[Godalming]], England. It was proposed after the town failed to reach an agreement on the rate charged by the gas company, so the town council decided to use electricity. It used hydroelectric power for street lighting and household lighting. The system was not a commercial success and the town reverted to gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNeil|first1=Ian|title=An Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-14792-7|page=369|edition=[New ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 the world's first coal-fired public power station, the [[Edison Electric Light Station]], was built in London, a project of [[Thomas Edison]] organized by [[Edward Hibberd Johnson|Edward Johnson]]. A [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] boiler powered a 125-horsepower steam engine that drove a 27-ton generator. This supplied electricity to premises in the area that could be reached through the [[culvert]]s of the viaduct without digging up the road, which was the monopoly of the gas companies. The customers included the [[City Temple (London)|City Temple]] and the [[Old Bailey]]. Another important customer was the Telegraph Office of the [[General Post Office#Headquarters|General Post Office]], but this could not be reached though the culverts. Johnson arranged for the supply cable to be run overhead, via Holborn Tavern and [[Newgate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfVKt7UzjnEC&amp;pg=PA89 |journal=[[New Scientist]] |title=The electricity of Holborn |author=Jack Harris |date=14 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1882 in New York, the [[Pearl Street Station]] was established by Edison to provide electric lighting in the lower Manhattan Island area. The station ran until destroyed by fire in 1890. The station used reciprocating [[steam engine]]s to turn direct-current generators. Because of the DC distribution, the service area was small, limited by voltage drop in the feeders. In 1886 [[George Westinghouse]] began building an alternating current system that used a transformer to step up voltage for long-distance transmission and then stepped it back down for indoor lighting, a more efficient and less expensive system which is similar to modern system. The [[War of Currents]] eventually resolved in favor of AC distribution and utilization, although some DC systems persisted to the end of the 20th century. DC systems with a service radius of a mile (kilometer) or so were necessarily smaller, less efficient of fuel consumption, and more labor-intensive to operate than much larger central AC generating stations.

AC systems used a wide range of [[Utility frequency|frequencies]] depending on the type of load; lighting load using higher frequencies, and traction systems and heavy motor load systems preferring lower frequencies. The economics of central station generation improved greatly when unified light and power systems, operating at a common frequency, were developed. The same generating plant that fed large industrial loads during the day, could feed commuter railway systems during rush hour and then serve lighting load in the evening, thus improving the system [[load factor (electrical)|load factor]] and reducing the cost of electrical energy overall. Many exceptions existed, generating stations were dedicated to power or light by the choice of frequency, and rotating [[frequency changer]]s and rotating converters were particularly common to feed electric railway systems from the general lighting and power network.

Throughout the first few decades of the 20th century central stations became larger, using higher steam pressures to provide greater efficiency, and relying on interconnections of multiple generating stations to improve reliability and cost. High-voltage AC transmission allowed [[hydroelectric power]] to be conveniently moved from distant waterfalls to city markets. The advent of the [[steam turbine]] in central station service, around 1906, allowed great expansion of generating capacity. Generators were no longer limited by the power transmission of belts or the relatively slow speed of reciprocating engines, and could grow to enormous sizes. For example, [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]] planned what would have been the largest reciprocating steam engine ever built for a proposed new central station, but scrapped the plans when turbines became available in the necessary size. Building power systems out of central stations required combinations of engineering skill and financial acumen in equal measure. Pioneers of central station generation include [[George Westinghouse]] and [[Samuel Insull]] in the United States, Ferranti and [[Charles Hesterman Merz]] in UK, and many others.

==Thermal power stations==
{{Main|Thermal power station}}
[[File:Dampfturbine Laeufer01.jpg|thumb|upright|Rotor of a modern steam turbine, used in a power station]]
In thermal power stations, mechanical power is produced by a [[heat engine]] that transforms [[thermal energy]], often from [[combustion]] of a [[fuel]], into rotational energy. Most thermal power stations produce steam, so they are sometimes called steam power stations. Not all thermal energy can be transformed into mechanical power, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]; therefore, there is always heat lost to the environment. If this loss is employed as useful heat, for industrial processes or [[district heating]], the power plant is referred to as a [[cogeneration]] power plant or CHP (combined heat-and-power) plant. In countries where district heating is common, there are dedicated heat plants called [[heat-only boiler station]]s. An important class of power stations in the Middle East uses by-product heat for the [[desalination]] of water.

The efficiency of a thermal power cycle is limited by the maximum working fluid temperature produced. The efficiency is not directly a function of the fuel used. For the same steam conditions, coal-, nuclear- and gas power plants all have the same theoretical efficiency. Overall, if a system is on constantly (base load) it will be more efficient than one that is used intermittently (peak load). Steam turbines generally operate at higher efficiency when operated at full capacity.

Besides use of reject heat for process or district heating, one way to improve overall efficiency of a power plant is to combine two different thermodynamic cycles in a [[combined cycle]] plant. Most commonly, [[exhaust gas]]es from a gas turbine are used to generate steam for a boiler and a steam turbine. The combination of a "top" cycle and a "bottom" cycle produces higher overall efficiency than either cycle can attain alone.

====By heat source====
* [[Fossil-fuel power station]]s may also use a steam turbine generator or in the case of [[natural gas]]-fired plants may use a [[gas turbine|combustion turbine]]. A coal-fired power station produces heat by burning coal in a steam boiler. The steam drives a [[steam turbine]] and [[electric generator|generator]]  that then produces [[electricity]]. The waste products of combustion include ash, [[sulphur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Some of the gases can be removed from the waste stream to reduce pollution. 
* [[Nuclear power plant]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/cgi-bin/db.page.pl/pris.oprconst.htm Nuclear Power Plants Information], by [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; use the heat generated in a [[nuclear reactor]]'s core (by the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] process) to create steam which then operates a steam turbine and generator. About 20 percent of electric generation in the USA is produced by nuclear power plants.
* [[Geothermal power]] plants use steam extracted from hot underground rocks. These rocks are heated by the decay of radioactive material in the Earth's crust.
* [[Biomass#Biomass conversion process to useful energy|Biomass-fuelled power plants]] may be fuelled by [[bagasse|waste from sugar cane]], [[Incineration|municipal solid waste]], landfill [[methane]], or other forms of [[biomass]].
* In integrated [[steel mill]]s, [[Blast furnace gas|blast furnace exhaust gas]] is a low-cost, although low-energy-density, fuel.
* [[Cogeneration|Waste heat from industrial processes]] is occasionally concentrated enough to use for power generation, usually in a steam boiler and turbine.
* [[Solar power|Solar thermal]] electric plants use sunlight to boil water and produce steam which turns the generator.

====By prime mover====
* [[Steam turbine]] plants use the dynamic pressure generated by expanding steam to turn the blades of a turbine. Almost all large non-hydro plants use this system. About 90 percent of all electric power produced in the world is through use of steam turbines.&lt;ref Name="Wiser"&gt;{{cite book |title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|last= Wiser |first=Wendell H. |authorlink= Wendell H. Wiser |year= 2000 |publisher= Birkhäuser |isbn= 978-0-387-98744-6 |page= 190 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UmMx9ixu90kC&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gas turbine]] plants use the dynamic pressure from flowing gases (air and combustion products) to directly operate the turbine. Natural-gas fuelled (and oil fueled) combustion turbine plants can start rapidly and so are used to supply "peak" energy during periods of high demand, though at higher cost than base-loaded plants. These may be comparatively small units, and sometimes completely unmanned, being remotely operated. This type was pioneered by the UK, [[Pocket Power Stations|Princetown]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swehs.co.uk/docs/news13su.html SWEB's Pocket Power Stations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055822/http://www.swehs.co.uk/docs/news13su.html |date=4 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; being the world's first, commissioned in 1959.
* [[Combined cycle]] plants have both a gas turbine fired by natural gas, and a steam boiler and steam turbine which use the hot exhaust gas from the gas turbine to produce electricity. This greatly increases the overall efficiency of the plant, and many new baseload power plants are combined cycle plants fired by natural gas.
* Internal combustion [[reciprocating engine]]s are used to provide power for isolated communities and are frequently used for small cogeneration plants. Hospitals, office buildings, industrial plants, and other critical facilities also use them to provide backup power in case of a power outage. These are usually fuelled by diesel oil, heavy oil, [[natural gas]], and [[landfill gas]].
* [[Gas turbine#Microturbines|Microturbines]], [[Stirling engine]] and internal combustion reciprocating engines are low-cost solutions for using opportunity fuels, such as [[landfill gas]], digester gas from water treatment plants and waste gas from oil production.

====By duty====
Power plants that can be dispatched (scheduled) to provide energy to a system include:
* [[Base load power plant]]s run nearly continually to provide that component of system load that doesn't vary during a day or week. Baseload plants can be highly optimized for low fuel cost, but may not start or stop quickly during changes in system load. Examples of base-load plants would include large modern coal-fired and nuclear generating stations, or hydro plants with a predictable supply of water. 
* [[Peaking power plant]]s meet the daily peak load, which may only be for one or two hours each day. While their incremental operating cost is always higher than base load plants, they are required to ensure security of the system during load peaks. Peaking plants include simple cycle gas turbines and sometimes reciprocating internal combustion engines, which can be started up rapidly when system peaks are predicted. Hydroelectric plants may also be designed for peaking use.  
* [[Load following power plant]]s can economically follow the variations in the daily and weekly load, at lower cost than peaking plants and with more flexibility than baseload plants.

Non-dispatchable plants include such sources as wind and solar energy; while their long-term contribution to system energy supply is predictable, on a short-term (daily or hourly) base their energy must be used as available since generation cannot be deferred. Contractual arrangements ("take or pay") with independent power producers or system interconnections to other networks may be effectively non-dispatchable.

===Cooling towers===
{{main|Cooling tower}}
[[File:RatcliffePowerPlantBlackAndWhite.jpg|thumb|[[Cooling tower]]s showing evaporating water at [[Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station]], [[United Kingdom]]]]
[[File:Cooling tower power station Dresden.jpg|thumb|"[[Camouflaged]]" natural draft wet [[cooling tower]]]]

All thermal power plants produce [[waste heat]] energy as a byproduct of the useful electrical energy produced. The amount of waste heat energy equals or exceeds the amount of energy converted into useful electricity. Gas-fired power plants can achieve as much as 65 percent conversion efficiency, while coal and oil plants achieve around 30 to 49 percent. The waste heat produces a temperature rise in the atmosphere, which is small compared to that produced by [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions from the same power plant. Natural draft wet [[cooling tower]]s at many nuclear power plants and large fossil fuel-fired power plants use large [[hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid]] [[chimney]]-like structures (as seen in the image at the right) that release the waste heat to the ambient atmosphere by the [[evaporation]] of water.

However, the mechanical induced-draft or forced-draft wet cooling towers in many large thermal power plants, nuclear power plants, fossil-fired power plants, [[Oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical|petrochemical plants]], [[Geothermal power|geothermal]], [[biomass]] and [[trash-to-energy plant|waste-to-energy plants]] use [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]] to provide air movement upward through downcoming water, and are not hyperboloid chimney-like structures. The induced or forced-draft cooling towers are typically rectangular, box-like structures filled with a material that enhances the mixing of the upflowing air and the downflowing water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://spxcooling.com/en/library/detail/cooling-tower-fundamentals/|author=J.C. Hensley (Editor)|title=Cooling Tower Fundamentals|edition=2nd|publisher=SPX Cooling Technologies|year=2006|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] |edition=4th | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year=1967|id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]}} (Includes cooling tower material balance for evaporation emissions and blowdown effluents. Available in many university libraries)&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas with restricted water use, a dry cooling tower or directly air-cooled radiators may be necessary, since the cost or environmental consequences of obtaining make-up water for evaporative cooling would be prohibitive. These coolers have lower efficiency and higher energy consumption to drive fans, compared to a typical wet, evaporative cooling tower.

===Once-through cooling systems===
Electric companies often prefer to use cooling water from the ocean, a lake, or a river, or a cooling pond, instead of a cooling tower. This single pass or [[once-through cooling]] system can save the cost of a cooling tower and may have lower energy costs for pumping cooling water through the plant's [[heat exchanger]]s. However, the waste heat can cause [[thermal pollution]] as the water is discharged. Power plants using natural bodies of water for cooling are designed with mechanisms such as [[fish screen]]s, to limit intake of organisms into the cooling machinery. These screens are only partially effective and as a result billions of fish and other aquatic organisms are killed by power plants each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Riverkeeper, Inc. v. U.S. EPA |vol=358 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=174 |pinpoint=181 |court=2d Cir. |date=2004 |url=http://openjurist.org/358/f3d/174/riverkeeper-inc-llc-v-united-states-environmental-protection-agency |accessdate=2015-08-22 |quote=A single power plant might impinge a million adult fish in just a three-week period, or entrain some 3 to 4 billion smaller fish and shellfish in a year, destabilizing wildlife populations in the surrounding ecosystem.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC (May 2014).

Document no. EPA-821-F-14-001.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the cooling system at the [[Indian Point Energy Center]] in New York kills over a billion fish eggs and larvae annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McGeehan |first=Patrick |date=2015-05-12 |title=Fire Prompts Renewed Calls to Close the Indian Point Nuclear Plant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/nyregion/fire-prompts-renewed-calls-to-close-the-indian-point-nuclear-plant.html |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further environmental impact is that aquatic organisms which adapt to the warmer discharge water may be injured if the plant shuts down in cold weather.

Water consumption by power stations is a developing issue.&lt;ref&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science. AAAS Annual Meeting 17 - 21 Feb 2011, Washington DC. "Sustainable or Not? Impacts and Uncertainties of Low-Carbon Energy Technologies on Water." Dr Evangelos Tzimas, European Commission, JRC Institute for Energy, Petten, Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, recycled wastewater, or [[greywater|grey water]], has been used in cooling towers. The Calpine Riverside and the Calpine Fox power stations in [[Wisconsin]] as well as the Calpine Mankato power station in [[Minnesota]] are among these facilities.

==Power from renewable energy==
Power stations can also generate electrical energy from [[renewable energy]] sources.

===Hydroelectric power station===
{{Main|Hydroelectricity}}
[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb|[[Three Gorges Dam]], [[Hubei]], [[China]]]]
In a hydroelectric power station water flows through turbines using [[hydropower]] to generate [[hydroelectricity]]. Power is captured from the gravitational force of water falling through [[penstocks]] to [[water turbine]]s connected to [[electric generator|generators]]. The amount of power available is a combination of height and flow. A wide range of [[Dam]]s may be built to raise the water level, and create a lake for [[reservoir|storing water]].
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. [[China]] is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use.

===Solar===
{{Main|Solar power}}
[[File:Giant photovoltaic array.jpg|thumb|[[Nellis Solar Power Plant]] in [[Nevada]], United States]]

[[Solar energy]] can be turned into electricity either directly in [[solar cell]]s, or in a [[concentrating solar power]] plant by focusing the light to run a heat engine.

A solar photovoltaic power plant converts sunlight into direct current electricity using the [[photoelectric effect]]. [[Power inverter|Inverters]] change the direct current into alternating current for connection to the electrical grid. This type of plant does not use rotating machines for energy conversion.

Solar thermal power plants are another type of solar power plant. They use either parabolic troughs or [[heliostat]]s to direct sunlight onto a pipe containing a heat transfer fluid, such as oil. The heated oil is then used to boil water into steam, which turns a turbine that drives an electrical generator. The central tower type of solar thermal power plant uses hundreds or thousands of mirrors, depending on size, to direct sunlight onto a receiver on top of a tower. Again, the heat is used to produce steam to turn turbines that drive electrical generators.

===Wind===
{{Main|Wind power}}
[[File:GreenMountainWindFarm Fluvanna 2004.jpg|thumb|Wind turbines in [[Texas]], [[United States]]]]

[[Wind turbine]]s can be used to generate electricity in areas with strong, steady winds, sometimes [[Shore|offshore]]. Many different designs have been used in the past, but almost all modern turbines being produced today use a three-bladed, upwind design. Grid-connected wind turbines now being built are much larger than the units installed during the 1970s. They thus produce power more cheaply and reliably than earlier models. With larger turbines (on the order of one megawatt), the blades move more slowly than older, smaller, units, which makes them less visually distracting and safer for birds.

===Marine===
{{Main|Marine energy}}
'''Marine energy''' or '''marine power''' (also sometimes referred to as '''ocean energy''' or '''ocean power''') refers to the energy carried by [[ocean wave]]s, [[tide]]s, [[salinity]], and [[ocean thermal energy|ocean temperature differences]]. The movement of water in the world’s oceans creates a vast store of [[kinetic energy]], or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to [[electricity generation|generate]] electricity to power homes, transport and industries.

The term marine energy encompasses both [[wave power]] — power from surface waves, and [[tidal power]] — obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. [[Offshore wind power]] is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the [[wind]], even if the [[wind turbine]]s are placed over water.

The [[ocean]]s have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new [[renewable energy]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Trust, ''Future Marine Energy. Results of the Marine Energy Challenge: Cost competitiveness and growth of wave and tidal stream energy'', January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osmosis===
[[File:Hurum osmosis power 02.JPG|thumb|Osmotic Power Prototype at Tofte (Hurum), Norway]]
{{Main|Osmotic power}}
Salinity gradient energy is called pressure-retarded osmosis. In this method, seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water. Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane, which increases both the volume and pressure of the chamber. As the pressure differences are compensated, a turbine is spun creating energy. This method is being specifically studied by the Norwegian utility Statkraft, which has calculated that up to 25 TWh/yr would be available from this process in Norway. Statkraft has built the world's first prototype osmotic power plant on the Oslo fiord which was opened on November 24, 2009.

===Biomass===
[[File:Metz biomass power station.jpg|thumb|Metz biomass power station]]
[[Biomass]] energy can be produced from combustion of waste green material to heat water into steam and drive a steam turbine. Bioenergy can also be processed through a range of temperatures and pressures in [[gasification]], [[pyrolysis]] or [[torrefaction]] reactions. Depending on the desired end product, these reactions create more energy-dense products ([[syngas]], [[wood pellets]], [[Torrefaction|biocoal]]) that can then be fed into an accompanying engine to produce electricity at a much lower emission rate when compared with open burning.

==Storage power stations==
{{Main|Energy storage}}
It is possible to store energy and produce the electricity at a later time like in [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], [[Thermal energy storage]], [[Flywheel energy storage]], [[Battery storage power station]] and so on.

===Pumped storage===
{{main|Pumped-storage hydroelectricity}}

The worlds largest form of storage for excess electricity, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] is a reversible hydroelectric plant. They are a net consumer of energy but provide storage for any source of electricity, effectively smoothing peaks and troughs in electricity supply and demand. Pumped storage plants typically use "spare" electricity during off peak periods to pump water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir. Because the pumping takes place "off peak", electricity is less valuable than at peak times. This less valuable "spare" electricity comes from uncontrolled wind power and [[base load]] power plants such as coal, nuclear and geothermal, which still produce power at night even though demand is very low. During daytime peak demand, when electricity prices are high, the storage is used for [[Peaking power plant|peaking power]], where water in the upper reservoir is allowed to flow back to a lower reservoir through a turbine and generator. Unlike coal power stations, which can take more than 12 hours to start up from cold, a hydroelectric generator can be brought into service in a few minutes, ideal to meet a peak load demand. Two substantial pumped storage schemes are in South Africa, [[Palmiet Pumped Storage Scheme]] and another in the Drakensberg, [[Ingula Pumped Storage Scheme]].

==Typical power output==
{{See also|List of largest power stations}}
{{update section|date=June 2016|reason="As of 2011", "As of April 2012" are out of date}} 
The power generated by a power station is measured in multiples of the [[watt]], typically [[mega-|megawatts]] (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; watts) or [[Giga-|gigawatts]] (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; watts). Power stations vary greatly in capacity depending on the type of power plant and on historical, geographical and economic factors. The following examples offer a sense of the scale.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the USA. As of 2011, the [[Roscoe Wind Farm]] is the second largest onshore wind farm in the world, producing 781.5 [[Megawatt|MW]] of power, followed by the [[Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center]] (735.5 MW). As of July 2013, the  [[London Array]] in [[United Kingdom]] is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 630 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by [[Thanet Offshore Wind Project]] in [[United Kingdom]] at 300 [[Megawatt|MW]].

{{As of|2015}}, the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|largest photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the world]] are led by [[Longyangxia Dam]] Solar Park in China, rated at 850 megawatts.

Solar thermal power stations in the U.S. have the following output:
:The country's largest solar facility at [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|Kramer Junction]] has an output of 354 MW
:The [[Blythe Solar Power Project]] planned production is estimated at 485 MW

[[File:Koebergnps.jpg|thumb|The [[Koeberg Nuclear Power Station]], South Africa]]
Large coal-fired, nuclear, and hydroelectric power stations can generate hundreds of megawatts to multiple gigawatts. Some examples:
:The [[Koeberg Nuclear Power Station]] in South Africa has a rated capacity of 1860 megawatts. 
:The coal-fired [[Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station]] in the UK has a rated capacity of 2 gigawatts.
:The [[Aswan Dam]] hydro-electric plant in Egypt has a capacity of 2.1 gigawatts.
:The [[Three Gorges Dam]] hydro-electric plant in China has a capacity of 22.5 gigawatts.

Gas turbine power plants can generate tens to hundreds of megawatts. Some examples:
:The [[Indian Queens]] simple-cycle, or open cycle gas turbine (OCGT), peaking power station in Cornwall UK, with a single gas turbine is rated 140 megawatts.
:The [[Medway Power Station]], a combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station in Kent, UK with two gas turbines and one steam turbine, is rated 700 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industcards.com/cc-england-south.htm CCGT Plants in South England] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, by Power Plants Around the World&lt;/ref&gt;

The rated capacity of a power station is nearly the maximum electrical power that that power station can produce.
Some power plants are run at almost exactly their rated capacity all the time, as a non-load-following [[base load power plant]], except at times of scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.

However, many power plants usually produce much less power than their rated capacity.

In some cases a power plant produces much less power than its rated capacity because it uses an [[intermittent energy source]].
Operators try to pull [[maximum power point tracker|maximum available power]] from such power plants, because their [[marginal cost]] is practically zero, but the available power varies widely—in particular, it may be zero during heavy storms at night.

In some cases operators deliberately produce less power for economic reasons.
The cost of fuel to run a [[load following power plant]] may be relatively high, and the cost of fuel to run a [[peaking power plant]] is even higher—they have relatively high marginal costs.
Operators keep power plants turned off ("operational reserve") or running at minimum fuel consumption{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} ("spinning reserve") most of the time.
Operators feed more fuel into load following power plants only when the demand rises above what lower-cost plants (i.e., intermittent and base load plants) can produce, and then feed more fuel into peaking power plants only when the demand rises faster than the load following power plants can follow.

==Operations==
[[File:Power plant control room.jpg|thumb|Control room of a power plant]]

Operating staff at a power station have several duties. Operators are responsible for the safety of the work crews that frequently do repairs on the mechanical and electrical equipment. They maintain the equipment with periodic [[inspection]]s and log temperatures, pressures and other important information at regular intervals. Operators are responsible for starting and stopping the [[Electrical generator|generators]] depending on need. They are able to synchronize and adjust the voltage output of the added generation with the running electrical system, without upsetting the system. They must know the electrical and mechanical systems to [[troubleshoot]] problems in the facility and add to the reliability of the facility. Operators must be able to respond to an emergency and know the procedures in place to deal with it.

'''Predictive Control of Switching Power Converters'''.  Predictive controllers rely on optimum control systems theory and aim to solve a cost functional minimization problem.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, W. S. ed. The Control Handbook, CRC/IEEE Press, Boca Raton, USA, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Athans, Lecture Notes on Design of Robust Multivariable Feedback Control System, Prof. of Electrical Engineering, MIT, Visiting Research Emeritus Prof ISR/IST, Lisboa, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Predictive controllers are relatively easy to numerically implement but electronic [[power converter]]s are non-linear time varying dynamic systems, so a different approach to predictive must be taken.

==Principles of non-linear predictive optimum control==
The first step to design a predictive controller is to derive a detailed direct dynamic model (including non-linearities) of the switching power converter. This model must contain enough detail of the converter dynamics to allow, from initial conditions, a forecast in real time and with negligible error, of the future behavior of the converter.

Sliding mode control of switching power converters chooses a vector to reach sliding mode as fast as possible (high switching frequency).

It would be better to choose a vector to ensure zero error at the end of the sampling period Δt.

To find such a vector, a previous calculation can be made (prediction);

The converter has a finite number of vectors (states) and is usually non-linear: one way is to try all vectors to find the one that minimizes the control errors, prior to the application of that vector to the converter.

==Direct dynamics model based predictive control (DDMBPC)==
[[File:DD predictive flowchart.JPG|thumb|Direct Dynamics Predictive Control of Switching Power Converters]]
Receding Horizon Optimum Predictive Control

===The algorithm===
#  Obtain a dynamic model of the converter. Example:
#  Define a quadratic cost functional Jj (Δt, Usαβj)  and its weights ρiα , ρiβ , ρuPWM
# Sample control variables and selected disturbances at sampling time ts
# Use a prediction equation, from the direct dynamics, to predict the value of the control variables in the next sampling time (ts+Δt) for all converter vectors Usαβj
#  For each vector, calculate the cost function Jj(Δt, Usαβj) and determine its minimum:
#  Apply the new vector, advance to the next sampling time (return to step 3).

==Inverse dynamics optimum predictive control (IDOPC)==
[[File:ID predictive flowchart.JPG|thumb|Inverse Dynamics Predictive Control of Switching Power Converters]]

===Fast optimum predictive algorithm===
#  Obtain a dynamic model of the converter
# Sample control variables and selected disturbances at sampling interval Δt
#  The control objective should be attained at sampling time t+Δt, then it+Δt = iref. Use the Euler-backward method to obtain:
# Use a prediction equation from the INVERSE DYNAMICS to predict the value of the OPTIMUM CONTROL VECTOR Usαβ t+Δt in the next sampling time (t+Δt)
#  Calculate and minimize a cost function that evaluates the “distance” between the OPTIMUM VECTOR Usαβ t+Δt and all the available converter vectors Usαβj
# Apply the new vector, advance to the next sampling time (return to step 3).

'''Psychrophiles''' or '''cryophiles''' (adj. psychrophilic or cryophilic) are [[Extremophile|extremophilic]] [[organism]]s that are capable of [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[Biological reproduction|reproduction]] in low temperatures, ranging from −200&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;!--CONFLICT with stmt in body--&gt;&lt;ref name="NeufeldClarke20132"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neufeld |first1=Josh |last2=Clarke |first2=Andrew |last3=Morris |first3=G. John |last4=Fonseca |first4=Fernanda |last5=Murray |first5=Benjamin J. |last6=Acton |first6=Elizabeth |last7=Price |first7=Hannah C. |year=2013 |title=A Low Temperature Limit for Life on Earth |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=6 |page=e66207 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066207|pmid=23840425 |pmc=3686811 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...866207C }}&lt;/ref&gt; to +10&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;!--CONFLICT with stmt in body--&gt; They are found in places that are permanently cold, such as the polar regions and the deep sea. They can be contrasted with [[thermophile]]s, which are organisms that thrive at unusually high temperatures. Psychrophile is Greek for 'cold-loving'.

Many such organisms are [[bacteria]] or [[archaea]], but some [[eukaryote]]s such as [[lichen]]s, [[snow algae]], fungi, and [[Chironomidae|wingless midges]], are also classified as psychrophiles.

==Biology==
[[File:Xanthoria elegans 97571 wb1.jpg|thumb|The [[lichen]] ''[[Xanthoria elegans]]'' can continue to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] at −24&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="BartákVáczi2007"/&gt;]]

===Habitat===
The cold environments that psychrophiles inhabit are ubiquitous on Earth, as a large fraction of our planetary surface experiences temperatures lower than 15&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;!--CONFLICT with stmt in lead--&gt; They are present in [[permafrost]], polar ice, [[glacier]]s, [[snow field|snowfields]] and [[deep ocean]] waters. These organisms can also be found in pockets of sea ice with high salinity content.&lt;ref name="D'amico, Salvino 20063" /&gt; Microbial activity has been measured in [[soil]]s frozen below −39&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;!--CONFLICT with stmt in lead--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.07.004 |title=Microbial activity in soils frozen to below −39°C |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=785–794 |year=2006 |last1=Panikov |first1=N.S. |last2=Flanagan |first2=P.W. |last3=Oechel |first3=W.C. |last4=Mastepanov |first4=M.A. |last5=Christensen |first5=T.R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their temperature limit, psychrophiles must also adapt to other extreme environmental constraints that may arise as a result of their habitat. These constraints include high pressure in the deep sea, and high salt concentration on some sea ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Feller |first1=Georges |last2=Gerday |first2=Charles |date=December 2003 |title=Psychrophilic enzymes: hot topics in cold adaptation |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=200–208 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro773|pmid=15035024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D'amico, Salvino 20063"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D'Amico, Salvino |author2=Tony Collins |author3=Jean-Claude Marx |author4=Georges Feller |author5=Charles Gerday |year=2006 |title=Psychrophilic Microorganisms: Challenges for Life |journal=EMBO Rep EMBO Reports |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=385–9 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400662 |pmc=1456908 |pmid=16585939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations===

Psychrophiles are protected from freezing and the expansion of ice by ice-induced [[desiccation]] and [[vitrification]] (glass transition), as long as they cool slowly. Free living cells desiccate and vitrify between −10&amp;nbsp;°C and −26&amp;nbsp;°C. Cells of multicellular organisms may vitrify at temperatures below −50&amp;nbsp;°C. The cells may continue to have some metabolic activity in the extracellular fluid down to these temperatures, and they remain viable once restored to normal temperatures.&lt;ref name="NeufeldClarke20132"/&gt;

They must also overcome the stiffening of their lipid cell membrane, as this is important for the survival and functionality of these organisms. To accomplish this, psychrophiles adapt lipid membrane structures that have a high content of short, [[unsaturated fatty acids]]. Compared to longer saturated fatty acids, incorporating this type of fatty acid allows for the lipid cell membrane to have a lower melting point, which increases the fluidity of the membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/bf02705110 |title=A branched chain fatty acid promotes cold adaptation in bacteria |journal=Journal of Biosciences |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=363–364 |year=2003 |last1=Chattopadhyay |first1=M. K. |last2=Jagannadham |first2=M. V. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[carotenoid]]s are present in the membrane, which help modulate the fluidity of it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/bf02705244 |title=Mechanism of bacterial adaptation to low temperature |journal=Journal of Biosciences |volume=31 |pages=157–165 |year=2006 |last1=Chattopadhyay |first1=M. K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antifreeze proteins]] are also synthesized to keep psychrophiles' internal space liquid, and to protect their [[DNA]] when temperatures drop below water's freezing point. By doing so, the protein prevents any ice formation or recrystallization process from occurring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The enzymes of these organisms have been hypothesized to engage in a activity-stability-flexibility relationship as a method for adapting to the cold; the flexibility of their enzyme structure will increase as a way to compensate for the freezing effect of their environment.&lt;ref name="D'amico, Salvino 20063"/&gt;

Certain cryophiles, such as Gram-negative bacteria ''Vibrio'' and ''Aeromonas'' spp., can transition into a [[viable but nonculturable (VBNC)]] state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maayer|first=Pieter De|last2=Anderson|first2=Dominique|last3=Cary|first3=Craig|last4=Cowan|first4=Don A.|date=May 15, 2015|title=Some like it cold: understanding the survival strategies of psychrophiles|journal=EMBO Reports|volume=15|issue=5|pages=508–517|doi=10.1002/embr.201338170|pmc=4210084|pmid=24671034}}&lt;/ref&gt; During VBNC, a micro-organism can respirate and use substrates for metabolism – however, it cannot replicate. An advantage of this state is that it is highly reversible. It has been debated whether VBNC is an active survival strategy or if eventually the organism's cells will no longer be able to be revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2014.00258 |pmid=24917854 |pmc=4040921 |title=The importance of the viable but non-culturable state in human bacterial pathogens |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |volume=5 |pages=258 |year=2014 |last1=Li |first1=Laam |last2=Mendis |first2=Nilmini |last3=Trigui |first3=Hana |last4=Oliver |first4=James D. |last5=Faucher |first5=Sebastien P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is proof however it may be very effective –  Gram positive bacteria Actinobacteria have been shown to have lived about 500,000 years in the permafrost conditions of Antarctica, Canada, and Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0706787104 |pmid=17728401 |pmc=1958816 |bibcode=2007PNAS..10414401J |title=Ancient bacteria show evidence of DNA repair |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=36 |pages=14401–5 |last1=Johnson |first1=Sarah Stewart |last2=Hebsgaard |first2=Martin B. |last3=Christensen |first3=Torben R. |last4=Mastepanov |first4=Mikhail |last5=Nielsen |first5=Rasmus |last6=Munch |first6=Kasper |last7=Brand |first7=Tina |last8=Gilbert |first8=M.

Psychrophiles include bacteria, lichens, fungi, and insects.

Among the bacteria that can tolerate extreme cold are ''[[Arthrobacter]]'' sp., ''[[Psychrobacter]]'' sp. and members of the genera ''[[Halomonas]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Hyphomonas]]'', and ''[[Sphingomonas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-earth-040610-133514 |bibcode=2013AREPS..41...87S |title=Psychrophiles |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=41 |pages=87–115 |last1=Siddiqui |first1=Khawar S. |last2=Williams |first2=Timothy J. |last3=Wilkins |first3=David |last4=Yau |first4=Sheree |last5=Allen |first5=Michelle A. |last6=Brown |first6=Mark V. |last7=Lauro |first7=Federico M. |last8=Cavicchioli |first8=Ricardo |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is ''[[Chryseobacterium greenlandensis]]'', a psychrophile that was found in 120,000-year-old ice.

''[[Umbilicaria antarctica]]'' and ''[[Xanthoria elegans]]'' are lichens that have been recorded photosynthesizing at temperatures ranging down to −24&amp;nbsp;°C, and they can grow down to around −10&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1473550413000438 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..141C |title=The thermal limits to life on Earth |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=141–154 |last1=Clarke |first1=Andrew |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BartákVáczi2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barták |first1=Miloš |last2=Váczi |first2=Peter |last3=Hájek |first3=Josef |last4=Smykla |first4=Jerzy |title=Low-temperature limitation of primary photosynthetic processes in Antarctic lichens Umbilicaria antarctica and Xanthoria elegans |journal=Polar Biology |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2007 |pages=47–51  |doi=10.1007/s00300-007-0331-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some multicellular eukaryotes can also be metabolically active at sub-zero temperatures, such as some conifers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Les résineux - Tome 1 : connaissance et reconnaissance |author=Riou-Nivert, Philippe |publisher=Institut pour le développement forestier |year=2001 |p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; those in the ''[[Chironomidae]]'' family are still active at −16&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/310225a0 |bibcode=1984Natur.310..225K |title=A novel cold-tolerant insect found in a Himalayan glacier |journal=Nature |volume=310 |issue=5974 |pages=225–227 |last1=Kohshima |first1=Shiro |year=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Penicillium]]'' is a genus of fungi found in a wide range of environments including extreme cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5958/2230-732x.2014.00258.7 |title=Extremophiles: An Overview of Microorganism from Extreme Environment |journal=International Journal of Agriculture, Environment and Biotechnology |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=371 |year=2014 |last1=Gupta |first1=G.N. |last2=Srivastava |first2=S. |last3=Khare |first3=S.K. |last4=Prakash |first4=V. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are responsible for spoiling [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] foods.

Psychrotrophic bacteria are of particular concern to the [[dairy industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonthemilkman.com/2006/03/18/the-case-of-psychrotrophic-bacteria/ |title=The case of Psychrotrophic bacteria |publisher=Leon the Milkman's Blog |date=2006-03-18 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}{{self-published inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are killed by [[pasteurization]]; however, they can be present in milk as post-pasteurization contaminants due to less than adequate sanitation practices. According to the Food Science Department at [[Cornell university|Cornell University]], psychrotrophs are bacteria capable of growth at temperatures at or less than {{convert |7 |C |sigfig=3}}. At freezing temperatures, growth of psychrotrophic bacteria becomes negligible or virtually stops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100623132829/http://foodscience.cornell.edu/cals/foodsci/extension/upload/Bact-Milk-Shelf-Life-Doc.doc Steven C.

All three subunits of the RecBCD enzyme are essential for physiological activities of the enzyme in the Antarctic ''[[Pseudomonas syringae]]'', namely, repairing of DNA damage and supporting the growth at low temperature. The RecBCD enzymes are exchangeable between the psychrophilic ''P. syringae'' and the mesophilic ''E. coli'' when provided with the entire protein complex from same species. However, the RecBC proteins (RecBCPs and RecBCEc) of the two bacteria are not equivalent; the RecBCEc is proficient in DNA recombination and repair, and supports the growth of ''P. syringae'' at low temperature, while RecBCPs is insufficient for these functions. Finally, both helicase and nuclease activity of the RecBCDPs are although important for DNA repair and growth of ''P. syringae'' at low temperature, the RecB-nuclease activity is not essential in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009412 |pmid=20195537 |pmc=2828478 |bibcode=2010PLoSO...5.9412P |title=All Three Subunits of RecBCD Enzyme Are Essential for DNA Repair and Low-Temperature Growth in the Antarctic Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e9412 |last1=Pavankumar |first1=Theetha L. |last2=Sinha |first2=Anurag K. |last3=Ray |first3=Malay K. |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus psychrotroph==

In 1940, ZoBell and Conn stated that they had never encountered "true psychrophiles" or organisms that grow best at relatively low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ingraham, J. L. |title=Growth of psychrophilic bacteria |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=75–80 |year=1958 |pmc=290156 |pmid=13563393}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, J. L. Ingraham supported this by concluding that there are very few or possibly no bacteria that fit the textbook definitions of psychrophiles. Richard Y. Morita emphasizes this by using the term ''psychrotroph'' to describe organisms that do not meet the definition of psychrophiles. The confusion between the terms ''psychrotrophs'' and ''psychrophiles'' was started because investigators were unaware of the thermolability of psychrophilic organisms at the laboratory temperatures. Due to this, early investigators did not determine the cardinal temperatures for their isolates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morita, Richard Y. |title=Psychrophilic bacteria |journal=Bacteriological Reviews |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=144–67 |year=1975 |pmc=413900 |pmid=1095004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity between these two is that they are both capable of growing at zero, but optimum and upper temperature limits for the growth are lower for psychrophiles compared to psychrotrophs.&lt;ref name="Russell, N. J. 1237"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Russell, N. J. |author2=P. Harrisson |author3=I. A. Johnston |author4= R. Jaenicke |author5= M. Zuber |author6=F. Franks |author7=D.

Although psychrophilic enzymes remain under-used because the cost of production and processing at low temperatures is higher than for the commercial enzymes that are presently in use, the attention and resurgence of research interest in psychrophiles and psychrotrophs will be a contributor to the betterment of the environment and the desire to conserve energy.&lt;ref name="Russell, N.

Smith, 2005: ''The Natural Advantage of Nations: Business Opportunities, Innovation and Governance in the 21st Century''.

[http://esl.jrc.it/dc/etr/ecological_tax_reform.htm#_Toc109534444]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be expressed in monetary terms as the monetary yield per unit resource.

For example, when applied to [[crop]] [[irrigation]] it is the yield of crop obtained through use of a given volume of irrigation [[water]], the “crop per drop”, which could also be expressed as monetary return from product per use of unit irrigation water.

Resource productivity and [[resource intensity]] are key concepts used in [[sustainability measurement]] as they attempt to decouple the direct connection between resource use and [[environmental degradation]]. Their strength is that they can be used as a metric for both [[economic cost|economic]] and [[environmental cost]]. Although these concepts are two sides of the same coin, in practice they involve very different approaches and can be viewed as reflecting, on the one hand, the efficiency of resource production as outcome per unit of resource use (resource productivity) and, on the other hand, the efficiency of [[resource consumption]] as resource use per unit outcome (resource intensity). The sustainability objective is to maximize resource productivity while minimizing resource intensity. Scientific and political debates on resource productivity are regularly held at, among others, the [[World Resources Forum]] conferences.

'''Saturate, Aromatic, Resin and Asphaltene''' (SARA) is an analysis method that divides [[crude oil]] components according to their polarizability and polarity.   The saturate fraction consists of nonpolar material including linear, branched, and cyclic saturated hydrocarbons ([[Alkane|paraffins]]). [[Aromatics]], which contain one or more aromatic rings, are slightly more polarizable. The remaining two fractions, resins and [[asphaltenes]], have polar substituents. The distinction between the two is that asphaltenes are insoluble in an excess of heptane (or pentane) whereas resins are miscible with heptane (or pentane).

==Method description==
There are three main methods to obtain SARA results.  One has lately emerged as the most popular. That technology is known as the [[Iatroscan TLC-FID]], it combines TLC with [[flame ionization detection]] (TLC-FID).  It is referred to as IP-143.  Other analysis giving SARA numbers might not correspond to the numbers obtained in IP-143.  It is therefore always important to know the analysis method when comparing SARA numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Tianguang Fan, et al. (2002). "Evaluating Crude Oils by SARA Analysis" Society of Petroleum Engineers, Proceeding of SPE/DOE Improved Oil Recovery Symposium, 13–17 April 2002, Tulsa, Oklahoma&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the only method that is 100 times more sensitive than any old method and faster. Takes&lt;ref&gt;shell-usa.com&lt;/ref&gt; 30 seconds for 1 sample instead of 1 day.

'''''Shòu''''' ({{zh|s=寿|t=壽|p={{audio|Zh-shòu.ogg|shòu|help=no}}}}) is the Chinese word/character for "longevity".

== Use ==
Three of the most important goals in life in Chinese traditional thought are the propitious blessings of happiness (''fú'' 福), professional success or prosperity (''lù'' 禄), and longevity (''shòu'' 寿). These are visually represented by the three "star gods" of the same names ([[Fu Lu Shou|''Fú, Lù, Shòu'']]), commonly depicted as three male figurines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duda |first=Margaret |title=Traditional Chinese  Toggles |publisher=EDM |year=2011 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; (each wearing a distinctive garment and holding an object that enables them to be differentiated), or the Chinese ideographs/characters themselves, or various homophones or objects with relevant attributes. ''Shòu'' is instantly recognizable. "He holds in his hand a large peach, and attached to his long staff are a gourd and a scroll. The stag and the bat both indicate ''fu'' happiness. The peach, gourd, and scroll are symbols of longevity."&lt;ref name=werner431&gt;{{cite book |last=Werner |first=E. T. C. |title=A Dictionary of Chinese Mythology |publisher=Kelly and Walsh |year=1932 |page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most striking characteristic is, however, his large and high forehead, which earned him the title "Longevity Star Old-pate".&lt;ref name=werner431 /&gt;

The Chinese character ''shòu'' (寿) is usually found on textiles, furniture, ceramics and jewelry, generally in its more complex ideograph (壽), but also in its simplified (post-1950) form (寿). The ideograph may appear alone or be surrounded by flowers, bats, or other good luck symbols, but will always hold a central position. 

Longevity is commonly recognized as one of the Five Blessings (''wǔfú'' 五福 - longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, a peaceful death) of Chinese belief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Terese Tse |title=Hidden Meanings in Chinese Art |publisher=Asian Art Museum of San Francisco |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are often depicted in the [[homophone|homophonous]] rendition of five flying [[bat]]s because the word for "[[bat]]" in Chinese (''fú'' 蝠) sounds like the word for [[Fu character|"good fortune" or "happiness"]] or in this case, "blessings".&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In this arrangement, the ''shòu'' ideograph sometimes takes the dominant central position, replacing the fifth bat.

Other symbols in Chinese iconography that represent longevity include [[Pine|pine trees]], [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], spotted deer, special collectors' stones (''shòushí'' 寿石), [[peach]]es, and [[tortoise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Duda, pp. 204-6&lt;/ref&gt; These are often depicted in small groupings to emphasize the central, symbolic meaning of the picture (for example, cranes standing amongst pine trees).  

Perhaps the most common Chinese auspicious saying concerning longevity is that found on scrolls in nearly every Chinese calligraphy shop in the world: ''shòu shān fú hǎi'' (寿山福海), which can be translated as "May your life be as steadfast as the mountains and your good fortune as limitless as the seas".

Since 2017, the version 10 of the [[Unicode]] Standard features a rounded version of the symbol in the "Enclosed Ideographic Supplement" block, at code point U+1F262 (ROUNDED SYMBOL FOR SHOU).&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 10.0, Enclosed Ideographic Supplement|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-10.0/U100-1F200.pdf|website=unicode.org|publisher=The Unicode Consortium|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In names===
As a sign for a resonant cultural concept, the character became a part of many Chinese names (e.g. [[Palace of Tranquil Longevity]] in Beijing). The Japanese equivalent is '''Kotobuki''' 寿 (see [[Nakajima Kotobuki]], [[Tsukasa Kotobuki]]). See also [[Jurōjin]] (Shou Laoren) and [[Fukurokuju]].

'''Water oxidation catalysis''' (WOC) is the acceleration (catalysis) of the conversion of water into oxygen and protons:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +  4 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Many catalysts are effective, both [[homogeneous catalyst]]s and [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s. The [[oxygen evolving complex]] in photosynthesis is the premier example. There is no interest in generating oxygen by water oxidation since oxygen is readily obtained from air.  Instead, interest in water oxidation is motivated by its relevance to [[water splitting]], which would provide "solar [[hydrogen]]," i.e. water oxidation would generate the electrons and protons for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name=TJM/&gt; An ideal WOC would operate rapidly at low overpotential, exhibit high stability and be of low cost, derived from nontoxic components.

==Mechanistic and energetic principles==
Water is more difficult to oxidize than its conjugate base [[hydroxide]].  Hydroxide is stabilized by coordination to metal cations.  Some metal hydroxides, those featuring redox-active metal centers, can oxidize to give [[metal oxo complex]]es.  Attack of water on metal oxo centers represents one pathway for the formation of the O-O bond, leading to dioxygen.  Alternatively, the crutial O-O bond forming step can arise by coupling suitably positioned pairs of metal hydroxo centers.  The molecular mechanism of the OEC has not been elucidated.

The conversion of even metal hydroxo complexes to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires very strong oxidants.  In photosynthesis, such oxidants are provided by electron holes on porphyrin radical cations.  For device applications, the aspirational oxidant is a [[photovoltaic]] material.  For screening WOCs, [[ceric ammonium nitrate]] is a typical electron acceptor.

The intermediate formed reacts with water to liberate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The cobalt-[[polyoxometalate]] complex [Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(α-PW&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;10−&lt;/sup&gt; is highly efficient WOC.&lt;ref&gt;Yin, Q.; Tan, J.

Science 2010, 328, 342-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some iron complexes catalyze water oxidation. A water-soluble complex [Fe(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pytacn)] (Pytacn=pyridine-substituted [[trimethyltriazacyclononane]]; OTf= [[triflate]]) is an efficient WOC. The concentration of the catalyst and the oxidant were found to be strongly affecting the oxidation process. Many related complexes with cis labile sites are active catalysts.  Most complexes were found to undergo degradation in a few hours.  The number and stereochemistry of reactive coordination sites on Fe have been evaluated but few guidelines have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Fillol, J. L.; Codolà, Z.; Garcia-Bosch, I.; Gómez, L.; Pla, J. J.; Costas, M., Efficient water oxidation catalysts based on readily available iron coordination complexes. Nat Chem 2011, 3, 807-813.&lt;/ref&gt;

Replacing ppy with Cp* (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) results in increased catalytic activity but decreased the turnover number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hull, J.

'''Weight gain''' is an increase in [[body weight]]. This can involve an increase in [[muscle mass]], [[Fat deposition|fat deposits]], excess fluids such as [[water]] or other factors. Weight gain can be a symptom of a serious medical condition.

== Description ==
If enough weight is gained due to increased body fat deposits, one may become [[overweight]] or [[obese]], generally defined as having more body fat ([[adipose tissue]]) than is considered good for [[health]]. The Body Mass Index (BMI) measures body weight in proportion to the square of height and defines optimal, insufficient, and excessive weight based on the ratio.

Weight gain has a latency period.  The effect that eating has on weight gain can vary greatly depending on the following factors:  [[Specific energy#Energy density of food|energy (calorie) density]] of foods, exercise regimen, amount of water intake, amount of salt contained in the food, time of day eaten, age of individual, individual's country of origin, individual's overall stress level, and amount of water retention in ankles/feet.  Typical latency periods vary from three days to two weeks after ingestion.

Having excess [[adipose tissue]] (fat) is a common condition, especially where food supplies are plentiful and [[sedentary lifestyle|lifestyles are sedentary]]. As much as 64% of the [[United States]] adult population is considered either overweight or [[obese]], and this percentage has increased over the last four decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Katherine M. Flegal |author2=Margaret D. Carroll, MS |author3=Cynthia L. Ogden |author4=Clifford L. Johnson, MSPH | title=Prevalence and Trends in Obesity Among US Adults, 1999–2000 | journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] | year=2002 | volume=288 | issue=14 | pages=1723–1727 | url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/288/14/1723  | pmid=12365955 | doi=10.1001/jama.288.14.1723}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly asserted "rule" for weight gain or loss is based on the assumption that one pound of human fat tissue contains about 3,500 kilocalories (often simply called ''calories'' in the field of nutrition).&lt;ref name=Wishnofsky&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wishnofsky|first1=M|title=Caloric equivalents of gained or lost weight|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|date=1958|volume=6|pages=542–546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, eating 500 fewer calories than one needs per day should result in a loss of about a pound per week. Similarly, for every 3500 calories consumed above the amount one needs, a pound will be gained.&lt;ref name=Hall1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Kevin|last2=Chow|first2=CC|title=Why is the 3500 kcal per pound weight loss rule wrong?|journal=International Journal of Obesity|date=June 18, 2013|doi=10.1038/ijo.2013.112|volume=37|pages=1614|pmc=3859816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hall2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Kevin|last2=Sacks|first2=Gary|last3=Chandramohan|first3=Dhruva|last4=Chow|first4=Carson|last5=Wang|first5=Y Claire|last6=Gortmaker|first6=Steven|last7=Swinburn|first7=Boyd|title=Quantification of the effect of energy imbalance on bodyweight|journal=Lancet|volume=378|pages=826–37|url=http://nccor.org/annualreport2013/downloads/Obesity-3.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2016|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(11)60812-x|pmid=21872751|pmc=3880593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption that a pound of human fat tissue represents about 3500 calories in the context of weight loss or gain is based on a review of previous observations and experiments by Max Wishnofsky published in 1958. He notes that previous research suggested that a pound of human adipose tissue is 87% fat, which equals 395 grams of fat. He further assumes that animal fat contains 9.5 calories per gram. Thus one pound of human fat tissue should contain 3750 calories. He then critically analyzes the relevant literature and applies a number of additional assumptions, including that the diet contains sufficient protein and that the person is in glycogen and nitrogen (protein) equilibrium, leading to most weight loss stemming from the catabolism of fat. He concludes that a 3500 calorie excess or deficit for a person meeting his assumptions, would lead to the gain or loss, respectively, of one pound of body weight. He notes that if the assumptions he makes are not met, a deficit of 3500 calories would not necessarily equate to a pound of weight loss.

In any case, Wishnofsky did not take into account numerous aspects of human physiology and biochemistry which refute this simple equivalence. Unfortunately, the claim has achieved the status of a rule of thumb and is repeated in numerous sources, used for diet planning by dietitians and misapplied at the population level as well.&lt;ref name=Hall1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hall2 /&gt;

In regard to [[adipose tissue]] increases, a person generally gains weight by increasing food [[ingestion|consumption]], becoming [[Sedentary lifestyle|physically inactive]], or both.  When energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (when the body is in positive energy balance), the body can store the excess energy as fat. However, the physiology of weight gain and loss is complex involving numerous hormones, body systems and environmental factors. Other factors beside energy balance that may contribute to gaining weight include:

=== Social factors ===
A study, involving more than 12,000 people tracked over 32 years, found that social networks play a surprisingly powerful role in determining an individual's chances of gaining weight, transmitting an increased risk of becoming obese from wives to husbands, from brothers to brothers and from friends to friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The human microbiota facilitates fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids, SCFAs, contributing to weight gain.&lt;ref name="Arora, Tulika 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arora | first1 = Tulika | last2 = Sharma | first2 = Rajkumar | year = 2011 | title = Fermentation Potential Of The Gut Microbiome: Implications For Energy Homeostasis And Weight Management | url = | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 69 | issue = 2| pages = 99–106 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00365.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A change in the proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes may determine host’s risk of obesity.&lt;ref name="Arora, Tulika 2011"/&gt;

===Sleep and stress===
Lack of sufficient [[sleep]] has been suggested as a cause for weight gain or the difficulty in maintaining a healthy weight. Two hormones responsible for regulating hunger and metabolism are [[leptin]], which inhibits appetite and increases energy expenditure, and [[ghrelin]], which increases appetite and reduces energy expenditure. Studies have shown that chronic [[sleep deprivation]] is associated with reduced levels of leptin and elevated levels of ghrelin, which together result in [[increased appetite]], especially for high fat and high carbohydrate foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Patel |first=Sanjay R. |last2=Hu |first2=Frank B. |date=January 17, 2008 |title=Short sleep duration and weight gain: a systematic review |pmc=2723045 |journal=Obesity (Silver Spring) |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=643–653 |doi=10.1038/oby.2007.118 |pmid=18239586}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, sleep deprivation over time may contribute to increased caloric intake and decreased self-control over food cravings, leading to weight gain.

===Hormone and neurotransmitter imbalances===
Weight gain is a common side-effect of certain psychiatric medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Newcomer JW |title=Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics and metabolic effects: a comprehensive literature review |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=19 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=1–93 |year=2005 |pmid=15998156 |doi= 10.2165/00023210-200519001-00001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathologies===
Pathological causes of weight gain include [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[insulinoma]], and [[craniopharyngioma]]. Genetic reasons can relate to [[Prader–Willi syndrome]], [[Bardet–Biedl syndrome]], [[Alström syndrome]], [[Cohen syndrome]], and [[Carpenter syndrome]].

Medications that list headaches and/or fatigue as side effects can indirectly contribute to weight gain since they decrease the motivation for physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://esofosbuvir.com/harvoni-and-weight-gain/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Excess adipose tissue can lead to medical problems; however, a round or large figure does not necessarily imply a medical problem, and is sometimes not primarily caused by adipose tissue. If too much weight is gained, serious health side-effects may follow. A large number of medical conditions have been associated with obesity. Health consequences are categorised as being the result of either increased fat mass ([[osteoarthritis]], [[obstructive sleep apnea]], social stigma) or increased number of [[fat cells]] ([[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], some forms of [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]]).&lt;ref name=HaslamJames&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Haslam D, James WP |

== Social perspective ==
In centuries past, a degree of plumpness has been seen as indicative of personal or family prosperity: "Calories were scarce, physical labor was hard, and most people were as lean as greyhounds."&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Angier, "[http://www.foodmuseum.com/exfatCulture.html Who Is Fat? It Depends on Culture]." The History and Art of Being Fat. Accessed 2010.04.01.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the early 20th Century did fatness lose this appeal. The connection of fatness with financial well-being persists today in some less-developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safariweb.com/safarimate/trial2/fat.htm Fat Women: A Painter's Inspiration].  Accessed 2010.04.01.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, it may be on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Duval Smith, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/01/mauritania-force-feeding-marriage Girls being force-fed for marriage as fattening farms revived.]  ''The Observer'', Sunday 1 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the connotations that excess weight had in the past, it has for some time been seen as "unacceptable" in contemporary Western society. An expansive market has taken root since the mid-20th century, focusing on weight loss regimens, products and surgeries. This market has been aided by the rising number of [[overweight]] and [[obesity|obese]] citizens in the United States. Data from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, indicates that the average weight of women between ages 30 and 60 has increased by 20 pounds, or 14%, since 1976. Among women who weigh 300 pounds or more, the increase was 18%.

However, some research has indicated the opposite pattern. It has been suggested that obesity among women residing in the U.S. has become more socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/79184.php Obesity Among Women In U.S. Becoming More Socially Acceptable, Study Says]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study published in the July issue of Economic Inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.2007.00025.x| title=Social Dynamics of Obesity|author1=Phu Tang |author2=Frank Heiland | journal=Economic Inquiry| year=2007| volume=45| issue=3| pages=571–591}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is likely because more than one-third of women aged 20 and older are obese in the United States. The study found that the average woman weighed 147 pounds in 1994, but stated that she wanted to weigh 132 pounds. By 2002, the average women weighed 153 pounds, but said that she wanted to weigh 135 pounds. "The fact that even the desired weight of women has increased suggests there is less social pressure to lose weight," the researchers noted. However, the difference between women's average weight and desired weight had increased as well.

In any case, weight gain and weight loss are still charged topics. The ever-present social stigma concerning weight gain, can have lasting and harmful effects on individuals, especially among young women. These are thought to include [[eating disorder]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eisenberg | first1 = ME | last2 = Neumark-Sztainer | first2 = D | last3 = Story | first3 = M | last4 = Perry | first4 = C | title = The role of social norms and friends' influences on unhealthy weight-control behaviors among adolescent girls | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 6 | pages = 1165–73 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15626514 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.06.055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700054945 | last1 = Garner | first1 = DM | last2 = Garfinkel | first2 = PE | title = Socio-cultural factors in the development of anorexia nervosa | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 647–56 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7208724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[body dysmorphic disorder|body dysmorphia]].

== In sports ==
Weight gain is seen in professional sports most notably in [[combat sports]] because of their weight divisions. It occurs mostly in [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[puroresu]] and [[professional wrestling]].{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

==Simple explanation==

[[Surface friction]] forces the surface [[wind]] to slow and turn near the surface of the [[Earth]], blowing directly towards the low pressure, when compared to the winds in the nearly frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AMS Glossary of Meteorology, Ekman layer | publisher = [[American Meteorological Association]] | url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Ekman_layer | accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This layer, where surface friction slows the wind and changes the wind direction, is known as the [[planetary boundary layer]]. Daytime solar heating due to [[insolation]] thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft. Radiative cooling overnight decouples the winds at the surface from the winds above the boundary layer, increasing vertical wind shear near the surface, also known as wind gradient.

==Background==
{{see also|Ekman layer|Ekman spiral|Planetary boundary layer|Surface layer}}
Typically, due to [[aerodynamic]] [[drag (force)|drag]], there is a wind gradient in the wind flow just a few hundred meters above the Earth's surface—the [[surface layer]] of the [[planetary boundary layer]]. Wind speed increases with increasing height above the ground, starting from zero&lt;ref name=Wizelius&gt;{{cite book | last = Wizelius | first = Tore | title = Developing Wind Power Projects | publisher = Earthscan Publications Ltd | location = London | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-84407-262-0 | pages = 40 | quote = The relation between wind speed and height is called the wind profile or wind gradient.}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the [[no-slip condition]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = G. | title = Sun, Wind &amp; Light | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2001 | pages = 18 | isbn = 978-0-471-34877-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flow near the surface encounters obstacles that reduce the wind speed, and introduce random vertical and horizontal velocity components at right angles to the main direction of flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|quote=Flow near the surface encounters small obstacles that change the wind speed and introduce random vertical and horizontal velocity components at right angles to the main direction of flow.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This [[turbulence]] causes vertical [[Mixing (physics)|mixing]] between the air moving horizontally at one level, and the air at those levels immediately above and below it, which is important in dispersion of [[pollutants]]&lt;ref name=Hadlock/&gt; and in [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref name=Lal/&gt;

The reduction in velocity near the surface is a function of surface roughness, so wind velocity profiles are quite different for different terrain types.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Rough, irregular ground, and man-made obstructions on the ground, retard movement of the air near the surface, reducing wind velocity.&lt;ref name=Oke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;{{cite book | last = Crawley | first = Stanley | title = Steel Buildings | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-471-84298-9 | pages = 272 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of low surface roughness on the relatively smooth water surface, wind speeds do not increase as much with height above sea level as they do on land.&lt;ref name=Lubosny&gt;{{cite book | last = Lubosny | first = Zbigniew | title = Wind Turbine Operation in Electric Power Systems: Advanced Modeling | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-3-540-40340-1 | pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a city or rough terrain, the wind gradient effect could cause a reduction of 40% to 50% of the [[geostrophic wind]] speed aloft; while over open water or ice, the reduction may be only 20% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harrison | first = Roy | title = Understanding Our Environment | publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry | location = Cambridge | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-85404-584-6 | pages = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = Russell | title = Atmospheric Processes and Systems | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-415-17145-8 | pages = 102–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[engineering]] purposes, the wind gradient is modeled as a [[simple shear]] exhibiting a vertical velocity profile varying according to a [[power law]] with a constant [[exponent]]ial coefficient based on surface type. The height above ground where surface friction has a negligible effect on wind speed is called the "gradient height" and the wind speed above this height is assumed to be a constant called the "gradient wind speed".&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite book | last = Gupta | first = Ajaya | title = Guidelines for Design of Low-Rise Buildings Subjected to Lateral Forces | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-8493-8969-6 | pages = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stoltman | first = Joseph | title = International Perspectives on Natural Disasters: Occurrence, Mitigation, and Consequences | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4020-2850-2 | pages = 73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, typical values for the predicted gradient height are 457 m for large cities, 366 m for suburbs, 274 m for open terrain, and 213 m for open sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chen | first = Wai-Fah | title = Handbook of Structural Engineering | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-8493-2674-5 | pages = 12–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering==

The design of buildings must account for wind loads, and these are affected by wind gradient. The respective gradient levels, usually assumed in the Building Codes, are 500 meters for cities, 400 meters for suburbs, and 300 m for flat open terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Augusti | first = Giuliano | title = Probabilistic Methods in Structural Engineering | publisher = Chapman and Hall | location = London | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0-412-22230-6 |pages = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For engineering purposes, a power law wind speed profile may be defined as follows:&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_z&lt;/math&gt; = speed of the wind at height &lt;math&gt;\ z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ v_g&lt;/math&gt; = gradient wind at gradient height &lt;math&gt;\ z_g &lt;/math&gt;

===Wind turbines===

[[Wind turbine]]s are affected by wind gradient.

For wind turbine engineering, a polynomial variation in wind speed with height can be defined relative to wind measured at a reference height of 10 meters as:&lt;ref name=Heier/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_w(h) = v_{10} \cdot \left(  \frac {h} {h_{10}} \right)^ a
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_w(h)&lt;/math&gt; = velocity of the wind &lt;nowiki&gt;[m/s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, at height &lt;math&gt; h&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ v_{10}&lt;/math&gt; = velocity of the wind &lt;nowiki&gt;[m/s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, at height &lt;math&gt; h_{10} &lt;/math&gt; = 10 meters
:&lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt; = Hellmann exponent

The [[Gustav Hellmann|Hellmann]] exponent depends upon the coastal location and the shape of the terrain on the ground, and the stability of the air. Examples of values of the Hellmann exponent are given in the table below:

==Gliding==

[[File:FAA-8083-13 Fig 7-20.PNG|thumb|right|Glider ground launch wind gradient effect.]]
In gliding, wind gradient affects the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]].
Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on [[ground launch]]es. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden,
or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding
the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the
gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When landing, wind gradient is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Longland | first = Steven | title = Gliding | publisher = Crowood Press, Limited, The | location = City | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1-86126-414-5 | pages= 125 | quote=The reason for making the increase is because the wind speed increases with height (a `wind gradient')}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.&lt;ref name=Piggott&gt;{{cite book | last = Piggott | first = Derek | title = Gliding: a Handbook on Soaring Flight | publisher = Knauff &amp; Grove | location =  | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-9605676-4-5 | pages = 85–86, 130–132 | quote= The wind gradient is said to be steep or pronounced when the change in wind speed with height is very rapid, and it is in these conditions that extra care must be used when taking off or landing in a glider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind gradient is also a hazard for aircraft making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long [[wingspan]], which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given [[Roll (flight)|bank]] angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident.&lt;ref name=Piggott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knauff | first = Thomas | title = Glider Basics from First Flight to Solo | publisher = Thomas Knauff | location =  | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0-9605676-3-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rolling moment generated by the different airflow over each wing can exceed the [[aileron]] control authority, causing the glider to continue rolling into a steeper bank angle.&lt;ref name=Conway&gt;{{cite book | last = Conway | first = Carle | title = Joy of Soaring | publisher = Soaring Society of America, Incorporated | location = City | year = 1989 | isbn = 978-1-883813-02-4 }} If the pilot runs into the wind gradient as he is turning into the wind, it is easy to see that there will be less wind across the lower than the higher wing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sailing==
In [[sailing]], wind gradient affects [[sailboats]] by presenting a different wind speed to the [[sail]] at different heights along the [[mast (sailing)|mast]]. The direction also varies with height, but sailors refer to this as "wind shear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jobson | first = Gary | title = Gary Jobson's Championship Sailing | publisher = International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press | location = City | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-07-142381-6 | pages = 180 | quote=Wind shear is the difference in direction at varying heights above the water; wind gradient is the difference in wind strength at varying heights above the water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mast head instruments indication of apparent wind speed and direction is different from what the sailor sees and feels near the surface.&lt;ref name=Jobson&gt;{{cite book | last = Jobson | first = Gary | title = Championship Tactics: How Anyone Can Sail Faster, Smarter, and Win Races | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 978-0-312-04278-3 | pages = 323 | quote = You'll not recognize wind shear if your apparent wind angle is smaller on one tack than on the other because the apparent wind direction is a combination of boat speed and wind speed - and the sailing speed may be more determined by water conditions in one direction rather than another. This means that the faster a boat goes the more 'ahead' the apparent wind becomes. That is why the 'close reach' direction is the fastest direction of sailing – simply because as the boat speeds up the apparent wind direct goes further and further forward without stalling the sails and the apparent wind speed also increases – so increasing the boat's speed even further. This particular factor is exploited to the full in sand-yachting in which it is common for a sand yacht to exceed the wind speed as measured by a stationary observer. Wind shear is certainly felt because the wind speed at the masthead will be higher than at deck level. Thus gusts of wind can capsize a small sailing boat easily if the crew are not sufficiently wary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrett/&gt; [[Sailmaker]]s may introduce [[sail twist]] in the design of the sail, where the head of the sail is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the [[lift distribution]] with height. The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions.&lt;ref name=Garrett/&gt; [[Sailors]] may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for wind gradient, for example using a [[boom vang]].&lt;ref name=Garrett&gt;{{cite book | last = Garrett | first = Ross | title = The Symmetry of Sailing | publisher = Sheridan House | location = Dobbs Ferry | year = 1996 | pages = 97–99, 108 | isbn = 978-1-57409-000-0 | quote = Wind speed and direction are normally measured at the top of the mast, and the wind gradient must therefore be known in order to determine the mean wind speed incident on the sail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Bethwaite
  |first = Frank
  |title = High Performance Sailing
  |publisher = Waterline (1993), Thomas Reed Publications (1996, 1998, and 2001), and Adlard Coles Nautical (2003 and 2007)
  |year = first published in 1993; new edition in 1996, reprinted in 2007
  |isbn = 978-0-7136-6704-2}} See sections 3.2 and 3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; the wind gradient is not significant for sailboats when the wind is over 6 knots (because a wind speed of 10 knots at the surface corresponds to 15 knots at 300 meters, so the change in speed is negligible over the height of a sailboat's mast).  According to the same source, the wind increases steadily with height up to about 10 meters in 5 knot winds but less if there is less wind. That source states that in winds with average speeds of six knots or more, the change of speed with height is confined almost entirely to the one or two meters closest to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 11 of the cited book by Bethwaite&lt;/ref&gt;  This is consistent with another source, which shows that the change in wind speed is very small for heights over 2 meters&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onemetre.net/Design/Gradient/Gradient.htm concerning design of radio-controlled model yachts&lt;/ref&gt; and with a statement by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/nsw/amfs/Wind%20Shear.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; according to which differences can be as little as 5% in unstable air.&lt;ref&gt;As explained in Bethwaite's book, the air is turbulent near the surface if the wind speed is greater than 6 knots&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[kitesurfing]], the wind gradient is even more important, because the [[power kite]] is flown on 20-30m lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Currer | first = Ian | title = Kitesurfing | publisher = Lakes Paragliding | location = City | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-9542896-0-7 | pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the kitesurfer can use the kite to jump off the water, bringing the kite to even greater heights above the sea surface.

==Sound propagation==

Wind gradient can have a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere. This effect is important in understanding sound propagation from distant sources, such as [[foghorn]]s, [[thunder]], [[sonic boom]]s, [[gunshot]]s or other phenomena like [[mistpouffers]]. It is also important in studying [[noise pollution]], for example from [[roadway noise]] and [[aircraft noise]], and must be considered in the design of [[noise barrier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When wind speed increases with altitude, wind blowing towards the listener from the source will refract sound waves downwards, resulting in increased noise levels downwind of the barrier.&lt;ref name=Bies&gt;{{cite book | last = Bies | first = David | title = Engineering Noise Control; Theory and Practice | publisher = Spon Press | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-415-26713-7 | pages = 235 | quote = As wind speed generally increases with altitude, wind blowing towards the listener from the source will refract sound waves downwards, resulting in increased noise levels.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These effects were first quantified in the field of highway engineering to address variations of noise barrier efficacy in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x1707075n815g604/  C.Michael Hogan, '' Analysis of Highway Noise'', Journal of Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution, Vol. 2, No. 3, Biomedical and Life Sciences and Earth and Environmental Science Issue, Pages 387–392, September 1973, Springer Verlag, Netherlands {{ISSN|0049-6979}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the sun warms the Earth's surface, there is a negative [[temperature gradient]] in atmosphere. The [[speed of sound]] decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative [[sound speed gradient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A wind speed gradient of 4 (m/s)/km can produce refraction equal to a typical temperature [[lapse rate]] of 7.5&amp;nbsp;°C/km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Uman | first = Martin | title = Lightning | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 978-0-486-64575-9 | pages = 196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher values of wind gradient will refract sound downward toward the surface in the downwind direction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Volland | first = Hans | title = Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-8493-8647-3 | pages = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; eliminating the acoustic shadow on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind. This downwind refraction effect occurs because there is a wind gradient; the sound is not being carried along by the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Singal | first = S. | title = Noise Pollution and Control Strategy | publisher = Alpha Science International, Ltd | location =  | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-84265-237-4 | pages = 7 | quote = It may be seen that refraction effects occur only because there is a wind gradient and it is not due to the result of sound being convected along by the wind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There will usually be both a wind gradient and a temperature gradient. In that case, the effects of both might add together or subtract depending on the situation and the location of the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=...there will usually be both a wind gradient and a temperature gradient.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The wind gradient and the temperature gradient can also have complex interactions. For example, a foghorn can be audible at a place near the source, and a distant place, but not in a sound shadow between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the case of transverse sound propagation, wind gradients do not sensibly modify sound propagation relative to the windless condition; the gradient effect appears to be important only in upwind and downwind configurations.&lt;ref name=Malbequi1993&gt;{{cite journal

For sound propagation, the exponential variation of wind speed with height can be defined as follows:&lt;ref name=Bies/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ U(h) = U(0) h ^ \zeta
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac {dU} {dH} = \zeta \frac {U(h)} {h}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt; \ U(h)&lt;/math&gt; = speed of the wind at height &lt;math&gt; \ h&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \ U(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a constant
:&lt;math&gt; \ \zeta&lt;/math&gt; = exponential coefficient based on ground surface roughness, typically between 0.08 and 0.52
:&lt;math&gt; \ \frac {dU} {dH}&lt;/math&gt; = expected wind gradient at height &lt;math&gt; h&lt;/math&gt;

In the 1862 [[American Civil War]] [[Battle of Iuka]], an [[acoustic shadow]], believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cornwall | first = Sir | title = Grant as Military Commander | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Inc | location =  | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-1-56619-913-1 |page =  92}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cozzens | first = Peter | title = The Darkest Days of the War: the Battles of Iuka and Corinth | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | location = Chapel Hill | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8078-5783-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have understood the effect of wind gradient upon [[refraction]] of sound since the mid-1900s; however, with the advent of the U.S. [[Noise Control Act]], the application of this refractive phenomena became applied widely beginning in the early 1970s, chiefly in the application to noise propagation from [[highway]]s and resultant design of transportation facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C.

Wind gradient soaring, also called [[dynamic soaring]], is a technique used by [[soaring birds]] including [[albatross]]es.
