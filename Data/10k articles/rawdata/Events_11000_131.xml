On 4 July 1989, a pilotless [[MiG-23]] jet fighter of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] crashed into a house in [[Kortrijk]], Belgium, killing one person. The pilot had ejected over an hour earlier near [[Kołobrzeg]], Poland, after experiencing technical problems, but the aircraft continued flying for around {{cvt|900|km|-2}} before running out of fuel and descending into the ground.

== History of the flight ==

The incident started as a routine training flight. Colonel Nikolai Skuridin&lt;!-- not Skurigin, see Talk Page --&gt;, the pilot, was to fly a MiG-23M from the [[Bagicz]] Airbase near [[Kołobrzeg]], Poland. During takeoff, the engine's [[afterburner]] failed, causing a partial loss of power. At an altitude of {{cvt|150|m|-2}} and descending, the pilot elected to abandon the aircraft and ejected safely. However, the engine kept running and the aircraft remained airborne, flying on [[autopilot]] in a westerly direction.&lt;ref name="eastern"&gt;[http://mm.iit.uni-miskolc.hu/Data/Winx/stories/accid23.html Incident overview from Eastern Wings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/06/world/belgians-protest-to-soviets-over-crash-of-derelict-mig.html |title=Belgians Protest to Soviets Over Crash of Derelict MIG |newspaper=New York Times |date=6 July 1989 |accessdate=16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unmanned aircraft left Polish airspace, crossing into [[East Germany]] and then [[West Germany]], where it was intercepted by a pair of [[F-15]]s from the [[32d Tactical Fighter Squadron]] of the [[United States Air Forces Europe]], stationed at [[Soesterberg Air Base]] in the Netherlands. The F-15 pilots reported that the MiG had no crew.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Steve, and Dildy, Doug, "F-15 Eagle Engaged – The World's Most Successful Jet Fighter", Osprey Publishing, Botley, Oxford, UK, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-84603-169-4}}, pages 102–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MiG-23 crossed into Dutch airspace and continued into Belgium. The escorting F-15s were instructed to shoot down the plane over the [[North Sea]], but as the MiG ran out of fuel, it started a slow turn to the south, prompting the French Air Force to put its fighters on alert. After flying over {{cvt|900|km}}, the MiG eventually crashed into a house near [[Kortrijk]], less than {{cvt|10|km|0}} from the French border, killing an 18-year-old resident.&lt;ref name="eastern"/&gt;

== Political aftermath ==

The Belgian government made a formal protest to the Soviet Union for the lack of notification about the stray aircraft. The then Belgian Foreign Minister [[Mark Eyskens]] expressed concern that "from the time the MiG-23 was first picked up on [[NATO]] radar to the time it crashed more than an hour later, no word of warning came from the Soviet side," and that "there was also a 'notable slowness' on the part of the Soviets in disclosing whether the jet was carrying nuclear or toxic weapons."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tödliche Kunststücke Pilot kommt bei Absturz ums Leben |url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/toedliche-kunststuecke-pilot-kommt-bei-absturz-ums-leben--5970448 |accessdate=16 June 2018 |publisher=Berliner Zeitung |date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft took off from runway 10 at ''Eberswalde Finow Airfield'' shortly after 12:04. After takeoff, the pilot proceed to where the festival was taking place and then made several low passes from easterly and westerly directions. On the pass at which the accident happened, the aircraft was making an inverted pass from an easterly direction, at very low altitude, when suddenly, the engine lost power. The pilot immediately started rolling the aircraft right side up but the right wing tip tank collided with ground, which reversed the roll and the aircraft crashed upside down.&lt;ref name="bfu" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center--&gt;
There was no fire except from a brief flash of fire as the right wing tip tank was ruptured and the spray was ignited at initial impact.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfall in Finow Race 61 Kunstflieger abgestürzt|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRGBQlHojMA|publisher=Pierre Meliß, YouTube|accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured in the crash. The aircraft, which was destroyed in the accident, crashed into the [[Solarpark Finow Tower]] destroying a number of solar panels. No one on the ground was injured in the accident.&lt;ref name="bfu" /&gt;

==Aircraft==
The Zlin 526 is a [[low wing]] single seat acrobatics aircraft powered by a 180&amp;nbsp;hp [[Avia M 137]] 6-cylinder in-line engine. The 1967 built accident aircraft, serial number 1119 was bought in the [[Czech Republic]] by the German accident pilot 29 March 2013.&lt;ref name="asn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bfu" /&gt;

The fuel system of the Zlin, optimised for aerobatics, consist of 2 wing tanks gravity feeding a {{convert|5|l|USgal|abbr=on}} collector tank in the fuselage. A fuel pump draws fuel from the collector tank and supplies fuel - via filters - for the fuel injection pump, which in turn delivers fuel via separate lines to each of the 6 cylinders. In inverted flight, the collector tank is not filled and a one-way check valve ensures fuel does not return to the wing tank. The accident aircraft was fitted with optional wing tip tanks.&lt;ref name="bfu" /&gt;

As of 24 November 2012 the aircraft had accumulated 3,284:19 operating hours and 18,243 flight cycles.&lt;ref name="bfu" /&gt;

==Investigation==
The [[German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation]] (BFU) investigated the accident. They found that the first landing at ''Eberswalde Finow Airfield'' was on 15 April 2013 and up to the day of the accident - although not properly recorded - several flights had taken place in Germany and into Poland from ''Eberswalde Finow Airfield''.

The investigation revealed that at the day of the accident, the aircraft did not have a valid registration, as per the contract of purchase, the aircraft was supposed to be promptly deleted from the Czech register. Furthermore, the liability insurance policy had terminated on 1 May 2013.

According to BFU, the 47 year old accident pilot held a valid Private Pilot's License (PPL) and he held the rating as Pilot in Command (PIC) for Single Engine Piston land (SEP land). His license also had entries for aerobatics and night flight qualifications. The pilot had a valid class 2 medical certificate.

The pilot had accumulated 3,127:55 hours and 10,445 flight cycles as per last logbook entry 13 October 2012.&lt;ref name="bfu" /&gt;

The investigation further found that:
* the aerobatics display was performed without permit from the responsible authority
* exemption for aerobatics below 1500 feet (450 meters) had not been granted
* the inverted low pass was conducted at a height of 20–50 meters (66–165 feet) and some 20 meters (66 feet) in front of the spectators
* the right wing tank was undamaged and contained a low amount of fuel - left wing tank and both tip tanks were destroyed
* the collector tank was undamaged and empty
* only the fuel line of cylinder 1 contained small amount of fuel - the other 5 lines were dry
* the aircraft was serviced with [[Motor fuel|automotive fuel]] and not [[Avgas]] as required
* the engine was deemed in good technical condition
* aircraft was not certified for aerobatics as wing tip tanks were installed
* the pilot did not wear a parachute - instead, the seat had been filled with foam
* it was determined that control input by the pilot resulted in the aircraft veering off to the right in a nose-down attitude of 5-20 degrees during the unsuccessful recovery

==Causes==
BFU concluded that engine performance was impaired due to lack of fuel during inverted flight and errors in control inputs by the pilot during the roll back to normal flight attitude resulted in the collision with solar panels and subsequently the ground impact.

They further stated that the pilot's decision to conduct aerobatics in close proximity to the ground contributed to the accident.

* [[China]] set an all-time biggest global one-month record in February with RMB 10.14 billion ($1.6 billion), calculating revenues from both local and foreign films.

'''''After Aida''''' (original title: ''Verdi's Messiah'') is a 1985 play-with-music by [[Julian Mitchell]]. It is about [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and the pressure put upon him after his attempt to retire from composing. Continued insistent prodding from his friends eventually results in one of his greatest masterpieces, the opera ''[[Otello]]'', which premiered in 1887.

==Background and inception==
Brian McMaster, managing director of the [[Welsh National Opera]], commissioned the play, originally as a vehicle for the company's touring season to far-flung Welsh towns with smaller theatres than the average opera house. McMaster initially asked Julian Mitchell, author of the hit play-turned-film ''[[Another Country (play)|Another Country]]'', to write about the backstage life of an opera company. Mitchell, although he had been an opera fan in his youth, knew little about this milieu when he began working on the project.

In the course of his extensive research, however, Mitchell happened on "Boito and Verdi", the final chapter in Frank Walker's biography ''The Man Verdi''.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Frank. ''The Man Verdi''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982 (paperback edition). pp. 447–510.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a dramatic situation that immediately appealed to him – "a great artist going through a crisis, brought back to composition after a long silence, and finding himself a substitute prodigal son in the process" – and he took it as his subject matter.&lt;ref name=script&gt;Mitchell, Julian. [https://www.stageplays.com/products/after_aida ''After Aida'']. Amber Lane Press, 1986. pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

To familiarize himself with backstage and off-stage opera life, Mitchell took singing lessons, attended opera rehearsals and auditions, and talked to conductors, singers, directors, [[répétiteur]]s, and designers. Mitchell said he found that the restrictions placed on the piece—small stage, single set, and only a few actors—actually became liberating, and helped him create a well-crafted and artistically sound play.&lt;ref name=script /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The two-act play spans the years from 1879 to 1887, and centers around the composer Verdi and his life and works after he has retired from composing and moved to his country estate.

Verdi's two friends, [[Giulio Ricordi]] the publisher and [[Franco Faccio]] the conductor, convinced that Verdi should write another opera, try to persuade him to come out of retirement and collaborate with the young librettist [[Arrigo Boito]] on a new work. One likely subject for a new opera is the play ''[[Othello]]'', since Shakespeare is one of Verdi's favourite authors. Verdi's wife [[Giuseppina Strepponi]], tired of seeing him moping about, also assists in the attempt to get Verdi composing again.

The play focuses on this major turning point in Verdi’s creative life, and combines it with a selection of opera excerpts, drama, and humor. The production is punctuated with full arias and vocal ensembles from ''[[Aida]]'', ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Ernani]]'', the ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'', ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'', and ''[[Otello]]''. Also included are arias from Boito's ''[[Mefistofele]]'' and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]]''.

==Original productions==
''After Aida'' opened on 24 October 1985 in [[Swansea]], Wales, at the [[Taliesin Arts Centre|Taliesin Theatre]]. As planned, the production then toured to 11 other towns and cities throughout Wales.

The production starred [[Richard Griffiths]] (Verdi) and [[Ian Charleson]] (Boito), with a supporting cast that included four singers from the Welsh National Opera. It was directed by [[Howard Davies (director)|Howard Davies]], and the music director was Martin Andre. The show was produced by [[Robert Fox (producer)|Robert Fox]] with [[Ed Mirvish|Ed]] and [[David Mirvish]].

''After Aida'' received its [[London]] premiere at the [[Old Vic]] theatre, opening on 11 March 1986. Giuseppina Strepponi was played by [[Gemma Jones]], and the other cast members remained the same, except for a new cast of WNO singers.

==Original cast==
*[[Richard Griffiths]] – [[Giuseppe Verdi]], Italy's greatest opera composer, happily retired 
*[[Ian Charleson]] – [[Arrigo Boito]], young opera librettist; a nervous, self-doubting, neurotic genius
*[[Zoë Wanamaker]] – [[Giuseppina Strepponi]], former renowned soprano and Verdi's second wife; a strong, intelligent woman devoted to her husband
*[[Malcolm Storry]] – [[Giulio Ricordi]], Verdi's publisher; a solid, urbane man and Boito's good friend 
*[[David Lyon (actor)|David Lyon]] – [[Franco Faccio]], Verdi's favourite conductor; a prodigiously talented musician and a great friend to Boito

Additional performers, from the Welsh National Opera: 
*[[Soprano]]: Christine Teare
*[[Mezzo-soprano]]: Wendy Verco
*[[Tenor]]: Michael Burch
*[[Bass-baritone]]: Jonathan Best
*Pianist: Martin Andre

The 1986 London cast was the same except for [[Gemma Jones]], who played Giuseppina Strepponi. The singers, from the WNO, were as follows: sopranos Elizabeth Collier and Christine Teare, mezzo-sopranos Beverley Mills and Wendy Verco, tenors John Harris and Mark Hamilton, baritones Henry Newman and Steven Page, and pianists Martin Andre and Michael Lloyd.

==Critical reception and publication==
''After Aida'' has received largely favorable reviews,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/product-description/0906399688 Review snippets] on Amazon.co.uk. Retrieved 26 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been praised for its intelligence, humor, and panache. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' review said "the plot ... is quite riveting.... For all that we know the outcome, it has us on tenterhooks!”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stageplays.com/products/after_aida ''After Aida''] at the Internet Theater Bookshop (''StagePlays.com''). Retrieved 26 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The play has occasionally been compared to ''[[Amadeus]]'', with ''After Aida'' being noted for its accuracy, thoughtfulness, and erudition, and ''Amadeus'' having the edge in terms of raw dramatic impact.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Martin.

'''''Bent Coppers: The Inside Story of Scotland Yard's Battle Against Police Corruption''''' is a non-fiction book by award-winning British journalist Graeme McLagan. First published in the United Kingdom in 2003 by [[Orion Publishing Group]], the book examines [[police corruption]] within the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] and [[National Crime Squad|South Eastern Regional Crime Squad]]—with particular focus on the 1990s and early 2000s—and the establishment and activities of the force's anti-corruption "Ghost Squad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When cops are robbers

==Libel case==
Following publication, McLagan and Orion were sued for [[libel]] by Michael Charman, a former [[detective constable]] with the [[Flying Squad]] who had been "required to resign" from the Metropolitan Police for "discreditable conduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|authorlink=Duncan Campbell (journalist, born 1944)|title=Ex-policeman sues publisher for libel|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=20 June 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jun/20/books.media|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mclagan"&gt;{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=McLagan|title=Brought to book: Bent Coppers, a book about Scotland Yard's battle against police corruption, led to a four-year libel ordeal for its author|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=15 October 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/15/mondaymediasection2|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charman alleged that the book libelled him by "suggesting that there were 'cogent grounds' of suspecting him of being involved in corruption." In seeking to have Charman's claim for damages dismissed, the author and publisher cited the "[[Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd|Reynolds defence]]" of [[qualified privilege]], which protected publication of an allegation if it was made in the [[public interest]] and satisfied the test of [[Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd#Lords judgement: the ten criteria|responsible journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|authorlink=Duncan Campbell (journalist, born 1944)|title=Author facing libel claim 'tried to be fair'|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=21 June 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jun/21/books.booksnews|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite news|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|authorlink=Duncan Campbell (journalist, born 1944)|title=The future of libel starts here: An appeal court hearing starts today that could have a big impact on crime and current affairs writers|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=19 March 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/19/mondaymediasection12|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court of Justice of England and Wales]], Mr Justice Grey ruled that the book "did not pass all the necessary tests of "responsible journalism" and was not entitled to protection" of qualified privilege.&lt;ref name=mclagan/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; Following the reaffirmation of the Reynolds defence in ''[[Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe Sprl]]'' in October 2006, in which the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] sitting in the [[House of Lords]] determined that libel judges in the lower courts had been interpreting the criteria too strictly, McLagan and Orion appealed their case.&lt;ref name=mclagan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Landmark libel ruling grants more freedom to journalists|first=Clare|last=Dyer|date=12 October 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/12/mainsection.uk|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 October 2007, Lord Justice Ward, Lord Justice Sedley and Lord Justice Hooper, sitting in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], allowed the appeal and dismissed Charman's claim for damages—the first time that the Reynolds defence had succeeded in the publication of a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=11 October 2007|title=Case is 'victory for journalism'|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7039504.stm|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their ruling, the judges said they were satisfied that the book was a piece of responsible journalism, that McLagan had taken steps to verify the story and that "as a result of his honesty, his expertise on the subject, his careful research and his painstaking evaluation of a mass of material, the book was protected."&lt;ref name=pressgazette/&gt; Caroline Kean, McLagan's solicitor, called the ruling "ground-breaking and momentous", and said: "This is an unambiguous confirmation by the Court of Appeal that Reynolds is alive and kicking. It is not limited to newspapers, it means all media and there is no time constraint. It applies equally to a book and, by analogy, it will apply to a film or a TV programme, providing it is something of proper public interest and a journalist has done his very best to act in the course of responsible journalism."&lt;ref name=pressgazette/&gt;

'''''Billiken''''' is a weekly children's magazine in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the oldest [[Spanish language]] magazine for young people.&lt;ref name=pub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.perfil.com/2013/04/12/periodismo-para-los-chicos/|title=Journalism for children|work=News Magazine|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by [[Uruguayan|Uruguay]] journalist [[Constancio C. Vigil]] and its first issue appeared on [[November 17]] of [[1919]].

==History==
''Billiken'' was founded by [[Constancio C. Vigil]],&lt;ref name=pub/&gt;&lt;ref name=ewp&gt;[http://www.europaworld.com/pub/entry/ar.dir.313 Billiken] ''Europa World Plus''. Retrieved 6 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Uruguay]]an-born journalist who also founded ''[[El Gráfico]]''. Its current director is Juan Carlos Porras. The first edition of the magazine appeared on November, 17 1919. One of the cartoonists that worked for ''Billiken'' was [[Manuel García Ferré]], with his character Pi Pío.

The name [[Billiken]] is taken from a popular charm doll of the time, a smiling Buddha-like deity created in 1908 by the American art teacher and illustrator [[Florence Pretz]]. To Constancio C. Vigil, who was looking for a title for his unpublished children's magazine, it seemed like a good idea to use the name of a doll that Argentine children believed could bring you good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La historia de Billiken |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705174214/http://www.billiken.com.ar/nosotros.php |website=billiken.com.ar |publisher=Billiken Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Billiken Lore by Dorothy Jean Ray |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211104044/http://www.billikenlore.com:80/billikentext.html |website=billikenlore.com |publisher=Billiken Lore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of issue No. 1 had a boy with a soccer ball under his right arm, and a bandage on his head that covered his left eye. This image of the disheveled "neighborhood child" was the emblem of the magazine for several decades.

''Billiken'' has its headquarters in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=ewp/&gt; The publisher of the magazine is Editorial Atlántida S.A.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt; The magazine targets school-age children and contains a mixture of games, stories, cartoons and news about movies, music and celebrities.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt; Characters made popular in the magazine include 'The Travelling Ant', 'Marta and Jorge' and 'Misia Pepa'.

''Billiken'' is widely available in Uruguay, Argentina and other [[South America|South American]] countries.

The circulation of ''Billiken'' was 58,816 copies in 2010, 54,373 copies in 2011 and 54,064 copies in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 50 Magazines|url=http://ifabc.org/site/assets/media/Top-50-magazines-30042014.xlsx|work=IFABC|accessdate=5 August 2015|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The domain name for ''Billiken'' magazine was billiken.com.ar, but is current held by the office of the [[Secretaría_Legal_y_Técnica_de_la_Presidencia_de_la_Nación_Argentina|Legal and Technical Secretariat of the Presidency of Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WHOIS Service |url=https://www.iana.org/whois?q=billiken.com.ar |website=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority |publisher=IANA |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Secretaría Legal y Técnica de la Presidencia de la Nación Argentina |url=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretaría_Legal_y_Técnica_de_la_Presidencia_de_la_Nación_Argentina |website=es.wikipedia.org |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2018}}

== Controversy ==

The '''British Empire Economic Conference''' (also known as the '''Imperial Economic Conference''' or '''Ottawa Conference''') was a 1932 [[meeting|conference]] of British colonies and the autonomous [[dominion]]s held to discuss the [[Great Depression]]. It was held between 21 July and 20 August in [[Ottawa]].

The conference saw the group admit the failure of the [[gold standard]] and abandon attempts to return to it. The meeting also worked to establish a zone of limited [[tariff]]s within the [[British Empire]], but with high tariffs with the rest of the world. This was called "[[Imperial preference]]" or "Empire Free-Trade" on the principle of "home producers first, empire producers second, and foreign producers last". The result of the conference was a series of bilateral agreements that would last for at least 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imperial Economic Conference|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/283893/Imperial-Economic-Conference|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; This abandonment of open [[free trade]] led to a split in the British [[UK National Government|National Government]] coalition: the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Official Liberals]] under [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] left the Government, but the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] remained.

The conference was especially notable for its adoption of [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] ideas such as lowering [[interest rate]]s, increasing the [[money supply]], and expanding [[government spending]].

The United States were annoyed by the implementation of Imperial Preference as it affected them economically.&lt;ref&gt;A. Dobson, "Economic Diplomacy at the Atlantic Conference", ''Review of International Studies'' (1984) 10, pp.143.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the last Imperial Conference that any Irish government participated in, and also the last that Newfoundland attended as an independent Dominion.

British Empire Economic Conference delegates attended services at [[St. Matthew's Anglican Church (Ottawa)]] 26 July 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.ebay.ca/itm/1932-British-Imperial-Conference-Delegates-St-Matthew-Church-Ottawa-Press-Photo-/201233891418?nav=SEARCH British Imperial Conference delegates attended services at St. Matthew's Anglican Church, Ottawa]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heads of delegations==

The conference was hosted by the [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough|The Earl of Bessborough]], representing King [[George V]] and included the Prime Ministers and other leaders of the Empire and members of their respective cabinets:

'''''Commissioner v. Wilcox''''', 327 U.S. 404 (1946), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Wilcox|link=|volume=327|page=404|pin=|year=1946}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue presented in this case was whether [[Embezzlement|embezzled]] money constituted taxable income to the embezzler under § 22(a) of the [[Internal Revenue Code of 1939]].

Although the Court ruled that the embezzlement income was not taxable to the embezzler in ''Wilcox'', the Court later overruled this holding in ''[[James v. United States (1961)|James v. United States]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2652">'''Compounding a felony''' was an offence under the [[English law#Common law|common law of England]] and was classified as a [[misdemeanour]].  It consisted of a prosecutor or victim of an offence accepting anything of value under an agreement not to prosecute, or to hamper the prosecution of, a felony.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce &amp; Perkins, Criminal Law, 3rd ed. (1992) at 576.&lt;/ref&gt;  To "compound", in this context, means to come to a settlement or agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=compound - definition of compound by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/compound|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is not compounding for the victim to accept an offer to return stolen property, or to make restitution, as long as there is no agreement not to prosecute.

Under the common law, compounding a felony was punishable as a misdemeanor.  Many states have enacted statutes that punish the offense as a felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dasinger|first=Brian|title=Felonies|url=http://www.dasingerdefene.com/legal-services/criminal-defense/felonies/|accessdate=18 April 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compounding a misdemeanor is not a crime.{{cn|date=August 2015}}  However, an agreement not to prosecute a misdemeanor is unenforceable as being contrary to public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce &amp; Perkins, Criminal Law, 3rd ed. (1992) at 578.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Compounding has been abolished in [[England and Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] (c.58), section 5(5)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967]] (c.18) (N.I.), section 5(5)&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Republic of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1997]] (No.14), section 8(3)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Crimes Act 1900]], section 341 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s341.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In each of these cases, it has been replaced by a statutory offence.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6804">A '''deadly weapon''', sometimes '''dangerous weapon''', is an item that can inflict mortal or great bodily harm. By [[statute|statutory definition]], certain items, especially [[firearm]]s, are designated "deadly weapons ''[[wikt:per se#English|per se]]''", meaning they are regarded as deadly weapons no matter how they are used, from the Latin for "by itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadly Weapon|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/deadly_weapon|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, deadly weapons statutes often contain provisions covering other implements intended to be used to inflict harm.

The use or possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a crime often constitutes a [[Sentence (law)|penalty]] enhancer.  The deadly weapon penalty enhancer is premised on a belief that commission of the particular crime is inherently more dangerous.

In some jurisdictions, a distinction is made between deadly weapons and [[destructive device]]s, such as [[explosive]]s, [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] or [[poison gas]] [[bomb]]s, [[grenade]]s, [[land mine|landmines]], [[rocket]]s, [[missile]]s, or similar devices, including the unassembled components from which such devices can be made.

==Deadly weapons ''per se''==
A deadly weapon ''per se'' is usually defined as a [[firearm]] and may include [[knife|knives]] of a certain length (usually three inches or longer, depending on jurisdiction). Statutes list weapons such as [[switchblade]], [[gravity knife]], [[ballistic knife]], [[stiletto]], [[sword]], [[dagger]], [[blackjack (weapon)|blackjack]], [[brass knuckles]], [[nunchaku]] (fighting sticks),  [[shuriken]] (throwing stars), among others.

==Other deadly weapons==
Any object designed, made, or adapted for the purposes of inflicting death or serious physical injury can be considered a deadly weapon.

For example, a shoe or a shod foot used for kicking may be considered a dangerous weapon.&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth v. Marrero'', 19 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 922 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Assault and Battery by means of a Dangerous Weapon", [http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/courts-and-judges/courts/district-court/jury-instructions-criminal/6000-9999/6300-assault-and-battery-by-means-of-a-dangerous-weapon.pdf Jury Instruction 6.300], 2009 edition, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Florida Man |Florida man]] was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after throwing a live alligator through the open drive-through window of a fast food restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/02/09/assault-with-a-deadly-weapon-florida-man-charged-with-throwing-live-alligator-into-wendys/ |title=Assault with a deadly weapon: Florida man charged with throwing alligator into Wendy’s |author1=Niraj Chokshi |author2=Sarah Larimer |date=2016-02-09 |work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Texas a grand jury decided that a flashing [[GIF]], intended to provoke an epileptic seizure resulting in death, can be considered as a deadly weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kurt-eichenwald-case-texas-grand-jury-says-gif-deadly-weapon-n736316|title=Kurt Eichenwald Case: Texas Grand Jury Says a GIF Is a ‘Deadly Weapon’|date=March 21, 2017|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kelsey Shelton Smith-Briggs''' (December 28, 2002 – October 11, 2005) was a [[child abuse]] victim. She died at the home of her [[Mother|biological mother]] Raye Dawn Smith, and her [[stepfather]] Michael Lee Porter. Her death was ruled a [[homicide]].&lt;ref name="TulsaWorld12jan06"&gt;[[Tulsa World]] [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=12&amp;articleid=060112_Ne_A11_Toddl6731&amp;archive=yes Toddler's Death Ruled Homicide] retrieved 2009-09-05&lt;/ref&gt;  Kelsey had been "closely" observed by the [[Oklahoma Department of Human Services]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/secret-report-rips-dhs/article/3073745/ |first=Nolan|last=Clay |title= Secret Report Rips DHS |work=[[The Oklahoman]] |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate= 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; from January 2005 up to and including the day of her death.&lt;ref name="OKstateReview032706"&gt;Oklahoma Commission on Children and Youth Office of Juvenile System Oversight, Review of Child Death of Kelsey Smith-Briggs March 27, 2006 [http://www.crossroads.odl.state.ok.us/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/stgovpub&amp;CISOPTR=3494&amp;filename=3681.pdf#search=%22death.%22 Final Summary] Retrieved 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/article.aspx?subjectid=61&amp;articleid=051204_Op_G1_Whofa28461&amp;archive=yes |title= Who failed Kelsey?

==Birth and early childhood==
Kelsey was born on December 28, 2002, in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]] to [[Divorce|divorced parents]].  She lived with her mother, and maintained contact with her [[paternal]] family.  The first two years of her life were uneventful.  Before January 2005, no signs of abuse were reported to authorities, nor noticed by family members nor Kelsey's [[day care]] staff.&lt;ref name="NewsOK08jan06" /&gt;

==Abuse==
From January 2005 to the end of her life, Kelsey had suffered several documented and confirmed incidences of [[child abuse]].  Her injuries included a broken [[collarbone]], [[broken leg]]s, and multiple [[bruises]] and [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] on her [[face]] and [[human body|body]].&lt;ref name="OKstateReview032706"/&gt;

On January 17, 2005, the [[Oklahoma Department of Human Services]] (OKDHS) first confirmed abuse against Kelsey's mother after Kelsey was taken to a local [[emergency room]] with a broken collarbone, multiple bruises and abrasions to Kelsey's [[lower back]], [[buttocks]], and [[thigh]]s.&lt;ref name="OKstateReview032706" /&gt;

In April 2005, both of Kelsey's legs were broken. Medical examiners determined these were [[spiral fracture]]s in different stages of healing and were caused by child abuse. After this incident, Kelsey was taken into OKDHS (State's) custody.&lt;ref name="OKstateReview032706" /&gt;

On June 15, 2005, Kelsey was placed into the home of biological mother Raye Dawn Smith and stepfather Michael Lee Porter by [[Judge|Associate District Judge]] Craig Key, against an OKDHS recommendation.  The judge stated that the abuser was "unknown".&lt;ref name="NewsOK08jan06"&gt;''[[The Oklahoman]]'' [http://newsok.com/article/1727132/?template=news/main A broken life: The brief and tragic story of Kelsey Smith-Briggs] retrieved 2009-09-06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma Commission on Children and Youth Office of Juvenile System Oversight, Review of Child Death of Kelsey Smith-Briggs Addendum #1 - Court Proceedings of June 15 and June 16, 2005 [http://www.crossroads.odl.state.ok.us/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/stgovpub&amp;CISOPTR=3494&amp;filename=3681.pdf#search=%22death.%22 Addendum #1] Retrieved 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Kelsey Shelton Smith-Briggs died on October 11, 2005, at the home of her mother, Raye Dawn Smith, and her stepfather, Michael Lee Porter in [[Meeker, Oklahoma]]. Her death was ruled a [[homicide]] from [[blunt force trauma]] to the [[abdomen]].&lt;ref name="TulsaWorld12jan06"/&gt;

==Trial, verdict and sentences==
'''Michael Lee Porter''' (stepfather) was charged with [[sexual assault]] and [[first-degree murder]], but in February 2007 he pleaded guilty to enabling child abuse and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/stepfather-gets-30-years-in-toddlers-death/article/3007900 |title= Stepfather gets 30 years in toddler's death |work=[[The Oklahoman]] |date=2007-02-02 |accessdate= 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raye Dawn Smith''' (biological mother) was convicted on July 18, 2007 of enabling child abuse and was sentenced to 27 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/mom-found-guilty-jury-hands-down-27-year-prison-term/article/3086520 |first=Nolan|last=Clay |title= Mom found guilty; jury hands down 27-year prison term |work=[[The Oklahoman]] |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate= 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was denied her request for appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poncacitynews.com/templates/298403401614351.bsp |title=District Judge Rules on New Trial for Smith |date=October 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719164845/http://www.poncacitynews.com/templates/298403401614351.bsp |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kelsey Smith-Briggs Child Protection Reform Act==
In March 2006, the [[Oklahoma Legislature|Oklahoma state legislature]] passed the '''Kelsey Smith-Briggs Child Protection Reform Act''' to reform the way courts and the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OKDHS) handle cases related to child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oksenate.org/news/press_releases/press_releases_2006/pr20060426g.html |title=Senate Approves Kelsey’s Law |work=[[Oklahoma State Senate]] Communications Division |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727142101/http://www.oksenate.org/news/press_releases/press_releases_2006/pr20060426g.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill's co-author, Senator [[Harry Coates]], presented the measure in committee.

'''Decapitation''' is the complete separation of the [[human head|head]] from the body. Such an injury is fatal to humans and most animals, since it deprives all other organs of the [[autonomic nervous system|involuntary functions]] that are needed for the body to function, while the brain is deprived of oxygenated blood and blood pressure.

The term '''beheading''' refers to the act of deliberately decapitating a person, either as a means of murder or [[capital punishment|execution]]; it may be accomplished with an axe, sword, knife, or by mechanical means such as a [[guillotine]]. An [[executioner]] who carries out executions by beheading is called a [[headsman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/headsman|title=Definition of HEADSMAN|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accidental decapitation can be the result of an explosion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blows Head Off with Dynamite? |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1084009/decapitation_by_dynamite/|newspaper=The Rhinelander Daily News|date=2 April 1937|page=7|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 29 September 2014 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; car or industrial accident,{{Refn|See {{section link|Isadora Duncan|Death}}.|name=isadoraduncan|group=note}} improperly administered execution by [[hanging]] or other violent injury.

Less commonly, decapitation can also refer to the removal of the head from a body that is already dead. This might be done to take the head as a [[headhunting|trophy]], for [[gibbet|public display]], to make the deceased more difficult to identify, for [[cryonics]], or for other, more esoteric reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Larson. ''Severed: a history of heads lost and heads found'' Liveright, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ann |last=Fabian|title=Losing our Heads (review of Larson's "Severed" ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' |date=1 December 2014 |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Book-Review-Losing-Our-Heads/150255/?cid=cr|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word decapitation has its roots in the Late Latin word ''decapitare''. The meaning of the word ''decapitare'' can be discerned from its morphemes ''de-'' (down, from) + ''capit-'' (head).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Etymology|last2=Fleischer|first2=Rita|publisher=Focus|year=2008|isbn=9781585100125|edition=Second|location=|pages=|last1=Dunmore|first1=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The past participle of ''decapitare'' is ''decapitatus''&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=decapitation|title=Decapitation|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used to create ''decapitationem'', the noun form of ''decapitatus'' in Medieval Latin. From the Medieval Latin form, ''decapitationem'', the French word ''décapitation'' was produced.&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Anne Boleyn London Tower.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anne Boleyn]] in the [[Tower of London]] waiting to be executed by beheading, by [[Édouard Cibot]] (1799–1877)]]

Execution by beheading has been used as a form of [[capital punishment]] for millennia. The [[Narmer Palette]] (c. 3000 B.C.) shows the first known depiction of decapitated corpses. The terms "capital offence", "capital crime", "capital punishment," derive from the Latin ''caput'', "head", referring to the punishment for serious offences involving the forfeiture of the head; ''i.e.,'' death by beheading.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, edited by Noah Porter, published by G &amp; C. Merriam Co., 1913&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, such as ancient Rome and Greece, decapitation was regarded as the most honorable form of death.&lt;ref name=roberson&gt;{{cite book|author=Cliff Roberson, Dilip K. Das|title=An Introduction to Comparative Legal Models of Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pQLLBQAAQBAJ|page=172|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|isbn=9781420065930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extension of  the "privilege" of beheading to criminals of ordinary birth was among the symbolic changes brought about by the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=roberson/&gt; In other cases, such as the use of beheading by Japanese troops during World War II, its use was considered a form of contempt.&lt;ref name=roberson/&gt;  In recent times, it has become associated with terrorism.&lt;ref name=roberson/&gt;

== Physiological aspects ==
=== Pain ===

If the headsman's axe or [[executioner's sword|sword]] was sharp and his aim was precise, decapitation was quick and was presumed to be a relatively painless form of death. If the instrument was blunt or the executioner was clumsy, multiple strokes might be required to sever the head resulting in a prolonged and more painful death.  The person to be executed was therefore advised to give a gold coin to the headsman to ensure that he did his job with care. [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], required three strikes at their respective executions. The same could be said for the execution of [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]], favorite of the Danish queen [[Caroline Matilda of Great Britain|Caroline Matilda]].&lt;ref&gt;For Devereux's execution: Smollett, T.:"[https://books.google.com/books?id=T-M_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA488&amp;dq=robert+devereux+three+strokes&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pNEgUaeABeTh4QTYn4HAAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=robert%20devereux%20three%20strokes&amp;f=false A Complete History of England, from the Descent of Julius Caesar ..., Volum 4]" London 1758, p.488&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Mary, Queen of Scots:Cheetham, J.K.:"[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6ogOYZvE2wC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=mary+queen+of+scots+three+strokes&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ltIgUd7MDYuQ4gSV44GgAg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20queen%20of%20scots%20three%20strokes&amp;f=false On the Trail of Mary Queen of Scots]" Glasgow 2000, p.161&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury]], is said to have required up to ten strokes before decapitation was achieved.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Complete Peerage]]'', v. XII p. II, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; This particular story may, however, be apocryphal since highly divergent accounts exist. Historian and philosopher [[David Hume]], for example, relates the following about her death:&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D.:"[https://books.google.com/books?id=nl0TAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=execution+countess+of+salisbury&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtMgUcq-H9KK4gS_8YDADQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg The history of the reign of Henry the eighth]" London 1792, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|She refused to lay her head on the block, or submit to a sentence where she had received no trial. She told the executioner, that if he would have her head, he must win it the best way he could: and thus, shaking her venerable grey locks, she ran about the scaffold; and the executioner followed her with his ax, aiming many fruitless blows at her neck before he was able to give the fatal stroke.}}[[File:CosmasDamianfraangelico.jpg|thumb|''The Beheading of [[Cosmas and Damian]]'', by [[Fra Angelico]]]]

To ensure that the blow would be fatal, executioners' swords usually were blade-heavy two-handed swords. Likewise, if an axe was used, it almost invariably was wielded with both hands. In England a [[bearded axe]] was used for beheading, with the blade's edge extending downwards from the tip of the shaft.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Finland]]'s official beheading axe resides today at the Museum of Crime in [[Vantaa]]. It is a broad-bladed two-handed axe. It was last used when murderer [[Tahvo Putkonen]] was executed in 1825, the last execution in peacetime in Finland.&lt;ref name="otonkoski-1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Otonkoski |first=Pirkko-Leena |title=Henkirikoksista kuolemaan tuomittujen kohtaloita vuosina 1824–1825 Suomessa |journal=Genos |volume=68 |pages=55–69, 94–95 |url=http://www.genealogia.fi/genos/68/68_55.htm |accessdate=14 December 2010 |language=Finnish |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uyNXe7J1?url=http://www.genealogia.fi/genos/68/68_55.htm |archivedate=14 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology of death by decapitation===
Decapitation is quickly fatal to humans and most animals. Unconsciousness occurs within 10 seconds without circulating oxygenated blood ([[brain ischemia]]). Cell death and irreversible [[brain damage]] occurs after 3–6 minutes with no oxygen due to [[excitotoxicity]]. Some anecdotes suggest more extended persistence of human consciousness after decapitation,&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Beaurieux, writing in 1905, quoted in {{cite book |last=Kershaw |first=Alister |title=A History of the Guillotine |year=1958 |publisher=John Calder |isbn=9781566191531}}, cited by {{cite web |url=http://thechirurgeonsapprentice.com/2012/08/13/losing-ones-head-a-frustrating-search-for-the-truth-about-decapitation/ |title=Losing One's Head: A Frustrating Search for the 'Truth' about Decapitation |work=The Chirurgeon's Apprentice |accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} but most doctors consider this unlikely and consider such accounts to be misapprehensions of reflexive twitching rather than deliberate movement, since deprivation of oxygen must cause nearly immediate coma and death ("[Consciousness is] probably lost within 2–3 seconds, due to a rapid fall of intracranial [[perfusion]] of blood.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hillman |first1=Harold |date=27 October 1983 |title=An Unnatural Way to Die |journal=New Scientist |pages=276–278 }} Cited in {{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/10-brain-myths6.htm |title=Top 10 Myths About the Brain |author=Shanna Freeman |work=How Stuff Works |page=5: Your Brain Stays Active After You Get Decapitated |accessdate=8 April 2014|date=2008-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animals (such as [[cockroach]]es) can survive decapitation, and die not because of the loss of the head directly, but rather because of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-cockroach-can-live-without-head|title=Fact or Fiction?: A Cockroach Can Live without Its Head|first=Charles|last=Choi|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of other animals, including [[Mike_the_Headless_Chicken|chicken]]s, [[turtle]]s and [[snake]]s have also been known to survive for some time after being decapitated, as they have a slower metabolism and their [[nervous system]]s can continue to function at some capacity for a limited time even after connection to the brain is lost, responding to any nearby stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leahy |first1=Stephen |title=Decapitated Snake Head Nearly Kills Man—Here's How |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/06/texas-man-bit-decapitated-rattlesnake-venom-animals/ |website=''[[National Geographic]]'' |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sjøgren |first1=Kristian |title=Why do headless chickens run? |url=http://sciencenordic.com/why-do-headless-chickens-run |website=SciencNordic |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AL man battles headless rattlesnake |url=http://www.wsfa.com/story/38376061/video-alabama-man-battles-headless-rattlesnake |website=WSFA 12 News |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[head transplant]]ation by the reattachment of blood vessels has been successful with animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Roach| first =Mary | year = 2004| title = Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers| publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co| location =| isbn = 978-0-393-32482-2| page = 208| title-link =Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers }}&lt;/ref&gt; a fully functional reattachment of a severed human head (including repair of the [[spinal cord]], muscles, and other critically important tissues) has not yet been achieved.

== Technology ==
=== Guillotine ===
[[File:Heads on pikes.jpg|left|thumb|Aristocratic heads on pikes — a cartoon from the [[French Revolution]]]]

Early versions of the guillotine included the [[Halifax Gibbet]], which was used in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], England, from 1286 until the 17th century, and the "[[Maiden (beheading)|Maiden]]", employed in [[Edinburgh]] from the 16th through the 18th centuries.

The modern form of the [[guillotine]] was invented shortly before the [[French Revolution]] with the aim of creating a quick and painless method of execution requiring little skill on the part of the operator. Decapitation by guillotine became a common mechanically assisted form of [[capital punishment|execution]].

The French observed a strict code of etiquette surrounding such executions. For example, a man named Legros, one of the assistants at the execution of [[Charlotte Corday]], was imprisoned for three months and dismissed for slapping the face of the victim after the blade had fallen in order to see whether any flicker of life remained.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Mignet|Mignet, François]], ''History of the French Revolution from 1789 to 1814'', (1824).&lt;/ref&gt; The guillotine was used in France during the French Revolution and remained the normal judicial method in both peacetime and wartime into the 1970s, although the [[firing squad]] was used in certain cases. France abolished the death penalty in 1981.

The guillotine was also used in [[Algeria]] before the [[France|French]] relinquished control of it, as shown in [[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s film ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]''.

Another guillotine existed in [[Vatican City]] until recent years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} It had been brought in by [[Napoleon]]'s forces during the early 19th century; and, as of 1870, the [[pope]] still claimed the authority to use it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The [[Holy See]] has since abolished capital punishment within its own jurisdiction, and recent popes have condemned capital punishment wherever it is still practised.

=== German Fallbeil ===
[[File:Auguste Vaillant execution.jpg|left|thumb|French anarchist [[Auguste Vaillant]] just before being guillotined in 1894]]

Many German states had used a [[guillotine]]-like device known as a ''Fallbeil'' ("falling axe") since the 17th and 18th centuries, and decapitation by guillotine was the usual means of execution in [[Germany]] until the abolition of the death penalty in [[West Germany]] in 1949.

In [[Nazi Germany]], the ''Fallbeil'' was reserved for common criminals and people convicted of [[political crime]]s, including [[treason]]. Members of the [[White Rose]] resistance movement, a group of students in [[Munich]] that included siblings [[Sophie Scholl|Sophie]] and [[Hans Scholl]], were famously executed by decapitation.

Contrary to popular myth, executions were generally not conducted face up, and chief executioner [[Johann Reichhart]] was insistent on maintaining "professional" protocol throughout the era, having administered the death penalty during the earlier [[Weimar Republic]]. Nonetheless, it is estimated that some 16,500 persons were guillotined in Germany and [[Austria]] between 1933 and 1945, a number that includes [[resistance fighter]]s both within Germany itself and in  [[German-occupied Europe|countries occupied by Nazi forces]]. As these resistance fighters were not part of any [[regular army]], they were considered [[unlawful combatants|common criminal]]s and were in many cases [[cattle car|transported]] to Germany for execution. Decapitation was considered a "dishonorable" death, in contrast to [[execution by firing squad]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The ''Fallbeil'' was used for the last time in West Germany in 1949 and in [[East Germany]] in 1966.

In the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], the conflict and ethnic massacre between local army and [[Kamuina Nsapu]] rebels has caused several deaths and atrocities like rape and mutilation. One of them is decapitation, which is a fearsome way to intimidate their victims, but it also depicts some ritualistic elements. According to an UN report from Congolese refugees, they believed the [[Bana Mura]] and Kamuina Nsapu militias have "magical powers" as consecuence of drinking the blood of decapitated victims that would make them invincible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/04/army-bewitched-children-involved-congo-massacres-un-reports/|title=Army of 'bewitched' children involved in Congo massacres as UN reports hundreds of deaths – The Telegraph English|publisher=|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=2017-08-04|last1=Staff|first1=Our Foreign}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some reports, they indeed feed the blood from their victims' heads to younger members as baptism rite, then they often burn the remains into the fire or sometimes they consume the human remains, committing [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kamuina-nsapu.htm/|title=Kamuina Nsapu: An Army of Bewitched Children  – GlobalSecurity.org English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the massive decapitations (like the beheading of 40 members of the State Police), a notorious case of worldwide impact happened in March 2017 to Swedish politician [[Zaida Catalán]] and American UN expert Michael Sharp, who were kidnapped and executed during a mission near the village Ngombe in the Kasai Province. The UN was reportedly horrified when video footage of the execution of the two experts surfaced in April that same year, where some grisly details led to assume ritual components of the beheading: the perpetrators proceeded to cut the hair of both victims first, and then one of them beheaded Catalan only, because it would "increase his power",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lalibre.be/dernieres-depeches/afp/meurtre-de-deux-experts-de-l-onu-la-rdc-presente-une-video-58fe3008cd70812a659fffed Meurtre de deux experts de l'ONU: la RDC présente une vidéo], Retrieved 5 August 2017|(In French)&lt;/ref&gt; which may be linked to the fact that Congolese militians are particularly brutal in their acts of violence toward women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23263&amp;LangID=E|title=

[[File:Caishikou Beheaded Corpses2.jpeg|thumb|Ranked beheaded bodies on the ground, in [[Caishikou Execution Grounds|Caishikou]], [[Beijing]], [[China]], 1905]]
In traditional [[China]], decapitation was considered a more severe form of punishment than strangulation, although strangulation caused more prolonged suffering. This was because in Confucian tradition, bodies were gifts from their parents, and so it was therefore disrespectful to their ancestors to return their bodies to the grave dismembered. The Chinese however had other punishments, such as dismembering the body into multiple pieces (similar to English [[hanged, drawn and quartered|quartering]]). In addition, there was also a practice of [[Waist chop|cutting the body at the waist]], which was a common method of execution before being abolished in the early Qing dynasty due to the lingering death it caused.  In some tales, people did not die immediately after decapitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbs.04gd.com/viewthread.php?tid=547&amp;fpage=1|title=原來斬頭係唔會即刻死既(仲識講野)中國有好多斬頭案例!!|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://人民网.cn/GB/kejiao/42/154/20030410/968308.html "无头人"挑战传统医学 人类还有个"腹脑"?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.66163.com/Fujian_w/news/fzwb/990124t/3-3.htm|title=福州晚報|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cst21.com.cn/3/hrt.htm|title=换人头|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pakistan ====
Pakistan's government employs death by hanging for capital punishment. Since 2007, militants from Tehrek-e-Taliban Pakistan have used beheadings as a form of punishment for opponents, criminals and spies in the north west region of Pakistan. Severed heads of opponents or government officials in Swat were left on popular street corners in order to terrorize local population. The beheadings have stopped in Swat since the military incursion and sweep-up that began in May 2009 and ended in June 2009. Three Sikhs were [[February 2010 Sikh beheadings by Taliban|beheaded]] by the Taliban in Pakistan in 2010. [[Daniel Pearl]] was beheaded by his captors in the city of Karachi.

Despite official condemnation from the state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/sgpc-punjab-government-condemn-sikh-beheading-in-pakistan_100324135.html|title=SGPC, Punjab government condemn Sikh beheading in Pakistan|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; itself, such beheading continues to flourish in the Taliban strongholds of [[Baluchistan]] and [[Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} and are often jarred and unprofessional{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} resulting in increased pain for the victim.

In [[Japan]], decapitation was a common punishment, sometimes for minor offences. [[Samurai]] were often allowed to decapitate soldiers who had fled from battle, as it was considered cowardly. Decapitation was historically performed as the second step in [[seppuku]] (ritual [[suicide]] by [[disembowelment]]). After the victim had sliced his own [[abdomen]] open, another warrior would strike his head off from behind with a [[katana]] to hasten death and to reduce the suffering. The blow was expected to be precise enough to leave intact a small strip of skin at the front of the neck—to spare invited and honored guests the indelicacy of witnessing a severed head rolling about, or towards them; such an occurrence would have been considered inelegant and in bad taste. The sword was expected to be used upon the slightest sign that the practitioner might yield to pain and cry out—avoiding dishonor to him and to all partaking in the privilege of observing an honorable demise. As skill was involved, only the most trusted warrior was honored by taking part. In the late [[Sengoku period]], decapitation was performed as soon as the person chosen to carry out seppuku had made the slightest wound to his abdomen.

Decapitation (without seppuku) was also considered a very severe and degrading form of punishment. One of the most brutal decapitations was that of {{ill|Sugitani Zenjubō|ja|杉谷善住坊}} (杉谷善住坊), who attempted to assassinate [[Oda Nobunaga]], a prominent ''[[daimyō]]'', in 1570. After being caught, Zenjubō was buried alive in the ground with only his head out, and the head was slowly sawn off with a bamboo saw by passers-by for several days (punishment by sawing; ''{{ill|nokogiribiki|ja|鋸挽き}}'' (鋸挽き).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%96%84%E4%BD%8F%E5%9D%8A] Asahi Dictionary of Japanese Historical Figures&lt;/ref&gt; These unusual punishments were abolished in the early [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era. This scene is described in the last page of James Clavell's book [[Shōgun (novel)|''Shōgun'']].

==== Korea ====
Historically, decapitation had been the most common method of execution in Korea, until it was replaced by [[hanging]] in 1896. Professional executioners were called ''mangnani'' (망나니) and they were volunteered from death-rows.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

=== Europe ===
====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
During the [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1992–1995) there were a number of ritual beheadings of Serbs and Croats who were taken as prisoners of war by [[Bosnian mujahideen|mujahedin]] members of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Army]].  At least one case is documented and proven in court by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] where mujahedin, members of 3rd Corps of Army BiH, beheaded [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] Dragan Popović.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2006/p1054-e.htm UN – TRIBUNAL CONVICTS ENVER HADZIHASANOVIC AND AMIR KUBURA Press Release, March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/had-3ai030926e.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805095536/http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/had-3ai030926e.htm |archivedate=5 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British====
The [[British Empire]] used beheading and display of severed heads and other body parts on pikes, etc., as a method to support conquest, territorial expansion, pillage and looting. Heads were displayed to terrify various peoples into submission, such as enslaved Africans, Tasmanians, Chinese, and Celts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stannard|first1=David E.|title=American Holocaust|date=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Vincent|title=The Reaper's Garden|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, beheading was typically used for noblemen, while commoners would be hanged; eventually, hanging was adopted as the standard means of non-military executions. The last actual execution by beheading was of [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]] on 9 April 1747, while a number of convicts (typically traitors sentenced to [[hanging, drawing and quartering|drawing and quartering]], a method which had already been discontinued) were beheaded posthumously up to the early 19th century. Beheading was degraded to a secondary means of execution, including for treason, with the abolition of drawing and quartering [[Forfeiture Act 1870|in 1870]] and finally abolished by [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973|at the monarch's discretion]] in 1973.

====Celts====
{{see also|Celtic headhunting}}
The [[Celts]] of western Europe long pursued a [[Celtic polytheism#Head hunting|"cult of the severed head"]], as evidenced by both Classical literary descriptions and archaeological contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Cunliffe|Cunliffe, Barry]] (2010), ''Druids: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]], pp 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; This cult played a central role in their temples and religious practices and earned them a reputation as [[Headhunting|head hunters]] among the Mediterranean peoples. [[Diodorus Siculus]], in his 1st-century ''History'' had this to say about Celtic head-hunting:
{{quote|They cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle and attach them to the necks of their horses. The blood-stained spoils they hand over to their attendants and striking up a paean and singing a song of victory; and they nail up these first fruits upon their houses, just as do those who lay low wild animals in certain kinds of hunting. They embalm in [[cedar oil]] the heads of the most distinguished enemies, and preserve them carefully in a chest, and display them with pride to strangers, saying that for this head one of their ancestors, or his father, or the man himself, refused the offer of a large sum of money. They say that some of them boast that they refused the weight of the head in gold.}}
Both the Greeks and Romans found the Celtic decapitation practices shocking and the latter put an end to them when Celtic regions came under their control. However, Greeks and Romans both employed decapitation and other horrific tortures, highlighting a tendency to view practices as more shocking when carried out by an outside group, even if the practices are essentially similar.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', pg 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Jacobsthal]], "Amongst the Celts the [[human head]] was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jacobsthal ''Early Celtic Art''&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments for a Celtic cult of the severed head include the many sculptured representations of severed heads in La Tène carvings, and the surviving Celtic mythology, which is full of stories of the severed heads of heroes and the saints who [[cephalophore|carry their own severed heads]], right down to ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', where the [[Green Knight]] picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off, just as [[Denis|St. Denis]] carried his head to the top of [[Montmartre]].

A further example of this regeneration after beheading lies in the tales of [[Connemara]]'s [[St. Feichin]], who after being beheaded by Viking pirates carried his head to the Holy Well on [[Omey Island]] and on dipping the head into the well placed it back upon his neck and was restored to full health.

The ancient Greeks and Romans regarded decapitation as a comparatively honorable form of execution for criminals. The traditional procedure, however, included first being tied to a stake and whipped with rods. Axes were used by the Romans, and later swords, which were considered a more honorable instrument of death. Those who could verify that they were Roman citizens were to be beheaded, rather than undergoing the much more horrific experience of [[crucifixion]]. In the [[Roman Republic]] of the early 1st century BC, it became the tradition for the severed heads of public enemies—such as the political opponents of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and [[Sulla]], for example—to be publicly displayed on the [[Rostra]] in the [[Forum Romanum]] after execution. Perhaps the most famous such victim was [[Cicero]] who, on instructions from [[Mark Antony]], had his hands (which had penned the ''[[Philippicae]]'' against Antony) and his head cut off and nailed up for display in this manner.

==== Germany ====
* [[Fritz Haarmann]], a serial killer from [[Hannover]] who was sentenced to death for killing 27 young men, was decapitated in April 1925. He was nicknamed "The Butcher from Hanover" and was rumored to have sold his victims' flesh to his neighbor's restaurant.
* In July 1931, notorious serial killer [[Peter Kürten]], known as "The Vampire of Düsseldorf", was executed on the guillotine in [[Cologne]].
* On 1 August 1933, in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Bruno Tesch (antifascist)|Bruno Tesch]] and three others were beheaded. These were the first executions in the [[Third Reich]]. The executions concerned the [[Altona Bloody Sunday]] (''Altonaer Blutsonntag'') riot, an [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] march on 17 July 1932 that turned violent and led to 18 people being shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asfpg.de/english/4763/17330.html|title=asfpg ~ Altonaer Stiftung für philosophische Grundlagenforschung|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/157552/The-Axe-of-Wandsbek/overview | work=The New York Times | title=Movies: About Das Beil Von Wandsbek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In February 1935 [[Benita von Falkenhayn]] and [[Renate von Natzmer]] were beheaded with the axe and block in [[Berlin]] for espionage for [[Poland]]. Axe beheading was the only method of execution in Berlin until 1938, when it was decreed that all civil executions would henceforth be carried out by guillotine. However, the practice was continued in rare cases such as that of [[Olga Bancic]] and [[Werner Seelenbinder]]&amp;nbsp;in 1944. Beheading by guillotine survived in West Germany until 1949 and in East Germany until 1966.
* A group of three Catholic clergymen, Johannes Prassek, Eduard Müller and Hermann Lange, and an Evangelical Lutheran pastor, Karl Friedrich Stellbrink, were arrested following the bombing of Lübeck, tried by the People's Court in 1943 and sentenced to death by decapitation; all were beheaded on 10 November 1943, in the Hamburg prison at Holstenglacis. Stellbrink had explained the raid next morning in his Palm Sunday sermon as a "trial by ordeal", which the Nazi authorities interpreted to be an attack on their system of government and as such undermined morale and aided the enemy.
* In October 1944, [[Werner Seelenbinder]]&amp;nbsp;was executed by manual beheading, the last legal use of the method (other than by guillotine) in Europe. Earlier the same year, [[Olga Bancic]]&amp;nbsp;had been executed by the same means.
* In February 1943, American academic [[Mildred Harnack]] and the university students [[Hans Scholl]], [[Sophie Scholl]], and [[Christoph Probst]] of the [[White Rose]] protest movement, were all beheaded by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi State]]. Four other members of the [[White Rose]], an anti-Nazi group, were also executed by the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] later that same year.  The anti-Nazi [[Helmuth Hübener]] was also decapitated by People’s Court order.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==== France ====
In France, until the abolition of capital punishment in 1981, the main method of execution had been by beheading by means of the [[guillotine]]. Other than a small number of military cases{{which|date=March 2014}} where a firing squad was used (including that of [[Jean Bastien-Thiry]]) the guillotine was the only legal method of execution from 1791, when it was introduced by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] during the last days of the kingdom [[French Revolution]], until 1981. Before the revolution, beheading had typically been reserved to noblemen and carried out manually. In 1981, President [[François Mitterrand]] abolished capital punishment and issued commutations for those whose sentences had not been executed.

The first person executed by the guillotine (in France) was highwayman [[Nicolas Jacques Pelletier]] in April 1792. The last execution was of murderer [[Hamida Djandoubi]], in Marseilles, in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Il y a 30 ans, avait lieu la dernière exécution |trans-title=Thirty years ago, the last execution took place |url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/20070910.OBS4158/il_y_a_30_ans_avait_lieula_derniere_execution.html |publisher=Le Nouvel Observateur |date=10 September 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2014 |language=FR}} ({{Google translation|en|fr|3=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/20070910.OBS4158/il_y_a_30_ans_avait_lieula_derniere_execution.html}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Djandoubi's execution was the last judicial use of the guillotine in the world.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Throughout its extensive [[overseas France|overseas colonies and dependencies]], the device was also used, including on [[St Pierre and Miquelon|St Pierre]] in 1889 and on [[Martinique]]&amp;nbsp;as late as 1965.&lt;ref&gt;http://grandcolombier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/zuzaregui.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nordic countries ====
In [[Nordic countries]], decapitation was the usual means of carrying out capital punishment. Noblemen were beheaded with a [[sword]], and commoners with an [[axe]]. The last executions by decapitation in [[Finland]] in 1825, [[Norway]] in 1876, [[Faroe Islands]] in 1609, and in [[Iceland]] in 1830 were carried out with axes. The same was the case in [[Denmark]] in 1892. [[Sweden]] continued the practice for a few decades, executing its second to last criminal – mass murderer [[Johan Filip Nordlund]] – by ax in 1900. It was replaced by the guillotine, which was used for the first and only time on [[Johan Alfred Ander]] in 1910.

Nordlund's execution was the last (legal) manual beheading in the Western world except for in Germany, where it prevailed until the days of [[World War II]] (see above).

The official beheading axe of Finland resides today in the Museum of Crime, [[Vantaa]].

==== Spain ====
In Spain executions were carried out by various methods including strangulation by the [[garrotte]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries, noblemen were sometimes executed by means of beheading. Examples include [[Anthony van Stralen, Lord of Merksem]], [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]] and [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn]]. They were tied to a chair on a scaffold. The executioner used a knife to cut the head from the body. It was considered to be a more honourable death if the executioner started with cutting the throat.&lt;ref&gt;Execution of the Marquess of Ayamonte on the 11th. of December 1645 Described in "Varios relatos diversos de Cartas de Jesuitas" (1634–1648) Coll.

==== Mexico ====
[[File:BeheadingPanelSBCTajin.JPG|thumb|Panel showing ballplayer being beheaded, [[Classic Veracruz culture]], Mexico]]

[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], [[Ignacio Allende]], [[José Mariano Jiménez]] and [[Juan Aldama]] were tried for treason, executed by [[firing squad]] and beheaded during the Mexican independence in 1811. Their heads were on display on the four corners of the [[Alhóndiga de Granaditas]], in [[Guanajuato]].

During the [[Mexican Drug War]], some Mexican drug cartels turned to decapitation and beheading of rival cartel members as a method of intimidation.&lt;ref name="Grayson"&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=George W.

==== United States ====

Beheading was used in mutilations of the dead, particularly of black people like [[Nat Turner]], who led a rebellion against slavery.  When caught, he was publicly hanged, flayed, and beheaded.  This was a technique used by many enslavers to discourage the "frequent bloody uprisings" that were carried out by "kidnapped Africans". While bodily dismemberment of various kinds was employed to instill terror, Dr. Erasmus D. Fenner noted postmortem decapitation was particularly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Washington|first1=Harriet A.|date=2006|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York. London. Toronto. Sydney. Austin.|page=126, paragraph 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/louisiana/articles/2017-07-28/old-south-grandeur-leavened-with-a-cold-look-at-slavery heads] of executed dissidents were sometimes displayed on pikes on the grounds of American slave labor camps.

US soldiers have committed decapitations in various invasions and/or conquests, including of the Native Americans, the Philippines, Korea, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boggs|first1=Carl|title=The Crimes of Empire|date=2010|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Vietnam, correspondent Michael Herr notes "thousands" of photo-albums made by US soldiers "all seemed to contain the same pictures": "the severed head shot, the head often resting on the chest of the dead man or being held up by a smiling Marine, or a lot of the heads, arranged in a row, with a burning cigarette in each of the mouths, the eyes open".  Some of the victims were "very young".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turse|first1=Nick|title=Kill Anything that Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam|date=2013|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General George S. Patton III, son of the famous WWII general, was known for keeping "macabre souvenirs", such as "a Vietnamese skull that sat on his desk."  Other Americans "hacked the heads off Vietnamese to keep, trade, or exchange for prizes offered by commanders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turse|first1=Nick|title=Kill Anything that Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam|date=2013|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a terror tactic, "some American troops hacked the heads off... dead [Vietnamese] and mounted them on pikes or poles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turse|first1=Nick|title=Kill Anything that Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam|date=2013|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Utah Territory]] permitted a person sentenced to death to choose beheading as a means of execution, no person chose that option, and it was dropped when [[Utah]] became a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Wilbur R. |title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia |year=2012 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=9781412988766 |oclc=768569594 |page=1856 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYME6Z35nyAC&amp;pg=PA1856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle East ===
==== Saudi Arabia ====
{{See also|Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia has a criminal justice system based on a hardline and literal form of [[Shari'ah]] law reflecting a particular state-sanctioned interpretation of Islam. Crimes such as rape, murder, apostasy, and sorcery.&lt;ref name="BBCexecutioner2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2966790.stm|title=Saudi executioner tells all|date=5 June 2003|accessdate=11 July 2011|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; are punishable by beheading.&lt;ref name="saudibehead2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-177028385/sword-of-justice-beheadings-rise-in-saudi-arabia|title=Sword of Justice? Beheadings Rise in Saudi Arabia|author=Weinberg, Jon|date=Winter 2008|publisher=Harvard International Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually carried out [[Public execution|publicly]] by beheading with a sword. 

A public beheading will typically take place around 9am. The convicted person is walked into the square and kneels in front of the executioner. The executioner uses a sword to remove the condemned person's head from his or her body at the neck with a single strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde23/004/1993/en/|title=DOCUMENT - SAUDI ARABIA: AN UPSURGE IN PUBLIC EXECUTIONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the convicted person is pronounced dead, a police official announces the crimes committed by the beheaded alleged criminal and the process is complete. The official might announce the same before the actual execution.  This is the most common method of execution in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/justice-sword-saudi-arabias-embrace-death-penalty-780819|title=Justice By The Sword: Saudi Arabia's Embrace Of The Death Penalty|date=2012-09-11|publisher=Ibtimes.com|accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], at least 79 people were executed in the kingdom in 2013.&lt;ref name="AIExecutions2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/act500012014en.pdf | title=Death Sentences and Executions 2013 | publisher=Amnesty International | date=2014 | accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners are not exempt, accounting for "almost half" of executions in 2013.&lt;ref name="AIExecutions2013"/&gt;

==== Iraq ====
[[File:Assyrian military campaign in southern Mesopotamia, beheaded enemies, 7th century BC, from Nineveh, Iraq. The British Museum.jpg|thumb|Assyrian military campaign in southern Mesopotamia, beheaded enemies, 7th century BC, from Nineveh, Iraq. The British Museum]]
Though not officially sanctioned, legal beheadings were carried out against at least 50 prostitutes and pimps under [[Saddam Hussein]] as late as 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10190019.ab|title= Saddam halshögg 50 prostituerade |publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beheadings have emerged as another [[terrorism|terror]] tactic especially in Iraq since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/movies/14TERROR.html|title=The Terrorist as Auteur|first=Michael|last=Ignatieff|date=14 November 2004|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017|via=NYTimes.com|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilians have borne the brunt of the beheadings, although U.S. and Iraqi military personnel have also been targeted. After kidnapping the victim, the kidnappers typically make some sort of demand of the government of the hostage's nation and give a time limit for the demand to be carried out, often 72 hours. Beheading is often threatened if the government fails to heed the wishes of the hostage takers. Sometimes, the [[beheading video|beheadings are videotaped]] and made available on the Internet.  One of the most publicized of such executions was that of [[Nick Berg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=299_1320002757|title=LiveLeak.com – Nick Berg ( Died )|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judicial execution is practiced in Iraq, but is generally carried out by [[hanging]].

====Syria====
The Syrian Government employs hanging as its method of capital punishment. However, the terrorist organisation known as the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], which controlled territory in much of eastern Syria, had regularly carried out beheadings of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syrian Rebels used a child to behead a prisoner |url =http://humanrightsinvestigations.org/2012/12/10/syrian-rebels-use-a-child-to-behead-a-prisoner/|publisher=Human Rights Investigation |date=12 December 2012 |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rebels" and/or terrorists known to be part of the "US-vetted alliance" of armed militias attempting to overthrow the Syrian government have [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/syrian-opposition-group-which-killed-child-was-in-us-vetted-alliance also] been implicated in beheadings.

Natural and man-made '''disasters''' tend to have a disproportionate impact on people with '''disabilities'''. This issue is recognised and addressed by Article 11 of the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"States Parties shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/disabilities-convention.htm#11 |title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |publisher=.ohchr.org |date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Research==
There is limited research knowledge, but many anecdotal reports, on what happens when disasters impact people with [[disabilities]].&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdra.colostate.edu/Data/Sites/1/cdra-research/peek-stough2010.pdf |title=Children With Disabilities in the Context of Disaster: A Social Vulnerability Perspective |publisher=Child Development |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512111637/http://cdra.colostate.edu/Data/Sites/1/cdra-research/peek-stough2010.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rep-55-3-211.pdf |title=Disaster Case Management and Individuals With Disabilities |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with disabilities may be greatly affected by natural disasters.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheEffects"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stough |first=Laura M. |editor1-first=Yuval |editor1-last=Neria |editor2-first=Sandro |editor2-last=Galea |editor3-first=Fran H. |editor3-last=Norris |title=Mental Health and Disasters |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2009 |pages=264–276 |chapter=Chapter 15: The Effects of Disaster on the Mental Health of Individuals with Disabilities |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511730030.015 |isbn=9780511730030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with physical disabilities can be at risk when evacuating if assistance is not available. Individuals with [[cognitive impairments]] may struggle with understanding instructions that must be followed in the event a disaster occurs.&lt;ref name="TheEffects" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
Some research studies have found discrimination against individuals with disabilities during all phases of the disaster cycle.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt; The most common limitation is that people cannot [[Accessibility|physically access]] buildings or [[transport]], as well as access disaster-related services.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt; The exclusion of these individuals is caused in part by the lack of disability-related training provided to emergency planners and [[disaster relief]] personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1546 |title=UN Enable - Disability, natural disasters and emergency situations |publisher=Un.org |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2013-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202131058/http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1546 |archivedate=2013-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disability in disaster management planning==
Disability as a factor in [[disaster planning]] is an issue that is receiving attention from some disaster management jurisdictions while various [[disability rights]] organizations are active in lobbying and education efforts for authorities to include the needs of disabled members of the public in their planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://practicalaction.org/janthakshana_disabilitysensitivity |title=Disability sensitivity in disaster management |publisher=Practical Action |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handicap-international.fr/fileadmin/documents/publications/DisasterRiskReduc.pdf |title=Mainstreaming Disability into Disaster Risk Reduction: A Training Manual |publisher=Handicap International |accessdate=2013-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908082804/http://www.handicap-international.fr/fileadmin/documents/publications/DisasterRiskReduc.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napas.org/en/issues/disaster-management.html |title=Disaster Management |publisher=Napas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jagger, Jessica Carol |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/34/53/3453987.html |title=ProQuest Document View - Disaster Management Policy and People with Disabilities in the United States and Jamaica |publisher=Gradworks.umi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) has influenced initiatives like The Sphere Project to include more disability related guidelines and recognise the different approaches required for different disabilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stough|first=Laura M.|date=2015-06-01|title=World Report on Disability, Intellectual Disabilities, and Disaster Preparedness: Costa Rica as a Case Example|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jppi.12116/abstract|journal=Journal of Policy and Practice in Intellectual Disabilities|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=138–146|doi=10.1111/jppi.12116|issn=1741-1130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rural and lower income countries and areas, there is a gap between those who need financial and human resources and those who need it, thus those with disability do not receive the services that they need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=61a6a727-9497-4f25-8456-5cac05660a8a@sessionmgr101|title=The 2015 Nepal Earthquake(s): Lessons Learned From the Disability and Rehab...: Discover|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7108">'''War reparations of Finland to the Soviet Union''' were originally worth US$300,000,000 at 1938 prices. Finland agreed to pay the reparations in the [[Moscow Armistice]] signed on 19 September 1944.  The protocol to determine more precisely the war reparations to the Soviet Union was signed in December 1944, by the prime minister [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]] and the chairman of the [[Allied Control Commission (Finland)|Allied Control Commission]] for controlling the [[Moscow Armistice]] in Helsinki, [[Andrei Zhdanov]].

Finland was originally obliged to pay $300,000,000 in gold to be paid in the form of ships and machinery, over six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7F1PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4694,38599&amp;dq=finland+shipbuilding+industry&amp;hl=en |title= Russia To Get Last Payment From Finland|work=news.google.ca |date= 1952-09-01|accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ch0yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=puQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6415,226319&amp;dq=finland+shipbuilding+industry&amp;hl=en |title= Finland Outpost of Coexistance|first= Leon|last= Hughes|work= Ottawa Citizen|date= 1961-01-04|accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union agreed to prolong the payment period from six to eight years in late 1945. In summer 1948 the sum was cut to $226,500,000. The last dispatched train of the deliveries paying the war reparations crossed the border between Finland and the Soviet Union on 18 September 1952, in [[Vainikkala]] railway border station.  Approximately 340,000 railroad carloads were needed to deliver all reparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&amp;g=1&amp;ag=3&amp;t=69&amp;a=4558|title=Suomen sotakorvaukset|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authority responsible for deliveries, and also organising production agreements with the manufacturers according to the protocols, was Sotakorvausteollisuuden valtuuskunta, the delegation of the war reparations industry. The preliminary committee was established on 9 October 1944. It was chaired by the [[vuorineuvos|mining counselor]] [[Walter Gräsbeck]], with [[Jaakko Rautanen]] as secretary, and [[Gunnar Jaatinen]], [[Juho Jännes]], [[Johan Nykopp]], [[Arno Solin]], and [[Wilhelm Wahlforss]] as members.

For delivering the needed amount of the wooden houses to the Soviet Union, a joint venture, [[Puutalo (company)|Puutalo Oy]], was established. The last delivery of wooden houses took place on 28 January 1948. The deliveries started on 22 December 1944. Altogether the floor area of the delivered wooden houses was 840,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The war reparation itself contributed 177,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as compensation for the German property, which Finland did not hand over to the Soviet Union. This consisted of 37,208 railway wagons, which as a single train would have been 335&amp;nbsp;km long.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pateniemiseura.net/node/74|title=Pateniemiseura.net|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306125427/http://pateniemiseura.net/node/74|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Flagellation]] of Christ''', sometimes known as '''Christ at the Column''' or the '''Scourging at the Pillar''', is a scene from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] very frequently shown in [[Christian art]], in cycles of the Passion or the larger subject of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]''.  It is the fourth station of the modern alternate [[Stations of the Cross]], and a Sorrowful Mystery of the [[Rosary]].&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of visual art, Volume 4'' by Lawrence Gowing 1983, Ency Brittanica, page 626&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolton &gt;''Old Master Paintings and Drawings'' by Roy Bolton 2009 {{ISBN|1-907200-01-0}} page 70&lt;/ref&gt; The column to which Christ is normally tied, and the rope, [[scourge]], whip or birch are elements in the [[Arma Christi]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iconography of Christian Art: The Passion of Christ'' by Gertrud Schiller 1972 ASIN: B000KGWGH4 pages 66-68&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Santa Prassede|Basilica di Santa Prassede]] in Rome claims to possess the original column.&lt;ref&gt;Which is still [[:File:Monti - santa Prassede colonna flagellazione 01396.JPG|in situ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 15th century the subject is also painted in individual works, rather than as one of a series of Passion scenes. The most-discussed single work is the [[Flagellation of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|enigmatic treatment]] on a small panel in [[Urbino]] by [[Piero della Francesca]] (1455–60), whose precise meaning has eluded generations of art historians.  At the same time '''Christ at the Column''' or '''Christ at the Stake''' developed as an image of Christ alone tied to a column or stake. This was most popular in [[Baroque]] sculpture, and also related to the subject, not found in the canonical Gospels, of '''Christ in the Dungeon'''. It is often difficult to distinguish between these two, and between ''Christ at the Column'' and a ''Flagellation''.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of the Flagellation]], at the supposed site in Jerusalem, was rebuilt in 1839 and again in 1929.

==Gospels==
Flagellation at the hands of the Romans is mentioned in three of the four [[canonical Gospel]]s: [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019:1;&amp;version=31; John 19:1], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%2015:15;&amp;version=31; Mark 15:15], and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027:26;&amp;version=31; Matthew 27:26], and was the usual prelude to [[crucifixion]] under [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 66; [http://europe.newsweek.com/how-romans-used-crucifixion-including-jesus-political-weapon-318934 Academic in ''Newsweek'']&lt;/ref&gt;  None of three accounts are more detailed than John's "Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged" (NIV). Luke's comparable account, [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2022:63-22:65;&amp;version=31; Luke 22:63-65] is of the High Priest's guards beating and mocking Jesus.  In the Passion of Christ the episode precedes the [[Mocking of Christ]] and the [[Crown of thorns|Crowning with thorns]], which the Gospels happened at the same time or immediately after.  Unlike the flogging, these were not part of the normal Roman judicial process.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
It first appears in art in the West in the 9th century. It is almost never found in [[Byzantine art]], and remains very rare in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] art at any date. Initially found in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and small ivories, there are surviving monumental wall-paintings from around 1000 in Italy. From the start there are most often three figures, Christ and two servants of [[Pontius Pilate]] who whip him. In early depictions Christ may be naked, or wearing a long robe, facing out or seen from behind; from the 12th century it is standard that Christ wears a loincloth ([[Perizoma (loincloth)|perizoma]]) and faces out towards the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;  Christ's face is normally visible, giving artists the "technical problem of showing him receiving the strokes on his back - the usual place - while at the same time leaving his face visible.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', 123, 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often he appears to be receiving the strokes on the front of his body.

[[Pontius Pilate]] is sometimes shown watching the scene, and his wife's servant may approach him with [[Pontius Pilate's wife|her message]], and in the later Middle Ages, probably under the influence of [[Passion play]]s, the number of men beating Christ may be three or four, increasingly caricatured in the North as grotesque figures in the dress of contemporary mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller,68&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes another figure, who may be [[Herod the Great|Herod]], is present. The Flagellation was at the hands of those working for Pontius Pilate, but the floggers may sometimes wear [[Jewish hat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Schiller fig. 231, a 13th-century wall-painting from Cologne&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]] of [[Duccio]], the scene may take place in public, before an audience of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Franciscan]]s, who promoted self-flagellation as a means of identification with the suffering of Christ, were probably responsible for a number of large Italian processional crosses in which the Flagellation occupies the back of the cross, with a Crucifixion on the front. These were presumably sometimes followed in processions by flagellants, who could see Christ suffering in front of them.&lt;ref name="Schiller, 67"&gt;Schiller, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Death of Jesus}}

==In film==
In modern times, filmmakers have depicted Christ being flogged. It is a significant scene in [[Mel Gibson]]'s [[2004 in film|2004]] ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. In Kubrick's ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', Alex imagines himself as a Roman soldier flogging Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/nocturnal/33.html |title=The Passion of the Christ |author=D.K.

== FMFA 2012 ==

The festival began in 2012 as a one-day music festival at the '''[[Sepang International Circuit]]''', featuring a mix of local and international acts. The inaugural event was officiated by Dato' Sri Dr. Ng Yen Yen, Malaysia's Tourism Minister at that time. The festival claimed to have seen an attendance of over 20,000 people from Malaysia and across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Went Down: Future Music Festival Asia @ Sepang International Circuit|url= http://www.juiceonline.com/what-went-down-future-music-festival-asia-sepang-international-circuit/|publisher=JUICEOnline.com |date= 23 March 2012 |accessdate= 26 Feb 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[ship prefix|GTS]] ''Finnjet''''' was a [[cruiseferry]], built in 1977 by [[Wärtsilä]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki Shipyard]], Finland for [[Finnlines]] traffic between Finland and Germany. At the time of her delivery, ''Finnjet'' was the fastest, longest and largest car ferry in the world, and the only one powered by [[gas turbine]]s. At the point of her scrapping in 2008, she remained the fastest conventional ferry in the world, with a recorded top speed of {{convert|33.5|kn}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finnjetweb.com/en/fakten/reco.htm|title='Finnjet''s Records |publisher=Finnjetweb |accessdate=14 September 2008|quote=fastest conventional ferry of the world (1977–1994; 1994–2001; 2001– ), {{convert|31|kn}}; {{convert|33|kn}} [..] since May 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Finnjet'' had remained out of service since 2005, laid up in [[Baton Rouge]], [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]] and [[Genoa]].

==Overview==

''Finnjet'' was built by [[Wärtsilä]] at the [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki Shipyard]] (Build-No. 407) in Helsinki, Finland and delivered to [[Enso-Gutzeit]] to serve in their subsidiary [[Finnlines]].&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronicle" /&gt; The ship was built specifically for the route between [[Helsinki]] in Finland and [[Travemünde]] in [[West Germany]] which Finnlines had previously trafficked with slower conventional ferries.&lt;ref name="FoF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronicle" /&gt; The gas turbine engines combination gave a top speed of {{convert|31|kn|km/h}},&lt;ref name="Speed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finnjetweb.com/en/fakten/speed.htm |title='Finnjet''s Speed |accessdate=23 September 2007 |last=Saken |first=Mathias |work=Finnjetweb }}&lt;/ref&gt; a one-way crossing was planned to take only 22 hours for the ship. At the time [[Travemünde]] was the closest port to Finland in mainland [[Western Europe]], being located in the Federal German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] just west of the border with [[East Germany]].

In addition to being the largest and fastest ship of her time, ''Finnjet'' is also widely considered to have been the first genuine [[cruiseferry]]. Her cabins were very much ahead of their time for a ferry, it was not until over a decade later when other ferries would match the size and fittings of ''Finnjet'' 's cabins. Her restaurants and other services were also superior to other ferries of her time. ''Finnjet'' 's influence can be clearly seen on the first genuine cruiseferries built for Finland–Sweden traffic in 1980–81, ships such as [[MS Viking Song|MS ''Viking Song'']], [[MS Viking Sally|MS ''Viking Sally'']] and [[MS Finlandia|MS ''Finlandia'']].

Partially due to being such a ground-breaking ship, ''Finnjet'' was also extremely prestigious, which helps explain why she remained in traffic on the [[Baltic Sea]] for such a long time even though she was often unprofitable. Famous Finnish painter [[Kimmo Kaivanto]] provided paintings and drawings to decorate the ship, and he even designed a ''Finnjet'' medallion to commemorate the ship's commission. Kaivanto's main work for the ship, the three-deck high ''Pictures of Finland'', was given to the Finnish Maritime Museum in 2007, destined for display in the museum from 2008 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tallinksilja.com/fi/mainMenu/company/news/PicturesOfFinland.htm |title=Tallink Silja on lahjoittanut Kimmo Kaivannon Suomalaisia kuvia -teoksen Suomen Merimuseolle |accessdate=14 May 2007 |date=14 May 2007 |work=Tallink Silja press release |publisher=Tallink Silja |language=Finnish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210059/http://www.tallinksilja.com/fi/mainMenu/company/news/PicturesOfFinland.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 a [[7" single]], Finnjet Waltz, was recorded in honour of the ship, and she was the first ship ever to have a [[Lego]] model of her for sale on board. As late as the early 1990s Silja Line still considered ''Finnjet'' to be one of their greatest ships, and in their brochures she appeared right after the brand-new Helsinki–[[Stockholm]] ferries, ahead of many ships that were both newer and larger than ''Finnjet'' herself was. ''Finnjet'' still remains the best-known individual ship in Finland. She also has a very good reputation in Germany still, and recently (August 2006) Silja Line's new owners [[Tallink]] went on record considering adapting the name 'Finnjet' for their Finland–Germany ferries (to the dismay of ferry enthusiasts in Finland and Germany).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siljaweb.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=36 Finnjetweb forums – Finnjet II? (Superfast renamings)]. Retrieved 21 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However ''Finnjet'' is a registered trademark of Finnlines (until 2017) and therefore Tallink could not go ahead with their plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{fi icon}} [http://tavaramerkki.prh.fi/ice-bin/oiice.dll/ca-ice/html/rekisterinrob.html?p_kanta=tuotanto&amp;p_userid=vallatonv&amp;p_lisays=1&amp;p_lisaystoisto=ei&amp;p_reknumero=66235&amp;p_jaktunnus= Finnish Trademark Register] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720192044/http://tavaramerkki.prh.fi/ice-bin/oiice.dll/ca-ice/html/rekisterinrob.html?p_kanta=tuotanto&amp;p_userid=vallatonv&amp;p_lisays=1&amp;p_lisaystoisto=ei&amp;p_reknumero=66235&amp;p_jaktunnus= |date=20 July 2011 }}.

==Concept and construction==

In the beginning of the 1970s a study was made about the future development of passenger numbers on the ferry service between Finland and West Germany. The study projected notable growth, with 300,000 to 800,000 passenger projected to make a crossing in 1980, with the likeliest number projected at 500,000. At the time Finnlines and [[Finland Steamship Company]] were maintaining a joint service on the route with two ships built during the latter half of the 1960s ({{MS|Finnhansa|1966}} and {{MS|Finlandia|1967}}, respectively), both capable of transporting a maximum of 100,000 passengers per year. Based on the estimates made [[Enso-Gutzeit]], one of the owners of Finnlines, begun planning a new, larger and faster ferry for the service. Initial plans made in 1971 called for a ship with 800 passenger berths (the ''Finnhansa'' had only 300 at the time), but these were abandoned in favour of an even larger ship.&lt;ref name=Karonen&gt;{{cite book |title=Enso-Gutzeit Oy laivanvarustajana: Oy Finnlines Ltd ja Merivienti Oy 1947–1982 |last=Karonen |first=Petri |year=1992 |publisher=Enso-Gutzeit |location=Imatra |isbn=952-9690-00-2 |pages=106–109 |url= |language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans for the new ship, codenamed ''Finnjet'',&lt;ref name=FoF /&gt; were developed within the next two years.&lt;ref name=Karonen /&gt;

Project ''Finnjet'' was developed into a much larger ship than the ''Finnhansa'' or ''Finlandia''. ''Finnjet'' was to have 1,500 passenger berths and the ship would be powered by two [[gas turbine]]s instead of the traditional [[diesel engine]]s. Gas turbines she would give a service speed of {{convert|30.5|kn}} (compared to the {{convert|20|kn}} of the ''Finnhansa''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/finnhansa_1966.htm |title=M/S ''Finnhansa'' (1966) |accessdate=6 December 2008 |last=Asklander |first=Micke |work=Fakta om Fartyg |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;), making it possible to cut the passage time between Helsinki and [[Travemünde]] from 36 hours to just 22 hours. Advanced loading systems developed for the ship meant her port turnaround time would be just two hours. These factors combined meant that ''Finnjet'' would have a yearly passenger capacity of over 300,000.&lt;ref name=Karonen /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronicle 1973-12-05"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finnjetweb.com/en/fakten/051273.htm |title=''Finnjet'' Chronicle: In-depth information 5 December 1973 |accessdate=6 December 2008 |last=Kaukiainen |first=Salomon |work=Finnjetweb }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a temporary measure to cover for the rising passenger numbers [[Thomesto Oy]], another member of the Finnlines consortium, purchased the 1966-built {{MS|Finnpartner|1973}} and placed it in Finnlines traffic in 1973.&lt;ref name=Karonen /&gt; On 5 December 1973 Enso-Gutzeit placed an order for project ''Finnjet'' with the [[Wärtsilä]] [[Hietalahti shipyard]] in [[Helsinki]], Finland. The cost of the ship has been estimated at being between 200–300 million [[Finnish markka]],&lt;ref name=FoF /&gt;&lt;ref name=Karonen /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronicle 1973-12-05" /&gt; making her the largest investment made to Finnish tourism by that time.&lt;ref name="Chronicle 1973-12-05" /&gt; At the time ''Finnjet'' was in fact planned as the first in a pair of identical sisters. The build contract included an option for a second vessel that was offered to the Finland Steamship Company as a part of the joint service agreement between Finland SS Co and Finnlines, but Finland SS Co decided not to utilise the option.&lt;ref name=Haavikko&gt;{{cite book |title=Vuosisadan merikirja: Effoan sata ensimmäistä vuotta 1883–1983 |last=Haavikko |first=Paavo |year=1983 |publisher=Effoa |location=Helsinki |isbn=951-99438-1-1 |pages=120 |url= |language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following further refining of the plans to the ship by the shipyard,&lt;ref name="Chronicle 1973-12-05" /&gt; the keel of Project ''Finnjet'' was laid on 20 May 1975. In a traditional ceremony, coins were thrown onto the keel to wish the ship good luck. These coins were then welded on the keel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finnjetweb.com/en/fakten/200575.htm |title=''Finnjet'' Chronicle: In-depth information 20 May 1975 |accessdate=6 December 2008 |last=Kaukiainen |first=Salomon |work=Finnjetweb }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1975 it was clear that the growth predictions based on which the plans of ''Finnjet'' had been made had been overtly positive.&lt;ref name=Karonen /&gt; At the time Finnlines and Finland Steamship Company were negotiating the formation of a joint subsidiary for their cargo-carrying operations.&lt;ref name="Haavikko" /&gt; To ensure the success of ''Finnjet'', Enso-Gutzeit and Finnlines were eager to induce Finland Steamship Company to withdraw from the Finland–Germany passenger services completely. This was successful, and as a part of the agreement of forming [[Finncarriers]] as a joint subsidiary of Finnlines and Finland Steamship Company the latter withdrew from the Finland–Germany passenger service, selling their ''Finlandia'' to Finnlines (in exchange for the ro-ro freighter {{MS|Finncarrier}}).&lt;ref name="Karonen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haavikko" /&gt;

The construction of ''Finnjet'' was not without mishaps, as on 24 March 1976 a fire broke out in the [[bow thruster]] room but was quickly brought under control. On 28 March 1976 the ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] from drydock without ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Chronicle" /&gt; As "Finnjet" was only a working name given to the ship, other names were considered by Enso-Gutzeit as the final name of the vessel. Naming the ship after [[Urho Kekkonen]], [[President of Finland|President of the Republic of Finland]] at the time, was considered.&lt;ref name="Karisto"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karisto |first=Ilkka |date=April 2008 |title=Palaa kotiin oi muistojemme ''Finnjet'' |journal=Helsingin Sanomat Kuukausiliite |pages=58–65 |url=http://www.hs.fi/ilmainen/kuukausiliite/juhlanumero2008/index.html |accessdate=6 December 2008 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the project name ''Finnjet'' was chosen as the official name of the ship.

Coinciding with the work done on the ship itself work was carried out in the [[Port of Helsinki]] in order to accommodate the large ship. The [[Kustaanmiekka]] strait leading to [[Helsinki South Harbour]] had to be widened so that ''Finnjet'' could safely sail through it.&lt;ref name=Karisto /&gt; A former warehouse at [[Katajanokka]], Helsinki was rebuilt as a ferry terminal that would be exclusively used by ''Finnjet'' (today the same terminal is used by [[Viking Line]]).

''Finnjet'' undertook her first test-drive between 9 and 12 December 1976.&lt;ref name="Chronicle" /&gt; Testing the gas turbines of the ship revealed that the original hull structure could not withstand the water pressure caused by the {{convert|30.5|kn}} service speed, and on returning to the shipyard various parts of the ship had to be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;Karonen. pp. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 1977 the ship sailed from Helsinki to [[Kiel]] in Germany, where she was drydocked and her bottom painted. On the return voyage from Kiel she also visited Travemünde for the first time. The second test cruise of the ship was carried out on 14 March 1977.&lt;ref name="Chronicle" /&gt; On 28 April 1977 ''Finnjet'' was delivered to Finnlines in a ceremony at the Finnjet terminal in Katajanokka, Helsinki. The ship was officially christened as a part of the same ceremony by [[Annikki Mattila]], the wife of Enso-Gutzeit CEO [[Olavi J. Mattila]]. The actual christening ceremony took place on the car deck of the ship.&lt;ref name="Chronicle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finnjetweb.com/en/fakten/280477.htm |title=''Finnjet'' Chronicle: In-depth information 28 April 1977 |accessdate=6 December 2008 |last=Kaukiainen |first=Salomon |work=Finnjetweb }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
{{More footnotes|section|date=December 2008}}

===1977–1987===
The ''Finnjet''{{'}}s maiden voyage was originally scheduled to depart from Helsinki on 1 May 1977. However, this was delayed due to an engine officers' strike. Finally the ship left on her maiden voyage on 13 May 1977, after a final turbine test drive had been carried out on 12 May 1977.&lt;ref name="Chronicle" /&gt;

''Finnjet''{{'}}s estimated fuel consumption for the 22-hour travel time was 300&amp;nbsp;tonnes of fuel; approx 350,000&amp;nbsp;litres total or 16,000&amp;nbsp;litres per hour.  Initially ''Finnjet'' was not a very profitable ship and after only a few years of service there were rumours that she would be sold. The ship had been ordered in the same year as the beginning of the [[1973 oil crisis]], which reached its peak around the time of the ship's launch. Yet another huge leap of the oil price occurred near the turn of the decade. To increase her profitability, the ship was converted to a [[combined diesel-electric and gas]] propulsion with the addition of diesel-[[electric generator]]s in 1981 in [[Amsterdamse Droogdok Maatschappij]], Amsterdam. The change allowed to operate the ship at slower speeds, using cheaper fuel during the winter months. On the way to the shipyard she became the largest ship to have passed through the [[Kiel Canal]] at that time. A year later 75% of ''Finnjet''{{'}}s shares were sold to [[Effoa]] (one of the owners of [[Silja Line]]), and Finnjet Line was established as a joint venture of Finnlines and Effoa to operate the Finnjet. Starting from November 1985, ''Finnjet'' made 24-hour (later 22-hour) backtracking cruises from Helsinki during the winter season. The final batch of these cruises in October–December 1995 included a short stop in [[Tallinn]]. In January 1986 another major renovation was carried out at Wärtsilä Helsinki, with new Commodore-class cabins added in place of the old sundeck. Shortly after the refit the Denmark-based [[DFDS]] made an offer to buy the ''Finnjet'', but the offer was refused. Instead, in June of the same year Finnlines sold their remaining shares of the ''Finnjet'' to Effoa. In the beginning of 1987 the ship was painted in Silja Line's colors and incorporated in Silja's fleet. However, the technical responsibility for operating the ''Finnjet'' remained with Finnlines until May 1989 (this was of little consequence as Finnlines was almost entirely owned by Effoa at the time).

===1987–2005===
[[File:Finnjet Kustaanmiekka.webm|thumb|GTS Finnjet passing through the strait Kustaanmiekka near Helsinki.]]
After the ship had become a part of the Silja Line fleet, further renovations at [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft]] Kiel (HDW) in 1987, 1988 and 1989 saw almost all of the ship's public spaces rebuilt. In 1990 Effoa merged with its fellow Silja Line partner [[Johnson Line]] to form [[EffJohn]]. In 1991 an extremely large-scale reconstruction was planned, where the ship would have been lengthened by {{convert|20|m|ft}}, cabins enlarged, a new outdoor swimming pool added, and much of the superstructure built to a sleeker appearance. Unfortunately the plan proved to be too costly and was abandoned; the funds that had been raised for this reconstruction went to the rebuilding of [[MS Svea|MS ''Svea'']] and [[MS Wellamo|MS ''Wellamo'']] into ''Silja Karneval'' and ''Silja Festival''.

Starting from 1992 Finnjet was used to monitor surface-layer chlorophyll, temperature and salinity in waters she sailed through for research by the [[Finnish Institute of Marine Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.fimr.fi/project/algaline/algali1.htm Phytoplankton Blooms in the Baltic Sea in 1994] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024918/http://www4.fimr.fi/project/algaline/algali1.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A new transmission system installed in 1994 (again at HDW Kiel) raised the top speed to {{convert|33|kn|km/h}} and allowed for a mixed operation of turbines and diesel engines.&lt;ref name="Speed" /&gt; September of the same year [[MS Estonia|MS ''Estonia'']], Finnjet's former fleetmate, sank during a heavy storm on the North Baltic. Finnjet was amongst the ferries used to search for survivors on the disaster area but she had to leave soon when cars carried on her upper cardeck started moving in the heavy seas, creating another potentially dangerous situation. In 1997 Finnjet was docked at [[Götaverken]] [[Cityvarvet]], [[Gothenburg]] and rebuilt with a larger tax-free shop in preparation for her new itenaries where she served on the Helsinki–Travemünde route only during the summer months, the rest of the year sailing on the Helsinki–Tallinn route. Originally the port in Tallinn was [[Port of Muuga|Muuga]], but when the ship-way of [[Tallinn Passenger Port|Tallinn's old harbour]] was reconstructed in 1998, Finnjet moved there from the start of January 1999. Between 1997 and 2000 segments for the Finnish comedy series Huuliveikot were shot on board the Finnjet.

In 1999 the summer-route was altered to Helsinki–Tallinn–[[Rostock]]. In autumn of the same year the Finnish Institute of Marine Research installed new equipment for monitoring water quality and algae. In 2001 the ship was docked with modifications made to the turbines and propeller shaft. These and a new bottom paint allowed her to increase her top speed once more, to {{convert|33.5|kn}}.&lt;ref name="Speed" /&gt; In mid-May 2002, only a few days after Finnjet's 25th anniversary cruise, Finnish newspaper [[Helsingin Sanomat]] reported the ship was for sale. At the time the information was thought to be false but later reports indicate the Finland-based [[Eckerö Line]] did consider buying her around that time. In April 2004 Finnjet called in Helsinki for the last time, after which she left for another refit at [[Aker Finnyards]] [[Rauma shipyard]] in preparation for her new [[Saint Petersburg]] – Tallinn – Rostock route. During the refit most of her interiors were entirely rebuilt, new rudders were installed and bridge wings covered. The new route was believed to be profitable all year round, but this proved not to be the case. After the first summer season Finnjet was laid up for the winter 2004/2005. The route was eventually terminated after the 2005 summer season, and the ship was put up for sale.

===2005–2008===

During the winter of 2005–2006, ''Finnjet'' was chartered to the faculty of medicine of [[Louisiana State University|Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans]] to provide housing to students, faculty, and staff displaced by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. She was moored on the west bank of the [[Mississippi River]] across from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], at the base of the [[Horace Wilkinson Bridge]].

On 6 June 2006, at the end of her charter, ''Finnjet'' left Baton Rouge for [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport, in the Bahamas]]. At the same time her ownership passed from Silja Line to their (then-)parent company Sea Containers. The ship had all [[Silja Line]] markings painted over and was reflagged from Finnish to Bahamian registry. During the following months, several rumours surfaced about the future use of the ship. These included a sale to a [[Florida]]-based company as a casino-ship,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnjetweb.com/en/news/index.htm Finnjetweb news, 3 August 2006].

On 16 January 2008 she was officially renamed ''Da Vinci'', and sailed to the [[T.

On 6 May 2008 she left Genoa for [[Jeddah]] in Saudi Arabia, where she was turned over to her new owners in mid-May.&lt;ref name=HSscrap /&gt; The ship was then renamed ''MV Kingdom''.

==Rescue efforts and recycling 2008–2009==

During May 2008 ''Finnjet'''s chief designer [[Martin Saarikangas]] led an effort to purchase Finnjet as a housing vessel for the Finnish cities [[Espoo]] or [[Turku]]. After these plans were deemed unfeasible, further efforts took place to find a new operator for ''Finnjet''.&lt;ref name="FHStime"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finnjet.fi/en/articles/25-general-reference/63-gts-finnjet-timeline-of-key-events-v1-2 |title=GTS Finnjet – Timeline of Key Events v.1.2.|accessdate=30 June 2014 |work=Finnjet Historical Society ry}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Finnjet's'' original builder in [[Helsinki]] offered assistance in reconditioning or converting the vessel to a new buyer's required standards. A potential [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] buyer for the vessel was turned away when a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] entrepreneur foiled the work of Saarikangas. "''Finnjet'' is lost", Martin Saarikangas declared and withdrew.
&lt;ref name="FHStime"/&gt;

The ship arrived at the scrapyard in [[Alang]], India on Friday, 13 June 2008. On Thursday, 19 June the ship was beached at Plot 109 of the Alang scrapyard. Although partially beached, scrapping did not start immediately, when an international lobby group initiated by former ''Finnjet'' passenger [[Risto Kempas]] managed to negotiate a halt into the breaking at the [[Rishi Ship Breaker's]] facility. The fine overall condition of the vessel had impressed the breaker into considering of the ship having more value if returned to traffic.&lt;ref name="FHSchairgreet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finnjet.fi/modules/content/index.php?id=7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181412/http://finnjet.fi/modules/content/index.php?id=7|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 July 2011|title=Finnjet Historical Society ry – Chairman's greetings|accessdate=28 October 2009|work=Finnjet Historical Society ry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several parties then searched for potential buyers and the work culminated into a Finnish ship operator sending a three-man team to inspect ''Finnjet'' during the August of that year. The team discovered only loose items such as mattresses, fridges, television sets and furniture had been removed from the ship, along with some consoles in accordance to Indian laws. However, the damp Indian climate had encrusted ''Finnjet'' completely with [[mold]] in just three months.&lt;ref name="FHStime"/&gt; She had become unsalvageable for the potential buyers and full breaking was initiated on 12 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;MTV3 News at 19:00 12 September 2008. Retrieved 28 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring of 2009, the breaker went on record for the Finnish newspaper [[Helsingin Sanomat]] of the breaking being more expensive than the scrapping value.&lt;ref name="HSFinnjetExpensive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Finnjetist%C3%A4+romuttamolle+taloudellinen+riippakivi/1135246142712|title=Finnjetistä romuttamolle taloudellinen riippakivi|accessdate=28 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525122007/http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Finnjetist%C3%A4+romuttamolle+taloudellinen+riippakivi/1135246142712|archivedate=25 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finnjet's thick steel ([[Rautaruukki]] [[NVA-36]]) ice-strengthened hull with double bottom, excessively strong bulkheads and reinforced fire-proofed compartments&lt;ref name="FHSplans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finnjet.fi|title=FHS Archive A+B, WHT407 plans|accessdate=28 October 2009 |work=Finnjet Historical Society ry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  turned out to be a nightmare for the breaker.

==Legacy==

The [[license]] and [[trademark]] to the name ''Finnjet'' continue to reside with [[Finnlines]] [[Oyj]]/[[Public limited company|Plc]], with a shared non-commercial license issued to [[Finnjet Historical Society ry]]. The society holds the official documentation, operator's archive and complete sets of building plans to realized or planned-only ''Finnjet'' conversions. Several lead designers, ship builders, captains, chief engineers and crew have joined the society during 2009.&lt;ref name="FHSsocietynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finnjet.fi/modules/news/index.php?storytopic=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181439/http://finnjet.fi/modules/news/index.php?storytopic=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 July 2011|title=Finnjet Historical Society ry – Society News|accessdate=28 October 2009|work=Finnjet Historical Society ry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Guaranteed'''" is a song written and performed by [[Pearl Jam]] vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]] from the ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into the Wild]]'' [[Into the Wild (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] (2007). It is the final track on the album, and also features a hidden track of "Guaranteed" (Humming Vocal) after about two minutes of silence following the regular version of "Guaranteed".

== Lyrics ==
Like the other songs on the soundtrack, "Guaranteed" is based on the story of American wanderer [[Christopher McCandless]]. After graduating as a top student from [[Emory University]] in 1990, McCandless decided to give up all of his savings and travel across the United States. In April 1992, McCandess hitchhiked to [[Alaska]] to live in the [[wilderness]] with little food and equipment, hoping to live a period of solitude. Nearly five months later, he died of [[starvation]] near [[Denali National Park and Preserve]]. Director [[Sean Penn]] said that as soon as he heard the song he "just felt that for sure this is the musical voice of (actor) Emile (Hirsch's) character."&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;Cohen, Jonathan. [https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN2638530120071027?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 "Q&amp;A: Penn, Vedder go where the "Wild" things are"]. [[Reuters]]. October 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddie Vedder]] has said that the lyrics "Don't come closer or I'll have to go/Owning me like gravity are places that pull/If ever there was someone to keep me at home/It would be you" are for McCandless' sister, Carine.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

The '''InterHarmony International Music Festival''' is a summer [[Music Festival]] in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. The Festival is an annual intensive summer performance festival, which includes a concert series of international solo musicians and young performers, and an institute for students of solo, [[chamber music]], and [[orchestral]] playing. The festival hosts three sessions in two locations: [[Acqui Terme]], in the Province of [[Alessandria]] in [[Piedmont]], [[Italy]], and [[Sulzbach-Rosenberg]], [[Germany]] in [[Bavaria]].

==History==
The InterHarmony International Music Festival was conceived in 1997, when cellist [[Misha Quint]], the Music Director and Founder, started his first International Music Festival in Blonay, Switzerland. This festival, the Intensive Cello Studies Abroad, was held at the Hindemith Foundation in Chalet de lacroix. Quint then opened the Soesterberg International Music Festival in Soesterberg, [[Netherlands]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="Soesterberg International Music Festival"&gt;{{cite web | title = Soesterberg International Music Festival | url = http://www.klossclassics.com/soesterberg.php | accessdate = 2010-12-28 | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713161123/http://www.klossclassics.com/soesterberg.php# | archive-date = 2011-07-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His festival in the [[Netherlands]] was a success and lasted for nine years. In the midst of the location in Soesterberg in 2000, the name, "InterHarmony", was born. 
[[File:InterHarmonyInternationalMusicFestivalGermany2012.jpg|thumb|InterHarmony International Music Festival in Sulzbach-Rosenberg, Germany 2012]]
The Festival in 2000 in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] was the first to bear this name. Other locations later took it up. Some locations, such as Soesterberg and Sulzbach-Rosenberg also retained the location name within the city as a subsidiary of InterHarmony. The Sulzbach-Rosenberg location of InterHarmony opened in 2005 and was an immediate success with local audiences. The Hinterzarten, [[Germany]] locale in the [[Black Forest]] lasted from 2008 – 2011. There were two locations in the [[United States]]: [[The Berkshires]], [[Massachusetts]] from 2007- 2008, and [[San Francisco]], [[California]], at [[San Francisco State University]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="The Berkshires Event Listing"&gt;{{cite web  | title = The Berkshires Event Listing  | url = http://www.cbs3springfield.com/community/events/18745334.html  | accessdate = 2010-12-28  | dead-url = yes  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080725071622/http://www.cbs3springfield.com/community/events/18745334.html#  | archive-date = 2008-07-25  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="San Francisco Event Listing"&gt;{{cite web  | title = San Francisco Event Listing  | url = http://creativearts.sfsu.edu/events/2201/creativity-arts-and-your-gray-matter  | accessdate = 2010-12-28  | dead-url = yes  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100824004054/http://www.creativearts.sfsu.edu/events/2201/creativity-arts-and-your-gray-matter#  | archive-date = 2010-08-24  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

InterHarmony remains one of the only festivals of its kind to move around the world. Many students and artists-in-residence end up traveling to all the locations, and in the case of 2012, spending nearly six  weeks at the festivals.&lt;ref name="InterHarmony 2012 Dates"&gt;{{cite web | title = InterHarmony 2012 Dates|dead-url=yes| url = https://www.trombone.net/events/event.cfm?ID=3831 | accessdate = 2013-01-05 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival has gained renown in [[Germany]] and brings international culture and artistry to its locations. For example, The U.S. Consul General spoke at the final concert where Misha Quint performed in 2008, and a Young Artist Showcase was given in the offices of the German Consulate in New York City in 2012.&lt;ref name="U.S. Consul General in Bavaria"&gt;{{cite web

The '''International Committee of the Red Cross''' ('''ICRC''') is a [[aid agency|humanitarian institution]] based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], and a three-time Nobel Prize Laureate. State parties (signatories) to the four [[Geneva Conventions]] of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 1977 ([[Protocol I]], [[Protocol II]]) and [[Protocol III|2005]] have given the ICRC a mandate to protect victims of international and internal [[war|armed conflicts]]. Such victims include war wounded, [[prisoner]]s, [[refugee]]s, [[civilian]]s, and other [[non-combatant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/p0790 |title=Discover the ICRC |accessdate=2009-05-12 |year=2007}} p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRC is part of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] along with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) and 190 [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|National Societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/who/movement.asp?navid=03_08|title=PageNotFound - IFRC|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest and most honoured organization within the movement and one of the most widely recognized organizations in the world, having won three [[Nobel Peace Prize]]s in 1917, 1944, and 1963.&lt;ref name="NobelFactsorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/organizations.html|title=Nobel Laureates Facts – Organizations|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solferino, Henry Dunant and the foundation of the ICRC===
[[File:Jean Henri Dunant.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Henry Dunant]], author of ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]'']]

Up until the middle of the 19th century, there were no organized and well-established army [[nursing]] systems for casualties and no safe and protected institutions to accommodate and treat those who were wounded on the battlefield. In June 1859, the Swiss businessman [[Henry Dunant]] travelled to Italy to meet French emperor [[Napoléon III]] with the intention of discussing difficulties in conducting business in Algeria, at that time occupied by France. When he arrived in the small [[Italy|Italian]] town of [[Solferino]] on the evening of 24 June, he witnessed the [[Battle of Solferino]], an engagement in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. In a single day, about 40,000 soldiers on both sides died or were left wounded on the field. Henry Dunant was shocked by the terrible aftermath of the battle, the suffering of the wounded soldiers, and the near-total lack of medical attendance and basic care. He completely abandoned the original intent of his trip and for several days he devoted himself to helping with the treatment and care for the wounded. He succeeded in organizing an overwhelming level of relief assistance by motivating the local population to aid without discrimination. Back in his home in [[Geneva]], he decided to write a book entitled ''[[A Memory of Solferino]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/publication/p0361.htm IRC, Memory of Solferino] by Henry Dunant, ICRC publication 1986, complete text&lt;/ref&gt; which he published with his own money in 1862. He sent copies of the book to leading political and military figures throughout Europe. In addition to penning a vivid description of his experiences in Solferino in 1859, he explicitly advocated the formation of national voluntary relief organizations to help nurse wounded soldiers in the case of war. In addition, he called for the development of international treaties to guarantee the neutrality and protection of those wounded on the battlefield as well as medics and field hospitals.
[[File:Original Geneva Conventions.jpg|thumb|Original document of the [[first Geneva Convention]], 1864]]
On 9 February 1863 in Geneva, Henry Dunant founded the "Committee of the Five" (together with four other leading figures from well-known Geneva families) as an investigatory commission of the [[Geneva Society for Public Welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/115?OpenDocument IRC] Geneva Society for Public Welfare, 1863&lt;/ref&gt; Their aim was to examine the feasibility of Dunant's ideas and to organize an international conference about their possible implementation. The members of this committee, aside from Dunant himself, were [[Gustave Moynier]], lawyer and chairman of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare; physician [[Louis Appia]], who had significant experience working as a field surgeon; Appia's friend and colleague [[Théodore Maunoir]], from the [[Geneva Hygiene and Health Commission]]; and [[Guillaume Henri Dufour|Guillaume-Henri Dufour]], a [[Swiss Army]] general of great renown. Eight days later, the five men decided to rename the committee to the "International Committee for Relief to the Wounded". In October (26–29) 1863, the international conference organized by the committee was held in Geneva to develop possible measures to improve medical services on the battle field. The conference was attended by 36 individuals: eighteen official delegates from national governments, six delegates from other non-governmental organizations, seven non-official foreign delegates, and the five members of the International Committee. The states and kingdoms represented by official delegates were [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], [[Second French Empire]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], [[Kingdom of Italy]], [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], [[Austrian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Saxony]], [[United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway]], and [[Spanish Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Angela Bennett: The Geneva Convention. The Hidden Origins of the Red Cross. Sutton Publishing, Gloucestershire 2005, {{ISBN|0-7509-4147-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the proposals written in the final resolutions of the conference, adopted on 29 October 1863, were:

* The foundation of national relief societies for wounded soldiers;
* Neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers;
* The utilization of volunteer forces for relief assistance on the battlefield;
* The organization of additional conferences to enact these concepts in legally binding international treaties; and
* The introduction of a common distinctive protection symbol for medical personnel in the field, namely a white armlet bearing a red cross, honoring the history of neutrality of Switzerland and of its own Swiss organizers by reversing the Swiss flag's colors.

Only one year later, the Swiss government invited the governments of all European countries, as well as the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, to attend an official diplomatic conference. Sixteen countries sent a total of twenty-six delegates to Geneva. On 22 August 1864, the conference adopted the first [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]] "for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field". Representatives of 12 states and kingdoms signed the convention:&lt;ref name=convention&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&amp;xp_treatySelected=120 |title=Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field.

The convention contained ten articles, establishing for the first time legally binding rules guaranteeing neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers, field medical personnel, and specific humanitarian institutions in an armed conflict. Furthermore, the convention defined two specific requirements for recognition of a national relief society by the International Committee:

* The national society must be recognized by its own national government as a relief society according to the convention, and
* The national government of the respective country must be a state party to the Geneva Convention.

Directly following the establishment of the Geneva Convention, the first national societies were founded in Belgium, Denmark, France, [[Oldenburg]], Prussia, Spain, and Württemberg. Also in 1864, Louis Appia and [[Charles van de Velde]], a captain of the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch Army]], became the first independent and neutral delegates to work under the symbol of the Red Cross in an armed conflict. Three years later in 1867, the first [[International Conference of National Aid Societies for the Nursing of the War Wounded]] was convened.

Also in 1867, Henry Dunant was forced to declare bankruptcy due to business failures in Algeria, partly because he had neglected his business interests during his tireless activities for the International Committee. The controversy surrounding Dunant's business dealings and the resulting negative public opinion, combined with an ongoing conflict with Gustave Moynier, led to Dunant's expulsion from his position as a member and secretary. He was charged with fraudulent bankruptcy and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Thus, he was forced to leave Geneva and never returned to his home city. In the following years, national societies were founded in nearly every country in Europe. The project resonated well with patriotic sentiments that were on the rise in the late-nineteenth-century, and national societies were often encouraged as signifiers of national moral superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dromi|first1=Shai M.|title=For good and country: nationalism and the diffusion of humanitarianism in the late nineteenth century|journal=The Sociological Review|date=2016|volume=64|issue=2|pages=79–97|doi=10.1002/2059-7932.12003|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2059-7932.12003/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, the committee adopted the name "International Committee of the Red Cross" (ICRC), which is still its official designation today. Five years later, the [[American Red Cross]] was founded through the efforts of [[Clara Barton]]. More and more countries signed the Geneva Convention and began to respect it in practice during armed conflicts. In a rather short period of time, the Red Cross gained huge momentum as an internationally respected movement, and the national societies became increasingly popular as a venue for volunteer work.

When the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded in 1901, the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] opted to give it jointly to Henry Dunant and [[Frédéric Passy]], a leading international pacifist. More significant than the honour of the prize itself, the official congratulation from the International Committee of the Red Cross marked the overdue rehabilitation of Henry Dunant and represented a tribute to his key role in the formation of the Red Cross. Dunant died nine years later in the small Swiss health resort of [[Heiden, Switzerland|Heiden]]. Only two months earlier his long-standing adversary Gustave Moynier had also died, leaving a mark in the history of the Committee as its longest-serving President ever.

In 1906, the 1864 Geneva Convention was revised for the first time. One year later, the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention X]], adopted at the Second International Peace Conference in [[The Hague]], extended the scope of the Geneva Convention to naval warfare. Shortly before the beginning of the First World War in 1914, 50 years after the foundation of the ICRC and the adoption of the first Geneva Convention, there were already 45 national relief societies throughout the world. The movement had extended itself beyond Europe and North America to Central and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, El Salvador, Uruguay, Venezuela), Asia (the Republic of China, Japan, Korea, [[Siam]]), and Africa (South Africa).

===World War I===

[[File:Honneur à la Croix-Rouge-1915.JPG|upright|thumb|French postcard celebrating the role of Red Cross nurses during the First World War, 1915.]]

With the outbreak of World War I, the ICRC found itself confronted with enormous challenges which it could only handle by working closely with the national Red Cross societies. Red Cross nurses from around the world, including the United States and Japan, came to support the medical services of the armed forces of the European countries involved in the war. On 15 October 1914, immediately after the start of the war, the ICRC set up its International Prisoners-of-War ([[POW]]) Agency, which had about 1,200 mostly volunteer staff members by the end of 1914. By the end of the war, the Agency had transferred about 20&amp;nbsp;million letters and messages, 1.9&amp;nbsp;million parcels, and about 18&amp;nbsp;million [[Swiss francs]] in monetary donations to POWs of all affected countries. Furthermore, due to the intervention of the Agency, about 200,000 prisoners were exchanged between the warring parties, released from captivity and returned to their home country. The organizational card index of the Agency accumulated about 7 million records from 1914 to 1923, each card representing an individual prisoner or missing person. The card index led to the identification of about 2&amp;nbsp;million POWs and the ability to contact their families, as part of the [[Restoring Family Links]] effort of the organization. The complete index is on loan today from the ICRC to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum]] in Geneva. The right to access the index is still strictly restricted to the ICRC.

During the entire war, the ICRC monitored warring parties' compliance with the Geneva Conventions of the 1907 revision and forwarded complaints about violations to the respective country. When [[chemical weapons]] were used in this war for the first time in history, the ICRC vigorously protested against this new type of warfare. Even without having a mandate from the Geneva Conventions, the ICRC tried to ameliorate the suffering of civil populations. In territories that were officially designated as "occupied territories," the ICRC could assist the civilian population on the basis of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]]'s "Laws and Customs of War on Land" of 1907. This convention was also the legal basis for the ICRC's work for prisoners of war. In addition to the work of the International Prisoner-of-War Agency as described above this included inspection visits to [[POW camp]]s. A total of 524 camps throughout Europe were visited by 41 delegates from the ICRC until the end of the war.

Between 1916 and 1918, the ICRC published a number of [[postcard]]s with scenes from the POW camps. The pictures showed the prisoners in day-to-day activities such as the distribution of letters from home. The intention of the ICRC was to provide the families of the prisoners with some hope and solace and to alleviate their uncertainties about the fate of their loved ones. After the end of the war, the ICRC organized the return of about 420,000 prisoners to their home countries. In 1920, the task of repatriation was handed over to the newly founded [[League of Nations]], which appointed the Norwegian diplomat and scientist [[Fridtjof Nansen]] as its "High Commissioner for Repatriation of the War Prisoners". His legal mandate was later extended to support and care for war refugees and displaced persons when his office became that of the League of Nations "[[High Commissioner for Refugees]]". Nansen, who invented the ''[[Nansen passport]]'' for stateless refugees and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922, appointed two delegates from the ICRC as his deputies.

A year before the end of the war, the ICRC received the 1917 Nobel Peace Prize for its outstanding wartime work. It was the only Nobel Peace Prize awarded in the period from 1914 to 1918. In 1923, the Committee adopted a change in its policy regarding the selection of new members. Until then, only citizens from the city of Geneva could serve in the Committee. This limitation was expanded to include Swiss citizens. As a direct consequence of World War I, an additional protocol to the Geneva Convention was adopted in 1925 which outlawed the use of suffocating or poisonous gases and biological agents as weapons. Four years later, the original Convention was revised and the second Geneva Convention "relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War" was established. The events of World War I and the respective activities of the ICRC significantly increased the reputation and authority of the Committee among the international community and led to an extension of its competencies.

As early as in 1934, a draft proposal for an additional convention for the protection of the civil population during an armed conflict was adopted by the International Red Cross Conference. Unfortunately, most governments had little interest in implementing this convention, and it was thus prevented from entering into force before the beginning of World War II.

===Chaco War===
In the [[Interwar period]], Bolivia and Paraguay were disputing possession of the [[Gran Chaco]] - a desert region between the two countries. The dispute escalated into a [[Chaco War|full-scale conflict]] in 1932. During the war the ICRC visited 18,000 Bolivian prisoners of war and 2,500 Paraguayan detainees. With the help of the ICRC both countries made improvements to the conditions of the detainees.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/5gkebj.htm|title=The Chaco war (1932-1935)|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
{{further|Theresienstadt concentration camp and the Red Cross}}
[[File:HZwLazarecie1940.jpg|thumb|Red Cross message from [[Łódź]], Poland, 1940.]]

The most reliable primary source on the role of the Red Cross during World War II are the three volumes of the "Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross on its activities during the second world war (September 1, 1939 – June 30, 1947)" written by the International Committee of the Red Cross itself. The report can be read online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/ReportOfTheInternationalCommitteeOfTheRedCrossOnItsActivitiesDuringTheSecondWorl |title=The Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross on its activities during the second world war (September 1, 1939 – June 30, 1947) Geneva 1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal basis of the work of the ICRC during World War II was the Geneva Conventions in their 1929 revision. The activities of the Committee were similar to those during World War I: visiting and monitoring POW camps, organizing relief assistance for civilian populations, and administering the exchange of messages regarding prisoners and missing persons. By the end of the war, 179 delegates had conducted 12,750 visits to POW camps in 41 countries. The Central Information Agency on Prisoners-of-War (''Zentralauskunftsstelle für Kriegsgefangene'') had a staff of 3,000, the card index tracking prisoners contained 45&amp;nbsp;million cards, and 120&amp;nbsp;million messages were exchanged by the Agency. One major obstacle was that the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-controlled [[German Red Cross]] refused to cooperate with the Geneva statutes including blatant violations such as the deportation of Jews from Germany and the [[Holocaust|mass murders]] conducted in the [[concentration camps]] run by the German government. Moreover, two other main parties to the conflict, the Soviet Union and Japan, were not party to the 1929 Geneva Conventions and were not legally required to follow the rules of the conventions.

During the war, the ICRC failed to obtain an agreement with Nazi Germany about the treatment of detainees in concentration camps, and it eventually abandoned applying pressure to avoid disrupting its work with POWs. The ICRC also failed to develop a response to reliable information about the extermination camps and the mass killing of European Jews. This is still considered the greatest failure of the ICRC in its history. After November 1943, the ICRC achieved permission to send parcels to concentration camp detainees with known names and locations. Because the notices of receipt for these parcels were often signed by other inmates, the ICRC managed to register the identities of about 105,000 detainees in the concentration camps and delivered about 1.1&amp;nbsp;million parcels, primarily to the camps [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Buchenwald]], [[Ravensbrück]], and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Favez |first=Jean-Claude |title=The Red Cross and the Holocaust |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-521-41587-3 }}p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marcel Junod-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marcel Junod]], delegate of the ICRC, visiting POWs in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;br&gt;{{small|(Benoit Junod, Switzerland)}}]]

Swiss historian Jean-Claude Favez, who conducted an 8-year review of the Red Cross records, says that even though the Red Cross knew by November 1942 about the Nazi's annihilation plans for the Jews – and even discussed it with U.S. officials – the group did nothing to inform the public, maintaining silence even in the face of pleas by Jewish groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Favez |first=Jean-Claude |title=The Red Cross and the Holocaust |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-521-41587-3 }}p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Red Cross was based in Geneva and largely funded by the Swiss government, it was very sensitive to Swiss wartime attitudes and policies. On October 1942, the Swiss government and the Red Cross' board of members vetoed a proposal by several Red Cross board members to condemn the persecution of civilians by the Nazis. For the rest of the war, the Red Cross took its cues from Switzerland in avoiding acts of opposition or confrontation with the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Favez |first=Jean-Claude |title=The Red Cross and the Holocaust |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-521-41587-3 }}p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A sick Polish survivor in the Hannover-Ahlem concentration camp receives medicine from a German Red Cross worker.jpg|thumb|A sick Polish survivor in the Hannover-Ahlem concentration camp receives medicine from a German Red Cross worker, April 1945]]
On 12 March 1945, ICRC President Jacob Burckhardt received a message from SS General [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] accepting the ICRC's demand to allow delegates to visit the concentration camps. This agreement was bound by the condition that these delegates would have to stay in the camps until the end of the war. Ten delegates, among them [[Louis Haefliger]] ([[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen Camp]]), [[Paul Dunant]] ([[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt Camp]]) and [[Victor Maurer]] ([[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau Camp]]), accepted the assignment and visited the camps. Louis Haefliger prevented the forceful eviction or blasting of Mauthausen-Gusen by alerting American troops, thereby saving the lives of about 60,000 inmates. His actions were condemned by the ICRC because they were deemed as acting unduly on his own authority and risking the ICRC's neutrality. Only in 1990 was his reputation finally rehabilitated by ICRC President [[Cornelio Sommaruga]].

In 1944, the ICRC received its second Nobel Peace Prize. As in World War I, it received the only Peace Prize awarded during the main period of war, 1939 to 1945. At the end of the war, the ICRC worked with national Red Cross societies to organize relief assistance to those countries most severely affected. In 1948, the Committee published a report reviewing its war-era activities from 1 September 1939 to 30 June 1947. Since January 1996, the ICRC archive for this period has been open to academic and public research.

===After World War II===

[[File:IKRK Hauptquartier.jpg|thumb|The ICRC Headquarters in Geneva.]]

On 12 August 1949, further revisions to the existing two Geneva Conventions were adopted. An additional convention "for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea", now called the second Geneva Convention, was brought under the Geneva Convention umbrella as a successor to the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|1907 Hague Convention X]]. The 1929 Geneva convention "relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War" may have been the second Geneva Convention from a historical point of view (because it was actually formulated in Geneva), but after 1949 it came to be called the third Convention because it came later chronologically than the Hague Convention. Reacting to the experience of World War II, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], a new Convention "relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War," was established. Also, the additional protocols of 8 June 1977 were intended to make the conventions apply to internal conflicts such as civil wars. Today, the four conventions and their added protocols contain more than 600 articles, a remarkable expansion when compared to the mere 10 articles in the first 1864 convention.

In celebration of its centennial in 1963, the ICRC, together with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|League of Red Cross Societies]], received its third Nobel Peace Prize. Since 1993, non-Swiss individuals have been allowed to serve as Committee delegates abroad, a task which was previously restricted to Swiss citizens. Indeed, since then, the share of staff without Swiss citizenship has increased to about 35%.

On 16 October 1990, the [[UN General Assembly]] decided to grant the ICRC [[observer status]] for its assembly sessions and sub-committee meetings, the first observer status given to a private organization. The resolution was jointly proposed by 138 member states and introduced by the Italian ambassador, [[Vieri Traxler]], in memory of the organization's origins in the Battle of Solferino. An agreement with the Swiss government signed on 19 March 1993, affirmed the already long-standing policy of full independence of the Committee from any possible interference by Switzerland. The agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland.

The ICRC continued its activities throughout the 1990s. It broke its customary media silence when it denounced the [[Rwandan Genocide]] in 1994. It struggled to prevent the crimes that happened in and around [[Srebrenica]] in 1995 but admitted, "We must acknowledge that despite our efforts to help thousands of civilians forcibly expelled from the town and despite the dedication of our colleagues on the spot, the ICRC's impact on the unfolding of the tragedy was extremely limited."&lt;ref&gt;Mégevand-Roggo, Béatrice.

====Fatalities====

At the end of the [[Cold War]], the ICRC's work actually became more dangerous. In the 1990s, more delegates lost their lives than at any point in its history, especially when working in local and internal armed conflicts. These incidents often demonstrated a lack of respect for the rules of the Geneva Conventions and their protection symbols. Among the slain delegates were:

* Frédéric Maurice. He died on 19 May 1992 at the age of 39, one day after a Red Cross transport he was escorting was attacked in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]n city of [[Sarajevo]].
* Fernanda Calado (Spain), Ingeborg Foss (Norway), Nancy Malloy (Canada), Gunnhild Myklebust (Norway), Sheryl Thayer (New Zealand), and Hans Elkerbout (Netherlands). They were shot at point-blank range while sleeping in the early hours of 17 December 1996 in the ICRC field hospital in the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] city of [[Nowije Atagi]] near [[Grozny]]. Their murderers have never been caught and there was no apparent motive for the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jnj3.htm |title=17 December 1996 : Six ICRC delegates assassinated in Chechnya |author=François Budnion |date=30 April 1997 |website=www.icrc.org |publisher=ICRC |access-date=4 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rita Fox (Switzerland), Véronique Saro ([[Democratic Republic of Congo]], formerly Zaire), Julio Delgado (Colombia), Unen Ufoirworth (DR Congo), Aduwe Boboli (DR Congo), and Jean Molokabonge (DR Congo). On 26 April 2001, they were en route with two cars on a relief mission in the northeast of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] when they came under fatal fire from unknown attackers.
* [[Ricardo Munguía (aid worker)|Ricardo Munguia]] (El Salvador). He was working as a water engineer in Afghanistan and travelling  from [[Kandahar]] to [[Tirin Kot]] with local colleagues on 27 March 2003 when their car was stopped by unknown armed men. He was killed execution-style at point-blank range while his colleagues were allowed to escape. He was 39 years old. The killing prompted the ICRC to temporarily suspend operations across Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/news/2003/03/28/swiss-icrc-delegate-murdered |title=Swiss ICRC delegate murdered |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=28 March 2003 |website=www.irinnews.org |publisher=IRIN |access-date=8 March 2016 |quote=Ricardo Munguia, a Swiss citizen of Salvadorian origin was travelling with Afghan colleagues on an assignment to improve the water supply to the district.

* Vatche Arslanian (Canada). Since 2001, he worked as a logistics coordinator for the ICRC mission in Iraq. He died when he was travelling through Baghdad together with members of the Iraqi Red Crescent. Their car accidentally came into the crossfire of fighting in the city.
* Nadisha Yasassri Ranmuthu (Sri Lanka). He was killed by unknown attackers on 22 July 2003, when his car was fired upon near the city of [[Hilla]] in the south of [[Baghdad]].
*Emmerich Pregetter (Austria). He was an ICRC Logistics Specialist who was killed by a swarm of bees on 11 August 2008. Emmerich was participating in a field trip along with the ICRC Water and Habitat team on a convoy which was delivering construction material for reconstruction of a rural surgical health clinic in the area of Jebel Marra, West Darfur, Sudan.

===The Holocaust===

By taking part in the 1995 ceremony to commemorate the liberation of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], the President of the ICRC, [[Cornelio Sommaruga]], sought to show that the organization was fully aware of the gravity of [[The Holocaust]] and the need to keep the memory of it alive, so as to prevent any repetition of it. He paid tribute to all those who had suffered or lost their lives during the war and publicly regretted the past mistakes and shortcomings of the Red Cross with regard to the victims of the concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/history-holocauste-020205.htm |title=ICRC in WW II: the Holocaust |accessdate=2012-08-28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, an ICRC official outlined some of the lessons the organization has learned from the failure:

*from a legal point of view, the work that led to the adoption of the Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war;
*from an ethical point of view, the adoption of the declaration of the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, building on the distinguished work of [[Max Huber (statesman)|Max Huber]] and [[Jean Pictet]], to prevent any more abuses such as those that occurred within the movement after [[Hitler]] rose to power in 1933;
*on a political level, the ICRC's relationship with Switzerland was redesigned to ensure its independence;
*with a view to keeping memories alive, the ICRC accepted, in 1955, to take over the direction of the [[International Tracing Service]] where records from concentration camps are maintained;
*finally, to establish the historical facts of the case, the ICRC invited Jean-Claude Favez to carry out an independent investigation of its activities on behalf of the victims of Nazi persecution, and gave him unfettered access to its archives relating to this period; out of concern for transparency, the ICRC also decided to give all other historians access to its archives dating back more than 50 years; having gone over the conclusions of Favez's work, the ICRC acknowledged its past failings and expressed its regrets in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/6ayg86 |title=Dialogue with the past: the ICRC and the Nazi death camps |accessdate=2007-10-19 |last=Buignion |first=François |date=2002-11-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official statement made on 27 January 2005, the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the ICRC stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Auschwitz also represents the greatest failure in the history of the ICRC, aggravated by its lack of decisiveness in taking steps to aid the victims of Nazi persecution. This failure will remain part of the ICRC's memory, as will the courageous acts of individual ICRC delegates at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/68zeb2?opendocument |title=Commemorating the liberation of Auschwitz |accessdate=2007-10-19 |last=ICRC: Official Statement |date=2005-01-27 |archivedate=10 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CnOjqeec?url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/68zeb2.htm |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Flag of the ICRC.svg|thumb|The emblem of the International Committee of the Red Cross (French: ''Comité international de la croix-rouge'').]]

The original motto of the International Committee of the Red Cross was ''Inter Arma Caritas'' ("Amidst War, Charity"). It has preserved this motto while other Red Cross organizations have adopted others. Due to Geneva's location in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, the ICRC is also known under its initial French name ''Comité international de la Croix-Rouge'' (CICR). However, the ICRC has three official languages (English, French and Spanish). The official symbol of the ICRC is the Red Cross on white background (the inverse of the [[Flag of Switzerland|Swiss flag]]) with the words "COMITE INTERNATIONAL GENEVE" circling the cross.

Under the Geneva Convention, the red cross, red crescent and red crystal emblems provide protection for military medical services and relief workers in armed conflicts and is to be placed on humanitarian and medical vehicles and buildings. The original emblem that has a red cross on a white background is the exact reverse of the flag of neutral Switzerland. It was later supplemented by two others which are the [[Red Crescent]], and the [[Red Crystal]]. The Red Crescent was adopted by the Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish war and the Red Crystal by the governments in 2005, as an additional emblem devoid of any national, political or religious connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/emblem/index.jsp|title=Emblem|work=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission===
The official mission statement says that: "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral, and independent organization whose independently humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of war and internal violence and to provide them with assistance." It also conducts and coordinates international [[humanitarian aid|relief]] and works to promote and strengthen [[international humanitarian law]] and universal humanitarian principles.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC. ''[http://www.icrc.org/HOME.NSF/060a34982cae624ec12566fe00326312/125ffe2d4c7f68acc1256ae300394f6e?OpenDocument The Mission.]''. 7 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The core tasks of the Committee, which are derived from the Geneva Conventions and its own statutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList130/E1B071F72AF9BAB4C1256B66005C48D6|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|date=3 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* to monitor compliance of warring parties with the Geneva Conventions
* to organize nursing and care for those who are wounded on the battlefield
* to supervise the treatment of prisoners of war and make confidential interventions with detaining authorities
* to help with the search for missing persons in an armed conflict ([[Restoring Family Links|tracing service]])
* to organize protection and care for civil populations
* to act as a neutral intermediary between warring parties

The ICRC drew up seven fundamental principles in 1965 that were adopted by the entire Red Cross Movement.&lt;ref&gt;David P Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians: The International Committee of the Red Cross'', (Cambridge, NY:Cambridge University Press, 2005), 161.&lt;/ref&gt; They are humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, volunteerism, unity, and universality.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC. 1 Jan 1995. [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/57jmft?opendocument The Fundamental Principles].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status===
The ICRC is the only institution explicitly named in [[international humanitarian law]] as a controlling authority. The legal mandate of the ICRC stems from the four [[Geneva Conventions]] of 1949, as well as its own Statutes. The ICRC also undertakes tasks that are not specifically mandated by law, such as visiting political prisoners outside of conflict and providing relief in [[natural disaster]]s.

The ICRC is a private association registered in Switzerland that has enjoyed various degrees of special privileges and legal [[Charitable immunity|immunities]] within the territory of Switzerland for many years.{{When|date=November 2010}} On 19 March 1993, a legal foundation for this special treatment was created by a formal agreement between the Swiss government and the ICRC. This agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign [[diplomatic mission|embassies]], and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland. On the other hand, Switzerland does not recognize ICRC-issued passports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udiregelverk.no/~/media/Images/Rettskilder/Visa%20Code/Visa%20Code%20vedlegg%2010%20a.ashx Council of the European Union – Schengen Visa Working Party – Table of travel documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114115244/http://www.udiregelverk.no/~/media/Images/Rettskilder/Visa%20Code/Visa%20Code%20vedlegg%2010%20a.ashx |date=14 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, the ICRC is not a sovereign entity like the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] and also it is not an [[international organization]], neither of [[International nongovernmental organization|non-governmental]] nor of [[Intergovernmental organization|governmental]] type. The ICRC limits its membership to Swiss nationals only, and also {{Citation needed span|text=unlike most NGOs|date=November 2010}} it does not have a policy of open and unrestricted membership for individuals as its new members are selected by the Committee itself (a process called cooptation). However, since the early 1990s, the ICRC employs persons from all over the world to serve in its field mission and at Headquarters. In 2007, almost half of ICRC staff was non-Swiss. The ICRC has special privileges and legal immunities in many countries,{{Which|date=November 2010}} based on national law in these countries, based on agreements between the ICRC and the respective governments, or, in some cases, based on international jurisprudence (such as the right of ICRC delegates not to bear witness in front of international tribunals).

===Legal Basis===
The ICRC's operations are generally based on [[international humanitarian law]], primarily comprising the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, their two Additional Protocols of 1977 and Additional Protocol III of 2005, the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and the resolutions of the International Conferences of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/annual-report/annual-report-legal-bases-2009.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

International humanitarian law is founded upon the Geneva conventions, the first of which was signed in 1864 by 16 countries. The First Geneva Convention of 1949 covers the protection for the wounded and sick of armed conflict on land. The Second Geneva Convention asks for the protection and care for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked of armed conflict at sea. The Third Geneva Convention concerns the treatment of prisoners of war. The Fourth Geneva Convention concerns the protection of civilians in time of war. In addition, there are many more customary international laws that come into effect when necessary.

===Funding and financial matters===
The 2010 budget of the ICRC amounts to about 1156&amp;nbsp;million [[Swiss franc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC. 1 Dec 2009 [http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/appeals-keydata-011209 Key Data for ICRC Emergency and Headquarters Appeals 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; All payments to the ICRC are voluntary and are received as donations based on two types of appeals issued by the Committee: an annual ''Headquarters Appeal'' to cover its internal costs and ''Emergency Appeals'' for its individual missions. The total budget for 2009 consists of about 996.9&amp;nbsp;million Swiss Francs (85% of the total) for field work and 168.6&amp;nbsp;million Swiss Francs (15%) for internal costs. In 2009, the budget for field work increased by 6.9% and the internal budget by 4.4% compared to 2008, primarily due to above-average increases in the number and scope of its missions in Africa.

Most of the ICRC's funding comes from Switzerland and the United States, with other European states and the EU close behind. Together with Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, they contribute about 80–85% of the ICRC's budget. About 3% comes from private gifts, and the rest comes from national Red Cross societies.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians'', 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsibilities within the movement===
The ICRC is responsible for legally recognizing a relief society as an official national [[List of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|Red Cross or Red Crescent society]] and thus accepting it into the movement. The exact rules for recognition are defined in the statutes of the movement. After recognition by the ICRC, a national society is admitted as a member to the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (the Federation, or IFRC). The ICRC and the Federation cooperate with the individual national societies in their international missions, especially with human, material, and financial resources and organizing on-site logistics. According to the 1997 [[Seville Agreement]], the ICRC is the lead Red Cross agency in conflicts while other organizations within the movement take the lead in non-war situations. National societies will be given the lead especially when a conflict is happening within their own country.

==Organization==
The ICRC is headquartered in the Swiss city of [[Geneva]] and has external offices called Delegations in about eighty countries. Each delegation is under the responsibility of a Head of delegation who is the official representative of the ICRC in the country. Of its 2,000 professional employees, roughly 800 work in its Geneva headquarters and 1,200 expatriates work in the field. About half of the field workers serve as delegates managing ICRC operations, while the other half are specialists such as doctors, [[agronomist]]s, engineers, or [[interpreters]]. In the delegations, the international staff are assisted by some 13,000 national employees, bringing the total staff under the authority of the ICRC to roughly 15,000. Delegations also often work closely with the National Red Cross Societies of the countries where they are based, and thus can call on the volunteers of the National Red Cross to assist in some of the ICRC's operations.

The organizational structure of the ICRC is not well understood by outsiders. This is partly because of organizational secrecy, but also because the structure itself has been prone to frequent change. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}The Assembly and Presidency are two long-standing institutions, but the Assembly Council and Directorate were created only in the latter part of the twentieth century. Decisions are often made in a collective way, so authority and power relationships are not set in stone. Today, the leading organs are the Directorate and the Assembly.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Directorate===
The Directorate is the executive body of the ICRC. It attends to the daily management of the ICRC, whereas the Assembly sets policy. The Directorate consists of a Director-General and five directors in the areas of "Operations", "Human Resources", "Financial Resources and Logistics ", "Communication and Information Management", and "International Law and Cooperation within the Movement". The members of the Directorate are appointed by the Assembly to serve for four years. The Director-General has assumed more personal responsibility in recent years, much like a CEO, where he was formerly more of a first among equals at the Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians'', 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly===
The Assembly (also called the Committee) convenes on a regular basis and is responsible for defining aims, guidelines, and strategies and for supervising the financial matters of the Committee. The Assembly has a membership of a maximum of twenty-five Swiss citizens. Members must speak the house language of French, but many also speak English and German as well. These Assembly members are [[co-option|co-opted]] for a period of four years, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual member can serve. A three-quarters majority vote from all members is required for re-election after the third term, which acts as a motivation for members to remain active and productive.

In the early years, every Committee member was Genevan, Protestant, [[White (people)|white]], and male. The first woman, Renée-Marguerite Cramer, was co-opted in 1918. Since then, several women have attained the Vice Presidency, and the female proportion after the [[Cold War]] has been about 15%. The first non-Genevans were admitted in 1923, and one Jew has served in the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians'', 203-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the rest of the Red Cross Movement may be multi-national, the Committee believes that its mono-national nature is an asset because the nationality in question is Swiss. Thanks to permanent Swiss [[Neutral country|neutrality]], conflicting parties can be sure that no one from "the enemy" will be setting policy in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians'', 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71 showed that even Red Cross actors (in this case National Societies) can be so bound by nationalism that they are unable to sustain neutral humanitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Bugnion, ''La Protection'', 1138–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jakob Kellenberger.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jakob Kellenberger]], former President of the ICRC (2000–2012)]]

====Assembly Council====
Furthermore, the Assembly elects a five-member Assembly Council that constitutes an especially active core of the Assembly. The Council meets at least ten times per year and has the authority to decide on behalf of the full Assembly in some matters. The Council is also responsible for organizing the Assembly meetings and for facilitating communication between the Assembly and the Directorate. The Assembly Council normally includes the President, two Vice Presidents and two elected members. While one of the Vice Presidents is elected for a four-year term, the other is appointed permanently, his tenure ending by retirement from the vice presidency or from the Committee. Currently{{when|date=January 2013}} [[Olivier Vodoz]] and [[Christine Beerli]]&lt;ref&gt;ICRC. 27 April 2007. ''[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/vice-president-news-270407]''.&lt;/ref&gt; are the Vice Presidents.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC. 1 Jan 2006. ''[http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/icrc-members-biography-250108 The members of the International Committee of the Red Cross]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The President====
The Assembly also selects, for a term of four years, one individual to act as President of the ICRC. The President is both a member of the Assembly and the leader of the ICRC, and has always been included on the Council since its formation. The President automatically becomes a member of both the Council and the Assembly, but does not necessarily come from within the ICRC. There is a strong faction within the Assembly that wants to reach outside the organization to select a President from Swiss government or professional circles (such as banking or medicine).&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians'', 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the four most recent Presidents were all previously officials for the Swiss government. The President's influence and role are not well-defined, and change depending upon the times and each President's personal style.

From 2000 to 2012, the President of the ICRC was [[Jakob Kellenberger]], a reclusive man who rarely made diplomatic appearances, but was quite  skilled in personal negotiation and comfortable with the dynamics of the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians'', 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2012, the President has been Peter Maurer, a Swiss citizen who is a former Secretary for Foreign Affairs. He was appointed by the Assembly for a renewable four-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2011/geneva-news-2011-10-19.htm ICRC names new president]. 19 October 2011.

{{div col end}}

===Staff===
As the ICRC has grown and become more directly involved in conflicts, it has seen an increase in professional staff rather than volunteers over the years. The ICRC had only twelve employees in 1914&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Ryfman, ''La question humanitaire'' (Paris:Ellipses, 1999), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,900 in the Second World War complemented its 1,800 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Ryfman, ''La question humanitaire'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of paid staff dropped off after both wars, but has increased once again in the last few decades, averaging 500 field staff in the 1980s and over a thousand in the 1990s. Beginning in the 1970s, the ICRC became more systematic in training to develop a more professional staff.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Willemin and Roger Heacock, ''The International Committee of the Red Cross'', (Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRC offers attractive careers for university graduates, especially in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;"Le CICR manqué de bras," ''LM'', 20 July 2002, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; but the workload as an ICRC employee is demanding. 15% of the staff leaves each year and 75% of employees stay less than three years.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians'', 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRC staff is multi-national and averaged about 50% non-Swiss citizens in 2004. The ICRC's international staff are assisted in their work by some 13,000 national employees hired in the countries where the delegations are based.

===The ICRC worldwide 2013===
The ICRC operates in over 80 countries with a total number of 11,000 employed people worldwide. The extensive network of missions and delegations of the ICRC can relieve nations that are affected by armed conflicts and other sources of violence. In 2013 the ten largest operations worldwide are Pakistan, Mali/Niger, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, Colombia, Israel, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/where-we-work/index.jsp ICRC worldwide]. 8 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, with support from the Red Cross Society of the DRC, the ICRC returned to their families in the RDC 838 unaccompanied children including over 390 former child soldiers, 34 of whom had been in neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2012/congo-kinshasa-south-sudan-news-2012-02-06.htm|title=Democratic Republic of the Congo/South Sudan: 61 children reunited with their families|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships within the movement==
[[File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|thumb|]]

By virtue of its age and its special position under [[international humanitarian law]], the ICRC is the lead agency in the [[Red Cross Movement]], but it has weathered some power struggles within the movement. The ICRC has come into conflict with the Federation and certain national societies at various times. The American Red Cross threatened to supplant the ICRC with its creation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as "a real international Red Cross" after the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Durand, ''History of the International Committee of the Red Cross: From Sarajevo to Hiroshima'', (Geneva:ICRC, 1984), 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of the [[Swedish Red Cross]] desired to supplant the Swiss authority of the ICRC after WWII.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the Swedish sentiments subsided, and the IFRC grew to work more harmoniously with the ICRC after years of organizational discord.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the IFRC's Movement Cooperation division organizes interaction and cooperation with the ICRC.

In 1997, the ICRC and the IFRC signed the [[Seville Agreement]] which further defined the responsibilities of both organizations within the movement. According to the agreement, the Federation is the lead agency of the movement in any emergency situation which does not take place as part of an armed conflict.

===Acceptance of Magen David Adom===

From its inception in 1930 until 2006, the [[Magen David Adom]] organization, the Israeli equivalent to the Red Cross, was not accepted as part of the Federation, as it used the [[Star of David]], which the ICRC refused to recognize as an acceptable symbol. This meant that although Arab ambulances would be protected by the ICRC, Israeli ambulances would not.  In May 2000, [[Bernadine Healy]], the President of the [[American Red Cross]], wrote: "The international committee's feared proliferation of symbols is a pitiful [[fig leaf]], used for decades as the reason for excluding the Magen David Adom – the Shield (or Star) of David."  In protest over the ICRC's perceived anti-Israel discrimination, the ARC withdrew its financial support. In 2005, at a meeting of nations party to the Geneva convention, the ICRC adopted the new [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Crystal|Red Crystal]].  Magen David Adom then centered the Star of David sign inside the newly accepted signage, and in 2006 was accepted as a full member. Yonatan Yagodovsky, director of MDA's fundraising department, said in an article published in October 2011 that "MDA will continue to use its emblem and logo, and no one ever asked us to take it off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4893&amp;Itemid=53|title=MDA symbol on ambulances in Yesha still unresolved|publisher=|access-date=6 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108132102/http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4893&amp;Itemid=53|archive-date=8 November 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International relationships ==

The ICRC prefers to engage [[Sovereign state|states]] directly and relies on low-key and confidential negotiations&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last=Merson |editor1-first=M. H. |editor2-last=Black |editor2-first=R. E. |editor3-last=Mills |editor3-first=A. J. |title=International Public Health: Diseases, Programs, Systems, and Policies |edition=2nd |location=Boston |publisher=Jones and Barlett |year=2006 |page=497 |isbn=0-7637-2967-1 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; to lobby for access to [[prisoners of war]] and improvement in their treatment. Its findings are not available to the general public but are shared only with the relevant government. This is in contrast to related organizations like [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]] and [[Amnesty International]] who are more willing to expose abuses and apply public pressure to governments. The ICRC reasons that this approach allows it greater access and cooperation from governments in the long run.

When granted only partial access, the ICRC takes what it can get and keeps discreetly lobbying for greater access. In the era of [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid South Africa]], it was granted access to prisoners like [[Nelson Mandela]] serving sentences, but not to those under [[interrogation]] and awaiting trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David P. |last=Forsythe |title=Choices More Ethical Than Legal: The International Committee of the Red Cross and Human Rights |journal=Ethics and International Affairs |volume=7 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=139–140 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-7093.1993.tb00147.x }}.&lt;/ref&gt; After his release, Mandela publicly praised the Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Nelson |last=Mandela |title=Speech before the British Red Cross, London |date=10 July 2003 |url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList265/C6B8A8882CDE0122C1256D67004BCA54 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some governments use the ICRC as a tool to promote their own ends.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The presence of respectable [[Aid agency|aid organizations]] can make weak [[Form of government|regimes]] appear more [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimate]]. Fiona Terry contends that "this is particularly true of [the] ICRC, whose mandate, reputation, and discretion imbue its presence with a particularly affirming quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Fiona |last=Terry |title=Condemned to Repeat? The Paradox of Humanitarian Action |location=London |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2002 |page=45 |isbn=0-8014-3960-4 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing this power, the ICRC can pressure weak governments to change their behavior by threatening to withdraw. As mentioned above, Nelson Mandela acknowledged that the ICRC compelled better treatment of prisoners&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Nelson |last=Mandela |title=Interview on Larry King Live |date=16 May 2000 |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0005/16/lkl.00.html |publisher=CNN}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and had leverage over his South African captors because "avoiding international condemnation was the authorities' main goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Nelson |last=Mandela |title=Long Walk to Freedom |location=London |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1994 |page=396 |isbn=0-316-54585-6 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a controversial move, three officials from the Palestinian political movement [[Hamas]], which many governments have designated as  a terrorist organization, have been living at the International Red Cross office in [[Jerusalem]]. Israel believes that these three officials had a role in the 2006 kidnapping of Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]], and has issued deportation orders for them. Red Cross spokesperson Cecilia Goin, in speaking with [[Commonwealth Broadcasting Network|CBN]] News, said that hosting the Hamas officials is in line with the organization's humanitarian mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2011/March/Intl-Red-Cross-Aids-Hamas-Terrorist-Officials/|title=Int'l Red Cross Sheltering Hamas Terrorist Officials|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel arrested two of the Hamas members for conducting "Hamas activities inside Jerusalem," said the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/israeli-police-arrest-hamas-politicians-hiding-for-more-than-a-year-at%E2%80%A6the-red-cross/|title=Israeli Police Arrest Hamas Politicians Hiding for More Than a Year at…the Red Cross|author=Sharona Schwartz|work=The Blaze|accessdate=17 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109104006/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/israeli-police-arrest-hamas-politicians-hiding-for-more-than-a-year-at%E2%80%A6the-red-cross/|archive-date=9 November 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeremiah "Jerry" Cruncher''' is a fictional character in [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''.

==Overview==

'''Jeremiah "Jerry" Cruncher''' is employed as a ''porter'' for Tellson's Bank of London.  He earns extra money as a [[Resurrectionists in the United Kingdom|resurrection man]] removing bodies from their graves for sale to medical schools and students as cadavers.  During the story, Jerry Cruncher accompanies [[Jarvis Lorry]] and [[Lucie Manette]] to [[Paris]] to retrieve [[Dr. Alexandre Manette]]. Back in England, he helps [[Sydney Carton]] "get something" on the paid government witness and spy, [[John Barsad]]. He accompanies Lucie and [[Miss Pross]] to church the night they run into [[Sydney Carton]] and later that night Cruncher tries to unsuccessfully "resurrect" Barsad's colleague and fellow spy Roger Cly  in the graveyard. Later in [[Paris]], Jerry will remember that Cly was not in his coffin and will pass this information onto Carton who will use it to blackmail Barsad into getting Carton into the prison to rescue [[Charles Darnay]] who has been imprisoned by revolutionaries. Before leaving Paris, Cruncher will renounce grave robbing and resolve to be more gentle with his wife, toward whom he had been abusive physically and verbally.

==Cinematic and theatrical portrayals==

In the 1935 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film adaptation, Jerry Cruncher is portrayed by [[Billy Bevan]].

In the 2008 [[Broadway musical]] adaptation of '[[A Tale of Two Cities (musical)|A Tale of Two Cities]],' Jerry Cruncher was played by [[Craig Bennett]].

'''''Liwayway'''''&lt;ref name=Komiklopedia&gt;[http://komiklopedia.wordpress.com/2007/04/02/liwayway/ ''Liwayway''], Komiklopedia, The Philippine Komiks Encyclopedia, Komiklopedia.wordpress.com, April 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word meaning "dawn") is a leading Tagalog weekly magazine published in the [[Philippines]] since 1922. It contains Tagalog serialized novels, short stories, poetry, serialized comics, essays, news features, entertainment news and articles, and many others. In fact, it is the oldest Tagalog magazine in the Philippines. Its sister publications are ''[[Bannawag]]'', ''[[Bisaya Magasin]]'', and ''[[Hiligaynon (magazine)|Hiligaynon]]''.

==History==

The magazine had its beginning back 1922 when ''Don'' Ramon Roces, the eldest son of Ramon Roces, introduced it after the ill-fated [[Photo News]] had declined in the market.

''Don'' Ramon Roces, a prominent man in the publishing business, first conceived ''Photo News''. It was a magazine with its own style, carrying three languages ([[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[English language|English]]). The idea to have three languages in one magazine was to allow it to cater to all types of readers (Spanish and Spanish-speaking readers, English, American, and English-speaking readers, and Tagalog language and Filipino readers.

Unfortunately, the trilingual magazine was not well-received because some readers did not want to waste their money reading something they did not understand.

The sales of the magazine gradually declined and this emotionally affected ''Don'' Ramon Roces, but he did not give up. When he returned to Manila from Mindanao, he introduced another magazine patterned after ''Photo News''. Unlike ''Photo News'', the magazine concentrated, however,  on making Tagalog (now Filipino) its medium, and outpouring support from the reading public was felt when its maiden issue was finally launched in the market.

The magazine was named ''Liwayway'', meaning dawn. It made significant contribution to the field of literature when it introduced the popular masterpieces of great Filipino poets and writers like [[Jose Corazon de Jesus]], [[Florentino Collantes]], [[Julian Cruz Balmaceda]], [[Cecilio Apostol Borromeo]], [[Lope K. Santos]], [[Inigo Ed Regalado]], [[Romualdo Ramos]], [[Francisco Lacsamana]], [[Fausto Galauran]] and [[Pedrito Reyes]], the son of [[Severino Reyes]] who later succeeded him as the editor of ''Liwayway''.

''Liwayway'' became even more popular in the following years and ''Don'' Ramon Roces decided to launch sister magazines. This gave birth to other vernacular magazines like [[Bisaya]] in 1932, [[Hiligaynon (magazine) |Hiligaynon]], a [[Hiligaynon language]]-magazine for the Ilonggos and people of Western Visayas in 1934, [[Bikolano]] in 1935, and the Ilocano [[Bannawag]] in 1940. [[Liwayway Extra]] was also launched in 1936, a thicker monthly supplement of ''Liwayway''.

In 1945 during the Liberation of Manila, the combined US and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops to fought by the Japanese forces around the battles in the city, the Japanese Imperial Army took over the supervision of ''Liwayway'' and named it ''Manila Simbunsiya''. The Japanese military had hidden agenda: to use the magazine in their military campaign after occupying the Philippines. Later following that period, the ''Liwayway'' publication and its management was returned to ''Don'' Ramos Roces.

The publication was later sold to [[Hanz Menzi]] when old ''Don'' Ramon Roces retired from publishing business in 1965, but the sudden change in the management of the magazine had a severe impact on the magazine. Its sales declined until Menzi decided to sell the magazine to [[Manila Bulletin]] Publishing Corporation.

The management of the ''Manila Bulletin'' aimed to preserve the legacy of ''Liwayway'' while reformatting the magazine with its modern digital technology. Thus, a new image of ''Liwayway'' was born.

==New Image==

The magazine has a glossy colorful cover and pages were reduced down to 48; the size, however, is made bigger by 1&amp;nbsp;inch than the normal size of the old ''Liwayway''.

The content was also improved with novels by veteran writers like [[Efren Abueg]], [[Elena Patron]], [[Gilda Olvidado]], and [[Lualhati Bautista]]. It also carried work in different categories like [[Short Story]] (Maikling Kuwento), [[Children's Story]] (Kuwentong Pambata), [[Horror fiction|Horror Story]] (Kuwentong Kababalaghan), and Feature Stories (Lathalain). The comics series have been revived and works of popular and veteran writers like [[Pablo S. Gomez|Pablo Gomez]] and Rod Salandanan are the frontline, together with Sophia Esteban Resano whose horror stores are fast selling in the market.

Artworks of comic illustrators like Rico Rival, Jun Lofamia, Rod Lofamia, Rudy Villanueva, Abe Ocampo, Louie Celerio, and Alfred Manuel were revivals of their old comics series and their works have given a sense of nostalgia to modern ''Liwayway''.

==Trivia==

A prominent politician Liwayway Vinzons-Chato who became Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue during the administration of President Fidel Ramos was named after the magazine.

[[Image:Léonard (comic) 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Léonard est toujours un Génie'' (French for "Leonardo is still a genius"), book cover showing the two main protagonists of the series]]
'''''Léonard''''' in French, and '''''Leonardo''''' in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translation, is a [[Franco-Belgian comics|Belgian]] [[comics|comic]] series about an eponymous inventor and his assistant. It was created by [[comic book artist|artist]] [[Philippe Liégeois]] and writer [[Bob de Groot]], better known under their pennames "Turk &amp; De Groot".

==Publication history==
Inspired by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the character first appeared in ''[[Achille Talon|Achille Talon magazine]]'' in 1976 and, when that ended, he moved to ''[[Eppo (comics)|Eppo]]'' for the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] version and ''[[Pif gadget]]'' for the French. He later appeared in book form and has been drawn by the same duo for over 30 years with a similar number of books.

The stories are usually short ones ranging from one to half-a-dozen or so pages, though there have been the occasional full-length adventures.

All the albums have been published by [[Lombard Editions]] in [[Brussels, Belgium]], and by [[Dargaud]] in Paris, France. At least four albums have been translated into English, but all are currently out-of-print. The character name was changed to Leonardo. Titles include "Leonardo is a Genius", Leonardo is Still a Genius", "Leonardo:Non-stop Genius" and "Leonardo: Who is This Guy Anyway".

==Premise==
''Léonard'' is set in the early [[Renaissance]] period (with some aspects of the 20th century thrown in). He is an inventor and self-proclaimed genius who lives in a small town where he comes up with all sorts of inventions. Most of these are based on more recent, real-life achievements including television, [[fire extinguisher]]s, [[car]]s and [[airplane|plane]]s. He has also made more fanciful inventions like [[time travel|time machine]]s and [[robot]]s.

Léonard is flanked by Basile, his long-suffering (and often quite reluctant) assistant. Léonard refers to his younger helper as "[[Apprenticeship|Disciple]]" ("Lackey" in the English version), while Basile calls him "Master".

Basile shows, and not without good cause, little of the respect that Léonard feels due to him and their relationship is more one of squabbling worker and employer than that of pupil and mentor. One cannot really blame the Disciple given the Master's arrogance and oversized ego.

In fact, far from teaching his Disciple the ways of science, Léonard looks upon him as a convenient guinea-pig for his inventions and shows little sympathy when they go wrong, which they almost always do. Still, Léonard expects his Disciple to be enthusiastic about his inventions, and the resigned Disciple often ironically repeats his motto "I serve science and it's my joy" ''({{lang|fr|" Je sers la science et c'est ma joie "}})''.

==Storyline==
The most common storyline is that Léonard comes up with the idea for an invention. He then proceeds to wake up his late-sleeping Disciple using various means which range from loudspeakers to explosives. After being blown to bits or suffering similar injuries, the Disciple gets himself together and grudgingly proceeds to help build and test Léonard's latest idea. This invariably results in more damage to his body and soul, but failure to co-operate will result in him being on the receiving end of Léonard's [[anvil]] or [[blunderbuss]] which the Master keeps conveniently tucked up in his beard. The story often ends with the Disciple covered in plaster and bandages and even having to go to hospital.

==Other characters==
Looking on are Raoul the cat, Bernadette the mouse, and Mathurine the housekeeper. The cat and the mouse are friends and often appear in on-the-side gags: while the main action is being played out by Léonard and his Disciple, the cat and the mouse are involved in action of their own. Another recurring character is Crâne, a talking [[Human skull|skull]] who comments on the scene.

There is also a rival inventor, the Great Albert (based on [[Albert Einstein]]) who also has an assistant who is every bit as put-upon as Basile. Albert, who is in every way as brilliant and as arrogant as Léonard, first appeared in a full-length adventure entitled ''La Guerre des génies'' (French for "Genius Wars") – which included a chapter called "Le Génie contre-attaque" ("The Genius Strikes Back"). Deciding that the town was not big enough for two geniuses, he and Léonard engaged in a fiery feud with both of them coming up with increasingly devastating methods to try to get rid of the other. [[Running gag]]s in the story included the angry inhabitants chasing both Leonardo and Albert out of town and both men joining forces on occasion to get rid of another passing genius, [[Nicolas Flamel]], and his disciple. Although this story was entirely about the two fighting a huge battle, in later albums they are shown to be on more or less friendly terms.

==Cartoon series==
A pilot for a series was made at the beginning of the 1990s by the French cartoon company [[IDDH]], but the full series was never made.

A cartoon series with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] graphics was produced by [[Dargaud Media]]. It has been renamed '''Contraptus''' for the international market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mid.mediatoon.com/upload/flyers/uk_383.pdf Contraptus flyer at mediatoon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] has opened a broader inquiry into the origins, credibility and purpose of the memo.&lt;ref name="Mullen Memo Contrversy'"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abott|first=Sebastion|title=Pakistani Judicial Commission To Probe Memo Scandal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/12/30/world/asia/AP-AS-Pakistan.html?hp|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2012 a petition was submitted in the Supreme Court to arrest former Pakistan ambassador to US Husain Haqqani through [[Interpol]] for his refusal to return to Pakistan. On 12 June the supreme court commission released its findings and found that after testimony by all parties and verifying the forensic results of Ijaz's [[BlackBerry]] conversations with Haqqani it was "incontrovertibly established" that [[Husain Haqqani]] had written the memo and was being called back to Pakistan to face likely charges of [[treason]].

==Background and timeline==
{{see also|Death of Osama bin Laden|Military coups in Pakistan}}
[[File:US Navy 080827-N-9580K-016 Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen greets Pakistani Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Mullen|Admiral Mike Mullen]] greets Pakistani COAS, [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani|General Ashfaq Kayani]] (27 August 2008).]]

The US-Pakistan relationship was seemingly at an all-time low before the assault on [[Osama bin Laden]]'s compound in [[Abbottabad]] on 2 May 2011. Civilians and the media blamed the Pakistani armed forces for being unable to locate bin Laden's whereabouts and further criticised them for letting the United States conduct a unilateral operation on Pakistani soil, thereby prompting a furore over violation of Pakistani sovereignty by the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT-01"&gt;{{cite web

The raid on Bin Laden put the civilian government and military officials [[wikt:at loggerheads|at loggerheads]]. A meeting of the president, prime minister and the chief of army staff was called to discuss the issue in detail. The memorandum in question was allegedly written less than two days after the meeting was called, and a few days after the raid on the bin Laden compound.&lt;ref name="FT-01"&gt;{{cite web

The memo presented concerns that Pakistani military outfits might attempt to overthrow the civilian government in the wake of the Bin Laden raid.  To counteract these concerns the memo asks for US military and political help in wresting control of the government away from the military in what amounted to a counter-coup. It then goes on to make other offers favourable to the United States including: setting up tribunals with investigators picked by Washington to put the leaders of the military  on trial, the creation of a new security apparatus consisting of the authors of the memo and others favourable to Washington, and "carte blanche" for the US military in conducting strikes within Pakistan.&lt;ref name="MemoContents-FP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/111117_Ijaz%20memo%20Foreign%20Policy.PDF |title=Contents of the Mullen Memorandum |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112100525/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/111117_Ijaz%20memo%20Foreign%20Policy.PDF |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drafting the memo===
According to messages leaked online from [[Mansoor Ijaz]], Ambassador [[Husain Haqqani]] sent him a BlackBerry message on 9 May 2011, asking him to return a call to London, where the ambassador was residing at the Park Lane Intercontinental Hotel.&lt;ref name="GEO-05"&gt;{{cite web

 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The message further asked him to deliver a prompt proposal, initially verbally, for assistance to Admiral Mike Mullen.&lt;ref name="FT-01" /&gt; Ijaz, whose BlackBerry exchanges with Haqqani indicate he was in Monaco at the time, claims Haqqani then dictated the contents of what was to be relayed verbally in that first telephone call, lasting approximately 20 minutes, according to Ijaz's telephone records. Ijaz has further stated that his US interlocutors each insisted on a written memorandum because of consistent problems in the recent past with Pakistani officials making verbal offers that later, were not honoured. Ijaz then drafted, on the basis of Haqqani's instructions, the memorandum in question and confirmed the contents by telephone and over numerous [[BlackBerry Messenger]] conversations with the Pakistani ambassador.&lt;ref name="GEO-05" /&gt;

The following morning, Ijaz emailed a copy of the memo draft to the ambassador for proofreading and asked for assurances that the memo had the approval of the [[president of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="GEO-05" /&gt; Shortly after a meeting with British delegates at [[10 Downing Street]], Haqqani read the proof for the final proposal and asked for it to be delivered immediately to Mullen through a US interlocutor, later named as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[James L. Jones]], former NATO commander and US national security adviser to President Barack Obama.&lt;ref name="GEO-05" /&gt; Prior to delivering the memorandum, Ijaz made clear that his military go between, Jones, the man who would deliver the memorandum to Mullen, required assurances that the document had clearance from the highest office in Pakistan, upon which Haqqani allegedly responded by telephone "he had the boss' approval".&lt;ref name="GEO-05" /&gt;

===Contents of the memo===
[[File:Ijaz with Gen. Jones, Bagram Air Base, October 2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ijaz with Gen. Jones at Bagram Air Base in Oct. 2006]]
Content of the confidential memo were published in its entirety on ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine's website on 17 November.&lt;ref name="MemoContents-FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MemoContents-WP"/&gt; The memo was addressed to Michael Mullen, and requested the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] to convey a "strong, urgent and direct message to General Kayani and General Pasha"&lt;ref name="Request4Intervention"&gt;{{cite web

The memo then makes certain explicit offers to the United States government in exchange for its support. These include the following quoted directly from the memo:

{{quote|In the event Washington's direct intervention behind the scenes can be secured through your personal communication with Kayani (he will likely listen only to you at this moment) to stand down the Pakistani military-intelligence establishment, the new national security team is prepared, with full backing of the civilian apparatus, to do the following:

1. [[President of Pakistan]] will order an independent inquiry into the allegations that Pakistan harboured and offered assistance to UBL and other senior Qaeda operatives. The White House can suggest names of independent investigators to populate the panel, along the lines of the bipartisan [[9-11 Commission]], for example.

2. The inquiry will be accountable and independent, and result in findings of tangible value to the US government and the American people that identify with exacting detail those elements responsible for harbouring and aiding UBL inside and close to the inner ring of influence in Pakistan s Government (civilian, intelligence directorates and military). It is certain that the UBL Commission will result in immediate termination of active service officers in the appropriate government offices and agencies found responsible for complicity in assisting UBL.

3. The new national security team will implement a policy of either handing over those left in the leadership of Al Qaeda or other affiliated terrorist groups who are still on Pakistani soil, including [[Ayman Al Zawahiri]], [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] and [[Sirajuddin Haqqani]], or giving US military forces a "green light" to conduct the necessary operations to capture or kill them on Pakistani soil. This "carte blanche" guarantee is not without political risks, but should demonstrate the new group's commitment to rooting out bad elements on our soil. This commitment has the backing of the top echelon on the civilian side of our house, and we will insure necessary collateral support.

4. One of the great fears of the military-intelligence establishment is that with your stealth capabilities to enter and exit Pakistani airspace at will, Pakistan's nuclear assets are now legitimate targets. The new national security team is prepared, with full backing of the Pakistani government – initially civilian but eventually all three power centres – to develop an acceptable framework of discipline for the nuclear program. This effort was begun under the previous military regime, with acceptable results. We are prepared to reactivate those ideas and build on them in a way that brings Pakistan's nuclear assets under a more verifiable, transparent regime.

5. The new national security team will eliminate Section S of the ISI charged with maintaining relations to the [[Taliban]], [[Haqqani network]], etc. This will dramatically improve relations with Afghanistan.

6. We are prepared to co-operate fully under the new national security team s guidance with the Indian government on bringing all perpetrators of Pakistani origin to account for the 2008 [[Mumbai]] attacks, whether outside government or inside any part of the government, including its intelligence agencies. This includes handing over those against whom sufficient evidence exists of guilt to the Indian security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ijaz memo Foreign Policy|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/111117_Ijaz%20memo%20Foreign%20Policy.PDF|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ijaz's claims in ''The Financial Times''===
On 10 October 2011, Ijaz wrote a column in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' revealing and confirming that he had helped deliver to Admiral Mullen a memorandum drafted by a Pakistani official stationed in the United States at the behest of President Zardari.&lt;ref name="FT-01" /&gt; The op-ed did not explicitly name Haqqani as being the author of the memo. This disclosure fuelled a frenzy in the Pakistani media while American press has largely remained silent in regards to any official US support of the plan. The affair became the buzz of front pages in Pakistan when Mullen admitted after previous denials that he had received the confidential memorandum soon after the raid on the bin Laden compound.&lt;ref name="FT-01" /&gt; Local media speculated as to the identity of the memo's author.

===Admiral Mullen's statement===
When asked whether he received the memo in May, Admiral [[Michael Mullen|Mullen]] said he had no knowledge of the memo&lt;ref name="FP-06"&gt;{{cite web

|date=22 November 2011
|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby stated in a press briefing that Mullen "does not know" and had "never communicated with Mr Ijaz".&lt;ref name="ECT-01" /&gt;

Ostensibly the memo reached Mullen without any government seal or signature. Kirby suggested that "nothing about the letter had the [[imprimatur]] on the Pakistani government" and thus Mullen never acted on it.&lt;ref name="ECT-01" /&gt; This initially led to debates in the Pakistani media as to the authenticity and credibility of the memorandum and has grown now to the resignation of Haqqani and a full investigation by the Pakistani supreme court.

A news report in the Pakistani press&lt;ref name="TheNews-03"&gt;{{cite web
|title=Mullen was pushed to issue wrong denial by Haqqani

|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysing the origins of the Mullen denial stated that the Mullen denial "was said to be the consequence of Husain Haqqani's persuasion, as the former ambassador had intimated about this well before Mullen's first reaction". The timeline of released Blackberry messages, the Financial Times article by Ijaz in October, and phone records released during the Supreme Court investigation all indicate that communication and possible action supporting a coup in Pakistan continued long after the offer was made in May 2011.&lt;ref name="ECT-01" /&gt;

===Speculations about Haqqani's involvement===
In a rally at [[Minar-e-Pakistan]] in Lahore on 30 October 2011, [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] chairman [[Imran Khan]] accused Haqqani of involvement in the Mullen memo.&lt;ref name="IT-01"&gt;{{cite web

On 17 November 2011, the contents of the memorandum were made public on the ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' website&lt;ref name="MemoContents-FP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MemoContents-WP"/&gt; and later in a local Pakistani newspaper, escalating rapidly to a scandal amongst the local media.&lt;ref name="FT-02"&gt;{{cite web

===Haqqani's Recall and Resignation===
In the wake of the release of the memo's contents Ambassador Haqqani was recalled from Washington to Pakistan. On 22 November 2011, an official meeting took place at the Prime Minister House in Islamabad between President [[Asif Ali Zardari]], Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]], Chief of Army Staff [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]], Director General of ISI [[Ahmad Shuja Pasha]], and Ambassador Haqqani. This meeting over the affairs of the memorandum was watched closely as many felt that the fallout could continue to claim victims, while in the press rumours of coups and actions by the military continued.&lt;ref name="FP-02"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Haqqani tendered his resignation, which was accepted by the prime minister. To the media outlets and the general public in Pakistan, this came as no surprise, but was rather the expected outcome of the planned meeting.&lt;ref name="FP-02" /&gt;

===Revelations in ''Newsweek''===
The Pakistani media discussed the fallout of the revelation of the memo's existence. ''[[Newsweek Pakistan]]'' published in its 2 December 2011 issue (published online Friday, 25 November) a limited account&lt;ref name="NEWSWEEK-01"&gt;{{cite web

==Official responses==

===Government of Pakistan===

* When asked about the matter, US National Security Adviser Tom Donilon stated "I don't have a way to comment from this distance. I just don't have a way to comment on that from this distance at this point", while insisting that the United States and Pakistan shared a "critically important" relationship.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
* Similarly, at a daily press briefing on 18 November 2011, US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner stated "this is – I understand this is a big story in Pakistan.

==Pakistani media responses==
The Pakistani media has been largely split along lines of support and opposition for the current government, with narratives and coverage of the event varying wildly. The Pakistani paper ''The News'' created a web page dedicated to daily updates of the investigation and regularly used the term 'treasonous' in reference to the memo's contents and intentions of those involved.&lt;ref name="Mullen Memo Contrversy'"/&gt; While [[Cyril Almeida]] argued in January: "What we're seeing right now is farcical.

Founded in 1994 by filmmakers [[Todd Phillips]] (''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'') and Andrew Gurland, the '''New York Underground Film Festival''' was an annual event that occurred each March at [[Anthology Film Archives]] in [[New York City]] from 1994 through 2008. After Phillips and Gurland turned the festival over to programmer [[Ed Halter]] (now an author and occasional critic for the ''[[Village Voice]]''), it became noted for [[Documentary film|documentary]] and [[experimental film]] programming, and occasionally courted controversy, particularly in its early years.

Some of these have included: premiering the [[North American Man/Boy Love Association]] (NAMBLA) documentary, ''[[Chicken Hawk: Men Who Love Boys]]'', in 1994; premiering a film in 1995 that accused [[Quentin Tarantino]] of plagiarism; being protested by Reverend [[Fred Phelps]] in 2002 (apparently for not choosing to show a film about Phelps); and premiering a theatrical version of Brad Neely's [[Harry Potter]] parody ''[[Wizard People, Dear Reader]]'', which eventually led to action by [[Warner Brothers]] to suppress future theatrical performances of the work.

Nevertheless, though the festival has remained a small affair, and has little value as a market, its programming has attained a certain prestige, especially among younger or more experimental filmmakers.  The first year showcased the work of Independent Animator Bill Plympton.  The New York Times described the event " as a collection of love and independence".

In February 2008 the festival organizers announced that, instead of passing on the torch to a younger generation - as has been the tradition, the 15th festival would be the last. Instead two of the former organizers intend to create a new festival under the name Migrating Forms (taking the name from a film by [[James Fotopoulos]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1778">'''PAN truncation''' is an anti-fraud measure available on some credit-card-processing [[point of sale]] (POS) terminals as part of a [[merchant account]] service.

"PAN" is an acronym for [[Bank card number|primary account number]], i.e., the "card number" on either a [[Debit card|debit]] or a [[credit card]]. ''PAN truncation'' simply replaces the card number printed on a customer receipt with a printout of only the last four digits, the remainder being replaced usually by [[asterisk]]s. This hides the card number from anyone who obtains the receipt when discarded, or by other means, while still allowing a card holder with multiple cards to identify which was used, and thus accurately record the transaction.

PAN truncation is a measure to combat [[credit card fraud]] (and [[debit card]] fraud), which is increasing worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.experian.co.uk/blogs/latest-thinking/2013/04/credit-card-fraud-continues-to-rise/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501133042/http://www.experian.co.uk/blogs/latest-thinking/2013/04/credit-card-fraud-continues-to-rise/ |archivedate=2013-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in a global market where [[Card not present transaction|card not present]] (CNP) transactions are increasingly{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} popular over the [[Internet]], by [[mail]], and by [[telephone]].

{{Short description|the ability to control the dissemination of personal information after death}}
{{Use American English|date=September 2018}}

'''Post-mortem privacy''' refers to a person's ability to control the dissemination of personal information after [[death]]. No [[federal law]]s specifically extend [[post-mortem]] [[privacy protection]]. At the state level, [[privacy law]]s pertaining to the deceased vary significantly, but in general do not extend any clear rights of privacy beyond property rights. The relative lack of acknowledgment of post-mortem privacy rights has sparked major controversy in recent years with rapid technological advancements that have resulted in exponential growth in the amount of personal information that is stored and instantly shared online.&lt;ref name="Banta2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berg2001" /&gt;

== Law ==

=== United States ===
{{See also|Privacy laws of the United States}}
Under [[common law]], the [[right to privacy]] is considered a [[Personal rights|personal right]], meaning it applies only to the living and, consequently, does not recognize the privacy interests of the deceased. Because of this, defamation and privacy [[tort]]s that are used to prevent unjust damage to individuals' reputations cannot be extended post-mortem.&lt;ref name="Banta2016"&gt;Banta, Natalie M. 2016. "Death and privacy in the digital age." ''North Carolina Law Review'', 3: 958. Retrieved October 12, 2017 (InfoTrac LegalTrac, EBSCOhost).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a family cannot file suit for invasion of privacy on behalf of a deceased relative as a personal right; it can only be exerted by the person whose rights are being infringed upon. In addition, the deceased do not qualify for privacy protections held in [[Constitutional right|constitutional]] and [[statutory right]]s, such as those noted in the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]].&lt;ref name="Banta2016" /&gt; Judicial justification for the termination of privacy rights at death is centered on two main points: firstly, the deceased can no longer be active agents, and secondly, the deceased are incapable of being harmed by invasion of privacy or defamation.&lt;ref name="Banta2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buitelaar, J. 2017. [null “Post-mortem privacy and informational self-determination.”] ''Ethics &amp; Information'' ''Technology'', 19(2):129.&lt;/ref&gt; The only clear extension of postmortem privacy rights under federal law are those pertaining to property. Via Will, private property and some personal information can be passed on to heirs in accordance with the decedent's wishes.

Most post-mortem privacy protection occurs on the state level. Thus, legislation and the degree of protection varies widely from state to state.

=== Relevant court cases  ===
''Jesse James, Jr. v. Screen Gems Inc.'' established that rights of privacy do not survive death. The widow of [[Jesse James, Jr.]] filed suit against [[Screen Gems]] on behalf of her late husband, claiming the use of his name in a documentary was an invasion of his privacy. The court decided her claim was insufficient because it only applied to her husband.&lt;ref name="Fennimore2012"&gt;Fennimore, Keenan C. 2012. "Reconciling California's Pre, Post, and Per Mortem Rights of Publicity." ''Indiana International &amp; Comparative Law Review'' 22(2): 377-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical confidentiality  ==
{{See also|Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|Physician–patient privilege}}
Medical confidentiality is upheld through both state and federal law. Because state legislation varies considerably, Congress passed explicit [[medical privacy]] regulations in 2000 under the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).&lt;ref name="Berg2001"&gt;Berg, Jessica W. 2001. "Grave secrets: legal and ethical analysis of postmortem confidentiality.” ''Connecticut Law Review,'' (1):81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the act only briefly mentions postmortem privacy rights, stating that all protection ceases two years after death.&lt;ref name="Berg2001" /&gt; Moreover, no legal mandate exists regarding patients' wishes after death. During life, informed consent is the basis for managing patient medical history. However, since informed consent is no longer possible post-mortem, confidential medical information is at risk of being exploited in a number of ways. First, highly sensitive information, such as genetic information, potential health factors, or diseases, can be easily disseminated in a way the patient may not have wanted. In addition, legal consent for research on a patient's biological material no longer applies to deceased individuals, allowing such research to be conducted on deceased patients without requiring permission.&lt;ref name="Moore2016"&gt;Moore, Quianta L., Mary A. Majumder, Lindsey K.Rutherford, et al. 2016. [null "Ethical and Legal Challenges] Associated with Public Molecular Autopsies." ''Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics,'' 44(2): 309-318.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dissemination of [[autopsy]] records has become a significant issue in recent years. State legislation dictating the dissemination of autopsy records can be characterized into three groups: those prioritizing confidentiality, those prioritizing complete transparency, and a middle ground that limits some aspects of disclosure for privacy protection.&lt;ref name="Moore2016" /&gt; The inconsistencies surrounding this legislation also have the potential to expose very personal medical information that can also affect the living relatives of a patient. For example, certain genetic diseases that the patient's family does not want known to the public could be exposed, which can lead to raising health insurance premiums and employment difficulties.

=== Case of Henrietta Lacks ===
[[Henrietta Lacks]] was an African American woman whose cells were removed without consent while receiving cancer treatment. Her cells became the source of the foundational [[HeLa|HeLa cell line]] in the scientific world today.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Jones, D. Gareth. "[null Genetic privacy and the use of archival human material in genetic studies - current] perspectives." ''Medicolegal &amp; Bioethics,'' 5:43-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacks and her family were neither informed nor asked for consent to the use of her cells for this research. It was not until the 1980s when Lacks's medical records were made public, exposing the rest of her family's medical information as well as the fact that her family was never informed of this.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The major issue surrounding the Lacks case is twofold. Firstly, at no point was consent sought for the extraction and research on Lacks's cells. Secondly, her family never received compensation for the commercial use of the HeLa cell line.

== Autopsy and death scene photographs ==
Under the [[Due Process Clause]], family members generally maintain the right to control dissemination of photos of deceased relatives. Privacy rights in this context  only extend to the privacy of the living relatives of the decedent, not the actual deceased.&lt;ref name="Siddiqui2014"&gt;Siddiqui, Mahira. 2014. [null “Narrowly Restricting “clearly Established” Civil Liberties: The ConstitutionalRamifications of a Family Member’s [under]protected Federal Privacy Rights in the Dissemination of Postmortem Images in ''Marsh v. County of San Diego''.”] ''Golden Gate University Law Review'', 44(1): 81-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Most court rulings regarding autopsy and death scene photos have looked to the precedent set by the federal [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA), which determines under which circumstances the release of such images is appropriate and not invasive of any living person's privacy.&lt;ref name="Siddiqui2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Terilli2005"&gt;Terilli, Samuel A., and Sigman L. Splichal. 2005. "[null Public Access to Autopsy and Death-scene Photographs: Relational Privacy, Public Records and Avoidable Collisions."] ''Communication Law &amp; Policy,'' 10(3): 313-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case of Emmett Till ===
While most families wish to conceal the images of their deceased loved ones, [[Mamie Till|Mamie Till Bradley]], mother of [[Emmett Till]], decided to make the photos of her brutally murdered son public in spite of officials' attempts to ignore the event.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Harold, Christine, and Kevin Michael DeLuca. [null "Behold the Corpse: Violent Images and the Case of] Emmett Till." Rhetoric and Public Affairs, 8(2): 263-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The photos exposed the horrendous realities of racial injustice in America during the time and became a rallying call for many influential civil rights figures, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]. Moreover, the images forced all Americans to confront the deep-rooted racism in America despite many white Americans’ attempts to remain ignorant to the despicable happenings, especially in the South.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Relevant court cases ===
In ''[[New York Times Company]] v. [[NASA]]'', the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|D.C. District Court]] denied the ''[[New York Times]]''{{'}} request under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)]] for access to audio recordings of the astronauts involved in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' explosion]] moments before the event. The major argument of the case came down to weighing public interest and the decedents' families, and the court ruled in favor of protecting the decedents' families, claiming that exposing the tapes could cause relatives of the astronauts trauma.&lt;ref name="Terilli2005" /&gt;

''[[National Archives and Records Administration]] v. Favish'' similarly found that under FOIA, the privacy rights of a decedents' relatives are both acknowledged and prioritized when disseminating autopsy/death scene photos of the deceased. This decision was made in regards to the death scene photos of [[Vince Foster|Vincent Foster]], a deputy counsel to [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="Terilli2005" /&gt;

''Marsh v. County of San Diego'' determined that a prosecutor who photocopied and then released an autopsy photo of a deceased child after his retirement could not be sued under the Doctrine of Qualified Immunity. A major point in the case was whether or not Brenda Marsh had the legal right to control the dissemination of her son's autopsy photos, and though the court determined that she did, it ruled on a technicality that at the time of the events, the law had not yet been "clearly established." &lt;ref name="Siddiqui2014" /&gt;

== Digital assets ==
{{See also|Digital inheritance}}
The past decade has seen an unprecedented amount of data being stored in online accounts. Because of the relative newness of this phenomenon, no legal mandate exists for how a person's digital assets are to be handled after death. Terms of Service Agreements between the user and the service provider remain the closest variant to this available.&lt;ref name="Banta2016" /&gt; In order to maintain their users' privacy protection, many of these agreements make it very difficult for third parties to access such online accounts once the user has died. [[Yahoo! Mail|Yahoo!]], for example, states in its terms of service agreement that the account will be permanently deleted upon the user's death.&lt;ref name="Lopez2016"&gt;Lopez, Alberto B. 2016. "Posthumous Privacy, Decedent Intent, and Post-Mortem Access to Digital Assets." ''George Mason Law Review,'' 24(1): 183.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google]] requires a lengthy process that involves getting a court order to obtain content from a deceased user's account. There is also an option to allow someone to manage the account, make it inactive, or delete it altogether once the user has died.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Barwick, Elizabeth D. "All Blogs go to Heaven: Preserving Valuable Digital Assets Without the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act's Removal of Third Party Privacy Protections." ''Georgia Law Review'' 50, (2): 593-624.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] has allowed for the memorialization of deceased users' accounts, which aims to maintain the privacy of the user while allowing friends and family to still interact with the account. Requesting information from the account is a long and difficult process.  Recently{{When|date=January 2018}}, the company updated its policy to allow for "legacy contact," wherein the user can appoint someone to take over their account once they die. The new policy also offers the option for the account to be permanently deleted upon death.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The rigid policies of service providers has become increasingly problematic as online transactions and data storage have become more popular, and personal representatives have consequently found an increasing need to access online accounts in order to carry out estate transfers and Will orders. States began proposing legislation to address this problem in the early 2000s, and legislation favoring access to decedents' accounts became overwhelmingly supported.  Delaware's Access to Digital Assets Act is an example of such legislation already passed at the state level, which grants family members of deceased individuals full access to online accounts and profiles.&lt;ref&gt;Gaied, Melissa. 2016. [null "Data after death: an examination into heirs' access to a decedent's private online] account." ''Suffolk University Law Review'', 2: 281. Retrieved  October 12, 2017 (InfoTrac LegalTrac, EBSCOhost).&lt;/ref&gt; However, stringent terms of service agreements by service providers still make access to accounts very difficult in most cases. Thus, two major contemporary legislative proposals have come forth to address the issue. In July 2014, the [[Uniform Law Commission]] (ULC) proposed the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (UFADAA) to provide fiduciaries easy access to the digital accounts of their deceased clients. Twenty-six states proposed legislation based on the UFADAA; however, such legislation failed in all but one state.&lt;ref name="Lopez2016" /&gt; In response to this, NetChoice, a major rival to ULC, proposed the Privacy Expectation Afterlife Choices Act (PEAC), which included much more stringent guidelines for giving fiduciaries access to digital accounts and was overall considered to be much more privacy-centric. Only four states had proposed PEAC legislation in 2014, and only Virginia actually implemented it in 2015.&lt;ref name="Lopez2016" /&gt; Shortly after passing the UFADAA, the ULC passed a revised version (RUFADAA). This new legislative proposal incorporated more privacy centered aspects that aligned more with those of PEAC, which even gained it the support of NetChoice. Moreover, thirty-one states proposed legislation in accordance with the RUFADAA. However, critics of the new legislation contest that its transformation still not does give much consideration to a decedent's post-mortem privacy of the information kept in their account.&lt;ref name="Lopez2016" /&gt;

== Celebrity images and persona ==
=== Post-mortem publicity rights ===
The [[right of publicity]] was created as an extension of the right of privacy. It was developed with the intent to provided unique privacy rights to celebrities or anyone whose persona or name had commercial value.&lt;ref name="Decker2009" /&gt; Because these people are constantly in the public eye, general rights of privacy are oftentimes not applicable, thus publicity rights accommodate this situation. The right of publicity essentially grants a person the right to control the portrayal of themselves in the public eye, specifically in regard to commercial use.&lt;ref name="Decker2009"&gt;Decker, Michael. 2009. [null "Goodbye, Norma Jean: Marilyn Monroe and the Right of Publicity's] Transformation at Death." ''Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal,'' 27(1): 243.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Copyright laws]], aimed at protecting the ownership rights of original works, contain a significant amount of overlap with publicity rights. Much like post-mortem privacy rights, no blatant federal rights of publicity have been established, leaving recognition up to individual states. Whether states have laws regarding post-mortem publicity is dependent upon whether the state classifies the right as a privacy right or a property right. If classified as a personal right, states will not recognize post-mortem rights of publicity due to the stipulation that personal rights only apply to the living. If classified as a property right, then the upkeep and transfer of publicity rights follow a similar tract as that of property.&lt;ref name="Fennimore2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hicks2012"&gt;Hicks, Aubrie. 2012[null "The right to publicity after death: post mortem personality rights in Washington in] the wake [null of Experience Hendrix v. HendrixLicensing.com]." ''Seattle University Law Review'', (1): 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Most states acknowledge a specific duration for post-mortem publicity rights, which generally range between forty and one hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Smolensky, Kirsten Rabe. 2009. "Rights of the Dead." ''Hofstra Law Review,'' 37(3): 763-804.&lt;/ref&gt; Because post-mortem publicity rights vary from state to state, court precedent has determined that when establishing a person's post-mortem publicity rights, the legislation of the state in which the decedent lived must be adhered to.&lt;ref name="Decker2009" /&gt;

=== Relevant court cases ===
''Haelan Laboratories, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc.'' established the right of publicity, granting individuals control of the commercial use of their identity.&lt;ref name="Fennimore2012" /&gt;

''Shaw Family Archives Ltd. v. CMG Worldwide, Inc.'' determined that Marilyn Monroe's estate did not own her post-mortem right of publicity because neither state of  her residency, New York nor California, recognized post-mortem rights of publicity.&lt;ref name="Decker2009" /&gt;

In ''Experience Hendrix v. HendrixLicensing.com,'' Al Hendrix, despite being his son's sole heir, was denied the acquisition of Jimi Hendrix's publicity rights due to the fact that New York, at the time, did not acknowledge post-mortem publicity rights''. ''&lt;ref name="Hicks2012" /&gt;

=== Controversy ===
The use of deceased celebrities' likenesses has sparked controversy, mainly regarding the potential for their image to be used in a way that is inconsistent with that celebrity's desire. This can occur through the use of a celebrity's image for advertising a product, service, or any other recreation of celebrity likeness for commercial, or noncommercial, use in a way that the celebrity would otherwise not agree to during their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Smith2013"&gt;Smith, Shannon Flynn1. 2013. "If it Looks Like Tupac, Walks Like Tupac, and Raps Like Tupac, it's Probably Tupac: Virtual Cloning and Postmortem Right-of-Publicity Implications." ''Michigan State Law Review'', (5): 1719-1761.&lt;/ref&gt; This then raises questions about a potential violation of that celebrity's privacy because of the use of an individual's image without their consent. This can be seen in the 2012 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] concert, which featured a digital recreation of [[Tupac Shakur]]. The virtual clone performed on stage, rapping a song never recorded by Tupac during his life.&lt;ref name="Smith2013" /&gt; The use of such digital cloning and other similar recreations of celebrities could become a serious privacy concern in that those being reproduced have no control over how they are being represented. Discretion regarding the use of such digital personas is entirely up to whomever owns the right to that celebrity's image, which inevitably opens up the possibility that the decedent's interest is not being prioritized.&lt;ref name="Smith2013" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2679">'''Sir Richard Walsh''' was an English politician who served as [[High Sheriff of Worcestershire]] and is noted for his role in defeating [[Robert Catesby]]'s remaining followers at [[Holbeche House]] following the failure of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]. He came from [[Shelsley Walsh]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worcestershireregiment.com/wr.php?main=inc/bat_worcs_militia|title=The Worcestershire Militia (871 to 1886)|last=|first=|date=|website=Worcestershire Regiment|publisher=|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gunpowder Plot ==
After [[Guy Fawkes]] was captured in the basement of the Houses of Parliament, many of his fellow plotters, under the leadership of [[Robert Catesby]], fled to the Midlands. Walsh and his 200-strong force began following the conspirators after they entered [[Worcestershire]] and caught up with them at [[Holbeche House]] in [[Staffordshire]] on 8 November. Among those in Walsh's force was John Streete, the noted marksman from Worcester, who at one point killed two plotters with a single shot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/herefordandworcester/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8292000/8292194.stm|title=Gunpowder plot and Worcestershire|last=|first=|date=6 October 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=5 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/gunpoweder-treason-plotpart-2/story-20155464-detail/story.html|title=Gunpoweder, Treason and Plot|last=Jasper|first=Josephine|date=10 May 2013|work=Black Country Bugle|access-date=5 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/1817756.Remember___Herefordshire_s_part_in_treason_plot/|title=Remember - Herefordshire's part in treason plot|last=|first=|date=8 November 2007|work=Worcester News|access-date=5 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conspirators made two major errors: they got their gunpowder wet and then tried to dry it in front of the fire, causing it to blow up. Walsh invited the conspirators to surrender, and upon their refusal ordered an assault of the building. All of the conspirators were either captured or killed. Catesby was killed, as were the [[John and Christopher Wright]] and [[Thomas Percy (Gunpowder Plot)|Thomas Percy]], but [[Ambrose Rookwood]] was captured alive and later held in Worcester gaol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Schlosstheater Schönbrunn''' (Schönbrunn Palace Theatre) is a stage at [[Schönbrunn Palace]] in Vienna which opened in 1747. The Baroque theatre now serves for the training of students of acting and opera, and for performances of the '''Musik Theater Schönbrunn'''.

== History ==
In the 17th century, theatrical performances were held occasionally at the park of Schloss Schönbrunn. [[Maria Theresa]] commissioned [[Nicolò Pacassi]] in 1745 to build an imperial theatre in a wing of the palace, as one of the first palace theatres in Europe.&lt;ref name="MDW" /&gt; It was opened on 4 October 1747, the [[name day]] of her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref name="Friehs" /&gt;

The empress, who appeared in opera and theatre, watched her children perform in ''[[tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]]''. The theatre first served the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] court exclusively.&lt;ref name="MDW" /&gt; Members of the Court Opera performed at the theatre.&lt;ref name="Biba" /&gt; Operas by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] premiered there, ''[[L'arbre enchanté]]'' in 1759, and ''[[Il Parnaso confuso]]'' in 1765.&lt;ref name="ÖAW" /&gt; [[Joseph Haydn]] conducted performances of the Esterhazy orchestra in 1777.&lt;ref name="ÖAW" /&gt;

When [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] had his headquarters in Schönbrunn, he renovated the theatre. It was reopened in 1809 with Jean Racine's ''[[Phèdre]]''.&lt;ref name="MDW" /&gt; Singers of the [[Theater am Kärntnertor]] appeared for emperors and kings during the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Under [[Ferdinand I of Austria]], the theatre flourished again, with plays performed by the ensemble of the [[Burgtheater]].&lt;ref name="ÖAW" /&gt;  In 1898, the palace and theatre were electrified.&lt;ref name="MDW" /&gt;

Before World War I, the building was used as storage for furniture,&lt;ref name="Friehs" /&gt; but after the imperial belongings were stolen in 1919, plays were again performed during the summer by the Burgtheater, directed by [[Albert Heine]], until 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{ANNO|nwb|24|12|1918|06|AUTOR=|Theater, Kunst und Musik. Ein zweites Burgtheater|ZUSATZ=Nr. 294/1918 (XLV. Jahrgang)|ALTSEITE=6 Mitte.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the Schlosstheater was given to the [[Max Reinhardt Seminar]] as a rehearsal stage, which has used it, together with the opera department of the Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst, from October to June.&lt;ref name="MDW" /&gt;

The building underwent major restoration in 1979/80.&lt;ref name="ÖAW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arbeiter" /&gt;&lt;!-- The theatre was restored again in 2010. --&gt;

The '''Serbian National Theatre''' ({{lang-sr|Српско народно позориште}} / ''Srpsko narodno pozorište''), located in [[Novi Sad]], is one of the major theatres of [[Serbia]].

==History==
The current building of the theatre was opened in March 1981. The Serbian National Theatre was founded in 1861 during a conference of the Serbian National Theatre Society, composed of members of the Serbian Reading Room (''Srpska čitaonica''), held in Novi Sad. The first general manager of the Serbian National Theatre was [[Jovan Đorđević]]. The founding fathers were: Dr. Jovan Andrejević-Joles, [[Svetozar Miletić]], [[Stevan Branovački]], [[Jovan Jovanović Zmaj]], [[Jovan Đorđević]], [[Dimitrije Ružić]], [[Dimitrije Marković Kikinđanin]], Nikola Nedeljković, [[Kosta Hadžić]], [[Mihailo Gavrilović]], [[Mihailo Racković]], [[Mladen Cvijić]], [[Stevan Čekić]] and [[Draginja Popović-Ružić]].

An annual theatre festival [[Sterijino pozorje]] is held in Serbian National Theatre since 1956.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:CollinsOrganConsole.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|The console of the Peter Collins organ built for the [[St Albans International Organ Festival]].]] --&gt;
The '''International Organ Festival''' (IOF) is a biennial music festival and organ competition held in [[St Albans]], [[England]] since 1963.  Originally held annually, it was changed to every two years in 1965 due to the complexity of organising the increasingly ambitious programme.  The festival is run mainly by volunteers.

==Background==
The festival was conceived by [[Peter Hurford]] to celebrate the building of the new organ in [[St Albans Cathedral]] by [[Harrison &amp; Harrison]]. The main competitions are still conducted on this instrument, its eclectic style and modern electropneumatic action now complemented by another self-contained [[tracker action]] instrument which The International Organ Festival Society, the charity which runs the Festival, has had built for its own use and sited at St Saviour's Church, St Albans.  This was built by [[Peter Collins (organ builder)|Peter Collins]] in the style of, and in homage to, the early 18th century German organ builder [[Andreas Silbermann]]. There is a new (2005) organ in [[St. Peter's Church, St. Albans|St Peter's Church, St Albans]] by [[Mander Organs]], which has played a role in the festival and competitions since 2007.

There are two main competitions, the '''interpretation competition''' and the '''improvisation competition''' (formerly known as the '''Tournemire Prize''').  Judges have included [[Piet Kee]], [[Marie-Claire Alain]], [[Anton Heiller]], [[Ralph Downes]], [[Thomas Trotter]], [[Ton Koopman]], [[Naji Hakim]], [[Daniel Roth (organist)|Daniel Roth]] and [[David Sanger (organist)|David Sanger]].  The competition is considered prestigious, as may be judged by the list of past winners, and judges have occasionally decided not to award first prize.

Alongside the festival there is an exhibition of organs by the major British organ builders, and during the week there are demonstration recitals played on these.

The main concert series includes large orchestral and choral works, solo performances, and cabaret in the evenings.  Many of the great orchestras (the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]] and others) have played in the Festival, and there have been recitals and concerts from performers such as [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]], [[Sarah Walker (opera singer)|Sarah Walker]], [[Musica Antiqua Köln]], [[Evelyn Glennie]], [[Emma Kirkby]], [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]] and [[Julian Perkins]].  Concerts have sometimes been broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]]. Most of the concerts take place in the Cathedral, but some take place in St Saviour's.

The artistic directors have almost all been the Master of the Music of the Cathedral from the time of the founding of the festival by Peter Hurford until today. The current Artistic Director is David Titterington, professor of organ at the Royal Academy of Music.

The 2007 Festival (which took place 12–20 July) featured organists [[Ludger Lohmann]], David Titterington, Lynne Davis, [[Paul Jacobs (organist)|Paul Jacobs]], Martin Baker (all Jury Members) and Simon Johnson and Richard Pinel; the choirs of St Albans Cathedral, [[Choir of St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College, Cambridge]], [[Saint Thomas Church (New York City)|St Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, NYC]]; St Albans Abbey Girls' Choir, St Albans Bach Choir, Black Voices, the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]; Sinfonia Verdi; solo artists [[Catherine Bott]] and [[John Lill]]; and conductors [[John Scott (organist)|John Scott]], [[David Hill (choral director)|David Hill]] and Andrew Lucas.

== The building ==

The '''Tecumseh Opera House''' is a brick structure measures 76 feet wide by 80 feet wide. The roof is pitched and tar-covered and has sustained significant water damage, but it was repaired. Access to the second-floor auditorium is only by way of a wide staircase, at the top the ticket counter that was there has been removed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;National Register of Historic Places, Tecumseh Opera House, Tecumseh, Nebraska, National Register #J007-53&lt;/ref&gt;

The auditorium of the '''Tecumseh Opera House''' stands 30 feet wide by 60 feet, 6 inches long. The theatre does not have a balcony. The original molded white tin ceiling is still there, however it and the surrounding walls have experienced rain damage. The proscenium arch spans 20 feet across and 11 feet high. The stage floor is 18 feet deep from the beginning of the arch at the front of the stage to the back wall. The stage has no apron and contains no trap doors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Social =====
The '''Tecumseh Opera House''' was a nonaffiliated place where people could have political meetings, church socials, basketball, and school entertainment. Before radio and television were invented to tell people about events, they were often scheduled and anticipated months in advance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Théâtre des Capucines''' was a former theatre on the [[boulevard des Capucines]] in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris|2nd arrondissement]] of [[Paris]]. It was built in 1889 by architect [[Édouard-Jean Niermans]] and then taken over by two brothers, [[Émile Isola]] and [[Vincent Isola]], in 1892 to become the '''Théâtre Isola'''. They managed the theatre until 1897.

Berthez Armand was an early director and the actress-dancer [[Gaby Deslys]] (1881-1920) appeared there. The actress, singer and film star [[Arletty]] made her debut there in October 1919 and performed there regularly for ten years, especially in operettas. It was also the venue of the 1941 musical comedy ''Une femme par jour'', (with music by  [[Georges Van Parys]] and text by [[Pierre Véber]] and [[Jean Boyer (director)|Jean Boyer]]). [[Serge Gainsbourg]] inaugurated a series of popular concerts at the theatre in 1963, including an appearance by the singer [[Barbara (singer)|Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://francois.faurant.free.fr/a_capucines/barbara_a_capucines.html Artists at the Théâtre des Capucines in 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre finally in 1970 and was taken over by the perfume company Fragonard which has preserved the building as a perfume museum, the '''[[Théâtre-Musée des Capucines]]'''.

This is an incomplete list of alleged sightings of [[unidentified flying objects]] or UFOs in [[Argentina]].

== 12 May 1962 ==
* On 12 May 1962 three truckmen, Valentino Tomassini, Gauro Tomassini and Humberto Zenobi were travelling on Route 35 from [[Bahia Blanca]] to [[Jacinto Aráuz]]. At 4,10 they saw an object on the ground in a field next to the road at a distance of 100 metres. The object looked like a railroad car and was illuminated. As their truck came close to it, the object rose up and crossed the road at a height of four metres; its lights went out and from the lower part of it came a reddish flame. At last, the object divided into two parts, which flew off in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/Uriondo,UFOs%20Type-1,1950-1965,Argentina-1,FSR-CH%201972%20N%2012.pdf Primary catalogue of type 1 cases in Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufoinfo.com/magonia/part6.shtml The Magonia database from February 1958 to November 1962]&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes place on December 1, 1965 at 8:30 pm, at the private-owner Adhara Observatory in [[San Miguel, Buenos Aires|San Miguel]], [[Buenos Aires province]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Scientists received several calls concerning strange objects visible on the moon. The staff of the observatory photographed the moon in fixed intervals; after processing, some photos revealed disk shaped objects flying in front of the moon.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Some experts think that the UFOs on the photos are probably a fault in the processing of the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikaros.org.es/fotocat/argentina1965en.pdf Argentina, The year 1965 in photos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529070328/http://www.ikaros.org.es/fotocat/argentina1965en.pdf |date=2012-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 27 October 1973 ==
* On October 30 truck driver Dionisio Llanca was admitted to the Municipal Hospital of [[Bahía Blanca]]. He claimed that on the night of October 27, he left his uncle's home in Bahia Blanca to travel to [[Río Gallegos]] when he stopped to change a tire and became paralyzed by an intense light. According to Llanca, he saw an object in the sky and beings he described as two men and a woman who subjected him to some form of medical testing. Llanca says he briefly awoke hours later approximately 9 kilometers away.&lt;ref name="BartholomewHoward1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E. Bartholomew|author2=George S.

[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]'s flattering portrait of the [[kilt]]ed [[King George IV]], with lighting chosen to tone down the brightness of his kilt and his knees shown bare, without the pink [[tights]] he actually wore at the event.]]
The '''visit of King George IV to Scotland''' in 1822 was the first visit of a reigning [[Monarchs of Scotland|monarch]] to [[Scotland]] in nearly two centuries, the last being by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] for his Scottish coronation in 1633. Government ministers had pressed the King to bring forward a proposed visit to Scotland, to divert him from [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] intrigue at the [[Congress of Verona]].

The visit increased the king's popularity in Scotland, turning some subjects away from the rebellious [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] of the time. However, it was [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s organisation of the visit, with the inclusion of [[tartan]] pageantry, that was to have a lasting influence, by elevating the [[tartan]] [[kilt]] to become part of [[Scottish national identity|Scotland's national identity]].

==Background==
After nearly a decade of ruling as [[Prince Regent]], [[George IV of Great Britain|George IV]] acceded to the throne and his coronation on 19 July 1821, was celebrated by splendid traditional pageantry, much of it invented for the occasion. He was obese and was widely unpopular, with many offended by his treatment of [[Caroline of Brunswick|his wife]].  He had also been struggling to manipulate the government, which was seen as a corrupt [[oligarchy]] by [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]]s whose increasing unrest following the revolutions which shook [[American Revolution| America]] and [[French Revolution|France]] culminated in the "[[Radical War]]" of 1820 in Scotland and terrified the gentry. He was invited to attend a [[Congress system|Congress]] in [[Verona]], but government ministers wanting to keep [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]ary control of foreign affairs pressed him to bring forward a proposed visit to Scotland which it was hoped would calm unrest. Suffering from painful illness and pushed by opposing factions of diplomats and ministers, the King remained indecisive, but preparations went ahead in the hope of his agreement.  

Walter Scott was the author of the novel ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' which popularised a romantic image of the [[Scottish Highlands]]. In 1815 this led to his being invited to dine with George, who was then the Prince Regent.  By 1822 Scott had become a [[baronet]], and was well acquainted with both Highland and [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] [[Peerage of Scotland|nobility]].  

[[Kilts]] and [[tartan]]s were used for army uniforms but were no longer ordinary Highland wear, having been prescribed in the wake of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite Risings]] by the [[Dress Act]]. The "small" kilt as worn today was a relatively recent innovation in the Highlands, having been introduced around the 1720s and later adopted as dress uniform by the army, but the romance of the "ancient" [[belted plaid]] still appealed to those wanting to preserve the Highland identity. Soon after the Act's repeal in 1782, Highland aristocrats set up Highland Societies in [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland|Edinburgh]] and other centers including [[Highland Society of London|London]] and Aberdeen. These were landowners' clubs with aims including "Improvements" (the [[Highland Clearances]]) and promoting "the general use of the ancient Highland dress" by obliging members to wear this when attending meetings. Numerous less exclusive associations including the ''[[Celtic Society of Edinburgh]]'', of which Scott was enthusiastic chairman, had membership including many lowlanders as well as chieftains of impeccable Highland ancestry, and also promoted a Highland culture with all attending meetings and dances wearing "the garb of old Gaul".

==Preparations==
[[File:George IV in kilt, caricature.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Contemporary [[caricature]] of the kilted King George IV.]]
When his advice was sought, Sir [[Walter Scott]] seized the opportunity to invent a splendid [[ceremony|pageant]] wherein ancient Scotland would be reborn, and the king parodied in [[cartoon]]s as a fat [[:wikt:debauchery|debaucher]] would be seen as "a portly handsome man looking and moving every inch a King". George would be presented as a new [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] king, with the logic that he was by bloodline as much a [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] as [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] had been, and would win the affections of the Scots away from radical reform. A small committee was set up, with Scott's principal assistant being his friend Major General [[David Stewart (major-general)| David Stewart of Garth]] who had made himself the undisputed authority on Highlanders with his ''Sketches''.

George had been persuaded by Scott that he was not only a [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] prince, but also a Jacobite Highlander, and could rightly and properly swathe himself in "[[the Garb of Old Gaul]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[sic]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;", so in July 1822 the King placed his order with [[George Hunter &amp; Co.]], [[outfitter]]s of [[Tokenhouse Yard]], London and [[Princes Street]], [[Edinburgh]], for [[pound sterling|£]]1,354 18[[shilling|s]] (a sum equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|1354.9|1822|r=-4}}}} today{{inflation-fn|UK}}) worth of highland outfit in bright red Royal Tartan, later known as [[Royal Stuart]], complete with gold chains and assorted weaponry including [[dirk]], [[sword]] and [[pistol]]s.

Scott brought the Highland societies and the [[Scottish clan|Clan chieftains]] into arranging for a [[Full plaid|plaid]]ed pageantry. Garth now drilled the younger members of the ''Celtic Society'' into four companies as honour guards. Their mix of lowlanders and highlanders had already offended [[Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry]], who was quick to demand that his ''Society of True Highlanders'' be given precedence, but his attempts to take over were generally disregarded. Some chieftains took the event as a chance to show impressive forces and thus disprove allegations about the Highland Clearances, but the decimation of their tenantry rather undermined this. [[James Loch]] acting for the [[Countess of Sutherland]] solved the problem of finding kilts by borrowing army uniforms from the [[Sutherland Highlanders]]. 

For the management of all events, Scott took the advice of his friend the young actor-manager [[William Henry Murray]] whose talents at theatrical scenery and costume were put to good use in creating the settings and the "revived ancient dresses" for the pageants he arranged. [[Holyrood Palace]] had to be readied for state occasions, but was not in fit condition as a royal residence and arrangements were made for the king to stay at [[Dalkeith Palace|Dalkeith House]], 7&amp;nbsp;miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Edinburgh]].

There was widespread concern about procedure and [[etiquette]], not least amongst the touchy Highland chiefs (notably Glengarry), which Scott met by producing a shilling booklet  "HINTS addressed to the INHABITANTS OF EDINBURGH AND OTHERS in prospect of HIS MAJESTY'S VISIT. By an old citizen",&lt;ref&gt;[http://spinnet.eu/images/2010-12/scotthints_new.pdf SPIN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308000340/http://spinnet.eu/images/2010-12/scotthints_new.pdf |date=8 March 2016 }} [Walter Scott]: "Hints Adressed to the Inhabitants of Edinburgh, and others, in Prospect of His Majesty’s visit. By an Old Citizen."  Source: Printed pamphlet, Edinburgh: William Blackwood, Waugh and Innes, and John Robertson, 1822&lt;/ref&gt;  which gave an outline of planned events with detailed advice on behaviour and clothing. All [[gentleman|gentlemen]] of the city were expected to attend public appearances in a uniform blue coat, white waistcoat and white or [[nankeen]] (yellowish) cotton trousers, and a low-crowned dark hat decorated with a [[cockade]] in the form a white [[St. Andrew]]'s [[Flag of Scotland|saltire]] on a blue background. Similarly detailed guidance was given for those fortunate enough to attend functions or [[Levee (event)|levees]], with gentlemen to wear a full dress suit, as well as a description of the dress of the Highland chiefs and their "tail" of followers who were expected to "add greatly to the variety, gracefulness and appropriate splendour of the scene".

The exception was the "Grand Ball" held by the [[peers of Scotland]] to entertain the king:  Scott's "Hints" called this a "Highland Ball", reminded readers that the king had ordered a kilt and set the condition that, unless in uniform, "no Gentleman is to be allowed to appear in any thing but the ancient Highland costume".  At this, lowland gentlemen suddenly embarked on a desperate search for Highland ancestry (however remote) and a suitable [[tartan]] [[kilt]] from the Edinburgh tailors, who responded inventively. This can be seen as the pivotal event when what had been thought of as the primitive dress of mountain thieves became the [[national dress]] of the whole of Scotland.

The catering contract was won by Ebenezer Scroggie, who would become the posthumous inspiration for [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens']] character [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=1462612004 "When A Christmas Carol , one of Dickens’ finest works, was published in 1843, it featured Ebenezer Scrooge, a "mean man" erroneously based on Ebenezer Scroggie." "He won the catering contract for the visit of George IV to Edinburgh in 1822... "], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 24 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==The visit==

The first of Scott's pageants took place on the King's 60th birthday, on Monday 12 August 1822. In procession the Midlothian Yeomanry and companies of Highlanders escorted coaches carrying the Regalia of Scotland and dignitaries from the Castle to Holyrood Palace. The procession assembled on [[The Mound]] before going up to the Castle, and within minutes of setting off was halted by the arrival on horseback of a flamboyantly dressed [[Alasdair Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry|Glengarry]] who announced that it was his rightful place to ride at the head of the procession. After a pause, a Captain Ewan MacDougall persuaded the hot-tempered Glengarry to go away. Watched by packed crowds, the procession formally received the regalia then returned down to The Mound and went down it to Princes Street and on by Calton Hill to Holyroodhouse. 

The King's ship the [[HMS Royal George|''Royal George'']] arrived in the [[Firth of Forth]] about noon on Wednesday 14 August, but his landing was postponed due to torrential rain. Despite the rain Sir Walter Scott was rowed out to see the King, on arrival and announced the King exclaimed " What! Sir Walter Scott the man in Scotland I most wish to see&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NzE6AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Memoirs+of+the+Life+of+Sir+Walter+Scott,+Volume+3&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJoa_9rvHcAhUDDsAKHUoIBxoQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Memoirs%20of%20the%20Life%20of%20Sir%20Walter%20Scott%2C%20Volume%203&amp;f=false Memoirs Of Sir Walter Scott. Lockhart Vol 3 p.117]&lt;/ref&gt;! After a drink of whisky Scott presented to the King a jewel designed and embroidered by the ladies of Edinburgh, in the form of a silver St Andrews cross embroidered with pearls on blue velvet with a belt of gold a diamond buckle and magnificent Scottish pearl surmounted by the imperial crown picked out in brilliants, rubies, emeralds and topaz&lt;ref&gt;George IV by E A Smith 1999 p200.&lt;/ref&gt;. Inscribed on the cross is; "Righ Albainn gu brath" translated as Long life for the King&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bDs6AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA480&amp;lpg=PA480&amp;dq=righ+albainn+gu+brath&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yLCyEyvSIL&amp;sig=aXesE3H3bxlmjdPszhQz7mgJrvU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjliPjP44fdAhXQRMAKHWx9AfQQ6AEwHHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Memoirs of Sir Walter Scott Lockhart. vol 1. p 480]&lt;/ref&gt;.

On Thursday 15 August, the King in naval uniform arrived in sunshine at the quayside of The Shore, [[Leith]] and stepped ashore onto a red carpet strewn with flowers to greet the waiting crowds. After fifteen minutes of the ritual salutations traditional in a [[royal entry]] he got in his carriage. A quiet pause was rudely interrupted by [[Alasdair Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry|Glengarry]] on horseback galloping up beside the King, sweeping off his bonnet and loudly announcing "Your Majesty is welcome to Scotland!". The King, in good humour, bowed graciously at this unplanned intrusion as his carriage moved off.  A procession including lowland regiments and Highland clan regiments with [[pipe band]]s escorted the King's open carriage the 3&amp;nbsp;miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) up to Edinburgh past cheering Scots crowding every possible viewpoint eager to show a welcome to their monarch. At a theatrical "medieval" gateway the King was presented with the keys to the city and "the hearts and persons" of its people.

Much of the pageantry for the visit would be medieval rather than Highland, but the exotic outfits of the "gathering of the Gael" were to attract most attention. The next day was one that the King spent away from the public at Dalkeith. Edinburgh was full of visitors for the occasion, and that evening they walked round enjoying "illuminations" with illustrated tributes hung on public buildings, businesses and houses, "Everywhere crowded to excess, but in civility and quiet", before being escorted to their rest around midnight by bands of boys carrying flaming torches to light their way. 

On Saturday afternoon, 17 August, the King attended a short [[levee (event)|levee]] at Holyrood Palace, where the great and good queued to be greeted by George in his Highland outfit complete with pink [[trousers|pantaloons]] to conceal his bloated legs, described as "buff coloured trowsers like ''flesh'' to ''imitate'' his ''Royal knees''". When someone complained that the kilt had been too short for modesty, Lady Hamilton-Dalrymple wittily responded "Since he is to be among us for so short a time, the more we see of him the better."  

The King would not be seen again by the public until Monday afternoon when a medium-sized crowd caught a brief glimpse of him as he went into Holyroodhouse to hear long repetitive addresses from the [[Church of Scotland]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], universities, burghs, counties and ''the Highland Society'', and give his short formal responses. 

The ''King's Drawing Room'' on Tuesday 20 August was attended by 457 ladies, and custom required that he kiss each one on the cheek. This brief occasion took him away from Dalkeith House for two hours, and the presentation of the ladies lasted from 2.15 to 3.30. In the rush some ladies received no "buss" on the cheek, or in their nervousness scarcely felt the kiss at all. All were dressed in rich gowns with sweeping trains, and most had coloured ostrich plumes above their elaborately curled hair. The King was courteous and smiling, and paid particular attention to "the lady on whose account so many Highlanders went down to [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] two years ago" when election passions led to Lady Anne Margaret Grant, daughter of the late [[Sir James Grant, 8th Baronet]], and her sisters who had also supported the [[Tory|Tories]], being besieged by a "democratic mob" of [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] supporting townsfolk until a rescue party of her clansmen was "summoned by the fiery cross" and released them without coming to blows. The story of "The Raid to Elgin" had amused the king, and he remarked "Truly she is an object fit to raise the chivalry of a clan", echoing Scott's romanticism. He spent the next day at Dalkeith, and that evening Scott dined with him.

[[File:KGIV and hat.jpg|thumb|left|The King waves his hat from the castle battlements.]]
Heavy rain returned on Thursday 22 August as a ''Grand Procession'' went from [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]] to [[Edinburgh Castle]]. The procession and the King's closed carriage went up a [[Royal Mile]] flanked by colourful [[bunting (textile)|bunting]] and densely packed cheering crowds obscured by their umbrellas. At the castle, the king climbed out onto the [[battlement]]s of the Half Moon Battery to wave his cocked hat to continuing "huzzas" from the crowd for fifteen minutes, reportedly saying "Good God! What a fine sight. I had no conception there was such a fine scene in the world; and to find it in my own dominions; and the people are as beautiful and as extraordinary as the scene." and "Rain? I feel no rain. Never mind, I must cheer the people."  He had not been used to this kind of reception.

On Friday, 23 August, a review of 3,000 volunteer [[cavalry]]men was held on [[Portobello, Scotland|Portobello sands]]. The king was also to honour the Clans including a contingent from the Celtic Society of Edinburgh. Though disappointingly his review ended before reaching them, the Highlanders took part in the ''Grand March Past'' then were cheered by the crowds as they marched back to Edinburgh. That evening, George appeared at the Peers' ''Grand Ball'' wearing a [[field marshal]]'s uniform as earlier in the day rather than the anticipated kilt, and sat to enjoy watching the [[Scottish country dancing]] and the splendour of the [[belted plaid]]s worn by the men. He left before midnight, but the Ball continued with increasing spirit until past one in the morning. The Assembly Rooms had been theatrically transformed by [[William Henry Murray]], and the occasion was hailed as a triumph for him. 

Saturday morning was marked by a small ceremony and procession including a [[Clan MacGregor]] Regalia Guard, as the Honours of Scotland were returned from Holyroodhouse up the Royal Mile to the Castle. That evening the King attended a tumultuous civic banquet in the great Hall of [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] which Murray had splendidly decorated.

Next day the King went in state to the [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] Sunday service at [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]. On the Monday he made a private visit to the [[Holyrood Palace]] apartments of his ancestor [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], then in the evening attended the ''[[Caledonia]]n Hunt Ball'' in a Guards uniform. Again many of the dancers were kilted, and the King was excited by the [[reel (dance)|reel]]s and [[strathspey (dance)|strathspey]]s. Once more his wish was met, that while he was in Scotland all music would be "purely national and characteristic". On the Tuesday, 27 August, George made his last and least formal public appearance, showing his evident pleasure at a theatre performance of Scott's ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]'' adapted and produced by [[William Henry Murray]]. 

George's visit closed on Thursday 29 August with a brief visit to [[Hopetoun House]] 12 miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) west of Edinburgh. Elaborate arrangements had been made and crowds waited for him in the rain. On departing Hopetoun House The King conferred the honour of Knighthood&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NzE6AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Memoirs+of+the+Life+of+Sir+Walter+Scott,+Volume+3&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJoa_9rvHcAhUDDsAKHUoIBxoQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=130&amp;f=false Memoirs of the life of Sir Walter Scott Vol 3 page 130]&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Adam_Ferguson_(British_Army_officer)|Capt Adam Ferguson]] Deputy keeper of the [[Honours of Scotland|Scottish regalia]] and [[Henry_Raeburn|Henry Raeburn]] the selected representative of Scotlands fine arts. He then joined his ship at nearby [[South Queensferry]] and departed.

==Outcome==
While the King's one-kilted appearance was to be ruthlessly [[caricature]]d, creating a memorable image of "our fat friend" being hoisted onto a horse, the effect of the event wryly described as "one and twenty daft days" was an increase in goodwill and a new-found [[Scottish national identity]] uniting Highlander and Lowlander in sharing the iconic symbolism of kilts and tartans. The pride of the Clan chieftains in their heritage was reinvigorated, but there was no check in the progress of the [[Highland Clearances]].

Additionally, the next [[Duke of Rothesay]], [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert Edward]], was the first heir apparent to make use of that title since the [[Union of the Crowns]]. The use of that title in Scotland has continued ever since.

Following their service providing personal bodyguards during the visit, the King appointed the [[Royal Company of Archers]] as the [[Sovereign's Bodyguard]] in Scotland.

The '''Vizcaíno-Serra Oak''' (also known as the '''Junipero Oak''') was a large [[Quercus agrifolia|California live oak]] tree closely associated with [[Junípero Serra]] and the early history of [[Monterey, California]]. First described in 1602 by the explorer [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]], it stood next to a creek in what is now [[Monterey State Historic Park]]. The tree was declared dead in 1904 and cut down in 1905. The preserved trunk and lower branches were erected in the grounds of the [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo (Monterey, California)|Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]] where they remained for most of the 20th century. Although the remains of the tree have since been removed, pieces of it are on display in local museums.

==History==
The tree once stood in a ravine whose creek flowed into the southern end of Monterey Bay. It was there that the [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] expedition drew fresh water after entering the bay on December 3, 1602. On December 17, 1602 the Carmelite friars of the Vizcaíno expedition held a mass under the tree and Vizcaíno claimed Monterey for Spain. Vizcaíno also noted the tree in his descriptions of the bay for future expeditions. In 1769 [[Gaspar de Portolà]] led an expedition to find the bay and establish Monterey as a Spanish settlement. After initially failing to find it, he was successful in May 1770  after following [[Junipero Serra]]'s suggestion to look for the large oak tree described by Vizcaino. On June 3, 1770 bells were hung from the tree. Father Serra said a Mass in an arbor constructed under the tree and the military officers of the Portolà expedition unfurled the Spanish flag.&lt;ref name = "COM"&gt;City of Monterey (2017).[http://www.monterey.org/museums/Monterey-Art/The-Vizcaino-Serra-Oak "The Vizcaino-Serra Oak: The Tree Where Monterey Began"].

Although damaged by lightning in 1840, the tree continued to stand as a landmark until 1905. In 1903 workmen repairing a culvert near the tree had caused what later proved to be irreversible sea-water damage to its roots. [[William Randolph Hearst]] bought the plot of land on which the tree stood with the intention of asking Congress to cede further land to construct a memorial park around the tree and preserve it from future intrusions. However, in July 1904 the tree was declared dead, and a year later it was cut down and thrown into Monterey Bay.&lt;ref&gt;''Monterey New Era'' (6 July 1904).

When Ramón Mestres, the pastor of the [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo (Monterey, California)|Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]], discovered what had happened, he had the tree hauled out of the bay by local fishermen and brought to the grounds of the cathedral. With financial help from [[Harry Ashland Greene]], the trunk and with some of its lower branches was preserved with crude oil and creosote and the parts which had been eaten away were filled with concrete.&lt;ref&gt; Morgado, Martin J. (1987). ''Junípero Serra's Legacy'', pp. 123–124. Mount Carmel. {{ISBN|0961833920}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the tree were then erected on a pedestal in the gardens at the rear of the cathedral. A commemorative plaque was placed at its foot. The dedication reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Junipero Oak. At Monterey, June 3rd, 1770 the ceremony of taking possession of California for Spain was enacted by Father Junipero Serra under the shade of this tree, placed here for preservation by R.M. Mestres, H.A. Greene, 1905&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Greene also commissioned local craftsmen to make chairs out of some of its branches, two of which he donated to the [[Native Sons of the Golden West]]. One of the chairs, owned by California State Parks, was exhibited at the [[Panama Pacific International Exposition]] and was on display at the [[Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History]] in 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref name = "Rothal"&gt;Rothal, Jeff (12 June 2015).

In 1908, a granite [[Celtic cross]] with a bas-relief portrait of Junípero Serra sculpted by [[Douglas Tilden]] was erected near the original site of the tree by the art collector James A. Murray and is now a [[California Historical Landmarks|California Historical Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;Andresen, Anna Geil (1917).

Retrieved 22 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray, who had made his fortune in the Montana mining industry, settled in Monterey in 1904. He took a keen interest in Monterey's history and owned one of the three paintings by [[Léon Trousset]] depicting Junipero Serra's first Mass beneath the oak tree. Murray's wife commissioned "The Passing of an Oak", a poem by Mary Sullivan Spence commemorating the tree. It was published in a limited edition in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Mary Sullivan (1909).

The preserved tree eventually decayed beyond repair and was removed from the cathedral grounds, leaving only the plaque which had been placed beneath it in 1905. However pieces of the tree are on display at the San Carlos Cathedral Heritage Center and at the [[Carmel Mission]] museum.&lt;ref name = "Rothal" /&gt;
[[File:Father Serra Celebrates Mass at Monterey by Léon Trousset.jpg|thumb|''Father Serra Celebrates Mass at Monterey'' by Léon Trousset, 1877]]

==In art==
In 2015 a mural, commissioned by the city of Monterey and depicting what the tree might have looked like to Sebastián Vizcaíno in 1602, was erected along the Monterey Bay Coastal Recreation Trail. The 12-foot by 5-foot work is attached to a wall opposite [[Fisherman's Wharf, Monterey, California|Fisherman's Wharf]]. Its artist, scientific illustrator Stephanie Rozzo, based the painting on late 19th-century photographs of the tree and an 1876 drawing by [[Jules Tavernier (painter)|Jules Tavernier]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monterey Herald]]'' (17 July 2015).

Two other European artists who frequented Tavernier's art colony also painted the Vizcaíno-Serra Oak—[[Carl von Perbandt]] and [[Léon Trousset]]. In the 1870s Trousset created three romanticized depictions (two in oil and one in watercolor) of Junipero Serra celebrating Mass beneath the tree on June 3, 1770. Trousset's large-scale 1877 version, ''Father Serra Celebrates Mass at Monterey'', is on display in the Carmel Mission museum. Another version is held by the [[California Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, John (2003).

'''''Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down'''''  is a [[1970 in television|1970]] [[animation|animated]] showcase for various caricatured [[Jerry Lewis]] characters, all based on characters from the Lewis film, ''[[The Family Jewels (film)|The Family Jewels]]'' and styled in a fashion similar to ''[[The Archie Show|Archie's TV Funnies]]'' and the ''[[Groovie Goolies]]''. The title is a variant of the deciding question on the game show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'': "Will the real __________ please stand up?". Like most 1970s-era [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series, ''Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down'' contained an adult [[laugh track]].

==Premise==
As with all of their wilder comedies, such as those mentioned above and later shows like ''[[Uncle Croc's Block]]'' and ''[[The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty]]'', [[Filmation]] stuffed the episodes with [[slapstick]] jokes, and the rubbery, gangly animated version of Lewis was well realised and similar to his depiction in [[DC Comics]]' long running comic book title, ''[[The Adventures of Jerry Lewis]]'' (originally published as ''[[The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis]]'' prior to the dissolution of their show business partnership). Among the recurring characters were Chinese detective Hong Kong Flewis and his rotund son, One Ton Son; his father, Professor Lewis; and his sister Geraldine (and her pet frog, Spot).

In the series, Jerry worked for the Odd Job Employment Agency under the supervision of the obnoxious Mr. Blunderbuss. A typical episode found Jerry being assigned a job, and making a complete shambles of it in his harmless, naive way.

Though Jerry Lewis contributed to some of the scripts, he did not voice any of the characters. The central character of Jerry Lewis was voiced by [[David Lander]], who would later be better-known for his role of [[Squiggy]] on ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]''.

Notably wild in their style were the opening credits and commercial bumpers. The theme song was sang in a contemporary "bubblegum" style, with the song interrupted before the end of its final verse with the title of the show intoned in a scolding manner by an announcer (Howard Morris) who stretched out the word "please" and shouted "sit down". ''Will The Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down'' contained several ethnic (notably Asian) stereotypes.

Along with ''[[Groovie Goolies]]'', this was one of the first Filmation series to feature the rotating Lou Scheimer/Norm Prescott "wheel" credit. Previous shows featured a standard credit with Scheimer's name above Prescott's. It was also Filmation's first show to feature director Hal Sutherland's name written in fancy lettering.

==Cast==
* [[David Lander]] – Jerry Lewis
* [[Howard Morris]] – Mr. Blunderbuss
