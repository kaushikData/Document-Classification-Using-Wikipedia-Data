[[File:A history of the world in 100 objects book cover.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''A History of the World in 100 Objects'', the companion book by Neil MacGregor]]
'''''A History of the World in 100 Objects''''' was a joint project of [[BBC Radio 4]] and the [[British Museum]], comprising a 100-part radio series written and presented by British Museum director [[Neil MacGregor]]. In 15-minute presentations broadcast on weekdays on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], MacGregor used objects of ancient art, industry, technology and arms, all of which are in the British Museum's collections, as an introduction to parts of human history.
The series, four years in planning, began on 18 January 2010 and was broadcast over 20 weeks.&lt;ref name=grouplead&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article6718556.ece |publisher=Times Online |title=British Museum and BBC reveal history of world in 100 objects |date=18 July 2009 |author=Ben Hoyle }}

The British Museum won the 2011 [[Art Fund Prize]] for its role in hosting the project.

In 2016, a touring exhibition of several items depicted on the radio program, also titled ''A History of the World in 100 Objects'', travelled to various destinations, including [[Abu Dhabi]] (Manarat Al Saadiyat), Taiwan ([[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei), Japan ([[Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum]] in Tokyo, [[Kyushu National Museum]] in Daizafu, and [[Kobe City Museum]] in Kobe), Australia ([[Western Australian Museum]] in [[Perth]] and [[National Museum of Australia]] in [[Canberra]]), and China ([[National Museum of China]] in Beijing and [[Shanghai Museum]] in Shanghai).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-life/new-exhibition-opening-at-the-national-museum-of-australia-in-canberra-tells-the-history-of-two-million-years-in-100-objects-20160823-gqz91p.html |newspaper=The Canberra Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |title=New exhibition opening at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra tells the history of two million years in 100 objects |first=Sally |last=Pryor |date=26 August 2016 |accessdate=18 January 2017 |archivedate=18 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113902/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-life/new-exhibition-opening-at-the-national-museum-of-australia-in-canberra-tells-the-history-of-two-million-years-in-100-objects-20160823-gqz91p.html |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-08/two-million-years-of-human-history-national-museum-canberra/7826960 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 September 2016 |first=Tom |last=Lowrey |title=A History of the World in 100 Objects explored in National Museum of Australia exhibition |deadurl=no |accessdate=18 January 2017 |archivedate=18 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218203354/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-08/two-million-years-of-human-history-national-museum-canberra/7826960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shanghaidaily.com/metro/society/Big-queues-for-fascinating-world-story-told-through-100-objects/shdaily.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Shiva and Parvati sculpture display.jpg|alt=Object 68|thumb|Object  68, the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity couple [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] sculpture with radio series information panel.]]
The programme series, described as "a landmark project",&lt;ref name=DTR&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7020901/A-History-of-the-World-in-100-Objects-Radio-4-review.html |title=A History of the World in 100 Objects, Radio 4, review |author=Gillian Reynolds|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=18 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; is billed as 'A history of humanity' told through a hundred objects from all over the world in the British Museum's collection.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In these programmes, I'm travelling back in time, and across the globe, to see how we humans over 2 million years have shaped our world and been shaped by it, and I'm going to tell this story exclusively through the things that humans have made: all sorts of things, carefully designed, and then either admired and preserved, or used, broken and thrown away. I've chosen just a hundred objects from different points on our journey, from a cooking pot to a golden galleon, from a Stone Age tool to a credit card.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Neil MacGregor, Programme 1, broadcast 18 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Telling history through things, whether it's an Egyptian mummy or a credit card, is what museums are for, and because the British Museum has collected things from all over the globe, it's not a bad place to try to tell a world history. Of course, it can only be "a" history of the world, not "the" history.  When people come to the museum they choose their own objects and make their own journey round the world and through time, but I think what they will find is that their own histories quickly intersect with everybody else's, and when that happens, you no longer have a history of a particular people or nation, but a story of endless connections.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accompanying the series is a website, described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "even more ambitious [than the radio series itself] that encourages users to submit items of their own for a place in world history", along with much interactive content, detailed information on all the objects featured in the radio programmes and links to 350 other museum collections across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jan/18/100-objects-bbc-online-history | publisher=The Guardian | location=London | title=Beyond 100 objects: exploring the BBC's online history of the world | date=19 January 2010 | accessdate=23 April 2010 | first=Mercedes | last=Bunz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The radio programmes are available on the website permanently for listening or downloading.

The museum has adapted exhibitions for the series by including additional easily identifiable plaques for the 100 objects with text based on the programme and adding a section to the gallery maps showing the location and numbers of the 100 objects.

On 18 January 2010, an hour-long special of ''[[The Culture Show]]'' on [[BBC2]] was dedicated to the launch of the project.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00q9xsc |publisher=BBC The Culture Show|date=18 January 2010 |author= |title= History of the World: Culture Show Special}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the series was broadcast on weekdays over six weeks between 18 January and 26 February 2010. After a short break, the series returned with the seventh week being broadcast in the week beginning 17 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elisabeth Mahoney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/may/18/history-of-the-world-100-objects |title=A History of the World in 100 Objects |publisher=The Guardian |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2010-06-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then took another break in the middle of July and returned on 13 September 2010, running until the 100th object was featured on Friday 22 October 2010.

==Reception==
[[Maev Kennedy]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the programme as "a broadcasting phenomenon", while Tim Davie, head of music and audio at BBC radio, commented that "the results have been nothing short of stunning", exceeding the BBC's wildest hopes for the programme. At the time of the writing of Kennedy's article, just before the start of the last week  of the series, the radio broadcasts regularly had up to four million listeners, while the podcast downloads had totalled 10,441,884. Of these, just over half, 5.7 million, were from the UK.  In addition, members of the public had uploaded 3,240 objects with the largest single contribution coming from Glasgow historian Robert Pool who submitted 120 objects all relating to the City of Glasgow, and other museums a further 1,610, and 531 museums and heritage sites across the UK had been mounting linked events – an unprecedented partnership, MacGregor said. Museums all over the world are now copying the formula, as thousands of visitors every day set out to explore the British Museum galleries equipped with the leaflet mapping the objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/14/radio-4-history-world-objects|publisher=The Guardian |date=14 October 2010 |author=Maev Kennedy |title=Radio 4's A History of the World in 100 Objects draws to a close}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', [[Philip Hensher]] described the series as "perfect radio", saying "Has there ever been a more exciting, more unfailingly interesting radio series than the Radio 4/British Museum venture, A History of the World in 100 Objects? It is such a beautifully simple idea, to trace human civilisations through the objects that happen to have survived. Each programme, just 15 minutes long, focuses on just one thing, quite patiently, without dawdling. At the end, you feel that you have learnt something, and learnt it with pleasure and interest.  For years to come, the BBC will be able to point to this wonderful series as an example of the things that it does best. It fulfils, to a degree that one thought hardly possible any more, the BBC's [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith#Reithianism|Reithian]] agenda of improvement and the propagation of learning and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/philip-hensher/philip-hensher-the-objects-of-my-affection-2106649.html|publisher=The Independent |date=15 October 2010 |author=Philip Hensher |title=Philip Hensher: The objects of my affection
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dominic Sandbrook]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' said that the "joyously highbrow" series "deserves to take its place alongside television classics such as [[Kenneth Clark]]'s ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' and [[Jacob Bronowski]]'s ''[[The Ascent of Man]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8057212/An-object-lesson-in-history-from-Radio-Four.html|publisher=The Telegraph |date=11 October 2010 |author=Dominic Sandbrook|title=An object lesson in history from Radio Four}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special edition ==
A special radio programme on Radio 4, first broadcast on 18 May 2011, featured one of the many thousands of items nominated on the BBC website by members of the public as an object of special significance.&lt;ref name="telegraph-2011-05-12"&gt;{{cite news | author=Gillian Reynolds | title=A History of the World Special, Radio 4, preview | publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]] | date=12 May 2011 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8509588/A-History-of-the-World-Special-Radio-4-preview.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object chosen to be featured on the programme was an oil painting depicting a young woman that was nominated by Peter Lewis.  The painting, which belonged to Lewis' uncle, Bryn Roberts, was painted from a postcard photograph of Roberts' girlfriend (and later wife), Peggy Gullup, by an anonymous Jewish artist for Roberts whilst he was a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in Poland.&lt;ref name="special"&gt;{{cite web | title=A History of the World Special | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b010y36c/A_History_of_the_World_Special/ | publisher=BBC Radio 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thejc"&gt;{{cite news | author=Jessica Elgot | title=He put colour in her cheeks: did her smile save his life? | publisher=[[Jewish Chronicle]] | date=19 May 2011 | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/49167/he-put-colour-her-cheeks-did-her-smile-save-his-life }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art Fund Prize ==
The British Museum won the 2011 [[Art Fund Prize]] for museums and galleries for its part in the ''A History of the World in 100 Objects'' series.  The prize, worth £100,000, was presented to the museum by [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]], Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, in a ceremony at London on 15 June 2011.&lt;ref name="guardian-2011-06-15"&gt;{{cite news | author=Mark Brown | title=British Museum wins Arts Fund prize | publisher=The Guardian | date=15 June 2011 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jun/15/british-museum-wins-arts-fund-prize }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chairman of the panel of judges, [[Michael Portillo]], noted that the judges were "particularly impressed by the truly global scope of the British Museum’s project, which combined intellectual rigour and open heartedness, and went far beyond the boundaries of the museum’s walls".&lt;ref name="artfund"&gt;{{cite web | title=British Museum scoops £100,000 Art Fund Prize and is crowned 'Museum of the Year' | publisher=[[The Art Fund]] | url=http://www.artfundprize.org.uk/art-fund-prize-winner-announced.php | access-date=15 June 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619203824/http://www.artfundprize.org.uk/art-fund-prize-winner-announced.php | archive-date=19 June 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges were also very impressed by the way that the project used digital media in ground-breaking and novel ways to interact with audiences.&lt;ref name="artfund"/&gt;

==Touring exhibition==
During 2016 and 2017 a touring exhibition of many of the one hundred objects, also titled ''History of the World in 100 Objects'', was held in a number of countries and territories, including Australia, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Taiwan, and China (first at the [[National Museum of China]] in Beijing, and then at [[Shanghai Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=International exhibitions: A History of the World in 100 Objects | url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/tours_and_loans/international_exhibitions/history_of_the_world.aspx | publisher=British Museum | accessdate=29 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="china-daily-2018"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Zhao | first=Xu | title=Global treasures on the Chinese stage | url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201801/27/WS5a6be5cea3106e7dcc1371d0_1.html | publisher=[[China Daily]] | date=27 January 2018 | accessdate=29 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the conditions encountered while touring different countries some exhibits had to be returned to the British Museum for maintenance during tour, and were replaced by other objects from the British Museum collections. Some controversial exhibits were excluded from the exhibition in some countries. Object 90 (Jade bi with poem) was not included in the exhibition held in China because it may have been looted from the [[Old Summer Palace]] in Beijing. In addition, a piece of Chinese brocade that had been included in the touring exhibition elsewhere was not included in the exhibition in China because it was collected from the [[Mogao Caves]] by [[Aurel Stein]] under controversial circumstances.&lt;ref name="china-daily-2018"/&gt;

Rents and retail sales increased, including the selling of bottled water and the opening of a pizza parlor to cater to the demand from western aid workers. The number of gas stations has tripled in three years as a result of the increase in the amount of automobiles in the city. Employment opportunities also increased as the United Nations offered jobs to citizens.

===Writings===
====Looking Back column====
Ocampo began writing for ''Weekend Magazine'', the Sunday supplement of the [[Philippine Daily Express]] in 1985 and subsequently joined its editorial staff as Associate Editor. His column ''Looking Back'' first appeared in the ''[[Philippine Daily Globe]]'' from 1987 to 1990 and compilations of these columns saw new life as his two bestselling books, namely, the ''Looking Back'' series and ''[[Rizal Without the Overcoat]]'' that was awarded the [[Philippine National Book Awards|National Book Award]] for essay in 1990. At the invitation of [[Letty Jimenez Magsanoc]] and Eugenia D. Apostol, Ocampo's ''Daily Globe'' column moved to the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' in 1990, where it appears twice weekly in the opinion editorial page.&lt;ref name="Overcoat"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |author-link=Ambeth Ocampo |title=[[Rizal Without the Overcoat]]|place=Pasig City |publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc. |year=1999 |edition = Expanded |isbn = 971-27-0920-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986, Ocampo has published over 39 books, as well as other publications, compilations of his essays and writings on Philippine history, arts and culture. Most of his published works focus on the life and works of the Philippine nationalist and martyr, [[Jose Rizal]] with ''[[Rizal Without the Overcoat]]'' going into six editions since its first publication in 1990. He has published monographs on other historical and cultural figures: the writer-artist [[Emilio Aguilar Cruz]], musical composer [[Nicanor Abelardo]], historian [[Teodoro Agoncillo]] and [[Teodora Alonso]], the mother of Rizal, among others. 

Ocampo also writes on the foreign relations of the Philippines with [[France–Philippines relations|France]] and [[Japan–Philippines relations|Japan]].&lt;ref name="published"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |author-link=Ambeth Ocampo |title=Quezon's Sukiyaki: Looking Back 12|place=Mandaluyong City |publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc. |year=2016 |edition = 1st |isbn = 978-621-420-072-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he was at work on an edition of the diaries of former Philippine President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and a biography of former Philippine President [[Fidel Ramos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

When Ocampo was appointed chair of the National Historical Institute and later elected chair of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, then President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] declared that she was an ardent reader of his newspaper column, commending his writings because he "makes history so approachable." Some academics have critiqued Ocampo for his [[populist]] approach towards historiography.  In response, Ocampo has since released two compilations of his public lectures ''Meaning and History'' focused on [[Jose Rizal]] and ''Bones of Contention'' on [[Andres Bonifacio]] both published in 2001 with the required bibliographic references and footnotes. Nevertheless, Ocampo is considered as one of the most prominent Philippine historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

During his term at the National Library he recovered the unpublished manuscripts of Rizal's unfinished novel ''[[Makamisa]]'' in 1987 and later worked on the bibliographic catalog of papers, writings and documents related to Rizal held in the vault of the National Library.&lt;ref name="National Library"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth R. |author-link=Ambeth Ocampo |title=Makamisa: The Search for Rizal's Third Novel|place=Pasig City |publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc. |year=1992 |edition = First |isbn = 9712702766}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizaliana"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth R. |author-link=Ambeth Ocampo |title=A Calendar of Rizaliana in the Vault of the Philippine National Library|place=Pasig City |publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc. |year=1993 |edition = First |isbn = 9712702944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator''' (c. 485 – c. 585),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Donnell|first1=James J.|title=Chronology|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chronology.html|website=Cassiodorus|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as '''Cassiodorus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|s|i|oʊ|ˈ|d|ɔːr|ə|s}}), was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] statesman, renowned scholar of antiquity, and writer serving in the administration of [[Theoderic the Great]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]]. ''Senator'' was part of his surname, not his rank. He also founded a monastery, Vivarium, where he spent the last years of his life.

== Life ==
Cassiodorus was born at [[Scylletium]], near [[Catanzaro]] in [[Calabria]], [[Italy]]. His ancestry included some of the most prominent ministers of the state extending back several generations.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=103}} His great-grandfather held a command in the defense of the coasts of southern Italy from [[Vandal]] sea-raiders in the middle of the fifth century; his grandfather appears in a Roman embassy to [[Attila the Hun]], and his father served as ''Count of the sacred largesses'' and ''count of the private estates'' to [[Odovacer]]{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=103}} before transferring his allegiance to [[Theoderic the Great|Theoderic]]. Under the latter, Cassiodorus' father (who  bore the same name), rose to an even higher position, achieving the office of Praetorian Prefect, which held, under the Gothic kings, the same influence that it had previously in the court of Rome.

Cassiodorus began his career under the auspices of his father, about in his twentieth year, when the latter made him his ''consiliarius'' upon his own appointment to the Praetorian Prefecture. In the judicial capacity of the prefect, he held absolute right of appeal over any magistrate in the empire (or Gothic kingdom, later) and the ''consiliarius'' served as a sort of legal advisor in cases of greater complexity. Evidently, therefore, Cassiodorus had received some education in the law.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hodgkin, ''Letters Of Cassiodorus'', (Oxford, 1886), ''introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; During his working life he worked as ''[[quaestor sacri palatii]]'' c. 507–511, as a [[Roman consul|consul]] in 514, then as ''[[magister officiorum]]'' under Theoderic, and later under the regency for Theoderic's young successor, [[Athalaric]]. Cassiodorus kept copious records and letterbooks concerning public affairs. At the Gothic court his literary skill, which seems mannered and rhetorical to modern readers, was so esteemed that when in [[Ravenna]] he was often entrusted with drafting significant public documents. His culminating appointment was as [[praetorian prefect]] for Italy, effectively the prime ministership of the Ostrogothic civil government&lt;ref&gt;Cf., e.g., F. Denis de Sainte-Marthe: ''La vie de Cassiodore, chancelier et premier ministre de Theoderic le Grand''. Paris 1694 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=tccWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP7 online, in French])&lt;/ref&gt; and a high honor to finish any career. Cassiodorus also collaborated with [[Pope Agapetus I]] in establishing a library of Greek and [[Latin]] texts which were intended to support a [[Christianity|Christian]] school in [[Rome]].

James O'Donnell notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is almost indisputable that he accepted advancement in 523 as the immediate successor of [[Boethius]], who was then falling from grace after less than a year as ''magister officiorum'', and who was sent to prison and later executed. In addition, Boethius' father-in-law (and step-father) Symmachus, by this time a distinguished elder statesman, followed Boethius to the block within a year. All this was a result of the worsening split between the ancient senatorial aristocracy centered in Rome and the adherents of Gothic rule at Ravenna. But to read Cassiodorus' Variae one would never suspect such goings-on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap1.html|title=Cassiodorus:  Chapter 1, Backgrounds and Some Dates|website=faculty.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no mention in Cassiodorus' selection of official correspondence of the death of Boethius.

Athalaric died in early 534, and the remainder of Cassiodorus' public career was dominated by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] reconquest and dynastic intrigue among the Ostrogoths. His last letters were drafted in the name of [[Vitiges]]. Around 537–38, he left Italy for [[Constantinople]], from where his successor was appointed, where he remained for almost two decades, concentrating on religious questions. He notably met [[Junillus]], the [[quaestor]] of [[Justinian I]] there. His Constantinopolitan journey contributed to the improvement of his religious knowledge. 

Cassiodorus spent his career trying to bridge the 6th-century cultural divides: between East and West, Greek culture and Latin, Roman and Goth, and between an [[Orthodoxy#Christianity|Orthodox]] people and their [[Arianism|Arian]] rulers. He speaks fondly in his ''Institutiones'' of [[Dionysius Exiguus]], the calculator of the [[Anno Domini]] era.

In his retirement, he founded the [[monastery]] of [[Vivarium_(monastery)|Vivarium]]{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=103}} on his family estates on the shores of the [[Ionian Sea]], and his writings turned to religion.

Cassiodorus' Vivarium "monastery school"&lt;ref&gt;Jean Leclerq, ''The Love of Learning and the Desire for God'', 2nd revised edition (New York: Fordham, Fordham University Press, 1977) 25.&lt;/ref&gt; was composed of two main buildings: a [[coenobitic]] monastery and a retreat, for those who desired a more solitary life. Both were located on the site of the modern Santa Maria de Vetere near [[Squillace]]. The twin structure of Vivarium was to permit coenobitic [[Monk|monks]] and hermits to coexist. The Vivarium appears not to have been governed by a strict monastic rule, such as that of the [[Benedictine Order]]. Rather Cassiodorus' work ''Institutiones'' was written to guide the monks' studies. To this end, the ''Institutiones'' focus largely on texts assumed to have been available in Vivarium's library. The ''Institutiones'' seem to have been composed over a lengthy period of time, from the 530s into the 550s, with redactions up to the time of Cassiodorus' death. Cassiodorus composed the ''Institutiones'' as a guide for introductory learning of both "divine" and "secular" writings, in place of his formerly planned Christian school in Rome:&lt;blockquote&gt;I was moved by divine love to devise for you, with God's help, these introductory books to take the place of a teacher. Through them I believe that both the textual sequence of Holy Scripture and also a compact account of secular letters may, with God's grace, be revealed. &lt;ref&gt;''Institutions'', trans. James W. Halporn and Mark Vessey, ''Cassiodorus: Institutions of Divine and Secular Learning and On the Soul'', TTH 42 (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2004)I.1, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first section of the ''Institutiones'' deals with Christian texts, and was intended to be used in combination with the ''Expositio Psalmorum''. The order of subjects in the second book of the ''Institutiones'' reflected what would become the ''[[Trivium (education)|Trivium]]'' and ''[[Quadrivium]]'' of medieval [[liberal arts]]: grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy. While he encouraged study of secular subjects, Cassiodorus clearly considered them useful primarily as aids to the study of divinity, much in the same manner as [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Cassiodorus' ''Institutiones'' thus attempted to provide what Cassiodorus saw as a well-rounded education necessary for a learned Christian, all ''in uno corpore'', as Cassiodorus put it.&lt;ref&gt;Halporn and Vessey, ''Cassiodorus: Institutions'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The library at Vivarium was still active c. 630, when the monks brought the relics of [[Agathius|Saint Agathius]] from Constantinople, dedicating to him a spring-fed fountain shrine that still exists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708132053/http://centreleonardboyle.com/otherlinks.html Select Abstracts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, its books were later dispersed, the [[Codex Grandior]] of the [[Bible]] being purchased by the Anglo-Saxon [[Ceolfrith]] when he was in Italy in 679–80, and  taken by him to [[Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey|Wearmouth Jarrow]], where it served as the source for the copying of the [[Codex Amiatinus]], which was then brought back to Italy by the now aged Ceolfrith.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Makepeace, http://www.florin.ms/pandect.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the demise of the Vivarium, Cassiodorus' work in compiling classical sources and presenting a sort of bibliography of resources would prove extremely influential in Late Antique Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Halporn and Vessey, ''Cassiodorus: Institutions'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational philosophy ==
Cassiodorus devoted much of his life to supporting education within the Christian community at large. When his proposed theological university in Rome was denied, he was forced to re-examine his entire approach to how material was learned and interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Wand, JWC.  A History of the Early Church. Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd. (Norwich: 1937)&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Variae'' show that, like [[Augustine of Hippo]], Cassiodorus viewed reading as a transformative act for the reader. It is with this in mind that he designed and mandated the course of studies at the Vivarium, which demanded an intense regimen of reading and meditation. By assigning a specific order of texts to be read, Cassiodorus hoped to create the discipline necessary within the reader to become a successful monk. The first work in this succession of texts would be the [[Psalms]], with which the untrained reader would need to begin because of its appeal to emotion and temporal goods.&lt;ref name=ArsRhet&gt;{{cite journal | title =Cassiodorus's "Commentary on the Psalms" as an "Ars Rhetorica" | journal =[[Rhetorica]]| volume =XVII | issue =Winter, 1999 | pages =37–73 | doi=10.1525/rh.1999.17.1.37| year =1999| last1 =Astell| first1 =Ann W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining the rate at which copies of his Psalmic commentaries were issued, it is fair to assess that, as the first work in his series, Cassiodorus's educational agenda had been implemented to some degree of success.&lt;ref name=ArsRhet/&gt;

Beyond demanding the pursuit of discipline among his students, Cassiodorus encouraged the study of the liberal arts. He believed these arts were part of the content of the Bible, and some mastery of them—especially grammar and rhetoric—necessary for a complete understanding of it.&lt;ref name=ArsRhet/&gt;  These arts were divided into [[trivium (education)|trivium]] (which included rhetoric, idioms, vocabulary and etymology) and [[quadrivium]]: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.

==Classical connections==
Cassiodorus is rivalled only by [[Boethius]] in his drive to preserve and explore classical literature during the 6th century AD.&lt;ref name=InflCass&gt;{{cite journal | title =The Influence of Cassiodorus on Medieval Culture | journal =Speculum | volume =XX | issue =October, 1945 | pages =433–442 | doi=10.2307/2856740| jstor =2856740 | last1 =Jones | first1 =Leslie W. | year =1945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="po"&gt;General Audience of Pope Benedict XVI, Boethius and Cassiodorus.

Thus he is unafraid to cite Cicero alongside sacred text, and acknowledge the classical ideal of good being part of the practice of rhetoric.&lt;ref name=ArsRhet/&gt;

His love for classical thought also influenced his administration of Vivarium. Cassiodorus connected deeply with Christian [[neoplatonism]], which saw beauty as concomitant with [[the Good]].  This inspired him to adjust his educational program to support the aesthetic enhancement of manuscripts within the monastery, something which had been practiced before, but not in the universality that he suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =Cassiodorus' Institutes and Christian Book Selection | journal =The Journal of Library History | volume =I | issue =April, 1966 | pages =89–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical learning would by no means replace the role of scripture within the monastery; it was intended to augment the education already under way. It is also worth noting that all Greek and Roman works were heavily screened to ensure only proper exposure to text, fitting with the rest of the structured learning.&lt;ref name=ValInfl&gt;{{cite journal | title =The Value and Influence of Cassiodorus's Ecclesiastical History | journal =The Harvard Theological Review | volume =XLI | issue =January, 1948 | pages =51–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lasting impact==
Cassiodorus' legacy is quietly profound. Before the founding of Vivarium, the copying of manuscripts had been a task reserved for either inexperienced or physically infirm devotees, and was performed at the whim of literate monks. Through the influence of Cassiodorus, the monastic system adopted a more vigorous, widespread, and regular approach to reproducing documents within the monastery.&lt;ref name=NewCass&gt;{{cite journal | title =The New Cassiodorus by EK Rand | journal =Speculum | volume =XIII | issue =October, 1938 | pages =433–447 | doi=10.2307/2849664| jstor =2849664 | last1 =Rand | first1 =E. K. | year =1938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to the development of the monastic lifestyle was perpetuated especially through German religious institutions.&lt;ref name=NewCass/&gt;

This change in daily life also became associated with a higher purpose: the process was not merely associated with disciplinary habit, but also with the preservation of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pergoli Campanelli|first=Alessandro|title=Cassiodoro alle origini dell'idea di restauro|year=2013|publisher=Jaca Book|location=Milano|isbn=978-88-16-41207-1|pages=140|url=https://www.academia.edu/3522730}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Cassiodorus' lifetime, theological study was on the decline and classical writings were disappearing. Even as the victorious [[Ostrogoth]] armies remained in the countryside, they continued to pillage and destroy religious relics in Italy.&lt;ref name=InflCass/&gt; Cassiodorus' programme helped ensure that both classical and sacred literature were preserved through the Middle Ages.

Despite his contributions to monastic order, literature, and education, Cassiodorus' labors were not well acknowledged. After his death he was only partially recognized by historians of the age, including [[Bede]], as an obscure supporter of the Church. In their descriptions of Cassiodorus, medieval scholars have been documented to change his name, profession, place of residence, and even his religion.&lt;ref name=InflCass/&gt; Some chapters from his works have been copied into other texts, suggesting that he may have been read, but not generally known.&lt;ref name=ValInfl/&gt;

==Criticism==
The works not assigned as a part of Cassiodorus' educational program must be examined critically. Because he had been working under the newly dominant power of the Ostrogoths, the writer demonstrably alters the narrative of history for the sake of protecting himself. The same could easily be said about his ideas, which were presented as non-threatening in their approach to peaceful meditation and its institutional isolationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Cassiodorus as Patricius and ex Patricio| journal = Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte | volume = XLI | issue =1990 | pages =499–503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blason Charolais.svg|thumb|180px|Coat of arms of the Counts of Charolais]] 
'''Charolais''' (also Charollais) is a historic region of France, named after the central town of [[Charolles]], and located in today's [[Saône-et-Loire]] ''[[Departments of France|département]]'', in [[Burgundy]].

==History==
It was held by the [[Kingdom of France|French]] noble house of [[Chalon-Arlay]], until in 1237 Count [[John, Count of Chalon|John the Old]] ceded it to Duke [[Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy|Hugh IV of Burgundy]]. The [[county]] of Charolais was inherited by Hugh's granddaughter [[Beatrice of Burgundy, Lady of Bourbon|Beatrice]], who in 1272 married Count [[Robert, Count of Clermont|Robert of Clermont]], a younger son of King [[Louis IX of France]] and progenitor of the [[House of Bourbon]]. In 1314 it passed to Robert's second son [[John of Charolais|John]], whose daughter Beatrice married Count [[John I, Count of Armagnac|John I of Armagnac]] in 1327.

John's grandson Count [[Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac|Bernard VII of Armagnac]] sold the county to Duke [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Philip II of Burgundy]] in 1390. It thus became part of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] and the title 'Count of Charolais' was systematically given to the heir apparent of the incumbent duke. After the death of the last [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Valois-Burgundy]] duke [[Charles the Bold]] at the 1477 [[Battle of Nancy]], the county was seized by King [[Louis XI of France]]–against the fierce resistance by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] archduke [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of Austria]], husband of Charles' daughter [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary]]. After the [[War of the Burgundian Succession]], Charolais finally fell to the Habsburg dynasty according to the 1493 [[Treaty of Senlis]], though it remained a French fief.

The County of Charolais shared a common history with the Imperial [[County of Burgundy]] (''[[Franche-Comté]]''), as both belonged to the [[dowry]] of Maximilian's daughter [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]]. Upon her death in 1530, they passed to her nephew Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and with the Imperial estates of the [[Burgundian Circle]] (the [[Spanish Netherlands]]) were held by [[Habsburg Spain]] under Charles' son King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] from 1569 onwards.

While the County of Burgundy fell to the French Crown upon the 1678 [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]], Charolais was acquired by the Bourbon prince [[Louis, Grand Condé|Louis of Condé]] in 1684. It was not awarded to the French Crown until the death of Count [[Charles, Count of Charolais|Charles of Charolais]] in 1760, when King [[Louis XV of France]] ultimately incorporated it into the [[Estates of Burgundy]].

Although the abdication was considered legal, the dissolution of the imperial bonds was not and several states refused to recognise the end of the empire at the time.{{sfn|Gagliardo|1980|p=281}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3180">An '''Enaree''' or '''Enarei''' ({{lang-grc|ἐναρής}}) was a [[Scythians|Scythian]] [[Shamanism|shaman]]; described as effeminate or androgynous. Scythian shamanism involved [[religious ecstasy]] through the use of [[entheogens]]; they had no temples and worshipped the [[Fundamental forces|forces of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imninalu.net/Eurasians.htm |title=Eurasians |publisher=Im Nin'alu |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herodotus]], the Scythians who pillaged the temple of Aphrodite (see [[Venus Castina]]) at [[Askelon|Ascelon]], and all their descendants after them, were afflicted by the goddess with the “female” sickness: and so the Scythians say that they are afflicted as a consequence of this and also that those who visit Scythian territory see among them the condition of those whom the Scythians call Enarees.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D105%3Asection%3D4 I. 105. § 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus associates their patron goddess, [[Argimpasa]], with [[Aphrodite Urania]] via ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''.

Herodotus also mentions some of their religious practices:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are many diviners among the Scythians, who divine by means of many willow wands as I will show. They bring great bundles of wands, which they lay on the ground and unfasten, and utter their divinations as they lay the rods down one by one; and while still speaking, they gather up the rods once more and place them together again; this manner of divination is hereditary among them. The Enarees, who are hermaphrodites, say that Aphrodite gave them the art of divination, which they practise by means of lime-tree bark. They cut this bark into three portions, and prophesy while they braid and unbraid these in their fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.%204.67&amp;lang=original IV. 67]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Greek physician [[Hippocrates]], who speaks about the Enarees in his work ''[[s:On Airs, Waters, Places|On Airs, Waters, Places]]'', theorized that although the inhabitants of Scythia believe the cause of their effeminacy is divine, he believed the cause of their [[impotency]] was a result of continuous horseback riding, and it was for this reason they have adopted feminine roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |author=Hippocrates |title=On Airs, Waters, Places |wslink=On Airs, Waters, Places#Part XXII |at=Part XXII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George John Griffiths''' [[Queen's Service Order|QSO]] (1933–29 January 2014) was a New Zealand historian, writer, and journalist.

Griffiths started his newspaper career in 1954 at the ''[[Southland Times]]'', based in [[Invercargill]], moving to [[Dunedin]] and joining the ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'' in 1962. He was to work at the latter paper until his retirement in 1991.&lt;ref name="ODT"&gt;"[https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/historian-dies-80 Historian dies at 80]," ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'', 30 January 2014. Retrieved 22 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Griffiths co-founded [[Otago Heritage Books]], which published books on the history of the southern [[South Island]], many of which were edited by Griffiths, and also operated as a central Dunedin bookshop which became a hub for local writers and historians.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Gavin "[http://beattiesbookblog.blogspot.co.nz/2014/02/george-griffiths-rip.html George Griffiths R.I.P.],' ''Beattie's Book Blog – unofficial homepage of the New Zealand book community'', 3 February 2014. Retrieved 22 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote numerous books, many of which were published by Otago Heritage Books, most of them relating to [[History of Otago|Otago history]],&lt;ref name="ODT"/&gt; and contributed many biographical articles to the [[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]].

Griffiths was named as a [[University of Otago]] [[Hocken Fellowship|Hocken fellow]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="commun"&gt;"[http://thecommunityarchive.org.nz/node/78779/description Griffiths, George John, Dr : Business, research and personal papers]," ''thecommunityarchive.org.nz''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2954">[[File:Escudo de Aragón, Vagad y Hurus, 1499.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of the ''Crónica de Aragón'' (1499) showing the earliest illustration of the Aragonese coat-of-arms.]]

'''Gualberto Fabricio de Vagad''' was an [[Aragon]]ese [[Cistercian]] [[Benedictine monk]] and the first historian of the [[Kingdom of Aragon]]. He was born in [[Zaragoza]] in the first third of the fifteenth century and straddles the line between the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. He lived most of his life at the [[Santa Fe Abbey|monastery of Santa María de Santa Fe]], though he also spent some time at [[San Juan de la Peña]]. According to [[Félix de Latassa y Ortín]], besides history he wrote various treatises on [[poetry]] and a compendium of verse.

Vagad's ''magnum opus'', the '''''Crónica de Aragón''''', an [[Aragonese language|vernacular Romance]] history of Aragon from the mythical [[Kingdom of Sobrarbe]] (founded 724) up to the death of [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso V]] (1458), was published in Zaragoza in 1499; its [[incunabula]] survive. It was commissioned by the deputies of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], who named Vagad ''cronista mayor'' (senior chronicler), though the office of ''cronista'' was not formally instituted until the ''[[Parliament|Cortes]]'' of [[Monzón]] in 1547.

For the work Vagad consulted the archives of [[San Juan de la Peña]], [[Real Monasterio de San Victorián|San Victorián]], [[Poblet]], [[Castle of Montearagón|Montearagón]], and [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]] among other archives of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. In international matters he was a Spanish partisan and this bias enters into his history: he considered the [[Emperor Maximilian I]] a Spaniard and made the legendary [[Count Julian]] an Italian. In peninsular matters his Aragonese bias is evident, as when he devalues the conquest of [[Valencia, Valencia|Valencia]] by the Castilian folk hero [[El Cid]] (1094) relative to the conquest of the same city by [[James I of Aragon]] (1236). The work contains three prologues. In the first Vagad heaps praise on Spain in the tradition of [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore's]] ''[[Laus Spaniae]]''; in the second he argues from history for the preeminence of Aragon amongst the kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula; and in the third he defends the importance of Zaragoza as the chief city of Spain. Preoccupied with style, his narrative is frequently interrupted by lengthy and banal arguments. [[Eduard Fueter]], the Swiss historian of [[Universal history|universal historiography]], writes that Vagad's ''Crónica'' contains the "timid critical germs of the medieval tradition" (''tímidos gérmenes de crítica de la tradición medieval'').

''[[Richard the Lionheart]] and [[Saladin]] in the [[Battle of Arsuf]]'']]
The [[historiography]] of the [[crusades]] has been a controversial topic since at least the [[Protestant Reformation]].
The term ''[[:wikt:crusade|croisades]]'' was first used to refer to the entire period from the [[First Crusade]] until the fall of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in French historiography of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;"L'Histoire des Croisades" by Archange de Clermont OFM in ''Traité du Calvaire de Hiérusalem et de Dauphiné'', Lyon (1638).&lt;!--verify if this author actually uses the term in this way! "L'Histoire des Croisades" appears to be the title of a later reprint of an excerpt from his 1638 work--&gt;
[[Louis Maimbourg]], ''Histoire des croisades pour la délivrance de la Terre-Sainte'' (1675/76).  
Contemporary historiographers discussed the topic in terms of the "deeds of the Franks" (''[[Gesta Francorum]]''), or the 
"deeds done across the sea" (''[[outremer]]'';  [[William of Tyre]], ''Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum'').&lt;/ref&gt;
The 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideology as represented by [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[Voltaire]] held up the crusades as an example of [[Medievalism#Renaissance to Enlightenment|medieval barbarism]], while 19th-century [[Romantic nationalism]] tended to paint them in a heroic light, surrounding the crusades with an aura of romance and grandeur, of chivalry and courage.&lt;ref name="Munro"&gt;See Dana Carleton Munro, [http://www.historians.org/info/AHA_history/dcmunro.htm "War and History,' ''American Historical Review'' 32:2 (January 1927): 219–31 online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 20th century, western historiography again tended to be more critical of the crusades, following [[Steven Runciman]] (1951&amp;ndash;4).
Popular opinion, influenced by general trends of [[decolonisation]] and  [[critical theory]] tended to portray the crusades with a sense of "western guilt".&lt;ref name="QuellerMadden"&gt;as in a 1995 BBC television series, presented by Terry Jones, which portrayed the crusades as a long, misguided war of intolerance, ignorance and barbarism against a peaceful and sophisticated Muslim world. Donald E. Queller and Thomas F. Madden. ''The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople'' (2nd ed. 1999), p. 1, Most historians have a negative view of the reliability of the BBC series.&lt;/ref&gt;
In  early 21st literature, a "pluralist" view has become common which tends to generalize the concept of the crusades
to include other medieval military campaigns authorized by the church, such as the [[Northern Crusades]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]] or the [[Reconquista]].&lt;ref&gt;"all those medieval military endeavors that were penitential in nature (like pilgrimages), were authorized by bishops or the Pope, and whose participants typically engaged in the rite of taking the cross and the crusader's vow". {{cite book|author=Nicholas Paul and Suzanne Yeager, eds.|title=Remembering the Crusades: Myth, Image, and Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcxJWdTGSIgC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2012|publisher=Johns Hopkins U.P.|pages=3–4}}.
This tendency is reflected in Tyerman's 2006 ''New History'',  which includes chapters on "The Expansion of the Crusades" (ch. 18:  [[Albigensian Crusade]], 19. [[Fifth Crusade]], 20.  [[Reconquista]], 21:  [[Northern Crusades]]) and  on "The Later Crusades" (ch. 25: "The Eastern Crusades in the Later Middle Ages", ch. 26: "The Crusade and Christian Society in the Later Middle Ages").&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eastern Orthodoxy, the crusades had always been viewed in light of the disastrous attack on Constantinople in the [[Fourth Crusade]].
In the Islamic world, the crusades were mostly ignored prior to the growth of [[Arab nationalism]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Amin Maalouf, ''Crusades Through Arab Eyes''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval historiography==
[[File:Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] (1122–1190) as a crusader. Dedicatory image (c. 1188) in a manuscript of the ''Historia Hierosolymitana'' by [[Robert the Monk]] (written c. 1122).]]
The relevant medieval historiography of the period is edited in  ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'' (RHC, 1841&amp;ndash;1906).
The RHC is divided into five series: 1.  ''Lois'' ("Laws", i.e. the [[Assizes of Jerusalem]]), 2. 
''Historiens occidentaux'' ("Western historians", i.e. texts in Latin and Old French), 3. ''Historiens orientaux'' ("Eastern historians", i.e.  Arabic texts), 4.. ''Historiens grecs'' ("Greek historians") and 5. ''Historiens arméniens'' ("Armenian historians")

Important western histories include the  ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'', [[William of Tyre]]'s ''Historia Ierosolimitana'', [[Peter Tudebode]], [[Raymond of Aguilers]], [[Fulcher of Chartes]], ''[[Gesta Tancredi]]'', [[Robert the Monk]], [[Baldric of Dol]],  [[Albert of Aachen]], [[Ekkehard of Aura]], [[Caffaro di Rustico da Caschifellone]], [[Walter the Chancellor]], [[Benedetto Accolti the Elder]].
Greek Orthodox historians:
[[Michael Psellos]], [[Anna Komnene]], [[John Kinnamos]], [[Niketas Choniates]], [[Nicephorus Gregoras]], [[George Acropolites]].
The Eastern Orthodox view of the Crusades is dominated by the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]] and the establishment of the [[Frankokratia]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. While the [[First Crusade]] was declared upon the request of the Byzantine Emperor, and concluded in triumphal success, the Crusades as a whole 
resulted in the terminal decline of the Byzantine Empire. Although the [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|Byzantine Emperors were restored]] in 1260,
the empire could never fully recover until eventually, weakened by [[List of Byzantine revolts and civil wars#14th century|civil wars]], it fell to the Ottomans [[Fall of Constantinople|in 1453]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Armenian historians: [[Matthew of Edessa]] (d. 1144),   [[Nerses IV|Nerses Shnorhali]] (d. 1173), [[Michael the Syrian]] (d. 1199), [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]] (d. 1271),   [[Nerses of Lambron]] (d. 1198), [[Sempad the Constable]] (d. 1276), [[Hayton of Corycus]] (fl. 1307).

Relevant eastern (Muslim) historiographies include works by  [[Ali ibn al-Athir]] (d. 1233), 
[[Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad]] (d. 1234), [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd al-Latif]] (d. 1231),  [[Ibn Jubayr]] (d. 1217), [[Ibn Khallikan]] (d. 1282), [[Abu al-Feda]] (d. 1331).
Contemporary Muslim historiographers such as [[Ali ibn al-Athir]] refer to the Crusades as the "Frankish Wars" ({{lang|ar| حروب الفرنجة}}).  The term used in modern Arabic, {{lang|ar|حملات صليبية}} ''ḥamalāt ṣalībiyya'', lit. "[[:wikt:حملة|campaigns]] of the [[:wikt:صليب|cross]]" is a loan translation of the term ''crusade'' as used in Western historiography.&lt;ref&gt;J. Determann, The Crusades in Arabic Schoolbooks (2007), p. 13.&lt;!--"In the nineteenth century, Arabic literature underwent a “renaissance” (nahḍa) under European influences. History, together with nearly all literature and science, adopted Western topics and methods and was influenced by Western norms, points of view and conceptualisations. This led to the re-emergence of the primarily Western topic of the crusades in Arab historiography. Under Western influence, the topic became mostly termed in Arabic ḥamalāt ṣalībiyya “crusader campaigns” or ḥurūb ṣalībiyya “crusader wars” (from ṣalīb “cross”). Besides the medieval terms for the crusaders, rūm or firandj/farandj or ifrandj, a new word ṣalībiyyūn, literally, “persons related to the cross,” is now in common use." --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Later Muslim historiography did not focus on the Crusades as a single or coherent event. One main reason for this is that the Crusades in retrospect figure as more of a marginal issue compared to the final collapse of the [[Caliphate]] under the [[Mongol invasions]] and the eventual replacement of [[Arabs|Arab]] rule by the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]], which suppressed Arab nationalism for the following seven centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, ''The Crusades, Islamic Perspectives'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the "[[Islamic Golden Age]]" was thus only partially due to the Crusades, and more so to the [[Turkic expansion|Turkic]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] expansions. According to modern historians of Islamic history such as Murphy (1976) and [[Peter Mansfield (historian)|Mansfield]] (2003), the collapse of the Caliphate led to the development of "intellectual barriers" and "isolationist policies" in the Muslim world.&lt;ref name="Peter Mansfield"&gt;Murphy, Thomas Patrick. The Holy War. Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1976. pg. 198.
A History of the Middle East, Second Edition, London: Penguin Books, 2003, p 21. "Assaulted from all quarters, the Muslim world turned in on itself. It became oversensitive [and] defensive… attitudes that grew steadily worse as worldwide evolution, a process from which the Muslim world felt excluded, continued."&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable contemporary accounts by Jewish authors include the ''[[Solomon bar Simson Chronicle]]'' (c. 1140), the chronicle of [[Eliezer bar Nathan]] (d. 1170), the  ''[[Mainz Anonymous]]'', and the works of [[Ephraim of Bonn]] (d. 1200).

==Modern historiography==
Influential historiographical works on the Crusades include: 
*[[Voltaire]], ''Histoire des Croisades'' (1750, 1751)
*[[Edward Gibbon]] [[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|(1776&amp;ndash;1789)]], edited as  ''The Crusades'' (1870);
*[[Charles Mills (historian)|Charles Mills]], ''[[History of the Crusades for the Recovery and Possession of the Holy Land]]'' (1820);
*[[Joseph François Michaud]], ''Histoire des Croisades'' (1811&amp;ndash;1840)
*[[René Grousset]], ''[[:fr:Histoire des croisades et du royaume franc de Jérusalem|L'Histoire des croisades et du royaume franc de Jérusalem]]'', 3 vols.  (1934&amp;ndash;1936)
*[[Steven Runciman]], ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'' (1951-4);
*[[Christopher Tyerman]], ''God's War: A New History of the Crusades'' (2006).

The popular prevailing view in the nineteenth and early twentieth century originated in the writings of the Scottish novelist [[Sir Walter Scott]] and the French historian [[Joseph-Francois Michaud]]. Scott published four crusade based novels between 1819 and 1831. Influenced by [[the Enlightenment]] and the philosopher-historian [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], Scott's view was the crusades were the incursions of glamorous but uneducated western Europeans into a superior civilization. Michaud published his influential Histoire des croisades between 1812 and 1822 depicting the crusades as glorious instruments of nationalism and proto-imperialism. These incompatible views agreed only on a crusade was defined by its opposition to Islam, but began to merge in the 1920s as crusading began to be interpreted in social and economic terms by Liberal economic historians within an imperialist context  assuming that crusading was an early example of colonialism. So Scott's Enlightenment inferior culture attacking a more sophisticated culture mixed with Michaud's Romantic proto-colonialist conviction. By the 1950s this established a neo-imperialistic and materialistic orthodoxy  that remains the popular perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2009|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Runciman]]'s three volume ''[[A History of the Crusades|History of the Crusades]]'' (1951–54) marks a turn from the idealization of the Crusades as heroic enterprise in the 19th century to their denunciation as "a barbarian invasion", primarily of the Byzantine Empire, among a current of historiography of the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle (2008) says that for his day Runciman was the "greatest historian of the Crusades."  He reports that, "Prior to Runciman, in the early part of the [20th] century, historians related the Crusades as an idealistic attempt of Christendom to push Islam back." Runciman regarded the Crusades "as a barbarian invasion of a superior civilization, not that of the Muslims but of the Byzantines." {{cite book|author=John M Riddle|title=A History of the Middle Ages, 300 - 1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&amp;pg=PA315|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group, Incorporated|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Peters (2011) says that Runciman's work "instantly became the most widely known and respected single-author survey of the subject in English."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Peters|title=The First Crusade: "The Chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres" and Other Source Materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSOSJWG3E2MC&amp;pg=PA314|year=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Madden (2005) stresses the impact of Runciman's style and viewpoint: as having "single-handedly crafted the current popular concept of the crusades" by painting the crusaders as "simpletons or barbarians".
&lt;ref&gt;"It is no exaggeration to say that Runciman single-handedly crafted the current popular concept of the crusades. The reasons for this are twofold. First, he was a learned man with a solid grasp of the chronicle sources. Second, and perhaps more important, he wrote beautifully.  The picture of the crusades that Runciman painted owed much to current scholarship yet much more to Sir Walter Scott. Throughout his history Runciman portrayed the crusaders as simpletons or barbarians seeking salvation through the destruction of the sophisticated cultures of the east. In his famous "summing-up" of the crusades he concluded that "the Holy War in itself was nothing more than a long act of intolerance in the name of God, which is a sin against Holy Ghost." {{cite book|author=Thomas F Madden|title=The New Concise History Of The Crusades|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKYxKsgVpmMC&amp;pg=PA216|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An attempt at an updated account of the period was presented by Christopher Tyerman with his ''God's War: A New History of the Crusades'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;"[Tyerman] accurately, if perhaps with a bit of hubris, notes that Runciman's work is now outdated and seriously flawed."  Mark K. Vaughn, review of Tyerman, ''God's War: A New History of the Crusades'', in ''Naval War College Review,'' (2007) 60#2 p 159&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Secular critics of the crusades{{clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--"secular critics"? do we mean opinion journalism? --&gt; has paralleled the Crusades with the Islamic concept of ''[[jihad]]'' as comparable approaches to a religious [[just war|justification of war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=95001224 "Opinion"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''{{year needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opposing position{{by whom|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--more opinion journalism cited to counter the original opinion journalism? [[WP:CITE]]?--&gt;  emphasizes the offensive nature of Islamic jihad as opposed to the intrinsically defensive nature of the Crusades as  a project to re-conquer territory lost to the Islamic expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_v37/ai_3890330 Findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This debate has taken place in the context of contemporary [[Jihadism]] and the US [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;!--WHICH IS why this entire "crusades in recent journalism" is not relevant to this article's topic in the narrow sense.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0919/p12s2-woeu.html CS monitor]
[[George W. Bush]] in 2002 described his anti-terrorism campaign as a ''crusade'' but was compelled to repudiate the term when it was pointed out that the word, because of the historical events to which it referred in the Middle East, was regarded as offensive by some Muslims and Jews.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Illston says "the field of medieval gender studies is a growing one, and nowhere is this expansion more evident than the recent increase in studies which address the roles of medieval women in times of war....this change in research has been invaluable." He provides a 20-page bibliography of dozens of recent scholarly books and articles, most of them connected to the crusades.&lt;ref&gt;James Michael Illston, "'An Entirely Masculine Activity'?
Women and War in the High and Late Middle Ages Reconsidered," (Thesis,  Department of History, University of Canterbury, 2009) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the technical scholarship, a plethora of popular treatments have appeared in the early 21st century. Thomas Madden has discussed modern misconceptions about the Crusades that appear in nonscholarly writings.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F Madden (2005). The New Concise History Of The Crusades. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish historiography, the Crusades are mostly seen in the context of their being accompanied by the first displays of  [[History of antisemitism#Crusades|antisemitism in medieval Europe]]. The social position of the Jews in western Europe was distinctly worsened, and legal restrictions increased during and after the Crusades.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gottheil, Joseph Jacobs, [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4785-crusades-the "The Crusades"]  ''Jewish Encyclopedia''.
"The undisciplined mobs accompanying the first three Crusades attacked the Jews in Germany, France, and England, and put many of them to death, leaving behind for centuries strong feelings of ill will on both sides. The social position of the Jews in western Europe was distinctly worsened by the Crusades, and legal restrictions became frequent during and after them."
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular reception==
===Middle Ages===
The crusades and their leaders were romanticized in popular literature of the late medieval period; the ''[[Chanson d'Antioche]]'' was a [[chanson de geste]] dealing with the First Crusade, and the [[Song of Roland]], dealing with the era of the similarly romanticized [[Charlemagne]], was directly influenced by the experience of the crusades, going so far as to replace Charlemagne's historic [[Basque people|Basque]] opponents with Muslims. A popular theme for [[troubadour]]s was the knight winning the love of his lady by going on crusade in the east.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

[[File:Barbarossa01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The ever-living [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], in his mountain cave: a late 19th-century German woodcut]]
In the 14th century, [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] was united with the [[Trojan War]] and the adventures of [[Alexander the Great]] against a backdrop for military and courtly heroics of the [[Nine Worthies]] who stood as popular secular [[culture hero]]es into the 16th century, when more critical literary tastes ran instead to [[Torquato Tasso]] and Rinaldo and Armida, Roger and Angelica. Later, the rise of a more authentic sense of history among literate people brought the Crusades into a new focus for the Romantic generation in the romances of Sir [[Walter Scott]] in the early 19th century. Crusading imagery could be found even in the Crimean War, in which the United Kingdom and France were allied with the Muslim Ottoman Empire, and in [[World War I]], especially [[Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby's]] capture of Jerusalem in 1917.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In Spain, the popular reputation of the Crusades is outshone by the particularly Spanish history of the ''Reconquista''. [[El Cid]] is the central figure.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
In a broader sense, ''crusade'' was used, in a [[rhetoric]]al and [[metaphor]]ical sense, to identify as righteous any war that was given a [[religion|religious]] or [[morality|moral]] justification.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Linder (2001) examines 15th-century Catholic Church liturgy designed to generate support for the war effort against the Turks and to legitimize its aims. Two types of ''Missae Contra Turcos''  were used: masses converted to this function through the addition of appropriate three core prayers and complete dedicated masses. The most popular example of the first type was the triple prayer set originally established by Clement V as a Holy Land crusade liturgy and subsequently mobilized against the Turks. The second type is represented by nine different mass formularies that were introduced after the fall of Constantinople in 1453.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} 
Most surviving liturgies are of German or French provenance, indicating extensive use not only among the front-line populations but also in areas far removed from any threat. The liturgy displays its intense crisis rhetoric. Its predominant stance of vulnerability and defensiveness entailed aggressive mobilization and the conceptualization of the Turk as the actual, specific manifestation of the generic infidel, the competing religious Other; and the remarkable continuity - in form and in content - that linked this liturgy with its parent liturgies (mainly those of the campaigns against the pagans and the Holy Land Crusades) further accentuated these traits. The communicative function and value of this liturgy is highlighted by the concentration of the direct, unmediated communicative elements in that part of the mass that was the most accessible to the laity.&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Linder, "The War Liturgy Against the Turks in the Late Middle Ages." ''Historia: Journal of the Historical Society of Israel'' (in Hebrew) (2001) (8): 73-105. {{ISSN|0334-4843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
{{see|Medievalism}}

In the 19th century,  romantic writers like novelist Sir [[Walter Scott]] created heroic images of the crusaders. The romantics and conservative adherents of the European anciens régimes appropriated crusading imagery for their own 19th-century political goals, downplaying religion to fit within a modern, secular context and presenting crusades as a counterpoint to liberal ideas of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2009|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Salle des Croisades]]'' in the north wing of the  [[Palace of Versailles]] opened in 1843, commissioned  by king [[Louis-Philippe]], at a time when [[France]] was seized with enthusiasm with its historical past, and especially the period of the Crusades. The rooms are filled with over 120 paintings related to the Crusades.&lt;ref name="Riley-Smith"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CsHN3c73w10C&amp;pg=PA54 ''The crusades, Christianity, and Islam'' by Jonathan Simon Christopher Riley-Smith p.54]&lt;/ref&gt;

Knobler (2006) examines the use of the crusades as a national symbol from the 19th century to the 1910s in France, Spain, the Ottoman Empire, Ethiopia, Britain, Russia, and Bulgaria. The Enlightenment and its secular ideological successors held the crusades as an example of medieval barbarity. Enlightenment thinkers like historian-philosophers [[Voltaire]] and [[David Hume]] denounced the crusades, as did the historian of Byzantium [[Edward Gibbon]], who wrote:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The principle of the crusades was a savage fanaticism; and the most important effects were analogous to the cause…. The belief of the Catholics was corrupted by new legends…. The active spirit of the Latins preyed on the vitals of their reason and religion…. The lives and labours of millions, which were buried in the East, would have been more profitably employed in the improvement of their native country.&lt;ref name="Gibbon"&gt;Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,'' (1776), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hy8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PT249&amp;lpg=PT249&amp;dq=%22principle+of+the+crusades+was+a+savage+fanaticism%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=PGcJRsXv2k&amp;sig=gH4PAb31uRoQu2u54z7h_hzGp8U&amp;hl=en ch 61 p. 1086]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Knobler (2006) explores three primary themes: memory of the crusades as it relates to debates over the generation and use of national symbols; the crusader as a romantic hero; and the Muslim recollection of the crusades as a shameful blot on the past of Christian nations. The crusades appealed to many Europeans because they reflected a morally unambiguous time, sparked romanticized images of warfare in a time of imperialist expansion, and provided heroic templates for modern "crusading" imperialist heroes.&lt;ref name="Knobler"&gt;Adam Knobler, "Holy Wars, Empires, and the Portability of the Past: the Modern Uses of Medieval Crusades." ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 2006 48(2): 293-325. {{ISSN|0010-4175}} Fulltext: [[Cambridge Journals]]; see also Elizabeth Siberry, ''The New Crusaders: Images of the Crusades in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic world===
There was little interest in the crusades in Islamic culture prior to the 20th century.  Carole Hillenbrand has argued that Arab historians have often taken a Western viewpoint because they have historically been opposed to Turkish control of their homelands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carole Hillenbrand|title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips (2005) summarizes the general indifference by stating that "most Muslims" see the Crusades as "just another invasion among many in their history".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Phillips,  ''The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople'' (2005).{{page needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The veneration of [[Saladin]] as chivalrous opponent of the Crusaders likewise finds no reflection in Islamic tradition before the visit of  [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II]] to Saladin's tomb in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;The Kaiser laid a wreath on the tomb baring the inscription, "A Knight without fear or blame who often had to teach his opponents the right way to practice chivalry." Grousset (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; The visit, coupled with anti-imperialist sentiments, led nationalist Arabs to reinvent the image of Saladin and portray him as a hero of the struggle against the West. The image of Saladin they used was the romantic one created by [[Walter Scott]] and other Europeans in the West at the time. It replaced Saladin's reputation as a figure who had been largely forgotten in the Muslim world, eclipsed by more successful figures such as [[Baybars]] of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Riley Smith, Jonathan, "The Crusades, Christianity and Islam", (Columbia 2008), p. 63-66&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Arab states have sought to commemorate Saladin through various measures, often based on the image created of him in the 19th-century west.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, Thomas F.: ''The Concise History of the Crusades''; 3rd edition, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013. pp. 201-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewed interest in the period is comparatively recent, arising in the context of modern [[Jihadist]] propaganda calling for war on the [[Western world|Western]] "crusaders".&lt;ref&gt;"There is a straight line for propagandists to draw," [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4508401.stm Highly charged], BBC News, May 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  
Notably, a [[fatwa]] signed by  [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] in 1998 called for [[jihad]] against "the crusader-Zionist alliance" (referring to the  [[United States]] and [[Israel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ict.org.il/articles/fatwah.htm|title=Text of Fatwah Urging Jihad Against Americans|accessdate=May 15, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422210853/http://www.ict.org.il/articles/fatwah.htm|archivedate=April 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2008, The ''Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World'' claimed that "many Muslims consider the Crusades to be a symbol of Western hostility toward Islam".{{failed verification|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;John Trumpbour, "Crusades" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World'', ed.

The term ''ṣalībiyyūn'' "crusader", a 19th-century loan translation from Western historiography, is now in common use as a pejorative; Salafi preacher [[Wagdy Abd el-Hamied Mohamed Ghoneim|Wagdy Ghoneim]] has used it interchangeably with ''naṣārā'' and ''masīḥiyyīn'' as a term for Christians in general.&lt;ref&gt;"Waǧdī Ghunaym uses the term 'ṣalībiyyīn' not so much in the meaning of foreign 'crusaders' but interchangeably with naṣārā and masīḥiyyīn to designate all Christians, including the Copts in Egypt."

'''Iha Fuyū''' (伊波普猷, March 15, 1876 – August 13, 1947) was the ''father of Okinawaology'' and a Japanese scholar who studied various aspects of Japanese and Okinawan culture, customs, linguistics, and lore.  His signature was '''Ifa Fuyu''' in English, because of the Okinawan pronunciation. Iha studied linguistics in the [[University of Tokyo]] and was devoted to the study of Okinawan linguistics, folklore, and history. His most famous book on the subject, ''Ko Ryūkyū'' (''Old Ryūkyū''), was published in 1911 and remains one of the best works on Okinawan studies. He devoted much time to the discovery of the origins of Okinawan people to establish their history. He had considerable influence not only on the study of Okinawan folklore but also of Japanese folklore.

==Life==
*In 1876, he was born in [[Naha]] as an eldest son of a lower-class [[pechin]].
*In 1891, he entered Okinawa Middle School, now corresponding to [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] High School.
*In 1895, he was dismissed from school, because he was a leader of a student strike; they requested the resignation of the then principal who dropped the subject of English (English is needed for higher schools).
*In 1896, he entered Meijigikai Middle School in Tokyo, followed by the Third Higher School (Now [[Kyoto University]]).
*In 1903, he entered the linguistic course, Department of Literature, [[Tokyo University]].
*In 1906, he graduated from Tokyo University.
*In 1910, he was appointed the director of Okinawa Prefectural Library.
*In 1917, he organized the study of [[Esperanto]].
*In 1918, he lectured on the [[Bible]] at a church.
*In 1921, he was appointed the director of Okinawa Prefectural Library formally.
*In 1924, he resigned from the library and went to [[Tokyo]] to study more.
*In 1935, he lectured on Omorosoushi at [[Kokugakuin University]].
*In 1945, he assumed the post of the first president of the Association of Okinawan People.
*On August 13, 1947, he died at the house of Higa Shuncho.

==Achievements==

==''Ko Ryukyu''==
This is his representative work and has remained an introduction to Okinawaology. He had corrected previous articles many times, and the reader should read the most recent edition.

===Linguistic study===
Studying various words of Ryukyu and Japan used in days gone by, he came to the conclusion that Okinawa and Japan share the same mother tongue. The studied words include ''akaru, akezu, akatonki, amori, etsuri, fuguri'' (scrotum), ''fuku,  hae'' (glory), ''hau, hiji, hiraku, hoso'' (umbricus), ''kanashi, iga, ikasarete, ikibui, ikutokoro, ime, iriki, kabuchi, kotoi, kuwanari, magu, majimono, mamaki, maru, minjai, mitsumi, monowata,  mumuji, naegu, nai'' (earthquake),  ''nasu, nuuji, sakuri, sayumi, shichiyadan, shishi, taani, tane'' (penis), ''tsukakamachi, tsukura, tubi, ugonaari, uwanari, wa, watamashi, yagusami, yokoshi, yomu'', and ''yuimaharu''.

===The recent trend of the History of the Ryukyus===
[[File:Sai On.jpg|upright|thumb|Sai On (Gushi-chan Bunjaku)]]
Three representative statesmen were described. They were given posthumous court ranks at the enthronement of [[Emperor Taishō]], and Iha gave a lecture about them at the Okinawa Normal School. They were [[Sai On]], [[Haneji Choshu]] (Shō Shōken (向象賢)) and [[Giwan Chōho]]. They managed to govern Ryukyu between [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[China]]. Iha regarded them as the most important figures in Ryukyuan history.

Sai On's advice to the King: Negotiations with China are not difficult. If difficulties will arise, Kume people can manage to handle them. But Japan is not so. On one day, with only a piece of paper, a King may lose his position and it is definitely from Japan.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Okinawa's stand: to Okinawa, who will rule in China does not matter. Okinawa is not allowed to stick to justice. Okinawan people endure everything in order to live, or eat. An Okinawan saying says that who will let us eat, whoever it is, is our master. This is the fate of Okinawan people until the day of the placement of Okinawa Prefecture. To Japan, namely to the Shimazu clan, it did not know how to treat Okinawa soon after the establishment of Okinawa Prefecture.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Seven kinds of ''Omoro Sōshi''===

''[[Omoro Sōshi]]'' is a collection of songs, 1553 poems and 1267 poems(when the same songs are excluded) in 22 volumes, starting in the middle of the 13th century and ending in the middle of the 17th century. It may be called the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' of Okinawa. ''Omoro'' is the abbreviation of ''Omori uta'', or songs sung in the sacred places of Ryukyu. The themes of the ''Omoro'' include the origin of Ryukyu, Kings, Heroes, Voyages, Poets, Sceneries, Heaven and Stars, very rarely Romance. ''Omoro'' is the primary source for studying the [[Ryukyuan languages]] and ideologies.

===The problem of students studying in China (Kansho)===
China allowed Ryukyuan princes and others to study in China; at first, Ryukyuan students did not get good achievements. The great king [[Shō Shin]] started to allow the people of the town of Kume, who had come from China only 128 years before, to study in China. They spoke Chinese of course, and got high achievements. Four students from Kume who studied in Nanjing came back seven years later. Four others on the next turn, came back seven years later. The people of Kume eventually came to believe that students only came from Kume. Toward the end of the 18th century, the Ryukyuan government, based in [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]], realized that education and politics went hand in hand and thought students should be also from Shuri. The people of Kume resisted with strikes. This is called the Kansho Problem or Soudou.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===The P sound in Okinawan dialects===
The changes of the sound of P → F → H in Ryukyuan dialects suggest the changes from P through F to H in the languages of historical Japan proper.
Take care that this is in ''Ko Ryukyu''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ko Ryukyu'', 2000. p375-386&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Late Middle Japanese]]　it is written that although Proto-Japanese had a *[p], by Old Japanese it had already become [ɸ] and subsequently [h] during Early Modern Japanese where it remains today.

Mythologies in Okinawa.

==Okinawaology==
Okinawaology is not an independent field of science, but a general term of various aspects of Okinawa studies. Okinawaology originated from Iha's ''Ko Ryukyu (Old Ryukyu)''.

===In General===
Since Ryukyu was annexed by Japan, the Okinawan people tried to Japanize themselves, while there was a tendency that they were treated as an inferior people at that time. With this as the background, Iha studied the culture of both Japan and Okinawa, especially, the languages, history of Okinawa, and proposed the Okinawan people and Japanese people had the same ancestors. His studies started from Omorosoushi, and covered the study of history, linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, study of religions, mythology, the study of civilization, ethnology and literature.  Using the [[Okinawan language]], he tried to raise the pride of Okinawans in their land. His proposals have been established as the basis of Okinawaology. Those who study Okinawaology are not restricted to scholars. Okinawaology covers many other branches, such as politics, economics, laws, and natural circumstances.

==Tomb==
His tomb is at [[Urasoe Castle]] showing the following [[epitaph]].

The concept holds that technologies like [[virtual reality]], [[user created content]] and [[YouTube]] will change the way humans interact with each other and how they create economic and [[social structure]]s.  A key concept is that the rise of the immersive virtual reality, the [[cyberspace]] or the [[metaverse]] will raise the value of imagination work of designers, artists, video makers and actors over rational thinking as a foundation of culture and economics.

== Origins of the term ==

The terms ''imagination age'' and "age of imagination" were first introduced in an essay by designer and writer Charlie Magee in 1993. His essay,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oss.net/dynamaster/file_archive/040320/4a32a59dcdc168eced6517b5e6041cda/OSS1993-01-21.pdf "The Age of Imagination: Coming Soon to a Civilization Near You"]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Age of Imagination: Coming Soon to a Civilization Near You" proposes the idea that the best way to assess the evolution of human civilization is through the lens of communication.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most successful groups throughout human history have had one thing in common: when compared to their competition they had the best system of communication. The fittest communicators—whether tribe, citystate, kingdom, corporation, or nation—had (1) a larger percentage of people with (2) access to (3) higher quality information, (4) a greater ability to transform that information into knowledge and action, (5) and more freedom to communicate that new knowledge to the other members of their group.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Imagination Age" has been popularized as a cultural and economic philosophy by artist, writer and cultural philosopher [[Rita J. King]] in her November 2007 essay for the [[British Council]], [http://www.britishcouncil.org/tn2020-research-findings-authors-king.htm "The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age"] where she began using the phrase, "Toward a New Global Culture and Economy in the Imagination Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/tn2020-research-findings-authors-king.htm |title=The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age |publisher=British Council |date= |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; King further refined the development of her thinking in a 2008 Paris essay entitled, "Our Vision for Sustainable Culture in the Imagination Age"&lt;ref name="vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theimaginationage.net/2008/02/our-vision-for-sustainable-culture-in.html |title=Our Vision for Sustainable Culture in the Imagination Age |publisher=The Imagination AGe |date= |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she states, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Active participants in the Imagination Age are becoming cultural ambassadors by introducing virtual strangers to unfamiliar customs, costumes, traditions, rituals and beliefs, which humanizes foreign cultures, contributes to a sense of belonging to one's own culture and fosters an interdependent perspective on sharing the riches of all systems. Cultural transformation is a constant process, and the challenges of modernization can threaten identity, which leads to unrest and eventually, if left unchecked, to violent conflict. Under such conditions it is tempting to impose homogeneity, which undermines the highly specific systems that encompass the myriad luminosity of the human experience.&lt;ref name="vision" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Rita J. King has expanded her interpretation of the Imagination Age concept through speeches at the [[O'Reilly Media]], [[TED (conference)|TED]], [[Cusp Conference|Cusp]], and [[Business Innovation Factory]] conferences.&lt;ref name="congratulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theimaginationage.net/2009/09/congratulations-to-rita-j-king-gov-20.html

The term ''imagination age'' was subsequently popularized in techno-cultural discourse by other writers, [[futurists]] and technologists, who attributed the term to Rita J. King, including [[Jason Silva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-silva/loveland-and-the-imaginat_b_786616.html |title=LOVELAND and the Imagination Age |publisher=The Huffington Post |date= |accessdate=2010-11-22 |first=Jason |last=Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tish Shute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugotrade.com/2007/11/19/global-communities-in-the-imagination-age/ |title=Global Communities in The Imagination Age |publisher=UgoTrade |date= |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technology entrepreneur and publisher of Augmented Reality and emerging technology blog "[http://www.UgoTrade.com UgoTrade]".

Earlier, one-time, references to the imagination age can be found attributed to Carl W. Olson in his 2001 book [http://www.paperbackswap.com/Boss-Dead-Leadership-Carl-W-Olson/book/0759615764/ "The Boss is Dead...: Leadership Breakthroughs for the Imagination Age] {{ISBN|0-7596-1576-4}}&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;Carl W. Olson "The Boss is Dead...: Leadership Breakthroughs for the Imagination Age" {{ISBN|0-7596-1576-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtual worlds developer Howard Stearns in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventing-the-future.wetmachine.com/content/the-imagination-age |title=The Imagination Age |publisher=Wetmachine |date= |accessdate=2005-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cathilea Robinett]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/policy-management/A-Champion-for-the-Imagination-Age.html |title=A Champion for the Imagination Age |publisher=Government Technology |date= |accessdate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic rise of imagination==

The imagination age would be a society and culture dominated by an [[imagination economy]].  The idea relies on a key [[Marxist]] concept that culture is a superstructure fully conditioned by the economic substructure.  According to Marxist thinking certain kinds of culture and art were made possible by the adoption of farming technology.  Then with the rise of industry new forms of political organization (democracy, militarism, fascism, communism) were made possible along with new forms of culture (mass media, news papers, films).  These resulted in people changing.  In the case of industrialization people were trained to become more literate, to follow time routines, to live in urban communities.

The concept of the imagination age extends this to a new order emerging presently.

An imagination economy is defined by some thinkers as an economy where intuitive and creative thinking create economic value, after logical and rational thinking has been outsourced to other economies.&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, Geoffrey [http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/05/magazines/fortune/imaginationeconomy.fortune/index.htm "The imagination economy"], FORTUNE Magazine, July 5, 2006, Reproduced in CNN Money online&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Cox (academic)|Michael Cox]] Chief Economist at [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]] argues that economic trends show a shift away from information sector employment and job growth towards creative jobs.  Jobs in publishing, he has pointed out are declining while jobs for designers, architects, actors &amp; directors, software engineers and photographers are all growing.  This shift in job creation is a sign the beginning of the Imagination Age.&lt;ref&gt;needs reference&lt;/ref&gt; The 21st century has seen a growth in games and interactive media jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Brockman, NPR 2010  [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122290666&amp;sc=fb&amp;cc=fp "When Play Means Pay: Video Game Jobs On The Rise"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox argues that the skills can be viewed as a  "hierarchy of human talents",&lt;ref&gt;Phil Searle [http://www.ssonetwork.com/business-process-outsourcing/articles/q-a-michael-cox-chief-economist-federal-reserve-ba "Q&amp;A: Michael Cox, Chief Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas"]&lt;/ref&gt; with raw physical effort as the lowest form of value creation, above this skilled labor and information entry to creative reasoning and emotional intelligence.  Each layer provides more value creation than the skills below it, and the outcome of [[globalization]] and [[automation]] is that labor is made available for higher level skills that create more value.  Presently these skills tend to be around imagination, social and emotional intelligence.

==The ages of human history==
The ideas of the Imagination Age depends in large part upon an idea of progress through history because of technology, outlined by [[Marx]].

The idea is that human culture has moved through a number of major stages of development.  According to this idea civilization has progressed through the following ages or [[Epoch (reference date)|Epochs]]:
*[[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Age]] – Age dominated by work with wooden tool and animals to produce food.
*[[Industrialisation|Industrial Age]] – Economy dominated by factories producing commodities.
*[[Information Age]] – Economy dominated by [[knowledge workers]] using computer and other electronic devices in sectors like research, finance, consulting, information technology and other services.

Following this is a new [[paradigm]] created by virtual technology, high speed internet, and other technologies.  This new paradigm, the argument goes, will create a new kind of global culture and economy called the Imagination Age.

==Technology and the imagination age==
Key to the idea that imagination is becoming the key commodity of our time is a confidence that Virtual Reality technology, like [[Oculus Rift]] and [[HoloLens]] will emerge to take much of the place of the current text and graphic dominated Internet. This will provide a 3-D Internet where imagination and creativity over information and search will be key talents to creating user experience and value.

The concept is not limited to just virtual reality. Charlie Magee states that the technology that will develop during the imagination age would include:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best bet is on a hybrid breakthrough created by the meshing of [[nanotechnology]], computer science (including [[artificial intelligence]]), [[biotechnology]] (including [[biochemistry]], [[biopsychology]], etc.), and virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Magee [http://www.oss.net/dynamaster/file_archive/040320/4a32a59dcdc168eced6517b5e6041cda/OSS1993-01-21.pdf "The Age of Imagination Coming Soon to a Civilization Near You."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' [[Raymond Kurzweil]] states that future combination of AI, nano-technology, and biotechnology will create a world where anything that can be imagined will be possible, raising the importance of imagination as the key mode of human thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil, Ray "[[The Singularity is Near]]" Viking Penguin 2005 p299-300 {{ISBN|0-7156-3561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture, economy and the imagination age==
Imagination Age as a philosophical tenet heralding a new wave of cultural and economic innovation appears to have been first introduced by Rita J. King in a 2008 collection of essays for the [[British Council]] entitled, "The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age"&lt;ref name="britishcouncil"&gt;[http://www.britishcouncil.org/tn2020-research-findings-authors-king.htm "The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age"]&lt;/ref&gt; Says King, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than exist as an unwitting victim of circumstance, all too often unaware of the impact of having been born in a certain place at a certain time, to parents firmly nestled within particular values and socioeconomic brackets, millions of people are creating new virtual identities and meaningful relationships with others who would have remained strangers, each isolated within their respective realities.&lt;ref name="britishcouncil" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Global implications==
Rita J. King has been the single major advocate of the Imagination Age concept and its implications on cultural relations, identity and the transformation of the global economy and culture. Rita J. King has expounded on the concept through speeches at the [[O'Reilly Media]] and [[TED (conference)|TED]] conferences&lt;ref name="congratulations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="understandingislam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt; and has argued that virtual world technology and changes in people's ability to imagine other lives could promote world understanding and reduce [[cultural conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.treet.tv/metanomics-imagination-age Playing Metanomics :: The Imagination Age]&lt;/ref&gt; Some public policy experts have argued the emergence of the Imagination Age out of the Information Age will have a major impact on overall public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Tod Newcombe [http://www.govtech.com/pcio/128301 "A Champion for the Imagination Age"] Public CIO&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential timeframe==

Some argue it has already started. They state that imagination is the most valued skill in our modern society.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sultan Abdullah Bahabri 2003 [http://archive.biomedcentral.com/1476-3591/1/2 "The Buzz and the Sting"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Medieval Congress''' ('''IMC''') is an annual academic conference held for scholars specializing in, or with an interest in, the study of the European [[Middle Ages]] (c. 300-1500). It is organised and administered by the [[Institute for Medieval Studies]] at the [[University of Leeds]] and is held in early July. The Congress is the largest annual conference in any subject in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/features/Here39s-a-taste-of-life.1625362.jp | title = Here's a taste of life in those medieval dining halls| publisher = [[Yorkshire Evening Post]]| date = 2006-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Fat-monks-and-other-medieval.821610.jp | title = Fat Monks and other Medieval Mysteries| publisher = [[Yorkshire Evening Post]]| date = 2004-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; regularly attracting over 2000 registered participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/barsandclubs/Going-down-in-history.4282943.jp | title = Going down in History| publisher = [[Yorkshire Evening Post]]| date = 2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/jul/14/conference-parallels-big-society-with-medieval-times | title = Conference parallels 'big society' with medieval times| work = [[The Guardian]]| date = 2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Aim, Scope and Participation==
The main aim of the Congress is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for discussion on all aspects of the European Middle Ages (c. 300-1500). Each year’s Congress has one special thematic strand which focuses on an area of interdisciplinary study in a wider context. However, this special thematic strand is not exclusive, and alongside it the IMC provides a platform of debate in all spheres of medieval research. Session and paper proposals are invited on all aspects of medieval studies, in any major European language.

Participants of the Congress range from senior scholars to postgraduate students, and interested members of the public such as members of the clergy or independent scholars. Every year, Congress delegates come from over 50 countries.

==Venue==
In 2013, the International Medieval Congress moved permanently to the University's main city centre campus, having previously been held at Bodington Hall, a site on the outskirts of Leeds. Because of the move, Congress delegates now have easier access to the University's modern facilities and accommodation, as well as access to the attractions of the city of Leeds.

==History==
The International Medieval Congress was first held in 1994 with a total participation of 849 delegates, in part to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the International Medieval Bibliography. The 1994 IMC took place at [[Bodington Hall]], a university hall of residence, and Weetwood Hall, a university-owned hotel and conference centre.

The 1994 Congress was held to commemorate the 1400th Anniversary of Gregory of Tours, although papers on all aspects of Medieval Studies were encouraged.

In following years, the Congress continued to include a special thematic focus in addition to papers on Medieval Studies in general. Often the theme is linked to a relevant anniversary. Thematic Strands to date are:

*1994: Gregory of Tours; commemorating the 1400th anniversary of the death of Gregory of Tours
*1995: Crusades; commemorating the 800th anniversary of the inception of the first Crusade (1095)
*1996: Warfare; celebrating the opening of the [[Royal Armouries Museum]] in Leeds
*1997: Conversion; commemorating the 1400th anniversary of the landing of St. Augustine in Kent in 597
*1998: Settlements; commemorating the 50th anniversary of the re-discovery of Wharram Percy through Maurice Beresford in 1948
*1999: Saints; aimed to promote interdisciplinary contacts between those working on all the different aspects of saints’ studies
*2000: Time and Eternity; commemorating the millennium in a wider context.
*2001: Familia and Domus
*2002: Exile; commemorating the 700th anniversary of the final expulsion of Dante from Florence
*2003: Power and Authority; marking to mark the 700th anniversary of Boniface VIII’s publication of the bull “Unam Sanctam”
*2004: Clash of Cultures, marking the 800th anniversary of the capture of Constantinople by the 4th Crusade
*2005 Youth and Age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1491588/Yobs-and-hoodies-a-medieval-scourge-too.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Yobs and hoodies a medieval scourge too | first=Paul | last=Stokes | date=8 June 2005 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/509/news.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years the Congress has grown to an average of well over 2000 participants each year. It has also become an important part of the medievalist calendar as it offers a European alternative to the [[International Congress on Medieval Studies]], which is held in [[Kalamazoo]], MI, USA.

==Academic Programme==
The core of the IMC is its academic programme. On average, there are over 600 sessions taking place throughout the IMC, with more than 40 running simultaneously.

Anyone is welcome to propose a session or paper. Papers and sessions are proposed online, with the submissions period beginning in May of the previous year. The deadlines for submissions remain the same each year; 31 August for paper proposals and 30 September for session proposals the year before the relevant Congress.

Organisers of sessions can be individuals or a group of colleagues (post-graduate students, independent scholars, university departments, societies etc.), or a named individual acting on behalf of an academic society, university department, research project, a museum, a journal or publisher, etc.

The IMC has an international Programming Committee made up of 35 scholars with differing specialties who assess all submissions. They then group individual papers into sessions based upon common themes, along with accepting sessions. All abstracts are included in the IMC’s online programme.

Participants are encouraged to organise session(s) with a balance of both young and established scholars, and with a geographical diversity, one or more being from mainland Europe. Each participant is only allowed to present one paper.

==Keynote Lectures==
There are usually 3-5 keynote lectures throughout the Congress, with the first one opening the Congress, and the others taking place in the evenings on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

==Events and Excursions==
In addition to the academic programme, the IMC features a large number of events and excursions open to the public run by experts in their field. This includes the Making Leeds Medieval event, which takes place on the final day of the Congress every year on the University of Leeds campus. Each Congress also offers concerts, drama performances and a variety of hands-on workshops. Participants of the Congress also organise an annual football match and this usually takes place on [[Woodhouse Moor]].

==Exhibitions and Fairs==
A book fair which features publishers that specialise in medieval studies runs from the Monday to the Thursday of the IMC. Many exhibitors offer special Congress discounts on their latest titles.

Since 2006 a two-day antiquarian and second-hand bookfair, has also been held which includes a number of smaller book dealers.

In recent years a one-day medieval craft fair has been held which includes replica crafts, in addition to crafts inspired by the Middle Ages. 

A one-day historical and archaeological societies’ fair is also held year on year which allows smaller, often local to the area, societies the opportunity to promote their work.

'''James Monroe Gregory''' (January 23, 1849 – December 17, 1915) was a Professor of Latin and Dean at Howard University. During the [[American Civil War]], he worked in Cleveland for the education and aid of escaped slaves. He initially attended [[Oberlin University]]. He transferred to Howard and was the valedictorian of Howard's first graduating class in 1872. He then became a member of faculty, where he served until the late 1880s. During that time he was active in civil rights, particularly related to the education of African American children. He fought to desegregate Washington DC schools in the early 1880s and participated in the [[Colored Conventions Movement]] and was a delegate to the [[1892 Republican National Convention]]. In 1890 he founded the American Association of Educators of Colored Youth. In 1893 he published a biography of [[Frederick Douglass]]. In 1897 he was removed at Howard and moved to New Jersey where he became principal of [[Bordentown School|Bordentown Industrial and Manual Training School]].

==Early life==
James Monroe Gregory was born in Lexington, Virginia on January 23, 1849 to Maria A. (Gladman) Gregory and Henry L., a local minister.&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt; During that year they moved to [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. In 1859 they moved to [[Cleveland, Ohio]] where James entered public schools. The family moved to [[La Porte, Indiana]] and then [[Chicago]], where James attended private and public schools respectively, before returning to Cleveland where he finished grammar school and entered high school. In 1865 he entered the preparatory department of [[Oberlin College]]. During his summer vacations, Gregory taught at Freedmen's Bureau schools in La Porte, in Mt. Tabor, Maryland, and in Lynchburg.&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, June.

GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p631-646&lt;/ref&gt; One of his teachers in Cleveland was [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller|Laura Spelman]].&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt; As his studies ended, he was recommended for a cadetship at [[West Point]] by General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]], but President [[Andrew Johnson]] refused to appoint him. While visiting Washington DC to get his appointment papers from Butler, he met General [[Oliver O. Howard]], who was impressed by Gregory and suggested that he (Howard) would like to work with him. Less than a year later, Howard had a letter sent to Gregory offering him a position of instructor in the preparatory department of [[Howard University]], and suggesting he finish his undergraduate studies at the same time at Howard, which Gregory accepted. While still in Ohio, Gregory worked to help escaped and freed slaves, and was secretary of the Fugitives Aid Society in Cleveland, later renamed the Freedmen's Aid Society in Cleveland.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; When Gregory started at Howard in September 1868, he was the first student in the collegiate department, which had two professors, [[Eliphalet Whittlesey]] and [[William F. Bascom]], and the course was based on classical studies of [[New England]] colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Logan 1969, p38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Howard University===
Gregory moved to [[Washington, DC]], and graduated first in a class of three from Howard in 1872 (the other two were [[A. C. O'Hear]] and [[Josiah T. Settle]]) and was made tutor of [[Latin]] and mathematics in the preparatory department,&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; where he was the only black teacher in the department.&lt;ref&gt;Logan 1969, p36&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of the next year he married Fannie E. Hagan of [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]], who had earlier been a student of his. Three years later he was appointed Professor of Latin in the college. In the 1880s, he was made Dean of the collegiate department.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; He received a master's degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1885.&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt;

===Civil Rights===
Gregory was a leading figure in Civil Rights movement in the 1880s. In 1881, Gregory began a fight for the right to send his children to public schools in Washington. In the course of the dispute, Gregory and [[George T. Downing]] discovered that a law before the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] creating separate schools for black children. The pair along with Charles Purvis created an organization to fight this discrimination. The group gathered about it many leading civil rights figures, having Frederick Douglass as president, [[Richard T. Greener]] as secretary, and also including [[Frederick G. Barbadoes]], John F. Cook, [[Francis James Grimké]], [[Milton M. Holland]], [[Wiley Lane]], [[William Henry Smith (American politician)|William H. Smith]], Purvis, Downing, and Gregory. The group was supported by representative [[Dudley C. Haskell]] of Kansas and succeeded. In 1883, after the [[Civil Rights Cases]] saw civil protections for African Americans overturned by the [[US Supreme Court]], Gregory was one of the organizers of mass meetings in protest which included Douglass, [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]], [[Samuel Shellabarger (congressman)|Samuel Shellaberger]], and [[Jeremiah Rankin]]. He was a leader of the 1883 National Convention of Colored Men in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where Gregory was elected temporary and then permanent secretary and fellow DC Delegate Frederick Douglass was made president.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; In 1893, Gregory published a biography of Frederick Douglass entitled, ''Frederick Douglass the Orator: Containing an Account of His Life; His Eminent Public Services; His Brilliant Career as Orator; Selections from His Speeches and Writings.''.

===Politics===
Gregory was also very active in politics. He was frequently mentioned for political appointments. He was secretary of the Republican Central Committee of the District of Columbia for four years in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; In 1881, he was endorsed by Oliver Howard, [[Blanche Kelso Bruce]], [[James Monroe (congressman)|James Monroe]], and [[John M. Brown]] to be appointed consul at [[Leeds, England]],&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline] National Republican (Washington, DC) May 11, 1881, page 1, accessed November 11, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7402069/no_headline_national_republican/&lt;/ref&gt; but did not receive the appointment. On February 27, 1886, Gregory was appointed to the board of trustees of [[District of Columbia Public Schools|public schools in Washington DC]] against vehement protest of Democrats and the conservative press, and the next year was made chairman of the committee on teachers and janitors by the board president.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; He served on the board for six years.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory 1893, p6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887 he was a candidate to replace [[James Campbell Matthews]] as Washington, DC [[Recorder of Deeds]], although the position went to [[William Monroe Trotter]].&lt;ref&gt;Our Weekly Review, The Washington Bee (Washington, DC) March 5, 1887, page 4, accessed November 11, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7402176/our_weekly_review_the_washington_bee/&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was again a candidate for the position to succeed Trotter in late 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Items on the Wing, The Cinicinatti Enquirer (Cincinnati, Ohio) November 23, 1889, page 16, accessed November 11, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7402290/items_on_the_wing_the_cinicinatti/&lt;/ref&gt; but the position went to Blanche Bruce. Gregory was president of the American Association of Educators of Colored Youth which was he founded in 1890&lt;ref&gt;An Educational Association, Richmond Planet (Richmond, Virginia) December 27, 1890, page 5, accessed November 11, 2016, at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7402365/an_educational_association_richmond/&lt;/ref&gt; and led throughout its existence.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; He was a delegate to the 1892 Republican National Convention, and expressed interest in the Recorder of Deeds job again, which in 1893 went to [[C. H. J. Taylor]].&lt;ref name="dropped"&gt;Dropped the Professor, Washington Times (Washington, DC) September 26, 1895, page 1, accessed November 11, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7402567/dropped_the_professor_washington_times/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal from Howard and principalship in Bordentown===
In 1891, Gregory was in debt and was accused by [[Daniel Alexander Payne Murray|Daniel Murray]] and a group of other individuals of inappropriate financial dealings with his students, but the charges were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Gregory Vindicated, The Washington Bee (Washington, DC) June 13, 1891, page 2, accessed November 11, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7402481/prof_gregory_vindicated_the/&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations resurfaced in 1895, and Gregory was removed as professor at Howard by the board led by University president [[Jeremiah Rankin]], although the move was opposed by black members of the board. Gregory was, at the time, the senior professor of the institution, and the institution was itself in debt, which was used as a reason for the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;James Monroe Gregory, The Washington Bee (Washington, DC) September 7, 1895, page 1, accessed November 11, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7402520/james_monroe_gregory_the_washington/&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory appealed, and his cause was widely supported by students and alumni, but his dismissal was upheld.&lt;ref name="dropped"/&gt; Gregory sued Murray for libel related to the case, which Gregory withdrew when Murray retracted claims he made.&lt;ref&gt;Made a Retraction, Evening Star (Washington, DC) March 30, 1897, page 3, accessed November 11, 2016 at Made a Retraction, Evening Star (Washington, DC) March 30, 1897, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, he became principal of the Bordentown Industrial and Manual Training School in [[Bordentown, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortune, T. Thomas. After War Times: An African American Childhood in Reconstruction-era Florida. University of Alabama Press, 2014. p97&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was very successful in this role, and the school grew in enrollment and in quality of facilities during his tenure. The school was based on the methods [[Booker T. Washington]] advocated and applied at the [[Tuskegee Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;School of Great Promise, The New York Age (New York, New York) September 21, 1905, page 2, accessed November 11, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7402868/school_of_great_promise_the_new_york/&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory served until February, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;J.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|history}}

'''Jewish history''' is the history of the [[Jews]], and their [[Judaism|religion]] and [[Jewish culture|culture]], as it developed and interacted with other peoples, religions and cultures. Although Judaism as a religion first appears in Greek records during the [[Hellenistic period]] (323 BCE – 31 BCE) and the earliest mention of [[Israelites|Israel]] is inscribed on the [[Merneptah Stele]] dated 1213–1203 BCE, religious literature tells the story of Israelites going back at least as far as c. 1500 BCE. The [[Jewish diaspora]] began with the [[Assyrian captivity]] and continued on a much larger scale with the [[Babylonian captivity]]. Jews were also widespread throughout the [[Roman Empire]], and this carried on to a lesser extent in the period of [[Byzantine  Empire|Byzantine]] rule in the central and eastern [[Mediterranean]]. In 638 CE the Byzantine Empire lost control of the Levant. The Arab [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] under [[Caliph Omar]] conquered [[Jerusalem]] and the lands of [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Syria|Syria]], Palestine and Egypt. The [[Golden Age of Jewish culture in Spain]] coincided with the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, a period of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] throughout much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. During that time, Jews were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed.

During the Classical Ottoman period (1300–1600), the Jews, together with most other communities of the empire, enjoyed a certain level of prosperity. In the 17th century, there were many significant Jewish populations in Western Europe. During the period of the [[European Renaissance]] and Enlightenment, significant changes occurred within the Jewish community. Jews began in the 18th century to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society. During the 1870s and 1880s the Jewish population in Europe began to more actively discuss emigration back to Israel and the re-establishment of the Jewish Nation in its national homeland. The Zionist movement was founded officially in 1897. Meanwhile, the Jews of Europe and the United States gained success in the fields of science, culture and the economy. Among those generally considered the most famous were scientist [[Albert Einstein]] and philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. A large number of [[Nobel Prize]] winners at this time were Jewish, as is still the case.&lt;ref name="Jewish Nobel Prize Winners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Nobel_Prizes.html|title=Jewish Nobel Prize Winners|publisher=jinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, with the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in Germany, the Jewish situation became more severe. Economic crises, racial anti-Semitic laws, and a fear of an upcoming war led many Jews to flee from Europe to Palestine, to the United States and to the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1939 [[World War II]] began and until 1941 Hitler occupied almost all of Europe, including Poland—where millions of Jews were living at that time—and France. In 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union, the [[Final Solution]] began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in political Europe, inclusive of European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). This [[genocide]], in which approximately six million Jews were methodically exterminated, is known as [[The Holocaust]] or ''Shoah'' (Hebrew term). In Poland, three million Jews were killed in [[gas chambers]] in all concentration camps combined, with one million at the [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp alone.

In 1945 the Jewish resistance organizations in Palestine unified and established the Jewish Resistance Movement, which attacked the British authorities. David Ben-Gurion proclaimed on May 14, 1948, the establishment of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]] to be known as the [[State of Israel]]. Immediately afterwards all neighbouring Arab states attacked, yet the newly formed IDF resisted. In 1949 the war ended and the state of Israel started building the state and absorbing massive waves of hundreds of thousands of Jews from all over the world. Today (2018), [[Israel]] is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with a population of over 8 million people, of whom about 6 million are [[Israeli Jews|Jewish]]. The largest Jewish communities are in Israel and the [[American Jews|United States]], with major communities in France, Argentina, Russia, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and [[History of the Jews in Germany|Germany]]. For statistics related to modern Jewish demographics see ''[[Jewish population]]''.

==Time periods in Jewish history==
The history of the Jews and Judaism can be divided into five periods: (1) ancient Israel before Judaism, from the beginnings to 586 BCE; (2) the beginning of Judaism in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE;{{what|reason=This looks like accidentally poor wording. As written, the entirety of the Second Temple period is left out of this timeline.|date=June 2017}} (3) the formation of [[rabbinic Judaism]] after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE; (4) the age of rabbinic Judaism, from the ascension of [[Christianity]] to political power under the [[emperor Constantine the Great]] in 312 CE to the end of the political hegemony of Christianity in the 18th century; and (5), the age of diverse Judaisms, from the French and American Revolutions to the present.{{sfn|Neusner|1992|p=4}}

The history of the early Jews, and their neighbors, centers on the [[Fertile Crescent]] and east coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It begins among those people who occupied the area lying between the river [[Nile]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Surrounded by ancient seats of culture in [[Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]], by the deserts of [[Arabia]], and by the highlands of [[Asia Minor]], the land of [[Canaan]] (roughly corresponding to modern Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Jordan and Lebanon) was a meeting place of civilizations.

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], Jews descend from the [[Israelites|ancient people of Israel]] who settled in the land of Canaan between the eastern coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Jordan River]]. The Hebrew Bible refers to the "Children of Israel" as Israelite descendants of a common ancestor [[Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/children-of-israel/&lt;/ref&gt; It also suggests that the nomadic travels of the [[Hebrews]] centered on [[Hebron]] in the first centuries of the second millennium BCE, leading to the establishment of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] as their burial site in Hebron. The Children of Israel, in this account, consisted of twelve tribes, each descended from one of Jacob's twelve sons, [[Reuven]], [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Shimon]], [[Levi]], [[Judah (Bible)|Yehuda]], [[Yissachar]], [[Zevulun]], [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]], [[Naftali]], [[Asher]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Yosef]], and [[Benjamin|Benyamin]].

[[File:Figurine from Egypt of semitic slave (2).jpg|thumb|A Semitic slave. Ancient Egyptian figurine. [[Hecht Museum]]]]
The Book of Genesis, chapters 25–50, tells the story of Jacob and his twelve sons, who left Canaan during a severe famine and settled in [[Land of Goshen|Goshen]] of northern Egypt. The Egyptian [[Pharaonic Egypt|Pharaonic]] government allegedly enslaved their descendants, although there is no independent evidence of this having occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Were Jews ever really slaves in Egypt, or is Passover a myth?|url= http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/were-jews-ever-really-slaves-in-egypt-or-is-passover-a-myth-1.420844|work= Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some 400 years of slavery, [[YHWH]], the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]], sent the Hebrew prophet [[Moses]] of the tribe of Levi to release the Israelites from bondage. According to the Bible, the Hebrews miraculously emigrated out of [[Egypt]] (an event known as [[the Exodus]]), and returned to their ancestral homeland in Canaan. According to the Bible, after their emancipation from Egyptian slavery, the people of Israel wandered around and lived in the [[Sinai desert]] for a span of forty years before conquering Canaan in 1400 BCE under the command of [[Joshua]]. While living in the desert, according to the Biblical writings, the nation of Israel received the [[Ten Commandments]] at [[Mount Sinai]] from [[YHWH]] via Moses. After entering Canaan, portions of the land were given to each of the twelve tribes of Israel.

However, archaeology reveals a different story of the origins of the Jewish people: they did not necessarily leave the Levant.

[...] Israel is first textually attested as a political entity in Egyptian texts of the late 13th century BC and the Egyptologist Donald Redford argues that the Israelites must have been emerging as a distinct group within the Canaanite culture during the century or so prior to this. It has been suggested that the early Israelites were an oppressed rural group of Canaanites who rebelled against the more urbanized coastal Canaanites (Gottwald 1979). Alternatively, it has been argued that the Israelites were survivors of the decline in the fortunes of Canaan who established themselves in the highlands at the end of the late Bronze Age (Ahlstrom 1986: 27). Redford, however, makes a good case for equating the very earliest Israelites with a semi-nomadic people in the highlands of central Palestine whom the Egyptians called Shasu (Redford 1992:2689-80; although see Stager 1985 for strong arguments against the identification with the Shasu). These Shasu were a persistent thorn in the side of the Ramessid pharoahs' empire in Syria-Palestine, well-attested in Egytian texts, but their pastoral lifestyle has left scant traces in the archaeological record. By the end of the 13th century BC, however, the Shasu/Israelites were beginning to establish small settlements in the uplands, the architecture of which closely resembles contemporary Canaanite villages.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult-objects are those of the Canaanite god [[El (deity)|El]], the pottery remains in the local Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet used is early Canaanite. Almost the sole marker distinguishing the "Israelite" villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones, although whether this can be taken as an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Biblical Peoples and Ethnicity: An Archeological Study of Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, and Early Israel, 1300–1100 B.C.E. |last= Killebrew |first= Ann E. |year= 2005 |publisher= Society of Biblical Literature |location= Atlanta |isbn= 978-1-58983-097-4 |page= 176 |accessdate= August 12, 2012 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VtAmmwapfVAC | quote = Much has been made of the scarcity of pig bones at highland sites. Since small quantities of pig bones do appear in Late Bronze Age assemblages, some archaeologists have interpreted this to indicate that the ethnic identity of the highland inhabitants was distinct from Late Bronze Age indigenous peoples (see Finkelstein 1997, 227-30). Brian Hesse and Paula Wapnish (1997) advise caution, however, since the lack of pig bones at Iron I highland settlements could be a result of other factors that have little to do with ethnicity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several hundred years, the [[Land of Israel]] was organized into a confederacy of twelve tribes ruled by a series of [[Biblical judges|Judges]]. After that came the Israelite monarchy, established in 1000 BCE under [[Saul the King|Saul]], and continued under King [[David]] and his son, [[Solomon]]. During the reign of David, the already existing city of [[Jerusalem]] became the national and spiritual capital of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel and Judah]]. Solomon built the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] on [[Mount Moriah]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;

|quote = The rule of Israelites in the land of Israel starts with the conquests of Joshua (ca. 1250 BCE). The period from 1000-587 BCE is known as the 'Period of the Kings'. The most noteworthy kings were King David (1010-970 BCE), who made Jerusalem the Capital of Israel, and his son Solomon (Shlomo, 970-931 BCE), who built the first Temple in Jerusalem as prescribed in the Tanach (Old Testament).

However, the tribes were fracturing politically. Upon his death, a civil war erupted between the ten northern Israelite tribes, and the tribes of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] ([[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] was absorbed into Judah) and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] in the south. The nation split into the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the north, and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] in the south. The [[Assyria]]n ruler [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] conquered the northern kingdom of Israel in the 8th century BCE. No commonly accepted historical record accounts for the ultimate fate of the ten northern tribes, sometimes referred to as the [[Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]], although speculation abounds.

After the death of the last Jewish prophet and while still under Persian rule, the leadership of the [[Jewish people]] passed into the hands of five successive generations of [[zugot]] ("pairs of") leaders. They flourished first [[Yehud Medinata|under the Persians]] and then under the Greeks. As a result, the [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]] were formed.

In 332 BCE, the Persians were defeated by [[Alexander the Great]] of [[Macedon]]. After his demise, and the division of Alexander's empire among his generals, the [[Seleucid Kingdom]] was formed.

Greek culture was spread eastwards by the Alexandrian conquests. The Levant was not immune to this cultural spread. During this time, currents of Judaism were influenced by [[Hellenistic philosophy]] developed from the 3rd century BCE, notably the [[Jewish diaspora]] in [[Alexandria]], culminating in the compilation of the [[Septuagint]]. An important advocate of the symbiosis of Jewish theology and Hellenistic thought is [[Philo]].

===The Hasmonean Kingdom (110–63 BCE)===
{{Main article|Hasmonean dynasty}}
A deterioration of relations between hellenized Jews and orthodox Jews led the Seleucid king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] to impose decrees banning certain [[Judaism|Jewish religious rites and traditions]]. Consequently, the orthodox Jews revolted under the leadership of the [[Hasmonean]] family (also known as the [[Maccabees]]). This revolt eventually led to the formation of an independent Jewish kingdom, known as the [[Hasmonaean Dynasty]], which lasted from 165 BCE to 63 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Judea had been an independent Jewish kingdom under the [[Hasmonean]]s, but was [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|conquered by the Roman general Pompey in 63 BCE]] and reorganized as a client state. [[Roman expansion]] was going on in other areas as well, and would continue for more than a hundred and fifty years. Later, [[Herod the Great]] was appointed "King of the Jews" by the [[Roman Senate]], supplanting the Hasmonean dynasty. Some of his offspring held various positions after him, known as the [[Herodian dynasty]]. Briefly, from 4 BCE to 6 CE, [[Herod Archelaus]] ruled the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarchy of Judea]] as [[ethnarch]], the Romans denying him the title of King. After the [[Census of Quirinius]] in 6 CE, the [[Judaea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judaea]] was formed as a satellite of [[Roman Syria]] under the rule of a [[prefect]] (as was [[Roman Egypt]]) until 41 CE, then [[Procurator (Roman)|procurators]] after 44 CE. The empire was often callous and brutal in its treatment of its Jewish subjects, (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire]]). In 30 CE (or 33 CE), [[Jesus of Nazareth]], an itinerant [[rabbi]] from [[Galilee]], and the central figure of [[Christianity]], was put to death by [[crucifixion]] in Jerusalem under the Roman prefect of [[Judaea]], [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, James H. (2008). The Historical Jesus: An Essential Guide. {{ISBN|9781426724756}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 66 CE, the Jews began to revolt against the Roman rulers of Judea. The revolt was defeated by the future Roman emperors [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]]. In the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, the Romans destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem and, according to some accounts, plundered artifacts from the temple, such as the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]. Jews continued to live in their land in significant numbers, the [[Kitos War]] of 115–117 CE nothwithstanding, until [[Sextus Julius Severus|Julius Severus]] ravaged Judea while putting down the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] of 132–136 CE. 985 villages were destroyed and most of the Jewish population of central Judaea was essentially wiped out, killed, sold into slavery, or forced to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Banished from Jerusalem, except for the day of [[Tisha B'Av]], the Jewish population now centred on [[Galilee]] and initially in [[Yavne]]. Jerusalem was renamed [[Aelia Capitolina]] and Judea was renamed [[Syria Palestina]], to spite the Jews by naming it after their ancient enemies, the [[Philistines]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Jews were only allowed to visit Aelia Capitolina on the day of [[Tisha B'Av]].

===The diaspora===
{{Main article|Jewish diaspora}}
The Jewish diaspora began with the Assyrian conquest and continued on a much larger scale with the Babylonian conquest, in which the Tribe of Judah was exiled to Babylonia along with the dethroned King of Judah, [[Jehoiachin]], in the 6th century BCE, and was taken into captivity in 597 BCE. The exile continued after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 586 BCE.&lt;ref name="Translation 1981, pg. 95"&gt;[מרדכי וורמברנד ובצלאל ס רותת "עם ישראל - תולדות 4000 שנה - מימי האבות ועד חוזה השלום", ע"מ 95. (Translation: Mordechai Vermebrand and Betzalel S. Ruth - "The People of Israel - the history of 4000 years - from the days of the Forefathers to the Peace Treaty", 1981, pg. 95)&lt;/ref&gt; Many more Jews migrated to Babylon in 135 CE after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] and in the centuries after.&lt;ref name="Translation 1981, pg. 95"/&gt;

Many of the Judaean Jews were sold into [[slavery]] while others became citizens of other parts of the [[Roman Empire]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] in the [[New Testament]], as well as other [[Pauline epistles|Pauline]] texts, make frequent reference to the large populations of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenised Jews]] in the cities of the Roman world. These Hellenised Jews were affected by the [[diaspora]] only in its spiritual sense, absorbing the feeling of loss and homelessness that became a cornerstone of the Jewish creed, much supported by persecutions in various parts of the world. The policy encouraging [[proselytism]] and conversion to Judaism, which spread the Jewish religion throughout the [[Hellenistic civilization]], seems to have subsided with the wars against the Romans.

Of critical importance to the reshaping of Jewish tradition from the Temple-based religion to the rabbinic traditions of the Diaspora, was the development of the interpretations of the Torah found in the ''[[Mishnah]]'' and ''[[Talmud]].''

===Late Roman period in the Land of Israel===

The relations of the Jews with the Roman Empire in the region continued to be complicated. [[Constantine the Great and Judaism|Constantine I]] allowed Jews to mourn their defeat and humiliation once a year on [[Tisha B'Av]] at the [[Western Wall]]. In 351–352 CE, the Jews of Galilee launched [[Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus|yet another revolt]], provoking heavy retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lazare and Robert Wistrich, Antisemitism: Its History and Causes, University of Nebraska Press, 1995, I, pp.46-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallus revolt came during the rising influence of early Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire, under the [[Constantinian dynasty]]. In 355, however, the relations with the Roman rulers improved, upon the rise of Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], the last of the Constantinian dynasty, who unlike his predecessors defied Christianity. In 363, not long before Julian left Antioch to launch his campaign against Sasanian Persia, in keeping with his effort to foster religions other than Christianity, he ordered the Jewish Temple rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 23.1.2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure to rebuild the Temple has mostly been ascribed to the dramatic [[Galilee earthquake of 363]] and traditionally also to the Jews' ambivalence about the project. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire. Divine intervention was the common view among Christian historians of the time.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;See [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/julian-jews.html "Julian and the Jews 361–363 CE"] (Fordham University, The Jesuit University of New York) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20051020130904/http://www.gibsoncondo.com/~david/convert/history.html "Julian the Apostate and the Holy Temple"].&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's support of Jews caused Jews to call him "Julian the [[Hellenes (religion)|Hellene]]".&lt;ref&gt;A Psychoanalytic History of the Jews, [[Avner Falk]]&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's fatal wound in the Persian campaign and his consequent death had put an end to Jewish aspirations, and Julian's successors embraced Christianity through the entire timeline of Byzantine rule of Jerusalem, preventing any Jewish claims.

In 438 CE, when the Empress [[Licinia Eudoxia|Eudocia]] removed the ban on Jews' praying at the [[Temple Mount|Temple site]], the heads of the Community in Galilee issued a call "to the great and mighty people of the Jews" which began: "Know that the end of the exile of our people has come!" However, the Christian population of the city, who saw this as a threat to their primacy, didn't allow it and a riot erupted after which they chased away the Jews from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Avraham Yaari, ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' (Tel Aviv, 1943), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew S. Jacobs|title=Remains of the Jews: The Holy Land and Christian Empire in Late Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8O95ErDSZQgC&amp;pg=PA157|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4705-9|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 5th and the 6th centuries, a series of [[Samaritan Revolts|Samaritan insurrections]] broke out across the [[Palaestina Prima]] province. Especially violent were the third and the fourth revolts, which resulted in almost the entire annihilation of the Samaritan community. It is likely that the Samaritan [[Samaritan Revolts|Revolt of 556]] was joined by the Jewish community, which had also suffered a brutal suppression of Israelite religion.

In the belief of restoration to come, in the early 7th century the Jews made an [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius|alliance]] with the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]], who invaded Palaestina Prima in 614, fought at their side, overwhelmed the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] garrison in Jerusalem, and were given Jerusalem to be governed as an autonomy.&lt;ref name = "Phoenicia"&gt;{{cite book |title= Itineraria Phoenicia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA542&amp;dq=Opusculum+de+Persica+captivitate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IzofU5aPGIfiqAGVoIHwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Opusculum%20de%20Persica%20captivitate&amp;f=false| author = Edward Lipiński |publisher = Peeters Publishers |pages = 542–543 |year = 2004 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their autonomy was brief: the [[Nehemiah ben Hushiel|Jewish leader]] in Jerusalem was shortly assassinated during a Christian revolt and though Jerusalem was reconquered by Persians and Jews within 3 weeks, it fell into anarchy. With the consequent withdrawal of Persian forces, Jews surrendered to Byzantines in 625 or 628 CE, but were massacred by Christian radicals in 629 CE, with the survivors fleeing to Egypt. The Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire) control of the region was finally lost to the Muslim Arab armies in 637 CE, when [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] completed the conquest of Akko.

===Jews of Babylonia (219–1250 CE)===
{{Main article|History of the Jews in Iraq}}
After the fall of Jerusalem, [[Babylonia]] (modern day Iraq), would become the focus of Judaism for more than a thousand years. The first Jewish communities in Babylonia started with the exile of the Tribe of Judah to Babylon by [[Jehoiachin]] in 597 BCE as well as after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 586 BCE.&lt;ref name="Translation 1981, pg. 95"/&gt; Many more Jews migrated to Babylon in 135 CE after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] and in the centuries after.&lt;ref name="Translation 1981, pg. 95"/&gt; Babylonia, where some of the largest and most prominent Jewish cities and communities were established, became the center of Jewish life all the way up to the 13th century. By the first century, Babylonia already held a speedily growing&lt;ref name="Translation 1981, pg. 95"/&gt; population of an estimated 1,000,000 Jews, which increased to an estimated 2 million&lt;ref name="Solomon Gryazel p. 137"/&gt; between the years 200 CE and 500 CE, both by natural growth and by immigration of more Jews from the Land of Israel, making up about 1/6 of the world Jewish population at that era.&lt;ref name="Solomon Gryazel p. 137"/&gt; It was there that they would write the Babylonian [[Talmud]] in the languages used by the Jews of ancient Babylonia: [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]]. The Jews established [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], also known as the Geonic Academies ("Geonim" meaning "splendour" in Biblical Hebrew or "geniuses"), which became the center for Jewish scholarship and the development of Jewish law in Babylonia from roughly 500 CE to 1038 CE. The two most famous academies were the [[Pumbedita Academy]] and the [[Sura Academy]]. Major yeshivot were also located at [[Nehardea]] and Mahuza. The Talmudic [[Yeshiva]] Academies became a main part of Jewish culture and education, and Jews continued on establishing Yeshiva Academies in Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa, and in the centuries later on to America and other countries around the world where Jews lived in the Diaspora. Talmudic study in [[Yeshiva]] academies continue today with the establishment of a large number of Yeshiva academies, most of them located in The United States and [[State of Israel|Israel]].

These Talmudic [[Yeshiva]] academies of Babylonia followed the era of the [[Amoraim]] ("expounders")—the sages of the Talmud who were active (both in the [[Land of Israel]] and in Babylon) during the end of the era of the sealing of the [[Mishnah]] and until the times of the sealing of the Talmud (220CE – 500CE), and following the [[Savoraim]] ("reasoners")—the sages of Beth midrash (Torah study places) in Babylon from the end of the era of the Amoraim (5th century) and until the beginning of the era of the [[Geonim]]. The Geonim (Hebrew: גאונים) were the presidents of the two great rabbinical colleges of Sura and Pumbedita, and were the generally accepted spiritual leaders of the worldwide Jewish community in the early medieval era, in contrast to the [[Resh Galuta]] (Exilarch) who wielded secular authority over the Jews in Islamic lands. According to traditions, the [[Resh Galuta]] were descendants of Judean kings, which is why the kings of [[Parthia]] would treat them with much honour.&lt;ref&gt;[מרדכי וורמברנד ובצלאל ס. רותת "עם ישראל - תולדות 4000 שנה - מימי האבות ועד חוזה השלום", ע"מ 97. (Translation: Mordechai Vermebrand and Betzalel S. Ruth ''The People of Israel: The History of 4,000 Years, from the Days of the Forefathers to the Peace Treaty'', 1981, p. 97)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Jews of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the yeshivot of Babylonia served much the same function as the ancient [[Sanhedrin]]. That is, as a council of Jewish religious authorities. The academies were founded in pre-Islamic Babylonia under the Zoroastrian Sassanid dynasty and were located not far from the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, which at that time was the largest city in the world. After the conquest of Persia in the 7th century, the academies subsequently operated for four hundred years under the Islamic caliphate. The first gaon of Sura, according to [[Sherira Gaon]], was Mar bar Rab Chanan, who assumed office in 609. The last gaon of [[Sura]] was [[Samuel ben Hofni]], who died in 1034; the last gaon of Pumbedita was [[Hezekiah Gaon]], who was tortured to death in 1040; hence the activity of the Geonim covers a period of nearly 450 years.

One of principal seats of Babylonian Judaism was [[Nehardea]], which was then a very large city made up mostly of Jews.&lt;ref name="Translation 1981, pg. 95"/&gt; A very ancient synagogue, built, it was believed, by King Jehoiachin, existed in Nehardea. At Huzal, near Nehardea, there was another synagogue, not far from which could be seen the ruins of Ezra's academy. In the period before Hadrian, Akiba, on his arrival at Nehardea on a mission from the Sanhedrin, entered into a discussion with a resident scholar on a point of matrimonial law (Mishnah Yeb., end). At the same time there was at Nisibis (northern [[Mesopotamia]]), an excelling Jewish college, at the head of which stood Judah ben Bathyra, and in which many Judean scholars found refuge at the time of the persecutions. A certain temporary importance was also attained by a school at Nehar-Peḳod, founded by the Judean immigrant Hananiah, nephew of [[Joshua ben Hananiah]], which school might have been the cause of a schism between the Jews of Babylonia and those of Judea-Israel, had not the Judean authorities promptly checked Hananiah's ambition.

===Byzantine period (324–638 CE)===
{{Main article|Jews of Byzantium}}
Jews were also widespread throughout the Roman Empire, and this carried on to a lesser extent in the period of Byzantine rule in the central and eastern Mediterranean. The militant and exclusive Christianity and [[caesaropapism]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] did not treat Jews well, and the condition and influence of diaspora Jews in the Empire declined dramatically.

It was official Christian policy to convert Jews to [[Christianity]], and the Christian leadership used the official power of Rome in their attempts. In 351 CE the Jews revolted against the added pressures of their Governor, [[Constantius Gallus]]. Gallus put down the revolt and destroyed the major cities in the Galilee area where the revolt had started. Tzippori and Lydda (site of two of the major legal academies) never recovered.

In this period, the Nasi in Tiberias, Hillel II, created an official calendar, which needed no monthly sightings of the moon. The months were set, and the calendar needed no further authority from Judea. At about the same time, the Jewish academy at Tiberius began to collate the combined Mishnah, [[braitot]], explanations, and interpretations developed by generations of scholars who studied after the death of [[Judah HaNasi]]. The text was organized according to the order of the Mishna: each paragraph of Mishnah was followed by a compilation of all of the interpretations, stories, and responses associated with that Mishnah. This text is called the ''[[Jerusalem Talmud]].''

The Jews of Judea received a brief respite from official persecution during the rule of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. Julian's policy was to return the kingdom to Hellenism and he encouraged the Jews to rebuild Jerusalem. As Julian's rule lasted briefly from 361 to 363, the Jews could not rebuild sufficiently before Roman Christian rule was restored over the Empire. Beginning in 398 with the consecration of [[St. John Chrysostom]] as [[Patriarch]], the Christian rhetoric against Jews continued to rise; he preached sermons with titles such as "Against the Jews" and "On the Statues, Homily 17," in which John preaches against "the Jewish sickness".&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Mayer and [[Pauline Allen]], ''John Chrysostom: The Early Church Fathers'' (London, 2000), p. 113, 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Such heated language contributed to a climate of Christian distrust and hate toward the large Jewish settlements, such as those in [[Antioch]] and [[Constantinople]].

In the beginning of the 5th century, the [[Emperor Theodosius]] issued a set of decrees establishing official persecution against Jews. Jews were not allowed to own slaves, build new synagogues, hold public office or try cases between a Jew and a non-Jew. Intermarriage between Jew and non-Jew was made a capital offense, as was a Christian converting to Judaism. Theodosius did away with the [[Sanhedrin]] and abolished the post of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]. Under the [[Emperor Justinian]], the authorities further restricted the civil rights of Jews,&lt;ref&gt;Cod., I., v. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and threatened their religious privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Historia Arcana'', 28&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor interfered in the internal affairs of the synagogue,&lt;ref&gt;Nov., cxlvi., Feb. 8, 553&lt;/ref&gt; and forbade, for instance, the use of the Hebrew language in divine worship. Those who disobeyed the restrictions were threatened with corporal penalties, exile, and loss of property. The Jews at Borium, not far from Syrtis Major, who resisted the Byzantine General [[Belisarius]] in his campaign against the [[Vandals]], were forced to embrace Christianity, and their synagogue was converted to a church.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''De Aedificiis'', vi. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian and his successors had concerns outside the province of Judea, and he had insufficient troops to enforce these regulations. As a result, the 5th century was a period when a wave of new synagogues were built, many with beautiful mosaic floors. Jews adopted the rich art forms of the Byzantine culture. Jewish mosaics of the period portray people, animals, menorahs, zodiacs, and Biblical characters. Excellent examples of these synagogue floors have been found at Beit Alpha (which includes the scene of Abraham sacrificing a ram instead of his son Isaac along with a zodiac), Tiberius, Beit Shean, and Tzippori.

The precarious existence of Jews under Byzantine rule did not long endure, largely for the explosion of the Muslim religion out of the remote Arabian peninsula (where large populations of Jews resided, see [[History of the Jews under Muslim Rule]] for more). The [[Muslim]] [[Caliphate]] ejected the Byzantines from the Holy Land (or the [[Levant]], defined as modern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) within a few years of their victory at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636. Numerous Jews fled the remaining Byzantine territories in favour of residence in the Caliphate over the subsequent centuries.

The size of the Jewish community in the Byzantine Empire was not affected by attempts by some emperors (most notably Justinian) to forcibly convert the Jews of Anatolia to Christianity, as these attempts met with very little success.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Alexandrovič Ostrogorsky|G. Ostrogorsky]], ''History of the Byzantine State''&lt;/ref&gt; Historians continue to research the status of the Jews in Asian Minor during the Byzantine rule. (for a sample of views, see, for instance, J. Starr ''The Jews in the Byzantine Empire, 641–1204''; S. Bowman, ''The Jews of Byzantium''; R. Jenkins ''Byzantium''; Averil Cameron, "Byzantines and Jews: Recent Work on Early Byzantium", ''Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies'' 20 (1996)). No systematic persecution of the type endemic at that time in Western Europe (pogroms, the stake, mass expulsions, etc.) has been recorded in Byzantium.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Byzantium'', C. Mango (Ed) (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Jewish population of [[Constantinople]] remained in place after the conquest of the city by [[Mehmet II]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Perhaps in the 4th century, the [[Kingdom of Semien]], a Jewish nation in modern [[Beta Israel|Ethiopia]] was established, lasting until the 17th century{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

===Islamic period (638–1099)===
{{Main article|History of the Jews under Muslim rule}}
In 638 CE the Byzantine Empire lost control of the Levant. The Arab [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] under [[Caliph Omar]] conquered Jerusalem and the lands of [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Syria|Syria]], Palestine and Egypt. As a political system, Islam created radically new conditions for Jewish economic, social, and intellectual development.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Mark.

ABC-CLIO, 2009, p. 152.({{ISBN|9781851098736}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caliph Omar]] permitted the Jews to reestablish their presence in Jerusalem–after a lapse of 500 years.&lt;ref name="Bashan, Eliezer 2007"&gt;Bashan, Eliezer.

According to the Arab geographer [[Al-Muqaddasi]], the Jews worked as "the assayers of coins, the dyers, the tanners and the bankers in the community".&lt;ref name=SKatz/&gt; During the [[Fatimid]] period, many Jewish officials served in the regime.&lt;ref name=SKatz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eretzyisroel.org/~samuel/presence.html |title=Continuous Jewish Presence in the Holy Land |author=Joseph E.

During this time Jews lived in thriving communities all across ancient Babylonia. In the Geonic period (650–1250 CE), the Babylonian Yeshiva Academies were the chief centers of Jewish learning; the Geonim (meaning either "Splendor" or "Geniuses"), who were the heads of these schools, were recognized as the highest authorities in Jewish law.

===Jewish Golden Age in early Muslim Spain (711–1031)===
{{main article|Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain}}
The Golden Age of Jewish culture in Spain coincided with the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, a period of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] throughout much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. During that time, [[Jews]] were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed.

A period of tolerance thus dawned for the Jews of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest. Especially after 912, during the reign of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] and his son, [[Al-Hakam II]], the Jews prospered, devoting themselves to the service of the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]], to the study of the sciences, and to commerce and industry, especially to trading in silk and slaves, in this way promoting the prosperity of the country. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the [[Romance languages]], as well as translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic. Jews also contributed to botany, geography, medicine, mathematics, poetry and philosophy.&lt;ref name="weiner"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim] by Rebecca Weiner.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Generally, the Jewish people were allowed to practice their religion and live according to the laws and scriptures of their community. Furthermore, the restrictions to which they were subject were social and symbolic rather than tangible and practical in character. That is to say, these regulations served to define the relationship between the two communities, and not to oppress the Jewish population.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;Lewis, Bernard W (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

'Abd al-Rahman's court physician and minister was Hasdai ben Isaac ibn Shaprut, the patron of Menahem ben Saruq, Dunash ben Labrat, and other Jewish scholars and poets. Jewish thought during this period flourished under famous figures such as Samuel Ha-Nagid, Moses ibn Ezra, Solomon ibn Gabirol [[Judah Halevi]] and [[Moses Maimonides]].&lt;ref name="weiner" /&gt; During 'Abd al-Rahman's term of power, the scholar [[Moses ben Hanoch|Moses ben Enoch]] was appointed [[rabbi]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and as a consequence [[al-Andalus]] became the center of [[Talmud]]ic study, and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] the meeting-place of Jewish savants.

The Golden Age ended with the invasion of al-Andalus by the [[Almohades]], a conservative dynasty originating in North Africa, who were highly intolerant of religious minorities.

===Crusaders period (1099–1260)===
{{Main article|History of the Jews and the Crusades}}
{{See also|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)}}
[[File:1099jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|[[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Capture of Jerusalem]], 1099]]
Sermonical messages to avenge the death of Jesus encouraged Christians to participate in the Crusades. The twelfth century Jewish narration from R. Solomon ben Samson records that crusaders en route to the Holy Land decided that before combating the Ishmaelites they would massacre the Jews residing in their midst to avenge the [[crucifixion of Christ]]. The massacres began at [[Rouen]] and Jewish communities in [[Rhine Valley]] were seriously affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Malamat|title=A History of the Jewish People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&amp;pg=PA413|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39731-6|pages=413–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crusading attacks were made upon Jews in the territory around Heidelberg. A huge loss of Jewish life took place. Many were forcibly converted to Christianity and many committed suicide to avoid baptism. A major driving factor behind the choice to commit suicide was the Jewish realisation that upon being slain their children could be taken to be raised as Christians. The Jews were living in the middle of Christian lands and felt this danger acutely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Malamat|title=A History of the Jewish People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&amp;pg=PA413|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39731-6|pages=416–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This massacre is seen as the first in a sequence of anti-Semitic events which culminated in the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Nirenberg|editor=Gerd Althoff|others=Johannes Fried|title=Medieval Concepts of the Past: Ritual, Memory, Historiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxS6-pQZzGsC&amp;pg=PA279|date=31 January 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78066-7|pages=279–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish populations felt that they had been abandoned by their Christian neighbors and rulers during the massacres and lost faith in all promises and charters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Malamat|title=A History of the Jewish People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&amp;pg=PA413|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39731-6|pages=419–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Jews chose self-defence. But their means of self-defence were limited and their casualties only increased. Most of the forced conversions proved ineffective. Many Jews reverted to their original faith later. The pope protested this but Emperor Henry IV agreed to permitting these reversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Malamat|title=A History of the Jewish People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&amp;pg=PA413|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39731-6|pages=413–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The massacres began a new epoch for Jewry in Christendom. The Jews had preserved their faith from social pressure, now they had to preserve it at sword point. The massacres during the crusades strengthened the Jewry from within spiritually. The Jewish perspective was that their struggle was Israel's struggle to hallow the name of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Malamat|title=A History of the Jewish People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&amp;pg=PA413|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39731-6|pages=414–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1099, Jews helped the Arabs to defend Jerusalem against the [[Crusaders]]. When the city fell, the Crusaders gathered many Jews in a synagogue and set it on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Malamat|title=A History of the Jewish People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&amp;pg=PA413|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39731-6|pages=413–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Haifa, the Jews almost single-handedly defended the town against the Crusaders, holding out for a month, (June–July 1099).&lt;ref name=SKatz/&gt; At this time there were Jewish communities scattered all over the country, including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. As Jews were not allowed to hold land during the Crusader period, they worked at trades and commerce in the coastal towns during times of quiescence. Most were artisans: glassblowers in [[Sidon]], furriers and dyers in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=SKatz/&gt;

During this period, the [[Masoretes]] of Tiberias established the ''[[niqqud]]'', a system of [[diacritic]]al signs used to represent vowels or distinguish between alternative pronunciations of letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Numerous [[Piyyut|piyutim]] and [[midrash]]im were recorded in Palestine at this time.&lt;ref name=SKatz/&gt;

[[Maimonides]] wrote that in 1165 he visited Jerusalem and went to the Temple Mount, where he prayed in the "great, holy house".&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaCharedim Mitzvat Tshuva Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides established a yearly holiday for himself and his sons, the 6th of [[Cheshvan]], commemorating the day he went up to pray on the Temple Mount, and another, the 9th of Cheshvan, commemorating the day he merited to pray at the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]].

In 1141 [[Yehuda Halevi]] issued a call to Jews to emigrate to the land of Israel and took on the long journey himself. After a stormy passage from [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], he arrived in Egyptian [[Alexandria]], where he was enthusiastically greeted by friends and admirers. At [[Damietta]], he had to struggle against his heart, and the pleadings of his friend Ḥalfon ha-Levi, that he remain in [[Egypt]], where he would be free from intolerant oppression. He started on the rough route overland. He was met along the way by Jews in [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and [[Damascus]]. Jewish legend relates that as he came near Jerusalem, overpowered by the sight of the Holy City, he sang his most beautiful elegy, the celebrated "Zionide" (''Zion ha-lo Tish'ali''). At that instant, an Arab had galloped out of a gate and rode him down; he was killed in the accident.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Mamluk period (1260–1517)===
In the years 1260–1516, the land of Israel was part of the Empire of the [[Mamluk]]s, who ruled first from [[Turkey]], then from Egypt. The period was characterized by war, uprisings, bloodshed and destruction. Jews suffered persecution and humiliation, but the surviving records note at least 30 Jewish urban and rural communities at the opening of the 16th century.

[[Nahmanides]] is recorded as settling in the Old City of Jerusalem in 1267. He moved to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where he was active in spreading Jewish learning, which was at that time neglected in the Holy Land. He gathered a circle of pupils around him, and people came in crowds, even from the district of the Euphrates, to hear him. [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] were said to have attended his lectures, among them Aaron ben Joseph the Elder. He later became one of the greatest [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaite]] authorities. Shortly after Nahmanides' arrival in Jerusalem, he addressed a letter to his son Nahman, in which he described the desolation of the Holy City. At the time, it had only two Jewish inhabitants—two brothers, dyers by trade. In a later letter from Acre, Nahmanides counsels his son to cultivate humility, which he considers to be the first of virtues. In another, addressed to his second son, who occupied an official position at the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] court, Nahmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality. Nahmanides died after reaching seventy-six, and his remains were interred at [[Haifa]], by the grave of [[Yechiel of Paris]].

Yechiel had [[aliyah|emigrated]] to Acre in 1260, along with his son and a large group of followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/acco.html |title=Jewish Zionist Education |publisher=Jafi.org.il |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013142810/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/acco.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lookstein.org/resources/bionotes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There he established the Tamudic academy ''Midrash haGadol d'Paris''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishhistory.com/jh.php?id=AdditionalReadings&amp;content=content/segal_ch17 |title=Section III: The Bibilical Age: Chapter Seventeen: Awaiting the Messiah |author=Benjamin J.

In 1488 [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], commentator on the [[Mishnah]], arrived in Jerusalem; this marked a new period of return for the Jewish community in the land.

====Spain, North Africa, and the Middle East====
{{Main article|History of the Jews in Spain}}

During the Middle Ages, Jews were generally better treated by Islamic rulers than Christian ones. Despite second-class citizenship, Jews played prominent roles in Muslim courts, and experienced a "Golden Age" in [[Moorish Spain]] about 900–1100, though the situation deteriorated after that time. [[Riots]] resulting in the deaths of Jews did however occur in North Africa through the centuries and especially in [[Morocco]], [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]], where eventually Jews were forced to live in ghettos.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Roumani, ''The Case of the Jews from Arab Countries: A Neglected Issue'', 1977, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 11th century, Muslims in Spain conducted pogroms against the Jews; those occurred in Cordoba in 1011 and in [[1066 Granada massacre|Granada in 1066]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Granada |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6855-granada |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, the governments of [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Yemen]] enacted decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues. At certain times, Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face death in some parts of Yemen, Morocco and [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Jews_in_Arab_lands_%28gen%29.html |title=The Treatment of Jews in Arab/Islamic Countries |author=Mitchell Bard |year=2012 |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Almohad]]s, who had taken control of much of Islamic Iberia by 1172, surpassed the [[Almoravides]] in fundamentalist outlook.

===Europe===
{{Main article|Jews in the Middle Ages}}
According to the American writer [[James P. Carroll|James Carroll]], "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James. ''[[Constantine's Sword]]'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2001) {{ISBN|978-0-395-77927-9}} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish populations have existed in Europe, especially in the area of the former Roman Empire, from very early times. As Jewish males had emigrated, some sometimes took wives from local populations, as is shown by the various [[Mitochondrial DNA|MtDNA]], compared to [[Y-DNA#Genetic genealogy|Y-DNA]] among Jewish populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/14/science/in-dna-new-clues-to-jewish-roots.html |title=In DNA, New Clues to Jewish Roots |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |date=May 14, 2002 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=June 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups were joined by traders and later on by members of the diaspora.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Records of Jewish communities in France (see [[History of the Jews in France]]) and Germany (see [[History of the Jews in Germany]]) date from the 4th century, and substantial Jewish communities in Spain were noted even earlier.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The historian [[Norman Cantor]] and other 20th-century scholars dispute the tradition that the Middle Ages was a uniformly difficult time for Jews. Before the Church became fully organized as an institution with an increasing array of rules, early medieval society was tolerant. Between 800 and 1100, an estimated 1.5 million Jews lived in Christian Europe. As they were not Christians, they were not included as a [[Estates of the realm|division]] of the feudal system of clergy, knights and serfs. This means that they did not have to satisfy the oppressive demands for labor and military conscription that Christian commoners suffered. In relations with the Christian society, the Jews were protected by kings, princes and bishops, because of the crucial services they provided in three areas: finance, administration and medicine.&lt;ref name="Cantor"/&gt; The lack of political strengths did leave Jews vulnerable to exploitation through extreme taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ebenhard Isenmann|editor=Richard Bonney|title=The Rise of the Fiscal State in Europe c.1200-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U24lRLy_qT8C&amp;pg=PA259|date=2 September 1999|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-154220-6|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian scholars interested in the Bible consulted with Talmudic rabbis. As the Roman Catholic Church strengthened as an institution, the Franciscan and Dominican preaching orders were founded, and there was a rise of competitive middle-class, town-dwelling Christians. By 1300, the friars and local priests staged the Passion Plays during Holy Week, which depicted Jews (in contemporary dress) killing Christ, according to Gospel accounts. From this period, persecution of Jews and deportations became endemic. Around 1500, Jews found relative security and a renewal of prosperity in present-day [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="Cantor"&gt;Norman F. Cantor, ''The Last Knight: The Twilight of the Middle Ages and the Birth of the Modern Era'', Free Press, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-2688-2}}, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1300, Jews suffered more discrimination and persecution in Christian Europe. Europe's Jewry was mainly urban and literate. The Christians were inclined to regard Jews as obstinate deniers of the truth because in their view the Jews were expected to know of the truth of the Christian doctrines from their knowledge of the Jewish scriptures. Jews were aware of the pressure to accept Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Malamat|title=A History of the Jewish People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kSovzudhFUC&amp;pg=PA413|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39731-6|pages=412–}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Catholics were forbidden by the church to loan money for interest, some Jews became prominent moneylenders. Christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having such a class of people who could supply capital for their use without being liable to excommunication. As a result, the money trade of western Europe became a specialty of the Jews. But, in almost every instance when Jews acquired large amounts through banking transactions, during their lives or upon their deaths, the king would take it over.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5764-england "England" [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] (1906)]&lt;/ref&gt; Jews became imperial {{-"}}''servi cameræ''{{-"}}, the property of the King, who might present them and their possessions to princes or cities.

Jews were frequently massacred and exiled from various European countries. The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[People's Crusade]] (1096) flourishing Jewish communities on the Rhine and the Danube were utterly destroyed. In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in France were subject to frequent massacres. They were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]]. The Crusades were followed by massive expulsions, including (in 1290) the banishing of all English Jews;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin R. Mundill|title=England's Jewish Solution: Experiment and Expulsion, 1262-1290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSKLfi_j110C|date=16 May 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52026-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1396 100,000 Jews were expelled from France; and in 1421, thousands were expelled from Austria. Over this time many Jews in Europe, either fleeing or being expelled, migrated to Poland, where they prospered into another [[History of the Jews in Poland#Early history to Golden Age: 966–1572|Golden Age]].

==Early Modern period==
Historians who study modern Jewry have identified four different paths by which European Jews were "modernized" and thus integrated into the mainstream of European society. A common approach has been to view the process through the lens of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as Jews faced the promise and the challenges posed by political emancipation. Scholars that use this approach have focused on two social types as paradigms for the decline of Jewish tradition and as agents of the sea changes in Jewish culture that led to the collapse of the [[ghetto]]. The first of these two social types is the [[Court Jew]] who is portrayed as a forerunner of the modern Jew, having achieved integration with and participation in the proto-capitalist economy and court society of central European states such as the [[Habsburg Empire]]. In contrast to the cosmopolitan Court Jew, the second social type presented by historians of modern Jewry is the ''maskil'', (learned person), a proponent of the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment). This narrative sees the maskil's pursuit of secular scholarship and his rationalistic critiques of rabbinic tradition as laying a durable intellectual foundation for the secularization of Jewish society and culture. The established paradigm has been one in which Ashkenazic Jews entered modernity through a self-conscious process of westernization led by "highly atypical, Germanized Jewish intellectuals". Haskalah gave birth to the Reform and Conservative movements and planted the seeds of [[Zionism]] while at the same time encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which Jews resided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reframing Jewish History |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10513 |accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At around the same time that Haskalah was developing, [[Hasidic Judaism]] was spreading as a movement that preached a world view almost opposed to the Haskalah.

In the 1990s, the concept of the "[[Port Jew]]" has been suggested as an "alternate path to modernity" that was distinct from the European [[Haskalah]]. In contrast to the focus on Ashkenazic Germanized Jews, the concept of the Port Jew focused on the Sephardi conversos who fled the Inquisition and resettled in European port towns on the coast of the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Eastern seaboard of the United States.&lt;ref name=HelenFry&gt;{{cite journal |title=Port Jews: Jewish Communities in Cosmpolitan Maritime Trading Centres, 1550–1950 |first=Helen P. |last=Fry|journal=European Judaism |volume= 36 |publisher=Frank Cass Publishers |year=2002 |ISBN=978-0-7146-8286-0|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5002650793 |quote=Port Jews were a social type, usually those who were involved in seafaring and maritime trade, who (like Court Jews) could be seen as the earliest modern Jews.

'Their Diaspora connections and accumulated expertise lay in exactly the areas of overseas expansion that were then of interest to mercantilist governments.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court Jew===
{{main article|Court Jew|shtadlan}}
[[Court Jew]]s were [[Jew]]ish [[banker]]s or businessmen who lent money and handled the finances of some of the [[Christian]] [[Europe]]an noble houses. Corresponding historical terms are ''Jewish [[bailiff]]'' and ''[[shtadlan]]''.

Examples of what would be later called court Jews emerged when local rulers used services of Jewish bankers for short-term loans. They lent money to nobles and in the process gained social influence. Noble patrons of court Jews employed them as [[financier]]s, suppliers, [[diplomat]]s and [[trade delegate]]s. Court Jews could use their family connections, and connections between each other, to provision their sponsors with, among other things, food, arms, ammunition and precious metals. In return for their services, court Jews gained social privileges, including up to noble status for themselves, and could live outside the Jewish ghettos. Some nobles wanted to keep their bankers in their own courts. And because they were under noble protection, they were exempted from [[rabbi]]nical jurisdiction.

From medieval times, court Jews could amass personal fortunes and gained political and social influence. Sometimes they were also prominent people in the local Jewish community and could use their influence to protect and influence their brethren. Sometimes they were the only Jews who could interact with the local high society and present petitions of the Jews to the ruler. However, the court Jew had social connections and influence in the Christian world mainly through his Christian patrons. Due to the precarious position of Jews, some nobles could just ignore their debts. If the sponsoring noble died, his Jewish financier could face exile or execution.{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}

===Spain and Portugal===
Significant repression of Spain's numerous community occurred during the 14th century, notably a [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|major pogrom in 1391]] which resulted in the majority of Spain's 300,000 Jews converting to Catholicism. With the [[Granada War|conquest of the Muslim Kingdom of Granada]] in 1492, the Catholic monarchs issued the [[Alhambra Decree]] whereby Spain's remaining 100,000 Jews were forced to choose between conversion and exile. As a result, an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 Jews left Spain, the remainder joining Spain's already numerous Converso community. Perhaps a quarter of a million Conversos thus were gradually absorbed by the dominant Catholic culture, although those among them who secretly practiced Judaism were subject to 40 years of intense repression by the Spanish Inquisition. This was particularly the case up until 1530, after which the trials of Conversos by the Inquisition dropped to 3% of the total. Similar expulsions of Sephardic Jews occurred 1493 in [[Sicily]] (37,000 Jews) and Portugal in 1496. The expelled Spanish Jews fled mainly to the Ottoman Empire and North Africa and Portugal. A small number also settled in Holland and England.

===Port Jew===
{{main article|Port Jew}}

The [[Port Jew]] describes Jews who were involved in the seafaring and maritime economy of Europe, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries. Helen Fry suggests that they could be considered to have been "the earliest modern Jews". According to Fry, Port Jews often arrived as "refugees from the Inquisition" and the expulsion of Jews from Iberia. They were allowed to settle in port cities as merchants granted permission to trade in ports such as Amsterdam, London, Trieste and Hamburg. Fry notes that their connections with the [[Jewish Diaspora]] and their expertise in maritime trade made them of particular interest to the mercantilist governments of Europe.&lt;ref name=HelenFry /&gt; Lois Dubin describes Port Jews as Jewish merchants who were "valued for their engagement in the international maritime trade upon which such cities thrived".&lt;ref&gt;Dubin p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Sorkin and others have characterized the socio-cultural profile of these men as marked by a flexibility towards religion and a "reluctant cosmopolitanism that was alien to both traditional and 'enlightened' Jewish identities".

===Ottoman Empire===
{{Main article|History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire}}

During the Classical Ottoman period (1300–1600), the Jews, together with most other communities of the empire, enjoyed a certain level of prosperity. Compared with other Ottoman subjects, they were the predominant power in commerce and trade as well in diplomacy and other high offices. In the 16th century especially, the Jews were the most prominent under the ''millets'', the apogee of Jewish influence could arguably be the appointment of [[Joseph Nasi]] to [[Sanjak-bey]] (''governor'', a rank usually only bestowed upon Muslims) of the island of [[Naxos Island|Naxos]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Issawi &amp; Dmitri Gondicas; ''Ottoman Greeks in the Age of Nationalism'', Princeton, (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Battle of Yarmuk]] when the [[Levant]] passed under Muslim Rule, thirty Jewish communities existed in Haifa, Sh’chem, Hebron, Ramleh, Gaza, Jerusalem, and many in the north. Safed became a spiritual centre for the Jews and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] was compiled there as well as many Kabbalistic texts. The first Hebrew printing press, and the first printing in Western Asia began in 1577.

Jews lived in the geographic area of Asia Minor (modern Turkey, but more geographically either Anatolia or Asia Minor) for more than 2,400 years. Initial prosperity in Hellenistic times had faded under Christian Byzantine rule, but recovered somewhat under the rule of the various Muslim governments that displaced and succeeded rule from Constantinople. For much of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, Turkey was a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, and it continues to have a small Jewish population today. The situation where Jews both enjoyed cultural and economical prosperity at times but were widely persecuted at other times was summarised by G.E. Von Grunebaum :

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizeable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Poland-Lithuania===
{{Further information|History of Jews in Poland}}

In the 17th century, there were many significant Jewish populations in Western Europe. The relatively tolerant Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe that dated back to 13th century and enjoyed relative prosperity and freedom for nearly four hundred years; however the calm situation there ended when Polish and Lithuanian Jews were slaughtered in the hundreds of thousands by the cossacks during [[Chmielnicki uprising]] (1648) and by the [[Swedish wars]] (1655). Driven by these and other persecutions, Jews moved back to Western Europe in the 17th century. The last ban on Jews (by the English) was revoked in 1654, but periodic expulsions from individual cities still occurred, and Jews were often restricted from land ownership, or forced to live in [[ghettos]].

With the [[Partition of Poland]] in the late 18th century, the Jewish population was split between the [[Russian Empire]], [[Austro-Hungary]], and [[Prussia]], which divided [[Poland]] for themselves.

===The European Enlightenment and Haskalah (18th century)===
During the period of the [[European Renaissance]] and Enlightenment, significant changes occurred within the Jewish community. The [[Haskalah]] movement paralleled the wider Enlightenment, as Jews in the 18th century began to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society. Secular and scientific education was added to the traditional religious instruction received by students, and interest in a national Jewish identity, including a revival in the study of Jewish history and Hebrew, started to grow. Haskalah gave birth to the Reform and Conservative movements and planted the seeds of [[Zionism]] while at the same time encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which Jews resided. At around the same time another movement was born, one preaching almost the opposite of Haskalah, [[Hasidic Judaism]]. Hasidic Judaism began in the 18th century by [[Baal Shem Tov|Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov]], and quickly gained a following with its more exuberant, mystical approach to religion. These two movements, and the traditional orthodox approach to Judaism from which they spring, formed the basis for the modern divisions within Jewish observance.

At the same time, the outside world was changing, and debates began over the potential emancipation of the Jews (granting them equal rights). The first country to do so was France, during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. Even so, Jews were expected to integrate, not continue their traditions. This ambivalence is demonstrated in the famous speech of [[Clermont-Tonnerre]] before the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in 1789:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We must refuse everything to the Jews as a nation and accord everything to Jews as individuals. We must withdraw recognition from their judges; they should only have our judges. We must refuse legal protection to the maintenance of the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they should not be allowed to form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, they do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Hasidic Jews praying in the synagogue on [[Yom Kippur]], by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]]]]

[[Hasidic Judaism]] is a branch of [[Orthodox Judaism]] that promotes spirituality and joy through the popularisation and internalisation of [[Jewish mysticism]] as the fundamental aspects of the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]]. Hasidism comprises part of contemporary [[Haredi|Ultra-Orthodox]] Judaism, alongside the previous Talmudic [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian-Yeshiva]] approach and the Oriental [[Sephardi Judaism|Sephardi]] tradition.

It was founded in 18th-century [[Eastern Europe]] by Rabbi Israel [[Baal Shem Tov]] as a reaction against overly [[Talmud|legalistic]] Judaism. Opposite to this, Hasidic teachings cherished the sincerity and concealed holiness of the unlettered common folk, and their equality with the scholarly elite. The emphasis on the [[Divine immanence|Immanent]] Divine presence in everything gave new value to prayer and deeds of kindness, alongside Rabbinic supremacy of [[Torah study|study]], and replaced historical [[Kabbalah|mystical (kabbalistic)]] and [[Musar literature|ethical (musar)]] [[Asceticism in Judaism|asceticism]] and [[Maggid|admonishment]] with optimism, encouragement, and daily [[Deveikut|fervour]]. This populist emotional revival accompanied the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine [[Panentheism]], through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of mystical thought. The adjustment of Jewish values sought to add to required standards of ritual [[Halacha|observance]], while relaxing others where inspiration predominated. Its communal gatherings celebrate soulful [[Nigun|song]] and [[Yiddish literature#Hasidic and Haskalah literature|storytelling]] as forms of mystical devotion.{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}

==19th century==
[[File:Napoleon stellt den israelitischen Kult wieder her, 30. Mai 1806.jpg|thumb|right|275px|An 1806 French print depicts [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] emancipating the Jews.]]
Though persecution still existed, emancipation spread throughout Europe in the 19th century. [[Napoleon]] invited Jews to leave the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe]] and seek refuge in the newly created tolerant political regimes that offered equality under Napoleonic Law (see [[Napoleon and the Jews]]). By 1871, with Germany’s emancipation of Jews, every European country except Russia had emancipated its Jews.

Despite increasing integration of the Jews with secular society, a new form of anti-Semitism emerged, based on the ideas of race and nationhood rather than the religious hatred of the Middle Ages. This form of anti-Semitism held that Jews were a separate and inferior race from the [[Aryan]] people of Western Europe, and led to the emergence of political parties in France, Germany, and Austria-Hungary that campaigned on a platform of rolling back emancipation. This form of anti-Semitism emerged frequently in European culture, most famously in the [[Dreyfus Trial]] in France. These persecutions, along with state-sponsored [[pogrom]]s in Russia in the late 19th century, led a number of Jews to believe that they would only be safe in their own nation. See [[Theodor Herzl]] and [[History of Zionism]].

During this period, Jewish migration to the [[United States]] (see [[American Jews]]) created a large new community mostly freed of the restrictions of Europe. Over 2 million Jews arrived in the United States between 1890 and 1924, most from Russia and Eastern Europe. A similar case occurred in the southern tip of the continent, specifically in the countries of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]].

==20th century==

===Modern Zionism===
{{Main article|History of Zionism}}
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
[[File:Herzl-balcony.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Theodor Herzl]], visionary of the Jewish State, in 1901.]]
During the 1870s and 1880s the Jewish population in Europe began to more actively discuss immigration back to Israel and the re-establishment of the Jewish Nation in its national homeland, fulfilling the biblical prophecies relating to [[Shivat tzion|Shivat Tzion]]. In 1882 the first Zionist settlement—[[Rishon LeZion]]—was founded by immigrants who belonged to the "[[Hovevei Zion]]" movement. Later on, the "[[Bilu]]" movement established many other settlements in the land of Israel.

The Zionist movement was founded officially after the [[Kattowitz convention]] (1884) and the [[World Zionist Congress]] (1897), and it was [[Theodor Herzl]] who began the struggle to establish a state for the Jews.

After the [[First World War]], it seemed that the conditions to establish such a state had arrived: The United Kingdom captured [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Jews received the promise of a "National Home" from the British in the form of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], given to [[Chaim Weizmann]].

In 1920 the British Mandate of Palestine began and the pro-Jewish [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] was appointed High Commissioner in Palestine, the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] was established and several big Jewish immigration waves to Palestine occurred. The Arab co-inhabitants of Palestine were hostile to increasing Jewish immigration however, and began to oppose Jewish settlement and the pro-Jewish policy of the British government by violent means.

Arab gangs began performing violent acts and murders on convoys and on the Jewish population. After the 1920 [[1920 Palestine riots|Arab riots]] and 1921 [[Jaffa riots]], the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British had no desire to confront local Arab gangs over their attacks on Palestinian Jews. Believing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs, the Jewish leadership created the Haganah organization to protect their farms and Kibbutzim.

Major riots occurred during the [[1929 Palestine riots]] and the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]].

Due to the increasing violence the United Kingdom gradually started to backtrack from the original idea of a Jewish state and to speculate on a [[binational solution]] or an Arab state that would have a Jewish minority.

Meanwhile, the Jews of Europe and the United States gained success in the fields of the science, culture and the economy. Among those generally considered the most famous were scientist [[Albert Einstein]] and philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. A disproportionate number of [[Nobel Prize]] winners at this time were Jewish, as is still the case.&lt;ref name="Jewish Nobel Prize Winners"/&gt; In Russia, many Jews were involved in the [[October Revolution]] and belonged to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].

===The Holocaust===
{{Main article|History of the Jews during World War II|The Holocaust}}
[[File:Razzia in een getto (detail).jpg|110px|thumb|A boy raises his hands when the Jews leave the bunkers after the submission of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]]]
[[File:Rows of bodies of dead inmates fill the yard of Lager Nordhausen, a Gestapo concentration camp.jpg|left|thumb|Bodies of inmates of the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] Nazi concentration camp who died during British [[Bombing of Nordhausen in World War II|bombing raids]] on April 3 and 4, 1945]]
In 1933, with the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi party]] in Germany, the Jewish situation became more severe. Economic crises, racial anti-Semitic laws, and a fear of an upcoming war led many Jews to flee from Europe to Palestine, to the United States and to the Soviet Union.

In 1939 [[World War II]] began and until 1941 [[Hitler]] occupied almost all of Europe, including Poland—where millions of Jews were living at that time—and France. In 1941, following the invasion of the Soviet Union, the [[Final Solution]] began, an extensive organized operation on an unprecedented scale, aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people, and resulting in the persecution and murder of Jews in political Europe, inclusive of European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). This [[genocide]], in which approximately six million Jews were murdered methodically and with horrifying cruelty, is known as [[The Holocaust]] or ''Shoah'' (Hebrew term). In Poland, more than one million Jews were murdered in [[gas chambers]] at the [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp alone.

The massive scale of the Holocaust, and the horrors that happened during it, heavily affected the Jewish nation and world public opinion, which only understood the dimensions of the Holocaust after the war. Efforts were then increased to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.

===The establishment of the State of Israel===
{{Main article|History of Israel}}
{{See also|Israel|Declaration of Independence (Israel)}}
{{History of Israel}}
In 1945 the Jewish resistance organizations in Palestine unified and established the Jewish Resistance Movement. The movement began attacking the British authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/resist.html |title=The Jewish Resistance Movement |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[King David Hotel bombing]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], president of the [[WZO]] appealed to the movement to cease all further military activity until a decision would be reached by the [[Jewish Agency]]. The Jewish Agency backed Weizmann's recommendation to cease activities, a decision reluctantly accepted by the Haganah, but not by the Irgun and the Lehi. The JRM was dismantled and each of the founding groups continued operating according to their own policy.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, Edward (1982).

But remained permanently uncooperative.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish leadership decided to center the struggle in the illegal immigration to Palestine and began organizing massive amount of Jewish war refugees from Europe, without the approval of the British authorities. This immigration contributed a great deal to the Jewish settlements in Israel in the world public opinion and the British authorities decided to let the United Nations decide upon the fate of Palestine.{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}

On November 29, 1947, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted [[Resolution 181]](II) recommending partitioning Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish leadership accepted the decision but the Arab League and the leadership of Palestinian Arabs opposed it. Following a period of [[1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] started.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In the middle of the war, after the last soldiers of the British mandate left Palestine, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed on May 14, 1948, the establishment of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]] to be known as the [[State of Israel]]. In 1949 the war ended and the state of Israel started building the state and absorbing massive waves of hundreds of thousands of Jews from all over the world.

Since 1948, Israel has been involved in a series of major military conflicts, including the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], 1967 [[Six-Day War]], 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], [[1982 Lebanon War]], and [[2006 Lebanon War]], as well as a nearly constant series of ongoing minor conflicts.

Since 1977, an ongoing and largely unsuccessful series of diplomatic efforts have been initiated by Israel, Palestinian organisations, their neighbours, and other parties, including the United States and the European Union, to bring about a [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|peace process]] to resolve conflicts between Israel and its neighbors, mostly over the fate of the Palestinian people.

==21st century==
[[Israel]] is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with a population of over 8 million people, of whom about 6 million are [[Israeli Jews|Jewish]]. The largest Jewish communities are in Israel and the [[American Jews|United States]], with major communities in France, Argentina, Russia, England, and Canada.

[[File:(1825) JOHN GILLIES.jpg|thumbnail|John Gillies (c1820)]]

'''John Gillies''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100|FRSE|FRS|FSA}} LLD ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɪ|l|i|s}}; 1747–1836) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] tutor, historian and [[man of letters]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Brechin]], in [[Forfarshire]] the son of Robert Gillies of Little Keithock, a merchant, and his wife, Margaret Smith. He was educated in Brechin and then sent to the [[University of Glasgow]], where, at the age of twenty, he acted for a short time as substitute for the professor of Greek. He graduated MA in 1764. He lived for a while in Germany and returned in 1784. He was awarded a doctorate (LLD) in the same year.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in January 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27gillies%27%29|title= Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= ( November 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[James Gregory (physician)|James Gregory]], [[William Wright (botanist)|William Wright]], and [[John Playfair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the death of [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] (1721-1793), Gillies was appointed [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Historiographer Royal for Scotland]]. In his old age he retired to [[Clapham]], where he died on 15 February 1836. He was the older brother of judge [[Adam Gillies, Lord Gillies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Hamilton  | first = J.

==Works==
His ''History of Ancient Greece, its Colonies and Conquests''  was published in 1786; it was translated into French and German. This work was written with a strong monarchist bias.  See for instance the opening 'dedication to the king': 'The history of Greece exposes the dangerous turbulence of democracy, and arraigns the 	despotism of tyrants.  By describing the incurable evils inherent in every form of Republican policy, it evinces the inestimable benefits resulting to liberty itself from the 	lawful dominion of hereditary kings, and the steady operation of well-regulated monarchy'.
 
Other works included:

* ''View of the Reign of Frederic II of Prussia, with a Parallel between that Prince and Philip II of Macedon'' (1789), rather a panegyric than a critical history; 
* translations of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Rhetoric'' (1823) and ''Ethics'' and ''Politics'' (1786-1797); 
* translations of the ''Orations'' of [[Lysias]] and [[Isocrates]] (1778); and '
*''History of the World from Alexander to Augustus'' (1807).

'''Jon Edward Martin''' is an American [[author]], who writes [[historical fiction]] novels. He is best known for his novels about [[Ancient Greece]]. He is a native of [[Massachusetts]], and holds a bachelor's degree in English Literature. He is married with four children; a daughter and three sons and he lives in [[Virginia]].

Jon is a member of the [[Historical Novel Society]].  He also is an assistant editor for ''Sparta - Journal of Ancient Spartan and Greek History''.

==Works==

Martin's historical fiction books follow the sequence of real events of ancient times. He typically writes his novels using the ancient terms and place names along with popular historical figures in his attempt to capture the spirit of the times.

As a [[historical novel]]ist Jon Edward Martin's ancient fiction is characterized by a willingness to explore historical events from a different point of view.

His first novel was ''In Kithairon’s Shadow''. His subsequent historical novels were all set in ancient Greece; a novel about the Battle of Marathon, ''The Headlong God of War'' and an epic novel about the battle that changed the route of ancient Sparta’s  history, ''Shades of Artemis''.
His latest work is a continuation of "Shades of Artemis" entitled, "Nemesis". This novel follows the life of the Spartan commander Gylippus, the architect of Athen's calamitous defeat at the battle of Syracuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3814">In [[Japanese mythology]], the {{nihongo|'''Kamiyonanayo'''|神世七代||lit. "Seven Generations of the [[Age of the Gods]]"}} are the seven generations of ''[[kami]]'' that emerged after the formation of heaven and earth.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Kojiki]], these deities appeared after the [[Kotoamatsukami]]. The first two generations were [[hitorigami]] while the five that followed came into being as male-female pairs of ''kami'': male deities and sisters that were at the same time married couples. In total the ''Kamiyonanayo'' consist of 12 deities in this chronicle.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p72"/&gt;

In contrast, the chronicle [[Nihon Shoki]], points out that this group was the first to appear after the creation of the universe. It also states that the first three generations of deities were ''hitorigami'' and that the other generations of deities were pairs of the opposite sex. Finally the Nihon Shoki uses a different spelling for the names of all deities.

The last generation formed by [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] were the couple that would be responsible for the creation of the [[Japanese archipelago]] (''[[Kuniumi]]'') and would engender other deities (''[[Kamiumi]]'').&lt;ref name="kojiki-p75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kojiki-p77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2682">The '''Laboratory Response Network''' (LRN) is a collaborative effort within the US federal government involving the [[Association of Public Health Laboratories]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC). Most state public health laboratories participate as reference laboratories (formerly level B/C) of the LRN. These facilities support hundreds of sentinel (formerly level A) laboratories in local hospitals throughout the United States and can provide sophisticated confirmatory diagnosis and typing of [[biological agent]]s that may be used in a [[bioterrorist]] attack or other bio-agent incident. The LRN was established in 1999.

==Levels==
The LRN consists of a loose  network of government labs at three levels:&lt;ref&gt;Cieslak, Theodore J. and George W. Christopher (2007), "Medical Management of Potential Biological Casualties: A Stepwise Approach", In: [http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/biological_warfare/biological.html Dembek, Zygmunt F. (2007), ''Medical Aspects of Biological Warfare''], (Series: [[Textbook of Military Medicine|Textbooks of Military Medicine]]), [[Washington, DC]]: The [[Borden Institute]], pg 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentinel Laboratories===
These laboratories, found in many hospitals and local public health facilities, have the ability to rule out specific bioterrorism threat agents, to handle specimens safely, and to forward specimens to higher-level labs within the network.

===Reference Laboratories===
These laboratories (more than 100), typically found at [[state health department]]s and at military, veterinary, agricultural, and water-testing facilities, can rule on the presence of the various biological threat agents. They can use [[BSL-3]] practices and can often conduct [[Polymerase chain reaction|nucleic acid amplification]] and [[molecular typing studies]].

===National Laboratories===
These laboratories, including those at CDC and [[U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] (USAMRIID), can use [[BSL-4]] practices and serve as the final authority in the evaluation of potential bioterrorism specimens. They provide specialized reagents to lower level laboratories and have the ability to bank specimens, perform serotyping, and detect [[Genetic recombination|genetic recombinant]]s and [[chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75500">This is a '''list of official and unofficial names for time spans''' in the [[geologic timescale]] and units of [[chronostratigraphy]]. Since many of the smallest subdivisions of the geologic timescale were in the past defined on regional [[lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphic]] units, there are many alternative names that overlap. The body concerned with standardizing the names of geochronologic units is the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS). In 2008 however, even though the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eon (geology)|eon]] is almost completely divided into internationally recognizable units, local subdivisions are often still preferred over the international ones.

! Name ([[English language|English]])&lt;ref&gt;Names from local versions of the geologic timescale can often be found in the local language. The English name is usually found by replacing the [[suffix]] in the local language for -an or -ian. Examples for "local" suffices are -en ([[French language|French]]), -ano ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), -ium ([[German language|German]]), -aidd ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]) or -aan (Flemish [[Dutch language|Dutch]]). The English name "Norian", for example, becomes Noriano in Spanish, Norium in German, Noraidd in Welsh or Norien in French.&lt;/ref&gt;
! base/start ([[Megaannum|Ma]])&lt;ref name="time"&gt;Time is given in Megaannum (million years [[Before Present|BP]], unless other units are given in the table. BP stands for "years before present". For ICS-units the absolute ages are taken from Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oyo Empire''' was a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] empire of what is today Western and North central [[Nigeria]]. Established in the 15th century, the Oyo Empire grew to become one of the largest West African states. It rose through the outstanding organizational and administrative skills of the Yoruba people, wealth gained from trade and its powerful [[cavalry]]. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} holding sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in [[Yorubaland]], but also over nearby African states, notably the [[Fon people|Fon]] [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in the modern [[Republic of Benin]] to the west.

==Mythical origins==
{{Yoruba people}}
The origins of the Oyo Empire lie with [[Oranyan]] (also known as Oranmiyan), the last prince of the Yoruba Kingdom of Ile-Ife ([[Ife]]). Oranyan made an agreement with his brother to launch a punitive raid on their northern neighbors for insulting their father [[Oduduwa]], the first [[Ooni of Ife]]. On the way to the battle, the brothers quarreled and the army split up.&lt;ref name="Stride290"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://litcaf.com/oranyan/|title=Oranyan|date=2016-01-12|work=Litcaf|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oranyan's force was too small to make a successful attack, so he wandered the southern shore until reaching Bussa. There the local chief entertained him and provided a large snake with a magic charm attached to its throat.

The chief instructed Oranyan to follow the snake until it stopped somewhere for seven days and disappeared into the ground. Oranyan followed the advice and founded Oyo where the serpent stopped. The site is remembered as [[Ajaka]]. Oranyan made Oyo his new kingdom and became the first "oba" (meaning 'king' or 'ruler' in the [[Yoruba language]]) with the title of "Alaafin of Oyo" (Alaafin means 'owner of the palace' in Yoruba).  He left all his treasures in Ife and allowed another king to rule there.&lt;ref name="Stride291"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;291&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, Oyo-ile was at war with the Bariba of Borgu, who wanted to subjugate the new city still under construction. Orangun Ajagunla of Ila, Oranmiyan's elder brother, stormed in with his men to assist. Not long after the war was won, Oranmiyan had a son, Ajuwon Ajaka; much later Arabambi was born by the woman from Tapa ([[Nupe people|Nupe]]). It is believed that the name "Sango" was given by his maternal grandfather or he adopted it from the local name for the God of Thunder. Either way the royal family was devoted to The Spirits of Thunder (Jakuta) and War (Ogun).

==Early period (14th century–1535)==
[[File:OyoIle plan bw.gif|thumb|right|150px|A Survey of Old Oyo Palace Compound]]
Oranyan, the first oba (king) of Oyo, was succeeded by Oba Ajaka, Alaafin of Oyo. Ajaka was deposed, because he lacked Yoruba military virtue and allowed his sub-chiefs too much independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://litcaf.com/ajaka/|title=Ajaka|date=2016-01-12|work=Litcaf|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership was then conferred upon Ajaka's brother, [[Shango]], who was later defined as the deity of thunder and lightning. Ajaka was restored after Sango's death. Ajaka returned to the throne thoroughly more warlike and oppressive. His successor, Kori, managed to conquer the rest of what later historians would refer to as metropolitan Oyo.&lt;ref name="Stride291"/&gt;

===Oyo-Ile===
The heart of metropolitan Oyo was its capital at Oyo-Ile (also known as ''Oyo Katunga'' or ''Old Oyo'' or Oyo-oro).&lt;ref name="Goddard"&gt;Goddard 1971, pp.&amp;nbsp;207–211.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most important structures in Oyo-Ile were the 'Afin,' or palace of the Oba, and his market. The palace was at the center of the city close to the Oba's market called 'Oja-Oba'. Around the capital was a tall earthen wall for defense with 17 gates. The importance of the two large structures (the palace and the Oja Oba) signified the importance of the king in Oyo.

===The Nupe occupation===
Oyo had grown into a formidable inland power by the end of the 14th century. For over a century, the Yoruba state had expanded at the expense of its neighbors. During the reign of Onigbogi, Oyo suffered military defeats at the hands of the Nupe led by Tsoede.&lt;ref name="Stride292"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka p.&amp;nbsp;292&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime around 1535, the [[Nupe people|Nupe]] occupied Oyo and forced its ruling dynasty to take refuge in the kingdom of [[Borgu]].&lt;ref name="Oliver89"&gt;Oliver &amp; Atmore 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nupe sacked the capital, destroying Oyo as a regional power until the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="Thornton77"&gt;Thornton 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial period (1608–1800)==
The Yoruba of Oyo went through an interregnum of 80 years as an exiled dynasty after its defeat by the Nupe. They re-established Oyo as more centralized and expansive than ever. The people created a government that established its power over a vast empire.&lt;ref name="Oliver89"/&gt;  During the 17th century, Oyo began a long stretch of growth, becoming a major empire.&lt;ref name="Thornton77"/&gt; Oyo never encompassed all Yoruba-speaking people, but it was the most populous kingdom in Yoruba history.&lt;ref name="Alpern37"&gt;Alpern 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconquest and expansion===
[[File:WestAfrica1625.png|right|thumb|300px|Oyo Empire and surrounding states, c. 1625.]]
The key to Yoruba rebuilding of Oyo was a stronger military and a more centralized government. Taking a cue from their [[Nupe people|Nupe]] enemies (whom they called "Tapa"), the Yoruba rearmed with armor and cavalry.&lt;ref name="Oliver89"/&gt;  [[Oba Ofinran]], Alaafin of Oyo, succeeded in regaining Oyo's original territory from the Nupe.&lt;ref name="Stride292"/&gt; A new capital, Oyo-Igboho, was constructed, and the original became known as Old Oyo.&lt;ref name="Stride292" /&gt; The next oba, [[Eguguojo]], conquered nearly all of Yorubaland.&lt;ref name="Stride292"/&gt; After this, Oba [[Orompoto]] led attacks to obliterate the Nupe to ensure Oyo was never threatened by them again.&lt;ref name="Stride292"/&gt; During the reign of Oba, [[Ajiboyede]], he held the first Bere festival, an event to celebrate peace in the kingdom.  Celebrated regularly, it would retain much significance among the Yoruba long after the fall of Oyo.&lt;ref name="Stride292"/&gt;

Under his successor, [[Abipa]], the Yoruba repopulated Oyo-Ile and rebuilt the original capital.&lt;ref name="Stride292"/&gt; Despite a failed attempt to conquer the [[Benin Empire]] sometime between 1578 and 1608,&lt;ref name="Stride292"/&gt; Oyo continued to expand. The Yoruba allowed autonomy to the southeast of metropolitan Oyo, where the non-Yoruba areas could act as a buffer between Oyo and Imperial Benin.&lt;ref name="Stride296"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;296.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 16th century, the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] and [[Aja people|Aja]] states of modern Benin were paying tribute to Oyo.&lt;ref name="Stride293"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;293.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Dahomey Wars'''
The reinvigorated Oyo Empire began raiding southward as early as 1682.&lt;ref name="Thornton79"&gt;Thornton 1999, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of its military expansion, Oyo's borders would reach to the coast some {{convert|320|km}} southwest of its capital.&lt;ref name="Smith122"&gt;Smith 1989, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; It met little serious opposition until the early 18th century. In 1728, the Oyo Empire invaded the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in a major campaign of its cavalry.&lt;ref name="Thornton79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith48"&gt;Smith 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dahomey warriors, on the other hand, had no cavalry but many firearms. Their gunshots scared the Oyo cavalry horses and prevented their charging.&lt;ref name="Thornton82"&gt;Thornton 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;82.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dahomey's army also built fortifications such as trenches, which forced the Oyo army to fight as infantry.&lt;ref name="Thornton86"&gt;Thornton 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt; The battle lasted four days, but the Yoruba were eventually victorious after reinforcements arrived.&lt;ref name="Thornton86"/&gt;  Dahomey was forced to pay tribute to Oyo. The Yoruba invaded Dahomey seven times before finally subjugating the small kingdom in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Alpern 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;165.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Later conquest'''
With its cavalry, Oyo campaigned successfully in conquest and suppression over great distances. The Oyo army was able to attack defensive fortifications, but it was harder to supply an army, and they withdrew when supplies ran out.&lt;ref name="Thornton97"&gt;Thornton 1999, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Oyo did not use guns in its major conquests. The military waited until the 19th century to adopt them.&lt;ref name="Thornton97"/&gt; In 1764, a joint Akan (Akyem)-Dahomey-Oyo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Institue%20of%20African%20Studies%20Research%20Review/1973v9n1/asrv009001004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220084556/http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Institue%20of%20African%20Studies%20Research%20Review/1973v9n1/asrv009001004.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; force defeated an [[Empire of Ashanti|Asante]] army.&lt;ref name="Thornton79"/&gt;  The alliance victory defined borders between the neighboring states.&lt;ref name="Thornton79"/&gt;  Oyo led a successful campaign into [[Mahi people|Mahi]] territory north of Dahomey in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="Thornton79"/&gt; The Yoruba also used the forces of their tributaries; for instance, they accomplished a 1784 naval blockade of Badagri with an Oyo-Dahomey-Lagos force.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization===
At the beginning, the people were concentrated in metropolitan Oyo.  With imperial expansion, Oyo reorganized to better manage its vast holdings within and outside of Yorubaland. It was divided into four layers defined by relation to the core of the empire.&lt;ref name="Oliver95"&gt;Oliver &amp; Atmore 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; These layers were Metropolitan Oyo, southern Yorubaland, the Egbado Corridor and Ajaland.

Metropolitan Oyo corresponded, more or less, to the Oyo state prior to the Nupe invasion.&lt;ref name="Oliver95"/&gt;  This was the hub of the empire, where the Yoruba spoke the Oyo dialect.&lt;ref name="Stride296"/&gt; Metropolitan Oyo was divided into six provinces, with three on the west side of the [[Ogun River]] and three to the river's east.&lt;ref name="Stride296"/&gt; Each province was supervised by a governor appointed directly by the Alaafin of Oyo.&lt;ref name="Stride297"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;297.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Yorubaland'''
The second layer of the empire was composed of the towns closest to Oyo-Ile, which were recognized as brothers.&lt;ref name="Oliver95"/&gt;   This area was south of metropolitan Oyo, and its Yoruba inhabitants spoke different dialects from that of Oyo.&lt;ref name="Stride296"/&gt; These tributary states were led by their own rulers, titled Obas,&lt;ref name="Stride297"/&gt; who were confirmed by the Alaafin of Oyo.&lt;ref name="Stride297"/&gt;

*'''Egbado Corridor'''
The empire's third layer was the Egbado Corridor southwest of Yorubaland. This area was inhabited by the [[Egba people|Egba]] and [[Egbado]], and guaranteed Oyo's trade with the coast. The Egba and [[Egbado]] tributaries were allowed, like their Yoruba counterparts, to rule themselves. They were, however, supervised by Ajele.&lt;ref name="Oliver95"/&gt;  These were agents appointed by the Alaafin of Oyo to oversee his interest and monitor commerce. The lead representative of Oyo in the corridor was the Olu, ruler of the town of Ilaro.&lt;ref name="Smith122"/&gt;

*'''Ajaland'''
Ajaland was the last layer added to the empire.  It was the most restive and distant, and kept in line with threats of expeditions against it.&lt;ref name="Oliver95"/&gt;  This territory extended from the non-Yoruba areas west of the Egbado Corridor far into Ewe controlled territory in modern [[Togo]].&lt;ref name="Stride296"/&gt; This area, like all tributary states, was allowed a fair degree of autonomy as along as taxes were paid, the orders from Oyo were strictly followed, and access to local markets was provided to Oyo merchants.&lt;ref name="Stride293"/&gt; The Oyo often demanded tribute in slaves.  The tributary sometimes made war on other peoples to capture slaves for this.&lt;ref name="Alpern34"&gt;Alpern 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; Oyo punished disobedience by wholesale slaughter of the community, as it accomplished in [[Allada]] in 1698.&lt;ref name="Stride293"/&gt;

===Political structure===
The Oyo Empire developed a highly sophisticated political structure to govern its territorial domains. Scholars have not determined how much of this structure existed prior to the Nupe invasion. Some of Oyo's institutions are clearly derivative of early accomplishments in Ife. After reemerging from exile in the early 17th century, Oyo took on a noticeably more militant character. The influence of an aggressive Yoruba culture is exemplified in the standards placed on the oba (king) and the roles of his council.

====The Alaafin of Oyo====
The oba (meaning 'king' in the Yoruba language) at Oyo, who was referred to as the Alaafin of Oyo (Alaafin means 'owner of the palace' in Yoruba), was the head of the empire and supreme overlord of the people.&lt;ref name="Stride298"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;298.&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for keeping tributaries safe from attack, settling internal quarrels between sub-rulers, and mediating between those sub-rulers and their people.&lt;ref name="Stride298"/&gt;  The Alaafin of Oyo was also expected to give his subordinates honors and presents.&lt;ref name="Stride298"/&gt;  In return, all sub-rulers had to pay homage to the Oba and renew their allegiance at annual ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Stride297"/&gt; The most important of these was the Bere festival, marking the acclamation of successful rule by the Alaafin.&lt;ref name="Stride297"/&gt; After the Bere festival, peace in Yorubaland was supposed to last for three years.&lt;ref name="Stride297"/&gt; The king could not be disposed but could be asked to commit suicide if he is no more wanted. This is done by sending Bashorun (The warrior) to present an empty calabash  or a dish of parrot's egg to him and pass a sentence of rejection such as (Awon Eniyan Koo) meaning the people rejects you and also the gods reject you, by tradition, the Alaafin must poison himself and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/africa/2004/database/fasanya.html|title=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/africa/2004/database/fasanya.html|last=Fasanya|first=Akin|date=2004|website=The University of Texas at Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914094301/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/africa/2004/database/fasanya.html|archive-date=2017-09-14|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Selection of the Alaafin=====
The Oyo Empire was not a hereditary monarchy, nor an absolute one.&lt;ref name="Stride298"/&gt; The Oyo Mesi selected the Alaafin.  He was not always directly related to his predecessor, although he did have to be descended from Oranyan (also known as Oranmiyan), a son of Oduduwa (also known as Odudua, Odua ) and to hail from the Ona Isokun ward (which is one of the three royal wards).&lt;ref name="Stride298"/&gt;  At the beginning of the Oyo Empire, usually the Alaafin's oldest son succeeded his father to the throne. But, this sometimes led to the oldest son, i.e. the first-born prince, the Aremo, hastening the death of his father. Independently of the possible succession, the Aremo was quite powerful in his own right. For instance, by custom, the Alaafin abstained from leaving the palace, except during the important festivals, which in practice curtailed his power. By contrast, the Aremo often left the palace. This led noted historian S. Johnson to observe: "The father is the king of the palace, and the son the King for the general public".&lt;ref&gt;Church Missionary Society, G.31 A.2/1888-9, Letter of S. Johnson to the Rev. J.B. Wood, 8 November 1887, as cited by Law R., ''The Oyo Empire c. 1600-c. 1836'', p. 71 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; The two councils which checked the Alaafin had a tendency to select a weak Alaafin after the reign of a strong one to keep the office from becoming too powerful.&lt;ref name="Stride300"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;300.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Ilari=====
The Alaafin of Oyo appointed certain religious and government officials, who were usually [[eunuchs]].&lt;ref name="Stride_299"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;299.&lt;/ref&gt; These officials were known as the ''ilari'' or half-heads, because of the custom of shaving half of their heads and applying what was believed to be a magical substance into it.&lt;ref name="Smith12"&gt;Smith 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; The hundreds of Ilari were divided evenly among the sexes.&lt;ref name="Smith12"/&gt;  Junior members of the Ilari did menial tasks, while seniors acted as guards or sometimes messengers to the other world via sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Smith12"/&gt;  Their titles related to the king, such as ''oba l'olu'' ("the king is supreme") or ''madarikan'' ("do not oppose him").&lt;ref name="Smith12"/&gt;  They carried red and green fans as credentials of their status.&lt;ref name="Smith12"/&gt;

All sub-courts of Oyo had Ilari who acted as both spies and taxmen.&lt;ref name="Stride297"/&gt; Oyo appointed these to visit and sometimes reside in Dahomey and the Egbado Corridor to collect taxes and spy on Dahomey's military successes, so that the Alaafin of Oyo could get his cut.&lt;ref name="Smith10"&gt;Smith 1989, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar officials had existed in [[Ife]], as attested by terracotta art depicting them.&lt;ref name="Smith10"/&gt;

====The Councils====
While the Alaafin of Oyo was supreme overlord of the people, he was not without checks on his power. The Oyo Mesi and the Yoruba Earth cult known as [[Ogboni]] kept the [[Oba (king)|Oba]]'s power in check.&lt;ref name="Stride_299"/&gt;  The Oyo Mesi spoke for the politicians while The Ogboni spoke for the people backed by the power of religion.&lt;ref name="Stride300"/&gt;  The power of the Alaafin of Oyo in relation to the Oyo Mesi and Ogboni depended on his personal character and political shrewdness.

=====Oyo Mesi=====
{{more footnotes|date=April 2012}}
The [[Oyo Mesi]] were seven principal councilors of the state. They constituted the Electoral Council and possessed legislative powers, similar to today's [[United States Congress]]. Led by the Bashorun, acting as prime minister, and ran by the Agbaakin, Samu, Alapini, Laguna, Akiniku and Ashipa. They represented the voice of the nation and had the chief responsibility of protecting the interests of the empire. The Alaafin was required to take counsel with them whenever any important matter affecting the state occurs.&lt;ref name="WAfrica"&gt;Afolayan, Funso. (2000) "Kingdoms of West Africa", ''Africa Vol. 1'' ed. by Tony Falola, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Each man had a state duty to perform at court every morning and afternoon.  Each mesi had a deputy whom they would send to the Alaafin if his absence was unavoidable. The Oyo Mesi developed as a check on the Alaafin's power, preventing the Alaafin from being an [[autocracy|autocrat]]; the Oyo Mesi compelled many Afaafin to commit suicide during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="WAfrica" /&gt;

The head of the council of Oyo Mesi, the Bashorun, consulted the Ifa oracle for approval from the gods. New alaafins of Oyo were seen as appointed by the gods. They were regarded as ''Ekeji Orisa,'' meaning "companion of the gods." The Bashorun had final say on the nomination of the new Alaafin, his power rivaling the king himself. For example, the Bashorun orchestrated many religious festivals; in addition to being commander-in-chief of the army, which gave him considerable independent religious authority.

Chief among the responsibilities of the Bashorun was the all important festival of Orun. This religious divination, held every year, was to determine if the members of the Mesi still held favor with the Alaafin. If the council decided on the disapproval of the Alaafin, the Bashorun presented the Alaafin with an empty calabash, or parrot's egg as a sign that he must commit suicide. This was the only way to remove the Alaafin because he could not be legally deposed. Once given the parrot's egg, the Bashorun would proclaim, "the gods reject you, the people reject you, the earth rejects you." The Alaafin, his eldest son, and the Samu, his personal counselor and a member of the Oyo Mesi, the Asamu,&lt;ref name="WAfrica" /&gt; all had to commit suicide in order to renew the government all together. The process and suicide ceremony took place during the Orun festival.

=====The Ogboni=====
The Oyo Mesi does not enjoy an absolute power or influence, and while the Oyo Mesi may wield political influence, the Ogboni represented the popular opinion backed by the authority of religion, and therefore the view of the Oyo Mesi could be moderated by the Ogboni. There are checks and balances on the power of the Alafin and the Oyo Mesi and thus no one is arrogated absolute power. The Ogboni was a very powerful secret society composed of freemen noted for their age, wisdom and importance in religious and political affairs.&lt;ref name="Stride_299"/&gt; Its members enjoyed immense power over the common people due to their religious station. A testament to how widespread the institution was is the fact that there were Ogboni councils at nearly all sub-courts within Yorubaland.&lt;ref name="Stride_299"/&gt;  Aside from their duties in respect to the worship of the earth, they were responsible for judging any case dealing with the spilling of blood.&lt;ref name="Stride_299"/&gt; The leader of the Ogboni, the Oluwo, had the unqualified right of direct access to the Alaafin of Oyo on any matter.&lt;ref name="Stride_299"/&gt;

===Military===
There was a high degree of professionalism in the army of the Oyo Empire.&lt;ref name="Stride301"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;301.&lt;/ref&gt; Its military success was due in large part to its cavalry as well as the leadership and courage of Oyo officers and warriors.&lt;ref name="Stride301"/&gt; Because its main geographic focus was north of the forest, Oyo enjoyed easier farming and thus a steady growth in population.&lt;ref name="Stride301"/&gt; This contributed to Oyo's ability to consistently field a large force. There was also an entrenched military culture in Oyo where victory was obligatory and defeat carried the duty of committing suicide.&lt;ref name="Stride300"/&gt; This do-or-die policy no doubt contributed to the military aggressiveness of Oyo's generals.&lt;ref name="Stride300"/&gt;

====Cavalry====
The Oyo Empire was the only Yoruba state to adopt cavalry; it did so because most of its territory was in the northern savannah.&lt;ref name="Smith48"/&gt;  The origin of the cavalry is disputed; however, the [[Nupe people|Nupe]], [[Borgu]] and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] in neighboring territories also used cavalry and may have had the same historical source.&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;Law 1975, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Oyo was able to purchase horses from the north and maintain them in metropolitan Oyo because of partial freedom from the [[tsetse fly]].&lt;ref name="Stride302"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;302.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavalry was the long arm of the Oyo Empire. Late 16th and 17th century expeditions were composed entirely of cavalry.&lt;ref name="Smith48"/&gt;  There were drawbacks to this. Oyo could not maintain its cavalry army in the south but could raid at will.&lt;ref name="Thornton79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Why Nations Fail]]: The origins of power, prosperity and poverty.'' p. 254.  Acemoglu, Daron; Robinson, James A. 2012. {{ISBN|9780307719218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavalry in highly developed societies such as Oyo was divided into light and heavy.&lt;ref name="Smith48"/&gt; Heavy cavalry on larger imported horses was armed with heavy thrusting lances or spears and also with swords.&lt;ref name="Smith48"/&gt; Light cavalry on smaller indigenous ponies was armed with throwing spears or bows.&lt;ref name="Smith50"&gt;Smith 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Infantry====
Infantry in the region around the Oyo Empire was uniform in both armor and armament. All infantry in the region carried shields, swords and lances of one type or another.&lt;ref name="Thornton79"/&gt; Shields were four feet tall and two feet wide and made of elephant or ox hide.&lt;ref name="Thornton80"&gt;Thornton 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} heavy sword was the main armament for close combat.&lt;ref name="Thornton80"/&gt; The Yoruba and their neighbors used triple barbed javelins which could be thrown accurately from about 30 paces.&lt;ref name="Thornton79"/&gt;

====Structure====
The Oyo Empire, like many empires before it, used both local and tributary forces to expand its domains. The structure of the Oyo military prior to its imperial period was simple and closer aligned to the central government in metropolitan Oyo. This may have been fine in the 15th century when Oyo controlled only its heartland. But to make and maintain farther conquest, the structure underwent several changes.

=====The Eso=====
Oyo maintained a semi-standing army of specialist cavalry soldiers called the ''Eso'', the ''Esho'' or, formally, the [[Eso Ikoyi|Eso of Ikoyi]].&lt;ref name="Smith56"&gt;Smith 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt; These were 70 junior war chiefs who were nominated by the Oyo Mesi and confirmed by the Alaafin of Oyo.&lt;ref name="Smith56"/&gt; The Eso were appointed for their military skill without regard to heritage and were led by the Are-Ona-Kakanfo.&lt;ref name="Stride300"/&gt;  
	
After Oyo's return from exile, the post of Are-Ona-Kakanfo was established as the supreme military commander.&lt;ref name="Smith53"&gt;Smith 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;/ref&gt; He was required to live in a frontier province of great importance to keep an eye on the enemy and to keep him from usurping the government.&lt;ref name="Stride300"/&gt; During Oyo's imperial period, the Are-Ona-Kakanfo personally commanded the army in the field on all campaigns.&lt;ref name="Stride300"/&gt;

=====Metropolitan Army=====
Since the Are-Ona-Kakanfo could not reside near the capital, arrangements had to be made for the latter's protection in case of emergency. Forces inside metropolitan Oyo were commanded by the Bashorun, leading member of the Oyo Mesi.&lt;ref name="Smith53"/&gt; As stated earlier, Metropolitan Oyo was divided into six provinces divided evenly by a river. Provincial forces were thus grouped into two armies, under the ''Onikoyi'' and the ''Okere'' for the east and west side of the river respectively.&lt;ref name="Smith53"/&gt; Lesser war chiefs were known as Balogun, a title carried on by the soldiers of Oyo's successor state, [[Ibadan]].&lt;ref name="Smith57"&gt;Smith 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tributary Army=====
Tributary leaders and provincial governors were responsible for collecting tribute and contributing troops under local generalship to the imperial army in times of emergency.&lt;ref name="Stride296"/&gt; Occasionally, tributary leaders would be ordered to attack neighbors even without the backing of the main imperial army.&lt;ref name="Stride296"/&gt; These forces were often utilized in Oyo's distant campaigns on the coast or against other states.

===Commerce===
Oyo became the southern emporium of the Trans-Saharan trade. Exchanges were made in salt, leather, horses, kola nuts, ivory, cloth and slaves.&lt;ref name="Stride302"/&gt; The Yoruba of metropolitan Oyo were also highly skilled in craft making and iron work.&lt;ref name="Stride302"/&gt; Aside from taxes on trade products coming in and out of the empire, Oyo also became wealthy off the taxes imposed on its tributaries. Taxes on the kingdom of Dahomey alone brought in an amount estimated at 638 thousand dollars a year.&lt;ref name="Stride301"/&gt;

===Zenith===
[[File:Oyoxviii.jpeg|right|thumb|220px|Oyo Empire and surrounding states c. 1700.]]
By 1680, the Oyo Empire spanned over 150,000 square kilometers.&lt;ref name="Thornton104"&gt;Thornton 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt; It reached the height of its power in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Stride293"/&gt; And despite its violent creation, it was held together by mutual self-interest.&lt;ref name="Stride298"/&gt; The government was able to provide unity for a vast area through a combination of local autonomy and imperial authority.&lt;ref name="Stride301"/&gt;

Unlike the great savannah empires, of which Oyo may not be called a successor since it was a successor of Ife, there was little if any Muslim influence in the empire.&lt;ref name="Oliver95"/&gt;  It is known that at least some Muslim officials were kept in Metropolitan Oyo,&lt;ref name="Smith20"&gt;Smith 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt; and men capable of writing and calculating in [[Arabic]] were reported by French traders in 1787.&lt;ref name="Smith20"/&gt;

==Decline==
{{History of Benin}}
Many believe the decline of the Oyo empire had started as early as 1754 with the dynastic intrigues and palace coups sponsored by the Oyo [[Prime Minister]] [[Bashorun Gaha]]. Gaha, in his quest for absolute power, conspired with the Oyo Mesi and probably to some extent the Ogboni to force four successive Alaafins to commit ritual suicide after they had been presented with the symbolic parrot's egg. Between June and October 1754 alone, two Alaafins had been forced to commit suicide by Gaha.&lt;ref&gt;(PRO:T.70/1523)."Extract of letter of W. Devaynes, Governor of the English fort at Whydah, 22
Oct. 1754, quoted in letter of T. Melvil, Cape Coast Castle, 30 Nov. 1754". Public Records Office, London&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Alaafin Awonbijou spent 130 days on the throne, while Alaafin Labisi only spent 17 days on the throne Gaha's treachery was not ended until 1774 during the reign of Alaafin Abiodun, the fifth Alaafin he served with. Gaha was subsequently executed by Abiodun but the instability that had been brought about by these intrigues had further weakened and impoverished Oyo.

Alaafin Abiodun during his reign had also conducted failed campaigns against Borgu in 1783&lt;ref&gt;(PRO: T.70/1545). "Letter of Lionel Abson, Governor of the English fort at Whydah, 26 Sept. 1783" Public Records Office, London&lt;/ref&gt; and Nupe in 1789,&lt;ref&gt;Dalzel, Archibald. "The History of Dahomy, An Inland Kingdom of Africa" London,1793,p.229&lt;/ref&gt; losing the equivalent of 11 and 13 Generals and their men respectively. Abiodun was subsequently murdered by his own son Awole who subsequently ascended his father's throne.

The events that led to the secession of Ilorin began in 1793. Ilorin was a war camp headed by the Are-Ona Kakanfo Afonja. Afonja took cause with Awole when the latter had commanded him to attack Alaafin Abiodun's maternal home, Iwere-ile. Afonja being bound by an oath and also desirous not to fall under a curse from a previous Alaafin made to the effect that any Aare Ona Kakanfo who attacked Iwere-Ile (his paternal home) was to die miserably; this order Afonja ignored. Further cause was also given in 1795 when Awole again asked Afonja to attack the market town of Apomu which was a part of Ile-Ife. All Alaafins, due to the Yoruba belief that Ife was the spiritual home of the Yorubas, were made to swear an oath never to attack Ife.&lt;ref name=Akinjogbin&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awole eventually committed ritual suicide.&lt;ref name="Akinjogbin"/&gt;

After the death of Awole there was a scramble for the throne by numerous contenders; some were reported to have spent less than six months on the throne; there was also a period of interregnum of almost twenty years where the various factions could not agree on a candidate for the throne.&lt;ref name="Akinjogbin"/&gt; This period of vacuum led to the rise of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and others like the Otun to the Are-Ona Kakanfo, called Solagberu, and also Shehu Alimi, who was the leader of a growing Muslim population in Oyo. These new powers had lost regard for the office of the Alaafin due to the various political wranglings and the lack of a central authority at the time; this situation eventually led up to Afonja seceding Ilorin from Oyo in 1817 with the help of Oyo Muslims. In 1823, after Afonja had been killed by his allies, Shehu Alimi and Solagberu (Solagberu was also later killed by Alimi's son), Ilorin became part of the Sokoto Caliphate.&lt;ref name=Clapperton&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Captain Hugh Clapperton visited Oyo-Ile in 1825 during the reign of Alaafin Majotu, the empire was already in a state of decline. Clapperton's party recorded passing numerous Oyo villages burned by the Fulani (Ilorin) while Majotu had also sought the help of the English king and the Oba of Benin in putting down the Ilorin rebellion. Clapperton also noticed a shortage of horses, even though the Oyo were renowned as a great cavalry force; this might have something to do with the fact that most of the empire's soldiers and hence cavalry were stationed at Ilorin under the command of Afonja and later on Alimi's successors.&lt;ref name="Clapperton"/&gt;

Ilorin then besieged Offa and started raiding, burning and pillaging villages in Oyo, eventually destroying the capital Oyo-Ile in 1835.&lt;ref name="Akinjogbin"/&gt;

===Loss of the Egbado Corridor===
As Oyo tore itself apart via political intrigue, its vassals began taking advantage of the situation to press for independence. The Egba, under the leadership of [[Lishabi]], massacred the Ilari stationed in their area and drove off an Oyo punitive force.&lt;ref name="Stride296"/&gt;

===The Dahomey Revolt===
In 1823 Dahomey was reported to have raided  villages that were under the protection of Oyo for slaves due to the high demand for them. Oyo immediately demanded a huge tribute from King Gezo for the unauthorized incursion, to which Gezo dispatched his Brazilian agent, [[Francisco Félix de Sousa]], to the Alaafin at Oyo to make peace. The peace talks eventually broke down and Oyo attacked Dahomey.&lt;ref&gt;."Royal Gold Coast Gazette and Commercial Intelligencer" Cape coast, 1822-3&lt;/ref&gt; The Oyo army was decisively defeated, ending Oyo's hegemony over Dahomey.&lt;ref name="Alpern166"&gt;Alpern 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining its independence, Dahomey began raiding the corridor.&lt;ref name="Smith122"/&gt;

===The Fulani Jihad===
After Awole's rejection, Afonja, now master of [[Ilorin|Illorin]], invited an itinerant [[Fula people|Fulani]] scholar of Islam called [[Alim al-Salih]] into his ranks. By doing this, he hoped to secure the support of Yoruba Muslims  and volunteers from the Hausa-Fulani north in keeping Ilorin independent. Torn by internal struggle, Oyo could not defend itself against the Fulani.&lt;ref name="Stride303"&gt;Stride &amp; Ifeka 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;303.&lt;/ref&gt; Oyo-Ile was razed by the [[Fulani Empire]] in 1835 and the Oyo Empire collapsed in 1836.&lt;ref name="Alpern196"&gt;Alpern 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;196.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, the Illorin traditional ruler is an [[emir]], whereas in the rest of Yoruba towns the rulers are called ''oba'' or ''baale'' (Baale or Baba Onile meaning "father of the land" or "lord of the land").

===Ago d'Oyo===
After the destruction of Oyo-Ile, the capital was moved further south, to [[Ago d'Oyo]]. Oba Atiba sought to preserve what remained of Oyo by placing on Ibadan the duty of protecting the capital from the Ilorin in the north and northeast.&lt;ref name="Smith123"&gt;Smith 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to get the Ijaye to protect Oyo from the west against the Dahomeans.&lt;ref name="Smith123"/&gt;  The center of Yoruba power moved further south to [[Ibadan]], a Yoruba war camp settled by Oyo commanders in 1830.&lt;ref name="Smith48"/&gt;

===Final demise===
[[File:Aladin Oyo (when Arsmo).png|thumb|right|Alaafin Oyo c. 1910]]
Atiba's gambit failed, and Oyo never regained its prominence in the region.  Oba Atiba otherwise called Atiba Atobatele died in 1859; His son Adeyemi I and the 3rd Alaafin to rule in the present Oyo died in 1905. See [[List of rulers of the Yoruba state of Oyo]]. During the colonial period, the Yorubas were one of the most urbanized (living in city-like areas) groups in Africa. About 22% of the population lived in large areas with population exceeding 100,000 and over 50% lived in cities made up of 25,000 or more people. The index of urbanization in 1950 was close to that of the United States, excluding Ilorin. The Yoruba continue to be the most urbanized African ethnic group today. Old Oyo linked cities such as [[Ibadan]], [[Osogbo]], and [[Ogbomoso]], which were some of the major cities that flourished after the collapse.&lt;ref name="Bascom"&gt;Bascom 1962, pp.&amp;nbsp;699-709.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Greening Hewlett''' (February 12, 1923 – September 1, 2015) was an American [[public history|public]] historian best known for his work as the Chief Historian of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]].

==Biography==
Hewlett was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]], in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hewlett|first1=Richard G.|title=United States Public Records, 1970-2009|url=https://familysearch.org|publisher=familysearch|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, he attended [[Dartmouth College]], but after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] he enlisted in the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] doing work related to [[meteorology]]. With a number of other privates he attended [[Bowdoin College]] for a year, focusing on science. In June 1944, he did work relating to using [[radar]] to track [[weather balloon]]s, and eventually the military sent him to [[Harvard University]] to study in the electronics school. In early 1945, he was sent to Western China as a [[radiosonde]] operator, sending meteorological information by radio to U.S. forces, which used them in planning bombing raids on Japan. After the war, Hewlett attended [[graduate school]] in history at the [[University of Chicago]], though he never completed his undergraduate degree. He received his master's degree in 1948 and his PhD in 1952, writing his thesis on [[Lewis Cass]], a nineteenth-century [[Michigan]] politician.

While he was completing his dissertation, Hewlett accepted a position as an intelligence specialist in the [[United States Air Force]], examining open literature on factories in the [[Soviet Union]]. Hewlett found the job tedious and in 1952 leaped at the chance to be a program analyst in the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), compiling classified progress reports from all of the many branches of the AEC for the Commissioners. Hewlett later said that this job gave him a good general overview of the AEC and how it worked.

In 1957, Hewlett was contacted in order to find a historian to write an [[official history]] of the AEC, a pet project by Commissioner [[Lewis Strauss]]. Hewlett was unable to find any academic historians interested, however, in part because science and technology were generally not considered an interesting subject of historical study at the time. Because of his history backgrounds, Hewlett himself was offered the job, which he happily accepted, and became the first official historian of the AEC. Hewlett sought out another public historian, [[Kent Roberts Greenfield]], who was the Chief Historian of the [[United States Army]]. Greenfield encouraged Hewlett to establish an independent review board of academic historians who would serve as a buffer between Hewlett and the government bureaucrats who would inevitably object to certain portrayals of past U.S. government activities. Though he faced some initial resistance to the establishment of the [[Atomic Energy Commission's Historical Advisory Committee]], it was eventually approved by Strauss himself on the recommendation of one of Strauss's favorite academic historians.

Part of Hewlett's work in writing the AEC history was acquiring historical AEC records before they were destroyed, encouraging local AEC agencies and branches to think about their records in a historical manner, and marking historical records for depositing at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. Hewlett later recounted an incident in which he was called, as Chief Historian, to witness to opening of an old wartime filing cabinet found under a stairwell of an AEC building. After the locksmith had opened the cabinet, Hewlett reached in and the first document he pulled out was a letter signed by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. The cabinet turned out to be the wartime correspondence files of [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[James B. Conant]], and is currently considered one of the most important collections of documents relating to [[Manhattan Project]] history.

After going over thousands of secret and formerly secret records, Hewlett eventually produced his first volume of the official history, covering the time period of the Manhattan Project through the formation of the AEC. ''The New World, 1939-1946'' was published in 1962, and was a runner-up for the 1963 [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Hewlett continued his work and published the second volume, ''Atomic Shield, 1947-1952'' in 1969, which received the David D. Lloyd prize from the [[Harry S. Truman Library Institute]]. For both of these books, Hewlett was awarded the Distinguished Employee Award by the AEC, the highest employee award given by the agency.

According to a later interview with Hewlett, he had difficulty in getting the final book cleared for publication by the [[United States Navy]], because Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]] refused to allow it to be published unless Hewlett agreed to write an official history of the [[Nuclear Navy]] as well. Though irritated at the misuse of security clearances, Hewlett agreed and produced ''Nuclear Navy, 1946-1962'' in 1974. Despite his initial irritation, Hewlett enjoyed working on the project as he was given unfettered access to any related files on account of having Rickover's personal backing.

After the AEC was dismantled in 1974, Hewlett became the Chief Historian of its successor organization, the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] (ERDA). When ERDA itself was dismantled in 1977, his position was transferred to its successor, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. When the [[Three Mile Island]] accident occurred in 1979, Hewlett was asked to write a history of the event as it was unfolding. Hewlett was by then hoping to retire, however, and two other historians were recommended for the job, Philip L. Cantelon and Robert C. Williams. After the success by Cantelon and Williams in contracting themselves to the DOE, Hewlett, Cantelon, Williams, and Rodney P. Carlisle, then a visiting researcher at the DOE, together founded a private company devoted to writing commissioned official histories of government agencies, individuals, or private companies, named [[History Associates Incorporated]] and based in [[Rockville, Maryland]].

Hewlett later said that only one time he attempted to be involved in AEC/DOE policymaking, writing up a history of the AEC's policies in handling [[nuclear waste]], which he later said did not always portray the agency in a positive light. The document, completed in 1978, was essentially mothballed by the DOE and never followed up on.

Hewlett officially retired from government work in 1980 while he was still working on his third volume of AEC history. Because of institutional changes, Hewlett had difficulty getting the work approved for public release. Finally published in 1989 as ''Atoms for Peace and War, 1953-1961'', the book won the [[Richard W. Leopold Prize]] from the [[Organization of American Historians]] as the best book of the year on a U.S. [[federal government]] agency. He died September 1, 2015 at Maplewood Park Place, a senior living community in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary: Richard G.

Hewlett is today recognized as one of the most influential federal historians in the United States,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and was a founding member of both the [[Society for History in the Federal Government]] and the [[National Council on Public History]].

A '''shirtdress''' is a style of women's [[dress]] that borrows details from a man's [[Dress shirt|shirt]]. These can include a [[Collar (clothing)|collar]], a [[button]] [[Placket|front]], or [[cuff]]ed [[sleeve]]s. Often, these dresses are made up in crisp fabrics including [[cotton]] or [[silk]], much like a men's [[dress shirt]] would be. As they are typically cut without a [[Sewing|seam]] at the waist, these dresses often have a looser fit, usually relying on a [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] to define the waist. Button fronts and a forgiving fit make this a flattering look for most [[body types]].

==History==
[[File:Girl in Kensington 3.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|A vintage shirtdress, 1970s.]]
[[File:ERHW Porch1.jpg|thumb|upright|A modern form of shirt-dress.]]
Shirt dresses were sometimes called "shirtwaist dresses" when they were fashionable during the 1950s. The 1950s version of the shirtdress was launched as part of [[Christian Dior]]'s post–World War II "[[Christian Dior S.A.#The .22New Look.22|New Look]]" couture designs, with a full skirt held up by wearing a [[crinoline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hewitt, Valerie |author2=Ann Kellogg |author3=Lynn Payne  |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through American History, 1900 to the Present: Volume 1, 1900–1949|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33395-8|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often featured a notched collar, and elbow-length sleeves with cuffs. More informal versions of the shirtdress, made of cotton, but retaining the full skirt and collar, became a staple part of many women's wardrobes during the 1950s, with designers such as [[Anne Fogarty]] becoming known for their versions of this style.&lt;ref name=shirtdress&gt;''Popular Shirt Dress Combines Tailored Top with Ruffly Skirt'', ''Reading Eagle'', June 30, 1954, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; A 1957 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine includes a photo of a typical cotton shirtdress selling for $25 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |volume=42 |number=10 |issn=0024-3019 |title=Fashion: A Spree on 7th Avenue |newspaper=Life |date=11 Mar 1957 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the original shirtdress is the "'''T-shirt dress'''". T-shirt dresses began being produced in the 1960s, and are simply an elongated version of a T-shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cumming, Valerie |author2=C. W. Cunnington |author3=P. E.

==History==
The Siege of Gandesa or Second Battle of Gandesa was part of an attempt by the [[Spanish Republican Army]] to recapture lost territory following the [[Battle of the Ebro]], when six fully equipped republican divisions were able to successfully cross the [[Ebro River]]. The republican move initially caught the rebel faction by surprise, but the latter displayed greater logistic superiority and quickly brought in a convoy of troops from [[Lleida]], including ''[[Regulares]]'' [[shock troops]], the [[Spanish Legion]] and fanatical [[Falangists]] as reinforcements.&lt;ref name="grandes batallas"/&gt;

===The siege===
The attack against the Francoist troops entrenched in the town of Gandesa was mainly led by the 35th Division of the [[15th Republican Army Corps|15th Army Corps]] (''XV Cuerpo del Ejército''), led by [[Manuel Tagüeña]]&lt;ref name="Beevor, Antony 2006 p. 350"&gt;Beevor, Antony.

London. p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; Other divisions involved as the siege progressed were the 3d, 11th, 43d, 45th and 46th.&lt;ref name="grandes batallas"/&gt; Among the attackers the [[XV International Brigade]], who had led the [[Battle of Gandesa (1938)|Battle of Gandesa]] a few months before, also took part in what would be its last battle in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas (1976); p. 904 (Spanish edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

After its initial success, the ambitious republican offensive failed and the front stabilized in a line from [[Serra de Pàndols]] in the west through Gandesa and neighbouring [[Vilalba dels Arcs]], as far east as the [[Serra de Cavalls]] range and north to [[Serra de la Fatarella]]. Defended by the Nationalist 50th Division, the republican troops launched repeated attacks against Gandesa town, the wall of the local graveyard bearing the brunt of much of the combat action.&lt;ref name="grandes batallas"&gt;[http://www.grandesbatallas.es/batalla%20del%20ebro.html La Batalla del Ebro]&lt;/ref&gt;

Disregarding the advice of fellow generals García Valiño and Yagüe and Aranda who preferred to hold the front as it was and initiate an offensive in the North towards Barcelona, Franco wanted to regain the lost territory at any price. His plan was to keep ramming against the republican lines with repeated frontal counterattacks despite the heavy number of casualties on his own side. [[Antonio Aranda|General Aranda]] compared the lack of progress at Gandesa to a fruitless fight of two rams, but Franco concentrated on the fact that he had the best of the Republican Army caught up in a 35&amp;nbsp;km long line and if he annihilated it, there would be not enough manpower on the side of the Spanish Republic to continue the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Juan Eslava Galán]], ''Una historia de la Guerra Civil que no va gustar a nadie'', Planeta, p. 142-145&lt;/ref&gt;

After months of confrontation, on 2 November the nationalists dominated all the high points of the Pàndols and Cavalls ranges and by 10 November all republican positions south of the Ebro were abandoned in a hasty retreat. There were a very high number of casualties on both sides; the Nationalist armies could bear them, but the republican military would not recover from the heavy losses inflicted.&lt;ref name="grandes batallas"/&gt;

'''''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''''' is a book on human [[kinship]] and social behavior by Maximilian Holland, published in 2012. The work synthesizes the perspectives of [[evolutionary biology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]] towards understanding human social bonding and cooperative behavior. It presents a theoretical treatment that many consider to have resolved longstanding questions about the proper place of genetic (or 'blood') connections in human kinship and social relations, and a synthesis that ''"should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology"''.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;Philip Kitcher comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been called ''"A landmark in the field of evolutionary biology"''&lt;ref name=AV2014&gt;{{cite web | first = Augusto | last = Vitale | title = Review of ''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship'' | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 85 | year = 2014 | pages = 215 | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/365178}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ''"gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior"'',&lt;ref name=RF2012&gt;Robin Fox comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; ''"places genetic determinism in the correct perspective"''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt; and serves as ''"a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries."''&lt;ref name=SS2015&gt;{{cite web | first = Stuart | last = Semple| title = Review of: Holland, M (2012) Social bonding and nurture kinship: compatibility between cultural and biological approaches. | journal = Acta Ethologica | volume = | year = | pages = | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10211-015-0225-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the book is to show that ''"properly interpreted,  cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data)  and biological approaches are perfectly compatible regarding processes of social bonding in humans."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Pages 283-284&lt;/ref&gt; Holland's position is based on demonstrating that the dominant biological theory of social behavior ([[inclusive fitness]] theory) is typically misunderstood to predict that genetic ties are necessary for the ''expression'' of social behaviors, whereas in fact the theory only implicates genetic associations as necessary for the ''evolution'' of social behaviors. Whilst rigorous evolutionary biologists have long understood the distinction between these levels of analysis (see [[Tinbergen's four questions]]), past attempts to apply inclusive fitness theory to humans have often overlooked the distinction between ''evolution'' and ''expression''.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its central argument, the broader philosophical implications of Holland's work are considered by commentators to be that it both ''"helps to untangle a long-standing disciplinary muddle"''&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt; and ''"clarifies the relationship between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship."''&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hrdy comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that the book ''"demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs"''&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; and as a consequence, delivers ''"a convincing, solid and informed blow to the residual genetic determinism that still influences the interpretation of social behaviour."''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;

==Synopsis==

The book's form consists of a cumulative argument (using a wide range of supporting evidence) made over nine chapters, with each chapter ending in a brief retrospective summary, and the final chapter containing a recapitulation and summary of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;This synopsis is based mainly on the book's chapter summaries and concluding chapter&lt;/ref&gt; and drawing some wider conclusions.

===Continuing debate over 'blood kinship'===
{{See also|Kinship}}

Holland begins by tracing transitions in the history of anthropological theories of social behavior and [[kinship]], noting the varying importance with which 'blood ties' have been understood to be a necessary element of human kinship and social relations. He suggests that whilst the mounting [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] evidence has led to a move away from the 'blood kinship' concept in recent decades, many sociocultural anthropologists still query the connection between kinship and blood, reproduction or some other apparently biological functions. Meanwhile, many biologists, [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have persisted in viewing human kinship and cooperative behavior as necessarily associated with genetic relationships and 'blood ties'. The current situation has been characterized as "''a clash between incommensurate paradigms, holding as they may, completely incompatible ideas about human nature.''"&lt;ref&gt;Philip Thomas comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; Holland argues that a clear resolution to these questions is still outstanding, and would therefore be of value. In closing the introduction, Holland writes; "The approach  is not reductive. The claim is rather that a thorough investigation of the ‘biological facts’ can be useful mainly though allowing a change in focus... away from confusion about the place of genealogy in social ties, and onto a reformulated baseline, built around varied ''processual aspects of social bonding.''"&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary biology theory of social behavior===
{{See also|Inclusive fitness}}

The book reviews the background and key elements of [[W.D.Hamilton|Hamilton's]] [[inclusive fitness]] theory from the 1960s onwards, setting out its significant conceptual and heuristic value. Holland notes that Hamilton acknowledged that his earliest and most widely known account (1964)&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1964. The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7:1-52. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; contained technical inaccuracies. He also notes Hamilton's early speculations about possible proximate mechanisms of the expression of social behavior (''supergenes''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt; as a possible alternative to ''behaviour-evoking-situations''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt;) contained errors that have nevertheless remained very influential in popular accounts. Specifically, the supergenes notion (sometimes called the ''[[Green-beard effect]]'') - that organisms may evolve genes that are able to identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified and withdrawn by Hamilton in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the intervening years, the notion that supergenes (or more often, simply individual organisms) have evolved ''to identify genetic relatives and preferentially cooperate with them'' took hold, and became the way many biologists came to understand the theory. This persisted, despite Hamilton's 1987 correction. In Holland's view it is the pervasiveness of this longstanding but erroneous perspective, and the suppression of the alternative 'behaviour-evoking-situations' perspective regarding social expression mechanisms, that is largely responsible for the ongoing clash between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship.

===Sociobiology and kinship===

Holland shows that, in the 1970s and 80s, the first wave of attempts (known as ''human [[sociobiology]]'' or ''[[Darwinian anthropology]]'') to apply inclusive fitness theory to human social behavior relied on, and further reinforced, this same misinterpretation (above section) about the theory's predictions and the proximate mechanisms of social behavior. Holland also shows that this period of research was burdened with many misplaced assumptions about ''universal'' attributes of the human sexes, [[sexuality]] and [[gender]] roles, apparently projected from the ''specific cultural values'' of the researchers themselves. Holland also shows that, following the perceived failures of this early wave, and particularly its methodological agnosticism regarding proximate mechanisms of social behavior, the [[evolutionary psychology]] school grew up in its place. Although this latter school typically avoided engaging with the ethnographic data on human kinship, Holland argues that in the few cases where it did so, it repeated the misinterpretation of inclusive fitness theory that characterized the first wave. Holland also notes that [[Philip Kitcher|Kitcher]], in his&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, Philip. 1985. Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; critique of the sociobiological position, suggested that perhaps the expression of social behaviors in humans might quite simply be based on cues of context and familiarity, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.

===Proximate mechanisms and 'kin recognition'===
{{See also| Kin recognition}}

Chapters four and five investigate further the theory and evidence surrounding the ''proximate mechanisms'' of social behavior; specifically the question of whether social behaviors are expressed by organisms via ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' or via direct detection of actual genetic relatedness. Related questions have been the domain of [[kin recognition]] theory. Holland notes that the name 'kin recognition' itself suggests some expectation that a positive identification of genetic relatedness is a prediction of inclusive fitness theory, and is thus expected. Similar points have been made by others; "many behavioural ecologists seem to implicitly assume that specialised mechanisms allowing individuals to distinguish their kin from non-kin must have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tang-Martinez, Z. 2001. The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation. Behavioural Processes 53:21-40. Page 21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. 1990. Do animals really recognize kin? Animal Behaviour 39:42-54.&lt;/ref&gt;" Again, the possibility that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' might be the more parsimonious&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley. On page 420, Hamilton clearly states that ''"Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start.''"&lt;/ref&gt; mechanism of the expression of social behavior, and fully compatible with inclusive fitness theory, has often been underemphasized. However, Holland's review of the evidence notes that field studies in this area quickly established that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' do in fact overwhelmingly mediate social behaviours in those species studied, and that, particularly in mammal species, social bonding and familiarity formed in early developmental contexts (e.g. in burrows or nesting sites) are a common mediating mechanism for social behaviors, independently of genetic relatedness ''per se''. On the basis of the preceding theoretical analysis and review of evidence, at the end of chapter five, Holland argues that;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely erroneous, both in reference to theory and in reference to the evidence, to claim or suggest that 'the facts of biology' support the claim that organisms have evolved to cooperate with genetic relatives ''per se''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Primate social bonding and attachment theory===
{{See also| Attachment theory}}

Having argued for the above position on the lack of necessity for genetic relatedness ''per se'' to mediate social bonding and behavior, Holland suggests that "The further question then is; can we uncover in any greater detail how familiarity and other context-dependent cues operate?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;. To discover the extent to which the variety of human kinship behaviors may nevertheless be compatible with this (less deterministic) interpretation of biological theory of social behavior, Holland suggests that a survey of [[primate|primates']] most fundamental social patterns may give clues, especially those of species most closely connected with humans. The variety of primate [[mating system]]s, group-membership ('[[philopatry]]') patterns, and life-cycle patterns are reviewed. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other mammals, Catarrhini primate demographics are strongly influenced by ecological conditions, particularly density and distribution of food sources... Cohesive social groups and delayed natal dispersal mean that maternally related individuals, including maternal siblings, face a statistically reliable context of interaction in all Catarrhini primates. This reliable context of interaction with maternally related individuals is extended amongst those species with female philopatry (especially Cercopithecinae).&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with other social mammals, evidence suggest that the reliability of 'behaviour-evoking-situations' this social context provides has shaped the mechanisms of proximate expression of social bonding and behavior;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adoption of infants by females (and sometimes males) demonstrates that care-giving and bonding to infants is not mediated by positive powers of discrimination. From the infant's perspective, it will bond with any responsive carer. If not necessarily the actual mother, in natural conditions this will often be a maternal relative (particularly an older sibling), but the context is primary, not the actual relatedness. Similarly, social bonding and social behaviours between maternal siblings (and occasionally between other maternal relatives) is context-driven in primates, and mediated via the care-giver.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holland also notes how [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] and colleagues' [[attachment theory]] was strongly informed by primate bonding patterns and mechanisms, and that in Bowlby's later writing the then emerging [[inclusive fitness]] theory was explicitly linked to. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bowlby's] work demonstrated that social attachments form on the basis of provision of care, and responsiveness to elicitations for care. The social context of living together and the familiarity this brings, provides the circumstance within which social bonds can form...&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the basis of combining more recent primate research with the findings of attachment theory, Holland proposes that "In attempting to define more specific forms of ''the giving of care and nurture'' which may mediate social bonding we [find] that provision of food is likely to play a part, as well as the more intangible provision of warmth and comfort, and a safe base for sleeping.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;"

===Processual and nurture kinship in humans===
{{See also|Nurture kinship}}

Holland claims that, while biological theory of social behavior is not [[determinism|deterministic]] in respect of genetic relatedness vis-a-vis the formation of social bonds and expression of social behaviors, evidence does point to compatibility between a [[reductionism|non-reductive]] interpretation of the theory and how such bonds and behaviors operate in social mammals, primates and in humans. In the final part of the book, Holland explores the extent to which this perspective is also compatible with sociocultural anthropology's ethnographic accounts of human kinship and social behavior, both occasional accounts from the past, as well as more contemporary accounts that have explicitly eschewed the earlier 'blood ties' assumption. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many contemporary accounts focus on social bonds formed in childhood and the importance of the performance of acts of care, including food provision, in mediating these bonds. In all cases it is this performance of care which is considered the overriding factor in
mediating social bonds, notwithstanding 'blood ties'. In short, there is strong compatibility between the perspectives on social bonding that emerge from a proper account of biological theory and those documented by ethnographers.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Conclusion===

Holland's concluding chapter gives a summary of his fundamental position;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A crucial implication of this argument taken as a whole is that ''the expression of the kinds of social behaviours treated by inclusive fitness theory does not require genetic relatedness.'' Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology's claims that biological science predicts that organisms ''will'' direct social behaviour towards relatives are thus both ''theoretically'' and ''empirically'' erroneous. Such claims and their supporting arguments also give a highly misleading and reductive account of basic biological theory. Properly interpreted, ''cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data) and biological approaches are perfectly compatible'' regarding processes of social bonding in humans. Most of all, this requires a focus on the circumstances and processes which lead to social bonding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book notes that, as an outcome of the analysis, [[David M. Schneider|Schneider's]] sociocultural perspective on human kinship is vindicated;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do the biological facts have some priority or are they but one of the conditions, like ecology, economy, demography, etc., to which kinship systems must adapt? Take note: if the latter is the case, then kinship must be as much rooted in these other conditions as in the biological facts.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, David M. 1984. A critique of the study of kinship. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author supplies several examples of the insight that Schneider's broad approach can provide. The book closes with an example of a clash of cultural perspectives on kinship and family norms, and makes the suggestion that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Constructing from narrow cultural particulars (Euro-American or otherwise) an essentialised model of 'human nature' does not constitute science; it is closer to cultural colonialism. In any analysis intended to shed light on proposed universals of the human condition, reflexivity is essential, and cultural and biological approaches both surely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and reviews==

===General===
Kinship theorist and member of the [[national academy of science]], [[Robin Fox]] wrote of the work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An excellent and constructive discussion of matters in kinship and its cultural and biological components, handsomely reconciling what have been held to be incompatible positions.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Fox commentary, Fox's Website, http://robin-fox.com/books.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Holland gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior. If he had been in the debate in the 1980s then a lot of subsequent confusion could have been avoided"&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irwin Bernstein, distinguished research professor in the university of Georgia's ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences Program'' made the following comment on Holland's book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has demonstrated extraordinarily thorough scholarship in his exhaustive review of the often contentious discussions of kinship.  He has produced a balanced synthesis melding the two approaches exemplified in the biological and sociocultural behavioral positions. His work in reconciling opposing views clearly demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary approaches.  This should be the definitive word on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Bernstein comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Kitcher]], John Dewey Professor of Philosophy, and James R. Barker Professorship of Contemporary Civilization at [[Columbia University]], past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and inaugural winner of the Prometheus Prize, stated of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has provided a wide-ranging and deeply-probing analysis of the influence of genetic relatedness and social context on human kinship. He argues that while genetic relatedness may play a role in the evolution of social behavior, it does not determine the forms of such behavior. His discussion is exemplary for its thoroughness, and should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sociocultural anthropology===
Kirk Endicott, professor emeritus of [[anthropology]] at the university of Dartmouth, wrote that Holland's book was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A brilliant discussion of the relationship between kinship and social bonding as understood in evolutionary biology and in sociocultural anthropology. Among other contributions, it debunks the common misconception that biological evolution involves individual organisms actively pursuing the goal of increasing the numbers of their genes in successive generations, the measure of their so-called ‘individual inclusive fitness’. Holland demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janet Carsten, kinship theorist and professor of anthropology at the university of Edinburgh stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is a scholarly attempt to get beyond the often sterile oppositions between evolutionary and culturalist approaches to kinship. In bringing together two sides of the debate, it constitutes a valuable contribution to kinship studies.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Carsten comment, Author's website, |url=https://maximilianholland.com/2013/04/25/social-bonding-and-nurture-kinship-synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for the journal [[Critique of Anthropology]], Nicholas Malone concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lucid and effective... Holland has produced a significant work of scholarship that will be of interest to a wide swath of the anthropological community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Malone Review, Critique of Anthropology, DOI: 10.1177/0308275X15594535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting on the book for the journal [[Social Analysis]], Anni Kajanus found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Holland has done an excellent and thorough job in reviewing the disciplinary and interdisciplinary histories of approaches to kinship and social bonds in anthropology, biology, and psychology. Most importantly, he clarifies the different levels of analysis when looking at human behavior in real time and in the evolutionary time frame. This makes the book essential reading for anyone who acknowledges that human relatedness and social bonds are shaped by the
evolved dispositions of our species, their development through the life-course of an individual, and our specific cultural-historical environments... Holland’s book goes a long way toward clarifying and therefore advancing these theoretical debates&lt;ref&gt;Anni Kajanus Review, Social Analysis, web: http://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/social-analysis/60/3/sa600308.xml, DOI: 10.3167/sa.2016.600308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Biology===
An in-depth review of the book by [[primatology|primatologist]] Augusto Vitale, in the journal ''[[Folia Primatologica]]'', found that:
                                                                                                                                                                      &lt;blockquote&gt;This is, without a doubt, a very significant and important contribution to the on-going discussion about the determinants of sociality in humans as well as in other animals... A painstaking analysis of inclusive fitness, attachment theory and non-human primate social relationships, through a fascinating journey which ends with an anthropological account of social bonds in different cultures... It is a landmark in the field of evolutionary biology, which places genetic determinism in the correct perspective.&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stuart Semple, evolutionary anthropologist, reviewing the book in the journal ''[[Acta Ethologica]]'' stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As someone who teaches behavioural ecology to biologists, and primate biology to social and biological anthropologists, I will be strongly recommending this book to all of my advanced undergraduates, masters and PhD students, as well as to my colleagues. Not only does it help to resolve debates that have run for many years, but it is also an outstanding example of what can be achieved by immersing oneself in literature from different fields, while retaining an intellectual openness and exercising incisive analysis. Many of us talk enthusiastically about inter- and multi-disciplinarity, but often this is not much more than lip service. This book is a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries. There should be more texts like this.&lt;ref name=SS2015 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to praise for the book's significance, the [[Folia Primatologica]] review noted that the book is at times too dense and requires close reading;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument here and there becomes too detailed and tortuous, but it is absolutely captivating... [Colleagues] who are less used to extremely detailed theoretical reasoning, will find it difficult at the beginning...&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Stars virus''' is a [[computer virus]] which infects computers running [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was named and discovered by [[Iran]]ian authorities in April 2011. Iran claimed it was used as a tool to commit [[espionage]].&lt;ref name="Military.com"&gt;[http://www.military.com/news/article/iran-claims-hit-by-second-cyber-attack.html?wh=news Iran Claims Hit by Second Cyber Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehrnews.com"&gt;[http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1297506 Iran target of new cyber attack] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429014358/http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1297506 |date=2011-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Western researchers came to believe it is probably the same thing as the [[Duqu]] virus, part of the [[Stuxnet]] attack on Iran.

==History==

The Stars virus was studied in a laboratory in Iran&amp;nbsp;– that means major vendors of [[antivirus software]] did not have access to samples and therefore they could not assess any potential relation to [[Duqu]] or [[Stuxnet]].&lt;ref name="Military.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehrnews.com" /&gt; Foreign computer experts say they have seen no evidence of the virus, and some even doubt its actual existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/experts-sceptical-on-new-iran-cyber-attack-claim-398504.html|publisher=arabianbusiness.com|title=Experts sceptical on new Iran 'cyber attack' claim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFLDE74417H20110505|publisher=reuters.com|title=ANALYSIS-Experts skeptical on new Iran "cyber attack" claim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran is claiming Stars to be harmful for computer systems. It is said to inflict minor damage in the initial stage and might be mistaken for executable files of governmental organizations.&lt;ref name="Military.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehrnews.com" /&gt;

This is the second attack claimed by Iran after the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]] discovered in July 2010, which targeted [[Industrial engineering|industrial]] software and equipment.&lt;ref name="Mehrnews.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41097319/ns/us_news-the_new_york_times|publisher=msnbc.com|title=Israel tests on worm called crucial in Iran nuclear delay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers came to believe that the Stars virus found by Iranian computer specialists was the Duqu virus. The Duqu virus keylogger was embedded in a JPEG file. Since most of the file was taken by the keylogger only a portion of the image remained. It turned out to be an image taken by the Hubble telescope showing a cluster of stars, the aftermath of two galaxies colliding. Symantec, Kaspersky and CrySyS researchers came to believe Duqu and Stars were the same virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1l2YAwAAQBAJ |title=Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon |publisher=Crown Publishing Group |author=Kim Zetter |year=2014 |page=259 |accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;!--Search Inside on "stars attack"--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193243/The_Duqu_Saga_Continues_Enter_Mr_B_Jason_and_TVs_Dexter|publisher=securelist.com|title=The Duqu Saga Continues: Enter Mr. B.

{{Israel-Palestinian peace process}}
'''The Clinton Parameters''' ({{lang-he|מתווה קלינטון}}, ''Mitveh Clinton'') were guidelines for a permanent status agreement to resolve the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. They were proposed by then-[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]], following stagnating negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians from 19 to 23 December 2000. The Parameters were the compromises that Clinton believed to be the best possible within the margins of the positions of the two parties. The Clinton Parameters were meant to be the basis for further negotiations.

The proposal was presented on 23 December. On 28 December, the Israeli Government formally accepted the plan with reservations. In a meeting in the White House, on 2 January 2001, Yasser Arafat also officially accepted the parameters with reservations. The White House confirmed this the following day in a statement which said that ''"both sides have now accepted the president's ideas with some reservations."'' In 2005, Clinton wrote that he considered the Israeli reservations within the Parameters and the Palestinians' outside them. Others{{Who|date=July 2016}} argue that Clinton's parameters denied Palestinians what they were legally entitled to under international law,{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} specifically, sovereignty over the entirety of the [[West Bank]] and East Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees' right of return to Israeli territory they inhabited before 1948 and dismemberment of Israeli settlements on Palestinian West Bank territory.

== Background ==
The background for the Clinton's Parameters was the failure of the [[2000 Camp David Summit]], the following outbreak of the [[Second Intifada]] (''al-Aqsa Intifada''), [[Israeli prime ministerial election, 2001|the upcoming Israeli elections]], which polls indicated a possible defeat for then Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]], and the end of the Clinton presidency, in which Bill Clinton desired to end the eight years of peace efforts and Middle East arena in a successful note.

The negotiations, which were suspended on 25 July 2000, were resumed on 19 December at [[Bolling Air Force Base]] in Washington. On 21 December, President Clinton presented a plan for a final-status agreement on the basis of former talks. As the parties failed to reach an agreement, Clinton offered bridging proposals, later dubbed "the Clinton Parameters".&lt;ref name=DVR&gt;UN Division for Palestinian Rights, [https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/3790975C4E7E4084852569D6006553B3 "Monthly media monitoring review," December 2000] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104205003/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/3790975C4E7E4084852569D6006553B3 |date=2013-11-04 }}. Par. 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was drawn up by Israeli–Palestinian envoy [[Dennis Ross]], but represented discussions in September between Ross and the other members of his team—[[Aaron David Miller]], [[Gamal Helal]], Jon Schwartz, and [[Robert Malley]]. President Clinton was not consulted in creating the proposal.&lt;ref name="Ross2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Dennis|title=The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGRvlDWtCggC|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=2005-06-01|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-52980-2|page=725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Parameters ==
The (non-negotiable) ''Clinton Parameters'', to accept within four days as a condition for Clinton's proceeded support,&lt;ref name=JVL_MyLife&gt;JewishVirtualLibrary, [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/ClintonMyLife.html ''Bill Clinton Reflects on 2000 Camp David Summit'']. Quotes from President Bill Clinton's autobiography, ''My Life'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; were orally presented on 23 December 2000.&lt;ref name="parameters"&gt;The '''unofficial''' text of the Parameters: 1. ProCon, [http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.background-resource.php?resourceID=910 ''The Clinton Parameters'']; 2.

Some sources do not mention the three-year withdrawal period, contrary to Clinton's book ''My Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton proposed: A Palestinian state, including 94–96% of the West Bank; Israeli annexation of settlements in blocks,&lt;ref&gt;Note: The sources refer to them as blo'''ck'''s; usually they are called blo'''c'''s. Settlement blocs are groups of Israeli settlements, exclusive Jewish interconnecting roads and roads connecting them with Israel, together with expropiated and requisitioned land between.&lt;/ref&gt; with 80% of the current settler population; in East Jerusalem, Arab areas for the Palestinians and Jewish ones for the Israeli; temporary international and Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley and the long-term presence of 3 Israeli-controlled "early warning stations"; Palestinian sovereignty over its own airspace; return of refugees only to the Palestinian state, in principle. The Parameters did not mention [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] at all, but Clinton declared on 7 January 2001, that the Palestinian state would include the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/D57AFCDD6EB1445585256E37006655E4 ''President Clinton's "parameters" for a comprehensive agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, 7 January 2001'']. On unispal&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed percentage of the West Bank the Palestinians would get, however, was ambiguous, as the Israelis did not include the annexed areas in East Jerusalem, the no-man's land and the Palestinian part of the Dead Sea.&lt;ref name=PLO-response&gt;PLO-NAD, 1 January 2001, [http://www.nad-plo.org/etemplate.php?id=98 ''Official Palestinian Response to The Clinton Parameters (and letter to the international community)'']&lt;/ref&gt; This would decrease the Israeli offer some 5%.

=== The details ===
;Territory
The Clinton Parameters proposed a Palestinian state comprising between 94–96% of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip. Israel would annex the remaining land, which would include [[Israeli settlement]]s, containing 80% of the settler population, mainly in major ''settlement blocs''. Israel would cede 1–3% of land to the Palestinians in land swaps to compensate for the annexations. The Palestinian state would have to be contiguous, and annexed areas along with the number of Palestinians affected would be as minimized as possible.

;Jerusalem
According to the Parameters, Israel would gain sovereignty over the [[Western Wall]]. The Palestinians would gain sovereignty and Israel would gain "symbolic ownership" over the rest of the [[Temple Mount]], with both parties sharing sovereignty over the issue of excavations under the Temple Mount. [[East Jerusalem]] and its [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] would be divided according to ethnic lines, with Israel gaining sovereignty over Jewish settlements, and the Palestinians gaining sovereignty over Arab neighborhoods.

;Refugees
The Parameters required the Palestinians to waive their claim to an unlimited "right of return" to Israel proper, and Israel to acknowledge the "moral and material suffering caused to the Palestinian people by the 1948 war, and the need to assist the international community in addressing the problem". Under the Parameters, an international commission would be established to implement all aspects dealing with refugees as part of a permanent peace agreement. The Palestinian state would accept all refugees wishing to settle in its territory. The remaining refugees would be rehabilitated in their host countries, immigrate to third-party countries, and a limited number could settle in Israel if it agreed to accept them. Both sides would agree that [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194]] has been implemented.

;Security
The [[Israel Defense Forces]] would withdraw within 36 months and gradually be replaced by an international force. Israel would retain a small military presence in fixed locations in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] under the authority of the international force for another 36 months. This period could be reduced in the event of the diminishing of regional threats to Israel. Israel would also maintain three radar facilities in the West Bank (Early Warning Stations, EWS). These facilities would have a Palestinian liaison and would be subject to review after every ten years, with any changes in their status to be mutually agreed by both parties.

The Palestinian state would gain sovereignty over its own airspace, with special reservations for Israeli training and operational needs. The Palestinian state would also be defined as a "non-militarized state", and would not possess conventional military forces, but would be allowed to have a "strong security force". The Palestinian state would also have an international force for border security and deterrence.

In the event of a military threat to Israel's national security requiring a state of emergency, Israel would be allowed to deploy military forces to certain areas and routes, according to a pre-drawn map. International forces would have to be notified prior to any such deployments.

;End of the Conflict
The Parameters required that this agreement put an end to the conflict and any other claims. This could be implemented through a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution]] declaring that Resolutions [[Resolution 242|242]] and [[Resolution 338|338]] have been implemented.

==Acceptance and reservations==
On 3 January 2001, the White House released an official statement which stated that both sides had accepted the President's parameters with reservations.&lt;ref name=USEmbassy&gt;Embassy of the United States, Israel, 3 January 2001, [http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/peace/archives/2001/january/me0103b.html ''Excerpts: State Dept. spokesman on Mideast peace prospects (Both sides accept Clinton's parameters with reservations)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721145451/http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/peace/archives/2001/january/me0103b.html |date=2011-07-21 }}.

Moreover, the Israelis demanded a route between East Jerusalem and the Jordan River&lt;ref name=DVR/&gt; (to pass by a tunnel or bridge, providing "contiguous" territory&lt;ref name=Barak-interview_Morris&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/jun/13/camp-david-and-after-an-exchange-1-an-interview-wi/ ''Camp David and After: An Exchange (1.

On [http://www.nybooks.com/issues/2002/jun/13/]&lt;br /&gt;''"But in the West Bank, Barak says, the Palestinians were promised a continuous piece of sovereign territory except for a razor-thin Israeli wedge running from Jerusalem through from Maale Adumim to the Jordan River. Here, Palestinian territorial continuity would have been assured by a tunnel or bridge"''&lt;/ref&gt;) and probably an additional one from Ariel, which would cut the West Bank into pieces. On the other hand, from the Palestinian reservations, only the refugee point seemed fundamental.&lt;ref name=Pressman_visions&gt;Jeremy Pressman, ''International Security'', vol 28, no. 2, Fall 2003, p. 20-21, [http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/pressman.pdf ''"Visions in Collision: What Happened at Camp David and Taba?"''].

=== Israel ===
The Parameters received a mix of support and criticism within Israel, with some in the Israeli government, as well as the Mayor of [[Jerusalem]] opposing them. There were also fears that the Parameters would not be approved in a public referendum, and that the Palestinians might violate their terms of the agreements.

Despite some provisions on [[Jerusalem]] being contrary to the election promises of Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]], the Parameters received wide support in the [[Twenty-eighth government of Israel|Israeli cabinet]], which voted early on 28 December with 10 votes to 2 to accept them, but with reservations and on condition the Palestinians would accept them as well. Only Cabinet Minister [[Roni Milo]] resigned over his objection to the Cabinet's approval of the plan.&lt;ref name=DVR/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN_271200&gt;CNN, 27 December 2000, [http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/12/27/mideast.06/ "Mideast summit in Egypt called off"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December, Barak declared that Israel had accepted Clinton's proposals, but will not accept the Palestinian right of return to Israel and sovereignty over the Temple Mount.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 31 December 2000, [http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2000/Pages/PM%20Barak-%20Israel%20has%20proven%20its%20commitment%20to%20peac.aspx ''PM Barak: Israel has proven its commitment to peace'']&lt;/ref&gt; Although he chose to accept the plan, Barak sent Clinton a 20-page letter of "reservations". The two main points were that he "would not sign any document that transfers sovereignty on the Temple Mount to the Palestinians", and that "no Israeli prime minister will accept even one refugee on the basis of the right of return."&lt;ref&gt;Ari Shavit, [http://www.haaretz.com/continuation-of-eyes-wide-shut-1.35091 ''Continuation of Eyes wide shut''] (interview with Ehud Barak). ''Haaretz'', 4 September 2002. ([http://www.haaretz.com/eyes-wide-shut-1.35090 ''Eyes wide shut''])&lt;/ref&gt; Minor reservations were also made with regard to security arrangements, deployment areas, and control over passages. In a phone conversation with Clinton, Prime Minister Barak also demanded that Israel be allowed to retain sovereignty over the "sacred basin"—the whole area outside the Old City that includes the [[City of David]] and the Tombs of the Prophets on the road to the [[Mount of Olives]], which was not mentioned in the Parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Swisher, Clayton: ''The Truth about Camp David: The Untold Story about the Collapse of the Middle East Peace Process''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palestinians ===
In a letter of 27 December 2000, Arafat asked for some clarification of the proposals:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Letter from Arafat to Clinton, 27 December 2000|''Letter from Arafat to Clinton, 27 December 2000'']]. On Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. President, please allow me address you with all the sincerity emanating from the close friendship that ties us, and the historical importance of what you are trying to do. I want to assure you of my will to continue to work with you to reach a peace agreement. I need your help in clarifying and explaining the basis of your initiative.

I need clear answers to many questions relating to calculation of land ratios that will be annexed and swapped, and the actual location of these territories, as well as the basis for defining the Wailing Wall, its borders and extensions, and the effect of that on the concept of full Palestinian sovereignty over al-Haram al-Sharif.

We understand that the idea of leasing additional territory is an option we have the right to reject, and is not a parameter of your bridging proposals. We also presume that the emergency Israeli locations are also subject to negotiations and to our approval. I hope that you have the same understanding.

I have many questions relating to the return of refugees to their homes and villages. I have a negative experience with the return of displaced Palestinians to the West Bank and Gaza during the Interim Period. Because the modalities remained tied to an Israeli veto, not one refugee was allowed to return through the mechanism of the interim agreement, which required a quadripartite committee of Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Palestine to decide on their return. Equally, I don't see a clear approach dealing with compensation of the refugees for their land, property and funds taken by Israel under the aegis of the Israeli custodian of absentee property.

I feel, Mr. President, that the period for Israeli withdrawal specified in your initiative is too long. It will allow the enemies of peace to exploit the time to undo the agreement. I wonder if the "Period" is one of the fixed parameters of your proposal; a "basis" that cannot be changed.

Mr. President, I have many questions. I need maps, details, and clarifications that can help me take the necessary decisions with my leadership and people.

I would like you to appreciate that I do not want to procrastinate or waste time.

We need a real opportunity to invest once more your determination and creativity to reach a fair and lasting peace with you efforts and during your presidency.

I remain, Mr. President, ready to pay you a visit at the White House, in the shortest possible time if you find this visit appropriate, to discuss with you the bridging proposals and to exchange views on ways to develop them further.

Please accept my highest regards and best wishes,

Yasser Arafat
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Clayton Swisher,&lt;ref name=CS-CP2&gt;{{cite book|last=Swisher|first=Clayton|title=The Truth About Camp David: The Untold Story About the Collapse of the Middle East Peace Process|year=2004|publisher=Nation Books|pages=399|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5INKlOqNeAC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arafat's letter "puncture[s] yet another myth of Palestinian rejectionism ... that Israel accepted [the parameters] while the Palestinians rejected them... Ross diligently spread this fairy tale, as did the president himself."

A summit with Arafat and Barak the next day in Egypt was cancelled.&lt;ref name=DVR/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN_271200/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTÉ"&gt;RTÉ, 28 December 2000, [http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/1228/11199-mideast/ "Arafat and Mubarak hold 'constructive' talks on peace proposals"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN_Pal-letter&gt;CNN, 27 December 2000, [http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/12/27/mideast.04/index.html?_s=PM:WORLD "Palestinians ask for more details on U.S. peace proposals"]&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January, the Palestinian Negotiating Team (NAD) published an open letter, explaining why the proposals would ''"fail to satisfy the conditions required for a permanent peace"''. They claimed that the parameters divided the Palestinian state, including East Jerusalem, into separate cantons and unconnected islands, and protested the surrender the right of return of Palestinian refugees and lack of clarity and details. Clinton's proposal was not accompanied by a map; only the Israelis presented a map, which would allegedly render the Palestinian state unviable and lacking direct access to international borders. The Palestinians opposed the Israeli annexation of settlement blocs in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which they claimed subordinated the contiguity of the Palestinian state. They also protested that Israel would gain control over their natural resources, and was planning on ceding them less valuable land on the outskirts of West Bank and Gaza in exchange.&lt;ref name=PLO-response/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS-CP399&gt;{{cite book|last=Swisher|first=Clayton|title=The Truth About Camp David: The Untold Story About the Collapse of the Middle East Peace Process|year=2004|publisher=Nation Books|pages=399|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-uwK1BBWE0C&amp;pg=PR3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Arafat flew to Washington to meet with President Clinton, the newspaper ''[[Al-Ayyam (Ramallah)|Al-Ayyam]]'' published in Arabic a letter to Clinton with the Palestinian reservations.&lt;ref name=Arafats_reservations&gt;An English translation of the letter, which reflects the open NAD letter: [http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=778 ''MEMRI: Arafat's Letter of Reservations to President Clinton''], IMRA, 11 January 2001; [http://www.memri.org/report/en/print407.htm Also on MEMRI]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 January 2001, at a meeting in the White House, Arafat gave his qualified agreement to the Parameters with reservations. In a memorandum, his Negotiations Support Unit (NSU) had warned him ''"that the proposals in general are too vague and unclear to form an acceptable framework for an agreement"''.&lt;ref name=PP_NSU-memo&gt;Palestine Papers, 2 January 2001, [http://transparency.aljazeera.net/files/120.PDF ''Memorandum'']. On [http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/20121821232131550.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiation team opposed the use of percentages. First, the Israelis were to make clear which reasonable needs they had in specific areas; without a map, the percentages given were also ambiguous, as the Israelis did not include all disputed land or part of the Dead Sea, and it was unclear where the 80% proportion of settlers would remain. All Israeli settlers taken together occupied around 1.8% of the West Bank. The Palestinian concerns about lack of contiguity were largely related to Israeli control over large swaths of land in key development areas such as Jerusalem and Bethlehem, due to the large settlement blocs. Palestinians would be unable to move without restriction within their own state.&lt;ref name=PP_NSU-memo/&gt;

A PLO website gives further comments on the Parameters.&lt;ref&gt;PLO-NAD, [http://www.nad-plo.org/etemplate.php?id=76 ''Summary - Negotiation and the peace process'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian position about the right of return was, as it has always been, that it is an individual universal right which can never be set aside. This right they see acknowledged in [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN resolution 194]].&lt;ref name='PP_q&amp;a'&gt;Palestine Papers, 22 April 2001, [http://transparency.aljazeera.net/files/67.PDF ''NSU: Possible Questions &amp; Answers to Camp David'']; see par. 16. On [http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/201218212040234681.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==

A 25 December published poll found that 48% of the 501 Israelis questioned were opposed to the proposals; 57% would object to Palestinian control of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound; 72% were against even a limited return of Palestinian refugees to Israel. A 29 December published poll found that 56% of the Israelis would oppose a peace agreement reached on the basis of the Parameters.&lt;ref name=DVR/&gt;

A poll carried out in 2011 by the Hebrew University indicated that a growing number of Palestinians and Israelis supported a settlement to the conflict based on the Parameters. The poll found that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians supported a two-state solution based on the Clinton Parameters, compared with 47% of Israelis and 39% of Palestinians in 2003, the first year the poll was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=251311 | title=Support growing for two-state solution | publisher=Jerusalem Post | date=2011-12-28 | accessdate=10 February 2012 | author=Lidman, Melanie | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903152656/http://www.jpost.com/diplomacyandpolitics/article.aspx?id=251311 | archivedate=3 September 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Additional attempts to reach a compromise at the [[Taba Summit]] were unsuccessful, although some progress was made. In Israel, the Prime Minister's opponents claimed that his government lacked the support of the Israeli public, the [[Knesset]] (Israeli parliament) and the polls, and that he was submitting Israel to a "liquidation sale".

The '''World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition''' was an open, international memorial contest, initiated by the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] (LMDC) according to the specifications of architect [[Daniel Libeskind]], to design a World Trade Center Site Memorial (later renamed the [[National September 11 Memorial]]) on a portion of the [[World Trade Center site]].  The competition began April 28, 2003 and the winner—[[Michael Arad]] and [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|Peter Walker]]'s ''[[Reflecting Absence]]''—was revealed January 14, 2004 in a press conference at [[Federal Hall National Memorial]] in New York City.  The contest garnered 5,201 entries from 63 nations and 49 U.S. states, out of 13,683 registrants from all 50 U.S. states and 94 nations, making it the largest design competition in history.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
[[File:skylineview.jpg|thumb|A skyline view]]

On March 5, 2002, [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[George Pataki]], [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]], and the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] (LMDC) jointly announced plans for an interim memorial to the victims [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]] and [[World Trade Center bombing|February 26, 1993 World Trade Center attacks]].

On January 2, 2003, LMDC and [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] announced that a series of public meetings would take place to discuss a future World Trade Center Site Memorial.

The [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition#Selection jury|Selection Jury]] for the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition were announced  on April 10. The Competition began on April 28, when the [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition#Guidelines|Guidelines]] were released, Registration was opened. The LMDC accepted questions from competitors between April 28 and May 18, which were answered on its website on May 23 and removed at the end of the competition. Potential entrants were given until May 29 to register for the stated purpose of gauging the volume of entires. On May 15, the LMDC announced that it had received registrants from all 50 US states and 70 other nations; on May 30, the LMDC announced that 13,683 competitors had registered from 94 nations.

Submissions were accepted from registered entrants between June 9 and 30. On July 17, the LMDC announced that 5,201 submissions had been received, representing competitors from 49 U.S. states and 63 nations. The LMDC displayed the 8 finalists in the [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] on November 19.

On January 6, 2004, the Selection Jury named [[Michael Arad]] and [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|Peter Walker]]'s "[[Reflecting Absence]]" as the winning design, which was displayed publicly January 14.

On February 19, 2004, all 5,201 entries on its website were made available on the LMDC's website. On April 8, the LMDC announced the creation of an Advisory Committee to ensure that the Competition Guidelines are incorporated into the final design, which had undergone revision since January 14. On April 13, the LMDC announced that associate architect [[Davis Brody Bond]] would assist Arad and Walker with their final design.

The online searchable archive of entries still exists [http://www.wtcsitememorial.org/submissions.html], now under the auspices of the Memorial/Museum. The archive has only been reviewed in its entirety once for research [911memorialvisions.com].

==Guidelines==
There were five required "program elements":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition Guidelines|url=http://wtcsitememorial.org/about_guidelines.html|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recognize each individual who was a victim of the September 11, 2001 and February 26, 1993 attacks
* Provide an area for quiet visitation and contemplation
* Provide an area for the families and loved ones of victims
* Provide a separate accessible space to serve as the final resting-place for the unidentified remains from the World Trade Center Site
* Make visible the footprints of the original World Trade Center Towers

In addition, entrants were expected to conform to the following "guiding principles":

* Embody the goals and spirit of the mission statement
* Convey the magnitude of personal and physical loss at this location
* Acknowledge all those who aided in rescue, recovery, and healing
* Respect and enhance the sacred quality of the overall site and the space designed for the memorial
* Encourage reflection and contemplation
* Evoke the historical significance of the worldwide impact of September 11, 2001
* Create an original and powerful statement of enduring and universal symbolism
* Inspire and engage people to learn more about the events and impact of September 11, 2001 and February 26, 1993
* Evolve over time

Entries were examined by "LMDC staff" prior to jury review to determine whether they met the competition requirements.  Although the Jury was allowed to review the list of ineligible submissions, the LMDC itself was to make the final determination.

==''Reflecting Absence''==&lt;!--The italics are purposely placed in the hatnote--&gt;
{{main|National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum#Design{{!}}National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum}}
[[Michael Arad]] and [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|Peter Walker]]'s ''Reflecting Absence'' consists of a field of trees interrupted by two large voids containing recessed pools, marking the footprints of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]]. The [[deciduous]] trees (swamp white oaks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.911memorial.org/selecting-trees 9/11 Memorial – Selecting Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;) are arranged in rows, forming informal clusters, clearings and groves. The park is at street level, sitting above the Memorial Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.911memorial.org/plaza-details-0 9/11 Memorial – Plaza Details]&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Trade Center site is a [[The Bathtub|bathtub]], as the area was excavated to construct the original World Trade Center and the earth was used to build [[Battery Park City]], a neighboring residential community.

The names of the victims of the attacks (including those from [[the Pentagon]], [[American Airlines Flight 77]], and [[United Airlines Flight 93]]) and the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|1993 bombing]] are inscribed on the [[parapet]]s surrounding the waterfalls,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.911memorial.org/names-arrangement 9/11 Memorial – Names Arrangement]&lt;/ref&gt; in an arrangement based on "meaningful adjacencies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2011/05/16/110516ta_talk_paumgarten The New Yorker – Dept. of Remembering – The Names]&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the [[slurry wall]] (approximately half of what [[Daniel Libeskind]] originally wanted to preserve&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/architecture/reviews/n_9348/ New York – Disappearing Act]&lt;/ref&gt;), originally designed to hold back the [[Hudson River]], will be maintained in the Museum.

'''Zakariyyā al-Ansārī''' was a leading Islamic scholar of the 15th century. He was born in or around 1420 CE, in [[Sunaika]], located in the Egyptian province of [[Sharqiyya]].&lt;ref name=drewes&gt;{{cite book|last=Drewes|first=Gerardus Willebrordus Joannes|title=Directions for travellers on the mystic path: Zakariyyā al-Anṣārī's Kitāb fatḥ al-raḥmān and its Indonesian adaptations: with an appendix on Palembang manuscripts and authors|year=1977|publisher=Nijhoff|location=The Hague}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} During his adolescence, al- Ansārī moved to Cairo to study at [[al-Azhar University]]. He lived in such poverty there, that he would venture out into the night in search of water faucets and the rinds of watermelon.&lt;ref name=drewes/&gt;{{rp|31}}  However, according to al-Ansārī’s own account, after a few years at al-Azhar, a mill worker came to his aid. He provided the young al-Ansārī with money for his food, clothing and books. al-Ansārī told of a remarkable encounter with his benefactor told him,
{{quote|Zakariyyā, you will live to see all of your peers die, and your prestige will rise, and for many years you will occupy the highest post of Islam, and your students will become the shaykhs of Islam during your lifetime – when you go blind.&lt;ref name=drewes/&gt;{{rp|31}} }}

Eventually, this foretelling would prove to be accurate. While a student, al- Ansārī studied under al-Qāyāti, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalāni]], [[Jalāl al-Dīn al Mahallī]] and [[Sharaf al-Din al Munawi]].&lt;ref name=drewes/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Zakariyyā al-Ansārī held the office of [[Shāfi’ī]] [[qādī]] for a twenty-year period during the reign of [[Qā’it Bey]]. Over the course of his lifetime, al-Ansārī spent eighty years engaged as a teacher and muftī. One of al-Ansārī students was al-Sha’rānī, who was responsible for much of the information that survives in regards to the life of al-Ansārī. Of his teacher, al-Sha’rānī wrote that al-Ansārī was, "a pillar of the fiqh and the tasawwuf".&lt;ref name=drewes/&gt;{{rp|30}}

Al-Ansārī held several teaching positions over the course of his life, which included professorships at the madrasa of the mausoleum of al-Shāfī and the madrasa Jāmaliyya.&lt;ref name=drewes/&gt;{{rp|29}} Fifty-two writings are listed under al-Ansārī’s name in Brockelmann's Geschichte der Arabischen Litteratur. These writings include, but are not limited to, topics of logic, grammar, philosophy, scientific terminology, rhetoric, [[Qur’an]]ic [[exegesis]], Holy Tradition, the life of Muhammad, jurispridence (''[[fiqh]]''), dogma and mysticism.&lt;ref name=drewes/&gt;{{rp|27}} Some of al-Ansārī’s most famous works include: Manhaj al-tullab (“The Way of the Students”), Fath al-Wahhab (“The help of the Bountiful”), Tuhfat al-tullāb (“The Gift offered to the Students”), Lubb al-usul (“The Kernel of the Science of the roots”), and his commentary on al-Qushairī’s Risāla fī ‘l-tasawwuf.&lt;ref name=drewes/&gt;{{rp|27}}

From an early age, Zakariyyā al-Ansārī was attracted to [[Islamic mysticism|mysticism]]. So encompassing was his interest, that al-Ansārī claimed no one expected much of anything from him in the way of legal studies.&lt;ref name=drewes/&gt;{{rp|31}}  Al-Ansārī studied, and was initiated as a Sufi under Muhammad al-Ghamrī.&lt;ref name=khan89&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=I.K.|title=Islam in Modern Asia|year=2006|publisher=MD Publications|location=New Delhi|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several treaties on Sufism, but al-Ansārī is especially well known for his commentary on al-Qushairī’s Risāla fī ‘l-tasawwuf. In this commentary he defines [[tasawwuf]] in a number of ways, complete earnestness in the progression towards the King of all kings;… it is the devotion to works of good and the avoidance of defects."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnah.org/tasawwuf/scholr32.htm |title=tasawwuf al-Ansari |publisher=Sunnah.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of al-Ansārī’s Sufi legacy, his name is also remembered in connection to his student [[al-Sha’rānī]]. Al-Sha’rānī established [[Neo-Sufism]], also known as the "middle course". Neo-Sufism combines tasawwuf and fiqh.&lt;ref name=khan89 /&gt;

Al-Ansārī died in 1520, in Cairo, at the age of 100. He was given the honorary title "Shaikh al-Islam" and is known for the legacy of his mystic and legal writings. Al-Ansārī gained fame especially in Indonesia and Malaya due to his frequent mention as a source for Malay writers.&lt;ref name=drewes/&gt;{{rp|27}} His commentaries on the Sahih of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], [[Abhari]]’s adaptation of [[Isagoge]], [[al-Jazari]]’s tajwid and his Futuhat al-ilahiyya on mysticism are among Ansārī’s most popular texts in Indonesia.
