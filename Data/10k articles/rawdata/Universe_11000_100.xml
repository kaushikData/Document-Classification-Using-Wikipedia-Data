The '''1934 Swissair Tuttlingen accident''' occurred on 27 July 1934 when a [[Swissair]] [[Curtiss AT-32C Condor II]] aircraft crashed near [[Tuttlingen]], [[Germany]] while flying through a [[thunderstorm]], killing all 12 people on board.  It was the worst air crash in 1934&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?Year=1934 |title=1934 occurrences |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=aviation-safety.net |publisher=[[Flight Safety Foundation]] |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Swissair's first aviation accident since its foundation in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/dblist.php?sorteer=datekey_desc&amp;kind=%&amp;cat=%&amp;page=1&amp;field=Operatorkey&amp;var=5224 |title=Swissair occurrences |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=aviation-safety.net |publisher=[[Flight Safety Foundation]] |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aircraft and occupants==
The aircraft involved in the accident, registered CH-170, was a [[Curtiss T-32 Condor II|Curtiss AT-32C Condor II]], a variant of the standard T-32 developed specifically for Swiss [[flag carrier]] [[Swissair]], which was its only operator.  CH-170 had entered service on 28 March 1934 and, by the time of the accident, had only been in service for four months.  The cabin was configured with seating for up to 15 people.&lt;ref name="TDIA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdayinaviation.com/27-july-1934/ |title=This Day in Aviation - 27 July 1934 |author=Swopes, Brian |date= |website=thisdayinaviation.com |publisher= |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft's [[flight attendant]], [[Nelly Diener]], also known as the ''Engel der Lüfte'' ("Angel of the Skies"), is notable for being Europe's first air stewardess.  She had been working for Swissair since 1 May 1934.  The other two crew members were the pilot, Armin Mühlematter, and the radio navigator, Hans Daschinger.  On the accident flight, there were nine passengers aboard.&lt;ref name="TDIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BAAA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baaa-acro.com/1934/archives/crash-of-a-curtiss-condor-32-in-tuttlingen-12-killed/ |title=Crash of a Curtiss Condor 32 in Tuttlingen: 12 killed |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=baaa-acro.com |publisher=Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives |accessdate=17 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222235031/http://www.baaa-acro.com/1934/archives/crash-of-a-curtiss-condor-32-in-tuttlingen-12-killed/ |archive-date=2014-02-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==

The aircraft departed [[Zurich]] for [[Berlin]], with stopovers in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Leipzig]].  Shortly after crossing the Swiss-German border, the aircraft, cruising at an altitude of about 3,000 meters, encountered a thunderstorm, and while flying through it, the right wing eventually broke off.  This resulted in an immediate loss of control and the aircraft plummeted into a forest near [[Tuttlingen]], exploding into flames on impact.&lt;ref name="TDIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASN0727"&gt;{{ASN accident|title=Swissair Curtiss AT-32C Condor II ''CH-170''|id=19340727-0 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1934/1934-16.htm |title=Accident Details |last1=Kebabjian |first1=Richard |date= |website=planecrashinfo.com |publisher=Plane Crash Info |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

Investigators found that oscillations in the wing had caused a stress fracture, the severity of which was exacerbated by the violent weather conditions in which the aircraft was flying.  German investigators, however, determined that one fracture formed in the wing and engine mount structure due to defective construction and welding techniques in conjunction with the engine vibrations, while a second fracture resulted from the force of the turbulence in the storm.&lt;ref name="TDIA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BAAA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6305">'''Argon flash''', also known as '''argon bomb''', '''argon flash bomb''', '''argon candle''', and '''argon light source''', is a single-use source of very short and extremely bright flashes of light. The light is generated by a [[shock wave]] in [[argon]] or, less commonly, other [[noble gas]]. The shock wave is usually produced by an [[explosion]]. Argon flash devices are almost exclusively used for photographing explosions and shock waves.

Although [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] can be also used; argon is favorable because of its low cost.&lt;ref name="intdet"/&gt;

The light generated by an [[explosion]] is produced primarily by compression heating of the surrounding air. Replacement of the air with a noble gas considerably increases the light output; with [[molecular]] gases, the energy is consumed partially by [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and other processes, while noble gases are monatomic and can only undergo [[ionization]]; the [[ionized gas]] then produces the light. The low [[specific heat capacity]] of noble gases allows heating to higher temperatures, yielding brighter emission.&lt;ref name="intdet"/&gt; [[Flashtube]]s are filled with noble gases for the same reason.

Typical argon flash devices consist of an argon-filled cardboard or plastic tube with a transparent window on one end and an explosive charge on the other end. Many explosives can be used; [[Composition B]], [[PETN]], [[RDX]], and [[plastic bonded explosive]]s are just a few examples.

The device consists of a vessel filled with argon and a solid [[explosive]] charge. The explosion generates a shock wave, which heats the gas to very high temperature (over 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K; published values vary between 15,000&amp;nbsp;K to 30,000&amp;nbsp;K with the best values around 25,000&amp;nbsp;K&lt;ref name="intdet"&gt;[http://www.intdetsymp.org/detsymp2006/downloadmanuscript.asp?MyID=110 Explosive-driven shock waves in argon]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, William C. Davis, Terry R. Salyer, Scott I. Jackson, and Tariq D. Aslam, Los Alamos National Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;). The gas becomes [[incandescent]] and emits a flash of intense visible and [[ultraviolet]] [[black body radiation]]. The emission for the temperature range is highest between 97–193&amp;nbsp;nm, but usually only the visible and near-ultraviolet ranges are exploited.

To achieve emission, the layer of at least one or two [[optical depth]]s of the gas has to be compressed to sufficient temperature. The light intensity rises to full magnitude in about 0.1 microsecond. For about 0.5 microsecond the shock wave front instabilities are sufficient to create significant striations in the produced light; this effect diminishes as the thickness of the compressed layer increases. Only about 75 micrometers thick layer of the gas is responsible for the light emission. The shock wave reflects after reaching the window at the end of the tube; this yields a short increase of light intensity. The intensity then fades &lt;ref name="intdet"/&gt;

The amount of explosive can control the intensity of the shock wave and therefore of the flash. The intensity of the flash can be increased and its duration decreased by reflecting the shock wave by a suitable obstacle; a foil or a curved glass can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATiYCfo1VcEC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Argon+flash%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Argon%20flash%22 |title=Explosives|page=21|author1=Rudolf Meyer |author2=Josef Köhler |author3=Axel Homburg |publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2007|isbn=3-527-31656-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of the flash is about as long as the explosion itself, depending on the construction of the lamp, between 0.1 and 100 microseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEFPNfghI3QC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=%22Argon+bomb%22+-Wikipedia+-inpublisher:icon&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Argon%20bomb%22|page=445 |title=Scientific photography and applied imaging
|author=Sidney F. Ray|publisher=Focal Press|year=1999|isbn=0-240-51323-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration is dependent on the length of the shockwave path through the gas, which is propoportional to the length of the tube; it was shown that each centimeter of the path of shock wave through the argon medium is equivalent to 2 microseconds.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMSm9_iXg5kC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=%22Argon+bomb%22&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Argon%20bomb%22 |page=263|title=High-pressure shock compression of solids VIII: the science and technology of high-velocity impact|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=3-540-22866-7|author1=Lalit C. Chhabildas |author2=Lee Davison |author3=Yasuyuki Horie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argon flash is a standard procedure for [[high speed photography]], especially for photographing explosions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yarchive.net/explosives/argon_flash.html |title=Argon flash (Arno Hahma) |publisher=Yarchive.net |date=1999-01-29 |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or less commonly for use in high altitude test vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=4310914 |title=Energy Citations Database (ECD) - Document #4310914 |publisher=Osti.gov |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photography of explosions and shock waves is made easy by the fact that the detonation of the argon flash lamp charge can be accurately timed relative to the test specimen explosion and the light intensity can overpower the light generated by the explosion itself. The formation of shock waves during explosions of [[shaped charge]]s can be imaged this way.

As the amount of released radiant energy is fairly high, significant heating of the illuminated object can occur. Especially in case of high explosives this has to be taken into account.

Super Radiant Light (SRL) sources are an alternative to argon flash. An electron beam source delivers brief and intense pulse of electrons to suitable crystals (e.g. [[cadmium sulfide]]). Flash times in nanosecond to picosecond range are achievable. Pulsed [[laser]]s are another alternative.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4862">'''[[Publicly Available Specification|PAS]] 2060''' is a specification detailing how to demonstrate [[carbon neutrality]] produced and published by the [[British Standards Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/PAS2060|title=PAS 2060 Carbon Neutrality - BSI Group|website=www.bsigroup.com|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The [[British Standards Institution]] announced the development of the PAS 2060 Standard for Carbon Neutrality in October 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/About-BSI/News-Room/BSI-News-Content/Disciplines/Sustainability/PAS-2060-release/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118031629/http://www.bsigroup.com/en/About-BSI/News-Room/BSI-News-Content/Disciplines/Sustainability/PAS-2060-release/ |archive-date=2010-11-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the objective of increasing transparency of carbon neutrality claims by providing a common definition and recognized method of achieving carbon neutral status.

The steering group was made up of a number of public and private organisations and associations, including the Association of British Certification Bodies, [[Aviva]], BREEAM (BRE Environmental Assessment Method), [[Carbon Clear]], [[The Carbon Neutral Company]], [[EcoAct]], [[The Carbon Trust]], [[The Co-operative Group]], [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]], [[Eurostar]], Future Conversations (Concrete Centre), [[Good Energy]], [[Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment]], [[Marks and Spencer]], [[Oxford Brookes University]] and UPM-Kymmene.

PAS 2060 Specification for the demonstration of carbon neutrality was launched in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/About-BSI/News-Room/BSI-News-Content/Disciplines/Sustainability/Demonstrate-your-carbon-neutrality-status-with-confidence/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721181344/http://www.bsigroup.com/en/About-BSI/News-Room/BSI-News-Content/Disciplines/Sustainability/Demonstrate-your-carbon-neutrality-status-with-confidence/ |archive-date=2011-07-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compliance with PAS 2060 ==

The specification defines a consistent set of measures and requirements for entities (e.g. organisations, governments, communities, families, individuals) to demonstrate carbon neutrality for a product, service, organisation, community, event or building.&lt;ref name="bsispec"&gt;BSi. ''PAS 2060:2010 Specification for the demonstration of carbon neutrality''. {{ISBN|978-0-580-66752-7}}, April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[carbon footprint]] measurements should include 100% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, plus all Scope 3 emissions that contribute more than 1% of the total footprint.  

The entity must develop a Carbon Management Plan which contains a public commitment to [[carbon neutrality]] and outlines the following major aspects of the reduction strategy: a time scale, specific targets for reductions, the planned means of achieving reductions and how residual emissions will be offset.

PAS 2060 requires that the total amount of [[carbon emissions]] at the end of a reduction period be [[carbon offset|offset]] by high-quality, certified carbon credits which meet the following criteria: 

•	From one of the PAS 2060 approved schemes (for example the [[Clean Development Mechanism]], [[Joint Implementation]] or [[Verified Carbon Standard]])

•	Genuinely additional (i.e. reductions that would not have happened anyway)

•	Verified by an independent third party to ensure that emission reductions are permanent, avoid leakage (so that emissions are not increased in another area as a result of the project reductions) and are not double counted

•	Retired after a maximum of 12 months to a credible registry.

== Documentation and verification ==

PAS 2060 requires a standard-compliant declaration of achievement of neutrality through a set of Qualifying Explanatory Statements and public disclosure of all the documentation that supports the carbon neutrality claim.&lt;ref name="bsispec"/&gt;

The standard stipulates three types of validation of the achievement of neutrality: self validation, other party validation and third party independent validation. Other party validation occurs when the methodology and data has been audited and verified by an external organisation; third party independent validation occurs when it is verification is by an agent registered with [[UKAS]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">A '''battery eliminator''' is a device powered by an electrical source other than a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], which then converts the source to a suitable [[direct current|DC]] [[voltage]] that may be used by a second device designed to be powered by batteries. A battery eliminator eliminates the need to replace batteries but may remove the advantage of portability. A battery eliminator is also effective in replacing obsolete battery designs.

Some examples of battery eliminators include the nine volt mains [[power supply]], the size and shape of a [[PP9 battery]], originally intended to replace the battery in portable radios in the 1960s.  A [[solar panel]] providing power for a portable appliance may also be considered a battery eliminator.  The term is also sometimes used as a misnomer when using a bigger battery for more runtime when branching out a power supply to wired electrical equipment using DC input.

==History==
Early commercial battery eliminators were produced by the [[Edward S. Rogers, Sr.]] company in 1925 as a complement to his line of "batteryless" [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]]s. Another early producer of battery eliminators was the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation (later known as [[Motorola]]) which was opened on September 25, 1928 by [[Paul Galvin (businessman)|Paul Galvin]] and his brother Joseph E. Galvin, to build battery eliminators for radio receivers installed in automobiles.

The first [[Car audio|car radio]] receivers were based on [[vacuum tube]] technology which required two or three different voltages to function:
* LT (Low Tension (UK usage), low voltage (US usage)) typically 4 or 6.3 volts at high current to power the filaments
* HT (High Tension (UK usage), high voltage (US usage) typically 100 to 300 volts at low current to power the [[anode]] circuitry
* Additional voltages were sometimes also required for [[grid bias]].

Batteries designed for these portable vacuum tube receivers were a combination of several different battery types and sizes, combined in a single package and intended to slowly wear out at about the same rate. The battery typically connected to the radio via a specially shaped four- or five-pin connector, keyed so that the plug must be inserted correctly.  A battery eliminator would take the typical 6-volt or 12-volt DC power from a car battery and transform it into the required LT and HT needed to power the vacuum tubes in a car radio.  Without a battery eliminator, it was necessary to occasionally replace the [[battery pack]] in the vacuum-tube car radio.

== Studio photography ==
[[Tripod]]-mounted cameras in [[Photographic studio|photography studio]]s often use a battery eliminator to avoid having to interrupt lengthy shooting sessions to replace batteries. The use of the tripod can also interfere with access to the battery hatch.

==See also==
*[[Batteryless radio]]
*[[Batteryless switch]]
*[[Battery eliminator circuit]] (BEC), a circuit typically used for [[radio-controlled model]]s, where a low-power radio receiver obtains its supply from the main [[traction battery]], without needing a separate receiver battery.

[[Bottle]]s are able to be [[recycling|recycled]] and this is generally a positive option. Bottles are collected via [[kerbside collection]] or returned using a [[Container deposit legislation|bottle deposit]] system. [http://bottlerecycle.org/ Bottlerecycle.org/] reveals that just 14% of all [[plastic packaging]] is [[Recycling|recycled]] globally&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bottlerecycle.org/|title=BottleRecycle.org – FOR CLEANER WORLD|website=bottlerecycle.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PET bottle recycling|PET bottles]] production is predicted to grow by about 5% a year. Currently just over half of [[Plastic bottle|plastic bottles]] are recycled globally&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bottlerecycle.org/|title=BottleRecycle.org – FOR CLEANER WORLD|website=bottlerecycle.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1 million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and only about 50% are recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bottlerecycle.org/|title=BottleRecycle.org – FOR CLEANER WORLD|website=bottlerecycle.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glass bottles==
[[Glass bottle]]s are fully recyclable, either to be reused as bottle or to be melted and reused as glass, resulting in a saving of energy and raw materials.

Recycling one glass bottle can save enough energy to power a [[computer]] for 25 minutes. {{Citation needed|reason=Claimed fact with no source|date=October 2018}}

==PET bottles==
{{Main|PET bottle recycling}}
PET bottles are mostly recycled as a raw material. In many countries, PET plastics are coded with the resin identification code number "1" inside the universal recycling symbol, usually located on the bottom of the container.

==HDPE bottles==
HDPE is commonly used in bottles, particularly bottles (or jugs) of milk.  Recycling code 2 is applicable.  In the US, only about 30-35% of HDPE bottles are recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url= https://plastics.americanchemistry.com/2016-US-National-Postconsumer-Plastic-Bottle-Recycling-Report.pdf
 |title= 2016 United States National Postconsumer Plastic Bottle Recycling Report
 |publisher=Association of Plastic Rcyclers 
 |year =2017
 |access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
[[Container deposit legislation]] are laws passed by city, state, provincial, or national governments.  They require a deposit on bottles to be collected when sold and reimbursed when returned.

In May 2018 the Israeli Ministry Impose EUR 12 m Fine on Bottle Manufacturers and Importers that Didn't Meet Collection Targets

==Environmental comparisons==

Many potential  factors are involved in environmental comparisons of returnable vs non-returnable systems.  Researchers have often used [[life cycle analysis]] methodologies to balance the many diverse considerations.  Often the comparisons show benefits and problems with all alternatives.   It helps provide a objective view of a complex subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Van Doorsselaer |first=K | author2 = Fox |year= 2000|title=Estimation of the energy needs in life cycle analysis of one-way and returnable glass packaging

Reuse of bottles requires a [[reverse logistics]] system, cleaning and, sanitizing bottles, and an effective [[Quality Management System]].  A key factor with glass milk bottles is the number of cycles of uses to be expected.  Breakage, contamination,  or other loss reduces the benefits of returnables.  A key factor with one-way recyclables is the recycling rate:  In the US, only about 30-35% of HDPE bottles are recycled.

'''Carbon dioxide reformation''' (also known as '''dry reformation''') is a method of producing [[synthesis gas]] (mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) from the reaction of [[carbon dioxide]] with hydrocarbons such as [[methane]]. Synthesis gas is conventionally produced via the [[steam reforming]] reaction. In recent years, increased concerns on the contribution of greenhouse gases to [[global warming]] have increased interest in the replacement of steam as reactant with carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R5NuqNaCkkkC&amp;pg=PA34 | chapter = Carbon Dioxide Reforming | title = Chemical fixation of carbon dioxide: methods for recycling CO2 into useful products | first = Martin M. | last = Halmann| publisher =CRC Press |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-8493-4428-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dry reforming reaction may be represented by:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 CO
Thus, two [[greenhouse gas]]es are consumed and useful chemical building blocks, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, are produced.  A challenge to the commercialization of this process is that the hydrogen that is produced tends to react with the carbon dioxide.  For example, the following reaction typically proceeds with a lower activation energy than the dry reforming reaction itself:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  CO
Typical catalysts are noble metals, Ni or Ni alloys. In addition, a group of researchers in China investigated the use of activated carbon as an alternative catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Catalytic Carbon Dioxide Reforming of Methane to Synthesis Gas over Activated Carbon Catalyst|url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ie800117a|journal = Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|pages = 4349–4357|volume = 47|issue = 13|doi = 10.1021/ie800117a|first = Qilei|last = Song|first2 = Rui|last2 = Xiao|first3 = Yanbing|last3 = Li|first4 = Laihong|last4 = Shen|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = CO2 reforming of CH4 over Efficient bimetallic Co-Zr/AC catalyst for H2 production |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319915017395 |journal = I International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |pages = 1268–12879|volume = 40|issue = 37|doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.07.011 |first = Guojie|last = Zhang|first2 = Lanxia|last2 = Hao|first3 = Yong|last3 = Jia|first4 = Yannian|last4 = Du|year = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of preparation methods on the properties of cobalt/carbon catalyst for methane reforming with carbon dioxide to syngas |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1226086X13003791|journal = Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry |pages = 1677–1683|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.jiec.2013.08.016 |first = Guojie|last = Zhang|first2 = Yiannian|last2 = Duo|first3 = Ying|last3 = Xu|first4 =Yongfa|last4 = Zhang|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Towards understanding the carbon catalyzed CO2 reforming of methane to syngas |journal = Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1226086X14001257 |pages = 311–317|volume = 21|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jiec.2014.02.038 |first = Guojie|last = Zhang|first2 = Jiangwen|last2 = Qu|first3 = Aiting|last3 =Su|first4 = Yongfa|last4 = Zhang|first5 = Ying|last5 = Xu |year = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Catalytic performance of activated carbon supported cobalt catalyst for CO2 reforming of CH4|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979714004573|journal = Journal of Colloid and Interface Science |pages = 149–155|volume = 433 |doi = 10.1016/j.jcis.2014.06.038|first =Guojie|last = Zhang|first2 = Aiting|last2 = Su|first3 = Yannian|last3 = Dui|first4 = Jiangwen|last4 = Qu|first5 = Ying|last5 = Xu |year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = CO2 Reforming of CH4 in Coke Oven Gas over Coal Char Catalys|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138589470900254X|journal = Chemical Engineering Journal |pages = 519–523 |volume= 156 |issue=3 |doi= 10.1016/j.cej.2009.04.005 |first=Guojie |last= Zhang |first2=Yue |last2= Dong |first3= Meirong |last3= Feng |first4= Yongfa |last4= Zhang |first5= Wei |last5= Zhao |first6= Hongcheng |last6= Cao |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Challicum Hills Wind Farm''' is a [[wind farm]] encompassed by 35 (1.5 MW) [[NEG Micon|NEG]] NM 64 [[wind turbines]],  with a total generating capacity of 52.5 [[Megawatt|MW]] of [[electricity]]. The wind farm is near [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] in western  [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. The power station was commissioned in August 2003 and is in a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Origin Energy.

The wind farm is owned and operated by [[Pacific Hydro]]. Part of the profits flow into a community fund that supports local projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.araratadvertiser.com.au/story/1870067/ten-years-of-wind-farm-operation/ "Ten years of wind farm operation"] in ''The Ararat Advertiser'', 29 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cierzo''' is a strong, dry and usually cold wind that blows from the North or Northwest through the regions of [[Aragon]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]] and [[Navarra]] in the [[Ebro valley]] in Spain. It takes place when there is an [[anticyclone]] in the [[Bay of Biscay]] and an [[low-pressure area]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

It is known since ancient times, and its name stems from the Latin word ''circius'', which probably came from an [[Iberian language|Iberian]] word. [[Cato the Elder]] described it in the 2nd century BC as "a wind that fills your mouth and tumbles waggons and armed men."&lt;ref name="library"&gt;R. Riosalido, L. Vazquez, A. Gordo and A.

'''Climate Change Capital''' is a private [[asset management]] and advisory group founded in 2003 by Lionel Fretz and James Cameron to support efforts to develop solutions to climate change and resource depletion.

==History==
The company established an advisory group in 2004 to provide financial, strategic and policy advice to energy-intensive industries, financial institutions, [[cleantech]] companies and governments.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

The asset management business, which was established in 2005, includes a carbon finance fund that invests in emission reduction projects, predominantly in developing countries, a private equity fund that invests in late stage technology and services companies headquartered in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-168650862.html|title=Investors prove their green credentials as Climate Change Capital raises AGBP135m.|publisher=Investment Adviser|date=September 10, 2007|subscription=yes|via=Highbeam|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a property fund that buys [[Green buildings|commercial green buildings]] or retrofits existing commercial properties in the United Kingdom.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

The company's think tank was established in 2009 to promote discussion of how capital can be deployed to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

In 2006, the group launched the world's largest private sector carbon fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=UK carbon fund launched.(Climate Change Capital)|publisher=Chemistry and Industry|date=September 18, 2006|subscription=yes|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dust collector kosovo.jpg|thumb|Two rooftop dust collectors in [[Pristina]], [[Kosovo]]]]
A '''dust collector''' is a system used to enhance the quality of air released from industrial and commercial processes by collecting [[dust]] and other impurities from air or gas. Designed to handle high-volume dust loads, a dust collector system consists of a blower, dust filter, a filter-cleaning system, and a dust receptacle or dust removal system. It is distinguished from [[air purifier]]s, which use disposable filters to remove dust.

==History==
[[File:HL Beth – WFL Beth.jpg|thumb|upright|Wilhelm Beth]]
[[File:HL Beth – BF KS2.jpg|thumb|upright|''"Beth"-Filter "KS"'' (1910)]]

{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
The father of the dust collector was [[Wilhelm Beth]] from [[Lübeck]].&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Wilh. Straus: "Erste und älteste Spezialfabrik für Industrie - Entstaubung, Staubsammlung und Raumlufttechnik", in: Lübeck seit Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts; Herausgeber: Lübeckische Anzeigen und Lübecker Zeitung, Lübeck 1926, S. 340-346, S. 341 vgl. desweiteren zur Firmengeschichte Fahl 1935, S.116-117; Lübeckische Blätter 1890, S. 404, Meldung 245, Local und vermischte Notizen: W. F. L. Beth wurde ein Patent erteilt Nr. 53553 vom 20. Oktober 1889 für Lüftungseinrichtungen in Eisenbahnwaggons&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, he patented three filter designs that he had pioneered to remove dust from air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Shaking device for cleaning filters|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1389481|accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Air or gas filter|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1389482|accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Air-filter|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US1390966|accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Dust collectors are used in many processes to either recover valuable granular solid or powder from process streams, or to remove granular solid pollutants from exhaust gases prior to venting to the atmosphere. Dust collection is an online process for collecting any process-generated dust from the source point on a continuous basis. Dust collectors may be of single unit construction, or a collection of devices used to separate particulate matter from the process air. They are often used as an [[air pollution control]] device to maintain or improve air quality.

Mist collectors remove particulate matter in the form of fine liquid droplets from the air. They are often used for the collection of metal working fluids, and coolant or oil mists. Mist collectors are often used to improve or maintain the quality of air in the workplace environment.

Fume and smoke collectors are used to remove sub-micrometer-size particulates from the air. They effectively reduce or eliminate particulate matter and gas streams from many industrial processes such as [[welding]], rubber and plastic processing, high speed machining with coolants, [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]], and [[quenching]].

==Types of dust collectors==
Five main types of industrial dust collectors are:
*Inertial separators
*Fabric filters
*Wet scrubbers
*Unit collectors
*Electrostatic precipitators

==Inertial separators==
Inertial separators separate dust from gas streams using a combination of forces, such as centrifugal, gravitational, and inertial. These forces move the dust to an area where the forces exerted by the gas stream are minimal. The separated dust is moved by gravity into a hopper, where it is temporarily stored.

The three primary types of inertial separators are:
*Settling chambers
*Baffle chambers
*Centrifugal collectors

Neither settling chambers nor baffle chambers are commonly used in the minerals processing industry. However, their principles of operation are often incorporated into the design of more efficient dust collectors.

===Settling chamber===
[[File:Settling chamber.jpg|right]]
A settling chamber consists of a large box installed in the ductwork. The increase of cross section area at the chamber reduces the speed of the dust-filled airstream and heavier particles settle out.
Settling chambers are simple in design and can be manufactured from almost any material. However, they are seldom used as primary dust collectors because of their large space requirements and low efficiency. A practical use is as precleaners for more efficient collect.
Advantages: 1) simple construction and low cost 2) maintenance free 3) collects particles without need of water. Disadvantages: 1) low efficiency 2) large space required.

===Baffle chamber===
[[File:Baffle chambers2.svg|thumb|Diagram of a Baffle Chamber]]
Baffle chambers use a fixed baffle plate that causes the conveying gas stream to make a sudden change of direction. Large-diameter particles do not follow the gas stream but continue into a dead air space and settle. Baffle chambers are used as precleaners

===Centrifugal collectors===
[[File:SCyclone.jpg|right]]
{{Main|Cyclonic separation}}
Centrifugal collectors use cyclonic action to separate dust particles from the gas stream. In a typical cyclone, the dust gas stream enters at an angle and is spun rapidly. The centrifugal force created by the circular flow throws the dust particles toward the wall of the cyclone. After striking the wall, these particles fall into a hopper located underneath.

The most common types of centrifugal, or inertial, collectors in use today are:

====Single-cyclone separators====
Single-cyclone separators create a dual vortex to separate coarse from fine dust. The main vortex spirals downward and carries most of the coarser dust particles. The inner vortex, created near the bottom of the cyclone, spirals upward and carries finer dust particles.

====Multiple-cyclone separators====
[[File:Multiclone.jpg|right]]
Multiple-cyclone separators consist of a number of small-diameter cyclones, operating in parallel and having a common gas inlet and outlet, as shown in the figure, and operate on the same principle as single cyclone separators—creating an outer downward vortex and an ascending inner vortex.

Multiple-cyclone separators remove more dust than single cyclone separators because the individual cyclones have a greater length and smaller diameter. The longer length provides longer residence time while the smaller diameter creates greater centrifugal force. These two factors result in better separation of dust particulates. The pressure drop of multiple-cyclone separators collectors is higher than that of single-cyclone separators, requiring more energy to clean the same amount of air. A single-chamber cyclone separator of the same volume is more economical, but doesn't remove as much dust.

Cyclone separators are found in all types of power and industrial applications, including pulp and paper plants, cement plants, steel mills, petroleum coke plants, metallurgical plants, saw mills and other kinds of facilities that process dust.

====Secondary-air-flow separators====
This type of cyclone uses a secondary air flow, injected into the cyclone to accomplish several things. The secondary air flow increases the speed of the cyclonic action making the separator more efficient; it intercepts the particulate before it reaches the interior walls of the unit; and it forces the separated particulate toward the collection area. The secondary air flow protects the separator from particulate abrasion and allows the separator to be installed horizontally because gravity is not depended upon to move the separated particulate downward.

==Fabric filters==
[[File:Baghouse.jpg|right]]
Commonly known as [[baghouse]]s, fabric collectors use filtration to separate dust particulates from dusty gases. They are one of the most efficient and cost-effective types of dust collectors available, and can achieve a collection efficiency of more than 99% for very fine particulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neundorfer.com/knowledge_base/baghouse_fabric_filters.aspx |title=Baghouse / Fabric Filters KnowledgeBase |publisher=Neundorfer.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dust-laden gases enter the baghouse and pass through fabric bags that act as filters. The bags can be of woven or felted cotton, synthetic, or glass-fiber material in either a tube or envelope shape.

===Pre-coating===
To ensure the filter bags have a long usage life they are commonly coated with a filter enhancer (pre-coat). The use of chemically inert limestone (calcium carbonate) is most common as it maximises efficiency of dust collection (including fly ash) via formation of what is called a dustcake or coating on the surface of the filter media. This not only traps fine particulates but also provides protection for the bag itself from moisture, and oily or sticky particulates which can bind the filter media. Without a pre-coat the filter bag allows fine particulates to bleed through the bag filter system, especially during start-up, as the bag can only do part of the filtration leaving the finer parts to the filter enhancer dustcake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fabricsforindustry.com/precoat.asp |title=Precoat Instructions |publisher=Fabrics for Industry |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iac-intl.com/parts-category.php?PageURL=pre-coat-powder |title=Pre-Coat Powder |publisher=Iac-intl.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130426165525/http://www.iac-intl.com/parts-category.php?PageURL=pre-coat-powder |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parts===
Fabric filters generally have the following parts:
# Clean plenum
# Dusty plenum
# Bag, cage, venturi assembly
# Tubeplate
# RAV/SCREW
# Compressed air header
# Blow pipe
# Housing and hopper

===Types of bag cleaning===
[[Baghouse]]s are characterized by their cleaning method.&lt;ref&gt;[https://maidsailors.com/pdfs/Fabric-Filter-Bag-Cleaning-Maid-Sailors.pdf Fabric Filter Bag Cleaner]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shaking====
A rod connecting to the bag is powered by a motor. This provides motion to remove caked-on particles. The speed and motion of the shaking depends on the design of the bag and composition of the particulate matter. Generally shaking is horizontal. The top of the bag is closed and the bottom is open. When shaken, the dust collected on the inside of the bag is freed. During the cleaning process, no dirty gas flows through a bag while the bag is being cleaned. This redirection of air flow illustrates why baghouses must be compartmentalized.

====Reverse air====
Air flow gives the bag structure. Dirty air flows through the bag from the inside, allowing dust to collect on the interior surface. During cleaning, gas flow is restricted from a specific compartment. Without the flowing air, the bags relax. The cylindrical bag contains rings that prevent it from completely collapsing under the pressure of the air. A fan blows clean air in the reverse direction. The relaxation and reverse air flow cause the dust cake to crumble and release into the hopper. Upon the completion of the cleaning process, dirty air flow continues and the bag regains its shape.

====Pulse jet====
This type of baghouse cleaning (also known as pressure-jet cleaning) is the most common. A high pressure blast of air is used to remove dust from the bag. The blast enters the top of the bag tube, temporarily ceasing the flow of dirty air. The shock of air causes a wave of expansion to travel down the fabric. The flexing of the bag shatters and discharges the dust cake.
The air burst is about 0.1 second and it takes about 0.5 seconds for the shock wave to travel down the length of the bag. Due to its rapid release, the blast of air does not interfere with contaminated gas flow. Therefore, pulse-jet baghouses can operate continuously and are not usually compartmentalized.
The blast of compressed air must be powerful enough to ensure that the shock wave will travel the entire length of the bag and fracture the dust cake.
The efficiency of the cleaning system allows the unit to have a much higher gas to cloth ratio (or volumetric throughput of gas per unit area of filter) than shaking and reverse air bag filters&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Filters.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This kind of filter thus requires a smaller area to admit the same volume of air.

====Sonic====
The least common type of cleaning method is sonic. Shaking is achieved by sonic vibration. A sound generator produces a low frequency sound that causes the bags to vibrate. Sonic cleaning is commonly combined with another method of cleaning to ensure thorough cleaning.

====Cartridge collectors====
Cartridge collectors use perforated metal cartridges that contain a pleated, nonwoven filtering media, as opposed to woven or felt bags used in baghouses. The pleated design allows for a greater total filtering surface area than in a conventional bag of the same diameter, The greater filtering area results in a reduced air to media ratio, pressure drop, and overall collector size.

Cartridge collectors are available in single use or continuous duty designs. In single-use collectors, the dirty cartridges are changed and collected dirt is removed while the collector is off. In the continuous duty design, the cartridges are cleaned by the conventional pulse-jet cleaning system.

==Wet scrubbers==
{{See also|Particle collection in wet scrubbers}}
[[File:Wet scrubber.jpg|right]]
Dust collectors that use liquid are known as [[wet scrubber]]s. In these systems, the scrubbing liquid (usually water) comes into contact with a gas stream containing dust particles. Greater contact of the gas and liquid streams yields higher dust removal efficiency.

There is a large variety of wet scrubbers; however, all have one of three basic configurations:

1. Gas-humidification - The gas-humidification process agglomerates fine particles, increasing the bulk, making collection easier.

2. Gas-liquid contact - This is one of the most important factors affecting collection efficiency. The particle and droplet come into contact by four primary mechanisms:
:a) Inertial impaction - When water droplets placed in the path of a dust-laden gas stream, the stream separates and flows around them. Due to inertia, the larger dust particles will continue on in a straight path, hit the droplets, and become encapsulated.
:b) Interception - Finer particles moving within a gas stream do not hit droplets directly but brush against and adhere to them.
:c) Diffusion - When liquid droplets are scattered among dust particles, the particles are deposited on the droplet surfaces by Brownian movement, or diffusion. This is the principal mechanism in the collection of submicrometre dust particles.
:d) Condensation nucleation - If a gas passing through a scrubber is cooled below the dewpoint, condensation of moisture occurs on the dust particles. This increase in particle size makes collection easier.

3. Gas-liquid separation - Regardless of the contact mechanism used, as much liquid and dust as possible must be removed. Once contact is made, dust particulates and water droplets combine to form agglomerates. As the agglomerates grow larger, they settle into a collector.

The "cleaned" gases are normally passed through a mist eliminator (demister pads) to remove water droplets from the gas stream. The dirty water from the scrubber system is either cleaned and discharged or recycled to the scrubber. Dust is removed from the scrubber in a clarification unit or a [[drag chain]] tank. In both systems solid material settles on the bottom of the tank. A [[drag chain]] system removes the sludge and deposits in into a dumpster or stockpile.

===Types of scrubbers===
Spray-tower scrubber wet scrubbers may be categorized by pressure drop as follows:

*Low-energy scrubbers (0.5 to 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches water gauge - 124.4 to 621.9 Pa)
*Low- to medium-energy scrubbers (2.5 to 6&amp;nbsp;inches water gauge - 0.622 to 1.493 kPa)
*Medium- to high-energy scrubbers (6 to 15&amp;nbsp;inches water gauge - 1.493 to 3.731 kPa)
*High-energy scrubbers (greater than 15&amp;nbsp;inches water gauge - greater than 3.731 kPa)

Due to the large number of commercial scrubbers available, it is not possible to describe each individual type here. However, the following sections provide examples of typical scrubbers in each category.

====Low-energy scrubbers====
In the simple, gravity-spray-tower scrubber, liquid droplets formed by liquid atomized in spray nozzles fall through rising exhaust gases. Dirty water is drained at the bottom.

These scrubbers operated at pressure drops of 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;in. water gauge (¼ to ½ kPa) and are approximately 70% efficient on 10&amp;nbsp;µm particles. Their efficiency is poor below 10&amp;nbsp;µm. However, they are capable of treating relatively high dust concentrations without becoming plugged.

====Low- to medium-energy scrubbers====
Wet cyclones use centrifugal force to spin the dust particles (similar to a cyclone), and throw the particulates upon the collector's wetted walls. Water introduced from the top to wet the cyclone walls carries these particles away. The wetted walls also prevent dust reentrainment.

Pressure drops for these collectors range from 2 to 8&amp;nbsp;in. water (½ to 2 kPa), and the collection efficiency is good for 5 μm particles and above.

====High-energy scrubbers co-current-flow scrubber====
Packed-bed scrubbers consist of beds of packing elements, such as coke, broken rock, rings, saddles, or other manufactured elements. The packing breaks down the liquid flow into a high-surface-area film so that the dusty gas streams passing through the bed achieve maximum contact with the liquid film and become deposited on the surfaces of the packing elements. These scrubbers have a good collection efficiency for respirable dust.

Three types of packed-bed scrubbers are:
*Cross-flow scrubbers
*Co-current flow scrubbers
*Counter-current flow scrubbers

Efficiency can be greatly increased by minimizing target size, i.e., using 0.003&amp;nbsp;in. (0.076&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter stainless steel wire and increasing gas velocity to more than 1,800&amp;nbsp;ft/min (9.14&amp;nbsp;m/s).

====High-energy scrubbers====
Venturi scrubbers consist of a venturi-shaped inlet and separator. The dust-laden gases venturi scrubber enter through the venturi and are accelerated to speeds between 12,000 and 36,000&amp;nbsp;ft/min (60.97-182.83&amp;nbsp;m/s). These high-gas velocities immediately atomize the coarse water spray, which is injected radially into the venturi throat, into fine droplets. High energy and extreme turbulence promote collision between water droplets and dust particulates in the throat. The agglomeration process between particle and droplet continues in the diverging section of the venturi. The large agglomerates formed in the venturi are then removed by an inertial separator.

Venturi scrubbers achieve very high collection efficiencies for respirable dust. Since efficiency of a venturi scrubber depends on pressure drop, some manufacturers supply a variable-throat venturi to maintain pressure drop with varying gas flows.

==Electrostatic precipitators (ESP)==
{{Main|Electrostatic precipitator}}
Electrostatic precipitators use electrostatic forces to separate dust particles from exhaust gases. A number of high-voltage, direct-current discharge electrodes are placed between grounded collecting electrodes. The contaminated gases flow through the passage formed by the discharge and collecting electrodes. Electrostatic precipitators operate on the same principle as home "Ionic" air purifiers.

The airborne particles receive a negative charge as they pass through the ionized field between the electrodes. These charged particles are then attracted to a grounded or positively charged electrode and adhere to it.

The collected material on the electrodes is removed by rapping or vibrating the collecting electrodes either continuously or at a predetermined interval. Cleaning a precipitator can usually be done without interrupting the airflow.

The four main components of all electrostatic precipitators are:
*Power supply unit, to provide high-voltage DC power
*Ionizing section, to impart a charge to particulates in the gas stream
*A means of removing the collected particulates
*A housing to enclose the precipitator zone

The following factors affect the efficiency of electrostatic precipitators:
*Larger collection-surface areas and lower gas-flow rates increase efficiency because of the increased time available for electrical activity to treat the dust particles.
*An increase in the dust-particle migration velocity to the collecting electrodes increases efficiency. The migration velocity can be increased by:
**Decreasing the gas viscosity
**Increasing the gas temperature
**Increasing the voltage field

===Types of precipitators===
There are two main types of precipitators:
*High-voltage, single-stage - Single-stage precipitators combine an ionization and a collection step. They are commonly referred to as Cottrell precipitators.
*Low-voltage, two-stage - Two-stage precipitators use a similar principle; however, the ionizing section is followed by collection plates.

Described below is the high-voltage, single-stage precipitator, which is widely used in minerals processing operations. The low-voltage, two-stage precipitator is generally used for filtration in air-conditioning systems.

====Plate precipitators====
The majority of electrostatic precipitators installed are the plate type. Particles are collected on flat, parallel surfaces that are 8 to 12&amp;nbsp;in. (20 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm) apart, with a series of discharge electrodes spaced along the centerline of two adjacent plates. The contaminated gases pass through the passage between the plates, and the particles become charged and adhere to the collection plates. Collected particles are usually removed by rapping the plates and deposited in bins or hoppers at the base of the precipitator.

====Tubular precipitators====
Tubular precipitators consist of cylindrical collection electrodes with discharge electrodes located on the axis of the cylinder. The contaminated gases flow around the discharge electrode and up through the inside of the cylinders. The charged particles are collected on the grounded walls of the cylinder. The collected dust is removed from the bottom of the cylinder.

Tubular precipitators are often used for mist or fog collection or for adhesive, sticky, radioactive, or extremely toxic materials.

===Unit collectors===
Unlike central collectors, unit collectors control contamination at its source. They are small and self-contained, consisting of a fan and some form of dust collector. They are suitable for isolated, portable, or frequently moved dust-producing operations, such as bins and silos or remote belt-conveyor transfer points. Advantages of unit collectors include small space requirements, the return of collected dust to main material flow, and low initial cost. However, their dust-holding and storage capacities, servicing facilities, and maintenance periods have been sacrificed.

A number of designs are available, with capacities ranging from 200 to 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft³/min (90 to 900&amp;nbsp;L/s). There are two main types of unit collectors:
*Fabric collectors, with manual shaking or pulse-jet cleaning - normally used for fine dust
*Cyclone collectors - normally used for coarse dust

Fabric collectors are frequently used in minerals processing operations because they provide high collection efficiency and uninterrupted exhaust airflow between cleaning cycles. Cyclone collectors are used when coarser dust is generated, as in woodworking, metal grinding, or machining.

The following points should be considered when selecting a unit collector:
*Cleaning efficiency must comply with all applicable regulations.
*The unit maintains its rated capacity while accumulating large amounts of dust between cleanings.
*Simple cleaning operations do not increase the surrounding dust concentration.
*Has the ability to operate unattended for extended periods of time (for example, 8&amp;nbsp;hours).
*Automatic discharge or sufficient dust storage space to hold at least one week's accumulation.
*If renewable filters are used, they should not have to be replaced more than once a month.
*Durable
*Quiet

Use of unit collectors may not be appropriate if the dust-producing operations are located in an area where central exhaust systems would be practical. Dust removal and servicing requirements are expensive for many unit collectors and are more likely to be neglected than those for a single, large collector.

==Selecting a dust collector==
Dust collectors vary widely in design, operation, effectiveness, space requirements, construction, and capital, operating, and maintenance costs. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. However, the selection of a dust collector should be based on the following general factors:

*Dust concentration and particle size – For minerals processing operations, the dust concentration can range from 0.1 to {{convert|5.0|gr}} of dust per [[cubic foot]] of air (0.23 to 11.44&amp;nbsp;grams per [[cubic meter]]), and the particle size can vary from 0.5 to 100 [[micrometres]]&amp;nbsp;([[micrometre|µm]]) in diameter.
*Degree of dust collection required – The degree of dust collection required depends on its potential as a health hazard or public nuisance, the plant location, the allowable emission rate, the nature of the dust, its salvage value, and so forth. The selection of a collector should be based on the efficiency required and should consider the need for high-efficiency, high-cost equipment, such as electrostatic precipitators; high-efficiency, moderate-cost equipment, such as baghouses or wet scrubbers; or lower cost, primary units, such as dry centrifugal collectors.
*Characteristics of airstream – The characteristics of the airstream can have a significant impact on collector selection. For example, cotton fabric filters cannot be used where air temperatures exceed 180&amp;nbsp;°F (82&amp;nbsp;°C). Also, condensation of steam or water vapor can blind bags. Various chemicals can attack fabric or metal and cause corrosion in wet scrubbers.
*Characteristics of dust – Moderate to heavy concentrations of many dusts (such as dust from silica sand or metal ores) can be abrasive to dry centrifugal collectors. Hygroscopic material can blind bag collectors. Sticky material can adhere to collector elements and plug passages. Some particle sizes and shapes may rule out certain types of fabric collectors. The combustible nature of many fine materials rules out the use of electrostatic precipitators.
*Methods of disposal – Methods of dust removal and disposal vary with the material, plant process, volume, and type of collector used. Collectors can unload continuously or in batches. Dry materials can create secondary dust problems during unloading and disposal that do not occur with wet collectors. Disposal of wet slurry or sludge can be an additional material-handling problem; sewer or water pollution problems can result if wastewater is not treated properly.

==Fan and motor==
The fan and motor system supplies mechanical energy to move contaminated air from the dust-producing source to a dust collector.

===Types of fans===
There are two main kinds of industrial fans:

*Centrifugal fans
*Axial-flow fans

====Centrifugal fans====
[[Centrifugal fan]]s consist of a wheel or a rotor mounted on a shaft that rotates in a scroll-shaped housing. Air enters at the eye of the rotor, makes a right-angle turn, and is forced through the blades of the rotor by centrifugal force into the scroll-shaped housing. The centrifugal force imparts static pressure to the air. The diverging shape of the scroll also converts a portion of the velocity pressure into static pressure.

There are three main types of centrifugal fans:

*Radial-blade fans - Radial-blade fans are used for heavy dust loads. Their straight, radial blades do not get clogged with material, and they withstand considerable abrasion. These fans have medium tip speeds and medium noise factors.
*Backward-blade fans - Backward-blade fans operate at higher tip speeds and thus are more efficient. Since material may build up on the blades, these fans should be used after a dust collector. Although they are noisier than radial-blade fans, backward-blade fans are commonly used for large-volume [[dust collection system]]s because of their higher efficiency.
*Forward-curved-blade fans - These fans have curved blades that are tipped in the direction of rotation. They have low space requirements, low tip speeds, and a low noise factor. They are usually used against low to moderate static pressures.

====Axial-flow fans====
Axial-flow fans are used in systems that have low resistance levels. These fans move the air parallel to the fan's axis of rotation. The screw-like action of the propellers moves the air in a straight-through parallel path, causing a helical flow pattern.

The three main kinds of axial fans are:

*Propeller fans - These fans are used to move large quantities of air against very low static pressures. They are usually used for general ventilation or dilution ventilation and are good in developing up to 0.5&amp;nbsp;in. wg (124.4 Pa).
*Tube-axial fans - Tube-axial fans are similar to propeller fans except they are mounted in a tube or cylinder. Therefore, they are more efficient than propeller fans and can develop up to 3 to 4&amp;nbsp;in. wg (743.3 to 995 Pa). They are best suited for moving air containing substances such as condensible fumes or pigments.
*Vane-axial fans - Vane-axial fans are similar to tube-axial fans except air-straightening vanes are installed on the suction or discharge side of the rotor. They are easily adapted to multistaging and can develop static pressures as high as 14 to 16&amp;nbsp;in. wg (3.483 to 3.98 kPa). They are normally used for clean air only.

Fan selection

When selecting a fan, the following points should be considered:

*Volume required
*Fan static pressure
*Type of material to be handled through the fan (For example, a radial-blade fan should be used with fibrous material or heavy dust loads, and nonsparking construction must be used with explosive or inflammable materials.)
*Type of drive arrangement, such as direct drive or belt drive
*Space requirements
*Noise levels
*[[Operating temperature]] (For example, sleeve bearings are suitable to 250&amp;nbsp;°F/121.1&amp;nbsp;°C; ball bearings to 550&amp;nbsp;°F/287.8&amp;nbsp;°C)
*Sufficient size to handle the required volume and pressure with minimum horsepower
*Need for special coatings or construction when operating in corrosive atmospheres
*Ability of fan to accommodate small changes in total pressure while maintaining the necessary air volume
*Need for an outlet damper to control airflow during cold starts (If necessary, the damper may be interlocked with the fan for a gradual start until steady-state conditions are reached.)

Fan Rating Tables

After the above information is collected, the actual selection of fan size and speed is usually made from a rating table published by the fan manufacturer. This table is known as a multirating table, and it shows the complete range of capacities for a particular size of fan.

Points to note:

*The multirating table shows the range of pressures and speeds possible within the limits of the fan's construction.
*A particular fan may be available in different construction classes (identified as class I through IV) relating to its capabilities and limits.
*For a given pressure, the highest mechanical efficiency is usually found in the middle third of the volume column.
*A fan operating at a given speed can have an infinite number of ratings (pressure and volume) along the length of its characteristic curve. However, when the fan is installed in a dust collection system, the point of rating can only be at the point at which the system resistance curve intersects the fan characteristic curve.
*In a given system, a fan at a fixed speed or at a fixed blade setting can have a single rating only. This rating can be changed only be changing the fan speed, blade setting, or the system resistance.
*For a given system, an increase in exhaust volume will result in increases in static and total pressures. For example, for a 20% increase in exhaust volume in a system with 5&amp;nbsp;in. pressure loss, the new pressure loss will be 5 × (1.20)² = 7.2&amp;nbsp;in.
*• For rapid estimates of probable exhaust volumes available for a given motor size, the equation for brake horsepower, as illustrated, can be useful.

Fan installation
Typical fan discharge conditions
Fan ratings for volume and static pressure, as described in the multirating tables, are based on the tests conducted under ideal conditions. Often, field installation creates airflow problems that reduce the fan's air delivery. The following points should be considered when installing the fan:

*Avoid installation of elbows or bends at the fan discharge, which will lower fan performance by increasing the system's resistance.
*Avoid installing fittings that may cause non-uniform flow, such as an elbow, mitred elbow, or square duct.
*Check that the fan impeller is rotating in the proper direction-clockwise or counterclockwise.
*For belt-driven fans:
**Check that the motor sheave and fan sheave are aligned properly.
**Check for proper belt tension.
*Check the passages between inlets, impeller blades, and inside of housing for buildup of dirt, obstructions, or trapped foreign matter.

===Electric motors===
{{Main|Electric motor}}
Electric motors are used to supply the necessary energy to drive the fan.

Integral-horsepower electric motors are normally three-phase, alternating-current motors. Fractional-horsepower electric motors are normally single-phase, alternating-current motors and are used when less than {{convert|1|hp|abbr=on}} is required. Since most dust collection systems require motors with more than {{convert|1|hp|abbr=on}}, only integral-horsepower motors are discussed here.

The two most common types of integral-horsepower motors used in [[dust collection system]]s are:

*Squirrel-cage motors - These motors have a constant speed and are of a nonsynchronous, induction type.
*Wound-rotor motors - These motors are also known as slip-ring motors. They are general-purpose or continuous-rated motors and are chiefly used when an adjustable-speed motor is desired.

Squirrel-cage and wound-rotor motors are further classified according to the type of enclosure they use to protect their interior windings. These enclosures fall into two broad categories:
*Open
*Totally enclosed

Drip-proof and splash-proof motors are open motors. They provide varying degrees of protection; however, they should not be used where the air contains substances that might be harmful to the interior of the motor.

Totally enclosed motors are weather-protected with the windings enclosed. These enclosures prevent free exchange of air between the inside and the outside, but they are not airtight.

Totally enclosed, fan-cooled (TEFC) motors are another kind of totally enclosed motor. These motors are the most commonly used motors in dust collection systems. They have an integral-cooling fan outside the enclosure, but within the protective shield, that directs air over the enclosure.

Both open and totally enclosed motors are available in [[explosion proof|explosion-proof and dust-ignition-proof models]] to protect against explosion and fire in hazardous environments.

Motors are selected to provide sufficient power to operate fans over the full range of process conditions (temperature and flow rate).
[[File:Dust collector.jpg|frame|center|Figure 1. [[Dust collection system]] example]]

===Configurations===
Dust collectors can be configured into one of five common types:
# Ambient units - Ambient units are free-hanging systems for use when applications limit the use of source-capture arms or ductwork.
# Collection booths - Collector booths require no ductwork, and allow the worker greater freedom of movement. They are often portable.
# Downdraft tables - A downdraft table is a self-contained portable filtration system that removes harmful particulates and returns filtered air back into the facility with no external ventilation required.
# Source collector or Portable units - Portable units are for collecting dust, mist, fumes, or smoke at the source.
# Stationary units - An example of a stationary collector is a baghouse.

===Parameters involved in specifying dust collectors===
Important parameters in specifying dust collectors include airflow the velocity of the air stream created by the vacuum producer; system power, the power of the system motor, usually specified in horsepower; storage capacity for dust and particles, and minimum particle size filtered by the unit. Other considerations when choosing a dust collection system include the temperature, moisture content, and the possibility of combustion of the dust being collected.

Systems for fine removal may only contain a single filtration system (such as a filter bag or cartridge). However, most units utilize a primary and secondary separation/filtration system. In many cases the heat or moisture content of dust can negatively affect the filter media of a baghouse or cartridge dust collector. A cyclone separator or dryer may be placed before these units to reduce heat or moisture content before reaching the filters. Furthermore, some units may have third and fourth stage filtration. All separation and filtration systems used within the unit should be specified.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Image 005.jpg|right]] --&gt;
A baghouse is an air pollution abatement device used to trap particulate by filtering gas streams through large fabric bags. They are typically made of glass fibers or fabric.

[[File:SCyclone.jpg|right]]
A cyclone separator is an apparatus for the separation, by centrifugal means, of fine particles suspended in air or gas.

[[File:Electrostatic p.jpg|right]]
Electrostatic precipitators are a type of air cleaner, which charges particles of dust by passing dust-laden air through a strong (50-100 kV) electrostatic field. This causes the particles to be attracted to oppositely charged plates so that they can be removed from the air stream.

An impinger system is a device in which particles are removed by impacting the aerosol particles into a liquid. Modular media type units combine a variety of specific filter modules in one unit. These systems can provide solutions to many air contaminant problems. A typical system incorporates a series of disposable or cleanable pre-filters, a disposable vee-bag or cartridge filter. HEPA or carbon final filter modules can also be added. Various models are available, including free-hanging or ducted installations, vertical or horizontal mounting, and fixed or portable configurations. Filter cartridges are made out of a variety of synthetic fibers and are capable of collecting sub-micrometre particles without creating an excessive pressure drop in the system. Filter cartridges require periodic cleaning.

A wet scrubber, or venturi scrubber, is similar to a cyclone but it has an orifice unit that sprays water into the vortex in the cyclone section, collecting all of the dust in a slurry system. The water media can be recirculated and reused to continue to filter the air. Eventually the solids must be removed from the water stream and disposed of.

====Filter cleaning methods====
'''Online cleaning''' – automatically timed filter cleaning which allows for continuous, uninterrupted dust collector operation for heavy dust operations.

'''Offline cleaning''' – filter cleaning accomplished during dust collector shut down. Practical whenever the dust loading in each dust collector cycle does not exceed the filter capacity. Allows for maximum effectiveness in dislodging and disposing of dust.

'''On-demand cleaning''' – filter cleaning initiated automatically when the filter is fully loaded, as determined by a specified drop in pressure across the media surface.

'''Reverse-pulse/Reverse-jet cleaning''' – Filter cleaning method which delivers blasts of compressed air from the clean side of the filter to dislodge the accumulated dust cake.

'''Impact/Rapper cleaning''' – Filter cleaning method in which high-velocity compressed air forced through a flexible tube results in an arbitrary rapping of the filter to dislodge the dust cake. Especially effective when the dust is extremely fine or sticky.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3540">The '''[[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] BladeUPS''' is a modular [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[Uninterruptible power supply|UPS]] system consisting of individual [[Rack unit|6U]] 12 [[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] UPS units which can be paralleled together to create up to a 60&amp;nbsp;kW [[N+1 Redundancy|N+1]] redundant UPS.  A feature of the BladeUPS is that the 6U cabinet houses both the UPS electronics and batteries; other modular systems house them separately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=ISX20K20F&amp;tab=components&amp;bstatus=1&lt;/ref&gt;  The high power density and 6U form factor of the BladeUPS are targeted at the growing power demands of IT servers and equipment, especially [[Blade Server|blade servers]].
[[Image:Bladeups1.jpg|thumb|Eaton BladeUPS mounted in a 19-inch rack]]
The BladeUPS does not fall into a defined category for UPS type as it is a hybrid of a [[Uninterruptible_power_supply#Line-interactive|line interactive]] and [[Uninterruptible_power_supply#Double-conversion / online|online architecture]], which Eaton calls [[Uninterruptible_power_supply#Hybrid topology / double conversion on demand|Double Conversion on Demand]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.42u.com/powerware.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  During normal operation the BladeUPS operates as a line interactive UPS allowing it to be energy efficient.  When power conditions fluctuate outside preset standards, the unit switches into online mode (also known as double conversion).  Software upgrades by Eaton have allowed BladeUPS owners to defeat this hybrid architecture and force the unit to operate entirely in online (double conversion) mode.

==Software==
BladeUPS ships with Eaton’s LanSafe software which allows for UPS monitoring and commands.  The BladeUPS is compatible with Eaton’s Power Xpert and FORESEER software which provide additional monitoring and functionality.&lt;ref name="lit.powerware.com"&gt;http://lit.powerware.com/ll_download.asp?file=BLADEUPS02FXA_Final.545.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battery runtime==
Up to four extended battery modules can be connected to each BladeUPS providing additional runtime.

'''Firefighting foam''' is a [[foam]] used for [[fire suppression]]. Its role is to cool the fire and to coat the fuel, preventing its contact with oxygen, resulting in suppression of the [[combustion]]. Fire-fighting foam was invented by the Russian engineer and chemist [[Aleksandr Loran]] in 1902.&lt;ref name="loran"&gt;[http://p-lab.org/publ/7-1-0-15 Loran and the fire extinguisher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727161356/http://p-lab.org/publ/7-1-0-15 |date=27 July 2011 }} at p-lab.org {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[surfactant]]s used must produce foam in concentration of less than 1%. Other components of fire-retardant foams are organic [[solvent]]s (e.g., trimethyl-[[1,3-Propanediol|trimethylene glycol]] and [[2-Methyl-2,4-pentanediol|hexylene glycol]]), foam stabilizers (e.g., [[Dodecanol|lauryl alcohol]]), and [[corrosion inhibitor]]s.

==Overview==
* Low-expansion foams such as AFFF, have an expansion rate less than 20 times are low-viscosity, mobile, and can quickly cover large areas.
* Medium-expansion foams have an expansion ratio of 20–100. 
* High-expansion foams have an expansion ratio over 200–1000 and are suitable for enclosed spaces such as hangars, where quick filling is needed.
* Alcohol-resistant foams contain a polymer that forms a protective layer between the burning surface and the foam, preventing foam breakdown by alcohols in the burning fuel. Alcohol-resistant foams are used in fighting fires of fuels containing [[oxygenate]]s, e.g. [[MTBE]], or fires of liquids based on or containing [[polar molecule|polar]] solvents.

==Class A foams==
[[Image:Water Tender CAFS demo.jpg|thumb|right|A fire truck demonstrating Class A foam in a [[Compressed Air Foam System|CAFS]] system]]
'''Class A foams''' were developed in mid-1980s for fighting [[wildfire]]s. Class A foams lower the surface tension of the water, which assists in the wetting and saturation of Class A fuels with water. This aids fire suppression and can prevent reignition.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Favorable experiences led to its acceptance for fighting other types of [[fire classes|class A fires]], including structure fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wfrfire.com/website/articles/foam2.htm |title=Class A Foam: Q &amp; A |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929003927/http://www.wfrfire.com/website/articles/foam2.htm |archivedate=29 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Class B foams==
Class B foams are designed for [[class B fire]]s—flammable liquids. The use of class A foam on a class B fire may yield unexpected results, as class A foams are not designed to contain the explosive vapors produced by flammable liquids. Class B foams have two major subtypes.

===Synthetic foams===
Synthetic foams are based on synthetic [[surfactant]]s. They provide better flow and spreading over the surface of hydrocarbon-based liquids, for faster knockdown of flames. They have limited post-fire security and are toxic groundwater contaminants.
* Aqueous film forming foams (AFFF) are water-based and frequently contain hydrocarbon-based surfactant such as [[sodium alkyl sulfate]], and [[fluorosurfactant]], such as [[fluorotelomer]]s, [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA), or [[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS). 
* Alcohol-resistant aqueous film-forming foams (AR-AFFF) are foams resistant to the action of [[alcohol]]s and can form a protective film.

===Protein foams===
Protein foams contain natural [[protein]]s as the foaming agents. Unlike synthetic foams, protein foams are [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]]. They flow and spread slower, but provide a foam blanket that is more heat-resistant and more durable.

Protein foams include regular protein foam (P), fluoroprotein foam (FP), film-forming fluoroprotein (FFFP),&lt;ref&gt;Clause 1 BS 5306-6.1&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}} alcohol-resistant fluoroprotein foam (AR-FP), and alcohol-resistant film-forming fluoroprotein (AR-FFFP).

Protein foam from non-animal sources is preferred, because of the possible threats of biological contaminants such as [[prions]].

==Applications==
Every type of foam has its application. High-expansion foams are used when an enclosed space, such as a basement or hangar, must be quickly filled. Low-expansion foams are used on burning spills. AFFF is best for spills of jet fuels, FFFP is better for cases where the burning fuel can form deeper pools, and AR-AFFF is suitable for burning alcohols. The most flexibility is achieved by AR-AFFF or AR-FFFP. AR-AFFF must be used in areas where gasolines are blended with oxygenates, since the alcohols prevent the formation of the film between the FFFP foam and the gasoline, breaking down the foam, rendering the FFFP foam virtually useless.

==History of fire-fighting foams==
{{Advert|section|date=February 2015}} 
Water has long been a universal agent for suppressing fires, but is not best in all cases. For example, water is typically ineffective on oil fires, and can be dangerous. Fire-fighting foams were a development for extinguishing oil fires.

In 1902, a method of extinguishing flammable liquid fires by blanketing them with foam was introduced by Russian engineer and chemist [[Aleksandr Loran]]. Loran was a teacher in a school in [[Baku]], the center of the Russian [[oil industry]] at that time. Impressed by large, difficult-to-extinguish oil fires that he had seen there, Loran tried to find a liquid substance that could deal effectively with them. He invented fire-fighting foam, which was successfully tested in experiments in 1902 and 1903.&lt;ref name="loran"/&gt; In 1904 Loran patented his invention, and developed the first [[Fire extinguisher#Foams|foam extinguisher]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terra-incognita.at.ua/news/2009-03-19-14 The history of fire extinguisher] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original foam was a mixture of two powders and water produced in a foam generator. It was called chemical foam because of the chemical action to create it. In general, the powders used were [[sodium bicarbonate]] and [[aluminium sulfate]], with small amounts of [[saponin]] or [[liquorice]] added to stabilise the bubbles. Hand-held foam extinguishers used the same two chemicals in solution. To actuate the extinguisher, a seal was broken and the unit inverted, allowing the liquids to mix and react. Chemical foam is a stable solution of small bubbles containing [[carbon dioxide]] with lower density than oil or water, and exhibits persistence for covering flat surfaces. Because it is lighter than the burning liquid, it flows freely over the liquid surface and extinguishes the fire by a smothering (removal/prevention of oxygen) action. Chemical foam is considered obsolete today because of the many containers of powder required, even for small fires.

In the 1940s, [[Percy Lavon Julian]] developed an improved type of foam called [[Aerofoam]]. Using mechanical action, a liquid [[protein]]-based concentrate, made from [[soy protein]], was mixed with water in either a proportioner or an aerating nozzle to form air bubbles with the free-flowing action. Its expansion ratio and ease of handling made it popular. Protein foam is easily contaminated by some flammable liquids, so care should be used so that the foam is applied only above the burning liquid. Protein foam has slow knockdown characteristics, but it is economical for post-fire security.

In the early 1950s, high-expansion foam was conceived by [[Herbert Eisner]] in England at the Safety in Mines Research Establishment (now the [http://www.hsl.gov.uk Health &amp; Safety Laboratory]) to fight coal mine fires. Will B. Jamison, a Pennsylvania Mining Engineer, read about the proposed foam in 1952, requested more information about the idea. He proceeded to work with the US Bureau of Mines on the idea, testing 400 formulas until a suitable compound was found. In 1964, Walter Kidde &amp; Company (now [[Kidde]]) bought the patents for high expansion foam.&lt;ref name = "PM Feb 1966"&gt;{{cite magazine | last =Kearney | first = Paul | title = Shut the Windows! |magazine= Popular Mechanics | volume = 125 | issue = 2 | pages =136–139, 210–212 | publisher = Hearst Magazines| date = February 1966 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8dMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA210| issn = 0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, [[National Foam, Inc.]] developed [[fluoroprotein]] foam. Its active agent is a [[fluorinated surfactant]] that provides an oil-rejecting property to prevent contamination. In general, it is better than protein foam because its longer blanket life provides better safety when entry is required for rescue. Fluoroprotein foam has fast knockdown characteristics and it can also be used together with dry chemicals that destroy protein foam.

In the mid-1960s, the US Navy developed aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF). This synthetic foam has a low viscosity and spreads rapidly across the surface of most [[hydrocarbon]] fuels. A water film forms beneath the foam, which cools the liquid fuel, stopping the formation of flammable vapors. This provides dramatic fire knockdown, an important factor in crash rescue fire fighting.

In the early 1970s, National Foam, Inc. invented Alcohol-Resistant AFFF technology. AR-AFFF is a synthetic foam developed for both hydrocarbon and [[Solvent effects|polar-solvent]] materials. Polar solvents are combustible liquids that destroy conventional fire-fighting foam. These solvents extract the water contained in the foam, breaking down the foam blanket. Hence, these fuels require an alcohol- or polar-solvent-resistant foam. Alcohol-resistant foam must be bounced off of a surface and allowed to flow down and over the liquid to form its membrane, compared to standard AFFF that can be sprayed directly onto the fire.

In 1993, Pyrocool Technologies Inc. acquired the patent rights to a wetting agent with superior cooling properties that is effective on Class A, Class B, Class D as well as pressurized and 3-dimensional fires involving both hydro carbon based fuels and polar solvents such as alcohol and ethanol.  The wetting agent is marketed under the name of Pyrocool.  Pyrocool Technologies Inc. was awarded the 1998 Presidential Green Chemistry Award by the USEPA. Carol Browner, the USEPA Administrator in 1998, described Pyrocool as the “Technology for the Third Millennium: The Development and Commercial Introduction of an Environmentally Responsible Fire Extinguishment and Cooling Agent”.

In 2010, Orchidee International of France developed the first FFHPF, the highest performing fluorine-free foam. The foam has achieved a 97% degradability rating and is currently marketed by Orchidee International under the brand name "BluFoam". The foam is used at 3% both on hydrocarbon and polar solvent fires.

The '''Gas Technology Institute''' is an [[Americans|American]] non-profit [[research and development]] organization which develops, demonstrates, and licenses new energy technologies for private and public clients, with a particular focus on the [[natural gas]] industry.  GTI is located in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]].

==History==

The Institute of Gas Technology was founded in 1941 at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT).&lt;ref name="tribune1941"&gt;Staff report (October 12, 1941). Million dollar gas institute opened at IIT.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gas Research Institute was founded in 1976 by the federal government.&lt;ref name="dye1985"&gt;Dye, Lee (June 3, 1985). 'Maverick' oil scientists find taker. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by a tax on interstate shipments of natural gas&lt;ref&gt;Gas Technology Institute, [http://www.gastechnology.org/About/Pages/History.aspx History], accessed 12 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the tax that funded the Gas Research Institute was phased out.  The Institute of Gas Technology and the Gas Research Institute combined to form the Gas Technology Institute.&lt;ref name="merge2000"&gt;Staff report (June 1, 2000). Institute of Gas Technology, Gas Research Institute merge. ''LP/Gas''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the IIT building that formerly housed the institute became home to [[Shimer College]], which took up residence there after moving from [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/so-long-shimer/Content?oid=925775|title=So Long, Shimer|first=Deanna|last=Isaacs|date=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8899">In [[physics]], the '''Gell-Mann–Okubo mass formula''' provides a [[sum rule in quantum mechanics|sum rule]] for the masses of [[hadron]]s within a specific multiplet, determined by their [[isospin]] (''I'') and [[strangeness]] (or alternatively, [[hypercharge]])
:&lt;math&gt;M = a_0 + a_1 Y + a_2 \left[ I \left( I + 1 \right)-\frac{1}{4} Y^2 \right] ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[free parameter]]s.

The rule was first formulated by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] in 1961&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isospin and hypercharge are generated by [[SU(3)]], which can be represented by [[Gell-Mann matrices|eight hermitian and traceless matrices]] corresponding to the "components" of isospin and hypercharge. Six of the matrices correspond to flavor change, and the final two correspond to the third-component of isospin projection, and hypercharge.

==Theory==
The mass formula was obtained by considering the [[Lie algebra representation|representations]] of the [[Lie algebra]] [[su(3)]]. In particular, the meson octet corresponds to the [[root system]] of the [[adjoint endomorphism|adjoint representation]]. However, the simplest, lowest-dimensional representation of su(3) is the [[fundamental representation]], which is three-dimensional, and is now understood to describe the approximate [[flavor symmetry]] of the three [[quark]]s ''u'', ''d'', and ''s''. Thus, the discovery of not only an su(3) symmetry, but also of this workable formula for the [[mass spectrum]] was one of the earliest indicators for the existence of quarks.

The formula is underlain by the ''octet enhancement hypothesis'', which ascribes dominance of SU(3) breaking to the hypercharge generator  of SU(3), 
&lt;math&gt;Y=\tfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}}F_8=\operatorname{diag}(1,1,-2)/3~&lt;/math&gt;,
and, in modern terms, the relatively higher mass of the strange quark. An elegant abstract derivation of it is available  in Ch. 1.3.5 and  1.4 of S. Coleman's text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Sidney Coleman

This formula is ''phenomenological'', describing an approximate relation between meson and baryon masses, and has been superseded as theoretical work in [[quantum chromodynamics]] advances, notably chiral perturbation theory.

Using the values of relevant ''I'' and ''S'' for baryons, the Gell-Mann–Okubo formula can be rewritten for the baryon octet,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N + \Xi}{2} = \frac{3 \Lambda + \Sigma}{4} \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''N'', &amp;Lambda;, &amp;Sigma;, and &amp;Xi; represent the average mass of corresponding baryons. Using the current mass of baryons,&lt;ref name=PDG/&gt; this yields:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{N + \Xi}{2} = 1128.5~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{3 \Lambda + \Sigma}{4} = 1135.25~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that the Gell-Mann–Okubo formula reproduces the mass of octet baryons within ~0.5% of measured values.

For the baryon decuplet, the Gell-Mann–Okubo formula can be rewritten as the "equal-spacing" rule
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta -\Sigma^* = \Sigma^* - \Xi^* = \Xi^* - \Omega = a_1 + 2a_2 \approx \, -147 ~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;Delta;, &amp;Sigma;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;Xi;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and &amp;Omega; represent the average mass of corresponding baryons.

The baryon decuplet formula famously allowed Gell-Mann to predict the mass of the then undiscovered &amp;Omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

== Mesons ==
The same mass relation can be found for the meson octet,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{ K^- + \bar{K}^0 }{2} + \frac{ K^+ + K^0}{2}}{2} = \frac{3\eta + \pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
Using the current mass of mesons,&lt;ref name=PDG/&gt; this yields
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\frac{ K^- + \bar{K}^0 }{2} + \frac{ K^+ + K^0}{2}}{2} = 496~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{3\eta + \pi}{4} = 445~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Because of this large discrepancy, several people attempted to find a way to understand the failure of the GMO formula in mesons, when it worked so well in baryons. In particular, people noticed that using the square of the average masses yielded much better results:&lt;ref&gt;

 |year=1987
 |title=Introduction to Elementary Particles
 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]
 |isbn=978-0-471-60386-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \left( \frac{ K^- + \bar{K}^0 }{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{ K^+ + K^0}{2} \right)^2}2 = \frac{3\eta^2 + \pi^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
This now yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \left( \frac{ K^- + \bar{K}^0 }{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{ K^+ + K^0}{2} \right)^2}2 = 246\times10^3~\mathrm{MeV^2}/c^4&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3\eta^2 + \pi^2}{4} = 230\times10^3~\mathrm{MeV^2}/c^4&lt;/math&gt;
which fall within 5% of each other.

For a while, the GMO formula involving the square of masses was simply an [[empirical relationship]]; but later a justification for using the square of masses was found&lt;ref&gt;

Other, mesons, such as vector ones, need no squaring for the GMO formula to work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29794">In [[condensed matter physics]], the term '''geometrical frustration''' (or in short: '''frustration'''&lt;ref&gt;The psychological side of this problem is treated in a different article, [[frustration]]&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to a phenomenon, where [[atom]]s tend to stick to non-trivial positions{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} or where, on a regular [[crystal lattice]], conflicting inter-atomic forces (each one favoring rather simple, but different structures) lead to quite complex structures. As a consequence of the frustration in the geometry or in the forces, a plenitude of distinct [[ground state]]s may result at zero temperature, and usual thermal ordering may be suppressed at higher temperatures. Much studied examples are [[amorphous]] materials, [[glass]]es, or dilute [[magnet]]s.

The term ''frustration'', in the context of [[magnetism|magnetic]] systems, has been introduced by [[Gerard Toulouse]] (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=J. |last1=Vannimenus|first2=G.|last2=Toulouse|title=Theory of the frustration effect.

Early work includes a study of the [[Ising model]] on a triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor [[spin (physics)|spin]]s coupled [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetically]], by [[Gregory Wannier|G.

A renewed interest in such spin systems with frustrated or competing interactions arose about two decades later, beginning in the 1970s, in the context of [[spin glass]]es and spatially modulated magnetic superstructures.

Geometrical frustration is an important feature in [[magnetism]], where it stems from the relative arrangement of [[spin (physics)|spin]]s. A simple 2D example is shown in Figure 1. Three magnetic ions reside on the corners of a triangle with [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] interactions between them; the energy is minimized when each spin is aligned opposite to neighbors. Once the first two spins align antiparallel, the third one is ''frustrated'' because its two possible orientations, up and down, give the same energy. The third spin cannot simultaneously minimize its interactions with both of the other two. Since this effect occurs for each spin, the ground state is sixfold [[degenerate energy level|degenerate]]. Only the two states where all spins are up or down have more energy.

Similarly in three dimensions, four spins arranged in a [[tetrahedron]] (Figure 2) may experience geometric frustration. If there is an antiferromagnetic interaction between spins, then it is not possible to arrange the spins so that all interactions between spins are antiparallel. There are six nearest-neighbor interactions, four of which are antiparallel and thus favourable, but two of which (between 1 and 2, and between 3 and 4) are unfavourable. It is impossible to have all interactions favourable, and the system is frustrated.

Geometrical frustration is also possible if the spins are arranged in a non-[[Line (geometry)|collinear]] way. If we consider a tetrahedron with a spin on each vertex pointing along the ''easy axis'' (that is, directly towards or away from the centre of the tetrahedron), then it is possible to arrange the four spins so that there is no net spin (Figure 3). This is exactly equivalent to having an antiferromagnetic interaction between each pair of spins, so in this case there is no geometrical frustration. With these axes, geometric frustration arises if there is a [[ferromagnetic]] interaction between neighbours, where energy is minimized by parallel spins. The best possible arrangement is shown in Figure 4, with two spins pointing towards the centre and two pointing away. The net [[magnetic moment]] points upwards, maximising ferromagnetic interactions in this direction, but left and right vectors cancel out (i.e. are antiferromagnetically aligned), as do forwards and backwards. There are three different equivalent arrangements with two spins out and two in, so the ground state is three-fold degenerate.

==Mathematical definition==
The mathematical definition is simple (and analogous to the so-called [[Wilson loop]] in [[Quantum chromodynamics]]): One considers for example expressions ("total energies" or "Hamiltonians") of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal H=\sum_G\,-I_{k_\nu , k_\mu}\,\,S_{k_\nu}\cdot S_{k_\mu}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the graph considered, whereas the quantities {{nowrap|''I''&lt;sub&gt;''k&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'',''k&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the so-called "exchange energies" between nearest-neighbours, which (in the energy units considered) assume the values ±1 (mathematically, this is a [[signed graph]]), while the {{nowrap|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt;·''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are inner products of scalar or vectorial spins or pseudo-spins. If the graph ''G'' has quadratic or triangular faces ''P'', the so-called "plaquette variables" ''P&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;'', "loop-products" of the following kind, appear:
:&lt;math&gt;P_W=I_{1,2}\,I_{2,3}\,I_{3,4}\,I_{4,1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_W=I_{1,2}\,I_{2,3}\,I_{3,1}\,,&lt;/math&gt; respectively,

which are also called "frustration products". One has to perform a sum over these products, summed over all plaquettes. The result for a single plaquette is either +1 or −1. In the last-mentioned case the plaquette is "geometrically frustrated".

It can be shown that the result has a simple [[gauge invariance]]: it does ''not'' change &amp;ndash; nor do other measurable quantities, e.g. the "total energy" &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; – even if locally the exchange integrals and the spins are simultaneously modified as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;I_{i,k}\to\varepsilon_i I_{i,k}\varepsilon_k ,\quad S_i\to\varepsilon_i S_i ,\quad S_k\to \varepsilon_k S_k\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Here the numbers ''ε&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''ε&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are arbitrary signs, i.e. +1 or −1, so that the modified structure may look totally random.

==Water ice==
[[Image:Water ice.png|frame|left|'''Figure 5:''' Scheme of water ice molecules]]
Although most previous and current research on frustration focuses on spin systems, the phenomenon was first studied in ordinary [[ice]]. In 1936 Giauque and Stout published ''The Entropy of Water and the Third Law of Thermodynamics. Heat Capacity of Ice from 15&amp;nbsp;K to 273&amp;nbsp;K'', reporting [[calorimeter]] measurements on water through the freezing and vaporization transitions up to the high temperature gas phase. The [[entropy]] was calculated by integrating the [[heat capacity]] and adding the [[latent heat]] contributions; the low temperature measurements were extrapolated to zero, using Debye’s then recently derived formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=Peter Debye|last=Debye|first=P.|title=Zur Theorie der spezifischen Wärmen|trans-title=On the theory of specific heats|doi=10.1002/andp.19123441404|journal=Ann. Phys.|volume=344|issue=14|pages=789–839|year=1912|bibcode = 1912AnP...344..789D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting entropy, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 44.28&amp;nbsp;cal/(K·mol)&amp;nbsp;= 185.3&amp;nbsp;J/(mol·K) was compared to the theoretical result from statistical mechanics of an ideal gas, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 45.10&amp;nbsp;cal/(K·mol)&amp;nbsp;= 188.7&amp;nbsp;J/(mol·K). The two values differ by ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0.82&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.05&amp;nbsp;cal/(K·mol)&amp;nbsp;= 3.4&amp;nbsp;J/(mol·K). This result was then explained by [[Linus Pauling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pauling |first=Linus |author-link=Linus Pauling |title=The Structure and Entropy of Ice and of Other Crystals with Some Randomness of Atomic Arrangement |doi=10.1021/ja01315a102|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=2680–2684|year=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an excellent approximation, who showed that ice possesses a finite entropy (estimated as 0.81&amp;nbsp;cal/(K·mol) or 3.4&amp;nbsp;J/(mol·K)) at zero temperature due to the configurational disorder intrinsic to the protons in ice.

In the [[hexagonal]] or [[cubic crystal system|cubic]] [[Ice#Phases|ice phase]] the [[oxygen]] ions form a tetrahedral structure with an O–O bond length 2.76&amp;nbsp;[[angstrom|Å]] (276&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]]), while the O–H bond length measures only 0.96&amp;nbsp;Å (96&amp;nbsp;pm). Every oxygen (white) ion is surrounded by four hydrogen ions (black) and each hydrogen ion is surrounded by 2 oxygen ions, as shown in Figure 5. Maintaining the internal H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule structure, the minimum energy position of a proton is not half-way between two adjacent oxygen ions. There are two equivalent positions a hydrogen may occupy on the line of the O–O bond, a far and a near position. Thus a rule leads to the frustration of positions of the proton for a ground state configuration: for each oxygen two of the neighboring protons must reside in the far position and two of them in the near position, so-called ‘[[ice rules]]’. Pauling proposed that the open tetrahedral structure of ice affords many equivalent states satisfying the ice rules.

Pauling went on to compute the configurational entropy in the following way: consider one mole of ice, consisting of ''N'' O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and 2''N'' protons. Each O–O bond has two positions for a proton, leading to 2&lt;sup&gt;2''N''&lt;/sup&gt; possible configurations. However, among the 16 possible configurations associated with each oxygen, only 6 are energetically favorable, maintaining the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule constraint. Then an upper bound of the numbers that the ground state can take is estimated as ''Ω''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2''N''&lt;/sup&gt;({{sfrac|6|16}})&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;. Correspondingly the configurational entropy ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;ln(''Ω'')&amp;nbsp;= ''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;ln({{sfrac|3|2}})&amp;nbsp;= 0.81&amp;nbsp;cal/(K·mol)&amp;nbsp;= 3.4&amp;nbsp;J/(mol·K) is in amazing agreement with the missing entropy measured by Giauque and Stout.

Although Pauling’s calculation neglected both the global constraint on the number of protons and the local constraint arising from closed loops on the Wurtzite lattice, the estimate was subsequently shown to be of excellent accuracy.

==Spin ice==
[[Image:SpinIce.svg|frame|right|'''Figure 6:''' Scheme of spin ice molecules]]
A mathematically analogous situation to the degeneracy in water ice is found in the [[spin ice]]s. A common spin ice structure is shown in Figure 6 in the cubic pyrochlore structure with one magnetic atom or ion residing on each of the four corners. Due to the strong [[crystal field theory|crystal field]] in the material, each of the magnetic ions can be represented by an Ising ground state doublet with a large moment. This suggests a picture of Ising spins residing on the corner-sharing tetrahedral lattice with spins fixed along the local quantization axis, the [[Miller index|&lt;111&gt; cubic axes]], which coincide with the lines connecting each tetrahedral vertex to the center. Every tetrahedral cell must have two spins pointing in and two pointing out in order to minimize the energy. Currently the spin ice model has been approximately realized by real materials, most notably the rare earth pyrochlores [[Holmium titanate|Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Dysprosium titanate|Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[Holmium stannate|Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]]. These materials all show nonzero residual entropy at low temperature.

==Extension of Pauling’s model: General frustration==

The spin ice model is only one subdivision of frustrated systems. The word frustration was initially introduced to describe a system’s inability to simultaneously minimize the competing interaction energy between its components. In general frustration is caused either by competing interactions due to site disorder (see also the ''Villain model''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author-link=Jacques Villain|last=Villain|first=J.|title=Spin glass with non-random interactions|doi=10.1088/0022-3719/10/10/014|journal=J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys.|volume=10|issue=10|pages=1717–1734|year=1977|bibcode = 1977JPhC...10.1717V }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by lattice structure such as in the [[Triangular tiling|triangular]], [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (fcc), [[Hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal-close-packed]], [[tetrahedron]], [[pyrochlore]] and [[kagome lattice]]s with antiferromagnetic interaction. So frustration is divided into two categories: the first corresponds to the [[spin glass]], which has both disorder in structure and frustration in spin; the second is the geometrical frustration with an ordered lattice structure and frustration of spin. The frustration of a spin glass is understood within the framework of the [[RKKY]] model, in which the interaction property, either ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic, is dependent on the distance of the two magnetic ions. Due to the lattice disorder in the spin glass, one spin of interest and its nearest neighbors could be at different distances and have a different interaction property, which thus leads to different preferred alignment of the spin.

==Artificial geometrically frustrated ferromagnets==
With the help of lithography techniques, it is possible to fabricate sub-micrometer size magnetic islands whose geometric arrangement reproduces the frustration found in naturally occurring spin ice materials. Recently R. F. Wang et al. reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These islands are manually arranged to create a two-dimensional analog to spin ice. The magnetic moments of the ordered ‘spin’ islands were imaged with [[magnetic force microscope|magnetic force microscopy (MFM)]] and then the local accommodation of frustration was thoroughly studied. In their previous work on a square lattice of frustrated magnets, they observed both ice-like short-range correlations and the absence of long-range correlations, just like in the spin ice at low temperature. These results solidify the uncharted ground on which the real physics of frustration can be visualized and modeled by these artificial geometrically frustrated magnets, and inspires further research activity.

These artificially frustrated ferromagnets can exhibit unique magnetic properties when studying their global response to an external field using Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohli|first=K.

== Geometric Frustration without Lattice ==
Another type of geometrical frustration arises from the propagation of a local order. A main question that a condensed matter physicist faces is to explain the stability of a solid.

It is sometimes possible to establish some local rules, of chemical nature, which lead to low energy configurations and therefore govern structural and chemical order. This is not generally the case and often the local order defined by local interactions cannot propagate freely, leading to geometric frustration. A common feature of all these systems is that, even with simple local rules, they present a large set of, often complex, structural realizations. Geometric frustration plays a role in fields of condensed matter, ranging from clusters and amorphous solids to complex fluids.

The general method of approach to resolve these complications follows two steps. First, the constraint of perfect space-filling is relaxed by allowing for space curvature. An ideal, unfrustrated, structure is defined in this curved space. Then, specific distortions are applied to this ideal template in order to embed it into three dimensional Euclidean space. The final structure is a mixture of ordered regions, where the local order is similar to that of the template, and defects arising from the embedding. Among the possible defects, disclinations play an important role.
[[Image:frustrationPentagons.jpg|thumb|Tiling of a plane by pentagons is impossible but can be realized on a sphere in the form of pentagonal dodecahedron as demonstrated in [[quasicrystals]]]]

===Simple two-dimensional examples===
Two-dimensional examples are helpful in order to get some understanding about the origin of the competition between local rules and geometry in the large. Consider first an arrangement of identical discs (a model for a hypothetical two-dimensional metal) on a plane; we suppose that the interaction between discs is isotropic and locally tends to arrange the disks in the densest way as possible. The best arrangement for three disks is trivially an equilateral triangle with the disk centers located at the triangle vertices. The study of the long range structure can therefore be reduced to that of plane tilings with equilateral triangles. A well known solution is provided by the triangular tiling with a total compatibility between the local and global rules: the system is said to be "unfrustrated".

But now, the interaction energy is supposed to be at a minimum when atoms sit on the vertices of a regular [[pentagon]]. Trying to propagate in the long range a packing of these pentagons sharing edges (atomic bonds) and vertices (atoms) is impossible. This is due to the impossibility of tiling a plane with regular pentagons, simply because the pentagon vertex angle does not divide 2{{pi}}. Three such pentagons can easily fit at a common vertex, but a gap remains between two edges. It is this kind of discrepancy which is called "geometric frustration". There is one way to overcome this difficulty. Let the surface to be tiled be free of any presupposed topology, and let us build the tiling with a strict application of the local interaction rule. In this simple example, we observe that the surface inherits the topology of a sphere and so receives a curvature. The final structure, here a pentagonal dodecahedron, allows for a perfect propagation of the pentagonal order. It is called an "ideal" (defect-free) model for the considered structure.

===Dense structures and tetrahedral packings===
[[Image:FrustrationIcosaedre.jpg|thumb|Tetrahedral packing: The [[dihedral angle]] of a tetrahedron is not [[commensurability (mathematics)|commensurable]] with 2{{pi}}; consequently, a hole remains between two faces of a packing of five tetrahedra with a common edge. A packing of twenty tetrahedra with a common vertex in such a way that the twelve outer vertices form an irregular icosahedron]]

The stability of metals is a longstanding question of solid state physics, which can only be understood in the quantum mechanical framework by properly taking into account the interaction between the positively charged ions and the valence and conduction electrons. It is nevertheless possible to use a very simplified picture of metallic bonding and only keeps an isotropic type of interactions, leading to structures which can be represented as densely packed spheres. And indeed the crystalline simple metal structures are often either close packed [[face centered cubic]] (fcc) or [[hexagonal close packing]] (hcp) lattices. Up to some extent amorphous metals and [[quasicrystals]] can also be modeled by close packing of spheres. The local atomic order is well modeled by a close packing of tetrahedra, leading to an imperfect icosahedral order.

A regular tetrahedron is the densest configuration for the packing of four equal spheres. The dense random packing of hard spheres problem can thus be mapped on the [[tetrahedron packing|tetrahedral packing problem]]. It is a practical exercise to try to pack table tennis balls in order to form only tetrahedral configurations. One starts with four balls arranged as a perfect tetrahedron, and try to add new spheres, while forming new tetrahedra. The next solution, with five balls, is trivially two tetrahedra sharing a common face; note that already with this solution, the fcc structure, which contains individual tetrahedral holes, does not show such a configuration (the tetrahedra share edges, not faces). With six balls, three regular tetrahedra are built, and the cluster is incompatible with all compact crystalline structures (fcc and hcp). Adding a seventh sphere gives a new cluster consisting in two "axial" balls touching each other and five others touching the latter two balls, the outer shape being an almost regular pentagonal bi-pyramid. However, we are facing now a real packing problem, analogous to the one encountered above with the pentagonal tiling in two dimensions. The dihedral angle of a tetrahedron is not commensurable with 2{{pi}}; consequently, a hole remains between two faces of neighboring tetrahedra. As a consequence, a perfect tiling of the Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''3''&lt;/sup&gt; is impossible with regular tetrahedra. The frustration has a topological character: it is impossible to fill Euclidean space with tetrahedra, even severely distorted, if we impose that a constant number of tetrahedra (here five) share a common edge.

The next step is crucial: the search for an unfrustrated structure by allowing for curvature in the space, in order for the local configurations to propagate identically and without defects throughout the whole space.

===Regular packing of tetrahedra: the polytope {3,3,5}===
[[File:Schlegel wireframe 600-cell vertex-centered.png|thumb|right|250px|[[600-cell]]: polytope {3,3,5}]]
Twenty tetrahedra pack with a common vertex in such a way that the twelve outer vertices form an irregular icosahedron. Indeed the icosahedron edge length ''l'' is slightly longer than the circumsphere radius ''r'' (''l''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1.05''r''). There is a solution with regular icosahedra if the space is not Euclidean, but spherical. It is the [[polytope]] {3,3,5}, using the [[Schläfli symbol|Schläfli]] notation, also known as the [[600-cell]].

There are one hundred and twenty vertices which all belong to the hypersphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with radius equal to the [[golden ratio]] (''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1 + {{sqrt|5}}|2}}) if the edges are of unit length. The six hundred cells are regular tetrahedra grouped by five around a common edge and by twenty around a common vertex. This structure is called a polytope (see [[Coxeter]]) which is the general name in higher dimension in the series containing polygons and polyhedra. Even if this structure is embedded in four dimensions, it has been considered as a three dimensional (curved) manifold. This point is conceptually important for the following reason. The ideal models that have been introduced in the curved Space are three dimensional curved templates. They look locally as three dimensional Euclidean models. So, the {3,3,5} polytope, which is a tiling by tetrahedra, provides a very dense atomic structure if atoms are located on its vertices. It is therefore naturally used as a template for amorphous metals, but one should not forget that it is at the price of successive idealizations.

==History==
The corporation was established in 1983 to replace the Petroleum Department which was an agency under the Ministry of Fuel and Power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ghananewsagency.org/economics/gnpc-wins-two-awards-126974 | title =GNPC wins two awards | last =Yire | first =Iddi | date =2017-12-31 | publisher =Ghana News Agency | access-date =2018-05-21 | quote =GNPC was established in 1983 under the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) Law 1983, PNDC Law 64 and started operations in 1985. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://secghana.gov.gh/soes/energy-and-petroleum/ghana-national-petroleum-corporation-gnpc/ | title =Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) | publisher =State Enterprises Commission - Ghana | access-date =2018-05-21 | quote =Prior to the establishment of GNPC in 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The department was responsible for the importation of crude oil and [[petroleum products]] for the Ghanaian economy.&lt;ref name=ABOUT/&gt; The mandate for oil exploration was held to be the Technical Directorate of the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Geological Survey Department. The corporation was created to promote the Government of Ghana's objective of supplying adequate and reliable petroleum for the country and the discovery of crude oil in the country's territories.

==Mandate==
The corporation was established as a state-owned company with the statutory backing of [[PNDC]] Laws 64 and 84. The laws mandated the corporation to engage in exploration, production and disposal of petroleum products.  The laws also established the legal structure that informed the corporation in contractual agreements between the Government of Ghana and private [[oil exploration]] companies. In 1987, the Petroleum [[Income Tax]] Law were added to the corporation's mandate to permit it to tax various petroleum products for consumption. The law was the PNDC Law 188.

==Functions==
The corporation has amongst it functions to promote petroleum exploration activities, to appraise existing petroleum discoveries, to ensure that Ghana benefit the most from the development of the country's petroleum resources. The corporation promotes the training of Ghanaians in petroleum related activities and ensure [[environmental protection]] in all petroleum related activities.

{{nihongo|'''Hama Wing'''|ハマウィング|Hama wingu}} is the nickname for the {{nihongo|'''Yokohama City Wind Power Plant'''|横浜市風力発電所|Yokohama-shi Fūryoku hatsudensho}}, an experimental [[wind power]] plant established in [[Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]] in April 2007.

The wind turbine is a [[Vestas|Vestas Wind Systems A/S]] Model V80-2.0MW with a rotor diameter of {{Convert|80|m|ft}} and a {{Convert|78|m|ft}} tall tower. At the highest point of rotation the turbine is {{Convert|118|m|ft}} tall, higher than the {{Convert|112.5|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Cosmo Clock 21]] [[Ferris wheel]] in Yokohama. The turbine has an output of 1,980&amp;nbsp;kW (enough power for 860 homes), and its purpose is to publicize environmentally friendly alternative energy sources while providing electricity to the [[Minato Mirai 21]] district.

{{Infobox helium}}
'''Helium''' (from {{lang-el|ἥλιος|[[Helios]]|lit=Sun}}) is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''He''' and [[atomic number]] 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, [[Inert gas|inert]], [[monatomic]] [[gas]], the first in the [[noble gas]] group in the [[periodic table]]. Its [[boiling point]] is the lowest among all the [[Chemical element|elements]].&lt;!--He does not have a melting point at standard pressure that can be compared with the others sensibly--&gt; After [[hydrogen]], helium is the second lightest and second most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant element]] in the observable [[universe]], being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the [[Sun]] and in [[Jupiter]]. This is due to the very high [[nuclear binding energy]] (per [[nucleon]]) of [[helium-4]] with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both [[nuclear fusion]] and [[radioactive decay]]. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the [[Big Bang]]. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in [[stars]].

Helium is named for the Greek [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] of the Sun, [[Helios]]. It was first detected as an unknown yellow [[spectroscopy|spectral line]] signature in sunlight during a [[Solar eclipse of August 18, 1868|solar eclipse in 1868]] by [[Georges Rayet]],&lt;ref&gt;Rayet, G. (1868) [https://web.archive.org/web/20180817142616/https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d000083928;view=1up;seq=763 "Analyse spectral des protubérances observées, pendant l'éclipse totale de Soleil visible le 18 août 1868, à la presqu'île de Malacca"] (Spectral analysis of the protuberances observed during the total solar eclipse, seen on 18 August 1868, from the Malacca peninsula), ''Comptes rendus'' ... , '''67''' :  757–759.

( ... I saw immediately a series of nine bright lines that ... seemed to me should be classed as the principal lines of the solar spectrum, B, D, E, b, an unknown line, F, and two lines of the group G.)&lt;/ref&gt; Captain C. T. Haig,&lt;ref&gt;Captain C. T. Haig (1868) [https://books.google.com/books?id=glFJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage "Account of spectroscopic observations of the eclipse of the sun, August 18th, 1868,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''17''' :  74–80.  From p. 74:  "I may state at once that I observed the spectra of two red flames close to each other, and in their spectra two broad bright bands quite sharply defined, one rose-madder and the other light golden."&lt;/ref&gt; [[N. R. Pogson|Norman R. Pogson]],&lt;ref&gt;Pogson filed his observations of the 1868 eclipse with the local Indian government,
 but his report wasn't published.  (Biman B. Nath, ''The Story of Helium and the Birth of Astrophysics'' (New York, New York:  Springer, 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zko_Na5IQL8C&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 8.]) Nevertheless, Lockyer quoted from his report.

Prologue," ''Nature'', '''53''' :  319–322 :  "Pogson, in referring to the eclipse of 1868, said that the yellow line was "at D, or near D." "&lt;/ref&gt; and Lieutenant John Herschel,&lt;ref&gt;Lieutenant John Herschel (1868) [https://books.google.com/books?id=glFJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Account of the solar eclipse of 1868, as seen at Jamkandi in the Bombay Presidency,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''17''' :  104–120.  From p. 113:  As the moment of the total solar eclipse approached, " … I recorded an increasing brilliancy in the spectrum in the neighborhood of D, so great in fact as to prevent any measurement of that line till an opportune cloud moderated the light.  I am not prepared to offer any explanation of this."  From p. 117:  "I also consider that there can be no question that the ORANGE LINE was identical with D, so far as the capacity of the instrument to establish any such identity is concerned."&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen|Jules Janssen]].&lt;ref&gt;In his initial report to the French Academy of Sciences about the 1868 eclipse, Janssen made no mention of a yellow line in the solar spectrum.  See:
*  Janssen (1868) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hpZDAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA838#v=onepage "Indication de quelques-uns des résultats obtenus à Cocanada, pendant l'éclipse du mois d'août dernier, et à la suite de cette éclipse"] (Information on some of the results obtained at Cocanada, during the eclipse of the month of last August, and following that eclipse), ''Comptes rendus'' ... , '''67''' :  838–839.

However, subsequently, in an unpublished letter of 19 December 1868 to Charles Sainte-Claire Deville, Janssen asked Deville to inform the French Academy of Sciences that :  "Several observers have claimed the bright D line as forming part of the spectrum of the prominences on 18 August.  The bright yellow line did indeed lie very close to D, but the light was more refrangible [i.e., of shorter wavelength] than those of the D lines.  My subsequent studies of the Sun have shown the accuracy of what I state here."  (See:  (Launay, 2012), p. 45.)&lt;/ref&gt; Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element along with [[Norman Lockyer]]. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868 while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element, which he named. The formal [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of the element]] was made in 1895 by two [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemists, [[Per Teodor Cleve]] and [[Nils Abraham Langlet]], who found helium emanating from the [[uranium]] [[ore]] [[cleveite]]. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in [[natural gas field]]s in parts of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas today.

Liquid helium is used in [[Helium cryogenics|cryogenics]] (its largest single use, absorbing about a quarter of production), particularly in the cooling of [[superconducting magnet]]s, with the main commercial application being in [[MRI]] scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for [[arc welding]] and in processes such as growing crystals to make [[silicon wafer]]s—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a [[lifting gas]] in [[balloon]]s and [[airship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=35225 |title=Helium: Up, Up and Away? |first=Melinda |last=Rose |website=Photonics Spectra |date=October 2008 |access-date=February 27, 2010}} For a more authoritative but older 1996 pie chart showing U.S. helium use by sector, showing much the same result, see the chart reproduced in "Applications" section of this article.&lt;/ref&gt; As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the [[human voice]]. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (helium&amp;nbsp;I and helium&amp;nbsp;II) is important to researchers studying [[quantum mechanics]] (in particular the property of [[superfluidity]]) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as [[superconductivity]], produced in [[matter]] near [[absolute zero]].

On Earth it is relatively rare—5.2 [[parts per million|ppm]] by volume in the [[atmosphere]]. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural [[radioactive decay]] of heavy radioactive elements ([[thorium]] and [[uranium]], although there are other examples), as the [[alpha particle]]s emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. This [[radiogenic]] helium is trapped with [[natural gas]] in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called [[fractional distillation]]. Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because once released into the atmosphere it readily [[Atmospheric escape|escapes into space]]—was thought to be in increasingly short supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connor |first=Steve |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/why-the-world-is-running-out-of-helium-2059357.html |title=Why the world is running out of helium|work=The Independent |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=2013-09-16 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Ethan Siegel|first=Ethan|last=Siegel |url=http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/12/12/why-the-world-will-run-out-of-helium/ |title=Why the World Will Run Out of Helium|website=Starts with a Bang |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date=12 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witchalls, Clint (18 August 2010) [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727735.700-nobel-prizewinner-we-are-running-out-of-helium.html Nobel prizewinner: We are running out of helium].

==History==

===Scientific discoveries===
The first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as a bright yellow line with a [[wavelength]] of 587.49 nanometers in the [[Emission spectrum|spectrum]] of the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]]. The line was detected by French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen|Jules Janssen]] during [[Solar eclipse of August 18, 1868|a total solar eclipse]] in [[Guntur]], India.&lt;ref name="frnch"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = French astronomers in India during the 17th&amp;nbsp;– 19th centuries |journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume =101|issue = 2|pages = 95–100|bibcode = 1991JBAA..101...95K|author = Kochhar, R. K.|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; This line was initially assumed to be [[sodium]]. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer [[Norman Lockyer]] observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; because it was near the known D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Fraunhofer line]] lines of sodium.&lt;ref name="Lockyer 1868"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lockyer |first1=J.

[[File:Helium spectrum.jpg|left|thumb|Spectral lines of helium|alt=Picture of visible spectrum with superimposed sharp yellow and blue and violet lines.]]
In 1881, Italian physicist [[Luigi Palmieri]] detected helium on Earth for the first time through its D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; spectral line, when he analyzed a material that had been [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimated]] during a recent eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].&lt;ref name="Palmieri 1881"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmieri |first1=Luigi |title=La riga dell'Helium apparsa in una recente sublimazione vesuviana |trans-title=The line of helium appeared in a recently sublimated material [from Mt.] Vesuvius. |journal=Rendiconto Dell'Accademia delle Scienze Fisiche e Matematiche (Naples, Italy) |volume=20 |date=1881 |page=223 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnl7mr;view=1up;seq=251 |accessdate=1 May 2017 |quote=''Raccolsi alcun tempo fa una sostanza amorfa di consistenza butirracea e di colore giallo sbiadato sublimata sull'orlo di una fumarola prossima alla bocca di eruzione.

In 1907, [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Thomas Royds]] demonstrated that [[alpha particle]]s are helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectrum of the new gas inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14786440808636511| title = XXIV.Spectrum of the radium emanation| journal = Philosophical Magazine| series = series 6| volume = 16| issue = 92| pages = 313–317| year = 1908| last1 = Rutherford| first1 = E.| last2 = Royds| first2 = T.| url = https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951000614205r;view=1up;seq=349}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] by cooling the gas to less than one [[kelvin]].&lt;ref&gt;Onnes, H.

===Extraction and use===
[[File:Kansas Helium Marker.jpg|thumb|Historical marker, denoting a massive helium find near [[Dexter, Kansas]]]]
After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in [[Dexter, Kansas]], produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist [[Erasmus Haworth]] collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the [[University of Kansas]] at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists [[Hamilton Cady]] and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% [[methane]] (a [[combustible]] percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% [[hydrogen]], and 12% an unidentifiable gas.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = McFarland, D.

This enabled the United States to become the world's leading supplier of helium. Following a suggestion by Sir [[Richard Threlfall]], the [[United States Navy]] sponsored three small experimental helium plants during World War I. The goal was to supply [[barrage balloon]]s with the non-flammable, lighter-than-air gas. A total of {{convert|5700|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} of 92% helium was produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had previously been obtained.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; Some of this gas was used in the world's first helium-filled airship, the U.S. Navy's C-7, which flew its maiden voyage from [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], to [[Bolling Field]] in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Emme, Eugene M. comp.|title=Aeronautics and Astronautics: An American Chronology of Science and Technology in the Exploration of Space, 1915–1960 |date=1961 |pages=11–19 |chapter=Aeronautics and Astronautics Chronology, 1920–1924 |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Timeline/1920-24.html |publisher=[[NASA]] |location=Washington, D.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly two years before the Navy's first ''rigid'' helium-filled airship, the [[Naval Aircraft Factory]]-built [[USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)|''USS Shenandoah'']], flew in September 1923.

Although the extraction process, using low-temperature [[gas liquefaction]], was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a [[lifting gas]] in lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc [[welding]]. The [[helium mass spectrometer]] was also vital in the atomic bomb [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Leak Detection|last=Hilleret|first=N.|publisher=[[CERN]]|title=CERN Accelerator School, vacuum technology: proceedings: Scanticon Conference Centre, Snekersten, Denmark, 28 May&amp;nbsp;– 3 June 1999 |editor=S.

The [[government of the United States]] set up the [[National Helium Reserve]] in 1925 at [[Amarillo, Texas]], with the goal of supplying military [[airship]]s in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; Because of the [[Helium Act of 1925]], which banned the export of scarce helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]], like all German [[Zeppelin]]s, was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas. The helium market after World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of [[liquid helium]] as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen [[rocket fuel]] (among other uses) during the [[Space Race]] and [[Cold War]]. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/3627447| author = Williamson, John G.| title = Energy for Kansas| journal = Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science| volume = 71| issue = 4| pages = 432–438|date =1968| jstor = 3627447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the "Helium Acts Amendments of 1960" (Public Law 86–777), the [[United States Bureau of Mines|U.S. Bureau of Mines]] arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas. For this ''helium conservation'' program, the Bureau built a {{convert|425|mi|km|adj=on}} pipeline from [[Bushton, Kansas]], to connect those plants with the government's partially depleted Cliffside gas field near Amarillo, Texas. This helium-nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the Cliffside gas field until needed, at which time it was further purified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Federal Register|date = 2005-10-06|volume = 70|issue = 193|page = 58464|url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/pdf/05-20084.pdf|format=PDF| title = Conservation Helium Sale|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1995, a billion cubic meters of the gas had been collected and the reserve was US$1.4&amp;nbsp;billion in debt, prompting the [[Congress of the United States]] in 1996 to phase out the reserve.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stwertka"&gt;Stwertka, Albert (1998).

Helium produced between 1930 and 1945 was about 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen), which was adequate for airships. In 1945, a small amount of 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Bureau of Mines / Minerals yearbook 1949|date=1951|last1=Mullins|first1=P.

For many years, the United States produced more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in [[Arzew]], Algeria, producing 17 million cubic meters (600 million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/ds/2005/140/helium-use.pdf|format=PDF| title= Helium End User Statistic|accessdate=2008-07-20|publisher = U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004–2006, additional plants in [[Ras Laffan Industrial City|Ras Laffan]], [[Qatar]], and [[Skikda]], Algeria were built.

===The helium atom===
{{Main|Helium atom}}
[[File:Helium atom QM.svg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a diffuse gray sphere with grayscale density decreasing from the center. Length scale about 1 Angstrom. An inset outlines the structure of the core, with two red and two blue atoms at the length scale of 1 femtometer.|'''The helium atom.''' Depicted are the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (pink) and the [[electron cloud]] distribution (black). The nucleus (upper right) in helium-4 is in reality spherically symmetric and closely resembles the electron cloud, although for more complicated nuclei this is not always the case.]]

====Helium in quantum mechanics====
In the perspective of [[quantum mechanics]], helium is the second simplest [[atom]] to model, following the [[hydrogen atom]]. Helium is composed of two electrons in [[atomic orbital]]s surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and (usually) two neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach (see [[3-body problem]]) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such [[computational chemistry]] methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within &lt; 2% of the correct value, in a few computational steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/helium.htm|last=Watkins|first=Thayer|publisher=San Jose State University|title=The Old Quantum Physics of Niels Bohr and the Spectrum of Helium: A Modified Version of the Bohr Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such models show that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge ''Z'' which each electron sees, is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic "bare" helium nucleus.

====The related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell====
The nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an [[alpha particle]]. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own [[electron cloud]]. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these [[fermion]]s fully occupy [[1s1s|1s]] orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.

For example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.

In a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion. Some stable helium-3 (2 protons and 1 neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is a very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4.

[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|right|Binding energy per nucleon of common isotopes. The binding energy per particle of helium-4 is significantly larger than all nearby nuclides.]]
The unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important [[Cosmology|cosmologically]]: it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the [[Big Bang]], as the "soup" of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. So tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see [[nucleogenesis]] and [[binding energy]]) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5. It was barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per [[nucleon]], carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see [[triple alpha process]]). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.

All heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.

Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its [[thermal conductivity]], [[specific heat]], and [[Speed of sound|sound speed]] in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except [[hydrogen]].

Most extraterrestrial helium is found in a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state, with properties quite different from those of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the [[solar wind]] together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], giving rise to [[Birkeland current]]s and the [[aurora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Helium isotopes in an aurora|last1 = Buhler|first1=F.|last2 = Axford|first2=W.

{{Main|Liquid helium}}

Unlike any other element, helium will remain liquid down to [[absolute zero]] at normal pressures. This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the [[zero point energy]] of the system is too high to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5&amp;nbsp;K (about −272&amp;nbsp;°C or −457&amp;nbsp;°F) at about 25 bar (2.5&amp;nbsp;MPa) of pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 2005-10-05 |url = http://www.phys.ualberta.ca/~therman/lowtemp/projects1.htm |title = Solid Helium |publisher = Department of Physics [[University of Alberta]]|accessdate=2008-07-20| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531145546/http://www.phys.ualberta.ca/~therman/lowtemp/projects1.htm| archivedate = May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the [[refractive index]] of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp [[melting point]] and has a [[crystal]]line structure, but it is highly [[Compressibility|compressible]]; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%.&lt;ref name="LANL.gov"&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[bulk modulus]] of about 27 [[megapascal|MPa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Grilly, E.

====Helium I====
Below its [[boiling point]] of 4.22 kelvins and above the [[lambda point]] of 2.1768 kelvins, the [[isotope]] helium-4 exists in a normal colorless liquid state, called ''helium&amp;nbsp;I''.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; Like other [[cryogenic]] liquids, helium&amp;nbsp;I boils when it is heated and contracts when its temperature is lowered. Below the lambda point, however, helium does not boil, and it expands as the temperature is lowered further. &lt;!-- clarifyme / The rate of expansion decreases below the lambda point until about 1&amp;nbsp;K is reached; at which point expansion completely stops and helium&amp;nbsp;I starts to contract again. / if it is below the lambda point, should not it be helium II?--&gt;

Helium&amp;nbsp;I has a gas-like [[index of refraction]] of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of [[Expanded polystyrene|Styrofoam]] are often used to show where the surface is.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; This colorless liquid has a very low [[viscosity]] and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K),&lt;ref name=crc6120&gt;{{RubberBible86th|page=6-120}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is only one-fourth the value expected from [[classical physics]].&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called ''quantum fluids'', meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion ([[thermal energy]]) from masking the atomic properties.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

====Helium II====
{{main|Superfluid helium-4}}
Liquid helium below its lambda point (called ''helium&amp;nbsp;II'') exhibits very unusual characteristics. Due to its high [[thermal conductivity]], when it boils, it does not bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. [[Helium-3]] also has a [[superfluid]] phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less is known about the properties of the isotope.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;
[[File:helium-II-creep.svg|thumb|upright|Unlike ordinary liquids, helium&amp;nbsp;II will creep along surfaces in order to reach an equal level; after a short while, the levels in the two containers will equalize. The [[Rollin film]] also covers the interior of the larger container; if it were not sealed, the helium&amp;nbsp;II would creep out and escape.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;|alt=A cross-sectional drawing showing one vessel inside another. There is a liquid in the outer vessel, and it tends to flow into the inner vessel over its walls.]]

Helium&amp;nbsp;II is a superfluid, a quantum mechanical state (see: [[macroscopic quantum phenomena]]) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries as thin as 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m it has no measurable [[viscosity]].&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the ''two-fluid model'' for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a [[ground state]], which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1006/aphy.2000.6019 |title = Microscopic Theory of Superfluid Helium |journal = Annals of Physics |volume = 281 |issue = 1–2 |date = 2000|pages = 636–705 12091211 |author = Hohenberg, P. C. |author2 = Martin, P. C.|bibcode = 2000AnPhy.281..636H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''fountain effect'', a chamber is constructed which is connected to a reservoir of helium&amp;nbsp;II by a [[sintering|sintered]] disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If the interior of the container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Brent|url=http://cryowwwebber.gsfc.nasa.gov/introduction/liquid_helium.html |title=Introduction to Liquid Helium |publisher=NASA|accessdate=2007-01-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901062951/http://cryowwwebber.gsfc.nasa.gov/introduction/liquid_helium.html |archivedate=2005-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thermal conductivity of helium&amp;nbsp;II is greater than that of any other known substance, a million times that of helium&amp;nbsp;I and several hundred times that of [[copper]].&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a [[valence band]] of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. Helium&amp;nbsp;II has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The [[heat transfer|flow of heat]] is governed by equations that are similar to the [[wave equation]] used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8&amp;nbsp;K through helium&amp;nbsp;II as waves in a phenomenon known as ''[[second sound]]''.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

Helium&amp;nbsp;II also exhibits a creeping effect. When a surface extends past the level of helium&amp;nbsp;II, the helium&amp;nbsp;II moves along the surface, against the force of [[gravity]]. Helium&amp;nbsp;II will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a [[Rollin film]] and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, [[Bernard V. Rollin]].&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.76.1209 |title = Rollin Film Rates in Liquid Helium |journal = Physical Review |volume = 76 |issue = 8 |pages = 1209–1211|date = 1949 |author = Fairbank, H.

The most common isotope, helium-4, is produced on Earth by [[alpha decay]] of heavier radioactive elements; the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium-4 nuclei.

===Modern extraction and distribution===
For large-scale use, helium is extracted by [[fractional distillation]] from natural gas, which can contain as much as 7% helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Winter, Mark| title = Helium: the essentials| publisher = University of Sheffield|date = 2008| url = http://www.webelements.com/helium/| accessdate = 2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since helium has a lower [[boiling point]] than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly [[nitrogen]] and [[methane]]). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which almost all of the remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. [[Activated charcoal]] is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is [[neon]]. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a [[cryogenic]] process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.&lt;ref name="wwsupply" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| author = Cai, Z. | display-authors = etal|title = Modelling Helium Markets| publisher = University of Cambridge| date = 2007| url = http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/phd/downloads/conference_spring2007/papers/cai.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-07-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326072513/http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/phd/downloads/conference_spring2007/papers/cai.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helium must be extracted from natural gas because it is present in air at only a fraction of that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Impact of Selling, see [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9860&amp;page=40 page 40] for the estimate of total theoretical helium production by neon and liquid air plants&lt;/ref&gt; Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of [[lithium]] or [[boron]] with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with [[deuteron]]s, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Photographic Investigation of the Transmutation of Lithium and Boron by Protons and of Lithium by Ions of the Heavy Isotope of Hydrogen |author = Dee, P.

Helium is commercially available in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, it can be supplied in small insulated containers called [[Dewar flask|dewars]] which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (around 11,000 U.S. [[gallon]]s). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities of as much as 4,860&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).

===Conservation advocates===
According to helium conservationists like Nobel laureate physicist [[Robert Coleman Richardson]], writing in 2010, the free market price of helium has contributed to "wasteful" usage (e.g. for [[Tethered helium balloon|helium balloons]]). Prices in the 2000s had been lowered by the decision of the U.S. Congress to sell off the country's large helium stockpile by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/why-the-world-is-running-out-of-helium-2059357.html |title=Richard Coleman campaigning against US Congress' decision to sell all helium supplies by 2015 |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-27 |location=London |first=Steve |last=Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richardson, the price needed to be multiplied by 20 to eliminate the excessive wasting of helium. In their book, the ''Future of helium as a natural resource'' (Routledge, 2012), Nuttall, Clarke &amp; Glowacki (2012) also proposed to create an International Helium Agency (IHA) to build a sustainable market for this precious commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

While balloons are perhaps the best known use of helium, they are a minor part of all helium use.&lt;ref name="stwertka"/&gt; Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low [[boiling point]], low [[density]], low [[solubility]], high [[thermal conductivity]], or [[Chemically inert|inertness]]. Of the 2014 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (180 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 32% of the total in 2014) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical [[MRI]] scanners and [[NMR]] spectrometers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2010/jan/27/helium-sell-off-risks-future-supply Helium sell-off risks future supply], Michael Banks, ''Physics World'', 27 January 2010. accessed February 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major uses were pressurizing and purging systems, welding, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, and leak detection. Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.&lt;ref name="usgs-helium"/&gt;

=== Controlled atmospheres ===
Helium is used as a protective gas in growing [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] crystals, in [[titanium]] and [[zirconium]] production, and in [[gas chromatography]],&lt;ref name="LANL.gov"/&gt; because it is inert. Because of its inertness, [[ideal gas|thermally and calorically perfect]] nature, high [[speed of sound]], and high value of the [[heat capacity ratio]], it is also useful in [[supersonic wind tunnel]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Beckwith|first1=I.

=== Gas tungsten arc welding ===
{{main|Gas tungsten arc welding}}
Helium is used as a [[shielding gas]] in [[arc welding]] processes on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or nitrogen.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt; A number of inert shielding gases are used in gas tungsten arc welding, but helium is used instead of cheaper [[argon]] especially for welding materials that have higher [[heat conductivity]], like [[aluminium]] or [[copper]].

=== Minor uses ===

==== Industrial leak detection ====
[[File:Ac-system 2.jpg|thumb|left|A dual chamber helium leak detection machine|alt=Photo of a large, metal-framed device (about 3×1×1.5 m) standing in a room.]]

One industrial application for helium is [[leak detection]]. Because helium [[diffusion|diffuses]] through solids three times faster than air, it is used as a tracer gas to detect [[leak]]s in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers.&lt;ref name="nostrand"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Helium|editor = Considine, Glenn D.| encyclopedia = Van Nostrand's Encyclopedia of Chemistry| pages = 764–765|publisher = Wiley-Interscience|date = 2005|isbn = 978-0-471-61525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device ([[helium mass spectrometer]]), even at the leak rates as small as 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; mbar·L/s (10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5L8uIAFm4SoC&amp;pg=PA493|page=493|title=High-vacuum technology: a practical guide|author=Hablanian, M. H.|publisher=CRC Press|date=1997|isbn=978-0-8247-9834-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants (thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, ceramics, and synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ekin, Jack W.|title=Experimental Techniques for Low-Temperature measurements|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q9tmZQTDPiYC|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|isbn=978-0-19-857054-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flight ====
[[File:Goodyear-blimp.jpg|thumb|left|Because of its low density and incombustibility, helium is the gas of choice to fill airships such as the [[Goodyear blimp]].|alt=The Good Year Blimp]]
Because it is [[lighter than air]], [[airship]]s and balloons are inflated with helium for [[Lifting gas|lift]]. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane at a lower rate, helium has the advantage of being non-flammable, and indeed [[fire-retardant]]. Another minor use is in [[rocket]]ry, where helium is used as an [[ullage]] medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make [[rocket fuel]]. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in [[space vehicle]]s. For example, the [[Saturn V]] rocket used in the [[Apollo program]] needed about 370,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.&lt;ref name="LANL.gov"/&gt;

==== Minor commercial and recreational uses ====
Helium as a breathing gas has no [[Nitrogen narcosis|narcotic properties]], so helium mixtures such as [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]], [[heliox]] and [[Trimix (breathing gas)#Heliair|heliair]] are used for [[deep diving]] to reduce the effects of narcosis, which worsen with increasing depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fowler |first=B. |last2=Ackles |first2=K.

This reduces the [[Reynolds number]] of flow, leading to a reduction of [[turbulent flow]] and an increase in [[laminar flow]], which requires less work of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Butcher, Scott J.| author2 = Jones, Richard L.| author3 = Mayne, Jonathan R.| author4 = Hartley, Timothy C.| author5 = Petersen, Stewart R.| title = Impaired exercise ventilatory mechanics with the self-contained breathing apparatus are improved with heliox| journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology| volume = 101| issue = 6|date = 2007| doi = 10.1007/s00421-007-0541-5| pmid = 17701048| pages = 659–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BOCheox21"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bochealthcare.co.uk/en/products/heliox/index.shtml |title=Heliox21 |publisher=Linde Gas Therapeutics |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At depths below {{convert|150|m|ft}} divers breathing helium–oxygen mixtures begin to experience tremors and a decrease in psychomotor function, symptoms of [[high-pressure nervous syndrome]].&lt;ref name=HungerBennett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunger |first=W.

[[Helium–neon laser]]s, a type of low-powered gas laser producing a red beam, had various practical applications which included [[barcode reader]]s and [[laser pointer]]s, before they were almost universally replaced by cheaper [[diode laser]]s.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt;

For its inertness and high [[thermal conductivity]], neutron transparency, and because it does not form radioactive isotopes under reactor conditions, helium is used as a heat-transfer medium in some gas-cooled [[nuclear reactors]].&lt;ref name="nostrand"/&gt;

Helium, mixed with a heavier gas such as xenon, is useful for [[thermoacoustic refrigeration]] due to the resulting high [[heat capacity ratio]] and low [[Prandtl number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Working gases in thermoacoustic engines |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |date=1999 |volume=105 |issue=5 |pages=2677–2684 |doi=10.1121/1.426884|author1 = Belcher, James R.|pmid=10335618|bibcode = 1999ASAJ..105.2677B|author2=Slaton, William V.|author3=Raspet, Richard|author4=Bass, Henry E.|author5=Lightfoot, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inertness of helium has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mending the Ozone Hole: Science, Technology, and Policy |author=Makhijani, Arjun |author2=Gurney, Kevin |publisher=MIT Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-262-13308-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helium is also used in some [[hard disk drive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/hgst-balloons-disk-capacity-with-helium-filled-6tb-drive/ HGST balloons disk capacity with helium-filled 6TB drive | Ars Technica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scientific uses ====
The use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations in the space between [[lens (optics)|lenses]] in some [[telescope]]s, due to its extremely low [[index of refraction]].&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; This method is especially used in solar telescopes where a vacuum tight telescope tube would be too heavy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Jakobsson, H. |title = Simulations of the dynamics of the Large Earth-based Solar Telescope |journal = Astronomical &amp; Astrophysical Transactions |volume = 13 |issue = 1 |pages = 35–46 |date= 1997 |doi = 10.1080/10556799708208113|bibcode = 1997A&amp;AT...13...35J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode = 1983ApOpt..22...10E|title = Tests of vacuum VS. helium in a solar telescope|author = Engvold, O.|author2 = Dunn, R.B.|author3 = Smartt, R.

Helium is a commonly used carrier gas for [[gas chromatography]].

The age of rocks and minerals that contain [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] can be estimated by measuring the level of helium with a process known as [[helium dating]].&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

Helium at low temperatures is used in [[cryogenics]], and in certain cryogenics applications. As examples of applications, liquid helium is used to cool certain metals to the extremely low temperatures required for [[superconductivity]], such as in [[superconducting magnet]]s for [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. The [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] uses 96 [[metric ton]]s of liquid helium to maintain the temperature at 1.9 kelvin.&lt;ref name="CERN-LHC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visits.web.cern.ch/visits/guides/tools/presentation/LHC_booklet-2.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706223231/http://visits.web.cern.ch/visits/guides/tools/presentation/LHC_booklet-2.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |title=LHC: Facts and Figures|publisher=[[CERN]]|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a contaminant==
While chemically inert, helium contamination will impair the operation of [[microelectromechanical systems]] such that iPhones may fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Oberhaus |first1=Daniel |title=Why a Helium Leak Disabled Every iPhone in a Medical Facility |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gye4aw/why-a-helium-leak-disabled-every-iphone-in-a-medical-facility |accessdate=31 October 2018 |work=Motherboard |publisher=[[Vice Media]] |date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inhalation and safety==

===Effects===
Neutral helium at standard conditions is non-toxic, plays no biological role and is found in trace amounts in human blood.

{{Listen|right|filename=Helium article read with helium.ogg|title=Effect of helium on a human voice|description=The effect of helium on a human voice|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The [[speed of sound]] in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in air. Because the [[fundamental frequency]] of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to the speed of sound in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]] of the [[vocal tract]].&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ackerman|first1=M.

The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as [[sulfur hexafluoride]] or [[xenon]].

===Hazards===
Inhaling helium can be dangerous if done to excess, since helium is a simple [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]] and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grass"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Suicidal asphyxiation with helium: Report of three cases Suizid mit Helium Gas: Bericht über drei Fälle|journal = Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift| volume = 119|issue =9–10|date = 2007|doi = 10.1007/s00508-007-0785-4|author = Grassberger, Martin|author2 = Krauskopf, Astrid |pages = 323–325 |language=German, English|pmid = 17571238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in 2006.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| title =2 found dead under deflated balloon| url = http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/03/Tampabay/2_found_dead_under_de.shtml | author = Montgomery B. | author2 = Hayes S.| date= 2006-06-03| publisher = Tampa Bay Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/two-students-die-after-breathing-helium-1.623684| title =Two students die after breathing helium | publisher = CBC | date=4 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, an Australian girl (her age is not known) from Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily [[cyanosis|turned blue]] after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon.&lt;ref name="balloonartists.com.au"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://balloonartists.com.au/helium-dangers.html | title =Helium inhalation – it's no laughing matter – Article courtesy of BOC Gases | publisher =Balloon Artists &amp; Suppliers Association of Australasia Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lousballoons.com.au"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lousballoons.com.au/dangers-of-helium.html | title = Dangers of Helium Inhalation | publisher = Lou's Balloons | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104032013/http://www.lousballoons.com.au/dangers-of-helium.html | archivedate = 2014-01-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bouncetime.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bouncetime.co.uk/others_files/helium-gas-safety.htm | title =Helium Gas Safety &amp; Data Sheet | publisher = bouncetime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith]], "apparently" committed suicide in May at a hotel room in Rochester, Minnesota and that his death was recorded as "asphyxiation due to displacement of oxygen in confined space with helium".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-peter-smith-clinton-emails-dead-by-suicide/ Report: GOP operative who looked for Clinton emails committed suicide]'', CBS News, July 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; More details followed in the [[Chicago Tribune]].&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Skiba, David Heinzmann, Todd Lighty, ''[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-peter-smith-death-met-0713-20170713-story.html Peter W.

The safety issues for cryogenic helium are similar to those of [[liquid nitrogen]]; its extremely low temperatures can result in [[frostbite|cold burns]], and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant [[thermal expansion]] that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed to [[room temperature]].&lt;ref name="LANL.gov"/&gt;

At high pressures (more than about 20&amp;nbsp;atm or two&amp;nbsp;[[MPa]]), a mixture of helium and oxygen ([[heliox]]) can lead to [[high-pressure nervous syndrome]], a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding a small amount of nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Campbell| first = Ernest S.| title = High Pressure Nervous Syndrome| work = Physics and Problems With Gases|date = 2008-05-13| url = http://www.scuba-doc.com/HPNS.html| accessdate = 2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rostain J.C.|author2=Lemaire C.|author3=Gardette-Chauffour M.C.|author4=Doucet J.|author5=Naquet R.|title=Estimation of human susceptibility to the high-pressure nervous syndrome |journal=J Appl Physiol |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=1063–70 |date=1983|pmid=6853282|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/54/4/1063.abstract|accessdate=2008-08-09|doi=10.1152/jappl.1983.54.4.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HungerBennett/&gt;

'''Hipora''' is a waterproof and breathable fabric, used as insert in winter, motorcycle and cycling gloves. It is developed by the [[Korea]]n company [[Kolon Industries]].

==Design==
Hipora consists of a three-layer microporous silicon coating structure. Some types are impregnated with microscopic aluminum flakes to enhance heat retention characteristics.

The first layer prevents water from passing through. The pores are less than .5&amp;nbsp;um in diameter.

The second layer is a honeycomb structure that lets moisture in to let it expel through the first layer.

The third layer is very dense for added protection against water. This is the layer closest to the skin.

This technology meets [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29CFR 1910.1030).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1317">The '''Jhai Foundation''' is a non-profit organisation working mainly in [[Laos]].

One of its projects is bringing communication services to rural communities lacking electricity or telephones. To achieve this goal, they have developed the ''Jhai PC and Communication System'', a [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]], low energy consuming computer that can be powered by a [[foot-crank]] generator built into a bicycle frame or solar energy and uses a wireless network to provide [[VoIP]] and [[Internet]] services.

The [[JhaiPC]] runs [[Linux]] with a [[Internationalization and localization|localised]] version of [[KDE]]. The hardware and software design and user documentation for the JhaiPC are completely open and have been released through [[SourceForge.net]].

With the minimal communication technology provided by the JhaiPC small businesses, such as farmers in [[Ban Phon Kam]], are able to get better prices for their products. Jhai is also introducing [[organic farming]] techniques, [[fair trade]] marketing and direct sales to these farmers.

'''Magnetorheological elastomers''' (MREs) (also called magnetosensitive elastomers) are a class of solids that consist of [[polymer]]ic [[Matrix (chemical analysis)|matrix]] with embedded micro- or nano-sized [[ferromagnetic]] particles such as [[carbonyl iron]]. As a result of this composite microstructure, the mechanical properties of these materials can be controlled by the application of magnetic field.

==Fabrication==
MREs are typically prepared by curing process for polymers. The polymeric material (e.g. silicone rubber) in its liquid state is mixed with iron powder and several other additives to enhance their mechanical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, M. R., Carlson, J. D. &amp; Muñoz, B. C. A model of the behaviour of magnetorheological materials. Smart Mater. Struct. 5, 607–614 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The entire mixture is then cured at high temperature. Curing in the presence of a magnetic field causes the iron particles to arrange in chain like structures resulting in an anisotropic material. If magnetic field is not applied, then iron-particles are randomly distributed in the solid resulting in an isotropic material. Recently, an advanced technology, [[3D printing]] has also been used to configure the magnetic particles inside the polymer matrix. &lt;ref&gt;A.K. Bastola, V.T Hoang, L. Lin. A novel hybrid magnetorheological elastomer developed by 3D printing. Materials and Design 114, 391–397 (2017) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2016.11.006 [link&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
MREs can be classified according to several parameters like: particles type, matrix, structure and distribution of particles:&lt;ref&gt;Anna Boczkowska and Stefan Awietjan (2012).

==Theoretical Studies==
In order to understand magneto-mechanical behaviour of MREs, theoretical studies need to be performed which couple the theories of [[electromagnetism]] with [[mechanics]]. Such theories are called theories of magneto-mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Kankanala, S. V. &amp; Triantafyllidis, N. On finitely strained magnetorheological elastomers. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 52, 2869–2908 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorfmann, A. &amp; Ogden, R. W. Magnetoelastic modelling of elastomers. Eur. J. Mech. - A/Solids 22, 497–507 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
MREs have been used for vibration isolation applications since their stiffness changes within a magnetic field &lt;ref&gt;Deng, H. X., Gong, X. L. &amp; Wang, L. H.

M. Milne-Thomson]].

Let &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Potential flow|complex potential]] for a fluid flow, where all [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] of &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; lie in &lt;math&gt;|z| &gt; a&lt;/math&gt;. If a circle &lt;math&gt;|z| = a&lt;/math&gt; is placed into that flow, the complex potential for the new flow is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Tulu|first=Serdar|title=Vortex dynamics in domains with boundaries|url=http://library.iyte.edu.tr/tezler/doktora/matematik/T000958.pdf|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;w = f(z) + \overline{f\left( \frac{a^2}{\bar{z}} \right)} = f(z) + \overline f\left( \frac{a^2}{z} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

with same singularities as &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;|z| &gt; a&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;|z| = a&lt;/math&gt; is a streamline. On the circle &lt;math&gt;|z| = a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z\bar z = a^2&lt;/math&gt;, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;w = f(z) + \overline{f(z)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
Consider a uniform irrotational flow &lt;math&gt;f(z) = Uz&lt;/math&gt; with velocity &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; flowing in the positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction and place an infinitely long cylinder of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the flow with the center of the cylinder at the origin. Then &lt;math&gt;f\left(\frac{a^2}{\bar z}\right) = \frac{Ua^2}{\bar z}, \ \Rightarrow \ \overline{f\left( \frac{a^2}{\bar{z}} \right)} = \frac{Ua^2}{ z}&lt;/math&gt;, hence using circle theorem,

:&lt;math&gt;w(z) = U \left(z + \frac{a^2}{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

represents the complex potential of uniform flow over a cylinder.

Explanation: Katherine and Petruchio are getting married. At the tailor shop, they examine the wedding dress, which is nearly finished. Petruchio is concerned that it has too many frills, wonders what it will cost, and suspects that he has been cheated. Katherine says she likes it, and complains that Petruchio is making a fool of her. The taylor repeats Katherine's words: Sir, she says you're making a fool of her. This is where Petruchio launches into the above-quoted tirade. ''Monstrous'' may be a double-entendre for cuckold. The half-yard, quarter and nail were divisions of the yard used in cloth measurement.&lt;ref name="ShurgotOwens1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael W. Shurgot|author2=Margaret E.

[[Image:Nano Si 640x480.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Silicon nanopowder]]

'''Nanocrystalline silicon''' ('''nc-Si'''), sometimes also known as '''microcrystalline silicon''' ('''μc-Si'''), is a form of [[porous silicon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semiconductor.net/index.asp?layout=siTechNews&amp;industryid=47307&amp;starting=341 Technical articles]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[allotropy|allotropic]] form of [[silicon]] with [[paracrystalline]] structure—is similar to [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si), in that it has an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] phase. Where they differ, however, is that nc-Si has small grains of crystalline silicon within the amorphous phase. This is in contrast to [[polycrystalline silicon]] (poly-Si) which consists solely of crystalline silicon grains, separated by grain boundaries. The difference comes solely from the grain size of the crystalline grains. Most materials with grains in the micrometre range are actually fine-grained polysilicon, so nanocrystalline silicon is a better term. The term Nanocrystalline silicon refers to a range of materials around the transition region from amorphous to microcrystalline phase in the silicon thin film. The crystalline volume fraction (as measured from [[Raman spectroscopy]]) is another criterion to describe the materials in this transition zone.

nc-Si has many useful advantages over a-Si, one being that if grown properly it can have a higher [[electron mobility]], due to the presence of the silicon [[crystallite]]s. It also shows increased absorption in the red and [[infrared]] [[wavelength]]s, which make it an important material for use in a-Si [[solar cell]]s. One of the most important advantages of nanocrystalline silicon, however, is that it has increased stability over a-Si, one of the reasons being because of its lower [[hydrogen]] concentration. Although it currently cannot attain the mobility that poly-Si can, it has the advantage over poly-Si that it is easier to fabricate, as it can be deposited using conventional low temperature a-Si deposition techniques, such as [[Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition|PECVD]], as opposed to [[laser]] [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] or high temperature CVD processes, in the case of poly-Si.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Sushmita (2006). ''Understanding Of Nano Science And Technology''. Global Vision Publishing Ho.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The main application of this novel material is in the field of silicon [[thin film solar cell]]s. As nc-Si has about the same [[bandgap]] as [[crystalline silicon]], which is ~1.12 eV, it can be combined in thin layers with a-Si, creating a layered, multi-junction cell called a [[tandem cell]]. The top cell in a-Si absorbs the visible light and leaves the [[infrared]] part of the spectrum for the bottom cell in nanocrystalline Si.

A few companies are on the verge of commercializing silicon inks based on nanocrystalline silicon or on other silicon compounds. The [[semiconductor]] industry is also investigating the potential for nanocrystalline silicon, especially in the memory area.

==Thin-film silicon==
Nanocrystalline silicon and small-grained [[polycrystalline silicon]] are considered [[thin-film silicon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/tf_polycrystalline.html Polycrystalline Thin Film]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6928">[[File:8-inch-palmer-bowlus-flume.jpg|thumb|Fiberglass 8-inch Palmer-Bowlus flume]]The '''Palmer-Bowlus flume''', is a class of flumes commonly used to measure the flow of wastewater in sewer pipes and conduits. The Palmer-Bowlus flume has a u-shaped cross-section and was designed to be inserted into, or in line with, pipes and u-channels found in sanitary sewer applications.&lt;ref name=usbr/&gt;

As a long-throated flume, the point of measurement of the Palmer-Bowlus flume is anywhere upstream of the throat ramp greater than D/2 (D=flume size).  Montana flume has a single, specified point of measurement in the contracting section at which the level is measured.  Unlike most other flumes used for open channel flow measurement, the Palmer-Bowlus flume can be calibrated by theoretical analysis.

The general design of the flume detailed in ASTM D5390:  Standard Test Method for Open-Channel Flow Measurement of Water with Palmer-Bowlus Flumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/D5390.htm |title=Standard Test Method for Open-Channel Flow Measurement of Water with Palmer-Bowlus Flumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that unlike the [[Parshall flume]], the standard for the flume does not set out specific sizes and flow rates, but only general characteristics for the class of flume.

18 sizes of Palmer-Bowlus flumes have been developed - in line with the common pipe sizes to which they would be adapted - from 4-inches to 72-inches.  In practice, though, it is uncommon to see Palmer-Bowlus flumes greater than 24-inches in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/palmer-bowlus |title=Palmer-Bowlus Flumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under average flow conditions, the Palmer-Bowlus flume is accurate to within 3-5%.  For lower flow rates - where the depth is low relative to the length of the flume - the accuracy decreases to 5-6%.  This error, combined with typical installation / flow meter errors, means that overall site accuracy is somewhat less than other more common flumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/palmer-bowlus/palmer-bowlus-flow-characteristics |title=Palmer-Bowlus Flume Flow Characteristics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free-Flow Characteristics==

[[File:Palmer-bowlus-flume-irrigation.jpg|thumb|Palmer-Bowlus flume measuring irrigation flows]]Flow in the Palmer-Bowlus Flume transitions from a circular bottom section to a raised trapezoidal throat and then back - accelerating sub-critical flow ([[Froude number|Fr]]~0.5) to a supercritical state ([[Froude number|Fr]]&gt;1) to develop the level-to-flow relationship.

The simplified free-flow discharge can be summarized as

:&lt;math&gt;Q = C H_a^n&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''Q'' is flow rate
* ''C'' is the free-flow coefficient for the flume
* ''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the head at the primary point of measurement
* ''n'' varies with flume size (See Table 1 below)

Note that Palmer-Bowlus flumes are proprietary to each manufacturer / throat configuration. The table presented below is for the most common throat configuration - a trapezoidal ramp - and is simplified for the entire flume flow range.  For other throat configurations refer to the manufacturer's flow tables.&lt;ref name=usbr/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Throat Width !! Coefficient (C) !! Exponent (n)
|-

== Free-Flow vs. Submerged Flow==

Free-Flow – when there is no “back water” to restrict flow through a flume. Only the single depth (primary point of measurement - Ha) needs to be measured to calculate the flow rate. A free flow also induces a hydraulic jump downstream of the flume.

Submerged Flow – when the water surface downstream of the flume is high enough to restrict flow through a flume, the flume is deemed to be submerged.  Submergence transitions for Palmer-Bowlus flumes are quite high - 85-90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=25031687|title=Design of Palmer-Bowlus Flumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/palmer-bowlus/submergence |title=Palmer-Bowlus Flume Submergence}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, corrections for submerged flow in Palmer-Bowlus flumes have not been published.  As a result, it is important to set the flume so that it does not experience submerged flow conditions.  Although commonly thought of as occurring at higher flow rates, It should be noted that submerged flow can exist at any flow level as it is a function of downstream conditions.  In natural stream applications, submerged flow is frequently the result of vegetative growth on the downstream channel banks, sedimentation, or subsidence of the flume.

== Construction ==

Unlike other flumes - such as the [[Parshall flume|Parshall]], the Palmer-Bowlus flumes is typically only fabricated in two materials:

* Fiberglass (wastewater applications due to its corrosion resistance)
* Stainless steel (applications involving high temperatures / corrosive flow streams)

== Drawbacks ==

For standard Palmer-Bowlus flumes with the standard trapezoidal throat ramp:

* The flume may experience sedimentation / solids drop out upstream of the throat ramp.  This is particularly true the flow rates are low and the solids content is high or the solids heavy.
* Unlike other flumes where the design and discharge equations have been standardized, Palmer-Bowlus flume may not be readily programmed into the secondary flow meters commonly used with the flume.
*As a long-throated flume, the Palmer-Bowlus flume requires long straight runs upstream - 25 pipe diameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/5000141O.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1981+Thru+1985&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C81thru85%5CTxt%5C00000014%5C5000141O.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL |title=Recommended Practice for the Use of Parshall Flumes and Palmer-Bowlus Flumes in Wastewater Treatment Plants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Pittsburgh]] Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA)''' is a municipal authority in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It is responsible for water treatment and delivery systems in the city of Pittsburgh, as well as the city's sewer system. In a 2010 report, the authority reported 80,557 drinking water service connections and 107,151 sewage connections.&lt;ref name="2010 water quality report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgh2o.com/docs/2010_Water_Quality_Report.pdf|title=The Pittsburgh Water &amp; Sewer Authority 2010 Annual Drinking Water Quality Report|date=2010|publisher=Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority claims to serve approximately 250,000 customers, though it does not report how this number is calculated.&lt;ref name="PWSA about us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgh2o.com/aboutUs.htm|title=About Us|publisher=Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The population of the city in 2010 was 334,704.)

It is estimated that there are 930 miles of water lines and 7,300 Fire Hydrants.

== History ==
The PWSA was created in 1984 to oversee a $200 million capital improvement program focused on Pittsburgh's water treatment and distribution system.&lt;ref name="PWSA history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgh2o.com/history02.htm|title=History - Second Century |publisher=Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capital improvement program was primarily designed to ensure that the water system would meet various new requirements mandated by federal and state laws pertaining to safe drinking water.&lt;ref name="PWSA history"/&gt; 

The largest project undertaken in the initial years of the PWSA was to cover all open water reservoirs, replace them with closed tanks, or else enact another acceptable solution, such as the installation of a [[Water purification#Membrane filtration|membrane filtration]] plant at the open Highland Reservoir No. 1, which is the focal point of [[Highland Park (Pittsburgh)|Highland Park]].&lt;ref name="PWSA history"/&gt;

The City of Pittsburgh Water Department was absorbed by the PWSA in 1995, and in 1999, the PWSA also assumed the responsibility of operating and maintaining Pittsburgh's sewer system.&lt;ref name="PWSA history"/&gt;

== System statistics ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
* Water Treatment Plants:  2
* Pump Stations:  11
* Total Miles of Water Lines:  964
* Fire Hydrants:  7,462

The '''Pumpherston retort''' (also known as the '''Bryson retort''') was a type of [[Shale oil extraction|oil-shale retort]] used in [[Scotland]] at the end of 19th and beginning of 20th century.  It marked separation of the [[oil-shale industry]] from the [[coal industry]] as it was designed specifically for oil-shale retorting.&lt;ref name=iom&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The retort is named after [[Pumpherston]] town in Scotland, which was one of the major Scottish oil shale areas. The retort was commercialized by [[Pumpherston Oil Company]].

==History== 
The Pumpherston retort  was invented and patented in 1894 by William Fraser, James Bryson, and  James Jones of Pumpherston Oil Company.&lt;ref name=talbot&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The upper section was made of iron and the lower section was made of fire bricks.  The raw oil shale was fed on the top of retort. [[Shale oil]] and [[oil shale gas]] were distilled at the upper section at the temperature of {{convert|750|to|900|°F|°C}}.  At the lower section, the heat rose to {{convert|1300|°F|°C}} and steam was added to produce [[ammonia]].  The process required approximately {{convert|1000|impbbl}} of water equivalent of steam per one ton of oil shale.&lt;ref name=iom/&gt;&lt;ref name=alderson/&gt;&lt;ref name=hull&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The retort had a 15&amp;nbsp;ton capacity, and the residence time was 24&amp;nbsp;hours. It was started up by combustion of coal, but after the process started it was switched to the produced oil shale gas.&lt;ref name=iom/&gt;

Its objectives are to promote research in low temperature [[biology]], to improve scientific understanding in this field, and to disseminate and aid in the application of this knowledge. The Society also publishes a [[Academic journal|journal]] called ''Cryobiology''.

Although some members of the Society for Cryobiology encouraged or helped in the development of early-stage [[cryonics]] in the 1960s, the Society later on banned cryonicists from becoming members.&lt;ref name="cryobiology"&gt;{{cite news

'''Spirulina''' represents a [[biomass]] of [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) that can be consumed by humans and other animals. The two species are ''[[Arthrospira| Arthrospira platensis]]'' and ''A. maxima''.

Cultivated worldwide, ''Arthrospira'' is used as a [[dietary supplement]] or [[whole food]].&lt;ref name="medline-plus"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=MedlinePlus, National Library of Medicine, US National Institutes of Health |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/923.html |title= Blue-green algae |date= 1 November 2017 |accessdate= 11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a [[fodder|feed]] supplement in the [[aquaculture]], [[aquarium]], and [[poultry]] industries.&lt;ref name="vonshak"&gt;Vonshak, A.

== Etymology and ecology ==
[[File:Spira400xwetcr.jpg|350px|thumbnail|Spirulina powder at 400x, unstained wet mount]]
{{Main|Arthrospira}}
The species ''A. maxima'' and ''A. plaetensis'' were once classified in the genus [[Spirulina (genus)|''Spirulina'']]. The common name, spirulina, refers to the dried biomass of ''A. platensis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gershwin |first1=ME |last2=Belay |first2=A |date=2007|title=Spirulina in human nutrition and health | publisher= CRC Press, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; which belongs to [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] bacteria that cover the groups [[Cyanobacteria]] and [[Prochlorophyta]]. Scientifically, a distinction exists between spirulina and the genus ''Arthrospira''. Species of ''Arthrospira'' have been isolated from alkaline brackish and saline waters in tropical and subtropical regions. Among the various species included in the genus ''Arthrospira'', ''A. platensis'' is the most widely distributed and is mainly found in Africa, but also in Asia. ''A. maxima'' is believed to be found in California and Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The term ''spirulina'' remains in use for historical reasons.&lt;ref name="vonshak"/&gt;

''Arthrospira'' species are free-floating, filamentous cyanobacteria characterized by [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], multicellular [[trichome]]s in an open left-handed [[helix]]. They occur naturally in tropical and subtropical lakes with high [[pH]] and high concentrations of [[carbonate]] and [[bicarbonate]].&lt;ref name="FAO Spirulina Review" /&gt; ''A. platensis'' occurs in Africa, Asia, and South America, whereas ''A. maxima'' is confined to Central America.&lt;ref name="vonshak"/&gt; Most cultivated spirulina is produced in open-channel [[raceway pond]]s, with paddle wheels used to agitate the water.&lt;ref name="FAO Spirulina Review" /&gt;

Spirulina thrives at a pH around 8.5 and above, which will get more alkaline, and a temperature around 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F). They are [[autotrophic]], meaning that they are able to make their own food, and do not need a living energy or organic carbon source. In addition, a nutrient feed for [[Algaculture|growing it]] is:&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Yuanyuan, ''et al.''

==Historical use==
Spirulina was a food source for the [[Aztecs]] and other [[Mesoamericans]] until the 16th century; the harvest from [[Lake Texcoco]] in Mexico and subsequent sale as cakes were described by one of [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]]' soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Del Castillo, B. ''The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico, 1517–1521.'' London: Routledge, 1928, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OsborneKahn2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Osborne |first1=Ken |last2=Kahn |first2=Charles N. |title=World History: Societies of the Past |publisher=Portage &amp; Main Press |location=Winnipeg |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-55379-045-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztecs called it "tecuitlatl".&lt;ref name="FAO Spirulina Review"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Review on Culture, Production and Use of Spirulina as Food dor Humans and Feeds for Domestic Animals and Fish|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0424e/i0424e00.pdf|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of The United Nations|accessdate=November 20, 2011|last1=Habib |first1=M. Ahsan B. |last2=Parvin |first2=Mashuda |last3=Huntington |first3=Tim C. |last4= Hasan |first4=Mohammad R. |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirulina was found in abundance at [[Lake Texcoco]] by French researchers in the 1960s, but no reference to its use was made by the Aztecs as a daily food source after the 16th century, probably due to the draining of the surrounding lakes for agriculture and urban development.&lt;ref name="FAO Spirulina Review" /&gt; The topic of the Tecuitlalt, which was earlier discovered in 1520, was not mentioned again until 1940, the French phycologist Pierre Dangeard mentioned about a cake called “''dihe''”, consumed by Kanembu tribe, African Lake Chad, Kanem (Chad, Africa). Dangeard studied the “''dihe''” samples and found that it is like a puree of spring form blue algae. Spirulina has also been traditionally harvested in [[Chad]]. It is dried into ''dihé'', which is used to make broths for meals, and also sold in markets. The spirulina is harvested from small lakes and ponds around [[Lake Chad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abdulqader | first1 = G. | last2 = Barsanti | first2 = L. | last3 = Tredici | first3 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Harvest of Arthrospira platensis from Lake Kossorom (Chad) and its household usage among the Kanembu | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/l7027v518x1g7p84/ | journal = Journal of Applied Phycology | volume = 12 | issue = 3/5| pages = 493–498 | doi=10.1023/A:1008177925799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1964 and 1965, the botanist Jean Leonard confirmed that ''dihe'' is made up of spirulina, and later studied a bloom of algae in a [[sodium hydroxide]] production facility. As a result, the first systematic and detailed study of the growth requirements and physiology of spirulina was performed as a basis for establishing large-scale production in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="vonshak" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As an [[ecology|ecologically]] sound, nutrient-rich, [[dietary supplement]], spirulina is being investigated to address [[food security]] and [[malnutrition]], and as dietary support in long-term [[space flight]] or [[Mars]] missions.&lt;ref name="riley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/12/spirulina-health-food-panacea-malnutrition|title=Spirulina: a luxury health food and a panacea for malnutrition|author=Riley, Tess|publisher=The Guardian, London, UK|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Ready_for_dinner_on_Mars|title=Ready for dinner on Mars?|publisher=European Space Agency|date=13 June 2005|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its interest for food security is for lower land and water needs to produce protein and energy than required for [[livestock]] as meat sources.&lt;ref name=riley/&gt;

Dried spirulina contains 5% water, 24% [[carbohydrates]], 8% [[fat]], and about 60% (51&amp;ndash;71%) [[protein]] (table).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan|first1=Z|last2=Bhadouria|first2=P|last3=Bisen |first3=PS|title=Nutritional and therapeutic potential of Spirulina.|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology|date=October 2005|volume=6|issue=5|pages=373–9|pmid=16248810|doi=10.2174/138920105774370607}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campanella|first1=L|last2=Russo|first2=MV|last3=Avino|first3=P|title=Free and total amino acid composition in blue-green algae.|journal=Annali di Chimica|date=April 2002|volume=92|issue=4|pages=343–52|pmid=12073880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provided in its typical supplement form as a dried powder, a 100-g amount of spirulina supplies 290 [[Calories]] and is a rich source (20% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of numerous [[essential nutrients]], particularly [[protein]], [[B vitamins]] ([[thiamin]] and [[riboflavin]], 207% and 306% DV, respectively), and [[dietary minerals]], such as [[iron]] (219% DV) and [[manganese]] (90% DV) (table).

=== Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;===
Spirulina does not contain [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] naturally (see table), and spirulina supplements are not considered to be a reliable source of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, as they contain predominantly pseudovitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (Coα-[α-(7-adenyl)]-Coβ-cyanocobamide),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = FEBS Lett. |date = 2007 | volume=581 |issue=25 | pages=4865–70 | title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the corrinoid produced by Lactobacillus reuteri CRL1098 under anaerobic conditions | author=Santos F, Vera JL, Lamosa P, de Valdez GF, de Vos WM, Santos H, Sesma F, Hugenholtz J|pmid = 17888910 |doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2007.09.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is biologically inactive in humans.&lt;ref name="watanabe-review"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ADA2009/&gt; In a 2009 position paper on [[vegetarian]] diets, the [[American Dietetic Association]] stated that spirulina is not a reliable source of active vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ADA2009"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19562864|year=2009|author1=Craig|first1=WJ|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian diets|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|volume=109|issue=7|pages=1266–82|last2=Mangels|first2=AR|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S0002-8223(09)00700-7/fulltext|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2009.05.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical literature similarly advises that spirulina is unsuitable as a source of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="watanabe-review"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Watanabe |first=F |title= Vitamin B12 sources and bioavailability. |year= 2007 |journal= Exp.

==Risks==
Spirulina may have [[adverse effect|adverse interactions]] when taken with [[prescription drug]]s, particularly those affecting the [[immune system]] and [[blood clotting]].&lt;ref name=medline-plus/&gt;

=== Quality-related safety and toxicology ===

Spirulina is a form of cyanobacterium, some of which are known to produce toxins such as [[microcystins]], [[BMAA]], and others. Some spirulina supplements have been found to be contaminated with microcystins, albeit at levels below the limit set by the Oregon Health Department.&lt;ref name="gilroy"/&gt; Microcystins can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, and in the long term, [[liver damage]].&lt;ref name=medline-plus/&gt; The effects of chronic exposure to even very low levels of microcystins are of concern, because of the potential risk of toxicity to several organ systems&lt;ref name=medline-plus/&gt; and possibly cancer.&lt;ref name="gilroy"/&gt;

These toxic compounds are not produced by spirulina itself,&lt;ref name="belay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belay|first=Amha|title=Spirulina (Arthrospira): Production and Quality Assurance|journal=Spirulina in Human Nutrition and Health, CRC Press|year=2008|pages=1–25|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Spirulina_in_Human_Nutrition_and_Health.html?id=Vz7SpjEsE3IC|isbn=9781420052572}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may occur as a result of contamination of spirulina batches with other toxin-producing blue-green algae. Because spirulina is considered a [[dietary supplement]] in the U.S., no active, industry-wide regulation of its production occurs and no enforced safety standards exist for its production or purity.&lt;ref name="gilroy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gilroy |first1=D. |last2=Kauffman |first2=K. |last3=Hall |first3=D. |last4=Huang |first4=X. |last5=Chu |first5=F. |display-authors=3 |title= Assessing potential health risks from microcystin toxins in blue-green algae dietary supplements |journal= Environmental Health Perspectives |volume= 108 |issue= 5 |pages= 435–439 |doi= 10.2307/3454384 |pmc= 1638057 |pmid= 10811570 |year= 2000 |jstor= 3454384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] describes spirulina supplements as "possibly safe", provided they are free of microcystin contamination, but "likely unsafe" (especially for children) if contaminated.&lt;ref name=medline-plus/&gt; Given the lack of regulatory standards in the U.S., some public-health researchers have raised the concern that consumers cannot be certain that spirulina and other blue-green algae supplements are free of contamination.&lt;ref name="gilroy"/&gt;

Heavy-metal contamination of spirulina supplements has also raised concern. The Chinese [[State Food and Drug Administration]] reported that [[lead (metal)|lead]], [[mercury (metal)|mercury]], and [[arsenic]] contamination was widespread in spirulina supplements marketed in China.&lt;ref name="wp-china"&gt;{{cite news |work= [[Washington Post]] |title= China’s drug agency rejects state media claims of cover-up in lead found in health supplement |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinas-drug-agency-rejects-state-media-claims-of-tainted-spirulina-cover-up/2012/04/10/gIQAaEbt7S_story.html |date= April 10, 2012 |accessdate= April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study reported the presence of [[lead]] up to 5.1 ppm in a sample from a commercial supplement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.jnutres.com/2018/09/spirulina-in-combating-protein-energy.html?m=1|title = Spirulina in combating Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and Protein Energy Wasting (PEW) - A review|author= Siva Kiran RR, Madhu GM, Satyanarayana SV|date = 2015|journal = Journal of Nutrition Research|volume=3|issue=1|pages=62–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirulina doses of 10 to 19 grams per day over several months have been used safely.&lt;ref name=medline-plus/&gt; [[Adverse effect]]s may include [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], fatigue, or headache.&lt;ref name=medline-plus/&gt;

=== Safety issues for certain target groups ===
Like all protein-rich foods, spirulina contains the essential amino acid [[phenylalanine]] (2.6-4.1 g/100 g),&lt;ref name="FAO Spirulina Review" /&gt; which should be avoided by people who have [[phenylketonuria]], a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from metabolizing phenylalanine, which then builds up in the brain, causing damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Robb-Nicholson |first=C. |title= By the way, doctor |journal= Harvard Women's Health Watch |volume= 8 |year= 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirulina contaminated with microcystins has various potential toxicity, especially to children,&lt;ref name="tap"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Toxin content and cytotoxicity of algal dietary supplements | author=Heussner AH, Mazija L, Fastner J, Dietrich DR | journal=Toxicol Appl Pharmacol | year=2012 | volume=265 | issue=2 | pages=263–71 | doi=10.1016/j.taap.2012.10.005 | pmid=23064102}}&lt;/ref&gt; including liver damage, [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] and death.&lt;ref name=medline-plus/&gt;

'''Sunlight''' is a portion of the [[electromagnetic radiation]] given off by the [[Sun]], in particular [[infrared]], [[Light|visible]], and [[ultraviolet]] light. On [[Earth]], sunlight is [[Filter (optics)|filtered]] through [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], and is obvious as [[daylight]] when the Sun is above the [[horizon]]. When the direct [[solar radiation]] is not blocked by [[clouds]], it is experienced as '''sunshine''', a combination of bright [[light]] and [[radiant heat]]. When it is blocked by [[Clouds (meteorology)|clouds]] or [[diffuse reflection|reflects off other objects]], it is experienced as diffused light. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] uses the term "[[sunshine duration]]" to mean the cumulative time during which an area receives direct [[irradiance]] from the Sun of at least 120 [[watt]]s per [[square meter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/CIMO%20Guide%207th%20Edition,%202008/Part%20I/Chapter%208.pdf | format=PDF | title=Chapter 8 – Measurement of sunshine duration | work=CIMO Guide | publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]] | accessdate=2008-12-01 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515064722/http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/CIMO%20Guide%207th%20Edition,%202008/Part%20I/Chapter%208.pdf | archivedate=2016-05-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources indicate an "Average over the entire earth" of "164 Watts per square meter over a 24 hour day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/disted/ph162/l4.html | title=Basics of Solar | accessdate=2016-12-06 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128021408/http://zebu.uoregon.edu/disted/ph162/l4.html | archivedate=2016-11-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a requisite for [[vitamin D3|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] synthesis and a [[mutagen]].

Sunlight takes about 8.3&amp;nbsp;minutes to reach Earth from the surface of the Sun. A photon starting at the center of the Sun and changing direction every time it encounters a [[charged particle]] would take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to get to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2007/locations/ttt_sunlight.php |title= NASA: The 8-minute travel time to Earth by sunlight hides a thousand-year journey that actually began in the core |publisher= NASA, ''sunearthday.nasa.gov'' |accessdate= 2012-02-12 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/64scmqfqS?url=http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2007/locations/ttt_sunlight.php |archivedate= 2012-01-22 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight is a key factor in [[photosynthesis]], the process used by plants and other [[autotroph]]ic organisms to convert [[light energy]], normally from the Sun, into [[chemical energy]] that can be used to synthesize carbohydrates and to fuel the organisms' activities.

==Measurement==
Researchers can measure the intensity of sunlight using a [[sunshine recorder]], [[pyranometer]], or [[pyrheliometer]]. To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, both the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of Earth's [[elliptic orbit]] and the [[Extinction (astronomy)#Atmospheric extinction|attenuation]] by [[Earth's atmosphere]] have to be taken into account. The extraterrestrial solar illuminance ({{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;}}), corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year (dn), is given to a good approximation by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. KANDILLI|author2=K. ULGEN|last-author-amp=yes|title=Solar Illumination and Estimating Daylight Availability of Global Solar Irradiance|journal=Energy Sources}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm ext}= E_{\rm sc} \cdot \left(1+0.033412 \cdot \cos\left(2\pi\frac{{\rm dn}-3}{365}\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where dn=1 on January&amp;nbsp;1st; dn=32 on February&amp;nbsp;1st; dn=59 on March 1 (except on leap years, where dn=60), etc. In this formula dn–3 is used, because in modern times [[Apsis#Earth's perihelion and aphelion|Earth's perihelion]], the closest approach to the Sun and, therefore, the maximum {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;}} occurs around January&amp;nbsp;3 each year. The value of 0.033412 is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion (0.98328989&amp;nbsp;AU) squared and the aphelion (1.01671033&amp;nbsp;AU) squared should be approximately 0.935338.

The solar illuminance constant ({{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;}}), is equal to 128×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Lux|lx]]. The direct normal illuminance ({{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;dn&lt;/sub&gt;}}), corrected for the attenuating effects of the atmosphere is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm dn}=E_{\rm ext}\,e^{-cm},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|c}} is the [[atmospheric extinction]] and {{mvar|m}} is the relative optical [[airmass]]. The atmospheric extinction brings the number of lux down to around 100 000.

The total amount of energy received at ground level from the Sun at the zenith depends on the distance to the Sun and thus on the time of year. It is about 3.3% higher than average in January and 3.3% lower in July (see below). If the extraterrestrial solar radiation is 1367 watts per square meter (the value when the Earth–Sun distance is 1 [[astronomical unit]]), then the direct sunlight at Earth's surface when the Sun is at the [[zenith]] is about 1050 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but the total amount (direct and indirect from the atmosphere) hitting the ground is around 1120 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Solar constant at ground level"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Solar Radiation|url= http://www.newport.com/Introduction-to-Solar-Radiation/411919/1033/content.aspx|publisher= Newport Corporation|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029234117/http://www.newport.com/Introduction-to-Solar-Radiation/411919/1033/content.aspx|archivedate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of energy, sunlight at Earth's surface is around 52 to 55 percent infrared (above 700 [[nanometre|nm]]), 42 to 43 percent visible (400 to 700&amp;nbsp;nm), and 3 to 5 percent ultraviolet (below 400&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;Calculated from data in {{cite web|url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5|accessdate=2009-11-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011257/http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ASTMG173/ASTMG173.xls|archivedate=September 28, 2013|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory}} The first of each set of two figures is for total solar radiation reaching a panel aimed at the Sun (which is 42° above the horizon), whereas the second figure of each pair is the "direct plus circumsolar" radiation (circumsolar meaning coming from the part of the sky within a couple degrees of the Sun). The totals, from 280 to 4000 nm, are 1000.4 and 900.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively. It would be good to have more direct figures from a good source, rather than summing thousands of numbers in a database.&lt;/ref&gt; At the top of the atmosphere, sunlight is about 30% more intense, having about 8% [[ultraviolet]] (UV),&lt;ref&gt;Calculated from the ASTM spectrum cited above.&lt;/ref&gt; with most of the extra UV consisting of biologically damaging short-wave ultraviolet.&lt;ref name="Solar radiation"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{vanchor|Direct sunlight}} has a [[luminous efficacy]] of about 93&amp;nbsp;[[lumen (unit)|lumens]] per watt of [[radiant flux]]. This is higher than the efficacy (of source) of most [[artificial lighting]] (including fluorescent), which means using sunlight for illumination heats up a room less than using most forms of artificial lighting.&lt;!--This depends on the efficacy of source, not of radiation, for the artificial lighting. For the sun, LER=LES, so there's no need to specify which one the 93 is. (User:Eric Kvaalen)--&gt;

Multiplying the figure of 1050 watts per square metre by 93 lumens per watt indicates that bright sunlight provides an [[illuminance]] of approximately 98 000 [[lux]] ([[lumen (unit)|lumens]] per square meter) on a perpendicular surface at sea level. The illumination of a horizontal surface will be considerably less than this if the Sun is not very high in the sky. Averaged over a day, the highest amount of sunlight on a horizontal surface occurs in January at the [[South Pole]] (see [[insolation]]).

Dividing the [[irradiance]] of 1050&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by the size of the sun's disk in [[steradian]]s gives an average [[radiance]] of 15.4&amp;nbsp;MW per square metre per steradian. (However, the radiance at the centre of the sun's disk is somewhat higher than the average over the whole disk due to [[limb darkening]].) Multiplying this by π gives an upper limit to the irradiance which can be focused on a surface using mirrors: 48.5&amp;nbsp;MW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{Main|Solar constant}}

[[File:Solar irradiance spectrum 1992.gif|thumb|Solar irradiance spectrum at top of atmosphere, on a linear scale and plotted against [[wavenumber]]]]

The '''solar constant''', a measure of [[flux density]], is the amount of incoming solar [[electromagnetic radiation]] per unit area that would be incident on a plane perpendicular to the rays, at a distance of one [[Astronomical unit|astronomical unit (AU)]] (roughly the mean distance from the Sun to Earth). The "solar constant" includes all types of solar radiation, not just the [[visible light]].

It has been found that SSI at UV (ultraviolet) wavelength corresponds in a less clear, and probably more complicated fashion, with Earth's climate responses than earlier assumed, fueling broad avenues of new research in “the connection of the Sun and stratosphere, troposphere, biosphere, ocean, and Earth’s climate”.&lt;ref name=goddard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atmospheres.gsfc.nasa.gov/climate/index.php?section=136 |title=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center: Solar Radiation |publisher=Atmospheres.gsfc.nasa.gov |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-02-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110920123747/http://atmospheres.gsfc.nasa.gov/climate/index.php?section=136 |archivedate=2011-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different bodies of the [[Solar System]] receive light of an intensity inversely proportional to the square of their distance from Sun. A rough table comparing the amount of solar radiation received by each planet in the Solar System follows (from data in [https://web.archive.org/web/20091122194548/http://starhop.com/library/pdf/studyguide/high/SolInt-19.pdf]):

The actual brightness of sunlight that would be observed at the surface depends also on the presence and composition of an [[atmosphere]]. For example, [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus's thick atmosphere]] reflects more than 60% of the solar light it receives. The actual illumination of the surface is about 14,000&amp;nbsp;lux, comparable to that on Earth "in the daytime with overcast clouds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Unveiling of Venus: Hot and Stifling |journal=Science News |volume=109 |issue=25 |date=1976-06-19 |page=388 |quote=100 watts per square meter ... 14,000 lux ... corresponds to ... daytime with overcast clouds |jstor=3960800 |doi=10.2307/3960800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight on Mars would be more or less like daylight on Earth during a slightly overcast day, and, as can be seen in the pictures taken by the rovers, there is enough [[diffuse sky radiation]] that shadows would not seem particularly dark. Thus, it would give perceptions and "feel" very much like Earth daylight. The spectrum on the surface is slightly redder than that on Earth, due to scattering by reddish dust in the Martian atmosphere.

For comparison,  sunlight on Saturn is slightly brighter than Earth sunlight at the average sunset or sunrise (see [[daylight]] for comparison table). Even on Pluto, the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room. To see sunlight as dim as full [[moonlight]] on Earth, a distance of about 500&amp;nbsp;AU (~69&amp;nbsp;[[light-hour]]s) is needed; there are only a handful of objects in the Solar System known to orbit farther than such a distance, among them [[90377 Sedna]] and {{mpl|(87269) 2000 OO|67}}.

== Surface illumination ==
The spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects, with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset, respectively, and red dominating during sunrise and sunset. These effects are apparent in natural light [[photography]] where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere.

While the color of the sky is usually determined by [[Rayleigh scattering]], an exception occurs at sunset and twilight. "Preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|title=Atmospheric Optics|author=Craig Bohren|author-link=Craig Bohren|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206175627/http://homepages.wmich.edu/%7Ekorista/atmospheric_optics.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[diffuse sky radiation]] for more details.

=== Spectral composition of sunlight at Earth's surface ===
The Sun's electromagnetic radiation which is received at the Earth's surface is predominantly light that falls within the range of wavelengths to which the visual systems of the animals that inhabit Earth's surface are sensitive. The Sun may therefore be said to [[Lighting|illuminate]], which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range. Many animals (including humans) have a sensitivity range of approximately 400–700&amp;nbsp;nm,&lt;ref name="BuserImbert1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buser|first1=Pierre A.|last2=Imbert|first2=Michel|title=Vision|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSZvt8Ld2-8C&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=11 October 2013|date=1992|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-02336-8|page=50|quote=Light is a special class of radiant energy embracing wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm (or mμ), or 4000 to 7000 Å.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given optimal conditions the absorption and scattering by Earth's atmosphere produces illumination that approximates an [[Standard illuminant|equal-energy illuminant]] for most of this range.&lt;ref name="MacEvoy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacEvoy|first1=Bruce|title=color vision|date=2008|url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html|accessdate=27 August 2015|quote=Noon sunlight (D55) has a nearly flat distribution...|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024814/http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The useful range for color vision in humans, for example, is approximately 450–650&amp;nbsp;nm. Aside from effects that arise at sunset and sunrise, the spectral composition changes primarily in respect to how directly sunlight is able to illuminate. When illumination is indirect, [[Rayleigh scattering]] in the upper atmosphere will lead blue wavelengths to dominate. Water vapour in the lower atmosphere produces further scattering and ozone, dust and water particles will also absorb selective wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Wyszecki_and_Stiles"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyszecki|first1=Günter|last2=Stiles|first2=W.

==Variations in solar irradiance==

===Seasonal and orbital variation===
{{Further|Insolation|Sunshine duration}}
On Earth, the solar radiation varies with the angle of the sun above the [[horizon]], with longer sunlight duration at high latitudes during summer, varying to no sunlight at all in winter near the pertinent pole. When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced as ''sunshine''. The warming of the ground (and other objects) depends on the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption of the electromagnetic radiation]] in the form of [[heat]].

The amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet. Earth's [[orbit]] and [[obliquity]] change with time (over thousands of years), sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle, and at other times stretching out to an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 5% (currently 1.67%). As the orbital eccentricity changes, the average distance from the sun (the [[semimajor axis]] does not significantly vary, and so the total [[insolation]] over a year remains almost constant due to [[Kepler's second law]],
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the "areal velocity" invariant. That is, the integration over the orbital period (also invariant) is a constant.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{T} \tfrac{2A}{r^2}dt = \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\theta = \mathrm{constant}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we assume the solar radiation power&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|P}} as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the [[inverse-square law]], we obtain also the average insolation as a constant.

But the [[seasonal]] and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth's surface does vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |title=Graph of variation of seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2012-02-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112043906/http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/insolation_graph.html |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[effect of sun angle on climate]] results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter.  For example, at [[latitude]]s of 65&amp;nbsp;degrees, this can vary by more than 25% as a result of Earth's orbital variation. Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset, the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero, but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles. Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent [[ice age]]s (see: [[Milankovitch cycles]]).

===Solar intensity variation===
{{Further|Solar variation}}
Space-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies on many time scales, including the 11-year sunspot solar cycle.&lt;ref name="acrim"/&gt; When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400&amp;nbsp;years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back&amp;nbsp;10,000 years.
Such reconstructions have been done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713 | last1 = Wang | display-authors = etal   | date = 2005 | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 625 | issue = 1| pages = 522–538 | doi = 10.1086/429689 | bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Total solar irradiance since 1996: is there a long-term variation unrelated to solar surface magnetic phenomena? | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2009 | url = | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = | page = L19704 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/200811446 | bibcode=2010A&amp;A...523A..39S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the solar irradiance during the Holocene | last1 = Vieira | display-authors = etal   | date = 2011 | url = | journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume = 531 | issue = | page = A6 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201015843 | bibcode=2011A&amp;A...531A...6V|arxiv = 1103.4958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = 9,400 years of cosmic radiation and solar activity from ice cores and tree rings | last1 = Steinhilber | display-authors = etal   | date = 2012 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109| issue = | pages = 5967–5971| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1118965109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5967S | pmid=22474348 | pmc=3341045| url = http://epic.awi.de/30297/1/PNAS-2012-Steinhilber-1118965109.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle (the (Schwabe) cycle), the solar activitiy varies with longer cycles, such as the proposed 88 year ([[Gleisberg cycle]]), 208 year ([[DeVries cycle]]) and 1,000 year ([[Eddy cycle]]).

==Life on Earth==
The existence of nearly all [[Organism|life on Earth]] is fueled by light from the Sun. Most [[autotroph]]s, such as plants, use the energy of sunlight, combined with carbon dioxide and water, to produce simple sugars—a process known as [[photosynthesis]]. These sugars are then used as building-blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow.

[[Heterotroph]]s, such as animals, use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs, either by consuming autotrophs, by consuming their products, or by consuming other heterotrophs. The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival. This process is known as [[cellular respiration]].

In [[prehistory]], humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses. They used animal skins for warmth, for example, or wooden weapons to hunt. These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone, and human population began to grow.

During the [[Neolithic Revolution]], the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy. Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter, providing sugars and [[nutrients]] for future harvests. Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives, fueled by [[grasses]] inedible to humans.

The more recent discoveries of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are modern extensions of this trend. These [[fossil fuel]]s are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter, formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years. Because the stored energy in these fossil fuels has accumulated over many millions of years, they have allowed modern humans to massively increase the production and consumption of [[primary energy]]. As the amount of fossil fuel is large but finite, this cannot continue indefinitely, and various theories exist as to what will follow this stage of human civilization (e.g., [[alternative fuels]], [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[new urbanism]], [[peak oil]]).

==Cultural aspects==

[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Eduard Manet]]: ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'']]
The effect of sunlight is relevant to [[painting]], evidenced for instance in works of [[Eduard Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]] on outdoor scenes and landscapes.
[[File:Winter Sunshine.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|''Téli verőfény'' ("Winter Sunshine") by [[László Mednyánszky]]]]
Many people find direct sunlight to be too [[brightness|bright]] for comfort, especially when reading from white paper upon which the sun is directly shining. Indeed, looking directly at the sun can cause long-term vision damage. To compensate for the brightness of sunlight, many people wear [[sunglasses]]. [[Automobile|Cars]], many [[helmet]]s and [[cap]]s are equipped with [[visor]]s to block the sun from direct vision when the sun is at a low angle. Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of [[wall]]s, [[window blind]]s, [[awning]]s, [[Window shutter|shutters]], [[curtain]]s, or nearby [[shade tree]]s. Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the creation of [[Vitamin D]] in the skin, a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body.

In colder countries, many people prefer sunnier days and often avoid the [[Shade (shadow)|shade]]. In hotter countries, the converse is true; during the midday hours, many people prefer to stay inside to remain cool. If they do go outside, they seek shade that may be provided by trees, [[Umbrella|parasols]], and so on.

In many world religions, such as [[Hinduism]], the sun is considered to be a god, as it is the source of life and energy on earth. It also formed the basis for religion in [[Ancient Egypt]].

===Sunbathing===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Naturism]] --&gt;
{{main|Sun tanning}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Sunbathing is a popular [[leisure]] activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine. People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight. Some common places for sunbathing include [[beach]]es, open air [[swimming pool]]s, [[park]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[sidewalk cafe]]s. Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go [[Nudity|nude]]. For some, an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a [[Tanning bed|sunbed]] that generates [[ultraviolet]] light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions. Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world.

For many people with light skin, one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one's [[Human skin color|skin color]] (get a sun tan), as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive, associated with outdoor activity, [[Vacation|vacations/holidays]], and health. Some people prefer [[Naturism|naked]] sunbathing so that an "all-over" or "even" tan can be obtained, sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle.

Controlled [[heliotherapy]], or sunbathing, has been used as a treatment for [[psoriasis]] and other maladies.

Skin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called [[melanocyte]]s, and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or from artificial sunlamps. Thus, the tan gradually disappears with time, when one is no longer exposed to these sources.

==Effects on human health==
{{main|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}
The [[ultraviolet radiation]] in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects, as it is both a principal source of [[vitamin D3|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and a [[mutagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12174089 | volume=147 | issue=2 | title=Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma? |date=August 2002 | journal=Br.

In [[solid state physics]], a '''surface phonon''' is the [[quantum]] of a lattice vibration mode associated with a solid surface. Similar to the ordinary lattice vibrations in a bulk solid (whose quanta are simply called [[phonon]]s), the nature of surface vibrations depends on details of periodicity and [[symmetry]] of a [[crystal structure]]. Surface vibrations are however distinct from the bulk vibrations, as they arise from the abrupt termination of a crystal structure at the surface of a solid. Knowledge of surface [[Phonon#Dispersion relation|phonon dispersion]] gives important information related to the amount of surface relaxation, the existence and distance between an [[adsorbate]] and the surface, and information regarding presence, quantity, and type of defects existing on the surface.&lt;ref name=Szeftel&gt;J. Szeftel, "Surface phonon dispersion, using electron energy loss spectroscopy," ''Surface Science'', '''152/153''' (1985) 797-810, {{doi|10.1016/0039-6028(85)90490-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern semiconductor research, surface vibrations are of interest as they can couple with [[electron]]s and thereby affect the electrical and optical properties of semiconductor devices. They are most relevant for devices where the electronic active area is near a surface, as is the case in [[two-dimensional electron system]]s and in [[quantum dot]]s. As a specific example, the decreasing size of [[CdSe]] quantum dots was found to result in increasing frequency of the surface vibration resonance, which can couple with electrons and affect their properties.&lt;ref name=Hwang&gt;Y.-N. Hwang and S.-H. Park, "Size-dependent surface phonon mode of CdSe quantum dots," ''Physical Review B'' '''59''', 7285-7288 (1999), {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevB.59.7285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two methods are used for modeling surface phonons. One is the "slab method", which approaches the problem using lattice dynamics for a solid with parallel surfaces,&lt;ref name=Kress&gt;W. Kress and F. W. de Wette, "Study of surface phonons by the slab method," ''Surface Phonons'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and the other is based on [[Green's function]]s. Which of these approaches is employed is based upon what type of information is required from the computation. For broad surface phonon phenomena, the conventional lattice dynamics method can be used; for the study of lattice defects, resonances, or phonon state density, the Green's function method yields more useful results.&lt;ref name=Toennies&gt;J. P. Toennies, "[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-75785-3_5 Experimental determination of surface phonons by helium atom and electron energy loss spectroscopy]", ''Surface Phonons'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum description==

Surface phonons are represented by a [[wave vector]] along the surface, '''q''', and an energy corresponding to a particular vibrational mode frequency, ω. The surface [[Brillouin zone]] (SBZ) for phonons consists of two dimensions, rather than three for bulk. For example, the [[face centered cubic]] (100) surface is described by the directions ΓX and ΓM, referring to the [110] direction and [100] direction, respectively.&lt;ref name=Kress/&gt; 

The description of the atomic displacements by the harmonic approximation assumes that the force on an atom is a function of its displacement with respect to neighboring atoms, i.e. [[Hooke's law]] holds.&lt;ref name=Bruesch&gt;P. Brüesch, ''Phonons: Theory and Experiments I: Lattice Dynamics and Models of Interatomic Forces'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Higher order anharmonicity terms can be accounted by using [[Perturbation theory|perturbative methods]].&lt;ref name=Morse&gt;P. M. Morse, "Diatomic Molecules According to the Wave Mechanics. II. Vibrational Levels," ''Physical Review'' '''34''', 57 (1929), {{doi|10.1103/PhysRev.34.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The positions are then given by the relation

::&lt;math&gt; m_i \ddot u_{i \alpha} = - \sum _{j, \beta } \phi_{i \alpha , j \beta } u_{j, \beta } &lt;/math&gt;

where i is the place where the atom would sit if it were in equilibrium, m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the atom that should sit at i, α is the direction of its displacement, u&lt;sub&gt;i,α&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of displacement of the atom from i, and &lt;math&gt; \phi_{i \alpha,j \beta} &lt;/math&gt; are the force constants which come from the crystal potential.&lt;ref name=Szeftel/&gt; 

The solution to this gives the atomic displacement due to the phonon, which is given by

::&lt;math&gt; u_{l,m, \kappa , \alpha} = \sqrt{(m_\kappa )} v_{l, \kappa , \alpha } (\omega , q) e^{i[\omega t - q x (l,m)]} &lt;/math&gt;

where the atomic position i is described by l, m, and κ, which represent the specific atomic layer, l, the particular unit cell it is in, m, and the position of the atom with respect to its own unit cell, κ. The term x(l,m) is the position of the unit cell with respect to some chosen origin.&lt;ref name=Szeftel/&gt;

==Normal modes of vibration and types of surfaces phonons==

Phonons can be labeled by the manner in which the vibrations occur. If the vibration occurs lengthwise in the direction of the wave and involves contraction and relaxation of the lattice, the phonon is called a "longitudinal phonon". Alternatively, the atoms may vibrate side-to-side, perpendicular to wave propagation direction; this is known as a "transverse phonon”. In general, transverse vibrations tend to have smaller frequencies than longitudinal vibrations.&lt;ref name=Bruesch/&gt; 

The wavelength of the vibration also lends itself to a second label. "Acoustic" branch phonons have a wavelength of vibration that is much bigger than the atomic separation so that the wave travels in the same manner as a sound wave; "optical" phonons can be excited by optical radiation in the infrared wavelength or longer.&lt;ref name=Bruesch/&gt; Phonons take on both labels such that transverse acoustic and optical phonons are denoted TA and TO, respectively; likewise, longitudinal acoustic and optical phonons are denoted LA and LO.

The type of surface phonon can be characterized by its dispersion in relation to the bulk phonon modes of the crystal. Surface phonon mode branches may occur in specific parts of the SBZ or encompass it entirely across.&lt;ref name=Szeftel/&gt; These modes can show up both in the bulk phonon dispersion bands as what is known as a resonance or outside these bands as a pure surface phonon mode.&lt;ref name=Toennies/&gt; Thus surface phonons can be purely surface existing vibrations, or simply the expression of bulk vibrations in the presence of a surface, known as a surface-excess property.&lt;ref name=Kress/&gt;
 
A particular mode, the Rayleigh phonon mode, exists across the entire BZ and is known by special characteristics, including a linear frequency versus wave number relation near the SBZ center.&lt;ref name=Szeftel/&gt;

==Experiment==

Two of the more common methods for studying surface phonons are [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]] and [[helium atom scattering]].

===Electron energy loss spectroscopy===

The technique of [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]] (EELS) is based upon the fact that electron energy decreases upon interaction with matter. Since the interaction of low energy electrons is mainly in the surface, the loss is due to surface phonon scattering, which have an energy range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; eV to 1 eV.&lt;ref name=Oura&gt;K. Oura, V. G. Lifshits, A. A. Saranin, A. V. Zotov and M. Katayama, ''Surface Science: An Introduction'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg (2003), https://www.springer.com/materials/surfaces+interfaces/book/978-3-540-00545-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In EELS, an electron of known energy is incident upon the crystal, a phonon of some wave number, '''q''', and frequency, ω, is then created, and the outgoing electron's energy and wave number are measured.&lt;ref name=Szeftel/&gt; If the incident electron energy, E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and wave number, k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, are chosen for the experiment and the scattered electron energy, E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, and wave number, k&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, are known by measurement, as well as the angles with respect to the normal for the incident and scattered electrons, θ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and θ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, then values of q throughout the BZ can be obtained.&lt;ref name=Szeftel/&gt; Energy and momentum for the electron have the following relation,

::&lt;math&gt; E = \frac { \hbar^2  k^2} {2m} &lt;/math&gt;

where m is the mass of an electron. Energy and momentum must be conserved, so the following relations must be true of the energy and momentum exchange throughout the encounter:

::&lt;math&gt; \Delta E = | E_i - E_s | = \hbar \omega &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \Delta K = k_i (sin \theta_i ) - k_s (sin \theta_s) = &lt;/math&gt; '''G''' + '''q'''

where '''G''' is a reciprocal lattice vector that ensures that '''q''' falls in the first BZ and the angles θ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and θ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; are measured with respect to the normal to the surface.&lt;ref name=Toennies/&gt;

The dispersion is often shown with '''q''' given in units of cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, in which 100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 12.41 meV.&lt;ref name="Oura" /&gt; The electron incident angles for most EELS phonon study chambers can range from 135-θ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and 90-θ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for θ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; ranging between 55-65°.&lt;ref name=Toennies/&gt;

===Helium atom scattering===

Helium is the best suited atom to be used for surface scattering techniques, as it has a low enough mass that multiple phonon scattering events are unlikely, and its closed valence electron shell makes it inert, unlikely to bond with the surface upon which it impinges. In particular, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He is used because this isotope allows for very precise velocity control, important for obtaining maximum resolution in the experiment.&lt;ref name=Toennies/&gt;

There are two main techniques used for [[helium atom scattering]] studies. One is a so-called time-of-flight measurement which consists of sending pulses of He atoms at the crystal surface and then measuring the scattered atoms after the pulse. The He beam velocity ranges from 644–2037&amp;nbsp;m/s. The other involves measuring the momentum of the scattered He atoms by a [[LiF]] grating monochromator.&lt;ref name=Toennies/&gt;

It is important to note that the He nozzle beam source used in many He scattering experiments poses some risk of error, as it adds components to the velocity distributions that can mimic phonon peaks; particularly in time-of-flight measurements, these peaks can look very much like inelastic phonon peaks. Thus, these false peaks have come to be known by the names "deceptons" or "phonions".&lt;ref name=Toennies/&gt;

===Comparison of techniques===

EELS and helium scattering techniques each have their own particular merits that warrant the use of either depending on the sample type, resolution desired, etc. Helium scattering has a higher resolution than EELS, with a resolution of 0.5-1 meV compared to 7 meV. However, He scattering is available only for energy differences, E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, of less than about 30 meV, while EELS can be used for up to 500 meV.&lt;ref name=Toennies/&gt;

During He scattering, the He atom does not actually penetrate into the material, being scattered only once at the surface; in EELS, the electron can go as deep as a few monolayers, scattering more than once during the course of the interaction.&lt;ref name=Toennies/&gt; Thus, the resulting data is easier to understand and analyze for He atom scattering than for EELS, since there are no multiple collisions to account for. 

He beams have a capabilities of delivering a beam of higher flux than electrons in EELS, but the detection of electrons is easier than the detection of He atoms. He scattering is also more sensitive to very low frequency vibrations, on the order of 1 meV.&lt;ref name=Toennies/&gt; This is the reason for its high resolution in comparison to EELS.

[[File:Woodgas Flame.jpg|thumb|[[Wood gas]], a type of syngas, burning]]
'''Syngas''', or '''synthesis gas''', is a [[fuel gas]] mixture consisting primarily of [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], and very often some [[carbon dioxide]]. The name comes from its use as [[Reaction intermediate|intermediate]]s in creating [[synthetic natural gas]] (SNG)&lt;ref name="Beychok"&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''Process and environmental technology for producing SNG and liquid fuels'', U.S. EPA report EPA-660/2-75-011, May 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and for producing [[ammonia]] or [[methanol]]. Syngas is usually a product of  [[gasification]] and the main application is [[electricity generation]]. Syngas is combustible and often used as a fuel of [[internal combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Syngas Cogeneration / Combined Heat &amp; Power|website=[[Clarke Energy]]|url=http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/synthesis-gas-syngas/|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why Let it go to Waste?

Syngas can be produced from many sources, including natural gas, coal, biomass, or virtually any hydrocarbon feedstock, by reaction with steam ([[steam reforming]]), carbon dioxide ([[dry reforming]]) or oxygen ([[partial oxidation]]). Syngas is a crucial intermediate resource for production of hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Syngas is also used as an intermediate in producing  [[synfuel|synthetic petroleum]] for use as a [[fuel]] or [[lubricant]] via the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] and previously the [[Mobil]] [[Gas to liquids#Methanol to Gasoline process (MTG)|methanol to gasoline]] process.

Production methods include [[steam reforming]] of natural gas or liquid hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen, the [[gasification]] of coal,&lt;ref&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''Coal gasification and the Phenosolvan process'', American Chemical Society 168th National Meeting, Atlantic City, September 1974&lt;/ref&gt; [[biomass]], and in some types of [[waste-to-energy]] gasification facilities.

==Production==
The chemical composition of syngas varies based on the raw materials and the processes. Syngas produced by coal gasification generally is a mixture of 30 to 60% carbon monoxide, 25 to 30% hydrogen, 5 to 15% carbon dioxide, and 0 to 5% methane. It also contains lesser amount of other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syngas composition|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/syngas-composition|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main reaction that produces syngas, [[steam reforming]], is an [[endothermic reaction]] with 206 kJ/mol methane needed for conversion.

The first reaction, between incandescent coke and steam, is strongly endothermic, producing carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen {{chem|H|2}} ([[water gas]] in older terminology). When the coke bed has cooled to a temperature at which the endothermic reaction can no longer proceed, the steam is then replaced by a blast of air.

The second and third reactions then take place, producing an [[exothermic reaction]]—forming initially carbon dioxide and raising the temperature of the coke bed—followed by the second endothermic reaction, in which the latter is converted to carbon monoxide, CO. The overall reaction is exothermic, forming "producer gas" (older terminology). Steam can then be re-injected, then air etc., to give an endless series of cycles until the coke is finally consumed.  Producer gas has a much lower energy value, relative to water gas, due primarily to dilution with atmospheric nitrogen.  Pure oxygen can be substituted for air to avoid the dilution effect, producing gas of much higher calorific value.
  
When used as an intermediate in the large-scale, industrial synthesis of hydrogen (principally used in the production of [[ammonia]]), it is also produced from [[natural gas]] (via the steam reforming reaction) as follows:

:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 + H2O -&gt; CO + 3H2&lt;/chem&gt;

In order to produce more hydrogen from this mixture, more steam is added and the [[Water-gas shift reaction|water gas shift]] reaction is carried out:

:&lt;chem&gt;CO + H2O -&gt; CO2 + H2&lt;/chem&gt;

The hydrogen must be separated from the {{CO2}} to be able to use it. This is primarily done by [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA), [[amine scrubbing]], and [[membrane reactor]]s.

==Alternative technologies==

===Biomass catalytic partial oxidation===

Conversion of biomass to syngas is typically low-yield. The University of Minnesota developed a metal catalyst that reduces the biomass reaction time by up to a factor of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syngas Production Using a Biomass Gasification Process|url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Syngas-from-Renewable-Hydrogen-and-Carbon-Monoxide-Gases-Using-a-Biomass-Gasification-Process__Z07080.aspx|publisher=[[University of Minnesota]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalyst can be operated at atmospheric pressure and reduces char. The entire process is autothermic and therefore heating is not required.

===Carbon dioxide and hydrogen===

====Microwave energy====

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be split into CO and then combined with hydrogen to form syngas [http://cambridgenanosystems.com/]. A method for production of carbon monoxide from carbon dioxide by treating it with microwave radiation is being examined by the solar fuels-project of the [[Dutch Institute For Fundamental Energy Research]]. This technique was alleged to have been used during the Cold war in Russian nuclear submarines to allow them to get rid of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas without leaving a bubble trail.&lt;ref&gt;NWT magazine 6/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Publicly available journals published during the Cold War indicate that American submarines used conventional chemical [[scrubber]]s to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=R.|last2=Gomezplata|first2=A.|last3=Sarich|first3=A.|title=An overview into submarine CO2 scrubber development|journal=Ocean Engineering|date=January 1983|volume=10|issue=4|pages=227–233|doi=10.1016/0029-8018(83)90010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documents released after the sinking of the [[Kursk submarine disaster|Kursk]], a Cold War era [[Oscar-class submarine]], indicate that [[potassium superoxide]] scrubbers were used to remove carbon dioxide on that vessel.

====Solar energy====
Heat generated by [[concentrated solar power]] may be used to drive thermochemical reactions to split carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide or to make hydrogen.&lt;ref name="Sunshine to Petrol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunshine to Petrol|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/wp/wp-content/gallery/uploads/S2P_SAND2009-5796P.pdf|publisher=Sandia National Laboratories|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural gas]] may be used as a feedstock in a facility that integrates concentrated solar power with a power plant fueled by natural gas augmented by syngas while the sun is shining.&lt;ref name=SunShot&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Solar Thermochemical Reaction System|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/sunshot/csp_sunshotrnd_pnnl.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT41013&gt;{{cite news|title=New Solar Process Gets More Out of Natural Gas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/business/energy-environment/new-solar-process-gets-more-out-of-natural-gas.html|accessdate=April 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 10, 2013|author=Matthew L.

It is called the Counter-Rotating Ring Receiver Reactor Recuperator, or [[Counter-Rotating Ring Receiver Reactor Recuperator|CR5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Energetic aspects of the syngas production by solar energy: Reforming of methane and carbon gasification|first=L.|last=D'Alessio|first2=M.|last2=Paolucci|journal=[[Solar &amp; Wind Technology]]|volume=6|number=2|year=1989|pages=101–104|doi=10.1016/0741-983X(89)90018-0|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0741983X89900180|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Creating fuel from sunlight|date=23 October 2013|website=[[University of Minnesota]]|url=http://www1.umn.edu/news/features/2011/UR_CONTENT_290042.html|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/mission/ste/stories/2008/August/Millerfinal.pdf|title=Sunshine-to-Petrol project reference 1|author=|date=|website=sandia.gov|accessdate=7 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920234449/http://www.sandia.gov/mission/ste/stories/2008/August/Millerfinal.pdf|archivedate=20 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/wp/wp-content/gallery/uploads/S2P_SAND2009-5796P.pdf|title=Sunshine-to-Petrol project reference 2|author=|date=|website=sandia.gov|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind energy====
An airborne wind energy system has been proposed to supply heat to the steam reforming reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond electricity generation: airborne wind energy system for synthetic fuel production and energy storage|url=http://www.awelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/AWEC2013-Presentation-Airborne-Wind-Energy-for-Storage-and-Synthetic-Fuels.pptx|publisher=Presentation at Airborne Wind Energy Conference, 2013|author=L. Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids burning natural gas for the heat and radically simplifies the steam reformer.

====Co-electrolysis====
By employing co-electrolysis, i.e. the electrochemical conversion of steam and carbon dioxide with the use of renewably generated electricity, syngas can be produced in the framework of a {{CO2}}-valorization scenario, allowing for a closed carbon cycle.&lt;ref&gt;"Power-to-Syngas - an enabling technology for the transition of the energy system? Production of tailored synfuels and chemicals using renewably generated electricity". S. Foit, I.C. Vince, L.G.J. de Haart, R.-A. Eichel, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. (2016) http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201607552/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity==
Use of electricity to extract carbon dioxide from water&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA544002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA539765&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA589263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA565466&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA544072&lt;/ref&gt; and then water gas shift to syngas has been trialled by the US Naval Research Lab. This process becomes cost effective if the price of electricity is below $20/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/508051/a-cheap-trick-enables-energy-efficient-carbon-capture/|title=A Cheap Trick Enables Energy-Efficient Carbon Capture|first=Prachi|last=Patel|date=|website=technologyreview.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewable sources===
Electricity generated from [[renewable energy|renewable sources]] is also used to process carbon dioxide and water into syngas through the [[high-temperature electrolysis]]. This is an attempt to maintain [[carbon neutral]] in the generation process. [[Audi]], in partnership with company named Sunfire, opened a pilot plant in November 2014 to generate [[e-diesel]] using this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audi in new e-fuels project: synthetic diesel from water, air-captured CO2 and green electricity; "Blue Crude"|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/11/20141114-audibluecrude.html|accessdate=29 April 2015|work=Green Car Congress.|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

=== Gas lighting ===
[[Coal gasification]] processes to create syngas were used for many years to manufacture [[History of manufactured gas|illuminating gas]] ([[coal gas]]) for [[gas lighting]], cooking and to some extent, heating, before [[electric light]]ing and the [[natural gas]] infrastructure became widely available.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The syngas produced in waste-to-energy gasification facilities can be used to generate electricity.

=== Energy capacity ===
Syngas that is not methanized typically has a lower heating value of 120 BTU/[[Standard cubic foot|scf]] .&lt;ref name="synheat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.205.6065&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=FUNDAMENTAL IMPACT OF FIRING SYNGAS IN GAS TURBINES|last=|author=Emmanuel O. Oluyede|first=|authorlink=|date=|year=|work=|publisher=Clemson/EPRI|accessdate=2016-06-13|coauthors=|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Untreated syngas can be run in hybrid turbines that allow for greater efficiency because of their lower operating temperatures, and extended part lifetime.&lt;ref name="synheat" /&gt;

=== Sponge iron ===
Syngas is used to directly reduce [[iron ore]] to [[Direct reduced iron|sponge iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=afWFqsatBrQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=syngas+iron+smelting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOwbHX_t_dAhWEZlAKHTa_ASAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=SPONGE IRON PRODUCTION BY DIRECT REDUCTION OF IRON OXIDE|last=CHATTERJEE|first=AMIT|date=2012-09-12|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120346598|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diesel ===
Syngas can be used in the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] to produce diesel, or converted into e.g. [[methane]], [[methanol]], and [[dimethyl ether]] in [[catalytic]] processes.

If the syngas is post-treated by cryogenic processing, it should be taken into account that this technology has great difficulty in recovering pure [[carbon monoxide]] if relatively large volumes of [[nitrogen]] are present due to [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrogen]] having very similar boiling points which are –191.5&amp;nbsp;°C and –195.79&amp;nbsp;°C respectively. Certain process technology selectively removes [[carbon monoxide]] by [[complexation]]/[[decomplexation]] of [[carbon monoxide]] with cuprous aluminum chloride ({{chem|Cu|Al|Cl|4}}) dissolved in an organic liquid such as [[toluene]]. The purified [[carbon monoxide]] can have a purity greater than 99%, which makes it a good feedstock for the chemical industry. The reject gas from the system can contain [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen]], [[methane]], [[ethane]], and [[hydrogen]].  The reject gas can be further processed on a [[pressure swing adsorption]] system to remove [[hydrogen]], and the hydrogen and [[carbon monoxide]] can be recombined in the proper ratio for catalytic methanol production, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, etc. Cryogenic purification, being very energy-intensive, is not well suited to simply making fuel, because of the greatly reduced [[net energy gain]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

=== Methanol ===
Syngas is used to produce [[methanol]] as in the following reaction.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;chem&gt; CO_2 + 3 H2 -&gt;CH3OH + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hydrogen ===
Syngas is used to produce [[hydrogen]] for the [[Haber process]].

'''''The Fruit Hunters''''' is a 2012 feature documentary film about exotic fruit cultivators and preservationists. It is directed by [[Yung Chang]] and co-written by Chang and [[Mark Slutsky]], and inspired by [[Adam Leith Gollner]]’s 2008 book of the same name.&lt;ref name="Barna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/11/30/the-canadian-climate-bad-for-fruit-good-for-documentaries/|title=The Canadian climate: bad for fruit, good for documentaries|last=Barna|first=Daniel|date=30 November 2012|work=[[Maclean's]]|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://thetyee.ca/ArtsAndCulture/2012/12/07/Fruit-Hunters/|title='The Fruit Hunters'|last=Burgess|first=Steve|date=7 December 2012|work=[[The Tyee]]|accessdate=10 December 2012|location=Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to documentary sequences, the film also uses CGI animation, models and performers to stage real and imagined moments in the history of fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article-852791/vancouver/fruit-hunters-makes-juicy-case-against-monoculture|title=The Fruit Hunters makes a juicy case against monoculture|last=Eisner|first=Ken|date=6 December 2012|work=[[Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=10 December 2012|location=Vancouver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film subjects==
Subjects in the film include actor [[Bill Pullman]], who was not featured in Gollner's book. The filmmakers became aware of his interest in fruit thanks to a 2009 ''[[New York Times]]'' profile. The film follows Pullman's efforts to develop a communal orchard near his Hollywood Hills residence.&lt;ref name="Barna"/&gt;

Two staff members of [[Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden]] are shown exploring jungles in Asia and South America in search of plants to graft and preserve.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

''The Fruit Hunters'' also features a Honduran scientist trying to find an alternative to the [[Cavendish banana]], an Italian cultivator who studies Renaissance paintings to identify new varieties, and an indigenous guide in Borneo.&lt;ref name="Barna"/&gt;

==Development and production==
The idea for ''The Fruit Hunters'' was first pitched at a forum at [[Hot Docs]], utilizing footage with Bill Pullman. The [[National Film Board of Canada]] and [[EyeSteelFilm]] agreed to co-produce the film, which also has funding from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], [[Telefilm Canada]] and [[SODEC]].&lt;ref name="Barna"/&gt;

Chang, Slutsky and Gollner were friends before working on the film, having once lived in the same building in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://povmagazine.com/blog/view/photos-the-fruit-hunters-at-the-bloor|title=The Fruit Hunters at the Bloor|date=26 November 2012|work=Point of View|publisher=[[Documentary Organization of Canada]]|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''London Accord''' is a collaboration between [[investment banks]], research houses, academics and [[NGOs]] to produce free research on [[climate change]] for financial investors.

It is intended as a reference guide for investors in the climate change sector.

The London Accord is the largest cooperative project in the world on investment opportunities in [[climate change mitigation|avoiding climate change]] (about 7 million UK pounds).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.excelconferences.com/7.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511193057/http://www.excelconferences.com/7.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The London Accord began in 2005, was launched formally in March 2007 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/media_centre/files2007/City+launches+pioneering+London+Accord+project.htm City of London Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and published its first results on 19 December 2007 launching them at a roll out meeting at [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] in London.  These findings are freely available from its website.

Its main summary of December 2007 said:

*The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] shows that the world needs to act to [[avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid disastrous climate change]], and act now.
*The [[Stern Report]] shows that the overall cost of strong early action is much less than the cost of inaction.
*The [[International Energy Agency]] shows the changes in fuel mix and energy usage that are necessary to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations at a safe level.
*The [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] shows how much money is required by region and by technology to realise a scenario that achieves stabilisation.
*The UNFCCC report shows further that 86% of that investment has to come from the private sector. That equates to private sector investment through 2030 in excess of $600bn per year.
*The London Accord report shows investors and policy makers by technology how attractive that private investment is, at the end of 2007.

==Findings==
The findings of the research carried out show that:
*energy investment is going to become much, much riskier
*key governmental focus should be on establishing [[cap-and-trade]] markets, then international carbon standards, then regulation; not taxation
*[[forestry]] is a big unknown – governments should fund research into the real extent of abatement potential and the real costs of forestation
*[[carbon capture]] and sequestration/storage (CCS) seems an unrealistic investment

Since 2007 the London Accord has become one of the leading sources for policy-makers of investment research on environmental, social and governance issues.  By the end of 2011, over 250 research reports had been released to the public.  Funding for the London Accord has come from the [[City of London Corporation]], Z/Yen Group and [[Gresham College]].

==Quotes about the London Accord==
[[David Lewis (Lord Mayor)]] said:
{{cquote|Climate change represents an unparalleled threat to our life on the planet and through the London Accord, the City's best brains have cooperated in an unprecedented way to tackle the challenge.

The London Accord is the first open-source, co-operative investment analysis into opportunities and challenges in the energy supply and climate change market - which needs to be $600bn a year invested from the private sector over the next 25 years.

Climate change can be tackled if the investment is there - and the London Accord is the first comprehensive map for the investment community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=13899&amp;channel=0 $600bn will tackle climate change&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Thermal cutoff.jpg|thumb|An assortment of thermal fuses]]
A '''thermal cutoff''' is an [[Electricity|electrical]] [[safety]] device that interrupts [[electric current]] when [[heat]]ed to a specific [[temperature]]. These devices may be for one-time use or may be reset manually or automatically.

==Thermal fuse==
[[File:Thermal-Fuse-CJC01.png|thumb|right| A thermal fuse protecting the windings of a small motor]]
A '''thermal fuse''' is a cutoff which uses a one-time [[fusible link]]. Unlike a thermal switch which may automatically reset itself when the temperature drops, the thermal fuse is more like an [[Fuse (electrical)|electrical fuse]]: a single-use device that cannot be reset and must be replaced when it fails or is triggered. A thermal fuse is used when the overheating is a result of a rare occurrence, such as failure requiring [[repair]] (which would also replace the fuse) or replacement at the end of [[service life]]. &lt;ref&gt;Joe Cieszynski, David Fox, ''Electronics for Service Engineers'',Routledge, 1999 {{ISBN|0750634766}}, p.175 &lt;/ref&gt;

One mechanism is a small meltable pellet that holds down a spring. When the pellet melts, the spring is released, separating the contacts and breaking the circuit. The Tamura LE series, NEC Sefuse SF series, Microtemp G4A series, and Hosho Elmwood D series, for example, may use alloy pellets that contain [[copper]], [[beryllium]], and [[silver]] to melt at a precise temperature.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

Thermal fuses are usually found in heat-producing electrical [[small appliance|appliance]]s such as [[coffeemaker]]s and [[hair dryer]]s. They function as safety devices to disconnect the current to the [[heating element]] in case of a malfunction (such as a defective thermostat) that would otherwise allow the temperature to rise to dangerous levels, possibly starting a [[fire]]. 

Unlike electrical fuses or [[circuit breaker]]s, thermal fuses only react to excessive temperature and not to excessive current (unless the excessive current is sufficient to cause the thermal fuse itself to heat up to the trigger temperature). For example, in a [[surge protector]] thermal fuses may be wired in series with the [[varistors]]; when the varistors conduct, the fuse heats up and disconnects the power, which eliminates the risk of fire which can occur when the varistors are overloaded.

==Thermal switch==
[[File:Thermal switches.jpg|thumb|Two thermal switches]]
[[File:Thermo relay 1-pole.JPG|thumb|Schematic symbol for a thermal overload switch]]
A '''thermal switch''' (sometimes '''thermal reset''' or '''thermal cutout''' (TCO)) is a device which normally opens at a high temperature (often with a faint "plink" sound) and re-closes when the temperature drops. The thermal switch may be a [[bimetallic strip]], often encased in a tubular glass bulb to protect it from [[dust]] or [[short circuit]]. Another common design uses a bimetallic shallow dome-shaped cap which "clicks" to an inside-out inverted cap shape when heated, such as the "Klixon" brand of thermal cutouts. &lt;ref&gt;Alan R. Earls, Robert E. Edwards, ''Raytheon Company: The First Sixty Years''Arcadia Publishing, 2005
{{ISBN|0738537470}}, page 9 &lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a thermal fuse, a thermal switch is usually reusable, and is therefore suited to protecting against temporary situations which are common and user-correctable. Thermal switches are used in [[power supplies]] in case of [[Electrical overload|overload]], and also as [[thermostats]] in some heating and cooling systems.

Another type of thermal switch is a PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) [[thermistor]]; these thermistors have a "switch" temperature at which the resistance suddenly rises rapidly, limiting the current through the circuit. When used in conjunction with a thermistor relay, the PTC will switch off an electrical system at a desired temperature. Typical use is for motor overheat protection.

Thermal switches are included in some [[light fixture]]s, particularly with [[recessed light]]s, where excessive heat is most likely to occur. This may lead to "cycling", where a light turns off and back on every few minutes. Flashing incandescent [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]] take advantage of this effect. Some flasher bulbs interrupt power when heated, while other twinkle/sparkle mini-bulbs momentarily [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] current around the [[Electrical filament|filament]]. 

Thermal switches are part of the normal operation of older [[fluorescent light]] fixtures, where they are the major part of the [[Glow switch starter|starter]] module.

[[General Electric|GE]] trademarked the name "Guardette" for the thermal protection switches used on their refrigeration compressors.

Thermal switches on [[microprocessor]]s often stop only the fetching of instructions to execute, reducing the [[clock rate]] to zero until a lower temperature is reached, while maintaining power to the [[CPU cache|cache]] to prevent data loss (although a second switch, with a higher triggering temperature, usually turns off even the cache and forces the computer to reboot). This mitigates the impact of programs resembling [[power virus]]es on the processor's longevity, while still accommodating their possible legitimate uses; it can also make [[overclocking]] possible with less risk.

===Manual reset===
Some thermal switches must be reset manually after they have been tripped. This design is used when an automatic and unattended restart would create a hazardous condition, such as sudden startup of a powerful motor without warning. These types of thermal cutouts are usually reset by pressing a [[push-button]] by hand or with a special tool.

In [[electronics]], a '''varicap diode''', '''varactor diode''', '''variable capacitance diode''', '''variable reactance diode''' or '''tuning diode''' is a type of [[diode]] designed to exploit the voltage-dependent [[capacitance]] of a reverse-biased [[p–n junction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sedra|first1=Adel|last2=Smith|first2=Kenneth|authorlink1=Adel Sedra|authorlink2=Kenneth C. Smith|title=Microelectronic circuits|date=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=9780195323030|page=214|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Varactors are used as voltage-controlled [[capacitors]]. They are commonly used in [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]s, [[parametric amplifier]]s, and [[frequency multiplier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Calvert|first1=James|title=Varactors|url=http://mysite.du.edu/~etuttle/electron/elect40.htm|website=Dr Tuttle's Home Page|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=English|date=15 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Voltage-controlled oscillators have many applications such as [[frequency modulation]] for FM transmitters and [[phase-locked loop]]s. Phase-locked loops are used for the [[frequency synthesizer]]s that tune many radios, [[television set]]s, and [[cellular telephone]]s.

The varicap was developed by the Pacific Semiconductor subsidiary of the Ramo Wooldridge Corporation who received a patent for the device in June 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor1-last=Barnes |inventor1-first=Sanford H. |inventor2-last=Mann |assign=Pacific Semiconductors, Inc. |inventor2-first=John E. |title=Voltage sensitive semiconductor capacitor |country-code=US |patent-number=2989671 |publication-date=23 May 1958 |issue-date=20 June 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device name was also trademarked as the "Varicap" by TRW Semiconductors, the successor to Pacific Semiconductors, in October 1967. This helps explain the different names for the device as it came into use.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}}

== Operation ==
[[File:Varactor function.svg|right|thumb|Operation of a varicap. [[Electron hole|Holes]] are blue, electrons are red, [[depletion zone]] is white. The electrodes are at the top and bottom.]]
Varactors are operated in a [[reverse-biased]] state, so no DC current flows through the device.  The amount of reverse bias controls the thickness of the [[depletion zone]] and therefore the varactor's junction capacitance. Generally, the depletion region thickness is proportional to the [[square root]] of the applied voltage, and [[capacitance]] is inversely proportional to the depletion region thickness. Thus, the capacitance is inversely proportional to the square root of applied voltage.

All diodes exhibit this variable junction capacitance, but varactors are manufactured to exploit the effect and increase the capacitance variation.

The figure shows an example of a cross section of a varactor with the depletion layer formed of a p–n junction. This depletion layer can also be made of a [[MOSFET|MOS]] or a [[Schottky diode|Schottky]] diode. This is important in [[CMOS]] and [[MMIC]] technology.

==Use in a circuit==
===Tuning circuits===
Generally the use of a varicap diode in a circuit requires connecting it to a [[tuned circuit]], usually in parallel with any existing capacitance or inductance.&lt;ref&gt;Varactor Circuits http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/semicond/varactor-varicap-diodes/circuits.php&lt;/ref&gt; A DC voltage is applied as reverse bias across the varicap to alter its capacitance.  The DC bias voltage must be blocked from entering the tuned circuit. This can be accomplished by placing a DC blocking capacitor with a capacitance about 100&amp;nbsp;times greater than the maximum capacitance of the varicap diode in series with it and by applying DC from a high impedance source to the node between the varicap cathode and the blocking capacitor as shown in the upper left circuit in the accompanying diagram.

[[File:Varicap Ccts.jpg|right|500px|Example circuits using varicaps]]
Since no significant DC current flows in the varicap, the value of the resistor connecting its cathode back to the DC control voltage can be somewhere in the range of 22&amp;nbsp;kΩ to 150&amp;nbsp;kΩ and the blocking capacitor somewhere in the range of 5&amp;ndash;100&amp;nbsp;nF. Sometimes, with very high-Q tuned circuits, an inductor is placed in series with the resistor to increase the source impedance of the control voltage so as not to load the tuned circuit and decrease its Q.

Another common configuration uses two back-to-back (anode to anode) varicap diodes. (See lower left circuit in diagram.) The second varicap effectively replaces the blocking capacitor in the first circuit. This reduces the overall capacitance and the capacitance range by half, but has the advantage of reducing the AC component of voltage across each device and has symmetrical distortion should the AC component possess enough amplitude to bias the varicaps into forward conduction.

When designing tuning circuits with varicaps it is usually good practice to maintain the AC component of voltage across the varicap at a minimal level, usually less than 100&amp;nbsp;mV peak to peak, to prevent changing the diode capacitance too much, which would distort the signal and add harmonics.

A third circuit, at top right in diagram, uses two series-connected varicaps and separate DC and AC signal ground connections. The DC ground is shown as a traditional ground symbol, and the AC ground as an open triangle. Separation of grounds is often done to (i) prevent high-frequency radiation from the low-frequency ground node, and (ii) prevent DC currents in the AC ground node changing bias and operating points of active devices such as varicaps and transistors.

These circuit configurations are quite common in television tuners and electronically tuned broadcast AM and FM receivers, as well as other communications equipment and industrial equipment. Early varicap diodes usually required a reverse voltage range of 0&amp;ndash;33 v to obtain their full capacitance ranges, which were still quite small, approximately 1&amp;ndash;10 pF. These types were – and still are – extensively used in television tuners, whose high carrier frequencies require only small changes in capacitance.

In time, varicap diodes were developed which exhibited large capacitance ranges, 100&amp;ndash;500&amp;nbsp;pF, with relatively small changes in reverse bias: 0&amp;ndash;5&amp;nbsp;V or 0&amp;ndash;12&amp;nbsp;V. These newer devices allow electronically tuned AM broadcast receivers to be realized as well as a multitude of other functions requiring large capacitance changes at lower frequencies, generally below 10&amp;nbsp;MHz. Some designs of electronic security tag readers used in retail outlets require these high capacitance varicaps in their voltage-controlled oscillators.

[[File:TVTunerM 01.jpg|thumb|Australian market band I-III-U television tuner with varicaps highlighted]]
[[File:AMFMM 01.jpg|thumb|Consumer AM-FM broadcast tuner with varicaps highlighted]]
The three leaded devices depicted at the top of the page are generally two common cathode connected varicaps in a single package. In the consumer AM/FM tuner depicted at the right, a single dual-package varicap diode adjusts both the passband of the tank circuit (the main station selector), and the [[local oscillator]] with a single varicap for each. This is done to keep costs down &amp;ndash; two dual packages could have been used, one for the tank and one for the oscillator, four diodes in all, and this is what was depicted in the application data for the LA1851N AM radio chip. Two lower-capacitance dual varactors used in the FM section (which operates at a frequency about one hundred times greater) are highlighted by red arrows. In this case four diodes are used, via a dual package for the tank / bandpass filter and a dual package for  the local oscillator.

===Switching===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
&lt;!-- usually, RF switching is done with a PIN diode. The capacitive switching explanation requires a large cap change -- and it would have poor isolation and limited signal amplitude. --&gt;

Special types of varicap diode exhibiting an abrupt change in capacitance can often be found in consumer equipment such as television tuners, which are used to switch radio frequency signal paths. When in the high capacitance state, usually with low or no bias, they present a low impedance path to RF, whereas when reverse biased their capacitance abruptly decreases and their RF impedance increases. Although they are still slightly conductive to the RF path, the attenuation they introduce decreases the unwanted signal to an acceptably low level. They are often used in pairs to switch between two different RF sources such as the VHF and UHF bands in a television tuner by supplying them with complementary bias voltages.

==Harmonic multiplication==
In some applications, such as [[Frequency multiplier#Varactor diode|harmonic multiplication]], a large signal amplitude alternating voltage is applied across a varicap to deliberately vary the capacitance at signal rate to generate higher harmonics, which are extracted through filtering.  If a sine wave current of sufficient amplitude is applied driven through a varicap, the resultant voltage gets "peaked" into a more triangular shape, and odd harmonics are generated.

This was one early method used to generate microwave frequencies of moderate power, 1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;GHz at 1&amp;ndash;5 watts, from about 20 watts at a frequency of 3&amp;ndash;400&amp;nbsp;MHz before adequate transistors had been developed to operate at this higher frequency. This technique is still used to generate much higher frequencies, in the 100&amp;nbsp;GHz &amp;ndash; 1&amp;nbsp;THz range, where even the fastest GaAs transistors are still inadequate.

==Substitutes for varicap diodes==
All semiconductor junction devices exhibit the effect, so they can be used as varicaps, but their characteristics will not be controlled and can vary widely between batches.

Popular makeshift varicaps include LEDs,&lt;ref&gt;LEDs as Varicaps http://www.hanssummers.com/varicap/varicapled.html&lt;/ref&gt; 1N400X series rectifier diodes,&lt;ref&gt;Rectifier Diodes As Varicaps http://www.hanssummers.com/varicap/varicapdiode.html&lt;/ref&gt; Schottky rectifiers and various transistors used with their collector-base junctions reverse biased,&lt;ref name="Hood1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Linsley Hood|title=The Art of Linear Electronics|year=1993|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4831-0516-1|pages=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the [[2N2222]] and [[BC548|BC547]].{{clarify|reason=are these just examples of transistors or of transistors especially good in this role (the latter case would require citation)|date=January 2015}} Reverse biasing the emitter-base junctions of transistors also is quite effective as long as the AC amplitude remains small. Maximum reverse bias voltage is usually between 5 and 7 Volts, before the avalanche process starts conducting. Higher-current devices with greater junction area tend to possess higher capacitance. The Philips BA&amp;nbsp;102 varicap and a common zener diode, the [[1N5408]], exhibit similar changes in junction capacitance, with the exception that the BA&amp;nbsp;102 possesses a ''specified'' set of characteristics in relation to junction capacitance (whereas the 1N5408 does not) and the [[Q factor|"Q"]] of the 1N5408 is less.

Before the development of the varicap, motor driven [[variable capacitor]]s or [[Saturable reactor|saturable-core reactors]] were used as electrically controllable reactances in the VCOs and filters of equipment like World War&amp;nbsp;II German [[spectrum analyzer]]s.
