The '''Aarhus School of Architecture''' (Arkitektskolen Aarhus) was founded in 1965 in [[Aarhus]], Denmark. Along with the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]], School of Architecture in [[Copenhagen]], it is responsible for the education of [[architect]]s in Denmark. The school has approximately 750 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Arkitekturinstitutioner/Arkitektskolen_Aarhus |title=Arkitektskolen Aarhus |publisher=Gyldendal |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907084959/http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Arkitekturinstitutioner/Arkitektskolen_Aarhus |archivedate=7 September 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational structure and content ==
Teaching at the Aarhus School of Architecture is studio-based, emphasising group work and project work. The school places an emphasis on practice-based teaching, while maintaining an artistic approach to architecture. Teaching is organised around a number of research labs, based on on-going and close dialogue with teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aarch.dk/info/organisation/staff-2/platforms/ |title=Discipline-specific platforms |publisher=Aarhus School of Architecture |accessdate=5 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095455/http://aarch.dk/info/organisation/staff-2/platforms/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Workshop facilities allow students to explore their ideas in 3D and in 1:1. Other resources include a specialised library, a materials shop and a [http://aarch.dk/info/school-web/fabrication-labs/robot-lab/ robot lab].

In 2016 the school's research was restructured as three [http://aarch.dk/info/research/about-research/research-labs/ research labs]:

Research Lab 1: Territories, Architecture, and Transformation

Research Lab 2: Technology and Building Cultures

Research Lab 3: Emerging Architecture

Research is carried out within the school’s three focus areas: habitation, transformation, and sustainability – as well as in the field of research by design.

Besides Bachelor’s, Master’s and PhD programmes the school offers supplementary education for architects and similar professional groups at various levels. Research at the school is also to a high degree practice-based, i.e. based on cooperation with architectural practices located internationally and locally. The high concentration of architectural practices in Aarhus provides a sound basis for this cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Arkitekturklyngen i Århus, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aarhus School of Architecture is an educational institution under the [http://en.fivu.dk/ Danish Ministry for Science, Innovation and Higher Education].

== School buildings ==
The school is situated in the [[Nørre Stenbro]] neighborhood on ''Nørreport''. The campus comprises the [[Listed buildings in Aarhus Municipality|listed building]] known as Raae's House ({{lang-da|Raaes Gård}}) from 1798 and a newer building from 1997 with [[auditorium]] and an exhibition hall.&lt;ref name="Ark" /&gt;

Raae's House is a brick building in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]] built by Hans Fridrich Raae, one of the foremost merchants in the city during the 18th century.&lt;ref name="StatArk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/N%C3%B8rreport_20 |title=Nørreport 20 |publisher=Aarhus State Archives |language=Danish |accessdate=6 February 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6f6rxg9Q1?url=http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/N%C3%B8rreport_20 |archive-date=7 February 2016 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally built on the northern edge of the city by the city walls on what was at the time [[Studsgade]]. It is one of the best examples of Neoclassical architecture in Aarhus and one of the last remaining brick built merchant's houses of that time. The building is in 4 wings with a [[courtyard]] in the middle but only the house facing the street is constructed in brick with the remaining being [[half-timbered]] structures with [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] elements. The building was listed in 1919.&lt;ref name="Kult"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/fbb/sagvis.pub?sag=1097021 |title=Raaes Gård |publisher=[[Danish Heritage Agency]] |language=Danish |accessdate=6 February 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6f6rqcNwy?url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/fbb/sagvis.pub?sag=1097021 |archive-date=7 February 2016 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ark"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=3627 |title=Arkitektskolen (Raaes Gård), Aarhus |publisher=ArkArk |language=Danish |accessdate=6 February 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6f6s6fnA4?url=http://www.arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=3627 |archive-date=7 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GIS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/stenbro/side9.htm |title=REGISTRANT – Registrantområder – Nørre Stenbro og Skovvejskvarteret |publisher=[[Aarhus Municipality]] |language=Danish |accessdate=6 February 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6f6s8jBq7?url=http://gis.aarhus.dk/kommuneatlas/registranter/stenbro/side9.htm |archive-date=7 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the architects firm [[Kjaer &amp; Richter]] built an addition on an adjacent plot of land. It was designed in a modernistic style of concrete with glass facade. It is structured as a rectangular, black box with a dominating glass facade facing the street, intentionally contrasting the old building next to it. The design is modelled as a house-in-house with the auditorium appearing like an interior island that divides the building in an exhibition hall and [[foyer]].&lt;ref name="Ark" /&gt;

'''Andrew Jeremy Wakefield''' (born 1957)&lt;ref name=BBCProfile/&gt;&lt;ref name="ManBehind"/&gt; is a discredited former British doctor who became an [[anti-vaccine]] activist. He was a gastroenterologist until he was [[struck off]] the [[General Medical Council#Registering doctors in the UK|UK medical register]] for unethical behaviour, misconduct and fraud. In 1998 he authored a fraudulent research paper [[MMR vaccine controversy|claiming]] that there was a link between the [[MMR vaccine|measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine]] and [[autism]] and bowel disease.&lt;ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=retractions/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time_great_frauds/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcache.gmc-uk.org/gmclrmp_enu/start.swe?SWECmd=GotoView&amp;_sn=oMaMo82xkMABe6AKmG9oobxBnLdQIth.Z.UC7-MQtTKuOSPnh7SZ9nKRbX-VMjY3YuCuh0CeZEPUsx6N0bx9zl0HRaBNLllt3JgPihTu0XhFiO5txRcmBRXjWXNI5i73qKbtp1FOkVqZ05e16Rxtl8iA.hl-R6jKPm8iEPahyng-VDodvbRpDowR8jR.PE1w-S3X95vO-vg_&amp;SWEView=GMC+WEB+Doctor+Search&amp;SRN=&amp;SWEHo=webcache.gmc-uk.org&amp;SWETS=1401564587&amp;SWEApplet=GMC+WEB+Health+Provider+Search+Applet |title=GMC LRMP |format= |website= |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://briandeer.com/solved/gmc-charge-sheet.pdf |title=briandeer.com |format=pdf |website= |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims of measles virus–Crohn's disease link ===

Back in the UK, he worked on the liver transplant programme at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in London.&lt;ref name="ManBehind"/&gt; In 1993, Wakefield attracted professional attention when he published reports in which he concluded that measles virus might cause [[Crohn's disease]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wakefield AJ, Pittilo RM, Sim R |title=Evidence of persistent measles virus infection in Crohn's disease |journal=J.

Later, in 1995, while conducting research into Crohn's disease, he was approached by Rosemary Kessick, the parent of a child with autism, who was seeking help with her son's bowel problems and autism; Kessick ran a group called Allergy Induced Autism.&lt;ref name=Shot&gt;{{cite news | author = Langdon-Down, Grania | title = Law: A shot in the dark; The complications from vaccine damage seem to multiply in the courtroom | page = 25 |work=The Independent | date = 27 November 1996 | url = http://briandeer.com/wakefield/dawbarns-kessick.htm | publisher= Brian Deer | format = Reprint | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070810044020/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/dawbarns-kessick.htm| archivedate= 10 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Wakefield turned his attention to researching possible connections between the MMR vaccine and autism.&lt;ref name="ManBehind"/&gt;

He was reportedly asked to leave Royal Free Hospital after refusing a request to validate his 1998 ''Lancet'' paper with a controlled study.&lt;ref name=HowMakeMoney/&gt;

Wakefield subsequently helped establish and served as the executive director of [[Thoughtful House Center for Children]], which studies autism in [[Austin, Texas]], where, according to ''The Times'', he "continued to promote the theory of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, despite admitting it was 'not proved'."&lt;ref name=TimesProfile/&gt; He resigned from Thoughtful House in February 2010, after the British [[General Medical Council]] found that he had been "dishonest and irresponsible" in conducting his earlier autism research in England.&lt;ref name=RossStarFraudulent/&gt;&lt;ref name="thoughtful-house-resignation"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |title=British doctor resigns as head of Austin autism center |author=Roser, Mary Ann |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=1 April 2010 |url=http://www.statesman.com/news/local/british-doctor-resigns-as-head-of-austin-autism-251756.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312134206/http://www.statesman.com/news/local/british-doctor-resigns-as-head-of-austin-autism-251756.html |archivedate=12 March 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' reported in May 2010 that he was a medical advisor for Visceral, a UK charity that "researches bowel disease and developmental disorders".&lt;ref name=TimesProfile/&gt;

The authors noted that the parents of eight of the twelve children linked what were described as "behavioural symptoms" with MMR, and reported that the onset of these symptoms began within two weeks of MMR vaccination.&lt;ref name="WakefieldMMRPaper"/&gt; In the published ''Lancet'' summary, known as the "interpretation", the authors wrote:

{{bq|1=We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.&lt;ref name="WakefieldMMRPaper"/&gt;}}

These possible triggers were reported as MMR in eight cases, and measles infection in one. The paper was instantly controversial, leading to widespread publicity in the UK and the convening of a special panel of the UK's [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wakefield misled top UK medical research hearing over where he got MMR children (MRC documents) | author =Deer, Brian | date = 23 March 1998 | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/wakefield-mrc.htm | accessdate = 10 August 2007 |publisher=briandeer.com | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070810191050/http://briandeer.com/mmr/wakefield-mrc.htm| archivedate= 10 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One 2005 study done based in Japan found that there was no causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism in groups of children given the triple MMR vaccine and children who received individual measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations. In Japan, the MMR vaccine had been replaced with individual vaccinations in 1993.&lt;ref name="HondaMMRPaper"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Honda H, Shimizu Y, Rutter M |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=572–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15877763|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01425.x |title=No effect of MMR withdrawal on the incidence of autism: a total population study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the paper said that no causal connection had been proven, before it was published, Wakefield made statements at a press conference and in a video news release issued by the hospital, calling for suspension of the triple MMR vaccine until more research could be done.&lt;ref name=DeerInterview&gt;{{cite web | title = Interview: Dr Andrew Wakefield, research team leader, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine | author = Deer, Brian| date = 4 February 1998 | url = http://briandeer.com/wakefield/royal-video.htm | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711055354/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/royal-video.htm| archivedate= 11 July 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later criticized as '[[science by press conference]]'.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO Reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 | pmid = 17139292 | pmc = 1794697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to BBC News, it was this press conference, rather than the paper in ''The Lancet'', that fuelled the MMR vaccination scare.&lt;ref name=BBCMoral/&gt;  According to the BBC, he told journalists that "it was a 'moral issue' and he could no longer support the continued use of the three-in-one jab for measles, mumps and rubella. 'Urgent further research is needed to determine whether MMR may give rise to this complication in a small number of people,' Dr Wakefield said at the time."&lt;ref name=BBCMoral&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8481583.stm | date= 28 January 2010 |title= Wakefield and autism: the story that will not go away  |publisher=BBC News |author= Triggle, Nick |accessdate= 9 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110203172245/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8481583.stm| archivedate= 3 February 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "If you give three viruses together, three live viruses, then you potentially increase the risk of an adverse event occurring, particularly when one of those viruses influences the immune system in the way that measles does."&lt;ref name=DeerInterview/&gt; He suggested parents should opt for single vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella, separated by gaps of one year.  ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interviewed him in November 2000, and he repeated these claims to the U.S. audience, providing a new focus for the nascent anti-vaccination movement in the U.S., which had been primarily concerned about [[thiomersal]] in vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Offit|first1=PA|last2=Coffin|first2=SE|title=Communicating science to the public: MMR vaccine and autism.|journal=Vaccine|date=8 December 2003|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1586/14760584.2.1.1|pmid=14604564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chu|first1=Henry|title=British doctor rebuked over research linking vaccine and autism|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/29/world/la-fg-britain-autism29-2010jan29|work=Los Angeles Times|date=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--The controversy escalated as the UK government declined to introduce single-jab alternatives (which would have required licenced products to become available), based on the contention most closely associated with Dr David Salisbury, UK director of immunisation, that the risk of prolonging the period before children were immunised against all three diseases was greater than any credible risk of harm from combining them. Single vaccines, spaced a year apart, would expose children to greater risk of infection, as well as additional distress and expense. He stated that no evidence had been produced upon which to adopt such a policy.--&gt;
In December 2001, Wakefield resigned from the Royal Free Hospital, saying, "I have been asked to go because my research results are unpopular."&lt;ref name="unpopular"&gt;{{cite news|author=Fraser, Lorraine |title=Anti-MMR doctor is forced out |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1364080/Anti-MMR-doctor-is-forced-out.html |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=2 December 2001 |accessdate=29 March 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical school said that he had left "by mutual agreement". In February 2002, Wakefield stated, "What precipitated this crisis was the removal of the single vaccine, the removal of choice, and that is what has caused the furore—because the doctors, the gurus, are treating the public as though they are some kind of moronic mass who cannot make an informed decision for themselves."&lt;ref name=WhyIOwe&gt;{{cite news | author = Wakefield, Andrew | title = Why I owe it to parents to question triple vaccine | work = [[Sunday Herald]] | date = 10 February 2002 | url = http://www.sundayherald.com/22194 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030803151022/http://www.sundayherald.com/22194 | archivedate = 3 August 2003 | accessdate = 10 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath of initial controversy ===

Wakefield continued conducting clinical research in the United States after leaving the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in December 2001. He joined a controversial American researcher, [[Jeff Bradstreet]], at the International Child Development Resource Center, to conduct further studies on the possible relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-quack.htm |title=Brian Deer investigates MMR – Wakefield links |author=Deer, Brian |publisher=briandeer.com |accessdate=1 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505184934/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-quack.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Wakefield started work at the Thoughtful House research center in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article4837798.ece | title = MMR row doctor Andrew Wakefield spreads fear to US |work=The Times | location=London | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=25 April 2010 | author= Harlow, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield served as Executive Director of Thoughtful House until February 2010, when he resigned in the wake of findings against him by the British [[General Medical Council]].&lt;ref name="thoughtful-house-resignation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/19/wakefield-quits-texas-autism-centre | title = MMR vaccine doctor Andrew Wakefield quits autism centre |work=The Guardian | date = 19 February 2010 | location=London | author= Jones, Aidan | accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100407154235/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/feb/19/wakefield-quits-texas-autism-centre| archivedate= 7 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2004, the controversy resurfaced when Wakefield was accused of a conflict of interest. Brian Deer, writing in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]],'' reported that some of the parents of the 12 children in the study in ''The Lancet'' were recruited via a UK lawyer preparing a lawsuit against MMR manufacturers, and that the Royal Free Hospital had received £55,000 from the UK's Legal Aid Board (now the [[Legal Services Commission]]) to pay for the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Deer, Brian | title = Revealed: MMR Research Scandal |work=The Sunday Times| publisher= briandeer.com |date = 22 February 2004 | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-deer-1.htm | format = Reprint | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070808103704/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-deer-1.htm| archivedate= 8 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, in October 2003, the board had cut off public funding for the litigation against MMR manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Taxpayer cash for MMR action is stopped after £15m that stoked fear was spent | author = Deer, Brian | publisher= briandeer.com | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-lsc.htm | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070810191523/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-lsc.htm| archivedate= 10 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation of the allegations in ''The Sunday Times'' by the UK General Medical Council, Wakefield was charged with serious professional misconduct, including dishonesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Deer, Brian | title = MMR Scare Doctor Faces List of Charges |work=The Sunday Times |location= London | date = 11 September 2005 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article565188.ece | accessdate = 29 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, Deer, writing in the ''Sunday Times,'' further reported that in addition to the money they gave the Royal Free Hospital, the lawyers responsible for the MMR lawsuit had paid Wakefield personally more than £400,000, which he had not previously disclosed.&lt;ref name="MMRAidMoney"&gt;{{cite news | author = Deer, Brian | title = MMR doctor given legal aid thousands |work=The Times | date = 31 December 2006 | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-dec-2006.htm | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-four hours before the 2004 ''Sunday Times'' report by Deer, ''The Lancet's'' editor Richard Horton responded to the investigation in a public statement, describing Wakefield's research as "fatally flawed" and said he believed the paper would have been rejected as biased if the peer reviewers had been aware of Wakefield's conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="bbc-02-2004"&gt;{{cite news | title = Lead researcher defends MMR study |publisher=BBC News | date = 22 February 2004 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3510721.stm | accessdate = 10 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten of Wakefield's twelve co-authors of the paper in ''The Lancet''  later published a retraction of an interpretation:&lt;ref name=PMID15016483&gt;{{cite journal |author=Murch SH |title=Retraction of an interpretation |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |page=750 |year=2004 |pmid=15016483 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2 |author2=Anthony A |author3=Casson DH |last4=Malik |first4=Mohsin |last5=Berelowitz |first5=Mark |last6=Dhillon |first6=Amar P |last7=Thomson |first7=Michael A |last8=Valentine |first8=Alan |last9=Davies |first9=Susan E|display-authors=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The section of the paper retracted read as follows:

{{bq|1=Interpretation. We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.}}

The retraction stated:&lt;ref name=PMID15016483/&gt;

{{bq|1=We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between (the) vaccine and autism, as the data were insufficient. However the possibility of such a link was raised, and consequent events have had major implications for public health. In view of this, we consider now is the appropriate time that we should together formally retract the interpretation placed upon these findings in the paper, according to precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Ross, Emma | title = Scientists retract interpretation of research linking vaccine with autism | agency = Associated Press |publisher= briandeer.com | date = 3 March 2004 | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-retraction.htm | format = Reprint | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811220948/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-retraction.htm| archivedate= 11 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Wakefield v Channel 4 and others ===

In November 2004, [[Channel 4]] broadcast a one-hour ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' investigation by reporter [[Brian Deer]]; the ''Toronto Star'' said Deer had "produced documentary evidence that Wakefield applied for a patent on a single-jab measles vaccine before his campaign against the MMR vaccine, raising questions about his motives".&lt;ref name=RossStarFraudulent/&gt;&lt;ref name=patent&gt;{{cite web | title = Revealed: the first Wakefield MMR patent claim describes "safer measles vaccine" | author = Deer, Brian| url = http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm | publisher= briandeer.com | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070809105007/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm| archivedate= 9 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6534259.pdf|title=Regressive behavioral disorder diagnosis|website=www.freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Wakefield's unpublished initial patent submission,&lt;ref name=patent/&gt; Deer released a copy of the published patent application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UK Patent Application GB 2 325 856 A | url = http://briandeer.com/mmr/1998-vaccine-patent.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At page 1, the first paragraph of this stated:

{{bq|1=The present invention relates to a new vaccine/immunisation for the prevention and/or prophylaxis against measles virus infection and to a pharmaceutical or therapeutic composition for the treatment of IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease); particularly Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis and regressive behavioural disease (RBD) (also referred to as "Pervasive Developmental Disorder).}}

Before describing the research in Wakefield's 1998 paper in ''The Lancet'', at the same page this patent explicitly states that the use of the MMR vaccine causes autism:

{{bq|1=It has now also been shown that use of the MMR vaccine (which is taken to include live attenuated measles vaccine virus, measles virus, mumps vaccine virus and rubella vaccine virus, and wild strains of the aforementioned viruses) results in ileal lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, chronic colitis and pervasive developmental disorder including autism (RBD), in some infants.}}

According to Deer, a letter from Wakefield's lawyers to him dated 31 January 2005 said: "Dr Wakefield did not plan a rival vaccine."&lt;!-- See bottom of patent copy. --&gt;&lt;ref name=patent/&gt;

In the ''Dispatches'' programme, Deer also revealed that Nicholas Chadwick, a researcher working under Wakefield's supervision in the Royal Free medical school, had failed to find measles virus in the children reported on in ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deer|first=Brian| title = Molecular testing in Wakefield's own lab rebutted the basis for his attack on MMR | url = http://briandeer.com/wakefield/nick-chadwick.htm | publisher= briandeer.com | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070809174125/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/nick-chadwick.htm| archivedate= 9 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, Wakefield initiated libel proceedings against Channel&amp;nbsp;4, the independent production company [[Twenty Twenty]] and Brian Deer, ''The Sunday Times'', and against Deer personally along with his website briandeer.com.&lt;ref name="briandeer.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/ |title=Selected Investigations &amp; Journalism |publisher=Brian Deer |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks of issuing his claims, however, Wakefield sought to have the action frozen until after the conclusion of General Medical Council proceedings against him.  Channel&amp;nbsp;4 and Deer sought a High Court order compelling Wakefield to continue with his action, or discontinue it. After a hearing on 27 and 28 October 2005, Mr Justice [[David Eady]] ruled against a [[stay of proceedings]]:

{{bq|1=It thus appears that the Claimant wishes to use the existence of the libel proceedings for public relations purposes, and to deter other critics, while at the same time isolating himself from the "downside" of such litigation, in having to answer a substantial defence of justification ... I am quite satisfied, therefore, that the Claimant wished to extract whatever advantage he could from the existence of the proceedings while not wishing to progress them or to give the Defendants an opportunity of meeting the claims.&lt;ref name=Judgment&gt;{{cite web | title = Approved Judgment in the case of Andrew Wakefield vs. Channel Four Television Corporation, Twenty Twenty Productions Ltd., and Brian Deer | publisher = [[BAILII|British and Irish Legal Information Institute]] | date = 4 November 2005 | url = http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2005/2410.html | accessdate = 10 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The judgment identified Channel&amp;nbsp;4's "very lengthy extracts" summarizing Deer's allegations against Wakefield:&lt;ref name=Judgment/&gt;

:(i) [Wakefield] spread fear that the MMR vaccine might lead to autism, even though he knew that his own laboratory had carried out tests whose results dramatically contradicted his claims in that the measles virus had not been found in a single one of the children concerned in his study and he knew or ought to have known that there was absolutely no basis at all for his belief that the MMR should be broken up into single vaccines.

:(ii) In spreading such fear, acted dishonestly and for mercenary motives in that, although he improperly failed to disclose the fact, he planned a rival vaccine and products (such as a diagnostic kit based on his theory) that could have made his fortune

:(iii) Gravely abused the children under his care by unethically carrying out extensive invasive procedures (on occasions requiring three people to hold a child down), thereby driving nurses to leave and causing his medical colleagues serious concern and unhappiness

:(iv) Improperly and/or dishonestly failed to disclose to his colleagues and to the public that his research on autistic children had begun with a contract with solicitors who were trying to sue the manufacturers of the MMR vaccine

:(v) Improperly or dishonestly lent his reputation to the International Child Development Resource Centre, which promoted to very vulnerable parents expensive products for whose efficacy (as he knew or should have known) there was no scientific evidence

Mr. Justice Eady's ruling states that, "The views or conclusions of the GMC disciplinary body would not, so far as I can tell, be relevant or admissible", that Channel 4's allegations "go to undermine fundamentally the Claimant's professional integrity and honesty", and that, "It cannot seriously be suggested that priority should be given to GMC proceedings for the resolution of issues."

In December 2006, Deer released records obtained from the Legal Services Commission, showing that it had paid £435,643 in undisclosed fees to Wakefield for the purpose of building a case against the MMR vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Revealed: undisclosed payments to Andrew Wakefield at the heart of vaccine alarm | author = Deer, Brian| url = http://briandeer.com/wakefield/legal-aid.htm |publisher= briandeer.com | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070821211233/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/legal-aid.htm| archivedate= 21 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those payments, ''The Sunday Times'' reported, had begun two years before publication of Wakefield's paper in ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref name="MMRAidMoney"/&gt;  Within days of Deer's report, Wakefield dropped all his libel actions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://briandeer.com/wakefield/lawsuit-discontinues.htm |title = Wakefield drops libel claim over Channel 4 investigation, and agrees to pay costs |accessdate = 21 October 2009 |author= Deer, Brian |publisher= briandeer.com | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091114154127/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/lawsuit-discontinues.htm| archivedate= 14 November 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ordered to pay all defendants' legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/36663 |title=MMR Doc drops libel case versus Channel Four |work=Press Gazette |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524205844/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/36663 |archive-date=24 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ.com&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dyer C |title=Andrew Wakefield drops libel case against Channel 4 |journal=BMJ |volume=334 |issue=7584 |page=60 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17218681 |pmc=1767245 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39090.395509.DB }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other concerns ===

Wakefield's data were also questioned;&lt;ref name="truth"/&gt; a former graduate student, who appeared in Deer's programme, later testified that Wakefield ignored laboratory data that conflicted with his hypothesis.

In June 2005, the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' reported on an unnamed and unpublished study of blood samples from a group of 100 autistic children and 200 children without autism. They reported finding 99% of the samples contained no trace of the measles virus, and the samples that did contain the virus were just as likely to be from non-autistic children, i.e., only three samples contained the measles virus, one from an autistic child and two from a typically developing child. The study's authors found no evidence of any link between MMR and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Does the MMR Jab Cause Autism?

== General Medical Council hearings ==

Between July 2007 and May 2010, a 217-day "fitness to practise" hearing of the UK General Medical Council examined charges of [[Medical ethics|professional misconduct]] against Wakefield and two colleagues involved in the paper in ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref name=MMRScare&gt;{{cite news | title = MMR scare doctor 'paid children' |publisher=BBC News | date = 16 July 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6289166.stm | accessdate = 10 August 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070818102609/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6289166.stm| archivedate= 18 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | author = General Medical Council Press Office | title = Dr Andrew Wakefield, Professor John Walker-Smith, Professor Simon Murch: Fitness to Practise Hearings | publisher = General Medical Council press office | date = 8 October 2007 | url = http://www.gmcpressoffice.org.uk/apps/news/events/detail.php?key=1970 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071027142725/http://www.gmcpressoffice.org.uk/apps/news/events/detail.php?key=1970 | archivedate = 27 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges included that he:
* "Was being paid to conduct the study by solicitors representing parents who believed their children had been harmed by MMR".&lt;ref name=MMRScare/&gt;
* Ordered investigations "without the requisite paediatric qualifications" including [[colonoscopy|colonoscopies]], colon biopsies and [[lumbar puncture]]s ("spinal taps") on his research subjects without the approval of his department's [[institutional review board|ethics board]] and contrary to the children's clinical interests,&lt;ref name=MMRScare/&gt; when these diagnostic tests were not indicated by the children's symptoms or medical history.

Wakefield denied the charges;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7314144.stm|title=MMR doctor to begin his defence|date=27 March 2008|accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 28 January 2010, the GMC ruled against Wakefield on all issues, stating that he had "failed in his duties as a responsible consultant",&lt;ref name="YEP GMC result"/&gt; acted against the interests of his patients,&lt;ref name="YEP GMC result"/&gt; and "dishonestly and irresponsibly" in his controversial research.&lt;ref name="BBC GMC result"/&gt;  On 24 May 2010, he was struck off the United Kingdom medical register. It was the harshest sanction that the GMC could impose, and effectively ended his career as a physician. In announcing the ruling, the GMC said that Wakefield had "brought the medical profession into disrepute", and no sanction short of erasing his name from the register was appropriate for the "serious and wide-ranging findings" of misconduct.&lt;ref name=MeikleBoseley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8695267.stm |title=MMR doctor struck off register |author=Triggle, Nick |date=24 May 2010|publisher=[[BBC Online]] |accessdate=24 May 2010 |work=BBC News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100526020901/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8695267.stm| archivedate= 26 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Wakefield's autobiography, ''Callous Disregard'' was published, using the same words as one of the charges against him ("he showed callous disregard for any distress or pain the children might suffer").&lt;ref name=gmc-uk_Wakefield_SPM/&gt; Wakefield argued that he had been unfairly treated by the medical and scientific establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Callous Disregard |author=Wakefield, Andrew J | isbn=978-1-61608-169-0|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fraud and conflict of interest allegations ==

In February 2009, ''The Sunday Times'' reported that a further investigation by the newspaper had revealed that Wakefield "changed and misreported results in his research, creating the appearance of a possible link with autism",&lt;ref name=Deer2009&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece |title= MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism |author= Deer Brian|work=The Sunday Times |date=8 February 2009 |accessdate=9 February 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100525134829/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece| archivedate=25 May 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing evidence obtained by the newspaper from medical records and interviews with witnesses, and supported by evidence presented to the GMC.

In April 2010, Deer expanded on laboratory aspects of his findings in a report in the ''[[BMJ]]'', recounting how normal clinical [[histopathology]] results (obtained from the Royal Free hospital) had been subjected to wholesale changes, from normal to abnormal, in the medical school and published in ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deer B |title=Wakefield's "autistic enterocolitis" under the microscope |journal=BMJ |volume=340 |page= c1127|date= 15 April 2010 |pmid=20395277 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c1127 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c1127.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 January 2011, Deer provided two tables comparing the data on the twelve children, showing the original hospital data and the data with the wholesale changes as used in the 1998 ''The Lancet'' article.&lt;ref name=Deer_tables&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347#T1&lt;!--http://www.bmj.com/content/suppl/2011/01/05/bmj.c5347.DC1/deeb200710.ww1_default.pdf {{dead link|date=March 2012}}--&gt; "MMR &amp; Autism: Fixing a Link"],  Tables prepared by Brian Deer as a supplement to his peer reviewed report "How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed", published in the BMJ in January 2011 (BMJ 2011;342:c5347). [http://briandeer.com/solved/bmj-deer-mmr-tables.pdf alt source] ([https://www.webcitation.org/66XpKRNZu?url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347 archive (at anchor #T1)])&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2011, ''BMJ'' published an article by Brian Deer entitled "How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed".&lt;ref name=HowTheCase/&gt;  Deer, funded by ''The Sunday Times'' of London and Channel 4 television network, said that, based on examination of the medical records of the 12 children in the original study, his research had found:&lt;ref name=HowTheCase&gt;{{cite journal | title=How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed| author=Deer B| journal=BMJ |date= 5 January 2011 | volume=342 | pmid=21209059| pages=c5347| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The paper in ''The Lancet'' was a case series of 12 child patients; it reported a proposed "new syndrome" of enterocolitis and regressive autism and associated this with MMR as an "apparent precipitating event." But in fact:

: Three of nine children reported with regressive autism did not have autism diagnosed at all. Only one child clearly had regressive autism;

: Despite the paper claiming that all 12 children were "previously normal", five had documented pre-existing developmental concerns;

: Some children were reported to have experienced first behavioural symptoms within days of MMR, but the records documented these as starting some months after vaccination;

: In nine cases, unremarkable colonic histopathology results—noting no or minimal fluctuations in inflammatory cell populations—were changed after a medical school "research review" to "non-specific colitis";

: The parents of eight children were reported as blaming MMR, but 11 families made this allegation at the hospital. The exclusion of three allegations—all giving times to onset of problems in months—helped to create the appearance of a 14 day temporal link;

: Patients were recruited through anti-MMR campaigners, and the study was commissioned and funded for planned litigation.&lt;ref name=HowTheCase/&gt;}}

In an accompanying editorial, ''BMJ'' editors said:

{{bq|1=Clear evidence of falsification of data should now close the door on this damaging vaccine scare ... Who perpetrated this fraud? There is no doubt that it was Wakefield. Is it possible that he was wrong, but not dishonest: that he was so incompetent that he was unable to fairly describe the project, or to report even one of the 12 children's cases accurately? No. A great deal of thought and effort must have gone into drafting the paper to achieve the results he wanted: the discrepancies all led in one direction; misreporting was gross. Moreover, although the scale of the GMC's 217 day hearing precluded additional charges focused directly on the fraud, the panel found him guilty of dishonesty concerning the study's admissions criteria, its funding by the Legal Aid Board, and his statements about it afterwards.&lt;ref name=WakefieldarticleBMJ/&gt;}}

In a ''BMJ'' follow-up article on 11 January 2011,&lt;ref name=HowMakeMoney&gt;{{cite journal |journal= BMJ |date= 11 January 2011 |page= c5258 |volume= 342 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5258 |title= How the vaccine crisis was meant to make money |author=Deer B |url= http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5258.full |pmid=21224310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deer said that based upon documents he obtained under [[Freedom of information legislation]],&lt;ref name=WakefieldCapitalize&gt;{{cite news|url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/checkup/2011/01/wakefield_tried_to_capitalize.html | title= Wakefield tried to capitalize on autism-vaccine link, report says |author= Stein, Rob |date= 11 January 2011 |work= The Washington Post |accessdate= 12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield—in partnership with the father of one of the boys in the study—had planned to launch a venture on the back of an MMR vaccination scare that would profit from new medical tests and "litigation driven testing".&lt;ref name=AuthorHeld&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/11/autism.vaccines/?hpt=Sbin |title= Vaccine study's author held related patent, medical journal reports| publisher= CNN |date= 11 January 2011 |accessdate= 12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=patent/&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported that Deer said that Wakefield predicted he "could make more than $43 million a year from diagnostic kits" for the new condition, [[autistic enterocolitis]].&lt;ref name=WakefieldCapitalize/&gt; According to Deer's report in ''BMJ'', the ventures, Immunospecifics Biotechnologies Ltd and Carmel Healthcare Ltd—named after Wakefield's wife—failed after Wakefield's superiors at University College London's medical school gave him a two-page letter that said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We remain concerned about a possible serious conflict of interest between your academic employment by UCL, and your involvement with Carmel ... This concern arose originally because the company's business plan appears to depend on premature, scientifically unjustified publication of results, which do not conform to the rigorous academic and scientific standards that are generally expected.&lt;ref name=HowMakeMoney/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[WebMD]] reported on Deer's ''BMJ'' report, saying that the $43 million predicted yearly profits would come from marketing kits for "diagnosing patients with autism" and that "the initial market for the diagnostic will be litigation-driven testing of patients with AE [autistic enterocolitis, an unproven condition concocted by Wakefield] from both the UK and the US".&lt;ref name=DoctorPlanned&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110111/mmr-doctor-planned-make-millions-journal-claims |title= MMR Doctor 'Planned to Make Millions,' Journal Claims |author= Russell, Peter |publisher= WebMD Health News |date= 11 January 2011 |accessdate= 12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to WebMD, the ''BMJ'' article also claimed that Carmel Healthcare Ltd would succeed in marketing products and developing a replacement vaccine if "public confidence in the MMR vaccine was damaged".&lt;ref name=DoctorPlanned/&gt;

In October 2012, research published in PNAS, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, identified Wakefield's 1998 paper as the most cited retracted scientific paper, with 758 citations, and gave the "reason for retraction" as "fraud".&lt;ref name=retractions&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fang FC |title=Misconduct accounts for the majority of retracted scientific publications |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=October 2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1212247109 |author2=Steen RG |author3=Casadevall A |volume=109 |issue=42 |pages=17028–17033 |pmid=23027971 |pmc=3479492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journal retractions ===

On 2 February 2010, ''The Lancet'' formally retracted Wakefield's 1998 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/health/research/03lancet.html |title= Journal Retracts 1998 Paper Linking Autism to Vaccines |work= The New York Times |date= 2 February 2010 |accessdate= 6 January 2011 |first=Gardiner |last=Harris| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100218074131/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/health/research/03lancet.html| archivedate=18 February 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNLancetRetraction&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/02/lancet.retraction.autism/index.html?section=cnn_latest |title= Medical journal retracts study linking autism to vaccine|publisher= CNN |date= 2 February 2010 |accessdate= 2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retraction states that, "The claims in the original paper that children were 'consecutively referred' and that investigations were 'approved' by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false."&lt;ref name="retraction" /&gt;

The following day the editor of a specialist journal, ''[[Neurotoxicology (journal)|Neurotoxicology]]'', withdrew another Wakefield paper that was in press. The article, which concerned research on monkeys, had already been published online and sought to implicate vaccines in autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hewitson L |title=WITHDRAWN: Delayed acquisition of neonatal reflexes in newborn primates receiving a thimerosal-containing Hepatitis B vaccine: Influence of gestational age and birth weight |journal=Neurotoxicology |date=October 2009 |pmid=19800915 |doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2009.09.008 |author2=Houser LA |author3=Stott C |last4=Sackett |first4=Gene |last5=Tomko |first5=Jaime L. |last6=Atwood |first6=David |last7=Blue |first7=Lisa |last8=White |first8=E. Railey |last9=Wakefield |first9=Andrew J.|display-authors=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, ''[[The American Journal of Gastroenterology]]'' retracted a paper of Wakefield's that used data from the 12 patients of the article in ''The Lancet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/ajg.2010.149 |pmid= 20445528 |title= Retraction: Enterocolitis in Children With Developmental Disorders |year=2010 | author=Wakefield AJ |journal=[[The American Journal of Gastroenterology]] |volume=105 |page=1214 |issue=5 |author2= Anthony A |author3= Murch SH |last4= Thomson |first4= M |last5= Montgomery |first5= S M |last6= Davies |first6= S |last7= O'Leary |first7= J J |last8= Berelowitz |first8= M |last9= Walker-Smith |first9= J A|display-authors= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2011, ''BMJ'' editors recommended that Wakefield's other publications should be scrutinized and retracted if need be.&lt;ref name=NYTOther&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7DC1E3BF935A35752C0A9679D8B63 |title=Study Linking Vaccine to Autism is Called Fraud, Journal Reports |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wakefield response ===
As of January 2011, Wakefield continued to maintain his innocence.  In a press release, he stated,  
{{bq|1=I want to make one thing crystal clear for the record—my research and the serious medical problems found in those children were not a hoax and there was no fraud whatsoever. Nor did I seek to profit from our findings&amp;nbsp;... despite media reports to the contrary, the results of my research have been duplicated in five other countries ... I continue to fully support more independent research to determine if environmental triggers, including vaccines, are causing autism and other developmental problems&amp;nbsp;... Since the Lancet [sic] paper, I have lost my job, my career and my country. To claim that my motivation was profit is patently untrue. I will not be deterred—this issue is far too important.&lt;ref name=WakefieldStatement&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-from-dr-andrew-wakefield--no-fraud-no-hoax-no-profit-motive-113454389.html |title= Statement From Dr. Andrew Wakefield: No Fraud. No Hoax. No Profit Motive. |date= 13 January 2011 |accessdate= 13 January 2011 |publisher= PRNewswire |work= PharmaLive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an internet radio interview, Wakefield said the ''BMJ'' series "was utter nonsense" and denied "that he used the cases of the 12 children in his study to promote his business venture". Although Deer is funded by ''The Sunday Times'' and Channel 4, he has filed financial disclosure forms and denies receiving any funding from the pharmaceutical industry, which Wakefield says is paying him. According to CNN, Wakefield said the patent he held was for "an 'over-the-counter nutritional supplement' that boosts the immune system".&lt;ref name=AuthorHeld/&gt; WebMD reported that Wakefield said he was the victim of "a ruthless, pragmatic attempt to crush any attempt to investigate valid vaccine safety concerns".&lt;ref name=DoctorPlanned/&gt;

Wakefield says that Deer is a "hit man who was brought in to take [him] down" and that other scientists have simply taken Deer at his word. While on ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'',  he said that he had not read the ''BMJ'' articles yet, but he denied their validity and denied that Deer had interviewed the families of the children in the study. He also urged viewers to read his book, ''Callous Disregard'', which he said would explain why he was being targeted, to which [[Anderson Cooper]] replied: "But sir, if you're lying, then your book is also a lie. If your study is a lie, your book is a lie."&lt;ref name=Dominus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Anderson Cooper]] (interviewer), Andrew Wakefield (interviewee) | date = 6 January 2011 | title = Autism-vaccine study author defends work | publisher = CNN | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20027552-10391704.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wakefield later implied that there is a [[Cabal|conspiracy]] by [[public health]] officials and [[pharmaceutical companies]] to discredit him, including suggesting they pay bloggers to post rumours about him on websites or that they artificially inflated reports of deaths from measles.&lt;ref name=Dominus/&gt;

=== Deer counter-response ===

Deer responded to Wakefield's charge by challenging Wakefield to sue him:
{{bq|1=If it is true that Andrew Wakefield is not guilty as charged, he has the remedy of bringing a libel action against myself, ''The Sunday Times'' of London, against the medical journal here, and he would be the richest man in America.&lt;ref name=CNNElaborateFraud/&gt;}}
Deer noted that all of Wakefield's previous libel actions had been dismissed or withdrawn.&lt;ref name=Judgment/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNElaborateFraud/&gt;

In January 2012, Wakefield filed a defamation lawsuit in Texas state court against Deer, Fiona Godlee, and the ''BMJ'' for false accusations of fraud, seeking a jury trial in [[Travis County]].

The [[Associated Press]] said:

{{bq|1=Immunization rates in Britain dropped from 92 percent to 73 percent, and were as low as 50 percent in some parts of London. The effect was not nearly as dramatic in the United States, but researchers have estimated that as many as 125,000 US children born in the late 1990s did not get the MMR vaccine because of the Wakefield splash.&lt;ref name=APVaccineBooster/&gt;}}

[[ABC News]] Channel WWAY3 said:

{{bq|1=Since Dr. Andrew Wakefield's study was released in 1998, many parents have been convinced the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine could lead to autism. But that study may have done more harm than good.  According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], in the United States, more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than any year since 1997. More than 90 percent of those infected had not been vaccinated, or their vaccination status was not known.&lt;ref name=Jasek/&gt;}}

[[Paul Hébert]], editor-in-chief of the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' (CMAJ) said:

{{bq|1=There has been a huge impact from the Wakefield fiasco ... This spawned a whole anti-vaccine movement. Great Britain has seen measles outbreaks. It probably resulted in a lot of deaths.&lt;ref name=RossStarFraudulent/&gt;}}

A profile in a ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' article noted:

{{bq|1=Andrew Wakefield has become one of the most reviled doctors of his generation, blamed directly and indirectly, depending on the accuser, for irresponsibly starting a panic with tragic repercussions: vaccination rates so low that childhood diseases once all but eradicated here—whooping cough and measles, among them—have re-emerged, endangering young lives.&lt;ref name=Dominus&gt;{{cite news|last=Dominus|first=Susan|title=The Crash and Burn of an Autism Guru|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24Autism-t.html?_r=1|accessdate=31 May 2011|newspaper=New York Times Magazine|date=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

J. B.

On 1 April 2011, the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] awarded Wakefield the [[Pigasus Award]] for "refusal to face reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author= Crabtree, Sadie |date= 1 April 2011 |title= The 5 Worst Promoters of Nonsense |url= http://www.randi.org/site/jref-news/1260-pigasus-2011 |publisher= James Randi Educational Foundation |accessdate= 6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A writer from ''The New York Times'', who was covering a 2011 event in [[Tomball, Texas]] where Wakefield spoke, was threatened by its organizer, Michelle Guppy: "Be nice to him, or we will hurt you." Guppy is the coordinator of the Houston Autism Disability Network.&lt;ref name=Dominus/&gt;

In June 2012, a local court in [[Rimini]], Italy, ruled that the MMR vaccination had caused autism in a 15-month-old boy. The court relied heavily on Wakefield's discredited ''Lancet'' paper and largely ignored the scientific evidence presented to it. The decision was appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2013/08/09/court-rulings-dont-confirm-autism-vaccine-link/|title=Court Rulings Don't Confirm Autism-Vaccine Link|publisher=[[Forbes]]|author=Willingham E|date=8 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 2015, the decision was overturned by a Court of Appeals in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name=Bocci&gt;{{Citation |last=Bocci |first=Michele |date=1 March 2015 |title=Autismo, i giudici assolvono il vaccino ("Autism, the judges acquit the vaccine") |publisher=la Repubblica.it |url=http://www.repubblica.it/salute/medicina/2015/03/01/news/autismo_i_giudici_assolvono_il_vaccino-108441541/ |accessdate=4 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Wakefield denied that he bore any responsibility for the [[Measles outbreaks in the 21st century#United States|measles epidemic]] which started at [[Disneyland]]. He also reaffirmed his discredited belief that "MMR contributes to the current autism epidemic".&lt;ref name=Ziv&gt;{{cite web |last=Ziv |first=Stav |date=10 February 2015 |title=Andrew Wakefield, Father of the Anti-Vaccine Movement, Responds to the Current Measles Outbreak for the First Time |work=[[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/20/andrew-wakefield-father-anti-vaccine-movement-sticks-his-story-305836.html |accessdate=16 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time at least 166 cases had been reported.

Filmmaker Miranda Bailey followed Wakefield and his wife Carmel and their children for five years filming a documentary about Wakefield as a person, ''The Pathological Optimist''. According to Robert Ladendorf writing for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine, Bailey attempted to remain neutral and add a "human touch" which Ladendorf says was successful. Wakefield is shown "as a soft-spoken but beleaguered family man trying to resurrect his reputation and raising money for his legal fund."&lt;ref name="Ladendorf"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladendorf|first1=Robert|title=Following Disgraced Doctor Andrew Wakefield|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=2018|volume=42|issue=3|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Kohlmann, S.J.''' (13 July 1771&amp;nbsp;– 11 April 1836), was an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[Jesuit]] priest. He is known for his part in the establishment of [[Confessional Privilege (United States)|confessional privilege]] in United States law. He spent nearly a quarter of a century in that nation as an educator.

==Early life==
Kohlmann was born at [[Kaysersberg]], then in the ancient province of [[Alsace]], in the [[Kingdom of France]]. He had joined the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]]s but was compelled by the troubles of the [[French Revolution]] to go to Switzerland, where at the [[seminary]] of [[Fribourg]] he completed his theological studies and was ordained a priest in 1796.&lt;ref name=sjrest&gt;[http://www.sj2014.net/blog/april-10-1836-antthony-kohlmann-sj-dies-giant-of-restored-society "April 10 1836 - Antthony Kohlmann SJ dies, giant of restored society," Jesuit Restoration 1814]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, he joined the Congregation of the Fathers of the Sacred Heart, founded by Tourneley and de Broglia in [[Vienna]]. With them he spent some time in Austria, where he distinguished himself by his tireless efforts during a plague at Hagenbrunn. He then served as a [[military chaplain]] at a hospital in Pavia. In 1801, he was sent from Italy to [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]] in [[Bavaria]], as director of a seminary, then to [[Berlin]], and [[Amsterdam]], to direct a college established by the Fathers of the Faith of Jesus with which the Congregation of the Sacred Heart had united (11 April 1799).

==Jesuit==
The Jesuits, in Russia, still functioned as a religious community after the [[suppression of the Society of Jesus]] in Catholic Europe and were recognized in 1801 by [[Pope Pius VII]]. Kohlmann applied for admission to the Society, and while waiting for a response, he spent time at Kensington College in London. He went to Russia and entered the Jesuit novitiate on 21 June 1803. In response to a call for additional workers in the United States, he was sent to [[Georgetown, D.C.]], arriving in Baltimore on November 4, 1806. Here he was made assistant to the [[Master of novices]],&lt;ref name=sjrest/&gt; and taught philosophy. He would also undertake preaching tours to German-speaking congregations in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]]. His missionary travels to the largely German Catholic community took him to Alexandria, Philadelphia, Lancaster, Colman's Furnace, and Baltimore.

==United States==
===New York===
[[File:Old Saint Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Manhattan, New York.jpg|thumb|220px|St. Peter's Church, 1785]]

In March 1808, German Catholics in New York had written Bishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]], then the leader of the Catholic Church for the entire country, to request for him to send them a German-speaking priest so that they could be ministered to in their own language. Prior to that, they were able to have services at St. Peter's when a missionary from Pennsylvania would occasionally visit. Bishop Carroll appointed Father Anthony S.J., who arrived later that year with his fellow Jesuits, [[Benedict Fenwick]] and four scholastics (seminarians), James Wallace, Michael White, James Redmond and [[Adam Marshall (priest)|Adam Marshall]], he took charge there in October 1808.&lt;ref name=sjrest/&gt; Father Kohlmann succeeded Matthew Byrne as rector of St. Peter's, where he held services in English, German and French.&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt; (Father Byrne wished to resign as pastor of St. Peter's parish in order to enter the Society of Jesus.)   

It was a time of great commercial depression in the city because of the results of the [[Embargo Act]] of 22 December 1807. The Catholic population, he stated in a letter written on 8 November 1808, consisted "of Irish, some hundreds of French and as many Germans; in all according to the common estimation of 14,000 souls."&lt;ref name=Parsons&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25011548?seq=2 Parsons S. J., J. Wilfrid. "Rev. Anthony Kohlmann, S. J. (1771-1824)", ''The Catholic Historical Review'', Vol. 4, No. 1, Apr., Catholic University of America Press, 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;In 1808, Kohlmann was named Vicar General for Bishop [[Luke Concanen]], the newly-appointed bishop of New York, whose departure from Rome was delayed by Napoleon's control of Italian ports.&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;[http://cny.org/stories/Our-History-Seven-Years-and-No-Bishop,101?content_source=&amp;category_id=&amp;search_filter=In+the+Holiness+of+Truth&amp;search_headline=&amp;event_mode=&amp;event_ts_from=&amp;list_type=&amp;order_by=&amp;order_sort=&amp;content_class=&amp;sub_type=stories&amp;town_id= Egan, Edward. "Our History: Seven Years and No Bishop", ''Catholic New York'', June 8, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such progress was made under his direction that the cornerstone of a new church, the original [[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], the second church erected in New York, was laid on 8 June 1809. He selected a site, at that time, outside the city, surrounded by country homes of the wealthy and scattered farms. Sermons were preached on Sundays in English, French and German.

Kohlmann started a classical school called the New York Literary Institution, which he carried on successfully for several years in what was then a suburban village but is now the site of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. In April 1812, he also started a school for girls in the same neighborhood, in the charge of [[Ursuline nuns]] who came at his invitation for that purpose from their monastery in [[County Cork]], Ireland.

====Seal of the confessional====
Around then, Kohlmann became the central figure in a lawsuit that stirred national interest. He had been instrumental in having stolen goods restored to the owner. When the owner then requested for the police to drop the case, they insisted that Kohlmann reveal the identity of the thief who had returned the goods. Kohlmann refused to do so on the ground that his information had been received under the [[Seal of the Confessional and the Catholic Church|seal of the confessional]]. The case was taken before the [[New York Court of Chancery]], where Kohlmann's defence lawyer was an Irish Protestant named William Sampson. After a trial, the decision rendered by Mayor [[De Witt Clinton]] in the priest's favor;&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is essential to the free exercise of a religion, that its ordinances should be administered – that its ceremonies as well as its essentials should be protected. Secrecy is of the essence of penance. The sinner will not confess, nor will the priest receive his confession, if the veil of secrecy is removed....&lt;ref name=restor&gt; [http://www.sj2014.net/blog/category/the-americas "14 June 1813 - Fr Kohlmann aquitted &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; in landmark trial in US", Jesuit Restoration 1814]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

That was the first legal affirmation of confessional privilege in American history and a key moment in Americas tradition of freedom of religion.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt; The principle was later embodied in a [[New York State]] law, passed on 10 December 1828: "No minister of the Gospel or priest of any denomination whatsoever shall be allowed to disclose any confession made to him in his professional character in the course of discipline enjoined by the rules or practices of such denomination." The protection from being forced to testify or provide information to law enforcement agencies became accepted nationwide in the United States.

To a report of the case when it was published, Kohlmann added an exposition of the teachings of the Church on [[penance]]. &lt;ref&gt;Sampson, William. "The Catholic Question in America", appendix, New York, 1813&lt;/ref&gt; The book excited a long and vigorous controversy with a number of Protestant ministers and was followed in 1821 by another learned work, "Unitarianism, Theologically and Philosophically considered" in which Kohlmann replied to the assertions of [[Jared Sparks]] and other [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] leaders.

===Georgetown===
New York had no bishop of its own as yet, the first appointed having died in Italy before he reached his see, and Kohlmann governed as its [[Apostolic Administrator]] for several years. In 1815, expecting the imminent arrival of the second bishop, [[John Connolly (bishop)|John Connolly]], he returned to Georgetown, where he served as Master of novices, and in 1817 became superior. He served as the [[List of Presidents of Georgetown University|President]] of [[Georgetown University|Georgetown College]] from 1817-1820. In 1821 Kohlman founded the Washington Seminary, which later became [[Gonzaga College High School]].&lt;ref name=Parsons/&gt; He served as its president until 1824, when he was recalled to Rome by Pope Leo XII to become the chair of theology at the [[Roman College]], and was succeeded by [[Adam Marshall (priest)|Adam Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZoaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Gonzaga College, an Historical Sketch: From Its Foundation in 1821, to the Solemn Celebration of Its First Centenary in 1921|last=Hill|first=Owen Aloysius|publisher=Gonzaga College High School|year=1922|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=26–27|access-date=September 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916032949/https://books.google.com/books?id=mZoaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=September 16, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Miracle====
Shortly afterward, Kohlmann became interested in the work of Rev. Prince Alexander von [[Prince Alexander of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst|Hohenlohe]], a charismatic German priest and nobleman, who claimed to be able to effect miracle cures. Hohenlohe was supposed, in particular, to have saved the life of a German princess, Mathilda von Schwarzenburg, when he and a peasant associate prayed over her. The case was much publicized, and although the Catholic authorities in Europe never endorsed Hohenlohe's cures, many, including Kohlmann, believed in them.

In 1824 Kohlman learned that a prominent Washington Catholic, Mrs. Ann Mattingly, was suffering from cancer, and decided to contact Hohenlohe in an effort to cure her. He wrote to the princely miracle worker in [[Bamberg]], Germany, and got him to agree to pray for Mrs. Mattingly at a certain precise time several months later. In Washington, he arranged for one of his Jesuit colleagues to say Mass by her bedside at the chosen hour while he celebrated yet another Mass in the Georgetown University chapel.

The trans-Atlantic negotiations took some time, and meanwhile, Mattingly’s condition worsened. Her brother, [[Thomas Carbery]], [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]], protested to Kohlmann that she would be dead before the prayer session could occur, but the Jesuit told him not to worry, as the splendor of the miracle would be all the greater for occurring at the very last minute. At the appointed time, the three priests said their Masses in their respective locations. Soon afterwards Mattingly arose from her bed, proclaimed herself entirely cured, and went on to live in good health for another 30 years.&lt;ref name=Parsons/&gt;

The story of her cure attracted great interest in the press. To some Catholics, it was proof of the power of prayer and of the superiority of their religion, but to Protestants and freethinkers," it smacked of medieval superstition and priestly chicanery. The Catholic hierarchy stood aloof from the conflict, and none of Hohenlohe's "miracles" was ever endorsed by the Church, certainly not the cure of Mrs. Mattingly, at which he had not even been present.

==Later life==
Later that year, when [[Pope Leo XII]] restored the [[Gregorian University]] to the direction of the Society of Jesus, Kohlmann was summoned to Rome to take the [[Professor|Chair]] of Theology, which he filled for five years. One of his pupils then was the subsequent [[Pope Leo XIII]]; others became later Archbishop of Dublin and the first Irish cardinal ([[Paul Cullen (cardinal)|Paul Cullen]]). Popes Leo XII and Gregory XVI both held Kohlmann in high esteem and had him attached as a consultant to the staffs of the [[College of Cardinals]] and several of the important [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|Congregations]], including that of [[Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs|Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], of Bishops and Regulars.&lt;ref name=Meehan&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08686c.htm Meehan, Thomas. "Antony Kohlmann." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 6 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last part of his life he spent as a confessor in the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome, where during the Lenten season of 1836, he overtaxed himself and brought on an attack of pneumonia that ended his life.&lt;ref name=Meehan/&gt;

==Legacy==
Father Kohlmann's defense of the "seal of the confessional" led to the statutory recognition of the "confessional privilege" in New York State law, later followed by other jurisdictions.
 
Fordham University's Kohlmann Hall is the residence hall for the Jesuits teaching at Fordham Prep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/audience/tours/rh_map/39_kohlman_hall.shtml "Kohlmann Hall", Fordham University]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{UKtaxation}}
The '''Apprenticeship Levy''' is a UK tax on employers which can be used to fund [[apprenticeship]] training. In the current (2018/19) tax year it is payable by all employers with an annual pay bill of more than £3 million at a rate of 0.5% of their total pay bill.

==History==
The Apprenticeship Levy was announced by [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] in the [[July 2015 United Kingdom budget|July 2015 budget]] which was held following that year's General Election.&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]], [https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-summer-budget-2015-speech Chancellor George Osborne's Summer Budget 2015 speech], accessed 4 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently incorporated into law by Part 6 of the Finance Act 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finance Act 2016, Part 6|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/24/part/6|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=UK government|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came into effect at the start of the 2017/18 UK tax year on 6th April 2017. It was projected to raise £2.675 billion in its first year of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information on Apprenticeship Levy|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545145/Apprenticeships_-expected_levy_and_total_spend_-_Aug_2016.pdf|publisher=UK Department for Education|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

The Apprenticeship Levy is paid by employers with annual pay bills in excess of £3 million. In this context, the pay bill is defined as the earnings liable to class 1 secondary [[National Insurance]] contributions. The levy is payable at 0.5% of the total pay bill (i.e. not just the element over £3 million) minus an annual "levy allowance" of £15,000,&lt;ref&gt;[[HMRC]], [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/579262/Apprenticeship-levy-Spec-Guidance-Pack-v1-6.pdf Apprenticeship Levy - guidance for software developers], updated 9 September 2016, accessed 4 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; although the total amount payable equates to exactly 0.5% of the element over £3 million.

The levy due by an employer is paid to [[HMRC]] through the [[Pay-as-you-earn tax#United Kingdom|Pay-as-you-earn]] ([[PAYE|P.A.Y.E]]) process alongside payment of [[Income Tax]] and [[National Insurance contributions]]&lt;ref&gt;BPP University/BPP Professional Education, [https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bppassets/public/assets/pdf/brochures/bpp-professional-apprenticeships-levy-guide.pdf Employer Guide: Apprenticeship Levy Key Facts, October 2016 update], accessed 10 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and is held in a 'digital fund' that employer can use to pay for apprenticeship training. A 10% contribution is added to each monthly payment.

Funds in the digital fund remain available for 24 months from the date of payment. Any amount that remains unspent after that period will expire and will be reclaimed by HMRC, including the 10% contribution.

Payment from the digital fund is made directly to training providers on a monthly basis, for as long as the apprentice remains on the scheme (i.e., until the apprenticeship is completed or the apprentice leaves). Any apprenticeship that is terminated less than 42 days after the start of the apprenticeship will not qualify for any payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-technical-funding-guide|title=Apprenticeship technical funding guide - GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Levy-paying firms can share up to 10% of their levy with other businesses. When this provision was introduced, a firm could only nominate one other company to receive its levy fund, but from July 2018 this was extended to as many firms as the levy-payer wished.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Education, [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/greater-flexibility-for-apprenticeship-levy-as-transfers-extended Greater flexibility for apprenticeship levy as transfers extended], published 26 June 2018, accessed 5 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. On 1 October, [[Philip Hammond|Philip Hammond MP]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], announced that from April 2019 &lt;ref&gt;Seetec, [https://www.seetec.co.uk/insights/transferring-apprenticeship-levy-funds-to-other-companies From April 2019 you’ll be able to transfer 25% of your levy funds to other companies, according to an announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer], accessed 13 October 2019&lt;/ref&gt; firms would be able to share up to 25% of their levy with other businesses in their [[supply chain]],&lt;ref&gt;HM Treasury, [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/package-of-measures-unveiled-to-boost-apprenticeships Package of measures unveiled to boost apprenticeships], published 1 October, accessed 3 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; a move which was welcomed by businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federation of Master Builders]], [https://www.fmb.org.uk/about-the-fmb/newsroom/chancellor-right-to-make-apprenticeship-levy-more-flexible/ Chancellor right to make Apprenticeship Levy more flexible], published 4 October 2018, accessed 5 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the levy for funding apprenticeships which commence after 1 May 2017 is the responsibility of the [[Department for Education]] and the [[Skills Funding Agency]] in England. There are separate arrangements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, since apprenticeships are a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Education, [https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/apprenticeship-changes Apprenticeship Funding], updated 12 August 2016, accessed 10 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bassil Da Costa'''{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} ([[Guatire]], 7 May 1990 – [[Caracas]], 12 February 2014) was a [[Venezuela]]n university student, killed during the [[2014–15 Venezuelan protests|2014 protests]] against the [[Government of Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=ultimasnoticias1/&gt; Da Costa was a marketing student at the [[Universidad Alejandro de Humboldt]] in [[Caracas]].&lt;ref name=duelo/&gt;

==Death==
On 12 February 2014, Youth Day in Venezuela, various parties in opposition to the [[Government of Venezuela|Venezuelan Government]] and student groups marched in the entire country in protest against the government. In Caracas, the protest march was held from [[Plaza Venezuela]] to the [[Public Ministry of Venezuela|Public Ministry]]'s offices in the city's downtown.&lt;ref name=sunoticiero/&gt;&lt;ref name=patilla/&gt; The demonstration itself went smoothly, but after it was finished conflict arose with a shootout in which Da Costa and Juan Montoya, member of a [[Colectivo (Venezuela)|colectivo]], were killed.

On 13 February, President [[Nicolás Maduro]] stated Da Costa and Montoya were killed by the same person, and that the murders were part of the violence generated by the opposition on 12 February.&lt;ref name=orinoco/&gt; The Secretary of the [[Democratic Unity Roundtable]] (MUD), the opposition coalition, [[Ramón Guillermo Aveledo]], rejected President Maduro's statements and maintained the protesters were not ill-intended, while hinting at possible government infiltrates in the march.&lt;ref name=ultimasnoticias2/&gt;

===Investigations===
The first investigations made by the [[Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas, Penales y Criminalísticas]] (CICPC) identified at least three members of the [[Bolivarian Intelligence Service]] (SEBIN) who had shot against protesters near the Public Ministry offices the day of the march, amongst them the alleged killer of Da Costa.&lt;ref name=notitarde/&gt;

Days later, the independent newspaper ''[[Últimas Noticias]]'' published the results of an investigative work on the murders, in which it claimed to have discovered both men in uniform and civilians had shot against the protesters on the 12th of February.&lt;ref name=ultimasnoticias3/&gt; In April 2014, six SEBIN officers were apprehended and the alleged murderer of Da Costa was formally accused.&lt;ref name=elnacional/&gt;

The trial on Da Costa and Montoya's murders was delayed in various occasions,&lt;ref name=eluniversal/&gt; until it finally started on 16 June 2015, over a year after they took place.&lt;ref name=runrunes/&gt;

The '''Beloe Report''', commissioned in the late 1950s in the United Kingdom, led directly to the implementation of the [[Certificate of Secondary Education]], the CSE examination which would exist from 1965 to 1987. The CSE was withdrawn at the same time as the [[GCE Ordinary Level]] exam.

==History==
The GCE exam had been introduced in 1951. The Beloe Committee met from 1958-60. Rev [[Robert Beloe]] CBE was the Chief Education Officer of [[Surrey]] from 1940-59, beginning when only 35. He had created the system of [[grammar school]]s in Surrey in the late 1940s. He had created many [[Partially selective school (England)|bilateral school]]s in Surrey in the 1950s, which were effectively comprehensive schools; this was to reduce the cost of building brand new grammar schools, and made the implementation of the comprehensive system in Surrey, in the 1970s, more straightforward than other [[Local education authority|local education authorities]]. He was appointed CBE in the [[1960 New Year Honours]].

The report was published in July 1960 by a committee of the [[Secondary Schools Examinations Council]] - the Committee on '''Secondary School Examinations other than the G.C.E.''', appointed in July 1958.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'' January 4, 1961, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Beloe died on 26 April 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'' Obituary 30 April 1984, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; The report was overseen by the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]].

At the time, many of those at secondary schools left at age 15 - currently [[Year Ten]]. It would not be until 1973 that the school leaving age rose to 16, now known as [[Year Eleven]]. The CSE would be mainly, though not exclusively, aimed at people at [[secondary modern school]]s, or the early [[comprehensive school]]s. The new CSE exam would give secondary modern schools an incentive to have fifth forms - for those who voluntarily wanted to stay at school beyond the [[Dropping Out age|school leaving age]]; this would help prove that education futures were not always narrowly defined by the [[eleven-plus]] exam. The report may have had direct consequences for the idea of comprehensive schools; before the CSE, there was no widely recognized exam for most people who had not gained a place at grammar school.

===Contents===
The report, with scope for education in secondary schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, recommended that a new examination be introduced with a different emphasis from that of the highly-academic GCE O level, which required rigorous knowledge of subjects.

20% of those at 16 took the GCE exam, and the CSE would cover the next 20%. The exam was to be a different kind of exam to the GCE, and not simply a watered-down GCE. The exam would be set mainly by teachers, sitting on 20 regional bodies.

===Implementation of the GCSE===
Although the GCSE, introduced in 1986 with first examinations in 1988, covered much, if not most, of the ground of the previous CSE, the GCSE has not adequately replaced the rigour of what the former O-level offered. The Beloe Report therefore would eventually lead the way largely to what became the GCSE. The 1978 [[Waddell Report]] had advocated a common examination, prepared by Sir [[James Waddell (civil servant)|James Waddell]], which hoped that the new common exam would be first sat by 1985.

The '''Universität der Künste Berlin''' ('''UdK'''; '''Berlin University of the Arts'''), situated in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], is the largest [[art school]] in [[Europe]]. It is a public art and design school, and one of the four [[Universities and research institutions in Berlin|research universities]] in the city.

The university is known for being one of the biggest and most diversified universities of the arts worldwide. It has four colleges specialising in [[fine arts]], [[architecture]], [[Mass media|media]] and [[design]], [[music]] and the [[performing arts]] with around 3,500 students. Thus the UdK is one of only three universities in Germany to unite the faculties of art and music in one institution. The teaching offered at the four colleges encompasses the full spectrum of the arts and related academic studies in more than 40 courses. Having the right to confer doctorates and post-doctoral qualifications, Berlin University of the Arts is also one of Germany's few art colleges with full university status.

Outstanding professors and students at all its colleges, as well as the steady development of teaching concepts, have publicly defined the university as a high standard of artistic and art-theoretical education. Almost all the study courses at Berlin University of the Arts are part of a centuries-old tradition. Thus Berlin University of the Arts gives its students- at an early stage of rigorously selected artists and within the protected sphere of a study course – the opportunity to investigate and experiment with other art forms in order to recognise and extend the boundaries of their own discipline.

Within the field of [[Visual Arts]], the university is known for the intense competition that involves the selection of its students, and the growth of applicants worldwide has increased during the years, due to Berlin's important current role in the cultural innovation worldwide. In the same way, the University of the Arts is publicly recognized for being on the cutting edge in the areas of Visual Arts, Fashion Design, Industrial Design and Experimental Design.

==History==
Its roots institutions date back to the foundation of ''Academie der Mal-, Bild- und Baukunst'' (Academy of the Art of Painting, Pictorial Art and Architecture), the later [[Prussian Academy of Arts]], at the behest of Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III of Brandenburg]]. The two predecessor organisations were ''Königlich Akademischen Hochschule für ausübende Tonkunst''  (Royal Academy of Musical Performing Art) established in 1869 under [[Joseph Joachim]], which also had adopted the tradition of the famous [[Stern Conservatory]], and the ''Berlin State School of Fine Arts'' founded in 1875.

In 1975, both art schools merged under the name ''Hochschule der Künste Berlin, HdK''. The organization received the title of a [[university]] on 1 November 2001.

==Exchange program==
The exchange program with UDK is a direct enrollment program offered during the fall, spring and academic year to students interested in the arts and with four semesters of German language study. Each academic year the school receives 100 exchange students on the basis of institutional agreements. Students participating in the exchange are required to subsidize their own accommodations with little help from the school.

==Art fair==
Annually, the university opens its doors to the public in its four colleges (UdK Rundgang), offering one of the most important art fairs in Berlin due to new proposals that highlight its young artists.

The '''Boston National Historical Park''' is an association of sites that showcase [[Boston]]'s role in the [[American Revolution]]. It was designated a national park on October 1, 1974. Seven of the eight sites are connected by the [[Freedom Trail]], a walking tour of downtown Boston. All eight properties are [[National Historic Landmarks]].

Five of the sites that make up the park are neither owned nor operated by the [[National Park Service]], and operate through cooperative agreements established upon the park's creation.   The park service operates visitor centers in [[Faneuil Hall]] and at the [[Boston Navy Yard|Charlestown Navy Yard]].

==Properties==
{{see also|Freedom Trail}}

===Bunker Hill Monument===
The [[Bunker Hill Monument]], located at the top of [[Breed's Hill]] in the [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] neighborhood of Boston, is a granite [[obelisk]] that was constructed in the mid-19th century to commemorate the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], fought June 17, 1775.  The property is owned and administered by the National Park Service.  The park service also operates the nearby Bunker Hill Museum.

===Charlestown Navy Yard===
The [[Boston Navy Yard|Charlestown Navy Yard]] is located on the southern edge of Charlestown on the banks of the [[Charles River]].  Used during the [[American Revolutionary War]] as a shipyard, it continued to serve as a base of the [[United States Navy]] until 1975, when the Navy turned the property over to the National Park Service.  The Yard is home to the [[USS Constitution]] (the oldest floating commissioned naval vessel in the world), and the [[USS Cassin Young (DD-793)|USS ''Cassin Young'']], a destroyer from the [[Second World War]] that is now operated as a museum ship.

===Dorchester Heights===
[[Dorchester Heights]] was [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|fortified]] by General [[George Washington]] in March 1776, compelling the British to withdraw from Boston and ending the [[Siege of Boston]].  A monument was erected on the site in 1902.  Located in [[South Boston]], Dorchester Heights is the only site in the park that is not on the [[Freedom Trail]].

===Faneuil Hall===
[[Faneuil Hall]] was first constructed in the 1740s, and was the site of important pro-independence speeches.  The hall is owned and operated by the city of Boston, with the park service offering talks in the Great Hall.

===Old North Church===
The [[Old North Church]], built in 1723, was the location where [[Paul Revere]] had signal lanterns lit on the night of April 18, 1775, prior to his "midnight ride" that led to the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] and the start of the revolutionary war.  The church, the oldest operating in Boston, has an Episcopalian congregation, which owns and operates the building.

===Old South Meeting House===
The [[Old South Meeting House]], built in 1729 was the site of numerous pre-revolutionary meetings, including one, attended by a crowd estimated at more than 5,000, on the evening prior to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in December 1773.  It served as a church until 1877, when it became a museum operated by a nonprofit organization dedicated to its preservation.

===Old State House===
The [[Old State House (Boston)|Old State House]] is the oldest municipal building in Boston.  Built in 1713, it was the seat of the colonial government, and afterward the state government, until 1798.  The [[Boston Massacre]] took place just in front of the building.  In 1881 it was saved from destruction by the [[Bostonian Society]], which was formed specifically to preserve it.  The society still operates the City owned building as a museum.  The Boston Massacre is reenacted regularly under the society's auspices.

===Paul Revere House===
Now owned and operated by the Paul Revere Memorial Association, the [[Paul Revere House]] is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Boston.  It was built in 1680, and was purchased by [[Paul Revere]] in 1770.  It is now a museum.

==Park Service activities==
The National Park Service, in addition to managing its properties that are part of the park, operates visitor centers at Faneuil Hall (1st Floor) and at the Navy Yard.  It offers guided tours of the Freedom Trail.  The Navy offers tours of the USS ''Constitution''.

'''Albizu University''' is a private, non-profit university offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in the fields of psychology, education, speech and language, criminal justice, ESOL, and human services. With the main campus in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]], a branch campus in [[Miami, Florida]], and an additional instructional location in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]], the university provides professional training that is relevant and responsive to the mental health needs of multicultural communities and supports culturally sensitive research that contributes to and helps grow the professions of psychology, health, education, and human services.

==History==
The university’s history began in 1966, when a renowned Puerto Rican psychologist and educator, [[Carlos Albizu Miranda|Dr. Carlos Albizu-Miranda]], founded the Instituto Psicológico de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology) in response to the need for culturally sensitive professional training in the area of clinical psychology. At the time, there were no graduate programs in clinical psychology in Puerto Rico. [[University of Puerto Rico|The University of Puerto Rico]] and the Normal School (later known as the College of Education) included psychology as part of the core curricula as early as 1903—but only for undergraduate studies that were heavily based on the American higher education system and its standards. Graduate-level degrees in psychology could only be obtained through schools in the United States.

By the early 1960s, little had changed, with mental health professionals being trained abroad and then returning to their home country with the challenge of adapting what they had learned in the United States to fit the sociocultural realities of a Hispanic community. Dr. Albizu-Miranda himself received his training at [[Purdue University]] in West Lafayette, Indiana, and incurred the same difficulties of incorporating what he had learned into the culture of the island upon returning home to Puerto Rico.

What had changed, though, was the social climate of the island. Between 1947 and the late 1960s, Puerto Rico saw major industrialization that transformed the island from a rural agrarian to an urban industrial society. With this, came the establishment of social classes, modern capitalism, and economic consumption—along with confusion and insecurity that led to issues such as violence and drug use. By the 1960s, the population had grown to nearly three million people, with only five clinical psychologists on the island to support the growing need for social services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953972809|title=Love Reaches Beyond Knowledge: Dr. Carlos Albizu Miranda, Architect of Modern Multicultural Psychology|last=|first=|publisher=Universidad Carlos Albizu and Publicaciones Gaviota|others=Gotay, Samel Silva; Mayo Santana, Raul; Vazquez, Nieve de los Angeles|year=2014|isbn=9781365107672|edition=First|location=San Juan, Puerto Rico|pages=226, 241|oclc=953972809}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to meet the public’s demands, the government established what were known as “assistant psychologists.” These assistant psychologists for the most part had had little training and were not equipped to serve what was becoming an increasingly complex population. By 1964, Dr. Albizu-Miranda had begun envisioning a Puerto Rican-based graduate program that would address the need for multicultural professional training in psychology on the island, along with the need for greater numbers of clinically trained psychologists to serve the growing population.

Between 1964 and 1966, Dr. Albizu-Miranda held multiple meetings with the chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico to discuss the development of a graduate program in psychology. After two years of fruitless efforts, Dr. Albizu-Miranda decided to turn away from the state university and establish a self-governing and independent institution. On August 1, 1966, he incorporated the Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology and welcomed the Institute’s inaugural academic year in 1967-1968.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recognizing a parallel need for multicultural training in clinical psychology in Southern Florida, which has a large Hispanic population, Dr. Albizu-Miranda opened the Miami Institute of Psychology in Miami, Florida, in 1980. In January 2000, the two main campuses were merged under the shared name Carlos Albizu University in honor of their founder, becoming the first institution in North America to be named after a Hispanic. Today, they are commonly known as Albizu University and continue the tradition of offering programs, both in theory and practice, that stay true to addressing and honoring the multicultural heritages found in both Puerto Rico and South Florida.

==Campuses==
Albizu University has two campuses; the main campus in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and a branch campus in Miami, Florida. There is a third, instructional, location in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]].

=== San Juan Campus ===
[[File:Carlos Albizu University, San Juan Campus - Buildings in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico - DSC06950.JPG|thumb|Albizu University, San Juan Campus]]
Located in the heart of Puerto Rico’s capital city, the San Juan campus set a precedent as the first independent professional school of psychology in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/psychologists/carlos-albizu-miranda.aspx|title=Featured Psychologist: Carlos Albizu Miranda, PhD|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called the Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology, Dr. Albizu-Miranda modeled the university after institutes of psychology in Europe where practice and internship coexisted. Now, over 50 years since its founding, the San Juan campus has over 1,000 students and has expanded to include two on-campus training clinics: the Clínica de Salud Mental de la Comunidad (Community Mental Health Clinic) and the Clínica de Patología del Habla y Lenguaje (Speech and Language Pathology Clinic).

==== The Community Mental Health Clinic ====
The Community Mental Health Clinic (CMHC) is a training clinic on the campus of Albizu University in San Juan, Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albizu.edu/our-clinics/community-mental-health-clinic|title=Albizu University &gt; Our Clinics &gt; Community Mental Health Clinic|last=University|first=Albizu|website=www.albizu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An active clinic that provides culturally sensitive mental health services to low income and minority clients in San Juan and surrounding communities, CMHC also serves as a practicum and internship site for Albizu University graduate students.

==== Speech and Language Pathology Clinic ====
Based at Albizu University’s San Juan campus, the Speech and Language Pathology Clinic provides culturally sensitive care in the areas of autism, dysphagia, motor-speech disorders, neurological impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive disabilities, and developmental disorders. Graduate students from the university’s M.S. in Speech and Language Pathology program work closely with licensed and certified pathologists to provide care to a diverse population while gaining clinical experience.

===Miami Campus===
[[File:Carlos Albizu University - Miami branch.png|thumb|Albizu University's branch campus in Miami, Florida.]]
Located in the Miami, Florida, metropolitan area, the Miami campus offers over 30 undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs in the fields of psychology, education, speech and language, English as a second language (ESOL), criminal justice, and human services. Known as the “Gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/blog/post/miami-innovation-gateway-latin-america/33946|title=Miami: Innovation Gateway to Latin America|last=importer|date=2013-03-20|work=U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miami has one of the largest multi-ethnic populations in the United States, thus providing the perfect environment to support Albizu University in its mission to offer culturally sensitive training to a diverse population in an area with a wide range of practical training sites.

==== The Goodman Psychological Services Center ====
Founded in 1980, The Goodman Psychological Services Center (GPSC), was established with the purpose of providing quality, culturally sensitive, mental health services to low-income, minority, clients in Southern Florida. Sponsored by Albizu University, the Goodman Center is also a practicum site housing four training programs; the Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology program, the M.S. in Psychology program with a major in Marriage and Family Therapy, the M.S. in Speech and Language Pathology program, and the GPSC Doctoral Internship Consortium Program.

Since its inception, the Goodman Center has provided care to nearly 10,000 people of all ages in communities that are typically underserved due to factors such as financial hardship, limited or no insurance coverage, and lack of proficiency in the English language. In addition to the mental health services provided at the center, the Goodman Center is contracted by [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] County Public Schools to conduct psychoeducational evaluations for both private referrals and a host of community agencies, including the Florida Department of Families and Children and other health centers. 
[[File:Mayaguez Center view.jpg|left|thumb|Mayagüez City Center]]
In addition to partnering with the [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools]], the Goodman Center has also established a close relationship with [[Camillus House]], a long-standing community center in Miami-Dade County that provides humanitarian services to the poor and homeless. Through its Doctoral Internship Consortium Program, Albizu provides eight full-time internship spots per year—six at the Goodman Center and two at Camillus House—to clinical psychology doctoral students. In the past, these internships were available only to Albizu University students. This year, for the first time, the internships will be available on a national level to all graduate students who come from an APA-accredited clinical psychology doctoral program.

=== Mayagüez University Center ===
In January 2015, Albizu opened an extension in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]]. Under the jurisdiction of the San Juan Campus, the location was created to provide academic offerings and clinical services to the western region of Puerto Rico. Known as the Mayagüez University Center, the facility is much smaller than the other two campuses, with degrees offered exclusively in the fields of psychology and speech and language pathology. With an on-site clinic, the Center is also able to offer students clinical practice while providing health services to the community.

The Mayagüez University Center is located in the heart of the city of Mayagüez. Known as an intellectual mecca, the city houses a number of museums, historic buildings, an array of colleges and universities, and a large student population. In recognition of the cultural and linguistic diversity found not only in Mayagüez but in Puerto Rico as a whole, the Center adopted both Spanish and English as official languages. Though students primarily speak Spanish, they are expected to have adequate reading, writing, and conversational skills in English as well. On occasion, if enough students express interest, teachers will instruct entire classes in English.

== Academics ==
Ranked as one of the nation’s top Hispanic-serving institutions specializing in human behavior science, Albizu attracts a student body committed to preparing themselves to work in community-oriented fields. With curriculums carefully designed to promote cultural sensitivity in today’s diverse society, students are able to choose from over 30 degree and certificate programs, with the largest number of offerings being in the field of psychology.

=== Psychology Program ===
Over half of the programs offered at Albizu are for degrees in psychology, and students are able to select from certificate, undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs with a wide range of specializations that include marriage and family therapy, mental health counseling, school counseling, industrial/organizational psychology, child psychology, and clinical psychology.

When Albizu was founded in the late 1960s, Dr. Albizu-Miranda’s blueprint was to create a school offering a master’s degree in clinical psychology that would foster the development of therapeutic processes sensitive to cultural and class differences. At first, there were only 20 students and a handful of teachers committed to the pioneer institution. Over time, the clinical psychology program gained momentum and became the inaugural program at all three locations. To this day, it continues to be the most extensive program that Albizu offers.

Today, all of the psychology programs emphasize cultural and ethnic sensitivity, in recognition of Albizu’s origins as an institution built on the belief that a multicultural society is best served by professionals who are culturally competent and inclusive. In the classroom, where a majority of the professors are practicing mental health professionals, students are taught the intricacies of a multicultural society from the real-world experience and examples provided by their professors. Outside of the classroom, students gain hands-on exposure at over 100 practicum sites that between them offer experience with a wide range of psychological disorders and clinical environments.

==Student life==
Albizu University has numerous clubs and organizations to encourage student involvement in larger communities. Opportunities range from organizations exclusive to Albizu, such as the Student Council, to associations that operate on a national or international level and welcome Albizu students to participate as campus representatives.

Of the clubs and organizations offered to Albizu students, there is a fairly even balance between those hosted by the university and those that represent outside associations. Of the outside associations, some of the most notable with chapters at Albizu include The [[American Psychological Association of Graduate Students]] (APAGS), The Society for Military Psychology, and The International Honor Society in Psychology: [[Psi Chi]]. All offer students the opportunity to have a voice on a national to international level and to advocate on behalf of the science and practice of psychology through events including panel discussions, fundraisers, and walks to raise awareness for different causes such as suicide amongst veterans.

=== Student Clubs and Organizations ===

Web. 1 Apr. 2016" /&gt;'''Classroom management''' is a term [[teacher|teachers]] use to describe the process of ensuring that classroom [[lesson|lessons]] run smoothly without [[Challenging behavior|disruptive behavior]] from [[student|students]] compromising the delivery of instruction. The term also implies the prevention of disruptive behavior  preemptively, as well as effectively responding to it after it happens.

It is a difficult aspect of teaching for many teachers. Problems in this area causes some to leave teaching. In 1981 the US [[National Educational Association]] reported that 36% of teachers said they would probably not go into teaching if they had to decide again. A major reason was negative student attitudes and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1  = Wolfgang | first1 = Charles H | last2 = Glickman  | first2 = Carl D  |title=Solving Discipline Problems |url= |accessdate= |year= 1986 |publisher= Allyn and Bacon |location= |isbn=0205086306 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classroom management is crucial in classrooms because it supports the proper execution of curriculum development, developing best teaching practices, and putting them into action. Classroom management can be explained as the actions and directions that teachers use to create a successful learning environment; indeed, having a positive impact on students achieving given learning requirements and goals (Soheili, Alizadeh, Murphy, Bajestani, Ferguson and Dreikurs). In an effort to ensure all students receive the best education it would seem beneficial for educator programs to spend more time and effort in ensuring educators and instructors are well versed in classroom management. 

Teachers do not focus on learning classroom management, because higher education programs do not put an emphasis on the teacher attaining classroom management; indeed, the focus is on creating a conducive learning atmosphere for the student (Eisenman, Edwards, and Cushman). These tools enable teachers to have the resources available to properly and successfully educate upcoming generations, and ensure future successes as a nation.
According to Moskowitz &amp; Hayman (1976), once a teacher loses control of their classroom, it becomes increasingly more difficult for them to regain that control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moskowitz |first1=G. |last2=Hayman Jr. |first2=J.L. |year=1976 |title=Success strategies of inner-city teachers: A year-long study |journal=Journal of Educational Research |volume=69 |issue=8 |pages=283–289 |publisher= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Also, research from Berliner (1988) and Brophy &amp; Good (1986) shows that the time a teacher must take to correct misbehavior caused by poor classroom management skills results in a lower rate of academic engagement in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner, D. C. (1988). Effective classroom management and instruction: A knowledge base for consultation. In J. L. Graden, J. E. Zins, &amp; M. J. Curtis (Eds.), Alternative educational delivery systems: Enhancing instructional options for all students (pp.&amp;nbsp;309–325). Washington, DC: National Association of School Psychologists.Brophy, J. E., &amp; Good, T. L. (1986). Teacher behavior and student achievement. In M. C. Wittrock (Ed.), Handbook of research on teaching (3rd ed., pp.&amp;nbsp;328–375). New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; From the student's perspective, effective classroom management involves clear communication of behavioral and academic expectations as well as a cooperative learning environment.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, J.D. (1986). Classroom management: students' perspectives, goals, and strategies. American Educational Research Journal, 23, 437-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporal punishment===
{{seealso|School corporal punishment}}
Until recently, [[corporal punishment]] was widely used as a means of controlling disruptive behavior but it is now illegal in most schools. It is still advocated in some contexts by religious leaders such as [[James Dobson]], but his views "diverge sharply from those recommended by contemporary mainstream experts" and are not based on empirical testing, but rather are a reflection of his faith-based beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartkowski|first1=John P.|last2=Ellison|first2=Christopher G.|title=Divergent Models of Childrearing in Popular Manuals: Conservative Protestants vs. the Mainstream Experts|journal=Sociology of Religion 56|date=1995|volume=1|pages=21–34|doi=10.2307/3712036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to studies taboo physical punishments like spanking or procedures used in Asia in the classroom such as standing do not make students or children more aggressive. Consistency seems to play a greater role on whether outcomes could be negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Truth About Physically Punishing Children {{!}} ESLinsider|url = http://www.eslinsider.com/blog/truth-about-physically-punishing-children-and-students|website = www.eslinsider.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporal punishment is now banned in most schools in the [[United States]], and most [[developed countries]]. Although its effectiveness was never proven, the punishment was very disproportionately met. African American males were the most punished group. In a study conducted in 2006, 17.1 percent of students who experienced corporal punishment were African Americans, and 78.3 percent of total students were males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/10/23/09spanking_ep.h33.html|title=Corporal Punishment Persists in U.S. Schools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Good teacher-student relationships===

Some characteristics of having good teacher-student relationships in the classroom involves the appropriate levels of dominance, cooperation, and awareness of high-needs students. Dominance is defined as the teacher's ability to give clear purpose and guidance concerning student behavior and their academics. By creating and giving clear expectations and consequences for student behavior, this builds effective relationships. Such expectations may cover classroom etiquette and behavior, group work, seating arrangements, the use of equipment and materials, and also classroom disruptions. Assertive teacher behavior also reassures that thoughts and messages are being passed on to the student in an effective way. Assertive behavior can be achieved by using erect posture, appropriate tone of voice depending on the current situation, and taking care not to ignore inappropriate behavior by taking action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marzano|first1=Robert J.|title=The Key to Classroom Management|journal=Educational Leadership|date=September 2003|volume=61|issue=1|pages=6–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventive techniques===

Preventive approaches to classroom management involve creating a positive classroom community with mutual respect between teacher and student. Teachers using the preventive approach offer warmth, acceptance, and support unconditionally – not based on a student's behavior. Fair rules and consequences are established and students are given frequent and consistent feedback regarding their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bear, G.G. (2008). Best practices in classroom discipline. In Thomas, A. &amp; Grimes, J. (Eds.), Best Practices in School Psychology V (1403-1420). Bethesda, MD: National Association of School Psychologists&lt;/ref&gt; One way to establish this kind of classroom environment is through the development and use of a classroom contract.  The contract should be created by both students and the teacher.  In the contract, students and teachers decide and agree on how to treat one another in the classroom. The group also decides on and agrees to what the group will do if someone violates the contract.  Rather than a consequence, the group should decide how to fix the problem through either class discussion, peer mediation, counseling, or by one on one conversations leading to a solution to the situation.

Preventive techniques also involve the strategic use of praise and rewards to inform students about their behavior rather than as a means of controlling student behavior. To use rewards to inform students about their behavior, teachers must emphasize the value of the behavior that is rewarded and also explain to students the specific skills they demonstrated to earn the reward. Teachers should also encourage student collaboration in selecting rewards and defining appropriate behaviors that earn rewards.&lt;ref&gt;Bear, G.G., Cavalier, A., &amp; Manning, M. (2005). Developing self-discipline and preventing and correcting misbehavior. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rote discipline ===
Also known as "lines", rote discipline is a sanction used for [[behavior management]]. It involves assigning a disorderly student sentences or the classroom rules to write repeatedly. Among the many types of classroom management approaches, it is very commonly used.

==Systematic approaches==

=== Assertive discipline ===

[[Assertive discipline]] is an approach designed to assist educators in running a teacher-in-charge classroom environment. Assertive teachers react to situations that require the management of student behavior confidently. Assertive teachers do not use an abrasive, sarcastic, or hostile tone when disciplining students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.behavioradvisor.com/AssertiveDiscipline.html|title=Assertive Discipline {{!}} Child Discipline in the Classroom|website=www.behavioradvisor.com|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Assertive discipline is one of the most widely used classroom management tactics in the world. It demands student compliance and requires teachers to be firm. This method draws a clear line between aggressive discipline and assertive discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.behavioradvisor.com/AssertiveDiscipline.html|title=Assertive Discipline|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards and rules set in place by assertive discipline are supported by positive reinforcement as well as negative consequences. Teachers using this approach carry themselves confidently and have no tolerance for class disruption. They are not timid, and remain consistent and just.&lt;ref&gt;"Lee Canter's assertive discipline; positive behavior management for today's classroom, 4th ed."&amp;nbsp;''Reference &amp; Research Book News'', Feb. 2010.&amp;nbsp;''Academic OneFile'',&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A224421968/AONE?u=txshracd2575&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=ab58f676&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 11 Dec. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructivist discipline ===

A constructivist, student-centered approach to classroom management is based on the assignment of tasks in response to student disruption that are "(1) easy for the student to perform, (2) developmentally enriching, (3) progressive, so a teacher can up the ante if needed, (4) based on students' interests, (5) designed to allow the teacher to stay in charge, and (6) foster creativity and play in the classroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helman|first1=Daniel|title=Constructivist Discipline for a Student-Centered Classroom|url=https://www.academia.edu/35104244/Constructivist_Discipline_for_a_Student-Centered_Classroom|website=Academia.edu|publisher=Academic Exchange Quarterly|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compliance rests on assigning disciplinary tasks that the student will want to do, in concert with the teacher rapidly assigning more of the task if the student does not initially comply. Once the student complies, the role of the teacher as the person in charge (i.e. in loco parentis) has been re-established peacefully, creatively, and with respect for students' needs. Claimed benefits include increased student trust and long-term emotional benefits from the modeling of creative solutions to difficulties without resorting to a threat of violence or force.

=== Culturally responsive classroom management ===

Culturally responsive classroom management (CRCM) is an approach to running classrooms with all children [not simply for racial/ethnic minority children] in a culturally responsive way. More than a set of strategies or practices, CRCM is a pedagogical approach that guides the management decisions that teachers make.  It is a natural extension of culturally responsive teaching, which uses students' backgrounds, rendering of social experiences, prior knowledge, and learning styles in daily lessons. Teachers, as culturally responsive classroom managers, recognize their biases
and values and reflect on how these influence their expectations for behavior and their interactions with students as well as what learning looks like. There is extensive research on traditional classroom management and a myriad of resources available on how to deal with behavior issues.  Conversely, there is little research on CRCM, despite the fact that teachers who lack cultural competence often experience problems in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culturally Responsive Classroom Management Strategies|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/005/121/Culturally%20Responsive%20Classroom%20Mgmt%20Strat2.pdf|website=www.steinhardt.nyu.edu/metrocenter|publisher=Metropolitan Center for Urban Education|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discipline without Stress, Punishments or Rewards ===

Discipline without Stress (or DWS) is a K-12 discipline and learning approach developed by Marvin Marshall described in his 2001 book, ''Discipline without Stress, Punishments or Rewards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Marvin|title=Discipline without Stress, Punishments or Rewards|year=2001|publisher=Piper Press|location=Los Alamitos|isbn=0-9700606-1-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach is designed to educate young people about the value of internal motivation.   The intention is to prompt and develop within youth a desire to become responsible and self-disciplined and to put forth effort to learn. The most significant characteristics of DWS are that it is totally noncoercive (but not permissive) and takes the opposite approach to Skinnerian behaviorism that relies on external sources for reinforcement.

=== Provide flexible learning goals ===

Instructors can demonstrate a suitable level of strength by giving clear learning objectives, they can also pass on fitting levels of participation by giving learning objectives that can be changed based on the classes needs. Allowing students to participate in their own learning goals and outcomes at the start of a unit brings a sense of cooperation and mutual understanding between the instructor and student. One way of involving the students and in turn making them feel heard in the decision making of the class is by asking what topics they would find most intriguing in learning based on a guided rubric. This approach will engage and send a message to the students that the teacher is interested in the student's interests. The student in turn will bring greater learning outcomes as well as a mutual respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept03/vol61/num01/The-Key-to-Classroom-Management.aspx|title=Educational Leadership:Building Classroom Relationships:The Key to Classroom Management|first=|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== The Good Behavior Game ===

The Good Behavior Game (GBG) is a "classroom-level approach to behavior management"&lt;ref&gt;Responding to rule violations or rule following: A comparison of two versions of the Good Behavior Game with kindergarten students. Journal of School Psychology, 48, 337-355.&lt;/ref&gt; that was originally used in 1969 by Barrish, Saunders, and Wolf. The Game entails the class earning access to a reward or losing a reward, given that all members of the class engage in some type of behavior (or did not exceed a certain amount of undesired behavior). The GBG can be used to increase desired behaviors (e.g., question asking) or to decrease undesired behaviors (e.g., out of seat behavior). The GBG has been used with preschoolers as well as adolescents, however most applications have been used with typically developing students (i.e., those without developmental disabilities). In addition, the Game "is usually popular with and acceptable to students and teachers."&lt;ref&gt;Tingstrom, D.H., Sterling-Turner, H.E., Wilczynski, S.M. (2006). The Good Behavior Game: 1969-2002. Behavior Modification, 30, 2, 225-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive classrooms ===
[[Robert DiGiulio]] has developed what he calls "[[positive classrooms]]". DiGiulio sees positive classroom management as the result of four factors: how teachers regard their students (spiritual dimension), how they set up the classroom environment (physical dimension), bow skillfully they teach content (instructional dimension), and how well they address student behavior (managerial dimension). In positive classrooms student participation and collaboration are encouraged in a safe environment that has been created. A positive classroom environment can be encouraged by being consistent with expectations, using students' names, providing choices when possible, and having an overall trust in students. So As educators, we have daily opportunities to help students grow confidence and feel good about themselves. Despite all the negativity that may be around them within their households. Through such actions as boosting their self-esteem through praise, helping them work through any feelings of alienation, depression, and anger, and helping them realize and honor their intrinsic worth as human beings. May result in better behavior in the long line jeopardy of the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/15923.htm|title=Feeling Good About Themselves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lucero|first1=Rodrick|title=Building a Positive Classroom Culture and Climate|url=http://teaching.colostate.edu/tips/tip.cfm?tipid=136|website=Teaching @ CSU|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a process==

In the ''Handbook of Classroom Management: Research Practice and Contemporary Issues'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinstein|first=edited by Carolyn M. Evertson ; Carol S.|title=Handbook of classroom management : research, practice, and contemporary issues|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, N.J|isbn=0-8058-4753-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evertson and Weinstein characterize classroom management as the actions taken to create an environment that supports and facilitates academic and social–emotional learning.  Toward this goal, teachers must (1) develop caring, supportive relationships with and among students; (2) organize and implement instruction in ways that optimize students’ access to learning; (3) use group management methods that encourage students’ engagement in academic tasks; (4) promote the development of students’ social skills and self–regulation; and (5) use appropriate interventions to assist students with behavior problems.

==As time management==

In their introductory text on teaching, Kauchak and Eggen (2008)&lt;ref&gt; Kauchak, D., and Eggen, P. (2008). Introduction to teaching: Becoming a professional (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; explain classroom management in terms of time management. The goal of classroom management, to Kauchak and Eggen, is to not only maintain order but to optimize student learning. They divide class time into four overlapping categories, namely allocated time, instructional time, engaged time, and academic learning time.

===Academic learning time===

Academic learning time occurs when students 1) participate actively and 2) are successful in learning activities. Effective classroom management maximizes academic learning time.

=== Allocated time ===
Allocated time is the total time allotted for [[teaching]], [[learning]], routine classroom procedures, checking attendance, and posting or delivering announcements.

Allocated time is also what appears on each student's schedule, for example "[[Introductory Algebra]]: 9:50-10:30 a.m." or "[[Fine Arts]] 1:15-2:00 p.m."

===Engaged time===

Engaged time is also called time on task. During engaged time, students are participating actively in learning activities—asking and responding to questions, completing worksheets and exercises, preparing skits and presentations, etc.

===Instructional time===

Instructional time is what remains after routine classroom procedures are completed. That is to say, instructional time is the time wherein teaching and learning actually takes place. Teachers may spend two or three minutes taking attendance, for example, before their instruction begins. The time it takes for the teacher to do routine tasks can severely limit classroom instruction. Teachers must get a handle on classroom management to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teachers: Classroom Management Plan|url = http://teachersindex.com/classroommanagement.html|website = teachersindex.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common mistakes==

In an effort to maintain order in the classroom, sometimes teachers can actually make the problems worse. Therefore, it is important to consider some of the basic mistakes commonly made when implementing classroom behavior management strategies. For example, a common mistake made by teachers is to define the problem behavior by how it looks without considering its function.&lt;ref name="barbetta2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barbetta|first=Patricia M.|author2=Norona, Kathleen Leong |author3=Bicard, David F. |title=Classroom Behavior Management: A Dozen Common Mistakes and What to Do Instead|journal=Preventing School Failure: Alternative Education for Children and Youth|year=2005|volume=49|issue=3|pages=11–19|doi=10.3200/PSFL.49.3.11-19|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/PSFL.49.3.11-19|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interventions are more likely to be effective when they are individualized to address the specific function of the problem behavior. Two students with similar looking misbehavior may require entirely different intervention strategies if the behaviors are serving different functions. Teachers need to understand that they need to be able to change the ways they do things from year to year, as the children change. Not every approach works for every child. Teachers need to learn to be flexible. Another common mistake is for the teacher to become increasingly frustrated and negative when an approach is not working.&lt;ref name="barbetta2005" /&gt;

The teacher may raise his or her voice or increase adverse consequences in an effort to make the approach work. This type of interaction may impair the teacher-student relationship. Instead of allowing this to happen, it is often better to simply try a new approach.

Inconsistency in expectations and consequences is an additional mistake that can lead to dysfunction in the classroom.&lt;ref name="barbetta2005" /&gt; Teachers must be consistent in their expectations and consequences to help ensure that students understand that rules will be enforced. To avoid this, teachers should communicate expectations to students clearly and be sufficiently committed to the classroom management procedures to enforce them consistently.

"Ignoring and approving" is an effective classroom management strategy. This involves ignoring students when they behave undesirably and approving their behavior when it is desirable. When students are praised for their good behavior but ignored for their bad behavior, this may increase the frequency of good behavior and decrease bad behavior. Student behavior may be maintained by attention; if students have a history of getting attention after misbehavior, they may continue this behavior as long as it continues to get attention. If student misbehavior is ignored, but good behavior results in attention, students may instead behave appropriately to acquire attention.&lt;ref name=Madesen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madesen|first1=Charles|title=Rules, Praise, And Ignoring:  Elements Of Elementary Classroom Control|journal=Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1968|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~educy520/sec5982/week_8/madsen68.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] defines '''community development''' as "a process where community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems."&lt;ref name="unterm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community development|url=http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/526c2eaba978f007852569fd00036819?OpenDocument|website=UNTERM|accessdate=7 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714225617/http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/526c2eaba978f007852569fd00036819?OpenDocument|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a broad term given to the practices of civic leaders, activists, involved citizens and professionals to improve various aspects of communities, typically aiming to build stronger and more resilient local communities.

Community development is also understood as a professional discipline, and is defined by the International Association for Community Development (www.iacdglobal.org), the global network of community development practitioners and scholars, as "a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes participative democracy, sustainable development, rights, economic opportunity, equality and social justice, through the organisation, education and empowerment of people within their communities, whether these be of locality, identity or interest, in urban and rural settings".

Community development seeks to empower individuals and groups of people with the skills they need to effect change within their communities. These skills are often created through the formation of social groups working for a common agenda. Community developers must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger [[Social organization|social institutions]].

''Community development'' as a term has taken off widely in anglophone countries i.e. the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] and other countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is also used in some countries in [[Eastern Europe]] with active community development associations in [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]]. The ''Community Development Journal'', published by [[Oxford University Press]], since 1966 has aimed to be the major forum for research and dissemination of international community development theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Development Journal- about the journal|url=http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/cdj/about.html|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community development approaches are recognised internationally. These methods and approaches have been acknowledged as significant for local social, economic, cultural, environmental and political development by such organisations as the UN, WHO, OECD, World Bank, Council of Europe and EU.

== Definitions ==
There are complementary definitions of community development.

The United Nations defines ''community development'' broadly as "a process where community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems."&lt;ref name="unterm" /&gt; and the International Association for Community Development defines it as both a practice based profession and an academic discipline. Following the adoption of the IACD definition in 2016, the association has gone on to produce International Standards for Community Development Practice.  The values and ethos that should underpin practice; these can be expressed as:Commitment to rights, solidarity, democracy, equality, environmental and social justice. The purpose of community development is understood by IACD as being to work with communities to achieve participative democracy, sustainable development, rights, economic opportunity, equality and social justice. This practice is carried out by people in different roles and contexts, including people explicitly called professional community
workers (and people taking on essentially the same role but with a different job title), together with professionals in other occupations ranging from social work, adult education, youth work, health disciplines, environmental education, local economic development, to urban planning, regeneration, architecture and more who seek to apply community development values and adopt community development methods. Community development practice also encompasses a range of occupational settings and levels from development roles working with communities, through to managerial and strategic community planning roles.

The Community Development Challenge report, which was produced by a working party comprising leading UK organizations in the field (including the (now defunct) [[Community Development Foundation]], the (now defunct) [[Community Development Exchange]] and the [[Federation for Community Development Learning]]) defines community development as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A set of values and practices which plays a special role in overcoming poverty and disadvantage, knitting society together at [[Grassroots democracy|the grass roots]] and deepening democracy. There is a community development profession, defined by national occupational standards and a body of theory and experience going back the best part of a century. There are active citizens who use community development techniques on a voluntary basis, and there are also other professions and agencies which use a community development approach or some aspects of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdf.org.uk/SITE/UPLOAD/DOCUMENT/communitydevelopmentchallenge.pdf |title=Community Development Challenge Report |accessdate=2009-02-13 |publisher=Produced by Community Development Foundation for Communities and Local Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Community Development Exchange defines community development as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;both an occupation (such as a community development worker in a local authority) and a way of working with communities. Its key purpose is to build communities based on justice, equality and mutual respect.
Community development involves changing the relationships between ordinary people and people in positions of power, so that everyone can take part in the issues that affect their lives. It starts from the principle that within any community there is a wealth of knowledge and experience which, if used in creative ways, can be channeled into collective action to achieve the communities' desired goals.
Community development practitioners work alongside people in communities to help build relationships with key people and organizations and to identify common concerns. They create opportunities for the community to learn new skills and, by enabling people to act together, community development practitioners help to foster social inclusion and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdx.org.uk/community-development/what-community-development |title=Definition of CD |accessdate=2010-06-08 |publisher=Community Development Exchange |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714160130/http://www.cdx.org.uk/community-development/what-community-development |archivedate=2010-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Different approaches ==
There are numerous overlapping approaches to community development. Some focus on the processes, some on the outcomes/ objectives. They include:
* '''[[Community Engagement]]'''; focuses on relationships at the core of facilitating "understanding and evaluation, involvement, exchange of information and opinions, about a concept, issue or project, with the aim of building social capital and enhancing social outcomes through decision-making” (p. 173).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, K. A., Lane, A. B., Devin, B., &amp; Beatson, A. (2018). Episodic and Relational Community Engagement: Implications for Social Impact and Social License. In K. A. Johnston &amp; M. Taylor (Eds.), The Handbook of Communication Engagement (pp. 169-185). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. https://www.wiley.com/en-au/The+Handbook+of+Communication+Engagement-p-9781119167495&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Self-help|Women Self-help Group]]'''; focusing on the contribution of women in settlement groups.&lt;ref&gt;Chigbu, UE. (2015). Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community. Community, Work &amp; Family, 18, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13668803.2014.981506#.VSmVekI2nFK&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Community [[capacity building]]'''; focusing on helping communities obtain, strengthen, and maintain the ability to set and achieve their own development objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations Development Group|title=United Nations Development System- A Collective Approach to Supporting Capacity Development|url=http://www.undg.org/docs/8948/Capacity-Development-UNDG-August-2009.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209130601/http://undg.org/docs/8948/Capacity-Development-UNDG-August-2009.pdf|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Large Group Capacitation]]'''; an adult education and social psychology approach grounded in the activity  of the individual and the social psychology of the large group focusing on large groups of unemployed or semi-employed participants, many of whom with Lower Levels of Literacy (LLLs).
* '''[[Social capital]] formation'''; focusing on benefits derived from the cooperation between individuals and groups.
* '''[[Direct Action|Nonviolent direct action]]'''; when a group of people take action to reveal an existing problem, highlight an alternative, or demonstrate a possible solution to a social issue which is not being addressed through traditional societal institutions (governments, religious organizations or established trade unions) are not addressing to the satisfaction of the direct action participants.
* '''[[Economic development]]''', focusing on the "development" of [[developing countries]] as measured by their economies, although it includes the processes and policies by which a nation improves the economic, political, and social well-being of its people.
* '''[[Community economic development]]''' (CED); an alternative to conventional [[economic development]] which encourages using local resources in a way that enhances economic outcomes while improving social conditions. For example, CED involves strategies which aim to improve access to affordable housing, medical, and child care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clay|first=Roger A.|last2=Jones|first2=Susan R.|date=2009|title=A Brief History of Community Economic Development|jstor=25782846|journal=Journal of Affordable Housing &amp; Community Development Law|volume=18|issue=3|pages=257–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A [[worker cooperative]] is a progressive CED strategy that operates as businesses both managed and owned by their employees. They are beneficial due to their potential to create jobs and providing a route for grassroots political action. Some challenges that the worker cooperative faces include the mending of the cooperative’s identity as both business and as a democratic humanitarian organization. They are limited in resources and scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krishna|first=Gowri J.|date=2013|title=Worker Cooperative Creation As Progressive Lawyering?

* '''[[Community-driven development]]''' (CDD), an [[economic development]] model which shifts overreliance on central governments to local communities.
* '''[[Asset-based community development]]''' (ABCD); is a methodology that seeks to uncover and use the strengths within communities as a means for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathie|first1=Alison &amp; Cunningham, Gord|title=From clients to citizens: Asset-based Community Development as a strategy for community-driven development|journal=Development in Practice|date=1 Jul 2010|volume=13|issue=5|pages=474–486|doi=10.1080/0961452032000125857|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0961452032000125857#.U8EljpMya8A|accessdate=12 July 2014|citeseerx=10.1.1.613.1286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Methodologies focusing on the educational component of community development, including the community-wide empowerment that increased educational opportunity creates.
* Methodologies addressing the issues and challenges of the [[Digital divide]], making affordable training and access to computers and the Internet, addressing the marginalisation of local communities that cannot connect and participate in the global [[Online community]]. In the United States, nonprofit organizations such as [[Per Scholas|''Per'' Scholas]] seek to “break the cycle of poverty by providing education, technology and economic opportunities to individuals, families and communities” as a path to development for the communities they serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Per Scholas Website|url=http://www.perscholas.org/recovery/|accessdate=July 6, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184826/http://perscholas.org/recovery/|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a myriad of job titles for community development workers and their employers include public authorities and voluntary or non-governmental organisations, funded by the state and by independent grant making bodies. Since the nineteen seventies the prefix word 'community' has also been adopted by several other occupations from the police and health workers to planners and architects, who have been influenced by community development approaches.

== History ==
Amongst the earliest community development approaches were those developed in Kenya and British East Africa during the 1930s. Community development practitioners have over many years developed a range of approaches for working within local communities and in particular with disadvantaged people. Since the nineteen sixties and seventies through the various anti poverty programmes in both developed and developing countries, community development practitioners have been influenced by structural analyses as to the causes of disadvantage and poverty i.e. inequalities in the distribution of wealth, income, land, etc. and especially political power and the need to mobilise people power to affect social change. Thus the influence of such educators as [[Paulo Freire]] and his focus upon this work. Other key people who have influenced this field are [[Saul Alinsky]] ([[Rules for Radicals]]) and [[E.F. Schumacher]] (''[[Small is Beautiful]]'').  There are a number of international organisations that support community development, for example, [[Oxfam]], [[UNICEF]], [[The Hunger Project]] and Freedom from Hunger, run community development programs based upon community development initiatives for relief and prevention of malnutrition.  Since 2006 the Dragon Dreaming Project Management techniques have spread to 37 different countries and are engaged in an estimated 3,250 projects worldwide.

=== In the global North ===
In the 19th century, the work of the Welsh early [[socialist]] thinker [[Robert Owen]] (1771–1851), sought to create a more perfect community.  At [[New Lanark]] and at later communities such as [[Oneida Community|Oneida]] in the USA and the [[New Australia Movement]] in Australia, groups of people came together to create [[utopian]] or [[intentional communities]], with mixed success.

==== United States ====
In the United States in the 1960s, the term "community development" began to complement and generally replace the idea of [[urban renewal]], which typically focused on physical development projects often at the expense of [[Working class|working-class]] communities. One of the earliest proponents of the term in the United States was social scientist [[William W. Biddle]]&lt;ref name="in memoriam"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00103829.1973.10877482 | volume=4 | issue=1 | title=In Memoriam: William W. Biddle | year=1973 | journal=Journal of the Community Development Society | page=5 | last1 = List | first1 = E. Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, philanthropies such as the [[Ford Foundation]] and government officials such as Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] took an interest in local nonprofit organizations. A pioneer was the [[Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation]] in Brooklyn, which attempted to apply business and management skills to the social mission of uplifting low-income residents and their neighborhoods. Eventually such groups became known as "[[Community development corporation]]s" or CDCs. Federal laws beginning with the 1974 [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1974|Housing and Community Development Act]] provided a way for state and municipal governments to channel funds to CDCs and other [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit organizations]].

National organizations such as the [[Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation]] (founded in 1978 and now known as [[NeighborWorks America]]), the [[Local Initiatives Support Corporation]] (LISC) (founded in 1980), and the [[Enterprise Foundation]] (founded in 1981) have built extensive networks of affiliated local [[nonprofit]] organizations to which they help provide financing for countless physical and [[social development]] programs in urban and [[Types of rural communities|rural communities]].  The CDCs and similar organizations have been credited with starting the process that stabilized and revived seemingly hopeless [[inner city]] areas such as [[South Bronx|the South Bronx]] in New York City.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the UK, community development has had two main traditions. The first was as an approach for preparing for the [[decolonisation|independence]] of countries from the former [[British Empire]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Domestically it first came into public prominence with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government's anti deprivation programmes of the latter sixties and seventies. The main example of this being the CDP (Community Development Programme), which piloted local area based community development. This influenced a number of largely urban local authorities, in particular in Scotland with [[Strathclyde]] Region's major community development programme (the largest at the time in Europe).

The [[Gulbenkian Foundation]] was a key funder of commissions and reports which influenced the development of community development in the UK from the latter sixties to the 80's. This included recommending that there be a national institute or centre for community development, able to support practice and to advise government and local authorities on policy. This was formally set up in 1991 as the Community Development Foundation. In 2004 the [[Carnegie United Kingdom Trust|Carnegie UK Trust]] established a Commission of Inquiry into the future of rural community development examining such issues as land reform and climate change. Carnegie funded over sixty rural community development action research projects across the UK and Ireland and national and international communities of practice to exchange experiences. This included the International Association for Community Development.

In 1999 a UK wide organisation responsible for setting professional training standards for all education and development practitioners working within local communities was established and recognised by the [[Blair ministry|Labour Government]]. This organisation was called PAULO&amp;nbsp;– the National Training Organisation for Community Learning and Development. (It was named after [[Paulo Freire]]). It was formally recognised by [[David Blunkett]], the [[Secretary of State for Education and Employment]]. Its first chair was Charlie McConnell, the Chief Executive of the [[Scottish Community Education Council]], who had played a lead role in bringing together a range of occupational interests under a single national training standards body, including [[community education]], community development and development education. The inclusion of community development was significant as it was initially uncertain as to whether it would join the NTO for Social Care. The Community Learning and Development NTO represented all the main employers, trades unions, professional associations and national development agencies working in this area across the four nations of the UK.

The term 'community learning and development' was adopted to acknowledge that all of these occupations worked primarily within local communities, and that this work encompassed not just providing less formal learning support but also a concern for the wider holistic development of those communities&amp;nbsp;– socio-economically, environmentally, culturally and politically. By bringing together these occupational groups this created for the first time a single recognised employment sector of nearly 300,000 full and part-time paid staff within the UK, approximately 10% of these staff being full-time. The NTO continued to recognise the range of different occupations within it, for example specialists who work primarily with young people, but all agreed that they shared a core set of professional approaches to their work. In 2002 the NTO became part of a wider Sector Skills Council for lifelong learning.

The UK currently hosts the only global network of practitioners and activists working towards social justice through community development approach, the International Association for Community Development (IACD).&lt;ref name=IACD&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association for Community Development|url=http://www.iacdglobal.org/|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IACD was formed in the USA in 1953, moved to Belgium in 1978 and was restructured and relaunched in Scotland in 1999.&lt;ref name=IACDhistory&gt;{{cite web|title=IACD- a brief history|url=http://www.iacdglobal.org/iacd-brief-history|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
Community development in Canada has roots in the development of co-operatives, [[credit union]]s and caisses populaires. The [[Antigonish Movement]] which started in the 1920s in [[Nova Scotia]], through the work of Doctor [[Moses Coady]] and Father [[Jimmy Tompkins (priest)|James Tompkins]], has been particularly influential in the subsequent expansion of community economic development work across Canada.

==== Australia ====
Community development in Australia have often been focussed upon Aboriginal Australian communities, and during the period of the 1980s to the early 21st century were funded through the Community Employment Development Program, where Aboriginal people could be employed in "a work for the dole" scheme, which gave the chance for non-government organisations to apply for a full or part-time worker funded by the Department for Social Security.  Dr Jim Ife, formerly of [[Curtin University]], organised a ground breaking text-book on community development

=== In the "Global South" ===
Community planning techniques drawing on the history of utopian movements became important in the 1920s and 1930s in [[Eastern Africa|East Africa]], where community development proposals were seen as a way of helping local people improve their own lives with indirect assistance from colonial authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David|date=1984|title=Depression, Dust Bowl, Demography, and Drought: The Colonial State and Soil Conservation in East Africa during the 1930s|jstor=722351|journal=African Affairs|volume=83|issue=332|pages=321–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]] adopted African community development ideals as a basis of his South African Ashram, and then introduced it as a part of the Indian [[Swaraj]] movement, aiming at establishing [[economic interdependence]] at village level throughout India.  With [[Partition of India|Indian independence]], despite the continuing work of [[Vinoba Bhave]] in encouraging [[grassroots]] [[land reform]], India under its first Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] adopted a mixed-economy approach, mixing elements of socialism and capitalism. During the fifties and sixties, India ran a massive community development programme with focus on rural development activities through government support. This was later expanded in scope and was called integrated rural development scheme [IRDP]. A large number of initiatives that can come under the community development umbrella have come up in recent years.

The main objective of community development in India remains to develop the villages and to help the villagers help themselves to fight against poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, etc. The beauty of Indian model of community development lies in the homogeneity of villagers and high level of participation.

Community development became a part of the [[Arusha Declaration|Ujamaa Villages]] established in [[Tanzania]] by [[Julius Nyerere]], where it had some success in assisting with the delivery of education services throughout rural areas, but has elsewhere met with mixed success.  In the 1970s and 1980s, community development became a part of "Integrated Rural Development", a strategy promoted by [[United Nations]] Agencies and [[World Bank Group|the World Bank]].  Central to these policies of community development were:
* [[Literacy|Adult literacy]] programs, drawing on the work of Brazilian educator [[Paulo Freire]] and the "[[Each One Teach One]]" adult literacy teaching method conceived by [[Frank Laubach]].
* Youth and women's groups, following the work of the [[Serowe Brigades]] of [[Botswana]], of [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=ERICSearchResult&amp;_urlType=action&amp;newSearch=true&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_1=au&amp;ERICExtSearch_Operator_1=OR&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_1=%22Van+Rensburg+Patrick%22&amp;searchtype=authors|Mr Patrick van Rensburg].
* Development of [[community business ventures]] and particularly [[cooperatives]], in part drawn on the examples of [[José María Arizmendiarrieta]] and the [[Mondragón Cooperative Corporation|Mondragon Cooperatives]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] region of Spain
* [[Compensatory education]] for those missing out in the [[Education|formal education]] system, drawing on the work of [[Open educational resources|Open Education]] as pioneered by [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]].
* Dissemination of [[Alternative technology|alternative technologies]], based upon the work of [[E. F. Schumacher]] as advocated in his book ''[[Small is Beautiful]]: Economics as if people really mattered''
* Village nutrition programs and [[permaculture]] projects, based upon the work of Australians [[Bill Mollison]] and [[David Holmgren]].
* [[water resources|Village water supply]] programs

In the 1990s, following critiques of the mixed success of "top down" government programs, and drawing on the work of [[Robert Putnam]], in the rediscovery of [[social capital]], community development internationally became concerned with social capital formation.  In particular the outstanding success of the work of [[Muhammad Yunus]] in [[Bangladesh]] with the [[Grameen Bank]] from its inception in 1976, has led to the attempts to spread [[Microcredit|microenterprise credit]] schemes around the world. Yunus saw that social problems like poverty and disease were not being solved by the market system on its own. Thus, he established a banking system which lends to the poor with very little interest, allowing them access to entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gebremariam|first=Yilma|date=2010|title=Review of Small Loans, Big Dreams: How the Nobel Prize Winner Muhammad Yunus and Microfinance Are Changing the World|jstor=20642514|journal=Eastern Economic Journal|volume=36|issue=1|pages=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was honoured by the 2006 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

Another alternative to "top down" government programs is the participatory government institution. Participatory governance institutions are organizations which aim to facilitate the participation of citizens within larger decision making and action implementing processes in society. A case study done on municipal councils and social housing programs in Brazil found that the presence of participatory governance institutions supports the implementation of poverty alleviation programs by local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donaghy|first=Maureen M.|date=2011|title=Do Participatory Governance Institutions Matter? Municipal Councils and Social Housing Programs in Brazil|jstor=23040659|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=44|issue=1|pages=83–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[human scale development]]" work of [[Right Livelihood Award]]-winning Chilean economist [[Manfred Max Neef]] promotes the idea of development based upon fundamental human needs, which are considered to be limited, universal and invariant to all human beings (being a part of our human condition).  He considers that [[poverty]] results from the failure to satisfy a particular human need, it is not just an absence of money.  Whilst human needs are limited, Max Neef shows that the ways of satisfying human needs is potentially unlimited.  Satisfiers also have different characteristics: they can be violators or destroyers, pseudosatisfiers, inhibiting satisfiers, singular satisfiers, or synergic satisfiers. Max-Neef shows that certain satisfiers, promoted as satisfying a particular need, in fact inhibit or destroy the possibility of satisfying other needs: e.g., the [[arms race]], while ostensibly satisfying the need for protection, in fact then destroys subsistence, participation, affection and freedom; [[representative democracy|formal democracy]], which is supposed to meet the need for participation often disempowers and [[social alienation|alienates]]; commercial [[television]], while used to satisfy the need for [[recreation]], interferes with understanding, creativity and identity.  [[Synergy|Synergic]] satisfiers, on the other hand, not only satisfy one particular need, but also lead to satisfaction in other areas: some examples are [[breastfeeding]]; self-managed production; [[popular education]]; democratic [[community organization]]s; [[Preventive medicine|preventative medicine]]; meditation; educational games.

==== Vietnam ====
International organizations apply the term community in Vietnam to the local administrative unit, each with a traditional identity based on traditional, cultural, and kinship relations.&lt;ref name="Yen 329–340"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yen|first=N. T. K.|last2=Luong|first2=P.

Social and economic development planning (SDEP) in Vietnam uses top-down centralized planning methods and decision-making processes which do not consider local context and local participation. The plans created by SDEP are ineffective and serve mainly for administrative purposes. Local people are not informed of these development plans.&lt;ref name="Yen 329–340"/&gt; The [[participatory rural appraisal]] (PRA) approach, a research methodology that allows local people to share and evaluate their own life conditions, was introduced to Vietnam in the early 1990s to help reform the way that government approaches local communities and development. [[Participatory rural appraisal|PRA]] was used as a tool for mostly outsiders to learn about the local community, which did not effect substantial change.&lt;ref name="academic.oup.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yen|first=N.

The village/[[commune]] development (VDP/CDP) approach was developed as a more fitting approach than [[Participatory rural appraisal|PRA]] to analyze local context and address the needs of rural communities.&lt;ref name="Yen 329–340"/&gt; VDP/CDP participatory planning is centered around Ho Chi Minh's saying that "People know, people discuss and people supervise."&lt;ref name="academic.oup.com"/&gt; VDP/CDP is often useful in Vietnam for shifting centralized management to more decentralization, helping develop local governance at the grassroots level.&lt;ref name="academic.oup.com"/&gt; Local people use their knowledge to solve local issues.&lt;ref name="academic.oup.com"/&gt; They create mid-term and yearly plans that help improve existing community development plans with the support of government organizations.&lt;ref name="academic.oup.com"/&gt; Although VDP/CDP has been tested in many regions in Vietnam, it has not been fully implemented for a couple reasons.&lt;ref name="academic.oup.com"/&gt; The methods applied in VDP/CDP are human resource and capacity building intensive, especially at the early stages. It also requires the local people to have an "initiative-taking" attitude. People in the remote areas where VDP/CDP has been tested have mostly passive attitudes because they already receive assistance from outsiders.&lt;ref name="academic.oup.com"/&gt; There also are no sufficient monitoring practices to ensure effective plan implementation. Integrating VDP/CDP into the governmental system is difficult because the Communist Party and Central government's policies on decentralization are not enforced in reality.&lt;ref name="academic.oup.com"/&gt;

[[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO) in Vietnam, legalized in 1991, have claimed goals to develop [[civil society]], which was essentially nonexistent prior to the [[Đổi Mới]] economic reforms.&lt;ref name=":052"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Michael|date=October 1999|title=Creating Civil Society?

'''Concordia College and University''' is an entity with a primary [[Address (geography)|mailing address]] in [[Dominica]] that represents itself as a [[higher education]] institution that awards associate, bachelor's, master's and doctoral [[academic degree|degree]]s based solely on the purchaser's work and life experience, without any class attendance. Although the name is similar, Concordia College and University is not in any way affiliated with any of the regionally accredited institutions within the ten-member Concordia University System.

==Locations==
Concordia College and University has used multiple addresses.  For most of its existence it has stated that it is incorporated in Dominica,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020523125212/http://concordia-college.net/ Archive of concordia-college.net], May 23, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080702012306/http://www.concordia-college.net/ Archive of concordia-college.net], July 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=contactaddresses/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prlog.org/10226325-concordia-college-and-university-celebrates-17-years-of-serving-the-distance-learning-community.html "Concordia College and University celebrates 17 years of serving the Distance Learning Community"], PRNewswire-USNewswire.

==Accreditation==
Concordia College and University is not [[educational accreditation|accredited]] by any [[List of recognized accreditation associations of higher learning|higher education accrediting body]] recognized in the United States or most other countries where its degrees are advertised. It claims to be recognized and accredited by the governments of Indonesia and Liberia. It is recognized by UNESCO. It is accredited by the [[National Academy of Higher Education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordia-college.net/accreditation.html |title=Accreditation |publisher= concordia-college.net |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an entity that is not recognized as a higher education accreditor by the [[United States Department of Education]] or the [[Council on Higher Education Accreditation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/ |title=Institution Accreditation Database |publisher=[[United States Department of Education]] |year=2007 |first= |last= |accessdate=2007-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316125738/http://www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/ |archivedate=2007-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that several educational organizations identify as an unrecognized accreditation organization or [[accreditation mill]].&lt;ref name="CW"&gt;[http://www.credentialwatch.org/non/agencies.shtml Credential Watch]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CPEC"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080415004808/http://www.cpec.ca.gov/CollegeGuide/NonAccredited.asp Unrecognized Accreditation Agencies]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Concordia College and University was reported to be claiming accreditation by the [[Distance Graduation Accrediting Association]], which is not recognized as an accreditor by the U.S. Department of Education .&lt;ref name="Barname"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v49/i21/21a03301.htm | title=North Dakota Lawmakers Move to Bar the Use of Fake Degrees | publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date=2003-01-01 | first=Dan | last=Carnevale | accessdate = 2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concordia College and University has no primary physical address or campus.

In 2009, Concordia College and University was listed as a [[diploma mill]] by the [[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Ezell, Allen |title=Recent developments with degree mills |journal= College &amp; University Journal| number=Vol85 No 2 |year=2009| page=40 |url=http://macrao.org/Publications/Degree%20Mills%20Article%20CU%20Fall%202009.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Bear]], it has an address in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]], and gives degrees based on "life experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bear |first=John |authorlink=John Bear |author2=Mariah Bear |title=Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning |date=2003-01-01 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn= 1-58008-431-1}} page 211, 212&lt;/ref&gt; Like many [[diploma mills]], Concordia College and University uses the name of similar schools that actually have legitimate accreditation to confuse prospective students. Concordia College and University is not affiliated with any of the accredited schools within the U.S.-based [[Concordia University System]]. Schools within the Concordia System are regionally accredited and are branded as [[Concordia University System|Concordia University]], [[Concordia University System|Concordia College]], or [[Concordia University School of Law]].

In September 2004, ''The East Carolinian'', the student newspaper of [[East Carolina University]] in [[Greenville, North Carolina]] reported that "There are at least a half-dozen legitimate Concordia colleges and Concordia universities around the country. But Concordia College and University is a [[diploma mill]] that offers degrees in as little turnaround time as 12 hours."&lt;ref name="East"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070311020658/http://www.theeastcarolinian.com/media/storage/paper915/news/2004/09/30/Features/Diploma.Mills.Offer.Degrees.For.A.Price-2209285.shtml?norewrite200610282306&amp;sourcedomain Diploma mills offer degrees for a price and not much else], [[The East Carolinian]], September 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
The article noted, "The fake Concordia College and University admonishes Web surfers to 'be safe and purchase a government approved degree.' The government, it turns out, is war-torn [[Liberia]]. The school's offices are in [[Dominica]], and its U.S. mailing address is in [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands]]. Its website domain is in [[Pakistan]]."&lt;ref name="East" /&gt;

A Special Report from Matthew Kauffman in the Hartford Courant says "[l]ike other schools, Concordia touts its accreditation, so I went in search of the U.S. National Academic Higher Education Agency — which inexplicably goes by the acronym NAHED. I found the agency's website at accreditation.ga, meaning that a group whose name begins with "U.S." has a website registered in the central African country of Gabon" and that "[c]ritics say that operators of diploma mills intentionally choose names that are similar or identical to recognized schools", noting that "at least a dozen legitimate institutions throughout the country named Concordia..." &lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Matthew. "Degree of Deception: When a Doctorate is Just a Credit Card Away". Accessed June 13, 2017. http://projects.courant.com/degree-of-deception/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns by U.S. state regulators ==
The [[Oregon Office of Degree Authorization]] lists a "Concordia College and University" in its list of unaccredited degree suppliers, and notes that it is a Class B [[misdemeanor]] in [[Oregon]] to use an unlawful degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda Oregon Office of Degree Authorization]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concordia College and University also appears on a State of [[Michigan]] list of non-accredited colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="Michigan"&gt;State of Michigan, [http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf Colleges and universities not accredited by an accrediting body of the Council on Higher Education Accreditation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628214640/http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf |date=June 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the [[North Dakota Legislative Assembly]] moved forward a bill "that would punish anyone trying to use a degree from a diploma mill as a legitimate credential." In a 2003 article discussing the legislation, [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] stated that "state officials are concerned that illegitimate institutions are mimicking the names of legitimate ones," citing as an example "an entity called Concordia College &amp; University" whose name is similar to that of [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]] in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], an accredited school attended by many [[North Dakota]] students.&lt;ref name="Barname"/&gt; The article further noted that for Concordia College &amp; University "No classes or exams are required. Associate and bachelor's degrees cost $599, master's degrees $699, and doctorates $1,099, including shipping and handling, the site says, noting that degree recipients get a certified diploma and two transcripts, complete with watermarks."&lt;ref name="Barname" /&gt;

In September 2009, Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann warned residents about Concordia College and University.  Hosemann said Concordia College and University LLC has been using the secretary of state's Web site to misrepresent the organization as a licensed educational institution.  Hosemann said Concordia College is a registered limited liability corporation, but it is not accredited as an educational institution in Mississippi.  Hosemann said a cease and desist letter had been sent to Concordia demanding that it remove the false and misleading claims from the company Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msbusiness.com/blog/2009/09/hosemann-warns-of-diploma-mill-in-mississippi/ Hosemann warns of diploma mill in Mississippi] ''Mississippi Business Journal'' September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual cases ==

=== Seneca County, Ohio ===
In October 2006 a [[Seneca County, Ohio]] grand jury indicted [[John McGuire (police officer)|John McGuire]], the new police chief of [[Fostoria, Ohio]] on two [[felony]] counts of tampering with records and two [[misdemeanor]] charges of [[forgery|falsification]] involving his qualifications. The ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' noted he "obtained a criminal-justice degree from Concordia College and University, an online degree program in the Virgin Islands."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061020/NEWS03/610200332/0/NEWS13 Police chief in Fostoria accused of tampering] ''Toledo Blade.'' October 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the paper reported that documents filed in a drug case showed that Rocko, a police dog in the Fostoria police department, had also received a bachelor of science degree in criminal justice from Concordia in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Feehan and [http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070228/NEWS03/702280424 "Police dog's bachelor's degree prods legal howling about chief"], ''Toledo Blade'', February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The dog's degree was planned to be used as evidence in the court trial, but the prosecutor noted "I don't think it's necessary to bring the actual dog."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,255823,00.html| title=Dog With Online Criminal Degree May Be Use in Trial as Evidence | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=2007-03-01 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later it was revealed that the degree had been purchased by Greg Peiffer, general manager and president of Fostoria radio station [[WFOB]], who said it was obtained with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Whitta, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105630/http://www.reviewtimes.com/News/backissues/2007/Mar/ar_news_032707.asp Lawsuit threatened over alleged 'trash talk], ''Fostoria Review Times'', March 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge in the case ruled that McGuire "earned his degree", noting evidence that McGuire had helped search for bodies at the [[World Trade Center site]] after the
September 2001 terrorist attacks, had attended the [[FBI Academy]], had assisted in the search for Olympic Park bomber [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], and had served in [[Operation Desert Storm]].  With regard to the diploma awarded to the dog, the judge said that "This court finds no similarity between those two degrees."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Feehan, [http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070516/NEWS02/705160412 "Fostoria police chief is acquitted: Judge tries to clarify matters in tampering case"], ''Toledo Blade'', May 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louise Wightman===
In May 2007 [[Louise Wightman]] of [[Norwell, Massachusetts]], was convicted of [[fraud]] and [[larceny]] for misrepresenting herself as a licensed [[psychologist]] and for falsely advertising that she held a doctorate in psychology.  Part of her crime was claiming to have a Ph.D. based on having received a degree from Concordia. She holds a valid [[master's degree]] and devoted five years of study to a Ph.D. program which she did not complete. She is therefore legally qualified to use the term "psychotherapist" but not "psychologist" according to state licensing requirements.

In 2010, IT services firm EDS lost a court case brought by broadcaster [[British Sky Broadcasting|BSkyB]] after the British High Court ruled that the company had misled BSkyB about its expertise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnews.com.au/News/165653,eds-loses-vital-court-case-against-bskyb.aspx "EDS loses vital court case against BSkyB"] Jan 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Part of EDS' case hinged on the testimony of Joe Galloway, a former Managing Director for CRM Solutions, who provided implementation timeframes to BSkyB that later turned out to be unrealistic. Galloway's credibility as a witness was severely undermined by his defence of a mail-order degree from Concordia. Although he "gave detailed evidence on how he took plane journeys between the islands and attended a college there", a member of the opposing legal team managed to obtain the same degree for his dog "Lulu". The blow to the witness' credibility was reported as pivotal to the success of the case.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.itnews.com.au/News/165888,key-eds-witness-bought-internet-degree.aspx Key EDS witness bought internet degree]," iTnews, Jan 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Smith County, Texas]] ===
In 2013, a whistle-blower at the Smith County Sheriffs department alleged that she was retaliated against after not complying with a deputy attempting to gain a pay increase based on a diploma from Concordia College and University in Wilmington, Delaware; the whistle-blower objected to the degree submission because she considered the institution a "diploma mill".&lt;ref&gt;Staff, KLTV Digital Media.

The '''Department of Computer Science''' is a department of the [[Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics]] at the [[Comenius University]] in [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]]. It is headed by Prof. RNDr. [[Branislav Rovan]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Phd]].

== Educational and scientific achievements ==

The first comprehensive computer science curriculum in [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Slovakia]]) was introduced at the Faculty in 1973. The department, established in 1974, continues to be responsible for organizing the major part of the undergraduate and graduate computer science education to this date. The distinguishing feature of the curriculum has been a balanced coverage of the mathematical foundations, theoretical computer science, and practical computer science. The part of the curriculum covered by the department at present includes courses on computer architecture, system software, networks, databases, software design, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages, computational complexity, discrete mathematics, cryptology, data security and others.

The department succeeded several times in project applications within the TEMPUS Programme of the [[European Union|EU]]. The projects CIPRO and „Neumann Network“ helped to build the departmental hardware infrastructure and to establish the expertise in Unix workstation technology, networking, and structured document processing. The CUSTU PARLAB parallel computing laboratory run jointly with the Department of Informatics of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the [[Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava|Slovak Technical University]] also resulted from one of these projects. Furthermore, the department participated in project LEARN-ED under the COPERNICUS Programme and built a multimedia laboratory.

The department has been involved in the organization of one of the top European conferences in theoretical computer science ? MFCS ? each time it took place in Slovakia. Further conferences recently organized or co-organized by the department include SOFSEM '98 and DISC '99. Besides, the department houses the secretariat of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, of the Slovak Society for Computer Science and of the Association for Security of Information Technologies (ASIT).

== Research topics ==

Research in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics has the longest tradition in the department. Most notably, the result of [[Róbert Szelepcsényi]] on the closure of nondeterministic space under complement, independently obtained also by N. Immerman, brought the [[Gödel Prize]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and [[EATCS]] to both of them in 1995. More recently research in parallel and distributed computing, cryptology and information security, and in software development has been initiated. The department is involved in international cooperation on the development of the structured document editor within the Euromath Project. 
The department has many international contacts, succeeded in research project application (project ALTEC ? „Algorithms for Future Technologies“) with partners from EU, and also has two research grants from the Slovak Grant Agency.

== Technical equipment ==

A network consisting of 20 workstations ([[Sun Microsystems|Sun]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] in two workstation labs), Parsytec (with 20 [[transputer]]s and OS Parix), and standard PCs connected to a network.

'''Dover Business College''' was a [[vocational school]] and [[technical college]] with locations in [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]] and [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]], [[New Jersey]]. Dover Business College, which was founded in 1958 and accredited in 1974, was a private institution with a focus on preparing students for careers in healthcare, information technology, and business. The college awarded more than 2,800 diplomas in its last five years.&lt;ref&gt;http://us.vocuspr.com/Newsroom/Query.aspx?SiteName=Berkeley&amp;Entity=PRAsset&amp;SF_PRAsset_PRAssetID_EQ=135292&amp;XSL=PressRelease&amp;Cache={{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was merged into Berkeley College on July 1, 2013. Many of the programs that were offered at Dover Business College are now available at Berkeley College via the college's School of Health Studies, which was established to coincide with the merger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/news/218945101_Business_schools_in_Clifton_merge.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkeley College has six New Jersey locations following the Dover acquisition. Locations are in Clifton, Dover, Newark, Paramus, Woodbridge, and Woodland Park. The college also has three New York locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and White Plains. The school also offers programs through Berkeley College Online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/njs_other_college_merger_berkeley_takes_over_dover_business_college.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:E@I seminario Brno 2006 partoprenintoj.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Participants of an E@I seminar in November 2006]]

'''E@I''' (“Education@Internet”) is an international [[youth]] [[non-profit organization]] that promotes [[international]] collaboration and communication and hosts [[education]]al projects and meetings to support [[cross-cultural communication|intercultural]] learning and the usage of [[language]]s and [[internet]] technologies.

E@I started as an informal international work group in 1999, before it was officially registered in [[Slovakia]] in 2005. E@I's activities include the development of educational [[website]]s ([[lernu!]] and [[Slovake.eu]] among others), publishing, such as producing [[book]]s and [[DVD]]s, and organizing [[Academic conference|conferences]] and [[seminar]]s, for example, the biennial [[Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology|KAEST]] or the [[Esperanto Wikimania]] in 2011. A specialist group within the organization is dedicated to Wikipedia.

E@I is a member organization of the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[European Youth Foundation]] and one of the 29 organizations represented in the [[European Commission]]'s [[Civil Society Platform for Multlingualism]]. Projects run by the organization have been subsidized by the [[Esperantic Studies Foundation]] and the European Commission's [[Youth in Action|Youth in Action programme]] and [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013|Lifelong Learning Programme]] (through [[Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency|EACEA]]). The coordinator of E@I's activities is Peter Baláž, who has been elected ''Esperantist of the Year 2012'' in a poll held by the renowned magazine ''[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Goals ==

E@I envisions a peaceful, harmonious world where everyone in the world can [[communication|communicate]] with each other easily and quickly. E@I aims to achieve this goal through three main actions:

* Encourage intercultural education, collaboration and communication
* Support [[education]] of [[internet]] [[technology]] and [[language]]s
* Help ensure the application of the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]

E@I supports projects focused on international collaboration, and organizes cultural [[seminar]]s on the importance and utility of free international communication.

Organizing seminars is one of the main activities of E@I. These seminars focus on furthering collaboration through the use of the internet and training novices or those who are not very familiar with new technology. New project ideas are often born out of these meetings.

== Name ==
The letter "E" in E@I represents Edukado ([[Education]]). However, it can also signify: Efikeco ([[Effectiveness]]), [[Esperanto]], Evoluo ([[Evolution]]), Eŭropo ([[Europe]]). The letter "I" in E@I represents Interreto ([[Internet]]). It can also represent: Interkulturo (Interculturalness), Informo ([[Information]]), Ideo ([[Idea]]), Inspiro ([[Artistic inspiration|Inspiration]]). The "[[@]]" sign indicates the synergy needed between the two main ideas in order to achieve E@I's goal of international communication. E@I is often expanded as "Edukado@Interreto" (Education@Internet) or "Esperanto@Interreto" (Esperanto@Internet). However, the two letters have many possible significations. As a result, the organization was named E@I in its official registration.

== History ==

The Idea of E@I began in November 1999. A conference of the same name was soon held in April 2000 in Tollare, Sweden. As a result of this meeting, an international group with the same name was started. During the 56th IJK ([[International Youth Congress of Esperanto]]) in [[Hong Kong]], Henning von Rosen and Hokan Lundberg presented the ideas and goals of E@I. In 2001, E@I registered their website, ikso.net. At the same time, the charitable foundation "E@I" was created in the cadre of UEA/TEJO. The second Esperanto@Interreto conference took place in October 2001 in [[Uppsala]]. The third conference followed in 2002. This conference was a collaboration with non-Esperantists, and was bilingual [[Esperanto]]/English. In between 2002 and 2004, many of E@I's projects were in development, especially [[lernu!]], [[Lingva Prismo]] and [[Interkulturo]]. The first board of directors was also created, consisting of 5 members.

On 14 November 2005, E@I was registered as a civil association in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in [[Slovakia]]. E@I decided to officially register itself as "E@I" instead of the expanded "Esperanto@Interreto". On 1 August 2007, a new board of directors was inaugurated with the head position held by Peter Baláž. In 2007, E@I was accepted as a member of the EYF ([[European Youth Foundation]]).

E@I continues to work on its various internet projects and conferences today. The most recently completed project being, [[Slovake.eu]], the first website dedicated to learning the [[Slovak language]] for which E@I has received a subsidy of 256,000 euros from the [[European Commission]]'s [[EACEA]]. E@I has also started allowing university students to do [[internship]]s through the [[Erasmus Programme]].

In February 2012, Peter Baláž, Indre Pileckytė, Jevgenij Gaus and Neringa Gaus toured China as a result of the increasing number of Chinese lernu! users, and to possibly start a conference similar to SES in China.

== Internal structure ==

E@I is regulated by a [[statute]] under which a 3 to 9 member [[board of directors]] runs the organization. The other sections of E@I are its elected commission, its financial commission, and its members.

=== Members ===

Members of E@I are those who have agreed to the terms of the statute of E@I and have sent the necessary information to E@I. Those in between the ages of 15 and 35 are considered regular members. Some people are considered special members without having voting rights. E@I membership is free of charge. According to the E@I website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikso.net/eo/pri_ecxei/membroj.php "Members" in the official website of E@I]&lt;/ref&gt; there are now around 20 thousand members.

=== Board of directors ===

The current board of directors was inaugurated on August 1, 2007, and currently consists of the following people:

* Peter Baláž - Coordinating and project planning
* Marek Blahuš - General secretary
* Jevgenij Gaus - Administration of web projects
* Yves Nevelsteen - treasurer

The original board of directors was elected in April 2003, and consisted of Chuck Smith, Hokan Lundberg, Nastja Koĵevnikova, Ralf Frölich and Sonja Petrović.&lt;ref name="ecxei-5"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031027022434/http://www.ikso.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RaportoBostono EcheI: RaportoBostono]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employees and interns ===

Katarína Nosková is the first paid employee of E@I. Her main projects have been the Slovake.eu project, handling donations, administrative tasks, and correspondence.

Starting 2010, E@I has accepted [[intern]]s in the form of [[university]] [[student]]s who usually work for a few months on various E@I projects. The internship can count as a part of their studies.

=== Office ===

On the 1 June 2011, the town of [[Partizánske]] and its major, Jozef Božik, decided to give E@I its own office in downtown Partizánske, for the symbolic cost of 1 euro per year.

== Activity ==
[[File:Somera Esperanto-Studado emblemo.jpg|200px|right]]
[[File:KAEST emblemo.jpg|200px|right|link=Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology]]

The organization of educational conferences is an essential part of E@I. E@I was itself formed during a [[TEJO]] conference entitled "Esperanto@Interreto".

=== Seminars ===

In the first few years of its existence, trainings on education and the internet were an integral part of the development of E@I, aiding it in finding many new members. For its first few years, E@I was a scholarly branch of TEJO. As a result, E@I's first few seminars were a collaboration with [[TEJO]].

Starting in 2007, E@I has arranged a conference every summer entitled SES. In 2007, the title was "Slava Esperanto-Studado" (Slavic Esperanto-Study), but since then the conference has been renamed to "Somera Esperanto-Studado".

=== KAEST ===

KAEST stands for "Konferenco pri Aplikoj de Esperanto en Scienco kaj Tekniko" ([[Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology]]) and is a biannual conference held by E@I. The event has a history going back to [[Czechoslovakia]] of 1978, and the first KAEST held by E@I took place in November 2010 in [[Modra]]. The conference is organized by E@I with financial support from organizations such as [[International Esperanto Institute]] and [[Esperantic Studies Foundation]].

E@I has created many [[website]]s and [[publication]]s related to [[education]] on the [[internet]] that are related to [[Esperanto]] or [[language]]s in general.

=== lernu! ===

''[[lernu!]]'' is a multilingual course for students of [[Esperanto]]. In addition to courses at different levels, the site contains additional learning tools such as [[dictionary|dictionaries]], a [[grammar|grammatical]] overview, spoken stories with pictures, an [[instant messenger]] and more.&lt;ref name="E@I projects"&gt;[http://www.ikso.net/en/projektoj/index.php E@I Projects ''(official website)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slovake.eu ===

[[Slovake.eu]] is a multilingual website to teach the [[Slovak language]] to foreigners. The project is supported by the [[European Commission]]'s agency [[EACEA]] within its Lifelong learning programme and was launched in March 2011. The website is being constructed on the basis of experience gained in lernu.net and other internet projects. Six partners from five countries have participated in the project.&lt;ref name="E@I projects"/&gt;

=== Komputeko ===

[[Komputeko]] is a portal of computer related terms in as many languages as possible, created in order to promote correct language usage and face the use of (often crippled forms of) [[US English]] terms.&lt;ref name="E@I projects"/&gt;

=== Polish DVD ===
On 10 September 2008, a [[DVD]] titled ''Esperanto'' produced by E@I was included as a free-of-charge attachment to the leading Polish newspaper [[Gazeta Wyborcza]], commissioned by the city of [[Białystok]] as part of the official campaign preceding the 150th birth anniversary of [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the creator of [[Esperanto]] born in 1859 in Białystok, and promoting the 94th [[World Congress of Esperanto]] which was to be held in Białystok from 25 July to 1 August 2009. The DVD was issued in 364,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberafolio.org/2008/gazetawyborcza/ Libera Folio: "Tricent mil poloj eksciis pri Esperanto"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reta PIV ===

An internet version of the [[Plena Ilustrita Vortaro de Esperanto|Plena Ilustrita Vortaro]], the largest monolingual [[dictionary]] of [[Esperanto]]. This project has been realized with the cooperation of [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda|SAT]], the publisher of PIV and holder of its author rights, and with the help of donations [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] from [[Esperanto association]]s, [[Esperanto club]]s and individual [[Esperantist]]s.

=== Deutsch.info ===

[[Deutsch.info]] is a multilingual website for teaching [[German language|German]] to non-German speakers. Similarly to Slovake.eu, the project is supported by [[European Commission]]'s agency [[EACEA]] within its Lifelong learning programme, and was launched in 2013.

In 2005, the [[literacy]] rate in Laos was estimated to be 73% (83% male and 63% female).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education before the Lao People's Democratic Republic==
Of the many ethnic groups in Laos, only the [[Lao Loum]] had a tradition of formal education, reflecting the fact that the languages of the other groups had no written script. Until the mid-20th century, education was primarily based in the Buddhist temple school (wat school), where the monks taught novices and other boys to read both [[Lao language|Lao]] and [[Pali]] scripts, basic arithmetic, and other religious and social subjects. Many villages had wat schools for novices and other village boys. However, only ordained boys and men in urban monasteries had access to advanced study.&lt;ref name=ep&gt;Ireson, W. Randall. "Education Prior to the Lao People's Democratic Republic".[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/latoc.html ''A country study: Laos''] (Andrea Matles Savada, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (July 1994). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Teacher in Laos.jpg|thumb|Teacher in a primary school in northern Laos]]

During the colonial period, the [[France|French]] established a secular education system patterned after schools in France, and French was the language of instruction after the second or third grade. This system was largely irrelevant to the needs and lifestyles of the vast majority of the rural population, despite its extension to some district centers and a few villages. However, it did produce a small elite drawn primarily from the royal family and noble households. Many children of [[Vietnam]]ese immigrants to Laos—who made up the majority of the colonial civil service—attended these schools and, in fact, constituted a significant proportion of the students at secondary levels in urban centers.

Post-secondary education was not available in Laos, and the few advanced students traveled to [[Hanoi]], [[Danang]], and [[Hué]] in Vietnam and to [[Phnom Penh]] in [[Cambodia]] for specialized training; fewer still continued with university-level studies in France.&lt;ref name=ep/&gt;

The Pathet Lao began to provide Lao language instruction in the schools under its control in the late 1950s, and a Laotian curriculum began to be developed in the late 1960s in the RLG schools. In 1970 about one-third of the civilian employees of the RLG were teachers, although the majority of these were poorly paid and minimally trained elementary teachers. At that time, there were about 200,000 elementary students enrolled in RLG schools, around 36 percent of the school-age population.&lt;ref name=ep/&gt;

==Education since 1975==
An important goal of the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] (LPDR) government was to establish a system of universal [[primary education]] by 1985. The LPDR took over the existing [[Royal Lao Government]] education system that had been established in 1950s and restructured it, facing many of the same problems that had confronted previous governments. The French system of education was replaced with a Laotian curriculum, although lack of teaching materials has impeded effective instruction.&lt;ref name=es&gt;Ireson, W. Randall. "Education since 1975".[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/latoc.html ''A country study: Laos''] (Andrea Matles Savada, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (July 1994). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An intensive adult literacy campaign was initiated in 1983-84, which mobilized educated persons living in [[village]]s and [[urban area|urban]] neighborhoods to bring basic reading and writing skills to over 750,000 adults. Largely as a result of this campaign, those able to read and write had increased to an estimated 44 percent. According to the [[United Nations]], by 1985 those able to read and write were estimated at 92 percent of men and 76 percent of women ages 15 to 45. Because few reading materials are available, especially in the rural areas, many newly literate adults lose much of their proficiency after a few years.&lt;ref name=es&gt;Ireson, W. Randall. "Education since 1975".[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/latoc.html ''A country study: Laos''] (Andrea Matles Savada, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (July 1994). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Primary Laos3.jpg|thumb|Students in a small village school in southern Laos]]
The decision to establish universal education led the government to focus its efforts on building and staffing [[school]]s in nearly every village. Because resources are limited, most schools are poorly constructed—of bamboo and thatch—and staffed by one or two teachers who are paid low wages, usually in arrears. Many village schools have only one or two grades; books, paper, or other teaching materials are conspicuous by their scarcity.&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

School enrollment has increased since 1975. In 1988 primary school enrollment was estimated at 63 percent of all school-age children. In 1992-93 an estimated 603,000 students were in primary school, compared to 317,000 students in 1976 and 100,000 students in 1959. However, the goal of achieving universal primary education was postponed from 1985 to 2000 as a result of the lack of resources.&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

Because [[teacher]]s are paid irregularly, they are forced to spend significant amounts of time [[agriculture|farming]] or in other livelihood activities, with the result that in many locations classes are  held for only a few hours a day. Because of irregular classes, overcrowding, and lack of learning resources, the average student needed 11 to 12 years to complete the five-year primary course in the late 1980s. Repetition rates ranged from 40 percent for the first grade to 14 percent for the fifth grade. [[Dropping out|Dropouts]] were a significant problem, with 22 percent of all entering first graders leaving school before the second grade. In the late 1980s, only 45 percent of entering first graders completed all five years of primary school, up from 18 percent in 1969.&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

Performance statistics vary according to rural-urban location, ethnic group, and gender. Enrollment and school quality are higher in urban areas, where the usefulness of a formal education is more evident than in rural farming communities. Isolated teachers confronted with primitive rural living and teaching conditions have a difficult time maintaining their own commitment as well as the interest of their pupils. Ethnic minority students who have no tradition of literacy and who do not speak Lao have a particularly difficult time. Unless the teacher is of the same or similar ethnic group as the students, communication and culturally appropriate education are limited. Because of these factors, in the late 1980s the enrollment rate for the [[Lao Sung]] was less than half that of the [[Lao Loum]]; enrollment was also low for [[Lao Theung]] children.&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

[[File:Blackboard Laos.jpg|thumb|Students writing on the blackboard in a village school]]
Girls are less likely than boys to attend school and attend for fewer years—a discrepancy that was declining, however, in the early 1990s. In 1969 only 37 percent of students in primary school were girls; by 1989, however, 44 percent of primary school students were girls. Because of Lao Sung cultural attitudes toward girls' and women's responsibilities, girls in these groups accounted for only 26 percent of all students.&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

[[Secondary education]] enrollment has expanded since 1975 but as of mid-1994 was still limited in availability and scope. In 1992-93 only about 130,000 students were enrolled in all postprimary programs, including lower- and upper-secondary schools, vocational programs, and teacher-training schools. The exodus of Laotian elite after 1975 deprived vocational and secondary schools of many of their staff, a situation that was only partly offset by students returning from training in socialist countries. Between 1975 and 1990, the government granted over 14,000 scholarships for study in at least eight socialist countries: just over 7,000 were to the [[Soviet Union]], followed by 2,500 to [[Vietnam]], and 1,800 to the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany).&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

In mid-1994 the school year was nine months. The ideal sequence included five years of primary school, followed by three years of lower-secondary school and three years of upper-secondary school. In 2010, another year was added to upper-secondary school, for a total of 12 years of primary and secondary education. Some students go directly from primary or lower-secondary school to vocational instruction, for example, in teacher-training schools or agriculture schools.&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

Local secondary education is concentrated in the provincial capitals and some district centers. Dropout rates for students at secondary and technical schools are not as high as among primary students, but the gender and ethnic group differentials are more pronounced. In the late 1980s, only 7% of lower-secondary students were Lao Sung or Lao Theung, a rate that dropped to 3% in upper-secondary school. For most students who do not live in a provincial center, attendance at secondary school requires boarding away from home in makeshift facilities. This situation further discourages students in rural areas from pursuing further education, with additional differential impacts on girls and minorities. [[Vientiane]] has the majority of advanced schools, including the national [[Normal school|teachers' training school]] at Dong Dok, the irrigation college at [[Tad Thong]], the agriculture college at [[Na Phok]], the National Polytechnic Institute, and the University of Medical Sciences. Even so, the level of training available at these schools is low.&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

In 1986 the government began to reform the education system, with the goals of linking educational development more closely to the socioeconomic situation in each locality, improving science training and emphasis, expanding networks to remote mountainous regions, and recruiting minority teachers. The plan envisioned making education more relevant to daily realities and building increased cooperation in educational activities among the ministries, mass organizations, and the community. However, the ability to implement this program through its scheduled completion in 2000 depended on a significant budgetary increase to the education sector in addition to receiving significant foreign aid. Education accounted for only 8 percent of government expenditures in 1988, down from a 10% to 15% range during the preceding seven-year period, and cultural expenditures were not accorded a high priority.&lt;ref name=es/&gt;

Although more school texts and general magazines are being printed, poor distribution systems and budgetary constraints limit their availability throughout the country. Overall, 3.9 million books were printed in 1989, including school texts published by the Ministry of Education, and novels, stories, and poems published by the Ministry of Information and Culture. Translations into Lao of Russian-language technical, literary, and children's books were available through the Novosti press agency. Virtually all these materials are inexpensive paperbound editions. 

Distribution of school texts is improving, and magazines and novels can occasionally be found in district markets distant from [[Vientiane]]. Thai printed material—for the most part, magazines and books—was available after the late 1980s in a few shops. Yet, in the early 1990s, it was rare to see a book or any other reading material in rural villages, with the exception of political posters or a months-old edition of the newspaper ''Xieng Pasason'' ("Voice of the People") pasted on a house wall.

==Development challenge in Laos’s education system==
[[Image:Primary Laos.jpg|Pupils in a small village school in a rural area in northern Laos, December 2007|thumb]]
[[File:ThakhekKindergarten.jpg|thumb|Kindergarten in [[Thakhek]].]]

[[File:LuangPrabangUni.jpg|thumb|University Campus in [[Luang Prabang]].]]
The Lao population of 6.5 million is ethnically and linguistically diverse. The government has defined 49 ethnic groups, many having their own language.&lt;ref&gt;Lao Front for National Construction. "The Ethnic Groups in Lao PDR", Vientiane, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; School attendance, literacy, and other indicators of educational attainment vary greatly among different ethnic groups. Census data from 1995 reveal that 23 percent of the Lao never went to school as compared with 34, 56, and 67 percent for Phutai, Khmu, and Hmong. Among two of the smallest ethnic groups, 94 percent of the Kor and 96 percent of the Musir never attended school. The quality of instruction tends to be poor, and nearly half of those who enter do not complete the primary cycle.

Lao, the official and instructional language, is the first language of about 50 percent of the population. Children from homes where Lao is not spoken enter schools with a significant handicap, a condition partly accounting for the high dropout rate. Changing the language of instruction would be a complex problem; however, steps can be taken by schools to assist non-Lao speaking pupils.

The rural quality of Laos implicates the provision of education as urbanization facilitates educational delivery. It is more expensive to provide schools for each small village than to build a smaller number of large schools in cities. These rural-urban differences are even more significant for provision of secondary, technical or vocational schools given the higher unit costs involved.  The quantity and quality of schooling are influenced by demographic structures and are highly sensitive to the size of the school-age cohort. 

The extremely young population of Lao PDR puts a heavy burden on schooling and, at the same time, the high [[dependency ratio]] contributes to the low national productivity. Large families force choices as to which children go to school, tending to suppress female enrollments and indirectly reducing the number of subsequent opportunities for girls in education and in the labor market.

The education system is evolving under severely constraining conditions of inadequately prepared and poorly paid teachers, insufficient funding, shortages of facilities, and often ineffective allocation of the limited resources available. There is significant geographic, ethnic, gender and wealth disparities in the distribution of educational services, and inequalities exist in every level of the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2606">'''Education in the Joseon Dynasty''' of [[Korea]] was largely aimed at preparing students for government service.  The ultimate goal of most students was successful passage of the state examinations, known as ''[[gwageo]]''.  

Educational institutions were extremely widespread in the country, and can be divided into public and private.  The highest public institution was the [[Seonggyungwan]], located in [[Seoul]].  Below this were the ''Sahak'' (사부학당), four schools providing technical training, and the ''[[hyanggyo]]'', schools supported by each of the [[Eight Provinces of Korea|Eight Provinces]]. {{ref|nahm-1}}  The ''hyanggyo'' soon fell into neglect, and for most of the Joseon period education was dominated by two types of private schools, ''[[seowon]]'' (preparatory schools mostly for the aristocracy) and ''[[seodang]]'' (private village schools providing elementary education).

==Civil service examinations==

{{main|Gwageo}}

The civil service examinations, known as ''gwageo'', assessed subject's ability to interpret the [[Chinese classic texts|Chinese classics]], in terms of official [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] ideology.  Only those who came from high-ranking families were permitted to take the test.  The gwageo were divided into civil and military sections, with the military section being open to people of relatively lower rank.  The gwageo system had been set up in the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, but reached its peak in the Joseon period.

==State-supported education==

===Seonggyungwan===

{{main|Seonggyungwan}}

The Seonggyungwan was the highest educational institution in Joseon, and attracted scholars from across the country.  It was based on the Goryeo-period [[Gukjagam]].

==Confucian curriculum==

The Korean Confucian [[curriculum]] was based on the Chinese educational system which had 15 or so primary works, and a large number of exegetical works, along with graded exams that were on set topics. All of these works were written in [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]], the academic written language of Joseon.  A common introductory textbook was the [[Lesser Learning]], an exegetical work by [[Zhu Xi]].

==Reception==
Professor [[Paul Thagard]], writing in ''[[Science for the People]]'', describes the book as, "intelligible and entertaining,"&lt;ref name="SP01" /&gt; while Henry McDonald, writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', describes it as "well illustrated and thoroughly researched".&lt;ref name="WP01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Modern Thought Made Easy |first=Henry |last=McDonald |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1979/10/07/modern-thought-made-easy/cc43140d-dc10-47cf-aaa0-a4423783c24d/ |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=1979-10-07 |accessdate=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Almost half the book," according to Nan Conklin, writing in ''[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]]'', "is devoted to recounting Einstein’s early life and the influences on him."&lt;ref name="L01" /&gt; "Its discussion of the political environment in which Einstein's discoveries were made is." according to McDonald, "informative."&lt;ref name="WP01" /&gt;

"The drawing and the words have a distinctly comic-book flavor," according to Conklin, but it is,  "only when the authors set out to explain Einstein’s theories that the use of the peculiar mode of presentation seems justified."&lt;ref name="L01" /&gt; McDonald describes, "the presentation of the discoveries themselves is little short of inspired,"&lt;ref name="WP01" /&gt; while Thagard too commends the authors as, "highly inventive in using amusing illustrations and humorous asides to lead the beginners through difficult concepts."&lt;ref name="SP01" /&gt;

While Conklin speculates that the publishers may have included a volume on Einstein in this series due to his belief in, "the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals,"&lt;ref name="L01" /&gt;  and McDonald confirms that the authors, "go out of their way to emphasize [...] Einstein's socialism," Thagard is critical of the failure to, "develop the social connections in a substantial way," and concludes that the volume does not provide a, "basis for discussion of the role of science in society."&lt;ref name="SP01" /&gt;

'''Gangadhar Pradhan''' (10 July 1948 – 10 October 2010) was an eminent [[Odissi dance|Odissi]] (Orissi) exponent and teacher, who founded the Konark Natya Mandap in Konark [[Puri]] in 1986 and organised dance festivals in the temple city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newkerala.com/news/world/fullnews-60414.html|title=World News Headlines|publisher=Newkerela.com|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born on 10 July 1948 in Parikula in [[Puri]] in the Indian state of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], he died in [[Bhubaneswar]] on 11 October 2010. He had several leading dancer-disciples, besides earning top national and international honours.

==Early life==
Pradhan was born on 10 July 1948 to Muralidahr Pradhan and Dwitika Devi, of Parikul. Initially, he neither cried nor moved, giving the impression that he was stillborn. The father vowed that if the child survived, he would send him to serve their deity Lord Balunkeshwar for 5 years. At age 3, while travelling in a bullock cart, the boy fell and was injured severely. The father vowed to send him for 10 years instead of 5. From age 5 to 15, the boy worked in a temple as a devotee of Lord [[Shiva]].

While there he did chores, help and obey the seniors, look after the harvest, study and take lessons of dance as a [[Gotipua]] dancer. In this dance form, boys dress like girls to perform. The boy was fair in colour. He had handsome features and grew his hair long. He was a quick learner. Though only senior boys were allowed to learn Mardal, a musical instrument, he furtively taught himself to play the instrument while the older boys worked at the paddy fields.

In July 1966, he arrived in [[Bhubaneswar]] and entered Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya. His talent as a Mardal player made his teachers depend on him as an accompanist. Parents of female students started inviting him for accompanying their daughters for practice. Gradually he started teaching students privately. In his third year, he played Mardal for noted dancer Rita Devi and went to Mumbai. There, he started participating in many programmes. He won 1st prize in all Orissa Dance Competition held at Puri. Then came opportunities in Oriya films, opera and theatres where he directed dance sequences in their plays and productions. He completed his Nrityacharya degree course in 1971.

== Career ==
He received a National Scholarship from 1971 to 1973 under Padmabibhusan Guru [[Kelucharan Mohapatra]]. He got extensive theory from [[\|Dhirendranath Pattnaik]]. Pradhan married Smt. Sulochana Pradhan in 1972. By the time he had finished college, he had established himself among the art lovers of Bhubaneswar. After the scholarship he took two years additional training in Odissi dance and trained himself in mastering the Mardal. He was actively associated with many organisations such as Bhubaneswar Kalakendra, Sangeeta of Jatni, Chilika Sangeet Parishad and Balugaon. He directed and choreographed many dance items for the annual day events of schools and colleges. He got involved in Ekamra theatres from 1969. He found a patron in Kamala Lochana Mohanty of Ekamra theatres. From 1979–96 he travelled with Padmashree Late Sanjukta Panigrahi.

=== Orissa Dance Academy ===
In 1973, he started an organisation called Natyaloka, drawing help and inspiration from Pt. [[Raghunath Panigrahi]] and Late Smt [[Sanjukta Panigrahi]]. He renamed it Sunati and in 1975 renamed it again, to Orissa Dance Academy. The initial 35 students included Krushnapriya Pattjoshi, Saratpriya Pattjoshi, Susmita Mitra, Dipti Sahoo, Digbala Sahoo, Aruna Mohanty, Archana Mohanty, Annapurna Panda, Jaba Dey and Ananya Das. Classes were held three times a week.

With the help of journalist B.K. Kanungo, he held classes at Sambadika Bhawan, which belonged to the Journalist Association. Another early supporter was Dhiren Pattnaik, Secretary of Orissa Sangeet Natak Akademi. Orissa Dance Academy was formally registered with Pattnaik as President, Bhabani Biswal as Secretary and Guruji as Principal. In 1978, the golden era of Orissa Dance Academy began with Guru Gangadhar Pradhan and Aruna Mohanty participating in the India festivals held in Germany and Belgium.

In 1980, students of Orissa Dance Academy, Dipti Sahoo, Saratpriya Pattajoshi, Pagala Swain, Nandita Patnaik and Aruna Mohanty joined a cultural delegation by ICCR managed by Pattnaik that travelled to Portugal, Spain, Holland and Italy. By this time, students such as Minakshi Behera, Chapala Mishra and Mamata Nayak had started performing. The Academy relocated and became one of the premier cultural institutions of India. It has about 300 students and a 30 dancer performance unit.

The school acts as an umbrella organisation for some 33 other cultural organisations both in India and abroad, including Chitralekha Dance Academy Toronto, Centre for World Music San Diego, an institution in Amsterdam, Holland, Sangeeta Nritya Academy-Assam and Purva-Baroda.

Apart from choreography, composing dance dramas and ballets, he composed in the genre of regional folk dance. The Academy has performed for national and international audiences. 

=== Konark Natya Mandap ===
[[File:Konark Natya Mandap, Konark, Puri district, Odisha, India.jpg|thumb|Konark Natya Mandap in a non performing day.]]
Pradhan established Konark Natya Mandap in 1986. It hosts classes on Gotipua, Odissi dance, Mardal, Tabla and Odissi vocals.

On its three stages students and others present art forms such as Sankirtan, Paika akhada, Pala, Daskathia, Ramalila on occasions such as Basant Panchami and Jhulan Purnima.

=== Kala Mandir ===
To promote Orissan art and culture, he established Chandrasekhar Kala Mandir in 1992, at Parikul, Puri. Training is imparted in both Odissi and Gotipua facilities 

=== Festivals ===
The Konark Dance and Music Festival was first held in 1986, at Arkavihar, Konark, becoming an International fete, presenting dancers, musicians, artists and scholars from across the globe. It is held every year from 19th – 23 February. 

\The Kalinga Kala [[Utsav]] began from the inception of the Chandrasekhar KalaMandir, Parikul, Puri about 11 years ago. It is held every year in April. Pradhan acquired a plot of land, near Dhauligiri, Bhubaneswar. 

The 1st Dhauli Mahotsavas was held from 27 to 29 March. For this effort towards promotion of culture, Pradhan was awarded the State Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. The nation awarded him the Central Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, by the President of India.

The '''National Science and Maths Quiz''' is an annual [[science]] and [[mathematics]] based national level quiz competition for senior high schools in Ghana. It has been produced by Primetime Limited, an advertising and public relations agency with an interest in education, since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-44903591/the-national-science-and-maths-quiz-has-kept-ghanaians-thrilled-for-25-years|title=Inside Ghana's wild and raucous quiz show|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the '''National Science &amp; Maths Quiz''' has been to promote the study of the sciences and mathematics, help students develop quick thinking and a probing and scientific mind about the things around them, while fostering healthy academic rivalry among senior high schools. 

The quiz, popularly referred to as “brilla” by many who have gone through the secondary school system is by far one of the few academic events that bring all of Ghana’s secondary schools together. The schools and students look forward to it. The National Science and Maths Quiz is the longest running educational programme on a Ghanaian television. It is broadcast on [[GTV (Ghana)|GTV]] every Saturday at 11am and Wednesdays at 4pm.

== History ==
The idea for the production of a quiz programme aimed at encouraging the study of the sciences and mathematics was not mooted at a national science fair or conference. It happened on the tennis court of the University of Ghana, Legonm in 1993. Mr. Kwaku Mensa-Bonsu, then Managing Director of Primetime, was at the court to play the game after his own heart with his playmates, the late Professors Marian Ewurama Addy and Ebenezer Kweku Awotwe. Mr. Mensa-Bonsu was curious as to why birds could stand on a live electric wire without getting electrocuted, but human beings could not do same. From Prof. Awotwe’s explanation, Mr. Mensa-Bonsu got the idea of putting together a quiz programme on science and maths. Since then, the National Science &amp; Maths Quiz has seen 23 editions.

When the quiz started, it involved only 32 schools across the country, and these were divided into the Northern Sector and Southern Sector, with 16 schools per sector. Winners in both sectors were then brought to Accra for the national championship. Prempeh College won the maiden edition. 

In 1997, the geographical sector system was abandoned, and two northern sector schools (from the old format), [[Opoku Ware Senior High School|Opoku Ware School]] and [[Prempeh College]] made it to the finals where [[Opoku Ware Senior High School|Opoku Ware School]] won their first trophy. 

In 1998, the tournament became known as the National Science &amp; Maths Quiz, when it lost its sponsorship from Brillant. From 2000, the number of schools was increased to 40 and in 2013, the number of participating schools went up to 81, although 66 turned up for the competition. Thus, the participation format was changed to three schools competing per contest, instead of two, as had been the case since the programme’s inception. To give the programme a national character, the quiz has since 2014 involved 135 schools from all parts of Ghana.

The first quiz mistress was the late Professor [[Marian Ewurama Addy]], professor of biochemistry at the University of Ghana, Legon. She was quiz-mistress from 1993-2000. “When in 1993/94, during the planning of a televised quiz programme on Science, I was asked to be the Quiz Mistress, I could not say No”, she wrote in her memoirs, Rewards: An Autobiography. “I was interested in females becoming scientists and this was an opportunity to invite the young ones to become scientists…I thought that this was a most effective way of being a role model,” she added. No doubt she steered the quiz in such a fine manner. 

As a recognition of her contribution to promoting the study of Science and Mathematics amongst girls through the NSMQ, Prof. Addy was named the Marketing Woman of the year by the Chartered Institute of Marketing in 1995.

Dr. Eureka Emefa Adomako, a botanist at the [[University of Ghana|University of Ghana, Legon]], took over as quiz-mistress from 2001 to 2005, having been recommended by Prof. Addy. Dr. Adomako took charge of the programme until she had to leave for postgraduate studies. Before leaving, just as Prof. Addy recommended her as quiz mistress, Dr. Adomako recommended that Dr. Kaufmann take over as quiz mistress.

In 2006, Dr. [[Elsie Effah Kaufmann]], the Head of the Biomedical Engineering Department at the University of Ghana, Legon, took over as quiz mistress. Over the past ten years, she has succeeded in bringing her own style to the programme, occasionally injecting some humor into an otherwise formal programme. As the chairperson of the moderation team, Dr. Kaufmann is supported by a team of consultants made up of Prof. W.A. Asomaning, Dr. Ebenezer Owusu, Dr. Amos Kuditcher and Dr. Douglas Adu-Gyamfi, all of the University of Ghana, Legon.

[[Presbyterian Boys' Senior High School|Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School]], Legon is the most successful school in the quiz so far, with five titles. They have also been to the finals seven times, equaled only by [[Opoku Ware Senior High School|Opoku Ware School]] and [[St. Peter's Boys Senior High School|St. Peter’s Boys Senior Secondary School]]. Achimota School is the only unisex school to have won the competition so far. No female-only school has ever won the competition. Only 11 schools out of the hundreds of senior high schools in Ghana have won the competition since its inception.

From 2012, the GES, through the Conference of Heads of Assisted Schools took up the sponsorship of the programme. Thus, the competition was opened up to many more schools to participate. In 2013, 66 out of the 81 invited schools participated. In 2014, the number of schools was increased to 135 to give the programme a truly national character. From 2014, 108 schools are selected from regional competitions to join 27 seeded schools (quarter-finalists from the previous year's competition) at the National Championships. 

==Quiz structure==
Three schools compete in each contest and each school is represented by two contestants. The quiz mistress is Dr. [[Elsie Effah Kaufmann]]. Currently, every contest is composed of five rounds with the following rules:

*'''Round 1''' — The round of fundamental questions. Each contesting school receives 4 Biology,  4 Chemistry,  4 Physics and 4 Mathematics questions,  totaling 16 to answer.  A wrongly answered question may be carried over as a bonus. Partial credit is sometimes possible.
*'''Round  2''' Now has a new round called the speed race
*'''Round 3''' — Problem of the day! The contestants are required to solve a single questions within 3 minutes. This question is worth 10 points.
*'''Round 4''' — '''True''' or '''False''' statements are given to the contestants in turns. The objective is to determine whether each statement is true or false. A correctly answered question fetches 2 points.  A wrongly answered questions attracts a penalty of -1 point. One may decide not to answer a question, in which case it will be carried over as a bonus for the full benefit of the two points.
*'''Round 5''' — '''Riddles'''; Clues are given to the contesting schools. The schools are to compete against each other to find the answers to the riddles. Getting the correct answer on the first clue fetches 5 points.  On the second clue, 4 points.  On the third or any other succeeding clue, 3 points. There are 4 riddles in all.

'''Malcolm Cuthbert Nokes''' MC MA BSc (20 May 1897 – 22 November 1986) was a British schoolteacher, soldier, research scientist and Olympic athlete, who competed in the [[hammer throw]] and [[discus throw]].

He won the bronze medal in the hammer throw at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]. Four years later he finished eleventh in the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics - Men's hammer throw|1928 Olympic hammer throw competition]]. In 1923 he beat the British hammer throw record, but did so in a demonstration rather than a competition, so his throw did not count for record purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepressb19230822-1.2.59.aspx "Record Hammer Throw"]. ''Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser'' (1884–1942), 22 August 1923, Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
He won the gold medal for England in the [[1930 British Empire Games]] in the hammer throw contest and finished fifth in the discus throw event. At the [[1934 British Empire Games]] he won again the gold medal in the hammer throw competition.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Nokes was the [[Amateur Athletic Association]] (AAA) Champion from 1923 to 1926 and placed second in 1921–22 and 1927–28.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; He was chairman of the AAA's Coaching Committee, and also a member of the [[Achilles Club]].

He was a graduate of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he studied chemistry and wrote a thesis on [[metaphenetidine]]. Nokes served in the [[World War I|Great War]] in the [[Royal Artillery]] in the trenches and then as an [[Air observer|observer]] in the [[Royal Flying Corps]]. He was awarded a [[Military Cross]] for his service,&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; becoming MC Nokes MC. In [[World War II|the Second World War]] he served as an officer in the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] (Training Branch) while a schoolmaster.&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette'', [https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37571/supplement/2398/data.pdf supplement], 21 May 1946. p. 2398. [[Royal Air Force]] service number 86246. Resigned commission 1 May 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught [[chemistry]] at [[Malvern College]] and later at [[Harrow School]], where he was appointed Head of Science; he had come to the attention of Harrow when two schools colocated during the Second World War, although they did not merge. His practical demonstrations of the reaction of [[sodium]] with water were popular and famous among his pupils. These often entailed an explosion as MC Nokes put more than the recommended quantity of sodium into the water, and as the smoke cleared and noise subsided, MC Nokes would say "Note the small report." He was a member of the [[The Association for Science Education|Science Masters' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v3oC1oIiBiEC&amp;pg=PA7 ''New Scientist'']. 26 December 1957. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Later he worked at [[Harwell]] and then was Head of Laboratories&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Nokes (1963) [https://archive.org/details/DemonstrationsInModernPhysics ''Demonstrations in Modern Physics''].

During his time at Harrow, he served as a councillor in what is now [[Harrow London Borough Council]], being elected as a Conservative for the ward of Harrow-on-the-Hill &amp; Greenhill.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Colin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13279">The '''Master of Social Work''' ('''MSW''') is a [[master's degree]] in the field of [[social work]]. It is a [[professional degree]] with specializations compared to [[Bachelor of Social Work]] (BSW). MSW promotes macro-, meso- and micro-aspects of professional social work practice, whereas the BSW focuses more on direct social work practices in community, hospitals ([[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient and inpatient]] services) and other fields of social services.

== Canada ==
In Canada, the MSW is considered a professional master's degree and is offered through several universities. Most schools are accredited by the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (C.A.S.W.E.).

All students entering an MSW program are required to have a recognized bachelor's degree in a related field. Generally, students with a Bachelor of Social Work would enroll in a one-year program, whereas those with other undergraduate degrees ([[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], etc.) would enroll in a two-year program. In Canada the average Master of Social Work graduate can earn anywhere from $60,000 CAD to $150,000 CAD, depending on their role and work environment.

The oldest social work program in Canada is offered at the [[University of Toronto]] through the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work. Social work students at the UofT choose from a number of specializations (i.e. gerontology, children and their families, mental health, social service administration, social justice and diversity), and have opportunities to pursue their MSW's with a variety of collaborative programs, such as Addiction Studies, Sexual Diversity Studies, and Asia-Pacific Studies, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/2year/yr2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528072518/http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/2year/yr2.htm |archivedate=2011-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/mswcollab.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528072521/http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/mswcollab.htm |archivedate=2011-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students could also pursue their MSW degrees in combination with either a Master of Health Science or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/mswcombined.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528072523/http://www.socialwork.utoronto.ca/programs/msw/mswcombined.htm |archivedate=2011-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, [[clinical social work]] could first be studied in academia as part of a certificate program beginning in 1908. Later, two and three year programs were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-social-sciences/social-policy/IASS/100-years-of-social-work.pdf 100 Years of Social Work] University of Birmingham, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Tavistock Clinic in London remains the leading centre for the study of clinically oriented social work and offers programmes up to and including Professional Doctorate level. The Journal of Social Work Practice represents the main organ of research and scholarly output in this area in the UK.

== United States ==
In the [[United States]], MSW degrees must be received from a [[graduate school]] that has been approved by the [[Council on Social Work Education]] (CSWE) should the graduate seek future licensure.  The MSW typically requires two years of full-time graduate study in combination with two years (900–1200 cumulative hours) of internship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Required Internship hours|url=http://www.cswe.org/File.aspx?id=13780|work=2008 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards|publisher=Council on Social Work Education|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to as field practicum, education, or experience. While some students obtain a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) before pursuing a master's, most MSW programs accept applicants with undergraduate degrees in a broad range of liberal arts fields. Some MSW programs provide BSW graduates with an advanced standing option, allowing them to complete an MSW in a shorter period of time (typically 1 year).

Most MSW programs allow students to choose a clinical or direct practice track, which focuses on direct practice with clients, or a macro practice track, with a focus on political advocacy, [[community organizing]], policy analysis and/or human services management. While the clinical track tends to be more popular, there has been a resurgence in community practice concentrations recently. There are also opportunities at many universities to obtain joint degrees, such as an MSW and a Public Administration degree, MSW and Public Health, or MSW and Law. The MSW practice scope has broadened in recent years to include the specialty practice areas of geriatrics and work with veterans. In some schools the curriculum is based on a generalist model which integrates the facets of the various practice areas within social work.

The MSW is considered a terminal practice degree in the field of social work.  The DSW (Doctorate of Social Work) and Ph.D in social work are the final degrees offered in the field of social work.  There are inherent differences between the DSW and the PhD; the DSW further develops skills to continue practice with individual clients and client systems in the field. The PhD prepares graduates to conduct research and teach in institutions of higher education. There are few DSW programs available in the United States.

Though Master of Social Work is by far the most common degree title used by graduate social work schools in the United States, it is not universal. For example, [[Columbia University School of Social Work]] offers an M.S. degree in social work, the School of Social Service Administration of the [[University of Chicago]] confers an A.M. degree, and the [[University of Texas]]  confers the MSSW (Master of Science in Social Work) degree. The [[Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences]] at [[Case Western Reserve University]] confers the MSSA (Master of Science in Social Administration) degree.

[[Clark Atlanta University]]'s [[Whitney M. Young]] School of Social work is also credited with creating the administration of social work from an Afro-centric perspective.  [[Clark Atlanta]]'s school of social work has also had various stalwarts in the profession affiliated with it such as [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], Dorcas Bowles, [[Whitney Young]], Hattie Mitchell, Naomi Ward and Rufus Lynch.

==Employment Outlook and Opportunities U.S.==

Although it is possible to be a [[social worker]] with a bachelor's degree in the U.S., some fields of practice require a master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/choices/|title=NASW Press|author=|date=|website=www.socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], the profession is expected to grow by 25% between 2010 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25% between 2010 and 2020|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Community-and-Social-Service/Social-workers.htm|work=2012 Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing elderly population is resulting in accelerated job growth among gerontology social workers. Social workers with a focus on mental health and substance abuse are currently in high demand as offenders are directed to treatment instead of jail time, a trend that is expected to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialwork.une.edu/resources/news/msw-jobs-outlook/|title=MSW Jobs Outlook {{!}} UNE Online|website=socialwork.une.edu|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A master's degree could be seen as a tool which will help to compete with tomorrow's job market. The Employment Projection shows that those with higher levels of education in the field tend to earn more than those with just a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment Projection|url=http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm|work=2012 Earnings and Unemployment Rates by Educational Attainment|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The median annual salary for social workers according to the 2016 [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] was $46,890, or $22.54 hourly.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/social-workers.htm#tab-1]'' Bureau Of Labor Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;
Between the years 2016 and 2026, the job outlook is projected to increase by 16%, which is 9% higher than the national job growth average.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Average salaries will vary depending on the specific field of social work itself. Those who seek employment as social workers in the [[healthcare industry]] typically average the highest salaries, ranging between $54,141-$65,489.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www1.salary.com/Medical-Social-Worker-MSW-Salary.html]''Salary.com&lt;/ref&gt;
By obtaining a license in the field of clinical social work, the salary ranges from $40,494 - $76,205 according to [[PayScale]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Licensed_Clinical_Social_Worker_(LCSW)/Salary#CareerPaths]'' PayScale&lt;/ref&gt;

Social workers' earnings varied according to their area of specialization and work environment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Worker Salary Guide|url=http://www.gradschools.com/search-programs/social-work-msw/social-worker-salary|publisher=Gradschools.com|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Michael Robert Collings was born on October 29, 1947 in [[Rupert, Idaho]].&lt;ref name="isfdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?6224|title=Michael R. Collings - Summary Bibliography|publisher=[[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]]|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Bakersfield College]] in 1967 with an [[Associate's degree]], then graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in English from [[Whittier College]] two years later. After graduating with a [[Master of Arts|Master's degree]] in [[English studies|English]] from the [[University of California, Riverside]] in 1973, Collings received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[English literature]] from UCR in 1977, specializing in [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[The Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="pepperdinebio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arachnid.pepperdine.edu/humteachered/faculty/collings/bio_info.html|title=Michael R.

Before he began teaching [[creative writing]] and [[literature]] at [[Pepperdine University]],&lt;ref name="fantfic"/&gt; Collings taught at UCR, [[San Bernardino Valley Community College]], and [[UCLA]]. He taught at Pepperdine from 1979&lt;ref name="pepperdinebio"/&gt; until 2010, when he retired. He now lives in Idaho with his wife, Judi. His son, [[Michaelbrent Collings]], is a fantasy and horror writer.

Collings was introduced to Stephen King's work by a student, [[David A. Engebretson]], in 1983, and published his first book on him, ''The Many Facets of Stephen King'', in 1985; reading King led to his also studying and publishing on Koontz and [[Robert R. McCammon|Robert McCammon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Lindbergh |url=https://www.theringer.com/2018/9/4/17815650/the-stephen-king-chroniclers |title=The King Chroniclers and the Reimagining of an Icon of American Letters |website=The Ringer |date=September 4, 2018 |accessdate=September 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Microworlds EX.jpg|frame|MicroWorlds Logo]]

'''''MicroWorlds''''' is a program that uses the  [[Logo (programming language)|Logo programming language]], a dialect of [[Lisp programming language]]. It uses a ''turtle'' object which can be moved around, given commands, and eventually make shapes or even an [[animation]].

It is part of a large set of dialects and implementations of Logo originating from the invention of [[Seymour Papert]] and aimed at triggering the development of abstract ideas by children through experimentation.    As a tool for learning, Logo is flexible and provides immediate feedback; it is both accessible to young users and robust enough to create sophisticated projects.   In original versions of Logo, Papert created a large 'turtle' that was programmed to move around the room by providing commands via the computer.

''MicroWorlds'' was designed by [http://www.lcsi.ca LCSI], a Canadian company, and can be used with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac]] computers.

==Syntax==

The following is an example of something written in Logo:

&lt;pre&gt;
to go.crazy
fd 90
lt 90
rt 180
fd 4999              
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the example above, the user has gone into a part of the program called the procedure page, which allows for longer series of commands, and therefore more complex programs can be written. In this program, the cursor moves forward 90 units, turns left 90 degrees, right 180 degrees and then moves forward 4999 units.

Another example is:

&lt;pre&gt;
to say.hi
announce [Hi!]
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this example, the user makes a dialog box appear, having the text of whatever is inside the brackets. In this case, the box would have "Hi!" written on it.

Commands can be written in one of two ways: using the procedures page or the command module. The command module allows for instructions to be executed immediately, whereas the procedures page holds instructions that are able to be referenced at any time (using the name written after the word "to" at the beginning of a procedure).

==Vocabulary==

Logo is based on real words in its 'language' so that they are easy to remember. An example of this is the 'forward' command. 'Forward' can be used in a program such as this:

{{sxhl|2=turtle|forward 50}}

This simple line indicates that the turtle referred to before will move 50 units of computer screen in the direction it is pointed. The unit of measurement for 'forward' is one pixel on the screen. 'Forward' can also be abbreviated as the command 'fd', so therefore can be used like this:

{{sxhl|2=turtle|fd 50}}

Other important navigation commands include:

;{{code|2=turtle|lt :x}} : turns the turtle left :x number of degrees

;{{code|2=turtle|rt :x}} : turns the turtle right :x number of degrees

;{{code|setpos [x y]}} : sets the position of the turtle in the coordinates of the screen, x being on the x axis, y on the y axis

;{{code|pd}} : sets the turtle's "pen" down, so that wherever it moves afterwards, it draws a line on the screen from where it started to where it ended up

;{{code|pu}} : sets the turtle's "pen" up, so that it does not draw a line anymore

;{{code|2=turtle|setsh :x}} : changes the picture the turtle appears as to be a picture that is either drawn in Micro Worlds itself or imported into the program. {{code|:x}} refers to the shape's number

This is only a brief example of the hundreds of commands in Micro Worlds.

==Versions==

MicroWorlds EX is a powerful app that introduces coding to students in upper primary school and middle school. MicroWorlds has the ability to execute multiple tasks independently, also called parallel processing. Several processes can be launched independently which is very helpful when creating multiple character animations and simulations. Extra features in MicroWorlds, for example a text editor, shape centre, melody centre and the ability to import pictures all work with the Logo aspects to create multimedia projects, video games and simulations.

LCSI also provides [[MicroWorlds JR]], an iconic version of Logo that allows younger children, who are non-readers, to learn to code.

Tom Walsh has written a school curriculum for MicroWorlds EX.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/tomwalshjrhome/|title=Teaching Contexts: ELL Project in Tanzania, Survey Research Curriculum, Computer Science Programming with Logo, and Resources for Gifted/Regular Education|last=Walsh|first=Thomas|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-study guide for use at home was written by Camille McCue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119177170.html Getting Started with Coding]&lt;/ref&gt;

MicroWorlds EX is available in many languages such as French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, Italian, Armenian and Greek.

MicroWorlds is used as the main component of the curriculum used by OpenWorld Learning, an educational non-profit based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.openworldlearning.org|title=OpenWorld Learning – Creating Possibilities Through Technology|website=OpenWorld Learning|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; that as of 2016 operated 11 elementary sites and three middle school sites in the Denver area. The organization provides a free after-school program to students interested in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math)]] education.

Microworlds EX can be used to make a variety of apps and interactive games.

|work=TechNet |publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between announcement and stable release, a number of [[Software release life cycle#Beta|Community Technology Preview]] (CTP) releases were made.

On March 27, 2015, Microsoft released Small Basic version 1.1,&lt;ref name="v1.1 release post" /&gt; which fixed a bug and upgraded the targeted [[.NET Framework]] version from version 3.5 to version 4.5.

Microsoft released Small Basic version 1.2 on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref name="v1.2 release post" /&gt; Version 1.2 was the first update after a four-year hiatus to introduce new features to Small Basic. The update added classes for working with Microsoft's [[Kinect]] motion sensors,&lt;ref name="v1.2 release post"/&gt; increased the number of languages supported by the included Dictionary object, and fixed a number of bugs.&lt;ref name="v1.2 download page"/&gt;

==Language==

In Small Basic, one writes the illustrative [["Hello, world!" program]] as follows:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vbnet"&gt;
TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World!")
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Microsoft Small Basic is [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]]. It supports [[Branch (computer science)|conditional branching]], [[Control flow#Loops|loop]] structures, and [[subroutine]]s for [[event (computing)|event]] handling.  [[Variable (computer science)|Variable]]s are [[Weak typing|weakly typed]] and [[Scope (computer science)|dynamic]] with no scoping rules.

===Conditional branching===
The following example demonstrates conditional branching. It requests the current temperature in [[Fahrenheit]] and comments on the answer.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vbnet"&gt;
TextWindow.Write("Enter the temperature today (in F): ")
temp = TextWindow.ReadNumber()
If temp &gt; 100 Then
  TextWindow.WriteLine("It is pretty hot.")
ElseIf temp &gt; 70 Then
  TextWindow.WriteLine("It is pretty nice.")
ElseIf temp &gt; 50 Then
  TextWindow.WriteLine("Don't forget your coat.")
Else
  TextWindow.WriteLine("Stay home.")
EndIf
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Looping===
This example demonstrates a loop. Starting from one and ending with ten, it multiplies each number by four and displays the result of multiplication.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vbnet"&gt;
TextWindow.WriteLine("Multiplication Tables")
For i = 1 To 10
  TextWindow.Write(i * 4)
EndFor

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[While loop|While]]&lt;/code&gt; [[While loop|loops]] are also supported, and the demonstrated &lt;code&gt;[[For loop|For]]&lt;/code&gt; [[For loop|loop]] can be augmented through the use of the &lt;code&gt;Step&lt;/code&gt; keyword. The &lt;code&gt;Step&lt;/code&gt; keyword is used in setting the value by which the counter variable, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, is incremented each iteration.

===Data types===
Small Basic supports basic [[data type]]s, like [[String literal|strings]], [[Integer (computer science)|integers]] and [[Floating point|decimals]], and will readily convert one type to another as required by the situation. In the example, both the &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ReadNumber&lt;/code&gt; methods read a string from the command line, but &lt;code&gt;ReadNumber&lt;/code&gt; rejects any non-numeric characters. This allows the string to be converted to a numeric type and treated as a number rather than a string by the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vbnet"&gt;
TextWindow.WriteLine("Enter your name:")
name = TextWindow.Read()

TextWindow.Write("Enter your age: ")
age = TextWindow.ReadNumber()

TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello " + name + "!")
TextWindow.WriteLine("In 5 years you will be " + ( age + 5 ) + " years old!")
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As Small Basic will readily convert between data types, numbers can be manipulated as strings and numeric strings as numbers. This is demonstrated through the second example.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vbnet"&gt;
TextWindow.WriteLine(Math.log("100")) 'Prints 2
TextWindow.WriteLine("100" + "3000") ' Prints 3100
TextWindow.WriteLine("Windows " + 8) ' Prints Windows 8
TextWindow.WriteLine(Text.GetLength(1023.42)) ' Prints 7 (length of decimal representation including decimal point)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In the second example, both strings are treated as numbers and added together, producing the output 3100. To [[Concatenation|concatenate]] the two values, producing the output 1003000, it is necessary to use the &lt;code&gt;Text.Append(''text1'', ''text2'')&lt;/code&gt; method.

==Libraries==

=== Standard library ===

The Small Basic [[standard library]] includes basic classes for mathematics, [[string handling]], and [[input/output]], as well as more exotic classes that are intended to make using the language more fun for learners. Examples of these include a [[Turtle graphics]] class, a class for retrieving photos from [[Flickr]], and classes for interacting with Microsoft Kinect sensors.

To make the classes easier to use for learners, they have been simplified. This simplification is demonstrated through the code used to retrieve a random mountain-themed image from Flickr:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vbnet"&gt;For i = 1 To 10
  pic = Flickr.GetRandomPicture("mountains")
  Desktop.SetWallPaper(pic)
  Program.Delay(10000)
EndFor
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== Turtle graphics ====

Small Basic includes a "Turtle" graphics library that borrows from the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] family of programming languages. For example, to draw a square using the turtle, the turtle is moved forward by a given number of pixels and rotated 90 degrees in a given direction. This action is then repeated four times to draw the four sides of the square.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vbnet"&gt;
For i = 1 to 4
  Turtle.Move(100) ' Forward 100 pixels
  Turtle.Turn(90) ' Turn 90 degrees right
EndFor
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

More complex drawings are possible by altering the turning angle of the turtle and the number of iterations of the loop. For example, one can draw a [[hexagon]] by setting the turn angle to 60 degrees and the number of iterations to six.

=== Third-party libraries ===
Small Basic allows the use of third-party libraries. These libraries must be written in a [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]]-compatible language, and the compiled binaries must target a compatible .NET Framework version. The classes provided by the library are required to be [[Static variable|static]], flagged with a specific [[Metadata (CLI)#Attributes|attribute]], and must use a specific data type.

An example of a class to be used in Small Basic is provided below, written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="csharp"&gt;[SmallBasicType]
public static class ExampleClass
{
    public static Primitive Add(Primitive A, Primitive B) =&gt; A + B;

    public static Primitive SomeProperty
    {
        get;
        set;
    }

    public static Primitive Pi =&gt; (Primitive)3.14159;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

If available, the Small Basic development environment will display documentation for third-party libraries. The development environment accepts documentation in the form of an [[XML]] file, which can be automatically generated from source code comments by tools such as [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] and [[MonoDevelop]].

A '''nurse educator''' is a nurse who teaches and prepares [[licensed practical nurse]]s (LPN) and [[registered nurse]]s (RN) for entry into practice positions.  They can also teach in various patient care settings to provide continuing education to licensed nursing staff. Nurse Educators teach in graduate programs at [[Master of Science in Nursing|Master’s]] and [[Doctor of Nursing Science|doctoral]] level which prepare [[advanced practice nurse]]s, nurse educators, [[Nursing management|nurse administrators]], [[Nursing research|nurse researchers]], and leaders in complex healthcare and educational organizations.

The type of degree required for a nurse educator may be dependent upon the governing nurse practice act or upon the regulatory agencies that define the practice of nursing. In the United States, one such agency is the [[National Council of State Boards of Nursing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncsbn.org/boards.htm NCSBN website]&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, faculty in the U.S. may be able to teach in an LPN program with an associate degree in nursing.  Most baccalaureate and higher degree programs require a minimum of a graduate degree and prefer the doctorate for full-time teaching positions. Many nurse educators have a clinical specialty background blended with coursework in education. Many schools offer the Nurse Educator track which focuses on educating nurses going into any type setting.  Individuals may complete a post-Master’s certificate in education to complement their clinical expertise if they choose to enter a faculty role.

Nurse educators can choose to teach in a specialized field of their choosing. There is not extra degree needed to be earned other than a Master's degree in nursing. Most schools will only hire a nurse to teach a class if they have had experience in that area. This is so the students can have a better understanding of the current subject being taught.

In Australia, Nurse Educators must be Registered Nurses (RNs/Division 1 Nurses).  The Nurse Educator role is not available to Enrolled Nurses (ENs/Division 2 Nurses).
Nurse Educators require a minimum of a Certificate IV in Training and Assessment to teach the Diploma of Nursing in both the classroom and clinical placement settings.  Bachelor of Nursing Educators do not technically require this qualification, but it is generally favoured.  A Nurse Educator may also complete post-graduate university study in Nursing or Clinical Education, which may lead to an academic career including research, lecturing or doctoral study.
To become a Clinical Nurse Educator in a healthcare setting (e.g on an acute care ward), Registered Nurses are generally required to have 5-10 years clinical experience and 6-8 years of study (a bachelor degree plus post-graduate certificate or diploma).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5674">The '''Plowden Report''' is the unofficial name for the 1967 report of the [[Central Advisory Council For Education]] (England) into [[Primary education]] in England. The report, entitled ''Children and their Primary Schools'', reviewed [[primary education]] in a wholesale fashion. The collation of the report took around 3 years. The Council was chaired by [[Bridget Plowden|Bridget, Lady Plowden]] after whom the report is named.

==Context==
The report was commissioned by [[Minister of Education|Education minister]], [[Edward Boyle, Baron Boyle of Handsworth|Sir Edward Boyle]] in 1963. He requested that the council "consider primary education in all its aspects and the transition to secondary education." [http://www.dg.dial.pipex.com/documents/plowden00.shtml]

At that time, the last such investigation into the nature of primary education had been undertaken by the [[Hadow Committee]] led by Sir [[William Henry Hadow]] in the early 1930s.  During the time of collating the report, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Government]] of the day introduced [[circular 10/65]] requesting that [[local education authority|local education authorities]] submit plans to replace the [[Tripartite System|tripartite system]] and [[eleven-plus exam|11-plus]] with [[comprehensive school]]ing. The administration also made clear its intention to [[Raising Of School Leaving Age|raise school-leaving age]] to 16 (from the then 15).

In the years leading up to, and during the collation of the report, prevalent thinking in educational psychology was highly influenced by the work of such people as [[Jean Piaget]] who published a seminal work on the matter in 1962.

==Main findings==
The report was widely known for its praising of [[child-centred]] approaches to education, stressing that "at the heart of the educational process lies the child".

Recommendations in the report included those listed below:
* All schools should have a programme for contact with children's homes (Ch. 4)
* Primary schools should be used as fully as possible out of ordinary hours (Ch. 5)
* A national policy of 'positive discrimination' should favour schools in deprived neighbourhoods (Ch. 5)
* Training college should expand opportunities for teachers to train in teaching English to immigrants (Ch. 6)
* Surveys of primary education should be undertaken every 10 years (Ch. 8)
* Nursery education should be available to children at any time after they reach the age of three (Ch. 9)
* A three-tier system of [[First school|first]], [[Middle school|middle]] and [[Secondary school]]s, with transfer at ages 8 and 12. (Ch. 10)
* Authorities maintaining selection should not rely on intelligence and attainment tests. (Ch. 11)
* The infliction of physical pain as a method of punishment in primary schools should be forbidden. (Ch. 19)
* The maximum size of primary school classes should be reduced (Ch. 20)
* The term 'slow learner' should be substituted for 'educationally sub-normal'. (Ch. 21)
* More men teachers are needed in primary schools (Ch. 25)

==Implementation==

By the time the report was returned to the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]], the change of government had led to the appointment of [[Anthony Crosland]] as minister. He received the report in 1967, but implementation of the recommendations was piecemeal.

In some areas, local education authorities implemented changes themselves, such as the introduction of three-tier education systems in many places. Similarly, over the 40 years, many of the recommendations which first appeared in the report, have evolved and appeared in legislation under other guises, such as the widespread  introduction of state-funded [[nursery school|nursery provision]], Extended Schools, requirement for a Home School Agreement to be presented (but not signed), the ban on corporal punishment, ESOL programmes,  [[Educational Action Zone]]s and most of all the comprehensive system. However the three-tier system is now uncommon in Britain with a two-tier system of primary school followed by a transition aged 11 to secondary school being normal. The system of children transferring to secondary school at the age of 12 has now been almost completely abandoned.

Male teachers remain a small minority in primaries.

==New Primary Review==
A new review of primary education in England began on 2 October 2006 under the leadership of Professor Robin Alexander under the title [[Primary Review|The Primary Review]].

==Primary sources==
The official records of the Plowden committee are held in the records created or inherited by the Department of Education and Science, and of related bodies [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]. The personal papers of Bridget Horatia Plowden, including records regarding the Plowden Report are held in the Archives of the [[Institute of Education]], University of London, (Ref: DC/PL) [http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=9347&amp;9347_0=15327].

The '''Qemal Stafa High School''' is a high school, located in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]].

Founded in 1925 by then Prime Minister [[Ahmet Zogu]], as the ''Lyceum of Tirana'', it has many notable alumni, of whom 75 died in World War II and 13 were awarded the title [[People's Hero of Albania]] during World War II.&lt;ref name="official website"&gt;{{cite web|last=Q.

'''Robert Neelly Bellah''' (1927–2013) was an American [[sociology|sociologist]] and the Elliott Professor of Sociology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was internationally known for his work related to the [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref name="Hartford Institute"&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Web Pages Dedicated to the Work of Robert N. Bellah |url=http://www.robertbellah.com |location=Hartford, Connecticut |publisher=Hartford Seminary |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Bellah graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard College]] in 1950, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in social relations with a concentration in [[social anthropology]].{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=182}} His undergraduate honors thesis won the Phi Beta Kappa Prize and was later published in 1952 with the title ''Apache Kinship Systems''.{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1a2=Tipton |1y=2006 |1p=523 |2a1=Bortolini |2a2=Cossu |2y=2015 |2p=39}}

Bellah graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in a joint sociology and Far East languages program, with [[Talcott Parsons]] and John Pelzel as his advisors,{{sfn|Bortolini|2010|p=7}} respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Bellah first encountered the work of [[Talcott Parsons]] as an undergraduate when his senior honors thesis advisor was [[David Aberle]], a former student of Parsons.{{sfn|Bortolini|2010|p=7}} Parsons was specially interested in Bellah's concept of religious evolution and the concept of "civil religion". They remained intellectual friends until Parsons' death in 1979.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1955.{{sfnm |1a1=Giesen |1a2=Šuber |1y=2005 |1p=49 |2a1=Yamane |2y=1998}} His doctoral dissertation was titled ''Religion and Society in Tokugawa Japan'' and was an extension of Weber's [[Protestant ethic]] thesis to Japan. It was published as ''Tokugawa Religion'' in 1957.

While an undergraduate at Harvard, Bellah was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] from 1947 to 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bellah |first=Robert N. |year=2005 |title=McCarthyism at Harvard |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/02/10/mccarthyism-at-harvard/ |magazine=The New York Review of Books |volume=52 |issue=2 |issn=0028-7504 |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a chairman of the [[John Reed Club]], "a recognized student organization concerned with the study of [[Marxism]]".&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Bellah |first1=Robert N. |last2=Bundy |first2=McGeorge |author2-link=McGeorge Bundy |last3=Kerr |first3=Clark |author3-link=Clark Kerr |last4=Cohen |first4=Marshall |last5=Conway |first5=John |last6=Doty |first6=Paul |display-authors=5 |year=1977 |title='Veritas' at Harvard: Another Exchange |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1977/jul/14/veritas-at-harvard-another-exchange/ |magazine=The New York Review of Books |volume=24 |issue=12 |issn=0028-7504 |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1954, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard [[McGeorge Bundy]], who later served as a national security adviser to [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], threatened to withdraw Bellah's graduate student fellowship if he did not provide the names of his former club associates.&lt;ref name="NYT: Obituary"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fox |first=Margalit |author-link=Margalit Fox |date=August 6, 2013 |title=Robert Bellah, Sociologist of Religion Who Mapped the American Soul, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/us/robert-bellah-sociologist-of-religion-who-mapped-the-american-soul-dies-at-86.html |url-access=limited |work=The New York Times |access-date=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellah was also interrogated by the Boston office of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] with the same purpose. As a result, Bellah and his family spent two years in Canada, where he was awarded a [[post-doctoral fellowship]] at the [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies|Islamic Institute in McGill University]] in [[Montreal]]. He returned to Harvard after [[McCarthyism]] declined due to the death of its main instigator senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Bellah afterwards wrote,

{{quote|... I know from personal experience that Harvard did some terribly wrong things during the McCarthy period and that those things have never been publicly acknowledged. At its worst it came close to psychological terror against almost defenseless individuals. ...The university and the secret police were in collusion to suppress political dissent and even to persecute dissenters who had changed their minds if they were not willing to become part of the persecution.&lt;ref name="ny" /&gt;}}

==Career==
Bellah's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''Religion in Human Evolution'' (2011),{{sfnm |1a1=Miles |1y=2013 |1pp=853, 862 |2a1=Stausberg |2y=2014 |2p=281}} traces the biological and cultural origins of religion and the interplay between the two. The sociologist and philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] wrote of the work: "This great book is the intellectual harvest of the rich academic life of a leading social theorist who has assimilated a vast range of biological, anthropological, and historical literature in the pursuit of a breathtaking project&amp;nbsp;... In this field I do not know of an equally ambitious and comprehensive study."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061439&amp;content=reviews | title=About Religion in Human Evolution | publisher=Harvard University Press | accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book won the Distinguished Book Award of the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Section on Sociology of Religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sociology of Religion Section Award Recipients |url=http://www.asanet.org/asa-communities/asa-sections/current-sections/religion/section-sociology-religion-award-recipients |publisher=American Sociological Association |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellah is best-known for his 1985 book ''Habits of the Heart'',&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=robert+bellah&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C7&amp;as_sdtp=&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification failed|date=September 2018}}--&gt; which discusses how religion contributes to and detracts from America's common good, and for his studies of religious and moral issues and their connection to society. Bellah was perhaps best known for his work related to [[American civil religion]], a term which he coined in a 1967 article that has since gained widespread attention among scholars.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}&lt;ref name="Woo 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=August 3, 2013 |title=Robert N.

He served in various positions at Harvard from 1955 to 1967 when he took the position of Ford Professor of Sociology at the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. He spent the remainder of his career at Berkeley.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} His views are often classified as [[communitarian]].{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1y=1998 |2a1=Dorrien |2y=1995 |2pp=336–343 |3a1=Eberly |3y=1998 |3p=108}} An academic biography of Robert Bellah, "the world's most widely read sociologist of religion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bergman |first=Barry |date=October 26, 2006 |title=Of God, Justice, and Disunited States |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2006/10/26_Bellah.shtml |work=The Berkeleyan |location=Berkeley, California |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is currently under way.{{sfnm |1a1=Bortolini |1y=2010 |2a1=Bortolini |2y=2011 |3a1=Bortolini |3y=2012}}

==Personal==
Bellah was born in [[Altus, Oklahoma|Altus]], [[Oklahoma]], on February 23, 1927.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=182}} His father was a newspaper editor and publisher and died when he was two years old.{{sfn|Horowitz|2005|p=218}} His mother Lillian moved the family to [[Los Angeles]],{{sfn|Horowitz|2005|p=218}} where she had relatives.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Bellah grew up in Los Angeles{{sfn|Giesen|Šuber|2005|p=49}} and attended [[Los Angeles High School]], where he and his future wife, Melanie Hyman, were editors of the student newspaper. They got married in 1948 after she graduated from [[Stanford University]], and he began studying at Harvard University after a service in the [[US Army]]. Bellah's wife died in 2010.

Bellah was briefly a [[communism|communist]] during his student years at Harvard, as he recalled in 1977 in a letter to the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' regarding [[McCarthyism]] at the university:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Harvard's capitulation to McCarthyism is still being defended as a form of resistance to McCarthyism. An account of my experiences will, I believe, support [Sigmund] Diamond's and not [[McGeorge Bundy|[McGeorge] Bundy]]'s interpretation of those years.
I was a member of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]] as a Harvard undergraduate from 1947 to 1949. During that period I was mainly involved in the [[John Reed Club]], a recognized student organization concerned with the study of [[Marxism]]. In that connection I might recount an incident that indicates that a difference between a public policy and a private policy at Harvard such as Diamond has suggested may already have begun in 1949. According to [[Seymour Martin Lipset|[Seymour Martin] Lipset]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1949, the John Reed Club sponsored a talk by a well-known Communist, [[Gerhart Eisler]], who was on his way to a job in East Germany after having been convicted for contempt of Congress. When the University was attacked for allowing students to be corrupted, [[Wilbur Bender]], then Dean of Harvard College, defended the students' right to hear, stating: "If Harvard students can be corrupted by an Eisler, Harvard College had better shut down as an educational institution...[p. 182]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was, I believe, chairman of the John Reed Club at the time and was informed shortly after we announced that Eisler would speak that the university was considering forbidding the meeting and that the chairman and executive committee of the Club were asked to meet with an administrative officer. The administrator told us in the strongest terms that the invitation was extremely embarrassing for Harvard and asked us for the good of the school to withdraw the invitation. When we stood fast he told us that quite probably none of us would ever get jobs if we persisted in our course of action. The Harvard administration was attempting to do privately and indirectly what it would not do publicly and brazenly, namely suppress freedom of speech, which was precisely the aim of [[Joseph McCarthy|[Joseph] McCarthy]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bellah was fluent in Japanese and literate in Chinese, French, and German, and later studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at [[McGill University]] in Montreal.

Bellah died July 30, 2013, at an [[Oakland, California]], hospital from complications after [[heart surgery]]. He was 86 and is survived by his daughters Jennifer Bellah Maguire and Hally Bellah-Guther; a sister, Hallie Reynolds; and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name="Woo 2013"/&gt; Raised as a [[Presbyterian]], he converted to [[Episcopalianism]].&lt;ref name="NYT: Obituary"/&gt;

'''Ronald Stephen Horan''' ([[Sydney]], 27 August 1924 – 7 September 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maccem.com.au/ Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium ]&lt;/ref&gt; was an Australian [[linguist]], educator and author for over forty years. He was the author of language course texts in three languages, both on his own and with two co-authors. He was later in his life a historian, particularly of [[Fort Street High School]] in Sydney, Australia. Horan was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in 2000, and in 2001 an annual award in French studies was established in his honour, "the Ron Horan Prize for French", through the Faculty of Arts at Sydney University.

==Education and early career==
Ron Horan was born in Sydney, and had his secondary education at [[Fort Street High School|Fort Street Boys' High School]] just before and in the early years of the Second World War. He then entered the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Sydney]] but he interrupted his studies to serve in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) for three years as a [[radar]] operator and finally trained as an officer and translator. After the war he completed his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, majoring in French (Honours) and German. He later gained a Diploma in Education. After a short appointment at Sydney Boys' High School, his "country service", he joined the staff of Fort Street, where he taught for 36 years. Many of those years were spent as modern languages master and he later became deputy principal. His teaching subjects were French, German and English.

As a practical guide for students he compiled the ''Fort Street Speller'', which is presented to all pupils upon their arrival at the school. This guide has made its way into many avenues of public administration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Ron Horan has also been actively involved in the broader sphere of education. He served for ten years as a teacher and deputy principal at Eastwood Evening College and then a further 22 years as its principal. With co-authors, he has published French and German language course books, which are widely used in Australia and around the world.

==Books==

Horan was an author of language textbooks which have been popular in Australia and abroad for decades.

With John Wheeler, he co-authored "Senior French" in two volumes, first published in 1961, later to become "A New French Course", in five volumes, that is still a standard in school education and the [[University of the Third Age]]. This junior to senior French textbook chronicled the life of the Ravel family and is still in print. Later, with John Slinn, he co-authored "A New German Course" in two parts. And still later, after his retirement, Horan wrote the "English Series", an exploration of the English language for all learners comprising "Spelling English", "Exploring English" and "Using English".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnspace.com.au/ ''The English Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; This series is in its second edition in hard copy and new e-book format.

In the mid 1960s, in co-operation with the Phillips Corporation, he built one of the first [[Language lab|Language Laboratories]] in the world at Fort Street. He also recorded vinyl disc, magnetic tape and cassette recordings to accompany these resources.

Horan served on many education committees, and was president of the [[Australian Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations]] (AFMLTA).

After he had retired he wrote books about the school with "Fort Street, the School" being followed by "Maroon and Silver".

==Awards and recognition==

In honour of his work with these students and in regard to the history of the school in general, in 2007 the "Ron Horan History Room" was inaugurated by the 1955 year students.

In 1949 Ron Horan married Elmire and they had two sons, Rodney and David. The family lived in the Hills area of Sydney.

Horan was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia|OAM]] in 2000, and in 2001 an annual award  was established in his honour in French studies "the Ron Horan Prize for French" through the Faculty of Arts at Sydney University.

== Early life ==
Woodsmall was born in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on September 20, 1883, the youngest of three children of Harrison S. Woodsmall, a lawyer and teacher, and Mary Elizabeth Howes, an art teacher. She grew up in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] and attended local schools. She received her [[Bachelor's degree|A.B.]] from the [[University of Nebraska system|University of Nebraska]] in 1905 and her [[Master's degree|A.M.]] from [[Wellesley College]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="Smith Collection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/ssc/ywca-os/woodsmall.html|title=Ruth Frances Woodsmall (1883-1963)|work=Sophia Smith Collection|publisher =Smith College Libraries|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
From 1906 to 1917 Woodsmall worked as a high school English teacher and principal in [[Nevada]] and [[Colorado]]. From 1917 to 1928 and 1932 to 1948, Woodsmall held various positions with the National and World YWCA. As a member of the National Board of the YWCA of the United States, she worked with the War Work Council directing Hostess Houses in the United States and France during World War I. From 1918 to 1920 she did post war work and field studies of the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] and [[Balkans|Balkan]] countries. In 1920 Woodsmall became executive secretary of the [[Near East|Near]] and [[Middle East]], a post she held until 1928.&lt;ref name="Smith Collection" /&gt;

In 1928 she received a traveling fellowship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to conduct a study of the changing status of Moslem women in the Middle East. Her 1930 report was later published in 1936 as ''Moslem Women Enter a New World''. In 1930 Woodsmall participated in the [[Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's Inquiry after One Hundred Years|Laymen's Foreign Mission Inquiry]], an independent [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] project of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches to assess missionaries' record in converting non-western populations. Her ''Eastern Women Today and Tomorrow'' (1933) contained the results of this project. In 1932 Woodsmall returned to the YWCA as staff specialist for the National Board, and in 1935 she became General Secretary for the World YWCA, a post she held until 1947. Between 1947 and 1948 she did special service for the YWCA in Japan.&lt;ref name="Smith Collection" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender, Modernity and Liberty: Middle Eastern and Western Women's Writings|author=Reina Lewis and Nancy Micklewright|publisher=I. B. Tauris &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=2006|ISBN=1-86064-956-4|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Woodsmall became Chief of the Women's Affairs Section of the U.S. High Commission for Occupied Germany, a position she held until 1952. She was appointed by the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] to the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] for two sessions in 1949 and 1952. In 1951 she was a member of the UNESCO Working Party on the Equality of Access of Women to Education. In the years following her retirement she continued her research and writings, updating her earlier research in ''Study of the Role of Women, Their Activities and Organizations in Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Syria'' (1955) and ''Women and the New East'' (1960).&lt;ref name="Smith Collection" /&gt;

Woodsmall died in New York City on May 25, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00773.html?a=1&amp;n=woodsmall&amp;d=10&amp;ss=0&amp;q=1 Ruth Frances Woodsmall]" in ''American National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 1998) and ''Notable American Women: the Modern Period (volume IV)'', Belknap Press, Harvard University, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on other authors==
Woodsmall's work has been cited as source material by other authors, such as Samuel Hugh Moffett in ''A History of Christianity in Asia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Christianity in Asia, Vol. II: 1500-1900|author=Samual Hugh Moffett|publisher=Orbis Books|date=March 30, 2005|ISBN=978-1570757013|page=722}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Laura E. Donaldson in ''Postcolonialism, Feminism and Religious Discourse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminism and Religious Discourse|author=[[Kwok Pui-Lan]] and Laura E. Donaldson|publisher=Routledge|date=November 4, 2001|ISBN=978-0415928885|pages=83, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''American Christians and Islam'', Thomas S. Kidd quoted Woodsmall's ''Muslem Women Enter a New World'', in which she attributed the oppressed condition of Islamic women to a "spirit of fatalism". He also noted her hope that education would "bring religion in accord with modern needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Christians and Islam|author=Thomas S. Kidd|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=October 27, 2008|pages=50, 402|ISBN=978-0691133492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work continued to be published after her death, with reprints of ''Moslem Women Enter A New World'' in 1975&lt;ref&gt;AMS Press (1975), ASIN: B007ETV5ZY&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010,&lt;ref&gt;Kessinger Publishing, LLC (September 10, 2010),{{ISBN|978-1163196090}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Women in the changing Islamic system'' in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Bilma Pub.

'''Samuel Isaac Joseph Schereschewsky''' (pronounced skĕr-ĕs-kūs'kĭ {{zh|c=施約瑟|myr=''Shi Yuese''}}; 6 May 1831 – 15 October 1906), also known as '''Joseph Schereschewsky''', was the [[Anglican diocese of Shanghai|Anglican Bishop of Shanghai]], [[China]], from 1877 to 1884. He founded [[St. John's University, Shanghai]], in 1879.

==Early years==
Schereschewsky was born in [[Tauroggen]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Lithuania]], on 6 May 1831.  He appears to have been named for his father. His mother was Rosa Salvatha. Orphaned as a young boy, it is speculated he was raised by a half-brother who was a timber merchant in good circumstance. Having shown himself to be a promising student, he was given the best education available and it was his family's intention that he become a [[rabbi]]. From the time he left his brother's house at 15, he was obliged to support himself as a tutor and as a [[glazier]]. It was at the rabbinical school in [[Zhytomyr]] that he was given a copy of the [[New Testament]] in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] which had been produced by the [[London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews]]. The study of that gradually convinced him that in [[Jesus]] the [[Messiah|Messianic]] prophecies of the [[Old Testament]] and the age-long hopes of his people had been fulfilled. At 19 he went to [[Germany]] where he studied for a year or more at [[Frankfurt]] and for two years at the [[University of Breslau]]. To his fluency in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] he added [[German language|German]], which he spoke like a native for the rest of his life.{{sfnp|Eber|1999|pp=19-24}}

==Road to China==
In 1854 he decided to emigrate to the [[United States]]. In [[New York City]] he connected with [[Messianic Jews|Christian Jews]] but did not enter the Christian Church until 1855 when he was baptized by immersion and associated with a [[Baptist]] congregation. For reasons unknown he then became a [[Presbyterian]] and went to the Western Theological Seminary of the Presbyterian Church at [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]]. (WTS is now Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. He matriculated as Samuel_Isaac_Joseph, ostensibly to avoid anti-Semitism.) After more than two years he left to enter the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] and the [[General Theological Seminary]], where he found a mentor in the professor of Hebrew, [[Samuel H. Turner]]. His plan to complete his remaining two years of study was interrupted when he offered himself for work in China.  On 3 May 1859 the Foreign Committee voted that he be appointed missionary to China as soon as he was ordained. He was ordained as a deacon on 17 July 1859 at [[St. George's Church, New York]] by Bishop [[William Jones Boone (father)|William Jones Boone]].

==Career in China==
Schereschewsky arrived in Shanghai on 21 December 1859 on the ship ''Golden Rule'' with Bishop Boone. On 28 October 1860 Bishop Boone ordained him to the priesthood in the mission school chapel, later known as the Church of our Savior, [[Hongkew]].  He served in [[Peking]] from 1862, including on the Peking Translation Committee.{{sfnp|Eber|1999|pp=85-136}}

By 1861, Schereschewsky had begun his [[Bible translations into Chinese]]. The first was of the [[Psalm]]s into the [[Shanghai dialect]]. He later translated the [[Book of Common Prayer]] into Mandarin with English missionary [[John Shaw Burdon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-no97-77154 WorldCat Listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to the United States for health reasons in 1875, and refused a call to become missionary bishop of Shanghai, since bishop [[Channing Moore Williams]] had requested division of his huge episcopate (including both China and Japan). However, two years later, Schereschewsky accepted the call to that bishopric from the Episcopal House of Bishops, after receiving assurances of financial support for his dream of building a college to educate Chinese in Shanghai. Schereschewsky was consecrated Bishop in [[Grace Church (Manhattan)|Grace Church]], New York, on October 31, 1877&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stsams.org/patron.htm|title =THE CYBERPARISH of SAINT SAM |accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later founded St. John's College (later renamed [[Saint John's University, Shanghai|St. John's University]]). He served as [[Anglican diocese of Shanghai|Bishop of Shanghai]] until 1883, when he resigned his bishopric for health reasons (having become increasingly incapacitated after suffering a sun stroke in 1881).

He returned to the United States with the understanding that he could return to China as translator as his health permitted. That he did in 1895, although he became "paralysed in every limb, and with his powers of speech partly gone, sitting for nearly twenty-five years in the same chair, slowly and painfully typing out with two fingers his Mandarin translation of the Old Testament and Easy Wen-li translation of the whole Bible"{{sfnb|Broomhall|1907| p = 374}} His new translations of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Mandarin were published in 1898-1899. However, Schereschewsky yearned to complete a new translation of the Bible into Wenli, China's classical language, finding the previous five attempts inaccurate and some even lapsing into paganism (1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Encyclopedia Americana| url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Encyclopedia_Americana_%281920%29 |chapter = Schereschewsky, Samuel Isaac Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://anglicanhistory.org/asia/china/bishops1908 BISHOP SCHERESCHEWSKY]" Project Canterbury, The Bishops of the American Church Mission in China, Hartford, Connecticut: Church Missions Publishing Co., 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued his translation work, with the assistance of an amanuensis in Chinese and later Japanese, when he moved to Tokyo, Japan during his final decade. A contemporary called him "Probably the greatest Bible translator China ever had".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |p = 442 |first = Marshall, ed.|last = Broomhall |year = 1907 |title= The Chinese Empire: A General and Missionary Survey | place = London |publisher = Morgan and Scott |url = https://archive.org/details/chineseempiregen1907broo| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Schereschewsky died on 15 October 1906 and is buried in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. St. John's University, which Schereschewsky began with 39 students, mostly taught in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In 1891, it changed to teaching in [[English language|English]] and the courses began to focus on science and natural philosophy.

==Veneration==
Schereschewsky is honored with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on 14 October.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diobeth.typepad.com/files/holy-women-holy-men.pdf ''Holy Women, Holy Men''] p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2337">'''Shokuiku''' ([[Kanji]]: 食育) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for "[[food]] [[education]]". The law defines it as the "acquisition of knowledge about food and [[nutrition]], as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]".

It was initiated by [[Sagen Ishizuka]], a famous military doctor and pioneer of the [[macrobiotic diet]]. Following the introduction of Western [[fast food]] in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008. Universities have established programs to teach shokuiku in public schools, as well as investigating its effectiveness through academic study.&lt;ref name="GotoMurayama2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goto|first1=Keiko|last2=Murayama|first2=Nobuko|last3=Honda|first3=Sayaka|title=The Perceived Roles of Fast Foods and Shokuiku (Food and Nutrition Education) in Healthy and Sustainable Food Practices in Japan|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior|volume=41|issue=4|year=2009|pages=S2–S3|issn=14994046|doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2009.03.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Major concerns that led to the development of shokuiku law include:
* Schoolchildren skipping breakfast.
* Children purchasing meals at a convenience store instead of eating with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;http://web-japan.org/trends/buzz/bz0601.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Families not eating meals together.

Classes in shokuiku will study the processes of making food, such as farming or fermentation; how additives create flavor; and where food comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Frank. "[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006150011/en   Food and Education II : The Shokuiku in English Project]". ''Bulletin of Keiwa College'' 15 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''Tennessee Higher Education Commission''' '''(THEC)''' was established by the [[Tennessee General Assembly]] in 1967 to coordinate and support the efforts of [[higher education]] institutions in the [[Tennessee|State of Tennessee]]. One of its statutory requirements is to create a master plan for developing public higher education in Tennessee.

==Purposes==

THEC's stated mission is to be “relentlessly focused on increasing the number of Tennesseans with a post-secondary credential.” The agency, a traditional higher education coordinating board, serves several important functions, including: 
Development and proponency for the state public agenda for higher education; 
Administration of the outcomes based funding formula, a method by which appropriations are distributed to public colleges and universities; Approval of all new academic programs; Formulation and recommendations for capital project funding; General higher education policy development 

THEC is a combined agency with the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation, the state financial aid agency, and the THEC Executive Director holds a dual appointment as leader of both entities.
 
In recent years, THEC has emerged as a central leader for higher education efforts in the state, reinforced substantially by the Complete College Tennessee Act of 2010 and the FOCUS Act of 2016. 

THEC is the official approving agency in Tennessee for any postsecondary institution, public or private, desiring to enroll students receiving veterans' benefits from the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] such as those available under the [[G. I. Bill of Rights]].

==Composition==

The Tennessee Higher Education Commission is composed of one "lay" member from each of the state's nine [[United States House of Representatives|Congressional]] districts, appointed to six-year terms, the three [[Tennessee State Constitution|state constitution]]al officers ([[Tennessee Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], State [[Treasurer]] and Comptroller of the Treasury), two student commissioners serving staggered two-year terms (one each from the [[University of Tennessee system]] and the [[Tennessee Board of Regents]] system, with voting rights only during the second year of the term, assuring only one voting student-member at a time), and the executive director of the State [[Board of education|Board of Education]], a nonvoting member.  With a maximum total vote of 13 at any one time, the majority required for action to be taken is usually seven votes.

In fall of 2018, a CBS News investigation of Woz U cast some doubts on the professionalism of the expensive curriculum. CBS interviewed two dozen current and former students and employees, who shared their dissatisfaction with the content quality, such as documentation typos leading to confusing program errors, while some promised live lectures were actually recorded and out-of-date. One student described the 33-week online program as "a $13,000 e-book". A former "enrollment counselor" described a high-pressure sales environment, which the company denied. In a prepared statement, Woz U president Chris Coleman admitted the documentation errors and said quality control efforts were being implemented, and said curriculum was reviewed by Wozniak. The founder declined interview requests, then dodged a reporter's unannounced appearance at a conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woz-u-steve-wozniak-former-students-employees-raise-concerns/|title=Some former students, employees say Apple co-founder's Woz U doesn't live up to promises|last=|first=|date=2018-10-01|work=CBS News|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/steve-wozniaks-woz-u-is-a-13000-e-book-former-students-say/|title=Steve Wozniak’s Woz U is 'a $13,000 e-book,' former students say|last=Zhou|first=Marrian|date=2018-10-01|work=CNET|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yes I Can also uses an alphanumeric association between numbers and letters.&lt;ref name=Boughton&amp;Durnan2014a/&gt;

The program consists of the following teaching materials: the student booklet, a facilitator manual and 17 videos or DVDs which present recordings of 65 classes with actors taking the parts of teachers and students. These materials are implemented by a team of local facilitators who are trained and supported by technical advisers. The process consists of three stages: a preliminary period of [[socialization]] and training, the actual lesson blocks in which literacy is taught and a third stage known as post-literacy.&lt;ref name=Boughton&amp;Durnan2014a/&gt;  The program is also available in [[braille]] for the blind, and for deaf people, and for people with mild intellectual problems.&lt;ref name="SpanishWiki"&gt;[[:es:Método de alfabetización "Yo|Método de alfabetización "Yo, sí puedo"]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=UNESCO|title=Education for All, Lieteracy for Life, 2006 EFA Global Monitoring Report|date=2005|publisher=UNESCO|location=Paris|page=29|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/reports/2006-literacy/|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs are linked to Yes I Can, including ''Yo, sí puedo seguir'' or Yes I Can Continue, which aims to consolidate and develop the basic literacy skills participants learn in the Yes I Can program.

== History ==

Yes I Can emerges from a strong tradition of literacy education that has existed in [[Cuba]] since the 1961 [[Cuban Literacy Campaign]].  The 1961 Campaign reduced the illiteracy rate in Cuba from 23.6%  to 3.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abendroth|first1=Mark|title=Rebel Literacy|date=2009|publisher=Litwin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time Cuban educators worked in many countries to help develop adult literacy prior to the development of Yes I Can, notably in [[Angola]] and Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hicking-Hudson, Corona Gonzalez &amp; Preston|editor1-first=A, J &amp; R|title=The Capacity to Share: A Study of Cuba's International Cooperation in Educational Development|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=13–34|chapter=The Cuban Revolution and Internationalism: Structuring Education and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C Hatsky|editor1-last=Hickling-Hudson, Corona Gonzalez &amp; Preston|editor1-first=A, J &amp; R|title=The Capacity to Share: A Study ofCuba's International Cooperation in Educational Development|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave &amp; Macmillan|location=New York|pages=141–160|chapter=Cuba's Educational Mission in Africa:The Example of Angola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was on the basis of such examples of Cuban educational aid that in 1995 the African country of [[Niger]] requested Cuban assistance to combat illiteracy.  Due to a very high illiteracy rate (over 50%) and the difficulties of addressing this entirely through face to face teaching Cuba proposed a program delivered by radio however the President of Niger [[Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara]] was killed in a [[1999 Nigerien coup d'état|coup d'état]] before the new approach could be implemented in Niger and it was instead trialled in Haiti and Nicaragua.  Following this Dr Leonela Relys Diaz and other educators at Latin American and Caribbean Pedagogical Institute (IPLAC) developed a similar program utilising TV.&lt;ref name=Boughton&amp;Durnan2014a/&gt;

== The lessons ==

Yes I Can classes are delivered using a combination of [[distance education]] and [[community]] participation.  The classes are convened by a local facilitator.  The classes are organized around a discussion topic, which introduces a key letter or word for the lesson. The facilitator uses a series of pre-recorded classes usually on DVD and the accompanying workbook as the basis of the literacy class. The DVD depicts a small literacy class in which the teacher explains the lesson and exercises in the workbook and the students ask questions and make comments.  The facilitator can stop and start the DVD-class, to allow their students to complete the exercises, discuss particular points, or repeat sections if required.&lt;ref name=Boughtonetal2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boughton, Chee, Beetson, Durnan &amp; LeBlanch|first1=B, D.A, J, D, J.C|title=An Aboriginal Adult Literacy Campaign Pilot Study in Australia using Yes I Can|journal=Literacy and Numeracy Studies|date=2013|volume=21|issue=1|pages=5–32|url=http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/lnj/article/view/3328|accessdate=30 January 2015|doi=10.5130/lns.v21i1.3328}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases economic and technical problems prevent the use of the DVD lessons which can cause inconsistencies in how the program is implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boon D &amp; Kurvers|first1=J|title=Ways of teaching reading and writing: Instructional practices in adult literacy classes in East Timor|date=2011|publisher=Low Educated Second Language and Literacy Acquisition Proceedings of the 7th Symposium|location=Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an introductory block of lessons designed for people with no prior experience of reading and writing which include exercises to practise holding a pen and forming simple shapes. In cases where participants already have some literacy experience these lessons can be skipped.  In later classes students work with more complex blocks of text and learn other skills such as how to fill out forms with basic personal data.  Students are considered to have successfully completed the program when they have produced a simple letter to a friend including description and opinion.&lt;ref name=Boughton&amp;Durnan2014a/&gt;

The local facilitator works as the link between the virtual class of students in the audiovisual recording and the real participants. A 2006 [[UNESCO]] review of Yes I Can notes, "The role of facilitators has received both recognition and criticism".&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Effectiveness and Feasibility of the Literacy Training Method ''Yo sí puedo''|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001468/146881e.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|date=25 August 2006|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report notes their strong social commitment, but notes problems in terms of the consistency of teaching skills amongst relatively untrained people.

== Alphanumeric method ==

The alphanumeric approach uses knowledge of numbers to develop a knowledge of letters. This was introduced to the program on the suggestion of Dr [[Fidel Castro]] and based on the understanding that numbers are more familiar in everyday life to people who are illiterate.  The vowels a, e, i, o, u are associated with the numbers 1-5 and the consonants are associated with numbers roughly in correspondence to their frequency of use.&lt;ref name=Boughton&amp;Durnan2014a/&gt;  Many illiterate people in Cuba were able to deal effectively with money and quantities, an education that they got on the streets. Linking literacy with numbers and money is one of the reasons it has been so successful. This aspect of the program has, however, been criticised on the grounds that the introduction of letters combined with numbers overwhelms the non-literate person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lind|first1=Agneta|title=Literacy for all: Making a difference|date=2008|publisher=UNESCO|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism failed to take account of the fact that many illiterate people are numerate with regards to money and tradeable quantities.

== Community wide approach ==

Within the Yes I Can method low literacy is not understood as an individual issue but rather as a [[social issue]] that requires a community wide approach. This process is referred to as socialization and involves mobilising as many people as possible to take part in the campaign in a variety of roles.  This process aims to develop a community wide understanding of the links between literacy and wider social and economic development goals.&lt;ref name=Boughtonetal2013/&gt;

In relation to this aspect of the campaign UNESCO has noted that Yes I Can, "is in fact more than a method. It would be more appropriate to understand it as a literacy training model that goes beyond processes, materials, strategies etc., as it includes, both explicitly and implicitly, concepts of literacy training, learning, [[life skills]] and [[mass mobilization|social mobilization]], and involves a wide range of actors with varied roles from the beneficiaries of the literacy training to other stakeholders such as state entities and other concerned institutions".&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

== Developing and maintaining literate communities ==

Yes I Can allows students to develop their reading and writing skills at an intelligent but basic level.&lt;ref name=SpanishWiki/&gt; However the program does not claim to establish a level of literacy that is self-sustaining without additional attention.&lt;ref name=Boughtonetal2013/&gt; Consequently, a third phase of the campaign, known as the 'post-literacy' phase (''Yo, sí puedo seguir'') provides opportunities for graduates to undertake activities that consolidate and extend their new literacy.  These may take the form of ongoing courses, employment or becoming a facilitator for a new intake of students.&lt;ref name=Boughton&amp;Durnan2014a/&gt;

== Achievements and prospects ==

In 2006 the [[UNESCO King Sejong Literacy Prize]] was awarded to IPLAC for its work in developing and promoting the Yes I Can program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Award of 2006 UNESCO Literacy Prizes|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35470&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|website=UNESCO portal|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it also received the "Mestres 68" Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Six Million People Learn to Read and Write with Cuban Method|url=http://en.cubadebate.cu/news/2012/11/22/about-six-million-people-learn-read-and-write-with-cuban-method/|website=Cuba Debate|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cuba has offered this method to the international community and has suggested that with its implementation illiteracy could be eradicated globally within 10 years and at a cost of just $1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canfux Gutiérrez,|first1=J.|last2=Corona González,|first2=J.|last3=Hickling-Hudson,|first3=A|editor1-last=Hickling-Hudson|editor1-first=A.|editor2-last=Corona González|editor2-first=J.|editor3-last=Preston|editor3-first=R.|title=The Capacity to Share: A Study of Cuba's International Cooperation in EducationalDevelopment|date=2012|location=New York|chapter=Cuban Cooperation in Literacy and Adult Education Overseas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yes I Can has been implemented in a number of linguistic and cultural contexts including the following:

=== Venezuela ===

In [[Venezuela]], Yes I Can was implemented as part of [[Mission Robinson]], a broader program of popular education initiated by the government of [[Hugo Chávez]]. Between 2003 and 2005 1.5 million Venezuelans completed the program and in 2005 Venezuela was declared an Illiteracy Free Territory.  The post-literacy phase was also strongly supported in Venezuela with Mission Robinson II providing access to primary education and Mission Robinson III providing access to reading circles across the country to allow the newly literate to consolidate and develop their skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Ewan|title=Venezuela’s Mission Robinson Literacy Program at 9 Years|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/7402|website=Venezuela Analysis|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East Timor ===

Yes I Can has been used in [[East Timor]] in a national campaign which began in 2006 with the arrival of 12 Cuban literacy advisors. By the end of 2007, literacy classes had commenced in over 400 local government areas of the country.  Although initially delivered in Portuguese, new materials were later designed in [[Tetum language|Tetum]], the most widely spoken of [[languages of East Timor|Timor's many languages]].  The program became known by its Tetum name, Los Hau Bele.  The campaign mobilised over 200,000 people to participate in classes, and a workforce of over 600 local literacy facilitators and community organizers, who were trained by the Cuban advisors. The campaign ended in December 2012, by which time every one of East Timor's thirteen districts had been declared free of illiteracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boughton B &amp; Durnan|first1=D|title=Cuba's "Yes, I Can" mass adult literacy campaign model in Timor-Leste and Aboriginal Australia: A comparative study|journal=International Review of Education|date=2014|volume=60|issue=4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11159-014-9421-5#page-1|doi=10.1007/s11159-014-9421-5|pages=559–580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===

In 2012 a formal licence agreement with Cuba enabled the first pilot project of Yes I Can to be initiated in [[Australia]].  The campaign was first implemented in [[Wilcannia]], in far-western [[New South Wales]] and has since expanded to [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]] and Enngonia with plans for further expansion in 2015.  The pilot was initiated by the National Aboriginal Adult Literacy Campaign Steering Committee and managed by the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] in partnership with Wilcannia Local Aboriginal Land Council.&lt;ref name=Boughtonetal2013/&gt;  The [[Literacy for Life Foundation]] is a partnership between key agencies and individuals involved in the campaign.

=== Aotearoa New Zealand ===

Yes I Can methodology was used in [[Aotearoa]], [[New Zealand]] in the Greenlight program implemented between 2003 and 2007 through the [[Māori people|Māori]]-led [[tertiary education|tertiary]] institution [[Te Wānanga o Aotearoa]].  Cuban educators worked with their counterparts in Aotearoa New Zealand in a diagnostic stage which resulted in the development of a new program, Greenlight Learning for Life.  Greenlight, consisted of 4 modules which were designed to take students from level 1 to level 3 on the NZ framework – essentially to university entrance standard. Traditional Maori pedagogy and identity were emphasised in the development of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canfux Gutiérrez|first1=J|title=Evaluation of the Social Impact of The Greenlight Learning for Life Programme.|date=n.d.|publisher=Pedagogical Institute for Latin America and the Caribbean|location=Havana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other locations ===

A version of Yes I Can has been implemented since 2007 in [[Uruguay]] and enjoyed widespread success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNESCO|title=En el país de Varela: Yo, sí puedo – Education Programme for Young People and Adults|url=http://www.unesco.org/uil/litbase/?menu=4&amp;programme=93|website=UNESCO Effective Literacy Programs|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, in [[Guatemala]] almost 20,000 people have learned to read and write using the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cuba Teaches Nearly 20,000 Guatemalans to Read|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Cuba-Teaches-Nearly-20000-Guatemalans-to-Read-20140828-0039.html|website=Telesur|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Angola over 300 000 people have benefited from the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over 300,000 Angolans Benefited from Cuban Literacy Method|url=https://youthandeldersja.wordpress.com/2013/10/02/over-300000-angolans-benefited-from-cuban-literacy-method/|website=Jamaicans in Solidarity with Cuba|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yes I Can is also being implemented in the city of [[Seville]] which is the first experience with the Cuban method in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yo sí puedo Sevilla (Parte 1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1uzfIvrkLU|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latino Alliance for Literacy Advancement de New Mexico plans to implement the Yes I Can campaign in 4 pilot sites in the US state of [[New Mexico]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yo Sí Puedo|url=https://thelalagroup.wordpress.com/yo-si-puedo-program/|website=Latino Alliance for Literacy Advancement de New Mexico|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
