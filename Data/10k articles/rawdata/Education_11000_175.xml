The '''2017 Science Olympiad National Tournament''' was the 33rd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soinc.org/history|title=History - Science Olympiad|website=www.soinc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; annual edition of the National [[Science Olympiad]] tournament, a competition in which 120 teams (sixty middle school and sixty high school) from all fifty states compete in twenty three [[science]]-related events, in various fields of science, such as [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology]], and [[geology]]. The tournament was hosted for a second time by [[Wright State University]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], with competitions being held around campus and the opening and closing ceremonies being held at the [[Nutter Center]].

Only one of the winners from [[2016 Science Olympiad National Tournament|last year's national competition]] at the [[University of Wisconsin, Stout]] were able to defend their titles; the defending champions were Daniel Wright Junior High School ([[Illinois|IL]]) and Mira Loma H.S. ([[California|CA]]). Daniel Wright finished first to successfully defend their title, and Mira Loma finished fifth. Troy High School ([[California|CA]]) won the Division C tournament to win their eleventh title, extending their record as the team with the most National Championships.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wright.edu/sites/www.wright.edu/files/page/attachments/SONT17-Final-Combined-Results.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Mothercraft Society''' (Mothercraft) is a non-profit, charitable [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] that serves children ages 0 to 6, their families, their teachers, and their community.

== History ==
Mothercraft's history dates back to 1907 when Dr. [[Truby King]] introduced "Mothercraft as an Educational Process" as an intervention strategy in [[New Zealand]] for the high rate of [[infant mortality]].  Dr. King's "Twelve Essentials" (King, 1930) for the raising of healthy infants included:air and sunshine, water, food, clothing, bathing, muscular exercise and [http://www.smarttotapps.com/smart-tot-rattle/ sensory stimulation], warmth, regularity, cleanliness, mothering, management, and rest and sleep.  Dr. King's "Twelve Essentials" were thought to be revolutionary at the time.

In 1918, Dr. King campaigned on the need for the pre-parenting for parenting and the value of breast-feeding.  Dr. King was invited to establish a system of Mothercraft.  The underlying message of his program and of the Mothercraft manual was: "Build healthy babies rather than patch sick ones".  The Mothercraft system became known as the Mothercraft Movement as it spread to all corners of the British empire, including Australia, England, India, Jamaica, New Zealand, Scotland, and South Africa.

In 1925, His Majesty [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] knighted Dr. King.  Over the years, the [[Royal Family]] provided support, interest, and encouragement in the activities and accomplishments of Mothercraft.

In 1931, Barbara Mackenzie, a registered nurse and midwife trained in New Zealand came to Canada and married Irving Robertson, then Chairman of the Board of the [[Hospital for Sick Children]] in Toronto, Canada.  Together, Mr. and Mrs. Robertson established the Canadian Mothercraft Society.  Mrs. Robertson championed the cause of mid-wifery, founded the Mothercraft Well-Baby Nursing Training program, and operated the Mothercraft maternity hospital, and maintained a community registry of Well-Baby Nurses.  Well-Baby Nurses aided with breastfeeding, getting infants on schedules, and provided at home child care support. The registry of Well-Baby Nurses was maintained until 1990.

The work of the Canadian Mothercraft Societyalso attracted the attention of Britain's [[Royal Family]]. In 1931, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York, became the Honorary Patroness of the Canadian Mothercraft Society.

In these early days, the Canadian Mothercraft Society supported infants awaiting adoption with the Catholic Children's Aid Society and provided hospice for infants who were very ill. It was also a time prior to the establishment of Canadian public health systems.  To support local efforts at community-based public health, Mothercraft opened advice rooms so that families could bring young children for medical and nutritional advice.  Mothercraft also pioneered prenatal classes that focused on infant well-being and mental health.

In the 1960s, Mothercraft's medical focus broadened to include early learning and care and, in 1965, the Canadian Mothercraft Society opened one of the first infant child care centres in Toronto, positioning Mothercraft as a leader in infant care and education... a specialization that holds true in 2007.

In 1967, Mothercraft joined with the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] and conducted research with Dr. William Fowler to determine the effects of quality child care on disadvantaged children.  The findings from Dr. Fowler's research provided the foundation for Mothercraft's curriculum in [[Early Childhood Education]]. To learn more about the work of Dr. Fowler and Mothercraft, link to the media clip of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) found in External Links.  In 1979, Mothercraft again joined research forces with the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] studying early intervention strategies for infant at risk and their families with Dr. Dorothy Shipe. The findings from this research provided a foundation for Mothercraft's early intervention programs.

== Activities ==

In 2011, The Canadian Mothercraft Society departments include:

*'''Mothercraft College''', home to Mothercraft's diploma program in [[Early Childhood Education]] and Research and Evaluation

'''Chilocco Indian School''' was an [[agriculture|agricultural]] school for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on reserved land in north-central [[Oklahoma]] from 1884 to 1980.  It was approximately 20 miles north of [[Ponca City, Oklahoma]] and seven miles north of [[Newkirk, Oklahoma]], near the [[Kansas]] border. The name "Chilocco" is apparently derived from a [[Muscogee language|Muscogee]] word meaning "big deer" or horse.&lt;ref&gt;Bright, William. ''Native American Placenames of the United States'' Norman: U of OK Press, 2004, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 the [[Oklahoma Supreme Court]] heard a case over an election dispute involving whisky and whether the Chilocco reservation was part of Kay County and Oklahoma or "Indian Territory".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=eyBNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA447&amp;dq=chiloco+reservation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVxciMiKLeAhXC6lMKHXs8DZ44ChDoAQgpMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chiloco%20reservation&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that school land was not an Indian Reservation, that the school was an off-reservation entity, and that the word reservation had various meanings and the area was not reserved as Indian territory.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=fR0tAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=chiloco+reservation&amp;dq=chiloco+reservation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVxciMiKLeAhXC6lMKHXs8DZ44ChDoAQhQMAc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The U.S. Congress in 1882 authorized the creation of five non-[[Indian reservation|reservation]] [[boarding school]]s.  Chilocco was one of the five which also included [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Haskell Indian Nations University]] in Kansas, [[Chemawa Indian School]] in [[Oregon]], and [[Fort Simcoe]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Major [[James M. Haworth]], first Superintendent of Indian Schools, selected a site for the school along Chilocco Creek and the school was established according to an executive order signed by president [[James Garfield]].&lt;ref&gt;https://catalog.archives.gov/id/10452421&lt;/ref&gt;  Chilocco was located in the [[Cherokee Outlet]] or Cherokee Strip and the [[Cherokee]] provided 8,640 acres (35 km2) of land to help Chilocco fulfill its mandate for agricultural education.

==Objective and curriculum==

Chilocco provided academic and [[vocational education]] to American Indian students from all tribes in the United States. The objective of the school was to integrate and assimilate American Indians into the mainstream of American life. Until the 1930s, the school relied on a highly structured and strict military regime. 

Students "remember twenty-two bugle calls a day, Government-issue uniforms, scanty meals, inadequate health care, and a paucity of individual attention." The school was "home and haven to some, reformatory and prison to others." Instruction focused mostly on vocational training rather than academic subjects and students were required to perform manual and domestic labor known as "actual work."&lt;ref name="digital.library.okstate.edu"&gt;Lomawaima, K. Tsianina. [http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=CH042 "Chilocco Indian Agricultural School,"] ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture'', Oklahoma Historical Society, accessed August 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Students were required to attend Christian religious services once a week.&lt;ref&gt;"Chilocco Indian School REVISITED." http://www.abandonedok.com/chilocco-indian-scool-revisited/, accessed 20 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garden Photo, Miss Robertson, 1909 - NARA - 251746.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A few dozen students work with gardening tools in a leafy field|Students working in the garden at Chilocco Indian School]]

A 1928 report critical of the Indian boarding schools led to reforms in the 1930s. "Boys and girls could sit together in the dining rooms, more attention was invested in academic work, and drudgery work devoted to school upkeep was cut back."&lt;ref name="digital.library.okstate.edu"/&gt; The curriculum at the school focused on agricultural trades, including horseshoeing and blacksmithing, but also included building trades, printing, shoe repair, tailoring, leather work, and in later years plumbing, electrical work, welding, auto mechanics, food services and office education.

==History==
The school opened in 1884 with 150 students from the [[Cheyenne]], [[Arapaho]], [[Wichita people|Wichita]], [[Comanche]], and [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] tribes.&lt;ref name="digital.library.okstate.edu"/&gt;  In 1894 the first graduating class consisted of 15 students. As the school expanded, additional structures were added in 1893, 1899, 1903, 1909, 1923, 1931 and 1932. In the 1960s, several of the older buildings were demolished to make room for a new dormitory and machine shop.  The school's facilities at one time included more than 100 buildings, including a dining hall and hospital. Buildings were constructed from distinctive locally quarried yellow limestone.  Students worked on the "rockpile" breaking large boulders into construction material.&lt;ref name="abandonedok.com"&gt;"Chilocco Indian School REVISITED" http://www.abandonedok.com/chilocco-indian-school-revisited/, accessed 20 Sept 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NEPE Rifle Chief Joseph.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chief Joseph]] gave his hunting rifle to Chilocco in 1885.  It was returned to the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Percé]] when the school was closed in 1980.]]
Enrollment declined during the 1920s and the elementary school was closed, but with the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 enrollment increased because of growing poverty among Indians.  As one graduate said, "It wasn't a matter of enjoying [Chilocco], it meant we were educated, clothed, fed, and had a roof over our head."&lt;ref&gt;Brumley, Kim. ''Chilocco: Memories of a Native American Boarding School.'' Fairfax, OK: Guardian Publishing, 2010, p 53&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 a special program for Navajo youth began.  Enrollment at Chilocco peaked at about 1,300 in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservationok.org/2011_Chilocco_Indian_School.html, accessed 20 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, enrollment declined as many Indians had access to public schools and a boarding school was no longer essential to their education.  In the 1970s, activists from American [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] organizations criticized abuses and, in 1972, the National Indian Youth Council staged a sit-in at the school.  By the late 1970s only about 100 students still lived at the school.&lt;ref name="abandonedok.com"/&gt;

==After closure==
The Chilocco School closed in June 1980 when the U.S. Congress ceased funding. In the school's 1980 yearbook, Superintendent C. C. Tillman wrote, "Chilocco is another in a long list of broken promises."  During its history nearly 18,000 students from 126 Indian tribes attended Chilocco.&lt;ref&gt;Brumley, Kim.  ''Chilocco: Memories of a Native American Boarding School.'' Fairfax, OK: Guardian Publishing Co., 2010, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Chilocco granted high school diplomas to 5,542 students.  Graduates included 688 Cherokee, 573 Choctaw, 545 [[Navajo people|Navajo]], and 452 Creek divided between 2,741 females and 2,801 males.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chilocco.org/History/Timeline.aspx, accessed 20 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

After closure, the school's land was granted to five local tribes as the Chilocco Development Authority; the [[Kaw Nation]] (.10 mineral interest), the [[Otoe-Missouria Tribe]] (.10 mineral interest), the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee Nation]] (.10 mineral interest), the [[Ponca Nation]] (.10 mineral interest), and the [[Tonkawa|Tonkawa Tribe]] (.10 mineral interest). The [[Cherokee Nation]] holds a .50 mineral interest. Between 1989 and 2001, the property was leased to [[Narconon]], which operated a substance abuse rehabilitation center at the site. In 2011, Chilocco was closed to the public and used as a training and practice facility for [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement]] personnel.&lt;ref name="abandonedok.com"/&gt;
{{Clear}}
In October 2016, the Cherokees announced that they were leasing to [[PNE Wind]] more than 4,000 acres of Chilocco land for a wind energy project.&lt;ref&gt;"Tribal Council approves lease for wind farm at former Chilocco Indian School,"http://www.cherokee.org/News/Stories/20161019-Tribal-Council-approves-lease-for-wind-farm-at-former-Chilocco-Indian-School, accessed 10 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, The Department of Homeland Security released a statement warning the residents they are preparing in the event of a biological attack. According to a 58-page document, chemicals will be released at Chilocco Indian School in Newkirk. 
&lt;ref&gt;"The Department of Homeland Security Environmental Assessment of Proposed Tracer Particle and Biological Releases for the Hazards of Dynamic Outdoor Release (HODOR) Project,"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DHS%20HODOR%20Enviromental%20Assessment%2010%2025%202017-508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In January/February and again in June/July 2018, particles will be released onto buildings of the Chilocco campus. It is to determine how well biological agents will penetrate into single and multi-family homes. The department claims these chemicals are nontoxic and nonhazardous; however, personnel will wear suits, masks, gloves and respirators when in the zone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newson6.com/story/36817786/chemicals-to-be-released-near-newkirk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
{{empty section|date=September 2013}}

==Career==
In the late 1970s, he joined [[post-punk]] band [[The Durutti Column]] as singer during the last months of 1978, replacing original vocalist [[Phil Rainford]]. The band featured [[Vini Reilly]] and [[Dave Rowbotham]] as guitarists and future [[Simply Red]] members [[Tony Bowers]] on bass and [[Chris Joyce]] on drums. With him, the band continued to play live performances and recorded two songs, "No Communication" and "Thin Ice (Detail)", for the ''[[A Factory Sample]]'' EP (a various artist compilation which featured also other artists from [[Factory Records]] (label who signed the band): [[Joy Division]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[John Dowie (humourist)|John Dowie]]). Shortly afterwards, only Reilly remained in the band. 

In 1978, by the time he joined and left The Durutti Column, he formed a [[glam punk|glam-punk]] band, The Roaring 80s, who were active until their split in 1981, opening shows for [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], [[Joy Division]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundunwound.com/sp/contributor/view/The-Roaring-80s?contributorId=15855856&amp;ref=DI |title=The Roaring 80s - Discography, biography, music, MP3s, members, pictures &amp; videos at SoundUnwound |publisher=Soundunwound.com |date= |accessdate= 2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, he founded, in Newcastle, the rock band SF Jive, which lasted until 1990; he was the band's vocalist and percussionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundunwound.com/sp/contributor/view/SF-Jive?contributorId=15856921&amp;ref=GP |title=SF Jive - Discography, biography, music, MP3s, members, pictures &amp; videos at SoundUnwound |publisher=Soundunwound.com |date= |accessdate= 2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he formed an experimental music trio called Glow, but they were active only one year.&lt;ref name="soundunwound.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundunwound.com/sp/contributor/view/Glow?contributorId=15856862&amp;ref=GP |title=Glow - Discography, biography, music, MP3s, members, pictures &amp; videos at SoundUnwound |publisher=Soundunwound.com |date= |accessdate= 2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he reappeared in the post-punk scene, when his collaboration with American band [[Vernian Process]] was released within the band's second album ''The Forgotten Age''.  It included the song "Where Are The Young Men?", which Sharp composed in memory of his late friends who were part of the [[new wave music]] scene, including [[Ian Curtis]], [[Martin Hannett]], [[Billy Mackenzie]], [[Adrian Borland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girlsandcorpses.com/issue10_vernian.html |title=Girls &amp; Corpses |publisher=Girlsandcorpses.com |date= |accessdate= 2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vernianprocess.com/http%3A/%252Fwww.vernianprocess.com/discography].

In 2007, he published his book ''Who Killed Martin Hannett?{{spaced ndash}} The History of Factory Records' Musical Magician'', a biography of his close friend, the producer [[Martin Hannett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Staff|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/07/10/100707_hannett_sharp_feature.shtml |title= Zeroing in on Martin |publisher= [[BBC Manchester]] |date= 21 December 2007 |accessdate= 2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He taught drama at [[Tyne Metropolitan College]] until July 2008.{{clarify|date=September 2013|reason=starting when? also his imdb profile has "Became the first Creative Director of Tyneside's Tom Hadaway Theatre."  if can be better sourced, should be included}}

'''David Jeffrey Griffiths''' (born 1942) is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[physics|physicist]] and educator.  He worked at [[Reed College]] from 1978 through 2009, becoming the [[Howard Vollum]] Professor of Science before his retirement.  He is not to be confused with the late physicist David J. Griffiths of [[Oregon State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Landau, Rubin H.|title=In Memoriam: David John Griffiths|newspaper=Oregon State U. Physics Newsletter|volume=1|issue=1|date=Jan 2007|page=2|url=http://physics.oregonstate.edu/files/physics/PhysicNews12-06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Griffiths is a graduate of [[The Putney School]] and was trained at [[Harvard University]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], 1964; [[Master's degree|M.A.]], 1966; [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], 1970).  His doctoral work ("[[Covariance|Covariant]] Approach to Massless Field Theory in the Radiation Gauge") on theoretical [[particle physics]] was supervised by [[Sidney Coleman]].  He is principally known as the author of three highly regarded textbooks for [[undergraduate]] physics students:  ''Introduction to Elementary Particles'' (published in 1987, second edition published 2008), ''Introduction to Quantum Mechanics'' (published in 1995, third edition published 2018), and ''Introduction to Electrodynamics'' (published in 1981, fourth edition published in 2012). He was also the recipient of the 1997 [[Robert A. Millikan award]] reserved for "those who have made outstanding scholarly contributions to physics education".&lt;ref name=Griffiths1997&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffiths |first=David |authorlink=David Griffiths (physicist) |date=December 1997 |title=Millikan Lecture 1997: Is there a text in this class? |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=65 |issue=12 |pages=1141–1143 |url=http://scitation.aip.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=AJPIAS&amp;CURRENT=NO&amp;ONLINE=YES&amp;smode=strresults&amp;sort=rel&amp;maxdisp=25&amp;threshold=0&amp;pjournals=AJPIAS&amp;pyears=2001%2C2000%2C1999&amp;possible1=1141&amp;possible1zone=fpage&amp;fromvolume=65&amp;SMODE=strsearch&amp;OUTLOG=NO&amp;viewabs=AJPIAS&amp;key=DISPLAY&amp;docID=1&amp;page=1&amp;chapter=0 |accessdate=2007-05-22 |doi=10.1119/1.18777 |bibcode=1997AmJPh..65.1141G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/Programs/awards/millikan.cfm List of Robert A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4220">A '''Diploma of Journalism''' (or '''Diploma in Journalism''') is an [[Academic degree|academic qualification]] in [[journalism]] issued by a university or college.

The diploma is generally issued after one year of study. As is common with [[diploma]]s in general, diplomas in journalism are often more practical or applied than a course leading to a [[bachelor's]] or [[master's degree]] in journalism. Some universities offer [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] Diplomas of Journalism.

Historically, the emergence of journalism diplomas reflected the somewhat condescending view of journalism education which emerged in Britain and British Commonwealth countries, unlike the United States. Briggs and Burke point out that, despite the emergence of university degree programs in the United States from the late 19th century, British universities were uninterested in formal [[journalism education]], and entered the field only at sub-degree level: "between 1919 and 1939 the only University Diploma for Journalism in Britain was offered at London University".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs &amp; Burke, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s in Australia, four universities started journalism diploma courses as sub-degree programs, but none of the courses survived in this form. (They have since emerged as degree courses.)&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, there has been debate about comparisons between diploma and degree programs in journalism, with advocates of diplomas arguing that the shorter courses, with their lesser emphasis on theory, are often more relevant to industry needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamecareerguide.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1354] [http://www.studyconnect.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4443]&lt;/ref&gt; Degree courses, however, offer deeper theoretical exposure and greater analysis of ethical and legal issues.

In New Zealand, the media industry has developed a national diploma of journalism, establishing a curriculum which is followed by accredited training institutions, including universities and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalismtraining.co.nz/schools.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Britain National Council for the Training of Journalists offers certificate courses and accredits colleges and universities offering diplomas and degrees in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nctj.com/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another development has been the specialist diploma in a particular field of journalism, such as sports journalism, science journalism or business journalism, generally taught at postgraduate level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nml.ru.ac.za/blog/reg-rumney/2008/09/02/what-keynes-can-teach-editors-about-journalism-education.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

English-language institutions offering the Diploma of Journalism are mainly in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.

== Research==

Eric Bettinger's current research interests include the [[economics of education]], [[educational policy]], [[higher education]], and [[comparative education]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/ebetting Profile of Eric Bettinger on the website of the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Retrieved March 28th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[IDEAS/RePEc]], Bettinger belongs to the 5% of most highly cited economists worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html#pbe413 Ranking of economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc. Retrieved March 28th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Key findings of his research include:

=== Impact evaluations of educational interventions in primary and secondary school===

* Financially rewarding elementary school students for test completion effectively improved test scores in math but not in reading, social science or science.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v94y2012i3p686-698.html Bettinger, E.P. (2012). Paying to Learn: The Effect of Financial Incentives on Elementary School Test Scores. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 94(3), pp. 686-698.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The winners of vouchers for partial coverage of private secondary school tuition in [[Colombia]] were ca. 10% more likely to have finished 8th grade and scored 0.2 standard deviations higher on achievement tests three years later, and raised secondary school completion rates in the long-term by 15-20%, with the benefits to participants likely exceeding the $24 of additional cost to the government of supplying vouchers instead of public school places (with [[Joshua Angrist]], [[Erik Bloom]], Elizabeth King, and [[Michael Kremer]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v92y2002i5p1535-1558.html Angrist, J. et al. (2002). Vouchers for Private Schooling in Colombia: Evidence from a Randomized Natural Experiment. ''American Economic Review'', 92(5), pp. 1535-1558.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v96y2006i3p847-862.html Angrist, J., Bettinger, E., Kremer, M. (2006). Long-Term Educational Consequences of Secondary School Vouchers: Evidence from Administrative Records in Colombia. ''American Economic Review'', 96(3), pp. 847-862.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Test scores of charter school students don't improve, and may actually decline, relative to those of public school students, suggesting that charter schools have had little or no effect on test scores in neighbouring public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecoedu/v24y2005i2p133-147.html Bettinger, E.P. (2005). The effect of charter schools on charter students and public schools. ''Economics of Education Review'', 24(2), pp. 133-147.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact evaluations of educational interventions in higher education===

* Students in remediation are more likely to persist in college compared to students with similar backgrounds who were not required to take remedial courses (with [[Bridget Terry Long]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/uwp/jhriss/v44y2009i3p736-771.html Bettinger, E.P., Long, B.T. (2009). Addressing the Needs of Underprepared Students in Higher Education: Does College Remediation Work? ''Journal of Human Resources'', 44(3), pp. 736-771.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Providing low-income individuals assistance with applying for student aid and/or information comparing student aid with college tuition costs results in increased college attendance, persistence, and aid receipt, suggesting a broad spectrum of applications for personal assistance (with Long, [[Philip Oreopoulos]] and Lisa Sanbonmatsu).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v127y2012i3p1205-1242.html Bettinger, E.P. et al. (2012). The Role of Application Assistance and Information in College Decisions: Results from H&amp;R Block Fafsa Experiment. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 127(3), pp. 1205-1242.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pell Grant]]s are found to reduce college drop-out and suggest a relationship between need-based aid and college completion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/h/nbr/nberch/10101.html Bettinger, E. (2004). How Financial Aid Affects Persistence. In: Hoxby, C.M. (ed.). ''College Choices: The Economics of Where to Go, When to Go, and How to Pay For It. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 207-237.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Female teachers positively influence female students' selection of courses and choice of major in some disciplines, which is coherent with a role model effect, though no such effect is found in male-dominated fields (with Long).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v95y2005i2p152-157.html Bettinger, E.P., Long, B.T. (2005). Do Faculty Serve as Role Models? The Impact of Instructor Gender on Female Students. ''AEA Papers &amp; Proceedings'', 95(2), pp. 152-157.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adjuncts appear to have a small, positive effect on student enrollment patterns in higher education, in particular in fields related to specific occupations (with Long).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v92y2010i3p598-613.html Bettinger, E.P., Long, B.T. (2010). Does Cheaper Mean Better? The Impact of Using Adjunct Instructors on Student Outcomes. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 92(3), pp. 598-613.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Student coaching effectively increases college persistence, even one year after coaching ended, and proved cost effective compared to e.g. increased financial aid for students (with Rachel Baker).&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0162373713500523 Bettinger, E., Baker, R. (2011). The Effects of Student Coaching in College: An Evaluation of a Randomized Experiment in Student Mentoring. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'', 36(1), pp. 3-19.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8656">The '''Free Software Directory''' ('''FSD''') is a project of the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF).  It catalogs [[free software]] that runs under free [[operating system]]s - particularly [[GNU operating system|GNU]] and [[Linux]]. The cataloged projects are often able to run in several other operating systems. The project was formerly co-run by [[UNESCO]].

Unlike some other directories that focus on free software,&lt;ref&gt;Among public directories that focus on free software, for example, Kim, E. E. (2003). [http://www.blueoxen.org/research/00007/ An Introduction to Open Source Communities] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030602194529/http://www.blueoxen.org/research/00007/ |date=2003-06-02 }} mentions [[SourceForge]] and [[Freshmeat]]:
{{quote|There are three major databases of open source software available on the Internet today: the GNU Free Software Directory (https://www.gnu.org/directory/), [[SourceForge]] (http://sourceforge.net/), and [[Freshmeat]] (http://freshmeat.net/).}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Free Software Directory staff verify the licenses of software listed in the directory.

==Coverage growth and usages==
FSD has been used as a source for assessing the share of free software, for example finding in September 2002 an amount of "1550 entries, of which 1363 (87.9%) used the GPL license, 103 (6.6%) used the LGPL license, 32 (2.0%) used a BSD or BSD-like license, 29 (1.9%) used the Artistic license, 5 (0.3%) used the MIT license".&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler D. A. (2011). [http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else.]. Released 2002-05-06, revised 2011-04-26. The article remarked that: {{quote|The FSF prefers the GPL license, so the FSF directory statistic may be biased in the percentage of GPLed software it registers, but the directory still provides strong additional evidence that the GPL is a widely used license for [[FLOSS]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2009, the Directory listed 6,000 packages whose number grew up to 6,500 in October 2011, when the newly updated directory was launched. All listed packages are "free for any computer user to download, run and share. Each entry is individually checked and tested [...] so users know that any program they come across in the directory will be truly free software [...] with free documentation and without proprietary software requirements".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Noyes | first1 = K. | title = Looking for Free Software? A New Directory Can Help | series = PCWorld | year = 2011 | url= https://www.pcworld.com/article/240859/looking_for_free_software_a_new_directory_can_help.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scientific publications review or refer to the directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reichle |first1=M. |last2=Hanft | first2=A. |year=2006 |title=Strategies and Technologies of Sharing in Contributor-Run Archives |journal=Library Trends |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=651–662 |arxiv= | url=http://hdl.handle.net/2142/1750 | agency=handle.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Dorn | first1 = J. | last2 = Hochmeister | first2 = M. | title = TechScreen: Mining Competencies in Social Software | series = The 13th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics | place = Orlando | pages = 115–126 | year = 2009 | url= http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/node/13747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Amatriain | first1 = X. | last2 = Griffiths | first2 = D. | title = Free Software in Education: Is it a Viable Alternative? | series = Proceedings of the 7th IMAC Conference on Localization and Globalization in Technology | place = Duisburg, Germany | year = 2004 | url= http://mtg.upf.edu/node/369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been remarked that the Directory "only includes software that runs on free operating systems. The FSF/UNESCO Free Software Directory is also a collaborative project, offering a web interface for users to enter and update entries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=P. |year=2005 |title=The FLOSSWALD Information System on Free and Open Source Software |journal=Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Learning Software Organizations }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the critical issues of the previous version, it has been pointed out that while "available software is described using a variety of textual metadata, including the components upon which a particular piece of software depends", "unfortunately, those dependencies are only listed by name, and locating and retrieving them is left to the user".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van der Hoek |first1=A. |last2=Wolf |first2=A. L. |year=2002 |title=Software release management for component-based software |journal=Software — Practice and Experience |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=77–98 |arxiv= |doi=10.1002/spe.496 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.13.3314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, the accuracy of the directory review on licenses is acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | quote=The Free Software Foundation's "Free Software Directory" is somewhat smaller, but they work hard to make sure their information is accurate (in particular, they check licenses carefully).|last=

In September 2011, the Free Software Directory was re-implemented as a [[wiki]], using [[MediaWiki]] and the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension, to allow users to directly add to and modify its contents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsf.org/news/directory-relaunch Free Software Foundation re-launches its Free Software Directory, with over 6500 programs listed] (press release), Josh Gay, September 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Semantic MediaWiki provides the directory with [[semantic web]] technologies by adding "advanced search and presentation capabilities, structured to be useful for reading by both humans and data-mining programs".&lt;ref  name="teck_in"&gt;[http://teck.in/the-free-software-foundation-fsf-re-launches-free-software-directory.html The Free Software Foundation (FSF) Re-launches Free Software Directory], TECK.IN, October 3rd, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new edition of the directory has been described as designed to ease and support with [[semantics]] the discovery and harvesting of information on free software programs. "An extensive and flexible category system, plus over 40,000 keywords and more than 40 different fields of information, enhance both simple and advanced searching".&lt;ref name="teck_in" /&gt;

A recent snapshot of the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of the projects reviewed and accepted in the directory is the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Category/All Last visited: 2017 January 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henri Victor Gabriel Le Fauconnier''' (July 5, 1881 – December 25, 1946) was a French [[Cubism|Cubist]] painter born in [[Hesdin]]. Le Fauconnier was seen as one of the leading figures among the Montparnasse Cubists. At the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]] Le Fauconnier and colleagues [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Robert Delaunay]] caused a scandal with their Cubist paintings. He was in contacts with many European avant-garde artists such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]], writing a theoretical text for the catalogue of the [[Neue Künstlervereinigung München|Neue Künstlervereinigung]] in Munich, of which he became a member. His paintings were exhibited in Moscow reproduced as examples of the latest art in ''[[Der Blaue Reiter|Der Blaue Reiter Almanach]]'' (''The Blue Rider Almanac'').&lt;ref name="Hermitage"&gt;[http://www.hermitage.nl/en/tentoonstellingen/matisse_tot_malevich/biografieen/henri_le_fauconnier.htm Hermitage Amsterdam, Artist biographies, Henri Le Fauconnier]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h.jpg|thumb|''Ploumanac’h'', 1908, Bergen, Museum Kranenburgh]]
In 1901 Henri Le Fauconnier moved from northern France to Paris, where he studied law, then attended painting classes in the studio of [[Jean-Paul Laurens]], then in the [[Academie Julian]].&lt;ref name="Hermitage" /&gt; He changed his from Fauconnier to ''Le'' Fauconnier and exhibited at the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] in 1904 and 1905, implementing bold colors in line with [[Henri Matisse]]. He moved to [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] in 1907 and painted the rocky landscapes of Ploumanac'h in a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] style characterized by chastened tones of brown and greens with thick outlines delimiting the simplified forms.

[[File:Henri Le Fauconnier, 1910-11, L'Abondance (Abundance), oil on canvas, 191 x 123 cm (75.25 x 48.5 in.), Gemeentemuseum Den Haag.jpeg|thumb|left|''L'Abondance (Abundance)'', 1910-11, oil on canvas, 191 x 123 cm (75.25 x 48.5 in.), [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag]]]]
He explored a personal style and put it into practice; painting nudes or portraits (such as that of the poet [[Pierre Jean Jouve]] in 1909 ([[Musée National d'Art Moderne]]). Under the influence of [[Paul Cézanne]] he developed his own form of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Hermitage" /&gt; Back in Paris, he mingles with the artistic and literary gathered around [[Paul Fort]] at the Closerie des Lilas in [[Montparnasse]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IE16991FHJwC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Henri+le+Fauconnier,+1908,+Ploumanac'h+x+cm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BNXl-rzHkI&amp;sig=fbpXaQnYXmvVeuuQq7T5mt59RWk&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Guillaume Apollinaire, Dorothea Eimert, Anatoli Podoksik, Cubism].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1909 Salon d’Automne Le Fauconnier exhibited alongside [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Fernand Léger]].

[[Louis Vauxcelles]], in his review of the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], made a passing and inaccurate reference to Le Fauconnier, Jean Metzinger, [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Fernand Léger]], as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger had written in 1910 of 'mobile perspective' as an interpretation of what would soon become known as "Cubism" with respect to Picasso, Braque, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, Note sur la peinture, Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

At the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Le Fauconnier published a theoretical text in the catalog of the Neue Künstlervereinigung (Munich, 1910). He opened his Rue Visconti studio in Paris to artists eager like him to apply the lessons of Cézanne. With Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay, he contributed to the Cubist scandal of the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. Le Fauconnier exhibited his vast ''Les Montagnards attaqués par des ours'' (''Mountaineers Attacked by Bears'') at the Salon d'Automne of 1912 (Paris).&lt;ref&gt;David Cottington, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Henri+Le+Fauconnier,+Montagnards+attaqués+par+des+ours&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wOVwobbO8Z&amp;sig=rBFgeIDuzt9GrEjkQCv7vFWqpMc&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914], pp. 104-107&lt;/ref&gt;

February 1912 Henri Le Fauconnier was appointed to succeed [[Jacques-Émile Blanche]] as ''chef d'atelier'' of the [[avant-garde]] school of art [[Académie de La Palette]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x-DqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=palette#search_anchor John Golding, ''Cubism: A History and an Analysis, 1907-1914'', Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; Le Fauconnier commissioned [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]] as full-time instructors for the morning sessions; [[Eugeniusz Żak]] (Eugène Zak) and [[:fr:Jean Francis Auburtin|Jean Francis Auburtin]] took over in the afternoon.&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt237.html Academies in Paris, Kubisme.info (Dutch)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203010147/http://www.kubisme.info/kt237.html |date=2015-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Le Fauconnier participated in the first exhibition of Cubism in Spain, at [[Galeries Dalmau]], Barcelona, with [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Marie Laurencin]], and August Agero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicacions.ub.edu/ficha.aspx?cod=03809 Mercè Vidal, ''L'exposició d'Art Cubista de les Galeries Dalmau 1912''], Edicions Universitat Barcelona, 1996, {{ISBN|8447513831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pàmies"&gt;[https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/22029/Andres_13.pdf?sequence=1 Elisenda Andrés Pàmies, ''Les Galeries Dalmau, un projecte de modernitat a la ciutat de Barcelona''], 2012-13, Facultat d’Humanitats, Universitat Pompeu Fabra&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson et al"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=6EvIx6zOuqgC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=%22August+Agero%22+%22galeries+dalmau%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=egrZl065OV&amp;sig=Jzul0X2w7oi0sxSnSlNlFxlUC4E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYobvKrcPaAhWIxxQKHefzBLMQ6AEIajAN#v=onepage&amp;q=dalmau&amp;f=false William H.

Le Fauconnier was a contributing member of the [[Section d'Or]] (Puteaux Group).

At the outset of [[World War I]] Le Fauconnier moved to the Netherlands where he stayed for six years. His work at this time combined Cubism and [[Expressionism]], which generated considerable success and influence in the Netherlands. He returned to France in 1920 where his paintings became more realistic.&lt;ref name="Hermitage" /&gt;

He died of a heart attack in [[Paris]] (1946).

'''Hermann Lux''' (3 September 1904 in [[Karlsruhe]] – 8 July 1999), was a prominent inorganic [[chemist]] from [[Munich]], Germany.

Lux studied chemistry in the [[University of Karlsruhe]] where he graduated with honors in 1928 and then completed his education in the University of Bonn in 1929. He returned to Karlsruhe and worked there until his move to [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] in 1937, where he worked as an assistant until 1940, then as a lecturer until 1946 and then became the head of the analytical chemistry department.
He became an associate professor in 1944 and a full professor in 1955. He moved to the [[Technical University of Munich]] in 1968 where he was a full professor of [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] and [[Analytical chemistry|analytical]] chemistry until his retirement in 1973. He died on 8 July 1999, almost 95 years old.

== Achievements ==
* Discovered a method of quantitative determination of 1 ppm quantities of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (1931, together with Alfred Stock)
* Extensively studied chemical reactions in molten salts, leading up to the [[Acid-base reaction theories#Lux–Flood definition|Lux-Flood acid-base theory]] (1937)&lt;ref&gt;Lux, H., "Säuren" und "Basen" im Schmelzfluss: die Bestimmung. der Sauerstoffionen-Konzentration. Ztschr. Elektrochem. 1939, 45(4),. 303–309&lt;/ref&gt;
* Invented the "hanging melt" method which made it possible to study extremely aggressive molten salt systems, such as alkali oxides.
* Investigated salts of metals in unusual oxidation states, such as bivalent [[chromium]] or pentavalent [[manganese]].
* Published a number of books including "Anorganisch-chemische Experimentierkunst" (''Inorganic-chemical experimental art'') and "Praktikum der quantitativen anorganischen Analyse" (''Practical course of the quantitative inorganic analysis'') which were translated into many languages and used by many analytic chemists.

'''High Mowing School''' is an independent [[Private school|private]], [[co-educational]], day and [[boarding school]], located in [[Wilton, New Hampshire|Wilton]], [[New Hampshire]], in the [[United States]]. High Mowing is the oldest [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] [[high school]] in Canada or the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruenzel|first1=David|title=The Waldorf Way|url=http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/1995/10/01/02waldor.h07.html|publisher=Education Week|accessdate=27 October 2014|date=1 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only Waldorf [[boarding school]] in the United States. It is a high school (grades 9 through 12). It was founded in 1942.

==History==
Nestled in the [[Monadnock Region]] of southern New Hampshire, the school's campus was once the family home of its founder, Beulah Hepburn Emmet, a teacher who was displeased with the politics in the [[state school|public school]] in [[Connecticut]] in which she taught. Both the school and its name are rooted in its hilltop farm location. Inspired by the writings and educational theories of [[Rudolf Steiner]], Mrs. Emmet opened the school in 1942. It is the first Waldorf high school to have been founded in North America. Since that time, the casual comfort of the old farm site has welcomed teenagers from around the globe. Students experience the Waldorf curriculum, as they live and work in close proximity to their teachers and classmates. High Mowing is the only Waldorf high school on the continent to offer a boarding program as well as a day school.

The name, "High Mowing", has its roots in [[New England]]'s colonial past. The practice of cutting or mowing hayfields to feed farm animals was a long-standing tradition there. According to European custom, these hayfields were often called "mowings" by the early settlers. A "high mowing" referred to a hilltop field, regarded as a perfect name for a school with high ambitions for its students. It was also believed to be an ideal setting for young adults to grow intellectually, artistically and socially, while living and learning with students from the region and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.highmowing.org/Page/About/History |title=History of High Mowing School |accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
A [[liberal arts]] curriculum meant to promote "engaged and active learning" forms the basis of High Mowing's academics. Each school day begins, for each grade, with "Main Lesson Block" – an integrative hour and 45 minute class that runs for between three and four weeks. Subjects for block classes encompass history, literature, drama, science, and mathematics. Students create their own "Block Book" for each class of the work they create during their study of the block material. Approximately one third of blocks are devoted to the sciences and one third to historical subjects. Others focus on drama, literature, or math. Examples of blocks include World Religions, Russian Literature, Government, Economics, Geology, Zoology &amp; Evolution, Biochemistry, Atomic Theory, Surveying &amp; Trigonometry, Dante, Greek Drama, Permutations and Combinations, Thermodynamics, History Through Art, and History through Architecture.

Block classes are followed by track classes, typically four each day. These include English, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, History, World Languages, and Studio and Performing Arts. Many of these are required courses for underclassmen and are taken in sequence beginning with the introductory course. Four years of track classes are required in the subjects Language Arts, Natural Sciences, and Studio &amp; Performing Arts, three years in Mathematics and Physical Education, and two in World Language and History. Electives are courses freely chosen by students and are more common to upperclassmen who have completed core requirements. Examples of electives include Naturalist, Great Novels, French, Spanish, and German, Philosophy, Biology, Physics, Filmmaking and Digital Arts, Eurythmy, Drawing and Painting, Woodwork, and Pottery.

Special programs include:  naturalist, fine and applied arts, apprenticeship pottery program, farm and garden program, and an annual, immersive, interest-based two week "Projects Block." The Waldorf curriculum for each grade is developmentally-based, focusing on the central question that students typically encounter at that age.  High Mowing is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] and the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America.

==Demographics==
The demographic breakdown of the 108 students enrolled for 2013–14 was:&lt;ref name="ed.gov" /&gt;
{{div col}}
*Native American/Alaskan – 0%
*Asian/Pacific islanders – 6.5%

==Traditions==

===Chapel===
Chapel, held on Sunday nights on campus, was originally a weekly spiritual/religious event begun by the school's founder, Mrs. Emmet. It now typically occurs less frequently and is designed to allow students and faculty to "reflect on the changing world and our responsibilities to it." Members of the broader community such as parents and alumni, as well as faculty and students, are invited to give talks at Chapel. Boarding students are required to attend Chapel while it is optional for day students.

===Christmas Block===

====Greens Sunday====
Students returning from [[Thanksgiving]] Break attend school on Sunday afternoon to commemorate the beginning of the holiday season. Among other activities, they gather pine branches and laurels from the surrounding woods to make wreaths and other decorations. A large [[Christmas tree]] is brought into the main room of the main building on campus. Afterward, the [[Advent]] Chapel is held.

====Caroling chapel====
At the caroling chapel, students and faculty sing [[Christmas carol]]s while the tree is decorated.

====Nativity====
The annual depiction of the story of the [[birth of Jesus]] is a theatrical and musical event originally designed by Mrs. Emmet. It involves [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], the angel [[Gabriel]], numerous other angels, a host of shepherds, and the [[Biblical Magi|Three Kings]]. A sizable percentage of the student body participates in the short play, which is followed by the Snow Goose Party, an annual students-only event.

====The Yule Festival====
This event has been held every year since the school's founding on the night before Winter Break. It is preceded by an all-school holiday dinner, and semi-formal dress is appreciated. The festival has a number of built-in traditions including a skit by the "fools", a movement-based rendition of the carol "[[Twelve Days of Christmas|A Partridge in a Pear Tree]]" by seniors, the reading of a Christmas story from the Bible in as many languages as are spoken in the school community, the [[Yule Log]], [[wassail]]ing, and the presentation of the Christmas book, a compilation of artwork (generally holiday-themed) made of the contributions of all students.

===May Day===
May Day takes place in the spring and is meant to celebrate the end of winter and the new season. The event is open to the public and involves a number of events and activities. These include a pottery sale, musical performances, cake walks, games and other entertainment for children, a grease pole with a twenty dollar bill at the top, a cow plop competition (in which the winner is the one onto whose pre-purchased field space an ushered-in cow first excretes fecal matter), and the Maypole Dance. The [[Maypole]] is a tall wooden pole buried in the ground on the center green-space and is a metaphor for the fertility of spring. Students hold colored bands originating at the top of the pole and dance around each other on the ground, creating a weave pattern of the fabric on the pole. Another tradition, the May Day Play, is a skit put on by students and faculty. Initially Queen and King Winter (played by faculty members) attempt to proclaim the predominance of winter over spring, backing up their assertions by tossing ice and icicles into the crowd. Eventually the Spring Fairy enters and proclaims that spring is nigh and that the representatives of Winter should be gone. At one point the audience is asked which they would prefer, Winter or Spring, at which point (most) everyone cheers for "Spring". The Spring Fairy typically sprinkles flower petals and other plant materials on audience members as well as Queen and King Winter. They are eventually "driven off" and the Queen and King of Spring (played by students) are crowned to commemorate the season.

==Athletics==

High Mowing considers regular physical activity essential to the well-being of its students. Every student participates in Morning Activity before Main Lesson Block, which changes with the block. Activities include [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate (frisbee)]], [[yoga]], dance, walking, and games. Afternoon activities include both team sports and other activities. High Mowing is a member of [[NEPSAC]] District Two and competes with other New England schools with Men's/Women's Soccer in the fall, Men's/Women's Basketball in the winter, and Men's Baseball and Women's Lacrosse in the spring. Other afternoon activities may include, depending on the year and season, cross-country running, skiing, and hiking. [[Physical education]] requirements fulfilled by participation in afternoon activities are necessary to graduate from High Mowing.

==Notable alumni==
* [[David E. Blackmer]], audio electronics inventor
* [[Austin Chick]], film director, screenwriter and producer
* [[Nancy Huston]], novelist
* [[Julianna Margulies]], actress
* [[Judson Mills]], actor
* [[John Fitzallen Moore]], physicist and innovator

==Notable events==

{{Data Visualization}}
'''Information design''' is the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters efficient and effective understanding of it. The term has come to be used specifically for [[graphic design]] for displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression. Information design is closely related to the field of [[data visualization]] and is often taught as part of graphic design courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.design.ccsu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Information design is explanation design. It explains facts of the universe and leads to knowledge and informed action.&lt;ref&gt;Per Mollerup,  Data Design: Visualising quantities, locations, connections, Bloomsbury Academic, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term 'information design' emerged as a [[interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] area of study in the 1970s. Some [[graphic designer]]s started to use the term, and it was consolidated with the publication of the ''Information Design Journal'' in 1979, and later with the setting up of the related International Institute for Information Design (IIID) in 1987 and  [[Information Design Association]] (IDA) in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robwaller.org/IDA_origins_RW.pdf |title=The Origins of the Information Design Association |publisher=University of Reading |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, [[Edward Tufte]] produced a book on information design called ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''.
The term [[information graphics]] tends to be used by those primarily concerned with diagramming and display of quantitative information.

In [[technical communication]], information design refers to creating an information structure for a set of information aimed at specified audiences. It can be practiced on different scales.
* On a large scale, it implies choosing relevant content and dividing it into separate manuals by audience and purpose.
* On a medium scale, it means organizing the content in each manual and making sure that overviews, concepts, examples, references, and definitions are included and that topics follow an organizing principle.
* On a fine scale, it includes logical development of topics, emphasis on what's important, clear writing, navigational clues, and even page design, choice of font, and use of white space.
Similar skills for organization and structure are brought to bear in designing [[web site]]s, with additional constraints and functions that earn a designer the title information architect.
In [[computer science]] and [[information technology]], 'information design' is sometimes a rough synonym for (but is not necessarily the same discipline as) [[information architecture]], the design of [[information system]]s, [[database]]s, or [[data structure]]s.  This sense includes [[data modeling]] and [[process analysis]].
{{Citation needed span|text=In the United States, the title of information designer is sometimes used by graphic designers who specialize in creating websites.|date=April 2018|reason=}} The skill set of the information designer, as the title is applied more globally, is closer to that of the [[information architecture|information architect]] in the U.S.

==Early examples==
[[Image:Minard.png|thumb|350px|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram of [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's March]] - an early example of an information graphic.]]
Information design is associated with the age of technology but it does have historical roots. Early instances of modern information design include these effective examples:
* [[William Playfair]]'s [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], [[pie chart|pie]], and [[area chart]]s illustrating England's trade (1786 and 1801)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anychart.com/blog/2015/12/23/first-area-charts-history/ |title=First Ever Area Charts Created 200+ Years Ago |publisher=AnyChart|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tufte&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufte|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Tufte|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|year=1983|publisher=Graphics Press|location=Cheshire, Connecticut|ISBN=0961392142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s spot maps, which pinpointed the source of a deadly cholera outbreak in 1850s London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crosier|first1=Scott|title=John Snow: The London Cholera Epidemic of 1854|url=http://webprojects.oit.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/science/science_reading/8.html|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram depicting Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Charles Joseph Minard: Mapping Napoleon's March, 1861|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/58|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[Isotype (pictograms)|International Picture Language]] of the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popova|first=Maria|title=The Invention of ISOTYPE: How a Vintage Visual Language Paved the Way for the Infographics Age|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/03/08/the-transformer-isotype/|publisher=Brain Pickings|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Florence Nightingale]]'s information graphic depicting army mortality rates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Small|first1=Hugh|title=Florence Nightingale's statistical diagrams|url=http://www.florence-nightingale-avenging-angel.co.uk/GraphicsPaper/Graphics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 1812-1813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.  [[Edward Tufte]] wrote in 1983 that: "It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn."&lt;ref name=Tufte /&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:DALY disability affected life year infographic.svg|thumb|A visual definition of [[Disability Adjusted Life Year]]]]
[[File:Bangalore Outbound Trains Frequency Chart.png|thumb|350px|Visualization of the frequency of outbound trains from [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. Based on the work of [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]]]
Information design can be used for broad audiences (such as signs in airports) or specific audiences (such as personalized telephone bills).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Design FAQ|url=http://www.bogieland.com/infodesign_faq.htm|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting work often seeks to improve a user's trust of a product (such as medicine packaging inserts, operational instructions for industrial machinery and information for emergencies).

Governments and regulatory authorities have legislated about a number of information design issues, such as the minimum size of type in financial small print, the labeling of ingredients in processed food, and the testing of medicine labeling. Examples of this are the [[Truth in Lending Act]] in the USA, which introduced the [[Schumer box]] (a concise summary of charges for people applying for a credit card), and the Guideline on the Readability of the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use (European Commission, Revision 1, 12 January 2009).

Professor [[Edward Tufte]] explained that users of information displays are executing particular ''analytical tasks''  such as making comparisons or determining causality. The ''design principle'' of the information graphic should support the analytical task, showing the comparison or causality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Y4SxgfGCg Edward Tufte-Presentation-August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simplicity ==
Simplicity is a major concern in information design. The aim is clarity. Simplification of messages may imply quantitative reduction but is not restricted to that. Sometimes more
information means more clarity. Also, simplicity is a highly subjective matter and should always be evaluated with the information user in mind. Simplicity can be easy when following five simple steps when it comes to information design: 1. Tell the truth, 2. Get to the point, 3. Pick the right tool for the job, 4. Highlight what is important, 5. Of course, keep it simple. These steps will help an information designer narrow down results, as well as keeping their audience engaged. &lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Nancy.

'''Institute for Manufacturing''' (IfM) is part of the Cambridge University Engineering Department. The IfM integrates research and education with practical application in industry. It disseminates its research findings via a University-owned knowledge transfer company, IfM ECS.
 
All areas of the IfM work closely with industry. Research is undertaken in collaboration with companies, ensuring its relevance to industrial needs and the rapid dissemination of new ideas and approaches. The IfM’s education programmes combine a thorough grounding in management and manufacturing technology with the chance to put theory into practice via industry-based projects.

Its interests encompass a broad range of manufacturing activities, from understanding markets and technologies, through process and product design to production and supply chain operations and through-life services; all within an economics and policy context. As well, it has several groups working on technological aspects of manufacturing.

== Location ==
The IfM [[Alan Reece]] building on the University's West Cambridge Site. Previously, the Institute occupied the former Cambridge University Press building in Mill Lane.

== Research ==
The IfM's research is carried out within 15 main research prorgammes, each concentrating on a particular theme, and covering the full spectrum of technology, management and policy issues.
Research is typically multi-disciplinary, and research projects frequently involve more than one centre.
Typically co-ordinated in collaboration with industry, the research develops practical techniques for companies to improve their strategies, operations and technologies. the findings are disseminated through courses, conferences, workbooks and direct services to industry.

== Education ==
Education programmes are widely valued for the comprehensive grounding they provide in engineering, management and economic principles. Students benefit from contact with world-class researchers as well as with experienced industrial professionals. Company-based projects are a significant feature of the programmes, enabling students to apply what they have learned to real industrial problems.

===Undergraduate===
Its undergraduate programme is known as 'MET' (Manufacturing Engineering Tripos). The course forms the final two years of the University of Cambridge Engineering degree. MET integrates management, business and interpersonal skills with engineering and manufacturing knowledge and industrial engagement. The programme's core is combined with opportunities to put theory into practice via student projects.

===Postgraduate===
Postgraduate courses are the twelve month MPhil courses on 'Industrial Systems Manufacture and Management' (ISMM). Students spend more than half the course in companies in the UK or mainland Europe. Participants have modules in various aspects of manufacturing, operations and supply chain, and general business management; as well as four industrial projects in manufacturing operations, marketing and new business development.

===PhD===
The IfM also has a large number of PhD students following research degrees covering management, technology and policy issues.

===MRes and PhD in Ultra Precision===
The IfM hosts the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Ultra Precision and offers programmes in many advanced ultra precision technologies.

===Executive and Professional Development===
Developing a range of tailored and open courses based on research carried out at the Institute for Manufacturing.

== IfM Education and Consultancy Services ==
IfM Education and Consultancy Services Ltd (IfM ECS) is a university-owned company, embedded within the IfM and responsible for the IfM’s knowledge transfer and dissemination activities. IfM ECS involves a team of experienced industrial professionals who are an integral part of the Institute but who have professional rather than academic expertise. They work closely with IfM research centres to ensure a seamless exchange of ideas between industry and the University. They engage with companies via a programme of education and consultancy services, short courses and events. Projects range from small-scale operational improvements for local companies&lt;ref name="SME Support Programmes"&gt;{{

The '''University of London Institute of Computer Science ''' ('''ICS''') was an Institute based in London in England. The Institute was founded by the [[University of London]] to support and provide academic research, postgraduate teaching, computer services and network services. It was founded as the University of London's Computer Unit at some point in the 1950s, changed its name to the Institute of Computer Science in the 1960s, and dissolved in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Its status as a pioneer institution serving research, teaching and computing services has not been widely recognised. This entry is only the beginning of a description. The Institute deserves a full history which should preferably be written while many of its staff and graduates are still alive.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The exact date of foundation remains to be established, but the Institute appears to have already existed by the 1950s. [[Richard Buckingham]] was Director, first of the Computer Unit and later of the Institute of Computer Science, from 1957 to 1973.&lt;ref&gt;'BUCKINGHAM, Prof. Richard Arthur', in ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who Was Who]]'' (London: A &amp; C Black), [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U171411, online edition] by [[Oxford University Press]], December 2012. Retrieved 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of Institute had been given by 1962, when John Buxton became one of its lecturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/12/john-buxton-obituary | title= Obituary John Buxton | work= The Guardian | accessdate=12 November 2009 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Campbell-Kelly | date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dissolved in 1974 and its Director moved to [[Birkbeck College]]. Some of the material in this description of the institute is derived from a history of the School of Computer Science &amp; Information System at that college&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/50years/50yearsofcomputing.pdf | title=Birkbeck, University of London, School of Computer Science &amp; Information Systems, A Short History }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
The Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Science of the Institute was one of the first courses in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Samet |first1= P. | url= http://www.icfcst.kiev.ua/symposium/proceedings/samet.pdf | title= The Evolution of Computer Science Teaching and Research in the UK | year=1998 | journal= Proc. Computers in Europe: Past, Present and Future }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett also ran informal courses, at the Institute and at the London College of Printing, to explain computer typesetting to officials of the trade unions concerned with the printing industry.&lt;ref name=typeset&gt;Michael P. Barnett, ''Computer typesetting, experiments and prospects'', MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of distinguished software and hardware engineers and scientists taught and supervised the M.Sc. and Ph.D degrees awarded by the Institute (see Staff above). Prominent graduates of the Institute include –
Michael Newman, Professor of Information Systems, Manchester Business School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515080807/http://www.php.portals.mbs.ac.uk/Default.aspx?TabId=1184|title=Profile|date=15 May 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Fiddian, Professor and Head of Department of Computer Science, Cardiff University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702121653/http://cardiff.ac.uk/staffnews/articles/obituary-professor-nicholas-john-fiddian.html|title=Obituary: Professor Nicholas John Fiddian|date=2 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gautam Mitra, OptiRisk Systems Ltd, Professor of Computational Optimisation, Brunel University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optirisk-systems.com/about_team.asp|title=About: The Team|website=www.optirisk-systems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer Services==
The Institute provided early mainframe computer services on an Atlas computer, as the University of London Atlas Computing Service. The [[Atlas Computer (Manchester)]] was an early transistor machine and only three ever existed. A number of pioneering programmes were developed on the ICS Atlas including the CPL1 Compiler, A General Fourier Synthesis Program, A Computer Technique for Optimizing the Sites and Heights of Transmission Line Towers and even an early work in computing for English [[Change Ringing]]. All of these are described in papers under Research above.
When the Institute closed, services were taken over by the [[University of London Computer Centre]] (ULCC)
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.ulcc.ac.uk/about-us/history.html | title= A brief history of ULCC }}&lt;/ref&gt; although ULCC did initially run in parallel with the Atlas service.

==Networking==
The Institute provided batch and interactive communications.
The main services were the first UK Arpanet node and [[Remote Job Entry]] (RJE) to the IBM 360/195&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP2195.html |title= IBM 360/195  }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Rutherford Laboratory in Oxfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://ip-doc.com/ietf/rfc588| title= LONDON NODE IS NOW UP }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Arpanet node was the first in Europe and is therefore the first place where what became the Internet was available in Europe.
The RJE service using a [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[PDP-9]] emulating an [[IBM 1130]] (presumably a [[Houston Automatic Spooling Priority|HASP]] workstation) was the first remote user of the 360/195,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/ca/literature/annual_reports/p009.htm | title= Rutherford Laboratory Annual Report 1973 Computing Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked with [[Jules Dassin]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] and other politically liberal theatrical personalities. Although he attended some meetings of the [[Communist Party]], Corey never joined.&lt;ref name = nyt-obit-2002-08 /&gt; A [[World War II]] veteran, Corey served in the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name = nyt-obit-2002-08 /&gt; His memoir, "Improvising Out Loud: My Life Teaching Hollywood How To Act" which he wrote with his daughter, Emily Corey, is published by the University Press of Kentucky. His longtime friend and former student, [[Leonard Nimoy]], wrote the foreword for the book. 

=== Hollywood ===
Corey moved to [[Hollywood]] in 1940 and became a highly respected [[character actor]]. One of his film roles was in  ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'' (1951), which was later edited to a two-part episode of the television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', retitled "The Unknown People". His portrayal of a xenophobic vigilante coincidentally reflected what was about to happen to him. Prior to that, Corey appeared in [[Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman]], (1943) as one of the men who discover the body of the vagrant Freddy Jolly.

=== Blacklisted ===
Corey's career was halted in the early 1950s, when he was summoned before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). Corey refused to give names of alleged Communists and subversives in the entertainment industry&lt;ref name="pb" /&gt; and went so far as to ridicule the panel by offering critiques of the testimony of the previous witnesses. This behavior led to his being blacklisted for 12 years. "Most of us were retired Reds. We had left it, at least I had, years before," Corey told Patrick McGilligan, the co-author of ''Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist'' ({{ISBN|978-0-312-17046-2}}), who also teaches film at Marquette University. "The only issue was, did you want to just give them their token names so you could continue your career, or not? I had no impulse to defend a political point of view that no longer interested me particularly&amp;nbsp;... They just wanted two new names so they could hand out more [[subpoenas]]."

During his blacklisting Corey drew upon his experience in various actors' workshops (including the [[Actors' Lab]], which he helped establish&lt;ref name="Gordon2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Stanislavsky in America: An Actor's Workbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88qNAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=10 September 2014|date=2009-10-23|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-25293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by seeking work as an acting teacher.  He soon became one of the most influential teachers in Hollywood. His students, at various times, included [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], [[James Coburn]], [[Richard Chamberlain]], [[James Dean]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Peter Fonda]], [[Michael Forest]], [[James Hong]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Shirley Knight]], [[Bruce Lee]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.improvisingoutloud.com/acting-like-bruce-lee/|title=Acting Like Bruce Lee|date=January 4, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Penny Marshall]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Darrell M. Smith]], [[Diane Varsi]], [[Sharon Tate]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Sally Forrest]], [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[Robert Towne]], [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Robin Williams]].

=== Back to work in the 1960s ===
In 1962, Corey began working in films again, and remained active into the 1990s. He played Hoban in ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'' (1965) and Tom Chaney the principal villain in ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969) and was Sheriff Bledsoe in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (also 1969) who warned [[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid|Butch and Sundance]] that no good would come of their breaking the law. In ''[[Seconds (film)|Seconds]]'' (1966), a science fiction drama film directed by [[John Frankenheimer]] and starring [[Rock Hudson]], Corey with [[Will Geer]] and [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] played wealthy executives who opt to restart their lives with a new identity, an ironic parallel to the real life of Corey and the other principal actors (excepting Hudson) who had also been proscribed from Hollywood films during the "Blacklist" years of the 1950s.

Corey played a police detective in the psychological thriller ''[[The Premonition (1976 film)|The Premonition]]'' (1976) and he reprised the role of sheriff Bledsoe in the prequel ''[[Butch and Sundance: The Early Days]]'' (1979). He also played [[Wild Bill Hickok]] in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970). Corey directed some of the screen tests for ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), which can be seen in the DVD extras, and played [[Lex Luthor]] in several try-outs.
Also starred in Up River 1979 film played the part of Bagshaw.

===Television===

Corey made guest appearances on many television series. Corey appeared as murder victim Carl Bascom in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode, "The Case of the Reckless Rockhound" (1964). He featured on [[science fiction]] series too, including an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' ("[[O.B.I.T.]]", 1963) in which he played Byron Lomax; ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' ("[[The Cloud Minders]]", 1969) in which he played High Advisor Plasus; as Caspay in ''[[Beneath the Planet of the Apes]]'' (1970) and ''[[Babylon 5]]'' ("[[Z'ha'dum]]", 1996) in which he played Justin. 

He was also the voice of the villain [[Silvermane]] (in elderly form) in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' (1994). He also appeared in the short-lived ''[[Paper Moon (TV series)|Paper Moon]]'' (1974), a comedy about a father and his presumed daughter roaming through the [[American Midwest]] during the [[Great Depression]] based on the film. Corey had a memorable role in a third-season episode of ''[[Night Court]]'' (1986) as a burned-out judge who had lost his grip on reality.

He played Dr. Miles Talmadge on ''[[Night Gallery#Season 1: 1970.E2.80.9371|Night Gallery]]'' season one episode one, "The Dead Man", on December 16, 1970. Corey detailed his television work on [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]'' in an interview in February 1973 aboard the [[SS Atlantic (1953)#University at Sea|SS ''Universe Campus'']] of Chapman College. He was proudest of this work, for which he received an Emmy nomination.

PATTABHI JOIS IS NO MORE. RIP.], [[churumuri]]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Hassan district|Hassan]], [[Karnataka]], South India.

==Early life==
Jois's father was an astrologer, priest, and landholder. His mother took care of the house and the nine children - five girls and four boys - of whom Pattabhi Jois was the fifth. From the age of five, he was instructed in Sanskrit and rituals by his father, which is standard training for [[Brahmin]] boys.  No one else in his family learned yoga.&lt;ref name="Stern, Eddie 2002"&gt;Stern, Eddie.  Foreword in "Yoga Mala" by Pattabhi Jois. New York: North Point Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encounter with T. Krishnamacharya and education==
In 1927, at the age of 12, Jois attended a lecture and demonstration at the Jubilee Hall&lt;ref name="mysorean"&gt;[http://churumuri.wordpress.com/2006/06/29/the-second-most-famous-mysorean-in-the-world/ The second most famous Mysorean in the world], [[churumuri]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hassan, Karnataka|Hassan]] by [[Tirumalai Krishnamacharya|T. Krishnamacharya]]&lt;ref name="raghuram"&gt;[http://churumuri.wordpress.com/2009/05/19/at-the-pearly-gates-in-dhoti-vibhuti-pump-shoes/ At the pearly gates in dhoti, vibhuti, pump shoes], Sunaad Raghuram, [[churumuri]]&lt;/ref&gt; and became his student the very next day. For two years Jois remained in Kowshika and practiced with Krishnamacharya every day.&lt;ref name="Stern, Eddie 2002" /&gt; Jois never told his family he was practicing yoga. He would rise early, go to practice, and then attend school.

In 1930, Jois ran away from home to [[Mysore]] to study [[Sanskrit]], with 2 rupees.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/asia/21jois.html Krishna Pattabhi Jois, Leading Expert in Yoga, Dies at 93], [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time Krishnamacharya departed Hassan to teach elsewhere. Two years later, Jois was reunited with Krishnamacharya, who had also made his way to Mysore. During this time, the [[Maharaja]] of Mysore, [[Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV|Krishna Rajendra Wodeyar]], had become seriously ill and it is said that Krishnamacharya had healed him, through yoga, where others had failed. The Maharaja became Krishnamacharya's patron and established a Yoga shala for him at the [[Jaganmohan Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Singleton |first= Mark |title= Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice |year= 2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press | edition = Kindle | location= USA |isbn= 978-0195395341 |page= Kindle Locations 3481–3482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jois often accompanied Krishnamacharya in demonstrations.&lt;ref name="bakasana"&gt;[http://churumuri.wordpress.com/2009/05/18/jois-work-bad-lady-why-forgetting-bakasana/ Jois @ work: 'Bad lady, why forgetting bakasana?'], [[churumuri]]&lt;/ref&gt; and would occasionally assist Krishnamacharya in class and teach in his absence.&lt;ref name="Stern 2002"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stern |first= Eddie |title= Yoga Mala |year= 2002 |publisher= North Point Press | location= USA |isbn= 978-0865477513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jois studied with Krishnamacharya from 1927 to 1929 in his own village, and then in Mysore from 1932 to 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | others = Interview by R.

==Family life==
On the full moon of June 1933, when Jois was 18 years old, he married Savitramma,&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; who affectionately came to be known as Amma by Pattabhi Jois's family and students alike. They had three children: Saraswathi, Mañju and Ramesh.&lt;ref name="kpjayi-kpj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kpjayi.org/biographies/k-pattabhi-jois|title=K. Pattabhi Jois|publisher=Shri K Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316003304/http://kpjayi.org/biographies/k-pattabhi-jois|archivedate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ayny-guruji"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayny.org/sri-k-pattabhi-jois|title=Guruji|publisher=Ashtanga Yoga New York|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614134328/http://ayny.org/sri-k-pattabhi-jois|archivedate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, with the help of Jois' students, he purchased a home in the section of town called Lakshmipuram. According to Tim Miller, Pattabhi Jois continued to practice asanas until his son Ramesh committed suicide when Jois was in his early 60s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashtanga.com/html/article_miller_tim.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Saraswathi Jois had two children who continue to teach yoga today, [[R. Sharath Jois]] and Sharmila Mahesh. They both trained in yoga under Pattabhi Jois from childhood. Pattabhi Jois took an active role in raising his grandchildren. Sharath began assisting Pattabhi Jois in his teaching in 1990, and continued to do so until Jois passed away in 2009. At that time, Sharath took over as the main teacher and director of the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute, which he renamed as the ''K Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute (KPJAYI)'' in honor of his grandfather.

Manju Jois left India in the late 1970s to settle in the United States. He continues to teach yoga internationally, and is married with one child.

==Career==
The [[Maharaja]] of Mysore would at times attend classes when Jois was assisting and offered Jois a teaching position at the Sanskrit College in Mysore with a salary, scholarship to the college and room and board.&lt;ref name="Stern 2002"/&gt;

Pattabhi Jois held a yoga teaching position at the Sanskrit College&lt;ref name="bakasana"/&gt; of Maharaja from 1937 to 1973,&lt;ref name="huffington"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/waylon-lewis/pattabhi-jois-founder-of_b_204938.html Pattabhi Jois, Founder of Ashtanga Yoga, Passes Away at Age 93], [[Huffington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt; becoming ''vidwan'' (professor) in 1956,&lt;ref name="huffington"/&gt; as well as being Honorary Professor of Yoga at the Government College of Indian Medicine from 1976 to 1978.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt; He taught there until 1973, when he left to devote himself fulltime to teach yoga at his yoga shala.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

He wrote the book ''Yoga Mālā'', in [[Kannada]] in 1958, and it was published in 1962, but was not published in English until 1999.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; The film ''Guru'' was made about him by Robert Wilkins.&lt;ref name="movie"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0818677/ Guru], a film by Robert Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoga Korunta==
In 1924 Krishnamacharya spent time in the Calcutta University Library researching an ancient text called the ''[[Yoga Korunta]]'' which was badly damaged and had many missing portions.&lt;ref name="Stern 2002"/&gt; Krishnamacharya had learned this text from his teacher Rama Mohan Brahmachari in the Himalayas.&lt;ref name="Donahaye 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Donahaye |first=Guy |title=Guruji: A Portrait of Sri K Pattabhi Jois Through The Eyes of His Students |year=2010 |publisher=D&amp;M Publishers Inc | location=USA |isbn=978-0-86547-749-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jois began his studies with Krishnamacharya in 1927 and was taught the method from the ''[[Yoga Korunta]]''.&lt;ref name="Stern 2002"/&gt; An entire system of practices including Pranayama, Bandhas, (core muscular and energetic locks) and Dristi (visual focal points) were included along with āsanas and vinyāsa &lt;ref name="Donahaye 2010"/&gt; Pattabhi Jois then went on to teach it to others as he was taught by Krishnamacharya.&lt;ref name="Sjoman 1999 49"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sjoman |first=N.E. |title=The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace |year=1999 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=New Delhi, India |isbn=81-7017-389-2 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jois indicated that he had never seen this text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/465 |title=Krishnamacharya's Legacy |last1=Ruiz |first1=Fernando |publisher=Yoga Journal |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stern 2002"/&gt; Even though the authenticity of this text is difficult or impossible to validate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singleton |first=Mark |title=Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=USA |isbn=978-0195395341 |page=}} {{page needed|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally accepted as the source of Ashtanga Yoga as taught by Pattabhi Jois.&lt;ref name="Stern 2002"/&gt; It is important to characterize the ''[[Yoga Korunta]]'' as having been transmitted and passed on from teacher to student. Perhaps each student received the teachings but not in physical form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Byrne |first=Jean |title=Gurus of Modern Yoga |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press | location=USA |isbn=9780199938704 |editor=Mark Singleton |editor2=Ellen Goldberg}} {{page needed|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major component of Ashtanga Yoga that was not in the Yoga Korunta nor was it part of the early teachings of Krishnamacharya was [[Surya Namaskara]] A &amp; B.&lt;ref name="Donahaye 2010"/&gt; Surya Namaskara A &amp; B, which establish the āsana practice, were devised by Pattabhi Jois based on references to ancient texts.&lt;ref name="Donahaye 2010"/&gt; Detailed explanations of Surya Namaskara A &amp; B are in Jois's book Yoga Mala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jois |first=Sri K Pattabhi |title=Yoga Mala |year=2002 |publisher=North Point Press | location=USA |isbn=978-0865477513 |page=}} {{page needed|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==KPJAYI==
In 1948, Jois established the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute at their home in Lakshmipuram.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8058905.stm Yoga pioneer Pattabhi Jois dies], [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he built an extension in the back of the house for a yoga hall.&lt;ref name="Stern, Eddie 2002"/&gt;

In 1964, a [[Belgium|Belgian]] named [[André Van Lysebeth]] spent two months with Jois learning the primary and intermediate series of the [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]] system. Not long afterward, van Lysebeth wrote a book called ''J'apprends le Yoga'' (1967, English title: ''Yoga Self-Taught'') which mentioned Jois and included his address. This marked the beginning of Westerners coming to Mysore to study yoga.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sjoman 1999 49"/&gt; The first Americans came, after Jois's son Manju demonstrated yoga at Swami Gitananda's ashram in Pondicherry.&lt;ref name="Stern, Eddie 2002"/&gt;

Jois gained attention from celebrity students including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]&lt;ref&gt;Yoga Body&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate the increasing number of students coming to study, he opened a new school in Gokulam in 2002.&lt;ref name="Donahue 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last= Donahue |first= Guy |title= Guruji: A Portrait of Sri K. Pattabhi Jois Through the Eyes of His Students |year= 2012 |publisher= New York: North Point Press | location= USA |isbn= 978-0374532833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pattabhi Jois spent more than 70 years of his life dedicated to practicing and teaching Ashtanga yoga.&lt;ref name="Donahue 2012"/&gt; Jois continued to teach at the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in [[Mysore]], now located in the neighbourhood of Gokulam,&lt;ref name="churumuriRIP"/&gt; with his only daughter Saraswathi Rangaswamy (b. 1941) and his grandson Sharath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sonima.com/yoga/honoring-tradition/ |title= Sharath Jois on Honoring Tradition |last1= Jois |first1= Sharath |work= |publisher= Sonima}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 18 May 2009 when he died aged 93 of [[death by natural causes|natural causes]].

==Parampara==
[[Parampara]] is the passing of knowledge from teacher to student and the importance of the ongoing relationship between the two. "This lies at the heart of Jois's Ashtanga Yoga."&lt;ref name="Byrne 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last= Byrne |first= Jean |title= Gurus of Modern Yoga |year= 2014 |publisher= Oxford University Press | location= USA |isbn= 978-0199938728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jois's Ashtanga Yoga is passed on in a traditional manner and the teacher certification process is extensive, by which a student, through many years of daily practice and extended trips to Mysore, India, becomes a 'lineage holder' also known as 'Authorized' or 'Certified'.&lt;ref name="Byrne 2014"/&gt; Jois studied with his teacher Krishnamacharya for many years and in turn, expected the same from his students in order to be able to teach correctly and appropriately.&lt;ref name="Byrne 2014"/&gt; "Professional development requirements such as these are arguably some of the most stringent found in Modern Postural Yoga lineages, and they derive directly from the emphasis that both Pattabhi Jois and [his grandson] [[R. Sharath Jois]] have placed on Parampara."&lt;ref name="Byrne 2014"/&gt;

As of 2017, there are three levels of teacher recognition 'Authorized Level 1', 'Authorized Level 2', and 'Certified'. In brief, 'Authorized Level 1' teachers are able to teach the primary series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Zuniga |first= Magnolia |title= Strength and Grace; A Collection of Essays by women of Ashtanga Yoga |year= 2015 |publisher= Ekaminhale | location= Canada |isbn= 9781770847170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Authorized Level 2' teachers are able to teach up to where they learned in intermediate series. Certified teachers have learned the third series and beyond and are able to teach accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Zuniga |first= Magnolia |title= Strength and Grace; A Collection of Essays by women of Ashtanga Yoga |year= 2015 |publisher= Ekaminhale | location= Canada |isbn= 9781770847170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International travels==
His first trip to the West was in 1974 to South America, to deliver a lecture in Sanskrit at an international yoga conference.&lt;ref name="huffington"/&gt; In 1975 he stayed for four months in [[Encinitas]], California, marking the beginning of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga in the US.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-pattabhi-jois22-2009may22,0,190982.story K. Pattabhi Jois, leading teacher of Ashtanga yoga, dies at 94], [[Los Angeles Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; He had said on many occasions that only twenty or thirty students practiced Ashtanga Yoga in America then, but, 'gradually, gradually, in twenty years, it will be fully spreading'&lt;ref name="Stern, Eddie 2002"/&gt;  He would return to the US several times over the next 20 years, to teach yoga at Encinitas and beyond.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; 

==Obituaries==
A range of obituaries for Jois were published in many newspapers and journals, including the New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/world/asia/21jois.html?_r=0}} |title= Krishna Pattabhi Jois, Leading Expert in Yoga, Dies at 93 |&lt;/ref&gt; the Financial Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/23d87998-4cb1-11de-a6c5-00144feabdc0.html}} |title= The guru who introduced Ashtanga yoga to the west&lt;/ref&gt; the BBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8058905.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Guardian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/08/k-pattabhi-jois-obituary-yoga}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Huffington Post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/waylon-lewis/pattabhi-jois-founder-of_b_204938.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Economist,&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.economist.com/node/13776890 | title = Pattabhi Jois | work = The Economist | date = 4 June 2009  |  archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20111203071358/http://www.economist.com/node/13776890 | archivedate = 3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the LA Times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-pattabhi-jois22-2009may22-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Times of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2085393.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A student David Life, co-founder of [[Jivamukti Yoga]] school in Manhattan, has said of him, "He was not a monk or a renunciate; he was fearless about combining the path of yogi with the path of participant. He never saw it as separate from our lives. He thought that anyone could attain to yoga if they had the desire and the enthusiasm."&lt;ref name="Fortini"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/57201/|title=Ommm Sweaty: Saluting yoga entrepreneur Jois|last=Fortini|first=Amanda|date=15–22 June 2009|publisher=''New York''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
According to [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], Jois was assigned to teach [[asana]] at the Sanskrit Pathshala when the yogashala of Krishnamacharya was opened in 1933 and was "never a regular student."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Singleton |first= Mark |title= Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice |year= 2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press | edition = Kindle | location= USA |isbn= 978-0195395341 |page= Kindle Locations 3658–3664}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Iyengar |first= B.

''[[The Economist]]'' published an obituary that questioned Jois's adherence to the yogic principle of [[brahmacharya]] or sexual continence and made the accusation that his female students received different "adjustments" from his male students.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt; ''[[CounterPunch]]'' in a magazine article indicated that Jois was a "reported sexual abuser of students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/04/19/the-travails-of-yoga-mogul-bikram-choudhury/ |title      = The Travails of Yoga Mogul Bikram Choudhury |last       = Lawrence |first      = Stewart |date       = 19 April 2013 |website    = CounterPunch |publisher  = |accessdate = 7 May 2013  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130507093057/http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/04/19/the-travails-of-yoga-mogul-bikram-choudhury | archivedate = 7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations of inappropriate touching of women by Jois during yoga classes also surfaced on ''YogaDork,''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://yogadork.com/news/good-touch-bad-touch-gurus-power-and-adjusting-vs-groping-on-the-yoga-mat/

The same obituary questioned Jois's adherence to the yogic principle of [[ahimsa]] or non-violence and highlighted that "a good number of Mr Jois's students seemed constantly to be limping around with injured knees or backs because they had received his "adjustments", yanking them into Lotus, the splits or a backbend."&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt; Adjustments by Jois have been characterized as "overwhelming, producing fear and extreme discomfort in students as they are pushed beyond their physical and psychological comfort zones in often-difficult, even dangerous asana.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first= Mark |editor1-last= Singleton |  editor2-first= Jean |editor2-last= Byrne |title= Yoga in the Modern World: Contemporary Perspectives | edition= Kindle | year= 2008 |publisher= Routledge  |location= New York, USA |isbn= 0415452589 |page= Kindle Locations 4178–4179}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's unlikely that students would have endured such adjustments without faith and trust in the teachers and the method. This connection between teacher and student is how Jois taught Parampara, the passing of knowledge as it occurs between teacher and student.&lt;ref name="Byrne 2014"/&gt; Pattabhi Jois did not call himself a guru, but is considered the master guru, or teacher, of Ashtanga Yoga.&lt;ref name="Byrne 2014"/&gt;

On April 25, 2018, [[The Walrus]] magazine published a article entitled "Yoga's Culture of Sexual Abuse: Nine Women Tell Their Stories".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewalrus.ca/yogas-culture-of-sexual-abuse-nine-women-tell-their-stories/|title=Yoga’s Culture of Sexual Abuse: Nine Women Tell Their Stories|work=The Walrus|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article features the first-person testimonies of nine women who allege being sexually assaulted by Pattabhi Jois. The incidents date from 1992 to 2002. One of the women quoted in this article, Karen Rain, was formerly known as Karen Haberman. She studied with Jois in Mysuru for a total of two years between 1994 and 1998. She has archived her writings about Jois on her blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://karenrainashtangayogaandmetoo.wordpress.com/|title=Karen Rain:  Ashtanga Yoga and #MeToo|website=Karen Rain:  Ashtanga Yoga and #MeToo|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, she describes the challenges involved in coming forward with her story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://matthewremski.com/wordpress/karen-rain-speaks-about-pattabhi-jois-and-recovering-from-sexual-and-spiritual-abuse-video-interview/|title=Karen Rain Speaks About Pattabhi Jois and Recovering from Sexual and Spiritual Abuse — Video Interview – Matthew Remski|website=matthewremski.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the revelations and to Rain's call for reform in the Ashtanga Yoga community, several Ashtanga teachers authorized by the Jois family have committed to restorative actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://saraiyoga.wordpress.com/2018/03/17/the-sexual-misconduct-of-pattabhi-jois-my-thoughts-accountability-and-5-changes-to-pledge-my-support-for-the-victims/|title=The Sexual Misconduct of Pattabhi Jois: My Thoughts, Accountability, and 5 Changes to Pledge my Support for the Victims|date=2018-03-17|work=Directions in Yoga|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.balanceyogawellness.com/blog/need-talk-sexual-abuse-committed-pattabhi-jois/|title=We help stressed-out people get balanced and energized with affordable yoga|work=Balance Yoga &amp; Wellness|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Jois's grandson, [[R. Sharath Jois]], is a major contributor to his legacy. Sharath Jois currently leads the ashtanga yoga community as the director and main teacher at the K. Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga Institute (KPJAYI) in Mysuru, where thousands of yoga students study each year. Sharath also teams with yoga practitioner and philanthropist Sonia Klein Jones to create '''Jois Yoga''' in honor of K. Pattabhi Jois.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2012/04/krishna-pattanbhi-trophy-wife-ashtanga-yoga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://m.indianexpress.com/news/yoga-is-as-yoga-does/945051/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://greenwich.patch.com/groups/business-news/p/east-meets-west-greenwich-s-ashtanga-yoga-studio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/peace-love-and-misunderstanding-a-billionaires-wife-spreads-her-message-of-calm-one-yoga-pose-at-a-time/story-e6frf00i-1226315273654&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailylife.com.au/news-and-views/dl-opinion/the-corruption-of-yoga-20120712-21y58.html&lt;/ref&gt; Jones's organization Sonima often provides organizational support to Sharath's world tours, and produces online programs that provide supplementary teaching tools for Ashtanga. Jois's daughter, Saraswathi, and granddaughter, Sharmila, run a successful yoga school in Mysuru and travel the world on teaching tours. Pattabhi Jois's lineage is also carried on by the students that he officially authorized and certified.&lt;ref name="Byrne 2014"/&gt;

The result of Jois's contribution to the practice of yoga can be found in yoga classes across the globe.&lt;ref name="Donahaye 2010"/&gt; Jois devised Surya Namaskara A &amp; B (the "sun salutations") in reference to a passage from the Vedas, and they are commonly found at the beginning of even non-Ashtanga classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guruji: A Portrait of Sri K Pattabhi Jois Through The Eyes of His Students|last=Donahaye|first=Guy|publisher=D&amp;M Publishers Inc|year=2010|isbn=978-0-86547-749-0|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12834">A '''learning object''' is "a collection of content items, practice items, and assessment items that are combined based on a single learning objective".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cisco Systems|title=Reusable information object strategy|url=http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/779/ibs/solutions/learning/whitepapers/el_cisco_rio.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530223125/http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/779/ibs/solutions/learning/whitepapers/el_cisco_rio.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is credited to Wayne Hodgins, and dates from a working group in 1994 bearing the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gerard|first=R.W.|title="Shaping the mind: Computers in education", In N. A. Sciences, Applied Science and Technological Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTcrAAAAYAAJ|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept encompassed by 'Learning Objects' is known by numerous other terms, including: content objects, chunks, educational objects, information objects, intelligent objects, knowledge bits, knowledge objects, learning components, media objects, reusable curriculum components, nuggets, reusable information objects, reusable learning objects, testable reusable units of cognition, training components, and units of learning.

The core idea of the use of learning objects is characterized by the following: discoverability, reusability, and interoperability. To support discoverability, learning objects are described by Learning Object Metadata, formalized as IEEE 1484.12 [[Learning object metadata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://129.115.100.158/txlor/docs/IEEE_LOM_1484_12_1_v1_Final_Draft.pdf IEEE 1484.12 Learning Object Metadata]&lt;/ref&gt; To support reusability, the IMS Consortium proposed a series of specifications such as the IMS [[Content package]]. And to support interoperability, the U.S. military's [[Advanced Distributed Learning]] organization created the [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.adlnet.gov/Technologies/scorm/SCORMSDocuments/2004%204th%20Edition/Overview.aspx SCORM 2004 4th Edition Version 1.1 Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209134708/http://legacy.adlnet.gov/Technologies/scorm/SCORMSDocuments/2004%204th%20Edition/Overview.aspx |date=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning objects were designed in order to reduce the cost of learning, standardize learning content, and to enable the use and reuse of learning content by learning management systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/32/378|Stephen Downes|Learning Objects: Resources For Distance Education Worldwide|The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning|Volume 2 Number 1 2001|Athabasca University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) defines a learning object as "any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Learning Technology Standards Committee|2002|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiappe defined Learning Objects as: "A digital self-contained and reusable entity, with a clear educational purpose, with at least three internal and editable components: content, learning activities and elements of context. The learning objects must have an external structure of information to facilitate their identification, storage and retrieval: the metadata."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chiappe|Segovia|Rincon|2007|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following definitions focus on the relation between learning object and digital media.  RLO-CETL, a British inter-university Learning Objects Center, defines "reusable learning objects" as "web-based interactive chunks of e-learning designed to explain a stand-alone learning objective".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter= Learning Objects|url=http://www.rlo-cetl.ac.uk/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=235&amp;Itemid=28|title=RLO-CETL: Reusable Learning Objects|accessdate=2008-04-29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Rehak and Robin Mason define it as "a digitized entity which can be used, reused or referenced during technology supported learning".&lt;ref&gt;http://129.115.100.158/txlor/docs/IEEE_LOM_1484_12_1_v1_Final_Draft.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rehak|Mason|2003|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapting a definition from the Wisconsin Online Resource Center, Robert J. Beck suggests that learning objects have the following key characteristics:

* Learning objects are a new way of thinking about learning content. Traditionally, content comes in a several hour chunk.  Learning objects are much smaller units of learning, typically ranging from 2 minutes to 15 minutes.
* Are self-contained – each learning object can be taken independently
* Are reusable – a single learning object may be used in multiple contexts for multiple purposes
* Can be aggregated – learning objects can be grouped into larger collections of content, including traditional course structures
* Are tagged with metadata – every learning object has descriptive information allowing it to be easily found by a search&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;{{citation|last=Beck|first=Robert J.|chapter=What Are Learning Objects?|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/cie/learning_objects.cfm?gid=56 | title=Learning Objects|publisher=Center for International Education, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
The following is a list of some of the types of information that may be included in a learning object and its metadata:
* General Course Descriptive Data, including: course identifiers, language of content (English, Spanish, etc.), subject area (Maths, Reading, etc.), descriptive text, descriptive keywords
* Life Cycle, including: version, status
* Instructional Content, including: text, web pages, images, sound, video
* Glossary of Terms, including: terms, definition, acronyms
* Quizzes and Assessments, including: questions, answers
* Rights, including: cost, copyrights, restrictions on Use
* Relationships to Other Courses, including prerequisite courses
* Educational Level, including: grade level, age range, typical learning time, and difficulty. [IEEE 1484.12.1:2002]
*Typology as defined by Churchill (2007): presentation, practice, simulation, conceptual models, information, and contextual representation &lt;ref name="Churchill"&gt;Churchill, D. (2007). Towards a useful classification of learning objects. ''Educational Technology Research &amp; Development, 55(5)'', 479-497.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metadata==
One of the key issues in using learning objects is their identification by search engines or content management systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  This is usually facilitated by assigning descriptive [[learning object metadata]]. Just as a book in a library has a record in the [[card catalog]], learning objects must also be tagged with metadata.  The most important pieces of metadata typically associated with a learning object include:
# '''objective:''' The educational objective the learning object is instructing
# '''prerequisites:''' The list of skills (typically represented as objectives) which the learner must know before viewing the learning object
# '''topic:''' Typically represented in a taxonomy, the topic the learning object is instructing
# '''interactivity:''' The [[Interaction Model]] of the learning object.
# '''technology requirements:''' The required system requirements to view the learning object.

==Mutability==

A mutated learning object is, according to Michael Shaw, a learning object that has been "re-purposed and/or re-engineered, changed or simply re-used in some way different from its original intended design". Shaw also introduces the term "contextual learning object", to describe a learning object that has been "designed to have specific meaning and purpose to an intended learner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shaw|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portability==
Before any institution invests a great deal of time and energy into building high-quality e-learning content (which can cost over $10,000 per classroom hour),&lt;ref&gt;Rumble, Greville. 2001. The Cost and Costing of Networked Learning. Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, Volume 5, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; it needs to consider how this content can be easily loaded into a [[Learning Management System]]. It is possible for example, to package learning objects with [[SCORM]] specification and load it in [[Moodle]] Learning Management System or [[Desire2Learn]] Learning Environment.

If all of the properties of a course can be precisely defined in a common format, the content can be serialized into a standard format such as [[XML]] and loaded into other systems.  When it is considered that some e-learning courses need to include video, mathematical equations using [[MathML]], chemistry equations using [[Chemical Markup Language|CML]] and other complex structures, the issues become very complex, especially if the systems needs to understand and validate each structure and then place it correctly in a database.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Criticism==
In 2001, David Wiley criticized learning object theory in his paper, [https://web.archive.org/web/20041019162710/http://rclt.usu.edu/whitepapers/paradox.html The Reusability Paradox] which is [http://www.darcynorman.net/2003/08/21/addressing-the-reusability-paradox/ summarized by D'Arcy Norman] as, ''If a learning object is useful in a particular context, by definition it is not reusable in a different context. If a learning object is reusable in many contexts, it isn’t particularly useful in any.'' 
In [http://www.learningspaces.org/papers/objections.html Three Objections to Learning Objects and E-learning Standards], Norm Friesen, Canada Research Chair in E-Learning Practices at Thompson Rivers University, points out that the word ''neutrality'' in itself implies ''a state or position that is antithetical ... to pedagogy and teaching.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19113">This is a '''list of schools in [[Port Moresby]]''', the capital of [[Papua New Guinea]].

Papua New Guinea's education system is divided into two sections: the international school system, which is administered by theems or the [[International Baccalaureate]]; and the national school system, which consists of elementary (K–2), primary (3–8) and secondary (9–11) schools. Competitive examinations are held in year 10 for entry into the country's four national high schools, of which one is located in Port Moresby. 

Port Moresby is internally divided into wards or town areas. They are:

* Town/Hanuabada — along the west coast, including the CBD
* Tokarara/Hohola — northeast of the CBD
* Kila Kila/Kaugere — along the south coast
* Boroko/Korobosea — centred on [[Boroko]] east of the CBD
* Gordons/Saraga — eastern suburbs, north of Boroko
* Waigani/University — northern suburbs
* Gerehu — outer northern suburbs
* Bomana — north-eastern townships beyond the metropolitan area

The '''Massachusetts Tests for Educator Licensure''' (MTEL) program was initiated by the [[Massachusetts Department of Education]] in 1998. It is part of a statewide education reform initiative for educators seeking PreKindergarten to Grade 12 licenses. The MTEL program includes a test of communication and literacy skills as well as tests of subject matter knowledge. The tests are designed to ensure that Massachusetts educators can communicate adequately with students, parents/guardians, and other educators and that they are knowledgeable in the subject matter of the license sought. The MTEL program was expanded in November 2004 to include tests for candidates seeking vocational technical and adult basic education licenses.

The MTEL is developed, administered, and scored by National Evaluation Systems, Inc. (NES), which is now known as the Evaluation Systems group of [[Pearson Education]].  Tests are scored on a criterion-based system, where examinees must attain a certain score based on standards established by the state.  Constructed (written &amp; oral) components of the tests are scored using a focused holistic scoring model (similar to [[holistic grading]]).  Like regular holistic scoring, responses are viewed for their overall quality, not just for individual mistakes.  However this is done according to specific criteria that the state has established (i.e., grammar, support, etc.).  These criteria vary by test and assignment.

It is accepted in a few other states as a credential for teaching.

'''Musical Futures''' is a movement to reshape music education - driven by teachers, for teachers. At its heart is a set of [[Pedagogy|pedagogies]] that bring non-formal teaching and informal learning approaches into more formal contexts, to provide engaging, sustainable and relevant music making activities for all young people.

==Background==
Funded and managed by the [[Paul Hamlyn#Paul Hamlyn Foundation|Paul Hamlyn Foundation]], the initial aim of Musical Futures was to devise new and imaginative ways of engaging young people, aged 11–19, in music activities. Following a year of consultation in 2003, the Paul Hamlyn Foundation identified the following objectives:
* To understand the factors affecting young people's commitment to, and sustained engagement in, musical participation.
* To develop ways in which the diverse musical needs of young people can be met and their experience of music making enhanced.
* To realise viable, sustainable and transferable models which can support a national strategy for music and young people
* To investigate, and make recommendations on, the most appropriate methods of mentoring and supporting young people's preferences and skills
* To find ways of validating and (where appropriate) accrediting all forms of young people's musical experiences, including those undertaken without supervision
* To facilitate support for music trainees, leaders, teachers and performers/composers through the provision of development opportunities which highlight collaborative working practices

After inviting applications from consortia of local music education providers, three Pathfinder Local Authority Music Services – in [https://web.archive.org/web/20080618173542/http://www.educationleeds.co.uk/DisplayText.aspx?section=8&amp;Pageno=505 Leeds], Nottingham and Hertfordshire - were commissioned to explore new approaches and structures which might ensure that more young people participate in better quality musical experiences for longer.

==Learning models==

===Informal Learning in the Music Classroom===
A programme of informal learning, drawing on the real-life learning practices of popular musicians, developed by Lucy Green, [[Institute of Education]] and [http://www.thegrid.org.uk/learning/hertsmusic/index.shtml Hertfordshire Music Service]. It involves students in self-directed, independent learning, in friendship groups, working on a series of musical tasks.

===The Whole Curriculum Approach===
A programme developed by [http://www.collegest.org.uk/ Nottingham City Music Service] that aims to develop school music beyond the classroom confines for Year 7-8 students, and involve them in real musical activity, in genuine musical situations and environments. It aims to draw together good practice from classroom, instrumental and extra-curricular music into an integrated package for students.

===Personalising Extra-Curricular Learning===
An approach by Education Leeds Artforms to empower young people to make positive, informed choices about the music they engage with beyond the classroom.

==NUMU==
[http://www.numu.org.uk NUMU] is a safe online community for young people to showcase their music; collaborate, compete and develop their talent. Schools can join NUMU and establish their own school record label, and enable their students to create an online portfolio of work.

==Intended beneficiaries==
Musical Futures was initially designed to benefit secondary school students, with a particular focus on 12–14 year olds, as this has long been an age at which students seem to lose interest in music learning in school. However, teachers in primary and tertiary education have successfully adopted Musical Futures approaches. These approaches have also been tailored for students in challenging circumstances, for example students with special educational needs, or in Young Offenders Institutes and Pupil Referral Units.

[[File:Kimberly Oliver 2006 Teacher of the year.jpg|right|thumb|270px| 2006 Teacher of the Year, Kimberly Oliver, with President George W. Bush.]]
The '''National Teacher of the Year''' is a professional [[award]] in the [[United States]].  The program began in 1952, as a project by the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]] (CCSSO), and aims to reward excellence in [[teacher|teaching]]. It is sponsored by [[ING Group|ING]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsso.org/projects/National_Teacher_of_the_Year/|title=National Teacher of the Year|publisher=Council of Chief State School Officers|accessdate=2006-05-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060507031153/http://www.ccsso.org/projects/National_Teacher_of_the_Year/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
[[Image:JasonKamras TeacheroftheYear.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jason Kamras]], 2005 Teacher of the Year, and President George W. Bush in the [[White House Rose Garden]].]]

Every year, nominations are made by students, principals, teachers and administrators for the ''State Teacher of the Year'' awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsso.org/projects/national_teacher_of_the_year/National_Teachers/189.cfm Sharon M. Draper: 1997 National Teacher of the Year]&lt;/ref&gt; The profiles of the winners from all 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] and the [[Department of Defense Education Activity]] are submitted to a selection committee made up of representatives from each of the major education organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsso.org/projects/national_teacher_of_the_year/national_teachers/8144.cfm Kimberly Oliver: 2006 National Teacher of the Year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616025647/http://www.ccsso.org/projects/national_teacher_of_the_year/national_teachers/8144.cfm |date=2010-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee then reviews the data for each candidate and selects four finalists. The winner is chosen from these finalists based on their biography, interview and eight essays they must submit. The award is traditionally presented by the [[President of the United States]] in the [[White House Rose Garden]]. 

Although there are no clearly defined requirements the committee looks for:
* The ability to inspire children from all backgrounds and abilities
* The respect of colleagues, students, and parents
* Activity in the community
* The ability to fulfill the duties of the award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsso.org/projects/National_Teacher_of_the_Year/Selection_Process/|title=Selection Process|publisher=[[Council of Chief State School Officers]]|accessdate=2006-05-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051212060018/http://www.ccsso.org/projects/National_Teacher_of_the_Year/Selection_Process/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==

The National Teacher spends a year away from his or her teaching duties to serve as a spokesman and advocate for the teaching profession. The teacher's state and district continues to pay his/her salary in this year. The arrangements for travel and speaking engagements during the recognition year are taken care of by the CCSSO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsso.org/projects/National_Teacher_of_the_Year/Recognition_Year/|title=Recognition Year|publisher=[[Council of Chief State School Officers]]|accessdate=2006-05-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060522234341/http://www.ccsso.org/projects/National_Teacher_of_the_Year/Recognition_Year/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gingerich grew up in a family of [[Amish Mennonite]]s in eastern [[Iowa]], where his grandfather was a farmer and a lay preacher.  Yet Gingerich felt no contradiction between religion and science: "My grandfather had an open mind about the age of the Earth," he says, "and never mentioned evolution. Remember, these were people of great humility, who only expressed an opinion on something when they knew a lot about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7488">The '''Professional Doctorate in Engineering''' ('''PDEng''') is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] degree awarded to graduates of a Technological Designer ([[engineering]]) program that develop their students' capabilities to work within a professional context. These programs focus on applied techniques and design, in their respective engineering fields. The technological PDEng designer programs were initiated at the request of the Dutch high-tech industry. High-tech companies need professionals who can design and develop complex new products and processes and offer innovative solutions. All programs work closely together with high-tech industry, offering trainees the opportunity to participate in large-scale, interdisciplinary design projects. With this cooperation, PDEng programs provide trainees a valuable network of contacts in industry. Each program covers a different technological field, for example managing complex architectural construction projects, designing mechanisms for user interfaces for consumer products or developing high-tech software systems for software-intensive systems. Participation in a program that awards the abbreviation PDEng requires at least a [[Master's degree]] in a related field.&lt;ref name="requirements-and-eligibility"&gt;[http://tue.nl/en/university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/education/graduate-programs/pdeng-programs/software-technology/application-for-traineeship/requirements-and-eligibility/ Requirements and eligibility]&lt;/ref&gt; The PDEng may sometimes be confused with a Phd, but they are not comperable.

PDEng degrees can be obtained at three technical Universities in the Netherlands, [[Delft University of Technology]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], and [[University of Twente]]. Between these universities interscholastic cooperation programs exist like the [[4TU]] Federation and its [[Stan Ackermans Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3tu.nl/en/education/sai/ Stan Ackermans Institute home page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929231208/http://www.3tu.nl/en/education/sai/ |date=2010-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==
The two-year, full-time post-master programs all lead to a Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) degree. The programs are certified by the [[Dutch Certification Committee for Technological Design Programmes|Dutch Certification Committee for Technological Design Programs]] (CCTO or Dutch: ''Nederlandse Certificatiecommissie voor Opleidingen tot Technologisch Ontwerper''), which represents the interests of the organization of Netherlands Industry Entrepreneurs and Employers ([https://www.vno-ncw.nl/over-vno-ncw/english VNO-NCW/MKB Netherlands]) and the [[KIVI NIRIA|Royal Netherlands Society of Engineers]] (Dutch: ''Koninklijk Instituut Van Ingenieurs - KIVI'').&lt;ref name="afdelingen.kiviniria.net"&gt;KIVI, ''Ned. Certificatiecom. voor Opleidingen tot Technologisch Ontwerper'' | {{cite web |url=http://afdelingen.kiviniria.net/ccto |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130221204351/http://afdelingen.kiviniria.net/ccto |archivedate=2013-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCTO's main goal is to ensure that such degrees hold to the high standards established by both academia and industry. The committee reviews these degree programs every five years to ensure continued standards compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tue.nl/en/university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/education/graduate-programs/pdeng-programs/software-technology/about-st/pdeng-degree-program/ PDEng degree program]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the PDEng and PhD are both recognised as postgraduate degrees, they are not the same. A PDEng is practically oriented and does not require a body of original academic research to graduate.

== History ==
The Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) name owes its existence to the adoption of the [[Academic degree|Bachelor/Master]] (Ba/Ma) degree system after the [[Bologna Process]]. While most Dutch universities adopted the Ba/Ma system in 2001, the PDEng was known as the official [[Master of Technical Design]] (MTD) degree until 2004. From that date the Executive Boards of TU/e, TUD and UT decided jointly to use PDEng. 

== Admission ==
Application is open to university graduates from the Netherlands and other countries. A trainee must hold at least a Master of Science degree or equivalent, preferably in the exact sciences. Besides, applicant must have an interest in designing solutions for complex technological problems. There can be an assessment and selection procedure before entering a program. The PDEng programs use strict selection criteria to ensure the required high quality. Excellent marks, motivation and a design-oriented attitude are vitally important. A trainee should also have an excellent command of the English language. The exact admission and selection procedures are different at the three locations. All applications are judged by the Selection Committee.&lt;ref name="requirements-and-eligibility" /&gt;

He was known for his co-starring role as Mickey Deane in the [[reality television]] spoof ''[[The Comeback (TV series)|The Comeback]]''&lt;ref name="etvs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terrace|first1=Vincent|title=Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010|date=2011|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-6477-7|pages=201–202|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Mr. Lunt in the short-lived series ''[[Running Wilde]]''. He also wrote over 100 plays.

==Biography==
Born in [[Kentucky]], Morris obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English and art from the [[University of Dayton]], as well as a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in playwriting from the [[Catholic University of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/robert-michael-morris-dead-comeback-actor-was-77-1008834 |title=Robert Michael Morris, ''The Comeback'' Actor, Dies at 77 |last=Huff |first=Lauren |date=May 30, 2017 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught both high school and college theater before becoming a professional actor relatively late in life and relocating to [[New York City]]. "I moved to New York so I could find out what it was like to be a professional actor because my students were all asking questions and all I had was academic knowledge. I didn't have any real professional knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newnownext.com/robert-michael-morris-is-running-wilde-again/09/2010/2/ Robert Michael Morris is “Running Wilde” Again]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Patrick King]], one of Morris's students, and [[Lisa Kudrow]] wrote his role in ''The Comeback'' with him in mind; King asked him to audition.&lt;ref name ="RMM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2017/05/robert-michael-morris-dies-the-comeback-actor-died-1202104330/ |title=Robert Michael Morris Dies: ''The Comeback'' Actor Was 77 |last=Petski |first=Denise |date=May 30, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris also had notable guest appearances in such series as ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[Better Things (TV series)|Better Things]]'' and ''[[2 Broke Girls]]''.

The '''Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative''' is a philanthropic programme that pairs gifted young artists with internationally recognized masters in: architecture, dance, film, literature, music, theatre and visual arts, for a year of creative collaboration in a one-to-one mentoring relationship. The initiative was launched in 2002 and runs every two years, with the aim of making significant contributions to the arts worldwide. In keeping with its tradition of supporting individual excellence, Rolex seeks to give emerging artists time to learn, create and grow.

==History==
The mentoring programme grew out of a desire by [[Rolex]], the Swiss watch company, to support artists in the same way that the Rolex Awards for Enterprise were supporting scientists, conservationists and explorers. Two years of research in the 1990s led to the discovery that mentorship of individual young artists was lacking, and the international initiative was founded to nurture young dancers, musicians, theatre directors, writers, visual artists and film-makers.

Unparalleled in corporate philanthropy today, in terms of the Rolex Arts Initiative’s scope and international reach, the programme is grounded in an age-old practice: the passing down of the world’s artistic heritage from one generation to the next through mentoring.

==Programme==
The mentor-protégé selection process begins with the establishment of an Advisory Board of distinguished artists and arts practitioners from around the world who suggest, endorse and help recruit the mentors. Once the mentors ─ one in each discipline ─ have agreed to take part, each gives a profile of his/her ideal protégé. The potential protégés are young, extremely talented artists, who have already made great headway in their careers, but who will benefit tremendously by collaborating with a master for a year.

Tailor-made panels of nominators, one for each discipline, act as “talent scouts” to identify suitable protégé candidates from their extensive network of contacts worldwide; the potential candidates are approached and asked to submit applications detailing their credentials and career motivation, which are used by the respective panel to select three or four protégé finalists. Finally, each mentor meets with the finalists to choose his/her protégé. The best talent is inevitably discovered through this process.

The mentor and protégé work closely together during the mentoring period, with each pair deciding the most effective way of interacting. Except for the minimum of six weeks (30 working days) that the mentor-protégé pairs are required to spend together, there are few rules to the programme. Most spend considerably more time interacting, sharing knowledge and experience.

Rolex grants each mentor an honorarium of 100,000 Swiss francs, and each protégé 40,000 Swiss francs during the mentoring period (plus travel and expenses) and 30,000 Swiss francs after the mentoring period for the creation of a new piece of work, a publication, performance or public event.

The programme is managed by a specialized team at the company’s headquarters in Geneva. After the mentoring year, Rolex continues to keep in touch with the protégés, following their careers and documenting their progress on the Arts Initiative website [http://www.rolexmentorprotege.com/ rolexmentorprotege.com].

==Outcome==
The initiative has been highly acclaimed by both mentors and protégés. Protégés gain from the mentor-protégé relationship, and, over the years, mentors have expressed how they have gained new energy, insights and inspiration from the younger artists. Cross-fertilization also exists through the alumni network of artists who have participated in the programme.

{{nihongo|'''Shueisha Inc.'''|株式会社集英社|Kabushiki Gaisha Shūeisha|"Shueisha Publishing Co., Ltd."}} is a Japanese company headquartered in [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The company was founded in 1925 as the entertainment-related publishing division of Japanese publisher [[Shogakukan]]. The following year, '''Shueisha''' became a separate, independent company. 

Magazines published by Shueisha include ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', ''[[Weekly Young Jump]]'', ''[[Non-no]]'' and ''[[Ultra Jump]]''. Shueisha, along with [[Shogakukan]], owns [[Viz Media]], which publishes [[manga]] from all three companies in North America.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.shueisha.co.jp/company_info/ 会社案内]." Shueisha.

== History ==
[[File:Shuueisha01(tokyo).JPG|thumb|The exterior of Shueisha's main headquarters in [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]]]
In 1925, Shueisha was created by major publishing company [[Shogakukan]] (founded in 1922). {{nihongo|2=尋常小學一年女生|3=Jinjō Shōgaku Ichinen Josei}} became the first novel published by Shueisha in collaboration with Shogakukan—the temporary home of Shueisha. In 1927, two novels titled ''Danshi Ehon'', and ''Joshi Ehon'' were created. In 1928, Shueisha was hired to edit {{nihongo|''Gendai Humor Zenshū|現代ユーモア全集''|Gendai Yūmoa Zenshū}}, a compilation. ''Gendai Humor Zenshū'' continued 12 volumes, some issues being ''Joshi Shinjidai Eishūji-chō'' and {{nihongo||新時代英習字帳|Shinjidai Eishūji-chō}}. In the 1930s another novel called ''Tantei-ki Dan'' was launched and ''Gendai Humor Zenshū'' was completed in 24 volumes. In 1931 two more novels were launched, ''Danshi Yōchien'' and ''Joshi Yōchien''.

After [[World War II]], Shueisha started publishing a manga line called ''Omoshiro Book''. ''Omoshiro Book'' published a picture book called ''Shōnen Ōja'', which became a huge hit among boys and girls. The first full volume of ''Shōnen Ōja'' was released as ''Shōnen Ōja Oitachi Hen'', which became an instant best-seller. 

The first magazine published by Shueisha was ''Akaruku Tanoshii Shōnen-Shōjo Zasshi''. In September 1949, ''Omoshiro Book'' was made into a magazine with all the contents of the former line. In 1950, a special edition of the magazine was published under the title ''Hinomaru''. In addition to ''Omoshiro Book'', a female version was published in 1951: ''Shōjo Book'' which featured manga aimed at adolescent girls. The Hitotsubashi building of Shueisha became completely independent in 1952. In that year, ''Omoshiro Book'' ceased publication and ''Myōjō'' began publication as a monthly magazine. The series of ''Omoshiro Book'' were published in [[bunkoban]] editions under the ''Omoshiro Manga Bunko'' line.&lt;ref name="History 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shueisha.co.jp/history/history2.html |title=集英社 小史｜草創期 |publisher=Shueisha |year= |accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A novel called ''Yoiko Yōchien'' was published and ''Omoshiro Book'' was replaced with another [[children's manga]] magazine called ''Yōnen Book''.

In 1955, the success of ''Shōjo Book'' led to the publication of currently running ''[[Ribon]]''. The novel ''Joshi Yōchien Kobato'' began publication in 1958. On November 23, a special issue of ''Myōjō'' titled ''Weekly Myōjō'' was released. In 1951, another male edition of ''Shōjo Book'' was released, ''[[Shōnen Book]]'' was made, and ''Shōjo Book'' series were released in bunkoban editions under the ''Shōjo Manga Bunko'' imprint. In the 1960s, another spin-off issue of ''Myōjō'' was released called ''Bessatsu Weekly Myōjō''. 

Shueisha continues to publish many novels. A compilation of many ''Omoshiro Book'' series was released as ''Shōnen-Shōjo Nippon Rekishi Zenshū'' complete in 12 volumes. Many other books were published including ''Hirosuke Yōnen Dōwa Bungaku Zenshū'', ''Hatachi no Sekkei'', ''Dōdō Taru Jinsei'', ''Shinjin Nama Gekijō'', and ''Gaikoku kara Kita Shingo Jiten''. In 1962, Shueisha published a female version of ''Myōjō'' titled ''Josei Myōjō'' and many more novels. In 1963, Shueisha began publication of the widely successful ''[[Margaret (magazine)|Margaret]]'' with the additional offshoot ''Bessatsu Margaret''. The novel ''Ukiyo-e Hanga'' was released complete in seven volumes, and the picture book ''Sekai 100 Nin no Monogatari Zenshū'' was released in the usual 12. In 1964, ''Kanshi Taikei'' was released in 24 volumes plus a reprint. In that year a line of novels, ''Compact Books'', was made and a line of manga called ''Televi-Books'' ("televi": short for "television"). In 1965, two more magazines were made: ''[[Cobalt (magazine)|Cobalt]]'' and the ''Shōnen Book'' offshoot ''Bessatsu Shōnen Book''.&lt;ref name="History 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shueisha.co.jp/history/history3.html|title=集英社 小史｜成長期|publisher=Shueisha|work=|date=|author=|accessdate=2008-08-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924101814/http://www.shueisha.co.jp/history/history3.html|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Shueisha began publication of ''[[Weekly Playboy]]'', ''Seishun to Dokusho'' and ''Shōsetsu Junior''. A novel called ''Nihonbon Gaku Zenshū'' spawned a great 88 volumes. Another manga magazine was made titled ''Young Music''. ''Deluxe Margaret'' began publication in 1967 and the additional ''Margaret Comics'' and ''Ribon Comics'' lines. In 1968 the magazine ''Hoshi Young Sense'' began publication as spin-off to the short-lived ''Young Sense''. Later in that year ''Margaret'' launched the ''[[Seventeen (Japanese magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine as a Japanese version of [[Seventeen (American magazine)|the English edition]]. 

''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump|Shōnen Jump]]'' was created in the same year as a semi-weekly magazine. Another [[children's manga]] magazine was created in that year called ''Junior Comic'' and another ''Ribon'' spin-off called ''Ribon Comic''. In 1969 the magazine ''Joker'' began publication along with ''guts''. Several other novels were published. The magazine ''Bessatsu Seventeen'' began publication. In that year ''Shōnen Jump'' became a weekly anthology and changed its name to ''Weekly Shōnen Jump''. Following up the end of ''Shōnen Book'' a spin-off of ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' started at the same time as it became weekly, initially called ''Bessatsu Shōnen Jump''. It changed its name to ''[[Monthly Shōnen Jump]]'' with the second issue. 

The 1970s started with the launch of the novel magazine ''Subaru'' and in 1971 the ''[[Non-no]]'' and ''Ocean life'' magazines began publication. The novel series ''Gendai Nippon Bijutsu Zenshū'' spawned 18 volumes and became a huge seller. In 1972 ''Roadshow'' began publication and ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'' begins in the ''Margaret Comics'' line gaining massive popularity. In 1973 ''[[Playgirl]]'' magazine began publication and the novel series ''Zenshaku Kanbun Taikei'' spawning a huge 33 volumes. In 1974 ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' launched ''Akamaru Jump''.

Shueisha announced that in the summer of 2011, it would launch a new manga magazine titled ''Miracle Jump''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?manga_powerhouse_shuseisha_announces_new_magazine_16705.aspx | title = Manga powerhouse Shueisha announces new magazine | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = 2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kanzenban magazines ==
Shueisha has published many [[kanzenban]] magazines. Kanzenban magazines consist of one series being published for roughly a year and then another and so on, unlike normal [[manga magazine]]s which have a variety of series. The select series has chapters from roughly three volumes in every issue.

=== ''Monthly Comic Tokumori'' ===
{{nihongo|'''''Monthly Comic Tokumori'''''|月刊コミック特盛|Gekkan Kommiku Tokumori}} is a ''[[Seinen manga|seinen]]'' kanzenban magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/magazine/rack.cgi/magazine/tokumori.html?key=detail&amp;zashimei=tokumori&amp;janru=menc |title=月刊コミック特盛 |publisher=Shueisha |date= |accessdate=2008-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published by Shueisha's subsidiary Home-sha.&lt;ref name="Tokumori"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shueisha.co.jp/home-sha/manga/tokumori/ |title=月刊コミック特盛 |publisher=Shueisha |date= |accessdate=2008-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine currently serializes the [[samurai]]-based ''Nobunaga no Kyodai Tetsu Fune: Sengoku no Umi o Seisu'' every month.&lt;ref name="Tokumori" /&gt;

=== ''Shueisha Original'' ===
{{nihongo|'''''Shueisha Original'''''|集英社オリジナル|Shūeisha Orijinaru}} is a multi-demographic [[manga]] magazine published by Shueisha. It features an individual kanzenban of a classic Shueisha manga series. Each issue is a continuation of the last kanzenban. ''Shueisha Original'' has only featured two series which have run in the magazine for a long time. The first series was ''[[Chibi Maruko-chan]]'' from the ''[[Shōjo manga|shōjo]]'' manga anthology ''[[Ribon]]''. ''Chibi Maruko-chan'' ran in the magazine from August 2007 to January 2008. ''[[Rokudenashi Blues]]'' by [[Masanori Morita]] which ran in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' started on March 2008 and is currently running in ''Shueisha Original''.

=== ''Shueisha Remix'' ===
{{nihongo|'''''Shueisha Remix'''''|集英社リミックス|Shūeisha Rimikkusu}} is one of many kanzenban magazines published by Shueisha. ''Shueisha Remix'' magazines are split into four lines: ''Shueisha Jump Remix'', ''Shueisha Girls Remix'', ''Shueisha Home Remix'' and ''Shueisha International Remix''.

'''SirsiDynix''' is a [[United States]] [[company]] which produces [[software]] and associated services for [[library|libraries]].&lt;ref name="vista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vistaequitypartners.com/?q=company/sirsidynix|title=Vista Equity|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===SirsiDynix Corporation===
SirsiDynix was formed by the merger of the Dynix Corporation and the Sirsi Corporation in June 2005. The company is based in Lehi, Utah, and employs approximately 400 in offices worldwide.&lt;ref name="barack"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was bought out by [[Vista Equity Partners]] in December 2006, a private equity firm based in [[San Francisco, CA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://librarytechnology.org/document/12741|title=Vista Equity Partners acquires SirsiDynix|publisher=Smart Libraries Newsletter|author=Marshal Breeding|date=2007-02-01|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Davison was named SirsiDynix CEO in October 2011.
In January 2015 ICV Partners announced their acquisition of SirsiDynix from Vista Equity Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/icv-partners-announces-acquisition-of-sirsidynix-300017251.html|title=ICV Partners Announces Acquisition of SirsiDynix|publisher=ICV Partners|location=Lehi, Utah|agency=PRN Newswire|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sirsi Corporation===
The Sirsi Corporation was founded in Huntsville, Alabama in 1979 by Mike Murdock, Jacky Young, and Jim Young.&lt;ref name="sirsi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirsidynix.com/Company/|title=SirsiDynix: Company Overview|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unicorn library automation system they developed was first installed at Georgia Tech. Sirsi acquired Data Research Associates (DRA) for $51.5 million in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Michael|title=Sirsi buys data research assocs.|journal=Library Journal|volume=126|issue=11|date=15 June 2001|access-date=30 August 2015|via=Proquest|subscription=true|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/196825064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infotoday"&gt;{{Cite web

|publisher=InformationToday
|date=October 2001
|accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main product inherited from Sirsi is the Unicorn [[integrated library system]] (ILS).

===Dynix Corporation===
The Dynix&lt;!-- [[Dynix]] is not about the company, do not Wikilink to it--&gt; Corporation was founded in 1983. Their major product was the [[Dynix (software)|Dynix Automated Library System]].

In January 1992, Dynix Systems was acquired by [[Ameritech]].&lt;ref name=Breeding2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breeding|first=Marshall|title=Epixtech: A New Beginning for ALS|journal=Information Today|volume=17|issue=1|date=January 2000|accessdate=30 August 2015|url=http://www.infotoday.com/IT/jan00/breeding.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynix and NOTIS Systems (maker of [[NOTIS]]), which Ameritech purchased in October 1991, were consolidated into Ameritech Library Services (ALS) in 1994.&lt;ref name=Breeding2000 /&gt;

In November 1999, Ameritech sold Ameritech Library Systems to a pair of investment companies, the 21st Century Group and Green Leaf Ridge Company, which rebranded ALS as epixtech.&lt;ref name=Breeding2000 /&gt; In 2003, epixtech reverted to using the Dynix name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Michael|title=Dynix investing in future growth|journal=Library Journal|volume=128|issue=4|date=1 March 2003|accessdate=30 August 2015|via=Proquest|subscription=true|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/196923873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core products (ILS)==
The ILS serves libraries in various functions: cataloging, circulation, acquisitions, reserves, outreach, etc. SirsiDynix currently supports the SirsiDynix Symphony ILS and the Horizon ILS.

==Other products==

===BLUEcloud LSP===
SirsiDynix announced the BLUEcloud LSP (BCS) library services platform at their annual COSUGI users' group conference. It is a browser-based system that will integrate SirsiDynix's "administration, discovery, acquisition, and collection management applications." It can be accessed from a desktop, laptop, tablet or smart phone. BCS can integrate with both SaaS and locally hosted Horizon and Symphony systems. The BLUEcloud LSP is made up of three major components: BLUEcloud Staff, BLUEcloud Marketplace, and BLUEcloud Discovery. The first features are expected to be released by summer 2013.&lt;ref name=BCS1&gt;{{cite web|last=Breeding|first=Marshall|title=BLUEcloud Suite|url=https://librarytechnology.org/pr/17776|work=Product announcements|accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SirsiDynix will offer BCS to their customer base without forcing a data migration. The initial release will require the latest version of the ILS, but customers will then be allowed to lag behind by a version. The goal of this project was to streamline the user experience rather than changing administration interfaces for each product. This approach will stop the duplication of data and will integrate all searches across products. The majority of the new features of BCS will be included in the annual maintenance fee.&lt;ref name="LJ COSUGI"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Michael|title=At COSUGI, SirsiDynix Touts New Cloud-Based System|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2013/03/technology/at-cosugi-sirsidynix-touts-new-cloud-based-system/|work=Library Journal|accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological advances==
SirsiDynix and [[Stanford]] university libraries worked together for over a year to upgrade Stanford's library environment to support Asian and other multi-byte [[character set]]s.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web 
| title = Stanford University Libraries and SirsiDynix Partner for State-of-the-Art, Original Script Access

| accessdate = 2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; SirsiDynix has also partnered with [[3M]] to provide [[radio-frequency identification]] systems for libraries.&lt;ref name="deseret"&gt;{{cite web 
| title = High-tech checkout is OK'd for Provo library

| accessdate = 2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
On October 29, 2009, the WikiLeaks Project obtained a document &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| title = SirsiDynix Corp restricted lobby paper against Open Source technologies, Sep 2009 
| publisher = WikiLeaks
| date = 2009-10-29
| url = https://wikileaks.org/wiki/SirsiDynix_Corp_restricted_lobby_paper_against_Open_Source_technologies%2C_Sep_2009
| accessdate = 2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; from SirsiDynix taking a negative view of open source projects as compared to proprietary products, including risks of instability and insecurity. The document, which its author, Stephen Abram, claimed was not intended to be secret, set off a debate on open source within the library technology community.&lt;ref name=al&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Sean|title=Open Source Advocates Reject SirsiDynix’s Warning|journal=American Libraries|date=11 November 2009|url=http://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2009/11/11/open-source-advocates-reject-sirsidynixs-warning/|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, the company performed an upgrade of its systems at the [[Ottawa Public Library]], involving a scheduled two-day closure of all library branches, accompanied by an 11-day shutdown of online systems. However, the actual upgrade required closure of the library system for an additional two days. [[Jan Harder]], chair of Ottawa's library board, stated an intention to seek compensation from SirsiDynix for the unexpected additional upgrade work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Late+libraries+finally+back+online/2996845/story.html |title=Late, but libraries finally back online |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen |date=2010-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526195745/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Late+libraries+finally+back+online/2996845/story.html |archivedate=May 26, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22423">A '''student society''', '''student association''', '''university society''' or '''student organization''' is a [[society]] or an [[organization]], operated by [[students]] at a [[university]] or a [[college]] institution, whose membership typically consists only of students or [[alumni]].

Early notable types of student societies include the [[medieval]] so-called [[nation (university)|nation]]s of the [[University of Bologna]] and the [[University of Paris]]. Later [[Modern era]] examples include the [[Studentenverbindung]] in the [[German speaking world]], as well as the evolvement of [[fraternal order]]s for students and [[student fraternities]] internationally.

Aims may involve practice and propagation of a certain [[professional]] [[hobby]] or to promote [[professional development]] or [[philanthropic]] causes. Examples of common societies found in most universities are a [[debating|debate society]], an international student society, a [[rock music|rock society]], and student chapters of professional societies (e.g. the [[American Chemical Society]]). Not all societies are based around such a large area of interest and many universities also find themselves home to societies for many obscure hobbies such as a [[Neighbours (TV series)|Neighbours society]].

Student societies typically have open membership, thus differing from [[honor societies]], [[secret societies]], and certain [[fraternities]] that admit members by invitation only. Students typically join societies at the beginning of the school year when many societies present themselves in a societies fair and campaign to attract new members. The students may pay a membership fee to the society. Since the societies are [[non-profit organization]]s this fee is often nominal and purely exists to cover insurance or to fund society events.

Student societies may or may not be affiliated with a university's [[students' union]]. Student societies often aim to facilitate a particular activity or promote a belief system, although some explicitly require nothing more than that a member is a present or former student. Additionally, some are not affiliated with a specific university or accept non-university students.

==Examples==
Typical examples are:
* [[Civil Society]] - To encourage polite behaviour among people.
* [[Debate|Debating]] society - debates, and [[Public speaking|oratory]].
* [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] society - uniting students from one university faculty.
* [[Film]] society - to show and discuss films.
* [[Hiking]] club - Organising trips.
* [[International student]] society - Introducing international students to one another.
* [[Music]] society - student ensembles.
* [[Regional]] society - uniting students from the same region or hometown; a [[Nation (university)|student nation]].
* [[Science fiction]] society - Meeting to watch science fiction TV, films, and discuss Science fictions
* [[Taekwondo]] society, [[Karate]] club - Meeting to learn [[martial arts]].

==Student societies by location==

===Australia===
In Australia, student societies play an important role in university life by bringing together like-minded students to engage in activities the society seeks to promote.

===Belgium===

====Flanders====
In [[Flanders]], student societies play a unique role in student life. Student societies there have traditionally been [[politics|politically]] active, and they played a significant part in the 1960s division of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] into separate [[Flanders|Flemish]] and [[Wallonia|Walloon]] universities.

A student society in Flanders is led by a ''praesidium''. The head of the praesidium (and the society) is the ''[[praeses]]''. Alternative spellings are ''presidium'' and ''preses''. For most positions, Dutch names are used nowadays.

Other positions include:
* ''[[List of Latin phrases: V#vice|vice]]-praeses'': assists the praeses where needed.
* ''[[Quaestor]]'': takes care of the money.
* ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ab actis|de}}'': the secretary of the student organisation.
* ''Cantor'': Leads the [[cantus]]. &lt;!-- Latin plural of 'cantus' is simply 'cantus', as it's a noun of the fourth declension --&gt;
* ''Vertor'': Organises cultural activities.
* ''Scriptor'': Is responsible for creating a [[Magazine]].
* ''Bacchus'': Is responsible for [[alcohol]]ic beverages. (Title taken from the Roman name for [[Dionysus]])
* ''[[Dominus morum]]'': Is responsible for keeping order at a [[cantus]].
Positions are flexible, and change to meet the needs of the student organisation.

Student societies used to be politically engaged, but are now more focused on organizing [[party|parties]], [[cantus]], and [[culture|cultural]] activities.

Student societies also exist at [[institute of technology#Belgium and the Netherlands|polytechnic]]s.
&lt;!-- I assume that [[hogeschool]] is a half-translated Dutch term, but "high school" might have an altogether different meaning in the Netherlands. --&gt;

New members go through an initiation ritual before becoming full members of a Flemish student society. A new member is called ''schacht'' and has to undergo a ''baptism''. The baptism is the first step to integration in the student society. The next (and last) step to becoming a full-fledged member is the ''ontgroening''. After the ''ontgroening'', one becomes a normal member or ''commilito'' of the organization, and can join the praesidium if one so chooses. Normal members are also referred to as ''anciens''.

====Francophone Belgians====
In [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]], several types of [[francophone]] student societies exist:
* A ''cercle'' regroup students from the same faculty
* A ''regionale'' regroup students coming from the same location
* An ''ordre''  regroup students around some aspects of the student [[folklore]] or [[traditions]]

These societies sometimes have traditions dating back a hundred years, such as wearing one of the two traditional student hats: the [[:fr:Penne (folklore)|Penne]] or the [[Calotte (Belgium)|Calotte]]. Their main activity is organising and attending [[parties]] or [[festivals]] (for example, the [[24h velo (LLN)|24 hours bike ride of Louvain-la-Neuve]] or the [[St V]]).

{{See also|:fr:Folklore estudiantin en Belgique|l1=Student folklore in Belgium (French Wikipedia)}}

===Canada===
The [[Alma Mater Society of Queen's University|Alma Mater Society]] at [[Queen's University]] is the oldest such organization in [[Canada]], and currently the most extensive in regard to student involvement. It is currently a multi-million corporation employing over 500 students. The day-to-day operations of the AMS are overseen by the AMS Council which includes an annually elected three-person executive (the President, Vice-President (Operations) and Vice-President (University Affairs), selected as a slate), five commissioners who are each responsible for a specific aspect of student life, and three directors who are responsible for overseeing the AMS’ 14 corporate services.

===Estonia===
[[Estonian Students' Society]] (Estonian: Eesti Üliõpilaste Selts commonly used acronym: EÜS) is the largest and oldest all-male academical student society in [[Estonia]], which is similar to [[Baltic German]] student corporations (should not be confused with American college fraternities). It was founded in 1870 at the University of Tartu. It has over 800 members in Estonia and abroad.

In Estonia are 10 academical male student corporations. They are joined in [[League of Estonian Corporations]], which was founded on March 28, 1915 by [[Vironia (academic corporation)|Vironia]], [[Fraternitas Estica]], [[Sakala (academic corporation)|Sakala]], Ugala and [[Korporatsioon Rotalia|Rotalia]]. Estonian student corporations have hundreds of members and alumni worldwide, because after the [[Soviet annexation of Estonia]] many members fled to Western countries.

Added to them there are one female student society: [[Estonian Women Students' Society]], five female student corporations: Filiae Patriae, Indla, Lembela, Amicitia, Sororitas Estoniae.

===European-wide===
In Europe, there are several continent-wide student organisations fostering exchange among students of different [[Nationality|nationalities]] and [[cultures|Culture]], such as 
* [[European Students' Union|ESU]] (European Students' Union) -  the umbrella organisation of 44 national unions of students from 38 countries, representing over 15 million students.
* [[AEGEE]] (European Students Forum), trying to spread the [[Europe]]an idea
* [[AIESEC]] (worldwide student organisation)
* BEST (Board of European Students of Technology)
* Bonding
* [[EESTEC]] (Electrical Engineering Students' European Association)
* [[European Federation of Psychology Students' Associations|EFPSA]] - European Federation of Psychology Students' Associations
* [[European Law Students' Association|ELSA]] - European Law Students' Association
* [[European Medical Students' Association|EMSA]] - European Medical Students' Association
* ESN ([[Erasmus Student Network]]), promoting student mobility in Europe and beyond.
* [[ESTIEM]] (European Students of Industrial Engineering &amp; Management)
* [[EUROAVIA]] (European Association of Aerospace Students)
* [[IAESTE]] (worldwide student organisation)
* [[International Students of History Association]] 
* [http://oikos-international.org oikos] (worldwide student organisation)
* [[JEF]] Young European Federalists - a pan-European network promoting the idea of European Integration

There is also the [[National Unions of Students in Europe]], a representative student organisation at European level, notably within the [[Bologna process]].

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], student societies are widespread and various, though by lack of support from the universities (and by force of variety), generally do not boast many members. The most popular are the [[Studentenverbindung]]en; most of them are moderate and tolerant, although many are restricted to male or Christian members.

The counterpart to these more conservative organisations are left-wing and anti-fascist student organisations as [[Anti-Fa]] or [[Praxis (organisation)|Praxis]] (in Bavaria).

On many universities - although in many states not officially recognised - there are student representations, called '''AStA''' (Allgemeiner Studenten-Ausschuss), '''StuVe''' (Studentische Vertretung) or '''StuRa''' (Studentenrat).

Other organisations include [[European Student Associations]] and the student organisations of the [[Germany|German]] [[political party|political parties]]

Yet, there are also politically and confessionally independent, interdisciplinary and not-for-profit student organisations. One of, if not the leading one in Germany is the [[Studentenforum im Tönissteiner Kreis]] e. V. (Student Forum within the Tönissteiner Kreis e. V.) that is part of a European and worldwide network of student organizations, the Politeia Community.

===Indonesia===
Student societies in Indonesia play a very important role since freedom struggle (before 1945), such as [[Budi Oetomo]], Islamic Students of Indonesia (PII), and after freedom struggle like [[Muhammadiyah Student Association]] (IPM).

===Ireland===
Student societies are widespread in Ireland's universities, with a wide range of activities catered for, including debating, performing arts, role-play, faculty-based activities, gaming, political activity etc.  The range of support for societies varies from university to university, though all universities provide funding and facilities to some extent for societies.

Student societies are usually governed by Officers and a Committee with an "Auditor" at its head. The [[Biological Society]], [[RCSI]]'s main student society, is purportedly the oldest student medical society in the world. However, it is [[Trinity College, Dublin]] which is the location of [[College Historical Society]] (1770) and the [[University Philosophical Society]] (1853), the two oldest student societies in the world. The [[Literary and Debating Society (NUI Galway)]] also has the distinction for being the first known student society in the world to elect a female leader, with the election of Clare F. Fitzgerald as "Auditor" in 1942.

Examples include:
* [[College Historical Society]]
* [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]]
* [[Biological Society|RCSI Biological Society]]
* [[The Law Society (University College Dublin)]]
* [[Literary and Debating Society (NUI Galway)]]
* [[UCC Philosophical Society]]
* [[UCD Dramsoc]]
* [[University College Dublin Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[University Philosophical Society]]

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], there are different forms of student societies. Originally there was just the ''Corps'' (for corpus studiosorum), student bodies, starting with the Groninger Studenten Corps ''[[Vindicat atque Polit]]'' in the city of Groningen on 4 February 1815, as a part of the governing of the [[education]] on the [[universities]] and to give students the opportunity to develop themselves in all fields of life. On the wave of [[catholic emancipation]] starting in the 1890s, small groups of students, gathered around local [[priests]], split off from the [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[secular]] (in name anyway) corps fraternities to form their own societies focused on the [[catholic]] [[religion]]. This started the formation of many other religious societies in the different university cities. In the second half of the 20th century the Catholic split-offs formed an intercity-connection; the {{Interlanguage link multi|Aller Heiligen Convent|nl}} and the focus on the religion was lost or abandoned.

These societies are now known as ''student associations'' in the Netherlands, aimed mostly at social relations and [[gezelligheid]]. Most of the corpora now reside in older buildings in the city center, retaining mostly a rather traditional and conservative image. These organizations offer students a wide range of sports, cultural activities ranging from all levels of sports like [[field hockey]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] to extremes like [[kitesurfing]], [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]]-flying, all for student-friendly prices and development aid organisations and encouragement to start a new club of some sort at all times.

The 20th century also saw, especially in the 1960s, the formation of more independent societies at the universities itself, partly as a reaction against the elite status of the corps, abolishing [[hazing]] and religious links and some even opening up to non-students. These non-Corps student societies are known as ''study associations'' (aimed at extracurricular activities for students, such as study trips, lectures, parties or drinks) or are general associations, for sports, literature, arts, etc., founded at the university itself.

===Norway===
The tradition with student societies in Norway reaches back to 1813, when [[Norwegian Students' Society]] in Oslo was founded. The major student societies in Norway are those in [[Oslo]], [[Trondheim]] and [[Bergen]]. The societies in Oslo and Trondheim operates the student houses, and do also have subgroups who are engaged in theatre, political debates, radio, TV and newspaper. [[Studentersamfunnet i Bergen|Bergen Student Society]] are not in charge of the city's student house, but are arranging political debates, lectures and cultural discussions at [[Det Akademiske Kvarter]].

A Norwegian tradition is to appoint an animal as the high protector or majesty of the student societies, such as ''His Majesty the Golden Pig'' (Oslo), ''The Black Sheep'' (Trondheim) and [[Hans Majestet Pinnsvinet|His Majesty the Hedgehog]] (Bergen). The zoological Majesties have their own order of honours, awarded to members of the student societies and member of the academic staff at the institutions, as well as visiting members of the Norwegian royal family.

===Sweden===
Student leisure activities in Sweden are usually organised by the [[students' union]]s (''studentkårer'', ''studentkår'' in singular). Swedish student unions cover the whole area from arranging most of the big parties, cultural activities and sports event, to acting as an equivalent of [[trade union]] for the students so their voices can be heard regarding the content and forms of education. The union is usually divided in smaller parts called sections, ''sektioner'', according to what subjects of programs the students study. Generally all kinds of smaller societies, political, religious or just dealing with different kinds of hobbies, are organised within the students' union rather than as separate units.

An exception to this are the two ancient universities in [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] and [[Lund University|Lund]]. There, most activities except "trade union" issues are organised by the '''[[Nations at Swedish universities|student nations]]''', the oldest student societies in Sweden,  now thirteen at each university. The Uppsala nations have a history stretching back to ca 1630–1640, and were likely formed under the influence of the ''[[Landsmannschaft]]en'' in existence at the northern German universities frequented by Swedish students. The nations in Lund were formed at the time of the foundation of the university (1666) or shortly thereafter. The nations take the names from the [[Provinces of Sweden|Swedish provinces]] from which they traditionally recruited their members, but do not always adhere to the strict practice of limiting membership according to those principles.

=== Uzbekistan ===
As a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Union state, [[Uzbekistan]] holding some of the best Universities in Central Asia. First universities established back in 1920s at Turkestan Socialist Republic.Today many of these universities have their own student societies.These societies providing information and support for students who wants to study abroad at [[Tashkent]].

=== United Kingdom ===
The U.K. universities boast many notable societies, most of them organised through the universities' Student Unions. These societies encompass a wide range of topics, from course-specific societies, sport societies, film or tv show societies and business societies. For example, the University of Warwick's biggest society is the Warwick Business School Society (WBSS), that possesses more than 4,000 members and organises 30+ events each year around the themes of business and is led by President and Vice-President, Petra Ghamlouch and Luca Dugaro.

===United States===
Many student societies in the US are focused on the interests of the student members, whether it involves [[community service]], the ethnicity of the members (such as a Black Student Union or [[Hillel International|Hillel]]), their religion or [[Irreligion|lack of religion]] (such as the [[Secular Student Alliance]]), or their political interests (such as [[College Republicans]]). Others focus on a specific social cause, whether by topic or specific to an area (even international). For example, [[Refresh Bolivia]] is a student-run nonprofit community which originated at [[Harvard University]]; it is dedicated to constructing a "maternal &amp; child care oriented community health center" in [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teams - New Venture Competition |publisher= [[Harvard Business School]] |url=http://www.hbs.edu/newventurecompetition/social-enterprise-track/Pages/teams.aspx| website= HBS.edu|accessdate=9 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809192819/http://www.hbs.edu/newventurecompetition/social-enterprise-track/Pages/teams.aspx| archivedate= 10 August 2017| language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the term "super senior" in [[finance]], see [[Senior debt#Super-senior status]].''

A '''super senior''' is a student in an American four-year educational institution such as a [[high school]] or [[university]] who has been attending the institution for 5 or more years or has more than the usual number of credits required to graduate without achieving a [[diploma]] or [[bachelor's degree]].

==Causes==
Applied to education in the [[United States]], super-seniors usually have the minimum number of credits to graduate but do not for various reasons. These students will advance through the grades (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) on schedule and are classified as a "senior" for two or more years.

===Redshirt student-athlete===
A student-athlete may have been made a [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] their freshman year, which delays their four-year eligibility for competition in the NCAA until their sophomore year. As a result, they will still be eligible the year after their senior year and may stay in college to continue competition.

===Multiple degrees===
Students who intend to complete two or more degrees at the same time are often required to earn approximately 140-150 credits to receive their degrees, rather than the normal 120. It is often in the student's best interest to earn all desired/required undergraduate degrees at the same time as [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] is more readily available to undergraduates than to graduates returning for additional undergraduate degrees. They could also use summer school sessions as well.

===Change of majors===
Students may choose to change majors after they are well advanced in their schooling. These students often have enough [[Curriculum#Higher education|general education]] credits and overall credits to graduate but do not have their major-specific credits completed.

===Leave of absence===
Students may take a leave of absence from their university for the difficult circumstances described below, or to pursue other endeavors, such as living, working, or studying abroad, tending to a fledgling business, or pursuing opportunities in their chosen career. [[Stanford University]] in particular is known for its sizable constituency of fifth-year (and sometimes even sixth-year) seniors who took time off to volunteer or work overseas. Many of Stanford's more famous alumni have taken a leave of absence and never returned to the school.

Another school well known in this regard is [[Brigham Young University]], the flagship school of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Many male BYU students, both at the main campus in Utah and at its branch campuses in [[Brigham Young University–Hawaii|Hawaii]] and [[Brigham Young University–Idaho|Idaho]], take two years off during their studies to go on [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missions]]. Before a 2012 change in church policy, female students were much less likely to take time off to serve missions (which, for women, last 18 months). Under the old policy, men were allowed to serve at age 19, while women had to wait until 21 (by which time many would be close to finishing degrees, married, or both). With the new policy, males can go on missions immediately after high school as long as they are at least 18, while females can serve once they turn 19.

===Poor choice of classes===
Super-seniors often include students who chose their classes without considering graduation requirements. They are often missing important requirements for their major or core/general education. Additionally, in changing of majors this creates an important concept in core classes as well as other classes in the curriculum.

===Music majors===
For music majors, participation in music ensembles is an obvious requirement over the course of their college career.  At many colleges, large ensembles (full choir, concert/marching/jazz band, and/or symphony orchestra) rehearse four hours a week for only one credit (typically, the number of credits correspond to hours spent in class per week).  This is to encourage non-music majors to be in the ensembles; however, it is not unusual for music majors to carry 8 classes in a semester for a normal credit load of 15-16 credits. Due to this more intense time commitment, music majors often have to take 2 or more semesters to complete their graduation requirements.

===Low grades===
In many schools, the grade of "D" is enough to receive credit for a class, but not high enough to count towards the student's major or core/general education requirements. A student who receives too many D grades may have enough credits to graduate but not good enough grades.

===Desire to remain in school===
Some super-seniors have enough credits and requirements to graduate, but do not apply for graduation. In most cases, universities do not automatically grant graduation without application, and as long as tuition is paid, students are not forced to leave the school. This is normally not applicable to high school.

Some super-seniors may be in their fifth or later year in the school but do not have enough credits to graduate. These students appear on paper as juniors or (simple) seniors and do not have enough credits to graduate with their peers.

Some super-seniors take a leave of absence or extra majors on purpose to remain in school for as long as possible.

Another example of a student’s desire to remain in school is if the student is an accounting major intending to sit for the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]].  Most states in the U.S. require CPA candidates to obtain at least 150 semester hours of college education.  One way for a student to obtain the 150 semester hours required for the CPA Exam is to take additional accounting or business courses in the student’s fifth or subsequent years without having to enroll in a postgraduate program.

===Difficult or multiple majors===
Students in high-stress majors such as [[mathematics]] or those who take a difficult double-major (within the same degree) or minor may choose to take a minimum number of classes (two, three, or four depending on the number of credits offered per class) at one time in order to achieve higher grades or superior retention.

===Difficult circumstances===
Occasionally a student becomes ill or is injured in mid-semester and cannot complete/pass the classes he/she has begun. If this occurs after the drop-deadline, the school may make a judgment as to whether to count the grades against him/her or drop the student from the semester. In either case, the student would need an additional semester to graduate.

Students may have other difficulties that prevent them from completing the graduation requirements in the traditional four years, such as raising a child or being required to work full-time. Such students may only attend classes on a part-time basis, taking over a decade to complete a bachelor's degree.

===Failing grades===
Occasionally a student may keep his or her [[grade point average]] high enough to remain in school but still fail enough classes that they do not have enough credits to graduate at the end of his or her four years.

===College Required Classes===
Many times, universities will require classes in order to graduate that fall under the "General Education Requirements" category. Often, universities will offer some of these classes (especially at smaller universities where number of teachers or resources are more limited)  only once every few semesters. In some cases, students find it impossible (due to other courses, employment, or other reasons) to take these courses when they are offered and sometimes need to stay enrolled in the university for an extra semester or year until these classes are offered again.

===Take Five Scholars Program===
At the [[University of Rochester]], students are given the unique opportunity to partake in the Take Five Scholars Program. In this program, the student receives a fifth year, or one additional semester, tuition free while the student studies a subject outside of their major. The student has to apply for this program before their eighth semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Take Five Scholars Program : Center for Academic Support|url=http://www.rochester.edu/college/CCAS/TakeFive/ |work= |publisher=[[University of Rochester]] |date= |accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agnes Scott College]] also offers a Fifth Year program, tuition-free. It is typically used to take courses that interest them but they could not take during their first four years, to finish a second major, or to take classes that are prerequisites for a graduate program they wish to pursue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post-Baccalaureate Program|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/Media/Website%20Resources/pdf/academics/catalog/post-baccalaureateprograms.pdf|publisher=Agnes Scott College|accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperative Education===
Many colleges and universities offer a [[Cooperative Education]] program.  In this program, a student has the opportunity to integrate work experience into his/her education through [[full-time]] employment during one or more semesters.  Generally, a student will not enroll in any courses during the semester(s) of his/her full-time employment.  Therefore, a student participating in Cooperative Education will require more than four years to complete his/her studies.

===Wait-Listed===
Students are wait-listed when applying for college entrance or when enrolling in classes at their college or university. A spot on a wait-list delays students that are earning credits for core/general education or toward their major. Being wait-listed at the beginning of their college career or at any point during their time at a college or university prevents them from having enough credits to graduate in the traditional four years.

===Transfer students===
Transfer students may have to spend a longer time getting their degrees since different universities have different requirements.  Also, students may transfer to narrow down their major to a specific one; an engineering student at one school may want to transfer to another one to major in a specific type of engineering, for example.

==Effects==

===College or university===
Some universities reduce or withdraw state funding after a student's fifth year.  In addition, parents who are paying for their children's education and living expenses may lose patience and cut their student's funding. Fifth year students are becoming more common as students increasingly choose to progress through difficult courses of study slow paces or pursue multiple majors or degrees. Although States often reduce or withdraw funding, there is still funding available to the students in the form of scholarships, as well as federal money such as work study and student loans.

===High school===
Public high schools may allow a fifth year super-senior who does not have enough credits to graduate to continue attending their regular school, though students older than age 19 are usually required to attend "continuation school" meant for adults who have not graduated with a high school degree. Students forced into continuation school often choose to drop-out or take the [[General Educational Development|GED]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Special education==
In the United States, federal law ([[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]]) states that public (state) schools are required to keep special-needs students in regular public schools (or a [[special education]] school if the student's [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]] warrants it) until they graduate from that school or reach the age of 21.

'''Takadimi''' is a system devised by Richard Hoffman, William Pelto, and John W. White in 1996 in order to teach rhythm skills. Takadimi, while utilizing rhythmic symbols borrowed from classical [[South India]]n [[carnatic music]], differentiates itself from this method by focusing the syllables on meter and on western tonal rhythm. Takadimi is based on the use of specific syllables at certain places within a beat.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Richard|author2=William Pelto |author3=John. W. White |title=Takadimi: A Beat-Oriented System of Rhythm Pedagogy|journal=Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy|year=1996|volume=10|pages=7–30|url=http://www.sudburydrums.com/uploads/5/8/0/1/5801637/takadimiarticle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Takadimi is used in classrooms from elementary level up through the collegiate level, and it meets National Content Standard 5 by teaching both reading and notating music.&lt;ref name="Music Educators Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ester|first=Don P.|author2=John W. Scheib |author3=Kimberly J. Inks |title=Takadimi: A Rhythm System for all Ages|journal=Music Educators Journal|date=November 2006|volume=93|pages=60–65|jstor=3878473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Takadimi is similar to the [[Kodály Method]], developed in 1935 in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/permalink/meta-dc-4218:1 University of North Texas Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;
Both systems can be traced back to the 19th century French Time-Names system.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;  Hoffman, Pelto, and White developed the system with certain goals in mind. As stated by the developers themselves:
#It should lead to accuracy and musicality in performance, both studies and sight-read, including the ability to recognize and perform musical gesture.
#It should require and reflect an understanding of rhythmic structure, recognition of metric and rhythmic interaction, and an awareness of precise contextual location of beats and attack points.
#It should facilitate aural recognition and identification of rhythmic patterns and metric divisions.
#It should provide a precise and consistent language for the discussion of temporal phenomena. There should be no need to create new terms or separate categories for performance, transcription, or analytical work.
#It should address rhythmic issues presented by music outside the realm of traditional tonal literature such as asymmetric meters, modulation of meter or tempo, complex syncopations, complex tuplet groupings, and passages that combine these in novel and challenging ways.
#Like pitch solfège, it should be a system that is easily applied and adapts to broad applications, and it should be a tool for lifelong use.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;
Hoffman, Pelto, and White believe that they took the best from many existing systems and tweaked them together to form this system that best meets the goals they set for themselves. Of the systems they used as either inspiration or examples of unwanted attributes, three are mentioned in the journal where they first proposed their system in 1996: The [[Kodály Method]], the McHose/Tibbs system, and Edwin Gordon's system.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;

==How it works==

The Takadimi system teaches students to read rhythm in a way similar to the way a language would be taught,&lt;ref name="Progressive Sight Singing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krueger|first=Carol|title=Progressive Sight Singing|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; rooted in [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzian]] theory formalized by [[Robert M. Gagné]] and applied in Edwin Gordon's [[Gordon Music Learning Theory#Skill Learning Sequences|skill learning sequences]].&lt;ref name="Music Educators Journal"/&gt; Students learn first to recognize and repeat rhythms before they learn to associate those rhythms with standard musical notation and begin reading and writing music. The system has a basis of two related sets of syllables, one for simple meter and one for compound meter. In both meters, syllables are assigned to certain positions within the beat as opposed to the syllables being assigned to certain notational values.This allows for rhythms that sound the same to be pronounced the same, even when the notation differs. Such notational differences that commonly result in rhythms that sound the same often occur between 2/4 and 2/2 time signatures. Also, each subdivision has unique syllables, so a note in a certain place within the beat always has the same syllable.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt; 
[[File:Takadimi Syllables.png|thumb|right|Divisions of Takadimi Syllables]]

===Simple meter===
In simple meter, the attack on the beat is called ‘ta,’ and an attack on the second half of the beat is always called ‘di.’ When the beat is divided further into fourths, pronunciation of each fourth would be ‘ta ka di mi.’&lt;ref name=Takadimi.net&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Richard|title=Learning Rhythm with the Takadimi System of Rhythm Solfege|url=http://www.takadimi.net/documents/Takadimi%20short%20guide%20for%20Web.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound meter===
In compound meter, as in simple meter, the attack on the beat is called ‘ta.’ The first division into thirds is pronounced ‘ta ki da.’ The subdivision into sixths is pronounced ‘ta va ki di da ma.’&lt;ref name=Takadimi.net /&gt;

===Both meters===
In both meters, ‘ta’ always begins a beat and ‘di’ always marks the middle of the beat, simplifying switching between the two. Also, in order to allow the system to expand to more unusual time signatures, a syllable ‘ti’ may be added to the end of the subdivision. A quintuplet in simple meter, for example, would be pronounced ‘ta ka di mi ti,’ and a septuplet in compound meter would be pronounced ‘ta va ki di da ma ti.’&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;

==Comparison to other systems==

===Kodály Method===
The system developed by Hungarian composer [[Zoltán Kodály]] differs from Takadimi in that is ascribes syllables to specific notational values, regardless of their placement within the beat.  Sets of syllables are also assigned to specific rhythmic patterns. For example, an eighth note is called ‘ti’ whether it is on the attack of the beat or in the middle. It is also called ‘ti’ regardless of the meter.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;  This method was intended for use at the elementary level,&lt;ref name="The Kodaly Approach"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trinka|first=Jill|title=The Kodaly Approach|url=http://www.allianceamm.org/resources_elem_Kodaly.html|accessdate=3 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219100225/http://www.allianceamm.org/resources_elem_Kodaly.html|archivedate=19 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many critics say that it is not expandable to upper level classrooms. Philip Tacka and Michael Houlahan, experts who have studied [[Kodály]] at [[Millersville University]], have stated that “the Takadimi rhythm system solves the problems associated with the [[Kodály]] rhythm syllables. We believe that were [[Kodály]] alive today, he would certainly encourage his students and colleagues to use the Takadimi system.”&lt;ref name="Music Educators Journal" /&gt;  Lois Chosky has proposed modifications to this method that provide for further subdivisions of syllables in The Kodály Context: Creating an Environment for Musical Learning.&lt;ref name=Chosky&gt;{{cite book|last=Chosky|first=Lois|title=The Kodály Context: Creating an Environment for Musical Learning|year=1981|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McHose/Tibbs===
Allen McHose and Ruth Tibbs developed a system that is based on counting within the measure. For example, ‘one’ is said on the attack of beat one, ‘two’ is said on the attack of beat two and so on. This system also ascribes syllables to certain notational values, but the syllables are not unique to certain attack points as in the Takadimi system.  Hoffman believes that this system requires a formal understanding of musical notation before it can become useful.&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;

===Edwin Gordon===
[[Gordon music learning theory|Edwin Gordon]] has developed a system similar to the McHose/Tibbs system above. It is similar in that it also assigns syllables based on beat orientation. However, these syllables are meter-dependent. For example, 3 eighth notes in 6/8 are pronounced ‘du-da-di’ whereas in 7/8 they are pronounced ‘du-ba-bi.’&lt;ref name="Richard Hoffman" /&gt;

'''Taproot Theatre Company''' (TTC) is a professional, non-profit [[theatre company]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], with a multi-faceted production program. Founded in 1976, Taproot Theatre has mainstage productions, at its location in the [[Greenwood, Seattle|Greenwood]] neighborhood, touring productions through the [[Pacific Northwest]], and theatrical training through its acting studio. Taproot Theatre Company is a member of [[Theatre Communications Group]] (TCG), Theatre Puget Sound (TPS), and the [[Greenwood, Seattle|Greenwood]]-[[Phinney Ridge, Seattle|Phinney]] Chamber of Commerce.

== Mainstage ==
Taproot Theatre produces five plays each year for its Mainstage season, plus an annual holiday production. Play selection includes classics, world premieres, musicals, dramas and comedies. Each Mainstage production offers one pay-what-you-can performance. TTC reaches approximately 30,000 audience members each year through more than 150 performances.

In addition to its regular performances, Taproot hosts matinees targeted to specific audience, either students or seniors. Each student matinee includes a post-show talk-back with the actors and director. For some students, it is the first time they have seen a professional production.

== Acting Studio ==
Taproot’s Acting Studio was founded in 1992 to provide affordable, encouraging and artistically challenging classes for children and adults interested in learning the craft of acting. In the years since then, TTC has expanded the program to offer year-round classes in dozens of subjects including [[musical theatre]], on-camera acting, and [[Shakespeare]].

== Touring ==
Taproot Theatre Company began as a touring company in 1976, performing throughout Washington State at schools, prisons, churches and community centers. Today, Taproot’s Road Company spends the school year using theatre to teach social-issue lessons such as bullying and harassment prevention to schools in Seattle and throughout the Pacific Northwest; this program began in 1985. Each summer, Taproot assembles a Road Company of five professional actors to present a three-play repertoire of social-issue plays to school populations. The cast engage with the students after each performance through interactive talk-back sessions and classrooms discussions.As of early 2008, over 1 million students have seen Taproot’s social-issue plays. Plays in this program are written by Northwest playwrights and incorporate principles from [[Committee for Children]]’s Steps to Respect and Second Step curricula. During the 2008/2009 school year, Taproot’s Road Company introduced a new play, ''New Girl'' by Josh Hornbeck, about [[Cyber-bullying|cyber bullying]].

TTC also mounts touring productions for the church and corporate communities. The company’s [[Improvisational comedy|improv comedy]] troupe tours as well.

== Vocational school in Indonesia ==
Vocational school in Indonesia could be considered as high school with special focused courses. Because, in Indonesian vocational school, they still have the same must-learned subjects with the general high school. So, that is why some vocational school could have opportunity to continue their study to the college.

== History ==
Telkom Vocational School Medan  was established in 1992, with the name of '''SMK Telkom Sandhy Putra Medan''' (Indonesian) and "Sandhy Putra Telecommunication Vocational School" (English). This school become the first vocational school in Indonesia which held a vocational education in the field of Telecommunication Engineering Program. Established by Telkom Sandhykara Putra Foundation whose owned by Indonesian Telecommunication Company, [[Telkom Indonesia]]. Telkom Sandhy Putra Vocational School Medan also simultaneously established in another city. Such as [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Malang]], [[Purwekerto]] and Banjarbaru.

'''Télécom ParisTech''' (also known as '''ENST''' or '''Télécom''' or '''École nationale supérieure des télécommunications''') is one of the top French public institutions of higher education and research ([[grandes écoles|Grandes Écoles]]) of engineering in France. Located in [[Paris]], it is also a member of the [[ParisTech]] Group and the [[Institut Télécom|Institut Telecom]].

In 1991, Télécom ParisTech and the [[EPFL]] collaborated and established a school named [[EURECOM]] located in [[Sophia-Antipolis]]. Students can now be admitted in two different curriculums, located either in the Paris or the Sophia-Antipolis campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/enseignement/cursus.html|title = Les cursus de la formation d'ingénieur|date = |accessdate = |website = Télécom ParisTech|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

*In 1845, Alphonse Foy, director of telegraphic lines, proposed a school specializing in telegraphy for Polytechnicians. His proposition was rejected.
*The school was founded on 12 July 1878 as the École professionnelle supérieure des postes et télégraphes (EPSPT).
*In 1912 the school's name was changed to École supérieure des postes et télégraphes (ESPT).
*In 1934 the ESPT moved to rue Barrault, in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]].
*In 1938 the school was renamed École nationale supérieure des postes, télégraphes et téléphones (ENSPTT), and in the same year, the [[President of France]], [[Albert Lebrun]] honored the school [[Legion of Honor]].
*During the [[Second World War]], in 1942, the school was divided into two schools: the ENSPTT and École nationale supérieure des télécommunications (ENST). The ENSPTT was closed on 31 December 2002.
*In 1971 the ENST passed under the direct guardianship of the ''Direction générale des télécommunications'', and the development of telecommunications during this period drove the state to create two associate schools: the [[ENST Bretagne]] in 1977 in [[Brest, France|Brest]], and the [[Telecom &amp; Management SudParis|INT]] in 1979 at [[Évry, Essonne|Évry]].
*In 1992 the ENST, together with the [[EPFL]], founded the [[EURECOM]] at [[Sophia-Antipolis]].
*On 26 December 1996 the [[Groupe des Écoles des Télécommunications]] (GET) was established. It consists of a group of telecommunications schools including the ENST, the [[ENST Bretagne|Telecom Bretagne]], the [[Telecom SudParis]], and [[EURECOM]].
*On 21 September 2009, the school's name was changed to Télécom ParisTech.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000021059936 Décret n° 2009-1136 du 21 septembre 2009 relatif à l'Institut Télécom]. Legifrance. Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
There are two ways to get admitted into Télécom ParisTech as an undergraduate student:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usine-digitale.fr/article/telecom-paristech-les-telecoms-en-heritage-le-web-en-destinee.N239204|title = Admission Process|date = |accessdate = |website = L'Usine Nouvelle|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Through a selective entrance examination ([[:fr:Concours commun Mines-Ponts|Concours Commun Mines Ponts]]) after at least two years of preparation in [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|Classes préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles]] curriculum following high school
* Through an application-based admission process for university students
** After a scientific bachelor's degree (Mathematics, Physics, Mechanics, Computer science etc.)
** After a [[:fr:Diplôme universitaire de technologie|DUT]] degree from a French university of technology
University students can also get admitted into Télécom ParisTech's [[Master of Science]] (MSc.) programme through an application-based admission process for university students from all over the world.

Télécom ParisTech is also one of the approved application schools for the [[École Polytechnique]], making it possible for fourth-year students to complete their studies with a one-year specialization at Télécom ParisTech. Télécom ParisTech also provides education for the [[Corps des télécommunications]].

Around 250 engineers graduate each year from Télécom ParisTech. Thirty to thirty-five percent of the graduates are foreign students coming from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/palmares-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs/telecom-paristech.html|title = Palmarès des Écoles d'ingénieurs|date = |accessdate = |website = L'Étudiant|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialization courses cover all aspects of computer science and communication engineering: Electronics, Signal processing, Software engineering, Networking, Economics, Finance etc.

==Research at Télécom ParisTech==
Research at Télécom ParisTech consists of:

*Optimization and transmission of information
*Improvements in Data processing
*Microelectronics, such as FPGA and DSP systems
*Image and Signal processing, wavelets
*Artificial intelligence, data mining, distributed and real-time systems
*User experience Design, Information visualisation and computer human interfaces

Télécom ParisTech has four research laboratories:

*The Department of Electronics and Communications: This laboratory consists of about one hundred researchers and teaching researchers (37 tenured) within 7 research groups
*The Department of Computer Science and Networking
*The Department of Signal and Image Processing
*The Department of Economic and Social Sciences

These departments are associated with the [[CNRS]] through the "Laboratory of the Communication and Processing of Information" and the "Interdisciplinary Institute for Innovation".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-3.fr/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training for engineering degrees==
*'''First year - Multidisciplinary studies'''
For undergraduate students, the core curriculum, commonly referred to as ''tronc commun,'' consists of courses in most areas of science (Mathematics, Economics, applied Mathematics, Computer science, Physics, etc.), as well as compulsory courses in the humanities (foreign languages, social sciences, liberal arts, etc.)

Taking place in the Paris campus of Télécom ParisTech, this primary year of multidisciplinary studies is common to both Paris curriculum students and Sophia-Antipolis curriculum students; and is followed by a one or two month mandatory summer internship. 
*'''Second and Third Year - Specialization in Paris or at Sophia-Antipolis (at [[EURECOM]])''' 
Starting from their second year, students have to choose a specialization in which they'll receive in-depth courses and that will conclude their engineering curriculum. Based on 13 specialization tracks more than 120 courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/enseignement/cursus/cycle-master-cursus-paris.html|title = Cycle Master: Campus Paris|date = |accessdate = |website = Télécom ParisTech|publisher = |last = |first = |language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; these two years eventually unfold into a six-month internship through which the engineering student will acquire their first real professional experience.

Third year students can also choose to complete their studies in an approved university in France or abroad, as part of a Double-Degree or a Master of Science program.

The '''University of the West Indies Museum''', commonly called the '''UWI Museum''', was established in 2012. Its focus is the history and development of the [[University of the West Indies]], and its relationship to the [[West Indies]] – now more commonly known as the [[Caribbean]] – region, which it serves. The university was itself established in the late 1940s, based on recommendations from the Irvine Committee of the British Asquith Commission on Higher Education in the Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the West Indies Committee of the Commission on Higher Education in the Colonies'', Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty June 1945. London, His Majesty’s Stationery Office&lt;/ref&gt;  Then called the [[University College of the West Indies]] (UCWI), the new West Indian university took its first students in October 1948 – 33 young men and women from across the region, hoping to swell the number of doctors available to the region’s people.&lt;ref&gt;''Origins: The Roots &amp; Symbols of the UWI'', Exhibition, UWI Museum, Mona, Jamaica&lt;/ref&gt;

The UWI Museum has made the UWI’s Origins the focus of its first semi-permanent exhibition, but also presents cameo exhibitions on other relevant topics. These have included academic dress and the relationship of Caribbean people to regionalism. The museum was established under the auspices of the UWI’s Vice Chancellor, its highest-ranking administrator, and is located in the UWI Regional Headquarters building at Mona, Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;'UWI Museum – An idea whose time has come', ''UWI Connect'', June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2620">'''Virtual mobility''' refers to students and teachers in [[higher education]] using another institution outside their own country to study or teach for a limited time, without physically leaving their home. It complements physical mobility in which students travel to [[study abroad]], such as within the [[Erasmus Programme]]. The two forms of mobility together constitute [[academic mobility]]. Student and teacher mobility are perceived as important quality issues in higher education.&lt;ref name="Van Damme citation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damme|first=Dirk Van|title=Quality issues in the internationalisation of higher education|journal=Higher Education|date=1 January 2001|year=2002|volume=41|issue=4|pages=415–441|doi=10.1023/A:1017598422297|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h1655n7084776473/|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rizvi|first=Fazal|author2=Lingard, Bob |title=GLOBALIZATION AND EDUCATION: COMPLEXITIES AND CONTINGENCIES|journal=Educational Theory|date=1 December 2000|volume=50|issue=4|pages=419–426|doi=10.1111/j.1741-5446.2000.00419.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual mobility has been defined as an activity that offers access to courses and study schemes in a foreign country and allows for communication activities with teachers and fellow students abroad via the new [[Information technology|information and communication technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Institutional transformation through best practices in virtual campus development : advancing E-learning policies|year=2009|publisher=Information Science Reference|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=978-1-60566-358-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmWdLAGnttcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Stansfield, M. |editor2=Connolly, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Striving for a European educational space, the European ministers of Education consider virtual mobility as a necessary addition to the traditional ways of studying abroad, that required travelling. In Europe, databases like Educontact provide students with an overview of available courses.

The public policy background is to be found, e.g. in the Leuven-declaration on Mobility, by 46 European Higher education ministers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurashe.eu/FileLib/Leuven_Louvain-la-Neuve_Communiqu9_April_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[non-commercial]] guide to virtual mobility is suitable for universities and schools that start with virtual mobility.&lt;ref&gt;http://145.20.178.4/Portals/0/documents/The_Guide_to_Virtual_Mobility.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Radio Day''' is an observance day held annually on 13 February to celebrate radio as a medium[https://www.un.org/en/sections/observances/international-days/]. It was proclaimed on 3 November 2011 by [[UNESCO]]'s 36th General Conference after originally being proposed by the [[Kingdom of Spain]].

==Background==

Following a request from the [[Academia Española de la Radio|Spanish Radio Academy]] on 20 September 2010, Spain proposed that the UNESCO Executive Board include an agenda item on the proclamation of a World Radio Day. UNESCO's Executive Board approved the agenda item in its provisional agenda for the proclamation of a "World Radio Day" on 29 September 2011. UNESCO carried out a wide consultation in 2011 with diverse stakeholders, such as broadcasting associations, UN agencies, funds and programmes, relevant NGOs, foundations and bilateral development agencies, as well as UNESCO Permanent Delegations and National Commissions for UNESCO. Among the answers, 91% were in favour of the project, including official support from the [[Arab States Broadcasting Union]] (ASBU), the [[Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union]] (ABU), the [[African Union of Broadcasting]] (AUB), the [[Caribbean Broadcasting Union]] (CBU), the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU), the International Association of Broadcasting (IAB), the [[North American Broadcasters Association]] (NABA), the Organización de Telecomunicaciones Ibeoramericanas (OTI), [[BBC News|BBC]], URTI, [[Vatican Radio]], etc. The results of this consultation are available in UNESCO's document 187 EX/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Session 187EX/13|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002112/211271e.pdf|work=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=26 Aug 2011|quote=The Director-General submits for the approval of the Executive Board, the feasibility study for the proclamation of a World Radio Day...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=13 February proposed as World Radio Day {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/all-news/news/13_february_proposed_as_world_radio_day/|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=UNESCO|date=10 Jul 2011|author=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board recommended to the UNESCO 36th session of the General Conference that it proclaim a World Radio Day at its 36th session, and that this day be celebrated by UNESCO on 13 February, the anniversary of the day that the United Nations established the [[United Nations Radio]] in 1946. It also invited all United Nations Member States, organizations of the United Nations system and other international and regional organizations, professional associations and broadcasting unions, as well as [[civil society]], including non-governmental organizations and individuals, to duly celebrate World Radio Day, in the way that each considers most adequate. The board further requested that UNESCO's Director-General bring the resolution to the attention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, so that World Radio Day could be endorsed by the General Assembly and celebrated by the whole system. The matter was subsequently treated by UNESCO's General Conference, which adopted resolution contained in the file 36 C/63. World Radio Day was thus unanimously proclaimed by all Member States of UNESCO in November 2011.

In December 2012, The General Assembly of the UN endorsed the proclamation of World Radio Day, thereby becoming a day to be celebrated by all UN agencies, funds and programmes and their partners. File

Various radio industry bodies around the world are supporting the initiative by encouraging stations in developed countries to assist those in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Radio Day: What will you be doing?|url=http://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/10664/|publisher=Radio Info|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=15 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At UNESCO, the consultation, proclamation and celebrations were handled by Mirta Lourenco, Chief of the Sector for Media Development.

==The first World Radio Day==
[[File:World Radio Day.png|thumb|Logo of the first World Radio Day]]
In honour of the first World Radio Day in 2012, [[Lifeline Energy]], FrontlineSMS, [[SOAS, University of London|SOAS Radio]] and [[Empowerhouse]] hosted a seminar in London. A variety of practitioners, academics and tools providers joined at the School of Oriental and African Studies to explore ways in which radio reaches even the most remote and vulnerable communities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Speakers included Guy Berger (Director for Freedom of Expression and Media Development at UNESCO), Dr Chege Githiora (Chairman of the Centre of African Studies at SOAS), Birgitte Jallov (Empowerhouse/ [[Panos Network|Panos London]]), Amy O'Donnell (FrontlineSMS:Radio), Carlos Chirinos (SOAS Radio), and Linje Manyozo (LSE).
