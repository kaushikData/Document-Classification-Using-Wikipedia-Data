      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7858">In [[classical mechanics]], '''action-angle coordinates''' are a set of [[canonical coordinates]] useful in solving many [[integrable system]]s. The method of action-angles is useful for obtaining the [[frequency|frequencies]] of oscillatory or rotational motion without solving the [[equations of motion]].  Action-angle coordinates are chiefly used when the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s are completely separable.  (Hence, the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] does not depend explicitly on time, i.e., the [[conservation of energy|energy is conserved]].) Action-angle variables define an '''invariant torus''', so called because holding the action constant defines the surface of a [[torus]], while the angle variables parameterize the coordinates on the torus.

The [[Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization]] conditions, used to develop quantum mechanics before the advent of [[Schrödinger equation#Particles as waves|wave mechanics]], state that the action must be an integral multiple of [[Planck's constant]]; similarly, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s insight into [[Einstein–Brillouin–Keller method|EBK quantization]] and the difficulty of quantizing non-integrable systems was expressed in terms of the invariant tori of action-angle coordinates.

Action-angle coordinates are also useful in [[perturbation theory]] of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], especially in determining [[adiabatic invariant]]s. One of the earliest results from [[chaos theory]], for the non-linear  perturbations of dynamical systems with a small number of degrees of freedom is the [[KAM theorem]], which states that the invariant tori are stable under small perturbations.

The use of action-angle variables was central to the solution of the [[Toda lattice]], and to the definition of [[Lax pairs]], or more generally, the idea of the [[isospectral]] evolution of  a system.

==Derivation==
Action angles result from a [[Canonical_transformation#Type_2_generating_function|type-2]] [[canonical transformation]] where the generating function is [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation|Hamilton's characteristic function]] &lt;math&gt;W(\mathbf{q})&lt;/math&gt; (''not'' Hamilton's principal function &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;).  Since the original Hamiltonian does not depend on time explicitly, the new Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;K(\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{J})&lt;/math&gt; is merely the old Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; expressed in terms of the new [[canonical coordinates]], which we denote as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; (the '''action angles''', which are the [[generalized coordinates]]) and their new generalized momenta &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;.  We will not need to solve here for the generating function &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; itself; instead, we will use it merely as a vehicle for relating the new and old [[canonical coordinates]].

Rather than defining the action angles &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; directly, we define instead their generalized momenta, which resemble the [[action (physics)|classical action]] for each original [[generalized coordinate]]

:&lt;math&gt;
J_{k} \equiv \oint p_k \, dq_k
&lt;/math&gt;

where the integration path is implicitly given by the constant energy function &lt;math&gt;E=E(q_k,p_k)&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the actual motion is not involved in this integration, these generalized momenta &lt;math&gt;J_k&lt;/math&gt; are constants of the motion, implying that the transformed Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the conjugate [[generalized coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} J_{k} = 0 = \frac{\partial K}{\partial w_k}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt; are given by the typical equation for a type-2 [[canonical transformation]]

:&lt;math&gt;
w_k \equiv \frac{\partial W}{\partial J_k}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the new Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;K=K(\mathbf{J})&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the new generalized momenta &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;.

The dynamics of the action angles is given by [[Hamilton's equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} w_k = \frac{\partial K}{\partial J_k} \equiv \nu_k(\mathbf{J})
&lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side is a constant of the motion (since all the &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;'s are).  Hence, the solution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
w_k = \nu_k(\mathbf{J}) t + \beta_k
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta_k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of integration.  In particular, if the original [[generalized coordinate]] undergoes an oscillation or rotation of period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding action angle &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt; changes by &lt;math&gt;\Delta w_k = \nu_k (\mathbf{J}) T&lt;/math&gt;.

These &lt;math&gt;\nu_k(\mathbf{J})&lt;/math&gt; are the frequencies of oscillation/rotation for the original [[generalized coordinate]]s &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt;.  To show this, we integrate the net change in the action angle &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt; over exactly one complete variation (i.e., oscillation or rotation) of its [[generalized coordinate]]s &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta w_k \equiv \oint \frac{\partial w_k}{\partial q_k} \, dq_k = 
\oint \frac{\partial^2 W}{\partial J_k \, \partial q_k} \, dq_k = 
\frac{d}{dJ_k} \oint \frac{\partial W}{\partial q_k} \, dq_k = 
\frac{d}{dJ_k} \oint p_k \, dq_k = \frac{dJ_k}{dJ_k} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

Setting the two expressions for &lt;math&gt;\Delta w_{k}&lt;/math&gt; equal, we obtain the desired equation

:&lt;math&gt; 
\nu_k(\mathbf{J}) = \frac{1}{T}
&lt;/math&gt;

The action angles &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; are an independent set of [[generalized coordinates]].  Thus, in the general case, each original generalized coordinate &lt;math&gt;q_{k}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a [[Fourier series]] in ''all'' the action angles

:&lt;math&gt;
q_k = \sum_{s_1=-\infty}^\infty \sum_{s_2 = -\infty}^\infty \cdots \sum_{s_N = -\infty}^\infty A^k_{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N} e^{i2\pi s_1 w_1} e^{i2\pi s_2 w_2} \cdots e^{i2\pi s_N w_N}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A^k_{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N}&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier series coefficient.  In most practical cases, however, an original generalized coordinate &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt; will be expressible as a [[Fourier series]] in only its own action angles &lt;math&gt;w_k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
q_k = \sum_{s_k=-\infty}^\infty A^k_{s_k} e^{i2\pi s_k w_k}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary of basic protocol==

The general procedure has three steps:

# Calculate the new generalized momenta &lt;math&gt;J_{k}&lt;/math&gt; 
# Express the original Hamiltonian entirely in terms of these variables.
# Take the derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to these momenta to obtain the frequencies &lt;math&gt;\nu_k&lt;/math&gt;

==Degeneracy==

In some cases, the frequencies of two different [[generalized coordinate]]s are identical, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\nu_k = \nu_l&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k \neq l&lt;/math&gt;.  In such cases, the motion is called '''degenerate'''.

Degenerate motion signals that there are additional general conserved quantities; for example, the frequencies of the [[Kepler problem]] are degenerate, corresponding to the conservation of the [[Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector]].

Degenerate motion also signals that the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]]s are completely separable in more than one coordinate system; for example, the Kepler problem is completely separable in both [[spherical coordinates]] and [[parabolic coordinates]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''additive polynomials''' are an important topic in  classical [[algebraic number theory]]. 

==Definition==
Let ''k'' be a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', with ''p'' a [[prime number]]. A [[polynomial]] ''P''(''x'') with coefficients in ''k'' is called an '''additive polynomial''', or a '''[[Frobenius endomorphism|Frobenius]] polynomial''', if 

:&lt;math&gt;P(a+b)=P(a)+P(b)\,&lt;/math&gt;

as polynomials in ''a'' and ''b''. It is equivalent to assume that this equality holds for all ''a'' and ''b'' in some infinite field containing ''k'', such as its algebraic closure. 

Occasionally '''absolutely additive''' is used for the condition above, and '''additive''' is used for the weaker condition that ''P''(''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'') = ''P''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''P''(''b'') for all ''a'' and ''b'' in the field. For infinite fields the conditions are equivalent, but for finite fields they are not, and the weaker condition is the "wrong" one and does not behave well. For example, over a field of order ''q'' any multiple ''P'' of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x'' will satisfy ''P''(''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'') = ''P''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''P''(''b'') for all ''a'' and ''b'' in the field, but will usually not be (absolutely) additive.

== Examples ==
The polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is additive. Indeed, for any ''a'' and ''b'' in the algebraic closure of ''k'' one has by the [[binomial theorem]]

:&lt;math&gt;(a+b)^p = \sum_{n=0}^p {p \choose n} a^n b^{p-n}.&lt;/math&gt;  

Since ''p'' is prime,  for all ''n'' = 1, ..., ''p''−1 the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{p \choose n}&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by ''p'', which implies that 

:&lt;math&gt;(a+b)^p \equiv a^p+b^p \mod p&lt;/math&gt; 

as polynomials in ''a'' and ''b''.

Similarly all the polynomials of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_p^n(x)=x^{p^n}&lt;/math&gt;

are additive, where ''n'' is a non-[[negative integer]].

The definition makes sense even if ''k'' is a field of characteristic zero, but in this case the only additive polynomials are those of the form ''ax'' for some ''a'' in ''k''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==The ring of additive polynomials==
It is quite easy to prove that any [[linear combination]] of polynomials &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\tau_p^n(x)&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in ''k'' is also an additive  polynomial. An interesting question is whether there are other additive  polynomials except these linear combinations. The answer is that these are the only ones.

One can check that if ''P''(''x'') and ''M''(''x'') are  additive polynomials, then so are ''P''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''M''(''x'') and ''P''(''M''(''x'')). These imply that the  additive polynomials form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] under polynomial addition and composition. This ring is denoted 

:&lt;math&gt;k\{ \tau_p\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This ring is not commutative unless ''k'' equals the field &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbb{F}_p=\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[modular arithmetic]]). Indeed, consider the additive polynomials ''ax'' and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; for a coefficient ''a'' in ''k''. For them to commute under composition, we must have

:&lt;math&gt;(ax)^p=ax^p,\,&lt;/math&gt;

or  ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a'' = 0.  This is false for ''a'' not a root of this equation, that is, for ''a'' outside &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbb{F}_p.&lt;/math&gt;

==The fundamental theorem of additive polynomials==
Let ''P''(''x'') be a polynomial with coefficients in ''k'', and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\{w_1,\dots,w_m\}\subset k&lt;/math&gt; be the set of its roots. Assuming that the roots of ''P''(''x'') are distinct (that is, ''P''(''x'') is [[separable polynomial|separable]]), then ''P''(''x'') is additive if and only if the set &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\{w_1,\dots,w_m\}&lt;/math&gt; forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with the field addition.

[[File:Aleph0.svg|thumb|right|150px|Aleph-naught, or aleph-null, the smallest infinite cardinal number]]

In [[mathematics]], and in particular [[set theory]], the '''aleph numbers''' are a sequence of numbers used to represent the [[cardinality]] (or size) of [[infinite set]]s that can be [[well-ordered]]. They are named after the symbol used to denote them, the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letter [[aleph]] (&lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt;) (though in older mathematics books the letter aleph is often printed upside down by accident,&lt;ref&gt;For example, in {{harv|Sierpiński|1958|loc=p.402}} the letter aleph appears both the right way up and upside down&lt;/ref&gt; partly because a [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]] matrix for aleph was mistakenly constructed the wrong way up).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mr=0553111

The cardinality of the [[natural number]]s is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (read ''aleph-naught'' or ''aleph-zero''; the German term ''aleph-null'' is also sometimes used), the next larger cardinality is aleph-one &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_2&lt;/math&gt; and so on. Continuing in this manner, it is possible to define a [[cardinal number]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for every [[ordinal number]] α, as described below.

The concept and notation are due to [[Georg Cantor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/set.html|title=Earliest Uses of Symbols of Set Theory and Logic|website=jeff560.tripod.com|access-date=2016-05-05|author=Jeff Miller}}  Miller quotes {{Cite book|title=Georg Cantor:His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite|author=Joseph Warren Dauben|date=1990|isbn=9780691024479}} : "His new numbers deserved something unique. ... Not wishing to invent a new symbol himself, he chose the aleph, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet...the aleph could be taken to represent new beginnings..."

&lt;/ref&gt; who defined the notion of cardinality and realized that [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|infinite sets can have different cardinalities]].

The aleph numbers differ from the [[Extended real number line|infinity]] (∞) commonly found in algebra and calculus. Alephs measure the sizes of sets; infinity, on the other hand, is commonly defined as an extreme [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the [[real number line]] (applied to a [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] that "[[divergent series|diverges]] to infinity" or "increases without bound"), or an extreme point of the [[extended real number line]].

=={{anchor|Aleph-null}}Aleph-naught==
&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (aleph-naught, also aleph-zero or the German term Aleph-null) is the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers, and is an [[transfinite number|infinite cardinal]]. The set of all finite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], called '''ω''' or '''ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''' (where ω is the lowercase Greek letter [[omega]]), has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. A set has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is [[countably infinite]], that is, there is a [[bijection]] (one-to-one correspondence) between it and the natural numbers. Examples of such sets are

* the set of all [[square number]]s, the set of all [[cubic number]]s, the set of all [[fourth power]]s, ...
* the set of all [[perfect power]]s, the set of all [[prime power]]s, 
* the set of all [[even number]]s, the set of all [[odd number]]s,
* the set of all [[prime number]]s, the set of all [[composite number]]s, 
* the set of all [[integer]]s, 
* the set of all [[rational number]]s, 
* the set of all [[constructible number]]s (in the geometric sense),
* the set of all [[algebraic number]]s, 
* the set of all [[computable number]]s, 
* the set of all [[definable number]]s, 
* the set of all binary [[string (computer science)|string]]s of finite length, and 
* the set of all finite [[subset]]s of any given countably infinite set.

These infinite ordinals: ω, ω+1, ω·2, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] are among the countably infinite sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Jech | first1=Thomas | title=Set Theory | publisher= [[Springer-Verlag]]| location=Berlin, New York | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sequence (with [[ordinality]] ω·2) of all positive odd integers followed by all positive even integers

:{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}

is an ordering of the set (with cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;) of positive integers.

If the [[axiom of countable choice]] (a weaker version of the [[axiom of choice]]) holds, then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than any other infinite cardinal.

==Aleph-one==
&lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of the set of all countable [[ordinal number]]s, called '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' or sometimes '''Ω'''. This '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is itself an ordinal number larger than all countable ones, so it is an [[uncountable set]]. Therefore,  &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is distinct from &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The definition of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; implies (in ZF, [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] ''without'' the axiom of choice) that no cardinal number is between &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;. If the [[axiom of choice]] is used, it can be further proved that the class of cardinal numbers is [[totally ordered]], and thus &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is the second-smallest infinite cardinal number. Using the axiom of choice we can show one of the most useful properties of the set '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''': any countable subset of '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' has an upper bound in '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  (This follows from the fact that the union of a countable number of countable sets is itself countable, one of the most common applications of the axiom of choice.)  This fact is analogous to the situation in &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;: every finite set of natural numbers has a maximum which is also a natural number, and [[Union (set theory)#Finite unions|finite unions]] of finite sets are finite.

'''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is actually a useful concept, if somewhat exotic-sounding. An example application is "closing" with respect to countable operations; e.g., trying to explicitly describe the [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] generated by an arbitrary collection of subsets (see e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[Borel hierarchy]]). This is harder than most explicit descriptions of "generation" in algebra ([[vector space]]s, [[group theory|group]]s, etc.) because in those cases we only have to close with respect to finite operations—sums, products, and the like. The process involves defining, for each countable ordinal, via [[transfinite induction]], a set by "throwing in" all possible countable unions and complements, and taking the union of all that over all of '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

Every uncountable [[coanalytic]] subset of a [[Polish space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has
cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Continuum hypothesis==
{{main|Continuum hypothesis}}
{{see also|Beth number}}
The [[cardinality]] of the set of [[real number]]s ([[cardinality of the continuum]]) is &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;. It cannot be determined from ZFC ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of choice]]) where this number fits exactly in the aleph number hierarchy, but it follows from ZFC that the continuum hypothesis, '''CH''', is equivalent to the identity

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuumHypothesis.html |title=Continuum Hypothesis|last=Szudzik |first=Mattew |date=31 July 2018 |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Web Resources |access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The CH states that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers. CH is independent of ZFC: it can be neither proven nor disproven within the context of that axiom system (provided that ZFC is [[consistency|consistent]]). That CH is consistent with ZFC was demonstrated by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1940 when he showed that its negation is not a theorem of ZFC.  That it is independent of ZFC was demonstrated by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] in 1963 when he showed, conversely, that the CH itself is not a theorem of ZFC by the (then novel) method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuumHypothesis.html |title=Continuum Hypothesis|last=Szudzik |first=Mattew |date=31 July 2018 |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Web Resources |access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aleph-ω==
Conventionally the smallest infinite ordinal is denoted ω, and the cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the least upper bound of
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\left\{\,\aleph_n : n\in\left\{\,0,1,2,\dots\,\right\}\,\right\}&lt;/math&gt;}}
among alephs.

Aleph-ω is the first uncountable cardinal number that can be demonstrated within Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ''not'' to be equal to the cardinality of the set of all [[real number]]s; for any positive integer ''n'' we can consistently assume that &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_n&lt;/math&gt;, and moreover it is possible to assume &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; is as large as we like. We are only forced to avoid setting it to certain special cardinals with [[cofinality]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, meaning there is an unbounded function from &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; to it (see [[Easton's theorem]]).

==Aleph-α for general α==
To define &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary ordinal number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, we must define the [[successor cardinal|successor cardinal operation]], which assigns to any cardinal number ρ the next larger [[well-order]]ed cardinal ρ{{sup|+}} (if the [[axiom of choice]] holds, this is the next larger cardinal).

We can then define the aleph numbers as follows:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{0} = \omega&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha+1} = \aleph_{\alpha}^+&lt;/math&gt;}}

and for λ, an infinite [[limit ordinal]],

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\lambda} = \bigcup_{\beta &lt; \lambda} \aleph_\beta.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The α-th infinite [[initial ordinal]] is written &lt;math&gt;\omega_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  Its cardinality is written &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
In ZFC, the '''aleph function''' &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection from the ordinals to the infinite cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{PlanetMath | urlname=AlephNumbers | title=aleph numbers | id=5710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed points of omega==
For any ordinal α we have
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\alpha\leq\omega_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;}}

In many cases &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is strictly greater than α. For example, for any successor ordinal α this holds. There are, however, some limit ordinals which are [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of the omega function, because of the [[fixed-point lemma for normal functions]]. The first such is the limit of the sequence

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\omega,\ \omega_\omega,\ \omega_{\omega_\omega},\ \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Any [[inaccessible cardinal|weakly inaccessible cardinal]] is also a fixed point of the aleph function.&lt;ref name="Harris 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kaharris.org/teaching/582/Lectures/lec31.pdf | title=Math 582 Intro to Set Theory, Lecture 31 | publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of Michigan | date=April 6, 2009 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Harris, Kenneth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be shown in ZFC as follows. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a weakly inaccessible cardinal. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; were a [[successor ordinal]], then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; would be a [[successor cardinal]] and hence not weakly inaccessible. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; were a [[limit ordinal]] less than &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt;, then its [[cofinality]] (and thus the cofinality of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) would be less than &lt;math&gt;\kappa &lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\kappa &lt;/math&gt; would not be regular and thus not weakly inaccessible. Thus &lt;math&gt;\lambda \geq \kappa &lt;/math&gt; and consequently &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \kappa &lt;/math&gt; which makes it a fixed point.

==Role of axiom of choice==

The cardinality of any infinite [[ordinal number]] is an aleph number. Every aleph is the cardinality of some ordinal. The least of these is its [[initial ordinal]]. Any set whose cardinality is an aleph is [[equinumerous]] with an ordinal and is thus [[Well-order|well-orderable]].

Each [[finite set]] is well-orderable, but does not have an aleph as its cardinality.

The assumption that the cardinality of each [[infinite set]] is an aleph number is equivalent over ZF to the existence of a well-ordering of every set, which in turn is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]]. ZFC set theory, which includes the axiom of choice, implies that every infinite set has an aleph number as its cardinality (i.e. is equinumerous with its initial ordinal), and thus the initial ordinals of the aleph numbers serve as a class of representatives for all possible infinite cardinal numbers.

When cardinality is studied in ZF without the axiom of choice, it is no longer possible to prove that each infinite set has some aleph number as its cardinality; the sets whose cardinality is an aleph number are exactly the infinite sets that can be well-ordered. The method of [[Scott's trick]] is sometimes used as an alternative way to construct representatives for cardinal numbers in the setting of ZF. For example, one can define card(''S'') to be the set of sets with the same cardinality as ''S'' of minimum possible rank. This has the property that card(''S'') = card(''T'') if and only if ''S'' and ''T'' have the same cardinality. (The set card(''S'') does not have the same cardinality of ''S'' in general, but all its elements do.)

In [[geometry]], an '''apeirogonal hosohedron''' or '''infinite hosohedron'''&lt;ref&gt;Conway (2008), p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; is a tiling of the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] consisting of two vertices at infinity. It may be considered an improper [[regular tiling]] of the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] plane, with [[Schläfli symbol]] {2,∞}.

==Related tilings and polyhedra==
The apeirogonal hosohedron is the arithmetic limit of the family of [[hosohedron|hosohedra]] {2,''p''}, as ''p'' tends to [[infinity]], thereby turning the hosohedron into a Euclidean tiling. All the vertices have then receded to infinity and the digonal faces are no longer defined by closed circuits of finite edges.

Similarly to the [[uniform polyhedra]] and the [[uniform tiling]]s, eight uniform tilings may be based from the regular apeirogonal tiling. The [[rectification (geometry)|rectified]] and [[cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] forms are duplicated, and as two times infinity is also infinity, the [[truncation (geometry)|truncated]] and [[omnitruncation|omnitruncated]] forms are also duplicated, therefore reducing the number of unique forms to four: the [[Order-2 apeirogonal tiling|apeirogonal tiling]], the apeirogonal hosohedron, the [[apeirogonal prism]], and the [[apeirogonal antiprism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] study of the [[differential geometry of surfaces]], the '''Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem''' expresses the [[Gaussian curvature]] of a surface in terms of the [[circumference]] of a [[geodesic]] circle, or the area of a geodesic disc.  The theorem is named for [[Joseph Bertrand]], [[Victor Puiseux]], and Charles François Diguet.

Let ''p'' be a point on a smooth surface ''M''. The geodesic circle of radius ''r'' centered at ''p'' is the set of all points whose geodesic distance from ''p'' is equal to&amp;nbsp;''r''. Let ''C''(''r'') denote the circumference of this circle, and ''A''(''r'') denote the area of the disc contained within the circle.  The Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem asserts that

: &lt;math&gt;K(p) = \lim_{r\to 0^+} 3\frac{2\pi r-C(r)}{\pi r^3} = \lim_{r\to 0^+} 12\frac{\pi r^2-A(r)}{\pi r^4}.&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem is closely related to the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]].

In mathematics, a '''canonical map''', also called a '''natural map''', is a map or morphism between objects that arises naturally from the definition or the construction of the objects being mapped against each other. In general it is the map which preserves the widest amount of structure, and it tends to be unique. In the rare cases where latitude in choice remains, the map is either conventionally agreed upon to be the most useful for further analysis, or sometimes simply the most elegant or beautiful known.

A closely related notion is a '''structure map''' or '''structure morphism'''; the map that comes with the given structure on the object. They are also sometimes called canonical maps.

A [[canonical isomorphism]] is a canonical map that is also an isomorphism (i.e., invertible).

In some contexts, it is necessary to address an issue of ''choices'' of canonical maps or canonical isomorphisms; see [[prestack#Definition|prestack]] for a typical example.

==Examples==
*If ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of a group ''G'', then there is a canonical map from ''G'' to the [[quotient group]] ''G/N'' that sends an element ''g'' to the coset that ''g'' belongs to.
*If ''V'' is a [[vector space]], then there is a canonical map from ''V'' to the second [[dual space]] of ''V'' that sends a vector ''v'' to the linear functional ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = λ(''v'').
*If ''f'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] from a commutative ring ''R'' to commutative ring ''S'', then ''S'' can be viewed as an [[algebra over a ring|algebra]] over ''R''. The ring homomorphism ''f'' is then called the structure map (for the algebra structure). The corresponding map on the [[prime spectrum|prime spectra]]: Spec(''S'') →Spec(''R'') is also called the structure map.
*If ''E'' is a [[vector bundle]] over a topological space ''X'', then the projection map from ''E'' to ''X'' is the structure map.
*In [[topology]], a canonical map is a function ''f'' mapping a set ''X'' → ''X'' (''X'' [[Modulo operation|modulo]] ''R''), where ''R'' is an [[equivalence relation]] in ''X'', that takes each ''x'' in ''X'' to the equivalence class ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[x]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' modulo ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq4UDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;pg=PA274|title=Handbook of Mathematics|last=Vialar|first=Thierry|date=2016-12-07|publisher=BoD - Books on Demand|isbn=9782955199008|language=en|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3325">In [[mathematics]], a '''character''' is (most commonly) a special kind of [[function (mathematics)|function]] from a [[group (mathematics)|group]] to a [[field (mathematics)|field]] (such as the [[complex numbers]]). There are at least two distinct, but overlapping meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/character|title=character in nLab|website=ncatlab.org|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses of the word "character" are almost always qualified.

==Multiplicative character==
{{main|multiplicative character}}

A '''multiplicative character''' (or '''linear character''', or simply '''character''') on a group ''G'' is a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' to the [[unit group|multiplicative group]] of a field {{Harv|Artin|1966}}, usually the field of [[complex numbers]].  If ''G'' is any group, then the set Ch(''G'') of these morphisms forms an [[abelian group]] under pointwise multiplication.

This group is referred to as the [[character group]] of ''G''. Sometimes only ''unitary'' characters are considered (thus the image is in the [[unit circle]]); other such homomorphisms are then called ''quasi-characters''. [[Dirichlet character]]s can be seen as a special case of this definition.

Multiplicative characters are [[linear independence|linearly independent]], i.e. if &lt;math&gt;\chi_1,\chi_2, \ldots , \chi_n &lt;/math&gt; are different characters on a group ''G'' then from &lt;math&gt;a_1\chi_1+a_2\chi_2 + \ldots + a_n \chi_n = 0 &lt;/math&gt; it follows that &lt;math&gt;a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_n=0 &lt;/math&gt;.

==Character of a representation==
{{main|Character theory}}
The '''character of a representation''' ''φ'' of a group ''G'' on a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' over a field ''F'' is the [[trace (matrix)|trace]] of the [[group representation|representation]] ''φ'' {{Harv|Serre|1977}}. In general, the trace is not a group homomorphism, nor does the set of traces form a group.  The characters of one-dimensional representations are identical to one-dimensional representations, so the above notion of multiplicative character can be seen as a special case of higher-dimensional characters. The study of representations using characters is called "[[character theory]]" and one dimensional characters are also called "linear characters" within this context.

In [[mathematics]], a '''Clifford–Klein form''' is a [[double coset]] space

:&amp;Gamma;\''G''/''H'',

where ''G'' is a [[Semisimple Lie group|reductive]] [[Lie group]], ''H'' a closed subgroup of ''G'', and Γ a [[discrete subgroup]] of G that acts [[properly discontinuously]] on the [[homogeneous space]] ''G''/''H''.  A suitable discrete subgroup Γ may or may not exist, for a given ''G'' and ''H''. If Γ exists, there is the question of whether Γ\''G''/''H'' can be taken to be a [[compact space]], called a '''compact Clifford–Klein form'''.

When ''H'' is  itself compact, classical results show that a compact Clifford–Klein form exists. Otherwise it may not, and there are a number of negative results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2252">In [[differential geometry]], '''Cohn-Vossen's inequality''', named after [[Stephan Cohn-Vossen]], relates the integral of [[Gaussian curvature]] of a non-compact [[surface (differential geometry)|surface]] to the [[Euler characteristic]].  It is akin to the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] for a [[compact space|compact]] surface.

A '''divergent path''' within a [[Riemannian manifold]] is a smooth curve in the manifold that is not contained within any [[compact space|compact]] subset of the manifold.  A '''complete manifold''' is one in which every divergent path has infinite [[arc length|length]] with respect to the Riemannian metric on the manifold.  Cohn-Vossen's inequality states that in every complete Riemannian 2-manifold ''S'' with finite [[total curvature]] and finite Euler characteristic, we have&lt;ref&gt;Robert Osserman, ''A Survey of Minimal Surfaces'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \iint_S K \, dA \le 2\pi\chi(S), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' is the Gaussian curvature, ''dA'' is the element of area, and ''&amp;chi;'' is the Euler characteristic.

==Examples==
* If ''S'' is a compact surface (without boundary), then the inequality is an equality by the usual Gauss&amp;ndash;Bonnet theorem for compact manifolds.
* If ''S'' has a boundary, then the Gauss&amp;ndash;Bonnet theorem gives
::&lt;math&gt;\iint_S K\, dA = 2\pi\chi(S) - \int_{\partial S}k_g\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;k_g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[geodesic curvature]] of the boundary, and its integral the [[total curvature]] which is necessarily positive for a boundary curve, and the inequality is strict.  (A similar result holds when the boundary of ''S'' is piecewise smooth.)
* If ''S'' is the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the curvature of ''S'' is zero, and ''&amp;chi;''(''S'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, so the inequality is strict: 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2{{pi}}.

==Preliminaries==
{{off topic|convex analysis|date=August 2013}}
The economics depends upon the following definitions and results from [[convex geometry]].

===Real vector spaces===

}}

A [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] of two [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]]s may be given a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in which every point is identified by a list of two real numbers, called "coordinates", which are conventionally denoted by ''x'' and ''y''. Two points in the Cartesian plane can be ''[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|added]]'' coordinate-wise
: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;);
further, a point can be ''[[scalar multiplication|multiplied]]'' by each real number ''λ'' coordinate-wise 
: ''λ'' (''x'', ''y'') = (''λx'', ''λy'').

More generally, any real vector space of (finite) dimension ''D'' can be viewed as the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible lists of ''D'' real numbers {{nowrap|{ (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''v''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;)}}&amp;nbsp;} together with two [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s: [[vector addition]] and [[scalar multiplication|multiplication by a real number]]. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, the operations of vector addition and real-number multiplication can each be defined coordinate-wise, following the example of the Cartesian plane.

===Convex sets===
[[File:Extreme points.svg|thumb|right|alt=A picture of a smoothed triangle, like a triangular tortilla-chip or a triangular road-sign. Each of the three rounded corners is drawn with a red curve. The remaining interior points of the triangular shape are shaded with blue.|In the [[convex hull]] of the red set, each blue point is a [[convex combination]] of some red points.]]
In a real vector space, a set is defined to be ''[[convex set|convex]]'' if, for each pair of its points, every point on the [[line segment]] that joins them is [[cover (mathematics)|covered]] by the set. For example, a solid [[cube (geometry)|cube]] is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a [[crescent]] shape, is non‑convex. [[Vacuous truth|Trivially]], the [[empty set]] is convex.

More formally, a set ''Q'' is convex if, for all points ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''Q'' and for every real number ''λ'' in the [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}}, the point 
: (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ'')&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''λv''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
is a [[element (mathematics)|member]] of&amp;nbsp;''Q''.

By [[mathematical induction]], a set ''Q'' is convex if and only if every [[convex combination]] of members of ''Q'' also belongs to ''Q''. By definition, a ''convex combination'' of an indexed subset&amp;nbsp;{''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;''v''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;} of a vector space is any [[weighted mean|weighted average]]&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''v''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;,}} for some indexed set of non‑negative real numbers {''λ''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;} satisfying the [[affine combination|equation]] {{nowrap|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + . . . + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

The definition of a convex set implies that the ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' of two convex sets is a convex set. More generally, the intersection of a family of convex sets is a convex set. &lt;!-- In this proposition, the family can be empty, finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite. --&gt;

===Convex hull===
For every subset ''Q'' of a real vector space, its {{nowrap|''[[convex hull]]'' Conv(''Q'')}} is the [[minimal element|minimal]] convex set that contains ''Q''. Thus Conv(''Q'') is the intersection of all the convex sets that [[cover (mathematics)|cover]] ''Q''. The convex hull of a set can be equivalently defined to be the set of all convex combinations of points in&amp;nbsp;''Q''.

==Duality: Intersecting half-spaces==

''Supporting hyperplane'' is a concept in [[geometry]]. A [[hyperplane]] divides a space into two [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]s. A hyperplane is said to '''support''' a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in the [[real coordinate space|real ''n''-space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; if it meets both of the following:
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is entirely contained in one of the two [[closed set|closed]] half-spaces determined by the hyperplane
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has at least one point on the hyperplane.
Here, a closed half-space is the half-space that includes the hyperplane.

===Supporting hyperplane theorem===
[[File:Supporting hyperplane2.svg|right|thumb|A convex set can have more than one supporting hyperplane at a given point on its boundary.]]
This [[theorem]] states that if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a closed [[convex set]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a point on the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;S,&lt;/math&gt; then there exists a supporting hyperplane containing &lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt;

The hyperplane in the theorem may not be unique, as noticed in the second picture on the right. If the closed set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is not convex, the statement of the theorem is not true at all points on the boundary of &lt;math&gt;S,&lt;/math&gt; as illustrated in the third picture on the right.

[[File:Supporting hyperplane3.svg|right|thumb|A supporting hyperplane containing a given point on the boundary of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; may not exist if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is not convex.]]

===Economics===
[[File:Indifference curves showing budget line.svg|thumb|right|The consumer prefers the vector of goods&amp;nbsp;(''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;) over other affordable vectors. At this optimal vector, the budget line supports the [[indifference curve]]&amp;nbsp;''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
An optimal basket of goods occurs where the consumer's convex [[convex preferences|preference set]] is [[supporting hyperplane|supported]]&lt;!-- "tangent" is wrong, unless differentiability is needlessly supposed, and ambiguous even then, if foliation happens --&gt; by the budget constraint, as shown in the diagram. If the preference set is convex, then the consumer's set of optimal decisions is a convex set, for example, a unique optimal basket (or even a line segment of optimal baskets).

For simplicity, we shall assume that the preferences of a consumer can be described by a [[utility function]] that is a [[continuous function]], which implies that the [[convex preferences|preference set]]s are [[closed set|closed]]. (The meanings of "closed set" is explained below, in the subsection on optimization applications.)

==Non‑convexity==
{{Main|Non-convexity (economics)}}
{{See also|Shapley–Folkman lemma}}
[[File:NonConvex.gif|thumb|right|When consumer preferences have concavities, then the linear budgets need not support equilibria: Consumers can jump between allocations.]]
If a preference set is non‑convex, then some prices produce a budget supporting two different optimal consumption decisions. For example, we can imagine that, for zoos, a lion costs as much as an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase a half an eagle and a {{nowrap|half a lion}} (or a [[griffin]])! Thus, the contemporary zoo-keeper's preferences are non‑convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2169">In mathematics, the '''correlation immunity''' of a [[Boolean function]] is a measure of the degree to which its outputs are uncorrelated with some subset of its inputs. Specifically, a Boolean function is said to be correlation-immune ''of order m'' if every subset of ''m'' or fewer variables in &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[statistically independent]] of the value of &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==
A function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{F}_2^n\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th order correlation immune if for any independent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; binary random variables &lt;math&gt;X_0\ldots X_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the random variable &lt;math&gt;Z=f(X_0,\ldots,X_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt; is independent from any random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_{i_1}\ldots X_{i_k})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0\leq i_1&lt;\ldots&lt;i_k&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Results in cryptography ==
When used in a [[stream cipher]] as a combining function for [[linear feedback shift register]]s, a Boolean function with '''low-order''' correlation-immunity is '''more susceptible''' to a [[correlation attack]] than a function with correlation immunity of '''high order'''.

Siegenthaler showed that the correlation immunity ''m'' of a Boolean function of [[algebraic degree]] ''d'' of ''n'' variables satisfies ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''; for a given set of input variables, this means that a high algebraic degree will restrict the maximum possible correlation immunity.  Furthermore, if the function is balanced then ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name="Siegenthaler"&gt;{{cite journal | author=T.

In [[telecommunications]], '''cover''' is the technique of concealing or altering the characteristics of communications patterns for the purpose of denying an unauthorized receiver [[information]] that would be of value.

The purpose of cover is not to make the communication secure, but to make it look like noise, rendering it uninteresting and not worth analysis.  Even if an attacker recognizes the communication as interesting, cover makes [[traffic analysis]] more difficult since he must crack the cover before he can find out to whom it is addressed.

Usually, the covered communication is also [[encryption|encrypted]].  In this way, enemies have no idea you sent a message; friends know you sent a message, but don't know what you said; the intended recipient knows what you said. 

''Note:'' ''Cover'' is a process of modulo two addition of a [[pseudorandom bit stream]] generated by a [[cryptographic]] device with bits from the control [[message]].

In [[cryptography]], '''Crab''' is a [[block cipher]] proposed by [[Burt Kaliski]] and [[Matt Robshaw]] at the first [[Fast Software Encryption]] workshop in 1993. Not really intended for use, Crab was developed to demonstrate how ideas from [[Cryptographic hash function|hash functions]] could be used to create a fast cipher.

Crab has an unusually large [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 8192 bits. Its creators suggested using an 80-bit key, but the cipher could use any [[key size]]. The authors didn't specify an actual [[key schedule]], only that the key is used to generate two large sets of [[Key schedule|subkeys]]: a permutation of the numbers 0 through 255, and an array of 2048 32-bit numbers. The block is divided into 256 32-bit subblocks, which are permuted at the beginning. Then the algorithm makes four passes over the data, each time applying one of four transformations adapted from [[MD5]].

A brief note on the cryptanalysis of Crab is included in Markku-Juhani Saarinen's paper on block ciphers based on [[SHA-1]] and MD5, published at FSE 2003. The author demonstrates a weakness in Crab that permits a [[distinguishing attack|distinguisher]] using no more than a dozen [[chosen plaintext attack|chosen plaintexts]], and speculates that this can be converted into a full key-recovery attack using no more than 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; chosen plaintexts. Such an attack would depend on the key schedule used.

==Biography==
Derek Wanless was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where he was educated at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle|Royal Grammar School]].&lt;ref name="durham"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/gsu/ceremonial/congregation/wanless_derek.pdf|title=Derek Wanless, Doctor of Law|accessdate=2007-09-13|format=|work=Durham University}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1967-70, he was an undergraduate at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College Cambridge]], which he attended on a support grant from Westminster Bank (a constituent of the present NatWest Bank).  He was an extraordinarily gifted mathematician and graduated as [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Banking's boy wonder: Derek Wanless - NatWest's chief has a personal touch but a pragmatic vision, says William Kay|newspaper=[[The Independent|Independent]] |date= 27 March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; On graduation he moved into banking, qualifying as a statistician, and attended the Program for Management Development at [[Harvard]].&lt;ref name="HMtreas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consultations_and_legislation/wanless/consult_wanless_info.cfm|title=Biographical Information about Derek Wanless|accessdate=2007-09-13|format=|work=HM Treasury|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003045949/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consultations_and_legislation/wanless/consult_wanless_info.cfm|archivedate=3 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Institute of Statisticians]] and a Fellow of the [[Chartered Institute of Bankers]], of which he was President in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/about_us/whos_who/sir_derek.html|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20061116120000/http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/about_us/whos_who/sir_derek.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-11-16|title=Sir Derek Wanless|accessdate=2007-09-13|work=King's Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had joined Westminster Bank, a constituent of the present [[NatWest]] Bank in 1967, beginning with a Saturday job&lt;ref name="BBCprofile"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1679718.stm |title=Profile: Derek Wanless|accessdate=2007-09-13|format=|work=BBC News|date=2004-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming NatWest's Director of Personal Banking from 1986-1988. Then becoming the General Manager for UK Branch Business and UK Financial Services before, in 1992, taking on the role of Group Chief Executive until 1999,&lt;ref name="HMtreas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Carvel|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Summing Up|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,2166719,00.html|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=2007-09-12|accessdate=2007-09-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he received a reported pay-off of £3,000,000.&lt;ref name="BBCprofile"/&gt;  It was on Friday 8 October 1999, that BBC News reported that Derek Wanless had been ousted from his position as Chief Executive. Wanless was reportedly forced out by the bank's Non-Executive Directors, who replaced him with Sir David Rowland. Wanless had been criticised by City investors for taking the bank into investment banking, and failing to curtail high costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/468624.stm | work=BBC News | title=NatWest chief executive ousted | date=1999-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As executive responsible for NatWest's card business, he led the team which invented [[Switch (debit card)|Switch]], the UK's debit card scheme. He led the NatWest Group immediately prior to its takeover, by the (then) relatively small [[Royal Bank of Scotland]].

In 2002 he carried out a review of the future funding of the [[National Health Service]] for [[Gordon Brown]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and in 2007 carried out a further review for the [[King's Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=White|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Welcome for Wanless|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2167344,00.html|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=12 September 2007|accessdate=2007-09-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He was a Non-Executive Director of [[Northern Rock]] between 2000/2007, where he was Chairman of The Northern Rock's Audit and Risk committees. His position became highly contentious, following the incipient collapse of Northern Rock in September 2007. The [[Nationalisation_of_Northern_Rock#Run_on_the_bank|Northern Rock's crisis]] was due to inadequate risk provision, and a [[Run on the bank|'run on the Bank']] was only halted with promises of unlimited UK government support.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (Sept. 2007). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6999615.stm “Northern Rock deposits guaranteed: The government has said that it will guarantee all deposits held by the embattled Northern Rock bank”], BBC News, 17 September 2007. Retrieved 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Derek was heavily criticised regarding his role in the Northern Rock affair by a committee of MPs sitting on the Commons Treasury Select Committee on 16 October 2007. Sir Derek's resignation was accepted by Northern Rock's newly appointed Chairman on 17 November 2007.
He died of [[pancreatic cancer]] at the age of 64 in 2012.&lt;ref Name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/28/sir-derek-wanless Derek Wanless Obituary in ''The Guardian'']. Retrieved 26 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations==
Sir Derek Wanless was a [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]], received a [[Knighthood]] in the [[2005 New Year Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhshistory.net/cvwanless.htm|title=Sir Derek Wanless|accessdate=2007-09-13|work=NHS History}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Doctor of Civil Law, honoris causa from [[Durham University]] on 30 June 2005.&lt;ref name="durham"/&gt; He received an Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration (Hon DBA) from Sunderland University in July 2007. A further Honorary Doctorate was awarded by [[Coventry University]] in November 2007, which prompted a ''Daily Telegraph'' article questioning the value of such awards 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/11/08/ccdiary108.xml 'Business diary: "Sir Derek becomes a doctor on the NHS"']&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Commons Select Treasury Committee published its report into the Northern Rock affair on 24 January 2008. Wanless's role as Chairman of the Risk Committee, was criticised in the report. The report's conclusion is appended below, and the full report may be found as referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|fgsTid97h6g|Treasury Select Committee Meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; #31. - ''The directors of Northern Rock were the principal authors of the difficulties that the company has faced since August 2007. It is right that members of the Board of Northern Rock have been replaced, though haphazardly, since the company became dependent on liquidity support from the Bank of England. The high-risk, reckless business strategy of Northern Rock, with its reliance on short- and medium-term [[wholesale funding]] and an absence of sufficient insurance and a failure to arrange standby facility or cover that risk, meant that it was unable to cope with the liquidity pressures placed upon it by the freezing of international capital markets in August 2007. Given that the formulation of that strategy was a fundamental role of the Board of Northern Rock, overseen by some directors who had been there since its demutualisation, the failure of that strategy must also be attributed to the Board. The non-executive members of the Board, and in particular the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and the senior non-executive director, failed in the case of Northern Rock to ensure that it remained liquid as well as solvent, to provide against the risks that it was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members.'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmtreasy/56/5602.htm House of Commons - Treasury - Fifth Report]

In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[graph theory]], a '''directed graph''' (or '''digraph''') is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that is a set of vertices connected by edges, where the edges have a direction associated with them.

==Definition==
In formal terms, a directed graph is an ordered pair {{nobreak|1=''G'' = (''V'', ''A'')}} where&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bang-Jensen|Gutin|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Diestel|2005}}, Section 1.10. {{harvtxt|Bondy|Murty|1976}}, Section 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''V'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] are called ''vertices'', ''nodes'', or ''points'';
* ''A'' is a set of [[ordered pair]]s of vertices, called ''arrows'', ''directed edges'' (sometimes simply ''edges'' with the corresponding set named ''E'' instead of ''A''), ''directed arcs'', or ''directed lines''.

It differs from an ordinary or [[undirected graph]], in that the latter is defined in terms of [[unordered pair]]s of vertices, which are usually called ''edges'', ''arcs'', or ''lines''.

The aforementioned definition does not allow a directed graph to have multiple arrows with the same source and target nodes, but some authors consider a broader definition that allows directed graphs to have such multiple arrows (namely, they allow the arrows set to be a [[multiset]]). More specifically, these entities are addressed as '''[[directed multigraph]]s''' (or '''multidigraphs''').&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, the aforementioned definition allows a directed graph to have loops (that is, arrows that connect nodes with themselves), but some authors consider a narrower definition that doesn't allow directed graphs to have loops.&lt;ref name="Chartrand"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chartrand |first=Gary |date=1977 |title=Introductory Graph Theory |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=rYuToT7vHbMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Introductory%20Graph%20Theory&amp;hl=it&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Courier Corporation |page= |isbn=9780486247755}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More specifically, directed graphs without loops are addressed as '''simple directed graphs''', while directed graphs with loops are addressed as ''loop-digraphs'' (see section [[#Types of directed graphs|Types of directed graphs]]).

==Types of directed graphs==
{{see also|Graph (discrete mathematics)#Types of graphs}}

===Subclasses===
[[File:Directed acyclic graph 2.svg|right|100px|thumb|A simple acyclic directed graph]]
[[File:4-tournament.svg|thumb|right|100px|A tournament on 4 vertices]]
* '''Symmetric directed graphs''' are directed graphs where all edges are bidirected (that is, for every arrow that belongs to the digraph, the corresponding inversed arrow also belongs to it). 
* '''Simple directed graphs''' are directed graphs that have no loops (arrows that connect vertices to themselves) and no multiple arrows with same source and target nodes. As already introduced, in case of multiple arrows the entity is usually addressed as ''[[directed multigraph]]''. Some authors describe digraphs with loops as ''loop-digraphs''.&lt;ref name="Chartrand"/&gt;
** '''Complete directed graphs''' are simple directed graphs where each pair of vertices is joined by a symmetric pair of directed arrows (it is equivalent to an undirected [[complete graph]] with the edges replaced by pairs of inverse arrows). It follows that a complete digraph is symmetric.
** '''[[Oriented graph]]s''' are directed graphs having no bidirected edges (i.e. at most one of {{nobreak|(''x'', ''y'')}} and {{nobreak|(''y'', ''x'')}} may be arrows of the graph). It follows that a directed graph is an oriented graph if and only if it hasn't any [[directed cycle|2-cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Diestel|2005}}, Section 1.10.&lt;/ref&gt;
*** '''[[Tournament (mathematics)|Tournaments]]''' are oriented graphs obtained by choosing a direction for each edge in undirected [[complete graph]]s. 
*** '''[[Directed acyclic graph]]s''' (DAGs) are directed graphs with no [[directed cycle]]s.
**** ''[[Multitree]]s'' are DAGs in which no two directed paths from a single starting vertex meet back at the same ending vertex.
**** ''[[Oriented tree]]s'' or ''polytrees'' are DAGs formed by orienting the edges of undirected acyclic graphs.
***** ''[[Rooted tree]]s'' are oriented trees in which all edges of the underlying undirected tree are directed either away from or towards the root.

===Digraphs with supplementary properties===
{{Expand list|date=August 2016}}
* '''Weighted directed graphs''' (also known as '''directed networks''') are (simple) directed graphs with ''weights'' assigned to their arrows, similarly to [[weighted graph]]s (which are also known as undirected networks or [[weighted network]]s).&lt;ref name="Chartrand"/&gt;
** '''[[Flow network]]s''' are weighted directed graphs where two nodes are distinguished, a ''source'' and a ''sink''.
* '''[[Rooted graph|Rooted directed graphs]]''' (also known as '''flow graphs''') are digraphs in which a vertex has been distinguished as the root.
** ''[[Control flow graph]]s'' are rooted digraphs used in computer science as a representation of the paths that might be traversed through a program during its execution.
* '''[[Signal-flow graph]]s''' are directed graphs in which nodes represent system variables and branches (edges, arcs, or arrows) represent functional connections between pairs of nodes.
* '''[[Flow graph (mathematics)|Flow graphs]]''' are digraphs associated with a set of linear algebraic or differential equations.
* '''[[State diagram]]s''' are [[directed multigraph]]s that represent [[finite state machine]]s.
* '''[[Commutative diagram]]s''' are digraphs used in [[category theory]], where the vertices represent (mathematical) objects and the arrows represent morphisms, with the property that all directed paths with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result by composition. 
* In the theory of [[Lie group]]s, a '''[[Quiver (mathematics)|quiver]]''' ''Q'' is a directed graph serving as the domain of, and thus characterizing the shape of, a ''representation'' ''V'' defined as a [[functor]], specifically an object of the [[functor category]] FinVct&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''F''(''Q'')&lt;/sup&gt; where ''F''(''Q'') is the [[free category]] on ''Q'' consisting of paths in ''Q'' and FinVct&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; is the category of finite-dimensional [[vector space]]s over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''.  Representations of a quiver label its vertices with vector spaces and its edges (and hence paths) compatibly with [[Linear map|linear transformations]] between them, and transform via [[natural transformation]]s.

==Basic terminology==
[[File:Incidence matrix - directed graph.svg|thumb|Oriented graph with corresponding incidence matrix]]
An arrow {{nobreak|(''x'', ''y'')}} is considered to be directed ''from'' ''x'' ''to'' ''y''; ''y'' is called the ''head'' and ''x'' is called the ''tail'' of the arrow; ''y'' is said to be a ''direct successor'' of ''x'' and ''x'' is said to be a ''direct predecessor'' of ''y''. If a [[Path (graph theory)|path]] leads from ''x'' to ''y'', then ''y'' is said to be a ''successor'' of ''x'' and ''reachable'' from ''x'', and ''x'' is said to be a ''predecessor'' of ''y''. The arrow {{nobreak|(''y'', ''x'')}} is called the ''inverted arrow'' of {{nobreak|(''x'', ''y'')}}.

The [[adjacency matrix]] of a multidigraph with loops is the integer-valued [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with rows and columns corresponding to the vertices, where a nondiagonal entry ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of arrows from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'', and the diagonal entry ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of loops at vertex ''i''. The adjacency matrix of a directed graph is unique up to identical permutation of rows and columns.

Another matrix representation for a directed graph is its [[incidence matrix]].

See [[Glossary of graph theory#Direction|direction]] for more definitions.

==Indegree and outdegree==
[[File:DirectedDegrees.svg|thumb|A directed graph with vertices labeled (indegree, outdegree)]]

For a vertex, the number of head ends adjacent to a vertex is called the ''indegree'' of the vertex and the number of tail ends adjacent to a vertex is its ''outdegree'' (called "[[branching factor]]" in trees).

Let {{nobreak|1=''G'' = (''V'', ''A'')}} and {{nobreak|''v''∈''V''}}. The indegree of ''v'' is denoted deg&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(''v'') and its outdegree is denoted deg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''v'').

A vertex with {{nobreak|1=deg&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''v'') = 0}} is called a ''source'', as it is the origin of each of its outcoming arrows. Similarly, a vertex with {{nobreak|1=deg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''v'') = 0}} is called a ''sink'', since it is the end of each of its incoming arrows.

If a vertex is neither a ''source'' nor a ''sink'', it is called an ''internal''. {{Citation needed|reason=Not found in any given reference|date=December 2017}}

The ''degree sum formula'' states that, for a directed graph,
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{v \in V} \deg^-(v) = \sum_{v \in V} \deg^+(v) = |A|.&lt;/math&gt;

If for every vertex {{nobreak|''v''∈''V''}}, {{nobreak|1=deg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''v'') = deg&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(''v'')}}, the graph is called a ''balanced directed graph''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=460|title=Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory|first1=Bhavanari|last1=Satyanarayana|first2=Kuncham Syam|last2=Prasad|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-3842-5}}; {{citation|page=51|title=Combinatorial Matrix Classes|volume=108|series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its Applications|first=Richard A.|last=Brualdi|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-86565-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degree sequence==
The degree sequence of a directed graph is the list of its indegree and outdegree pairs; for the above example we have degree sequence ((2, 0), (2, 2), (0, 2), (1, 1)). The degree sequence is a directed graph invariant so isomorphic directed graphs have the same degree sequence. However, the degree sequence does not, in general, uniquely identify a directed graph; in some cases, non-isomorphic digraphs have the same degree sequence.

The [[Digraph realization problem|directed graph realization problem]] is the problem of finding a directed graph with the degree sequence a given sequence of positive [[integer]] pairs. (Trailing pairs of zeros may be ignored since they are trivially realized by adding an appropriate number of isolated vertices to the directed graph.) A sequence which is the degree sequence of some directed graph, i.e. for which the directed graph realization problem has a solution, is called a directed graphic or directed graphical sequence. This problem can either be solved by the [[Kleitman–Wang algorithm]] or by the [[Fulkerson–Chen–Anstee theorem]].

==Directed graph connectivity==
{{main|Connectivity (graph theory)}}
A directed graph is ''weakly connected'' (or just ''connected''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bang-Jensen|Gutin|2000}} p. 19 in the 2007 edition; p. 20 in the 2nd edition (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;) if the undirected ''underlying graph'' obtained by replacing all directed edges of the graph with undirected edges is a [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected graph]]. A directed graph is ''strongly connected'' or ''strong'' if it contains a directed path from ''x'' to ''y'' and a directed path from ''y'' to ''x'' for every pair of vertices {{nobreak|{''x'', ''y''}}}. The ''strong components'' are the maximal strongly connected subgraphs.

'''''Five Equations That Changed the World: The Power and Poetry of Mathematics''''' is a [[book]] by [[Michael Guillen]], published in 1995.
It is divided into five [[chapters]] that talk about five different [[equations]] in [[physics]] and the people who have developed them.
The scientists and their equations are:
# [[Isaac Newton]] &lt;math&gt;F=GMm/r^2&lt;/math&gt; ([[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Universal Law of Gravity]])
# [[Daniel Bernoulli]] ([[Bernoulli's principle|Law of Hydrodynamic Pressure]])
# [[Michael Faraday]] ([[Faraday's law of induction|Law of Electromagnetic Induction]])
# [[Rudolf Clausius]] ([[Second Law of Thermodynamics]])
# [[Albert Einstein]] ([[Theory of Special Relativity]])

The book is a light study in science and history, portraying the preludes to and times and settings of discoveries that have been the basis of further development, including [[spacefaring|space travel]], [[flight]] and [[nuclear power]]. Each chapter of the book is divided into sections titled [[Veni, vidi, vici|Veni, Vidi, Vici.]]

The reviews of the book have been mixed. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called it "wholly accessible, beautifully written", ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote that it is a "crowd-pleasing kind of book designed to make the science as palatable as possible",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Five Equations That Changed the World|journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|date=September 15, 1995|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michael-guillen/five-equations-that-changed-the-world/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Frank Mahnke wrote that Guillen "has a nice touch for the history of mathematics and physics and their impact on the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Five Equations That Changed the World|journal=[[Naval War College Review]]|last=Mahncke|first=Frank C.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-11769876.html|date=April 1, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast, Charles Stephens panned "the superficiality of the author's treatment of scientific ideas",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Skimming the depths|first=Charles F.|last=Stephens|journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]]|date=March 1996|volume=33|issue=3|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.1996.485767}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the editors of ''[[The Capital Times]]'' called the book a "miserable failure" at its goal of helping the public appreciate the [[beauty of mathematics]].

&lt;/ref&gt; Its general usage is to identify [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[protein]] or [[nucleotide]] sequences, and to perform sequence alignments.  It detects homology by comparing a [[Hidden Markov model|profile-HMM]] to either a single sequence or a database of sequences.  Sequences that score significantly better to the profile-HMM compared to a null model are considered to be homologous to the sequences that were used to construct the profile-HMM.  Profile-HMMs are constructed from a [[multiple sequence alignment]] in the HMMER package using the ''hmmbuild'' program.  The profile-HMM implementation used in the HMMER software was based on the work of Krogh and colleagues.&lt;ref name="pmid8107089"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krogh A, Brown M, Mian IS, Sjölander K, Haussler D |title=Hidden Markov models in computational biology.

Biol. |volume=235 |issue=5 |pages=1501–31 |date=February 1994 |pmid=8107089 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1994.1104 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HMMER is a [[Command line interface|console]] utility ported to every major [[operating system]], including different versions of [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and [[Mac OS]].

HMMER is the core utility that protein family databases such as [[Pfam]] and [[InterPro]] are based upon. Some other bioinformatics tools such as [[UGENE]] also use HMMER.

HMMER3 also makes extensive use of [[SIMD|vector instructions]] for increasing computational speed.  This work is based upon earlier publication showing a significant acceleration of the [[Smith-Waterman algorithm]] for aligning two sequences.&lt;ref name="pmid17110365"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farrar M |title=Striped Smith-Waterman speeds database searches six times over other SIMD implementations |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=156–61 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17110365 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btl582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile HMMs==

A profile HMM is a variant of an HMM relating specifically to biological sequences. Profile HMMs turn a multiple sequence alignment into a position-specific scoring system, which can be used to align sequences and search databases for remotely homologous sequences.&lt;ref name="Eddy1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=SR|title=Profile hidden Markov models.|journal=Bioinformatics|date=1998|volume=14|issue=9|pages=755–63|pmid=9918945|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/14.9.755}}&lt;/ref&gt; They capitalise on the fact that certain positions in a sequence alignment tend to have biases in which residues are most likely to occur, and are likely to differ in their probability of containing an insertion or a deletion. Capturing this information gives them a better ability to detect true homologs than traditional [[BLAST]]-based approaches, which penalise substitutions, insertions and deletions equally, regardless of where in an alignment they occur.&lt;ref name="Eddy2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Sean R.|last2=Pearson|first2=William R.|title=Accelerated Profile HMM Searches|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=20 October 2011|volume=7|issue=10|pages=e1002195|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hmmer_coreProfileHMM.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|alt=The core profile HMM architecture used by HMMER.|The core profile HMM architecture used by HMMER''.]]

Profile HMMs center around a linear set of match (M) states, with one state corresponding to each consensus column in a sequence alignment. Each M state emits a single residue (amino acid or nucleotide). The probability of emitting a particular residue is determined largely by the frequency at which that residue has been observed in that column of the alignment, but also incorporates prior information on patterns of residues that tend to co-occur in the same columns of sequence alignments. This string of match states emitting amino acids at particular frequencies are analogous to position specific score matrices or weight matrices.&lt;ref name="Eddy1998" /&gt;

A profile HMM takes this modelling of sequence alignments further by modelling insertions and deletions, using I and D states, respectively. D states do not emit a residue, while I states do emit a residue. Multiple I states can occur consecutively, corresponding to multiple residues between consensus columns in an alignment. M, I and D states are connected by state transition probabilities, which also vary by position in the sequence alignment, to reflect the different frequencies of insertions and deletions across sequence alignments.&lt;ref name="Eddy1998" /&gt;

The HMMER2 and HMMER3 releases used an architecture for building profile HMMs called the Plan 7 architecture, named after the seven states captured by the model. In addition to the three major states (M, I and D), six additional states capture non-homologous flanking sequence in the alignment. These 6 states collectively are important for controlling how sequences are aligned to the model e.g. whether a sequence can have multiple consecutive hits to the same model (in the case of sequences with multiple instances of the same domain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eddy|first1=Sean|title=HMMER2 User's Guide|url=http://saf.bio.caltech.edu/saf_manuals/hmmer/v2_3_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs in the HMMER package==

The HMMER package consists of a collection of programs for performing functions using profile hidden Markov models.&lt;ref name="HMMER manual"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer3/3.1b2/Userguide.pdf| author=Sean R. Eddy| author2=Travis J. Wheeler| others=and the HMMER development team | title=HMMER User's Guide | access-date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs include:

===Profile HMM building===
*hmmbuild - construct profile HMM(s) from multiple sequence alignment(s)

===Homology searching===
*hmmscan - search protein sequence(s) against a profile HMM database
*hmmsearch - search profile HMM(s) against a sequence database
*jackhmmer - iteratively search sequence(s) against a protein database
*nhmmer - search DNA/RNA queries against a DNA/RNA sequence database
*nhmmscan - search nucleotide sequence(s) against a nucleotide profile
*phmmer - search protein sequence(s) against a protein database

===Other functions===
*hmmalign - align sequences to a profile HMM
*hmmemit - produce sample sequences from a profile HMM
*hmmlogo - produce data for an [[Sequence logo|HMM logo]] from an HMM file

The package contains numerous other specialised functions.

==The HMMER web server==

In addition to the software package, the HMMER search function is available in the form of a web server.&lt;ref name="Finn2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finn|first1=Robert D.|last2=Clements|first2=Jody|last3=Arndt|first3=William|last4=Miller|first4=Benjamin L.|last5=Wheeler|first5=Travis J.|last6=Schreiber|first6=Fabian|last7=Bateman|first7=Alex|last8=Eddy|first8=Sean R.|title=HMMER web server: 2015 update|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1 July 2015|volume=43|issue=W1|pages=W30–W38|doi=10.1093/nar/gkv397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service facilitates searches across a range of databases, including sequence databases such as [[UniProt]], [[Uniprot#UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot|SwissProt]], and the [[Protein Data Bank]], and HMM databases such as [[Pfam]], [[TIGRFAMs]] and [[SUPERFAMILY]]. The four search types phmmer, hmmsearch, hmmscan and jackhmmer are supported (see [[HMMER#Programs in the HMMER package|Programs]]). The search function accepts single sequences as well as sequence alignments or profile HMMs.

The search results are accompanied by a report on the taxonomic breakdown, and the [[Protein domain|domain]] organisation of the hits. Search results can then be filtered according to either parameter.

The web service is currently run out of the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)]] in the United Kingdom, while development of the algorithm is still performed by Sean Eddy's team in the United States.&lt;ref name="Finn2015" /&gt; Major reasons for relocating the web service were to leverage the computing infrastructure at the EBI, and to cross-link HMMER searches with relevant databases that are also maintained by the EBI.

==The HMMER3 release==

The latest stable release of HMMER is version 3.0. HMMER3 is complete rewrite of the earlier HMMER2 package, with the aim of improving the speed of profile-HMM searches. Major changes are outlined below:

===Improvements in speed===

A major aim of the HMMER3 project, started in 2004 was to improve the speed of HMMER searches. While profile HMM-based homology searches were more accurate than BLAST-based approaches, their slower speed limited their applicability.&lt;ref name="HMMER manual" /&gt; The main performance gain is due to a [[Heuristic algorithm|heuristic filter]] that finds high-scoring un-gapped matches within database sequences to a query profile.  This heuristic results in a computation time comparable to [[BLAST]] with little impact on accuracy.  Further gains in performance are due to a [[Likelihood-ratio test|log-likelihood]] model that requires no calibration for estimating [[P-value|E-values]], and allows the more accurate [[Forward algorithm|forward scores]] to be used for computing the significance of a [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid18516236"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eddy SR |title=A probabilistic model of local sequence alignment that simplifies statistical significance estimation |journal=PLoS Comput Biol |volume=4 |editor1-first=Burkhard |issue=5 |pages=e1000069 |editor1-last=Rost |year=2008 |pmid=18516236 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000069 |pmc=2396288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eddy2011" /&gt;

HMMER still lags behind BLAST in speed of DNA-based searches, however DNA-based searches can be tuned, such that an improvement in speed comes at the expense of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer3/3.1b2/RELEASE-NOTES| author=Sean R. Eddy| author2=Travis J. Wheeler| others=and the HMMER development team | title=HMMER3.1b2 Release Notes | access-date=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvements in remote homology searching===
The major advance in speed was made possible by the development of an approach for calculating the significance of results integrated over a range of possible alignments.&lt;ref name="pmid18516236" /&gt; In discovering remote homologs, alignments between query and hit proteins are often very uncertain. While most sequence alignment tools calculate match scores using only the best scoring alignment, HMMER3 calculates match scores by integrating across all possible alignments, to account for uncertainty in which alignment is best. HMMER sequence alignments are accompanied by posterior probability annotations, indicating which portions of the alignment have been assigned high confidence and which are more uncertain.

===DNA sequence comparison===
A major improvement in HMMER3 was the inclusion of DNA/DNA comparison tools. HMMER2 only had functionality to compare protein sequences.

===Restriction to local alignments===
While HMMER2 could perform glocal alignment (align a complete model to a subsequence of the target) and global alignment (align a complete model to a complete target sequence) as well as local alignment, HMMER3 only performs local alignment. This restriction is due to the difficulty in calculating the significance of hits when performing glocal/global alignments using the new algorithm.

      <comment>68000 does NOT have a half-carry flag.  But Atmel AVR does.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3585">A '''half-carry flag''' (also known as an '''auxiliary flag''' or '''decimal adjust flag''') is a condition flag bit in the [[status register]] of many [[CPU]] families, such as the [[Intel 8080]], [[Zilog Z80]], the [[x86]],&lt;ref name="intel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.intel.com/design/PentiumII/manuals/24319102.PDF |format=PDF |title=Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2: Instruction Set Reference Manual |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Atmel AVR]] series, among others. It indicates when a [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]] or borrow has been generated out of the least significant four bits of the [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] register following the execution of an [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic]] instruction. It is primarily used in decimal ([[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]]) arithmetic instructions.

== Usage ==

Normally, a processor that utilizes [[binary arithmetic]] (which includes almost all modern CPUs) will add two 8-bit byte values according to the rules of simple binary addition. For example, adding 25{{sub|16}} and 48{{sub|16}} produces 6D{{sub|16}}. However, for [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) values, where each 4-bit nibble represents a decimal digit, addition is more complicated. For example, adding the decimal value 25 and 48, which are encoded as the BCD values 25{{sub|16}} and 48{{sub|16}}, the binary addition of the two values produces 6D{{sub|16}}. Since the lower nibble of this value is a non-decimal digit (D), it must be adjusted by adding 06{{sub|16}} to produce the correct BCD result of 73{{sub|16}}, which represents the decimal value 73.

   0010 0101   25
 + 0100 1000   48
 -----------
 '''  0110 1101   6D''', ''intermediate result''
 +      0110   06, ''adjustment''
 -----------
 '''  0111 0011   73''', ''adjusted result''

Likewise, adding the BCD values 39{{sub|16}} and 48{{sub|16}} produces 81{{sub|16}}. This result does not have a non-decimal low nibble, but it does cause a carry out of the least significant digit (lower four bits) into the most significant digit (upper four bits). This is indicated by the CPU setting the half-carry flag. This value must also be corrected, by adding 06{{sub|16}} to 81{{sub|16}} to produce a corrected BCD result of 87{{sub|16}}.

   0011 1001   39
 + 0100 1000   48
 -----------
 '''  1000 0001   81''', ''intermediate result''
 +      0110   06, ''adjustment''
 -----------
 '''  1000 0111   87''', ''adjusted result''

Finally, if an addition results in a non-decimal high digit, then 60{{sub|16}} must be added to the value to produce the correct BCD result. For example, adding 72{{sub|16}} and 73{{sub|16}} produces E5{{sub|16}}. Since the most significant digit of this sum is non-decimal (E), adding 60{{sub|16}} to it produces a corrected BCD result of 145{{sub|16}}. (Note that the leading 1 digit is actually a [[carry flag|carry bit]].)

   0111 0010   72
 + 0111 0011   73
 -----------
 '''  1110 0101   E5''', ''intermediate result''
 + 0110        60, ''adjustment''
 -----------
 '''1 0100 0101  145''', ''adjusted result''

Summarizing, if the result of a binary addition contains a non-decimal low digit or causes the half-carry flag to be set, the result must be corrected by adding 06{{sub|16}} to it; if the result contains a non-decimal high digit, the result must be further corrected by adding 60{{sub|16}} to produce the correct final BCD value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2777">In [[game theory]], the Helly metric is used to assess the distance between two [[Strategy_(game_theory)|strategies]].  It is named for [[Eduard Helly]].

Consider a game &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\left\langle\mathfrak{X},\mathfrak{Y},H\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, between player I and II.  Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are the sets of [[pure strategy|pure strategies]] for players I and II respectively; and &lt;math&gt;H=H(\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the payoff function.

(in other words, if player I plays &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt; and player II plays &lt;math&gt;y\in\mathfrak{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, then player I pays &lt;math&gt;H(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to player II).

The '''Helly metric''' &lt;math&gt;\rho(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(x_1,x_2)=\sup_{y\in\mathfrak{Y}}\left| H(x_1,y)-H(x_2,y)\right|.
&lt;/math&gt;

The metric so defined is symmetric, reflexive, and satisfies the [[triangle inequality]].

The Helly metric measures distances between strategies, not in terms of the differences between the strategies themselves, but in terms of the consequences of the strategies.  Two strategies are distant if their payoffs are different.  Note that &lt;math&gt;\rho(x_1,x_2)=0&lt;/math&gt; does not imply &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; but it does imply that the ''consequences'' of &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; are identical; and indeed this induces an [[equivalence relation]].

If one stipulates that &lt;math&gt;\rho(x_1,x_2)=0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; then the topology so induced is called the [[natural topology]].

The metric on the space of player II's strategies is analogous:

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(y_1,y_2)=\sup_{x\in\mathfrak{X}}\left| H(x,y_1)-H(x,y_2)\right|.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; thus defines ''two'' Helly metrics: one for each player's strategy space.

==Conditional compactness==

Notation (definition of an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-net).  A set &lt;math&gt;X_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-net in the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with metric &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; if for any &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;x_\epsilon\in X_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\rho(x,x_\epsilon)&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

A metric space &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is '''conditionally compact''' if for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a ''finite'' &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-net in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

A game that is conditionally compact in the Helly metric has an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-optimal strategy for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other results==

If the space of strategies for one player is conditionally compact, then the space of strategies for the other player is conditionally compact (in their Helly metric).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9448">In geometry of [[normed space]]s, the '''Holmes–Thompson volume''' is a notion of [[measure (mathematics)|volume]] that allows to compare sets contained in different normed spaces (of the same dimension). It was introduced by Raymond D. Holmes and Anthony Charles Thompson.&lt;ref name=holmes1979ndimensional&gt;{{ cite journal | title = ''N''-dimensional area and content in Minkowski spaces | first = Raymond D. | last = Holmes | first2 = Anthony Charles | last2 = Thompson | journal = Pacific J.

==Definition==

The Holmes–Thompson volume &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Vol}_\text{HT}(A) &lt;/math&gt; of a measurable set &lt;math&gt; A\subseteq R^n &lt;/math&gt; in a normed space &lt;math&gt; (\mathbb{R}^n,\|-\|) &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the 2''n''-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure|measure]] of the product set &lt;math&gt; A\times B^*,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; B^* \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the dual unit ball of &lt;math&gt; \|-\| &lt;/math&gt; (the [[unit ball]] of the [[dual norm]] &lt;math&gt; \|-\|^* &lt;/math&gt;).

==Symplectic (coordinate-free) definition==

The Holmes–Thompson volume can be defined without coordinates: if &lt;math&gt; A\subseteq V&lt;/math&gt; is a measurable set in an ''n''-dimensional real normed space &lt;math&gt;(V,\|-\|),&lt;/math&gt; then its Holmes–Thompson volume is defined as the absolute value of the integral of the [[volume form]] &lt;math&gt; \frac 1{n!}\overbrace{\omega\wedge\cdots\wedge\omega}^n&lt;/math&gt; over the set &lt;math&gt; A\times B^* &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Vol}_{HT}(A)=\left|\int_{A\times B^*}\frac1{n!}\omega^n\right|&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Symplectic vector space#Standard symplectic space|standard symplectic form]] on the vector space &lt;math&gt; V\times V^* &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B^*\subseteq V^*&lt;/math&gt; is the dual unit ball of &lt;math&gt;\|-\|&lt;/math&gt;.

This definition is consistent with the previous one, because if each vector &lt;math&gt; x\in V &lt;/math&gt; is given linear coordinates &lt;math&gt; (x_i)_{0\leq i&lt;n} &lt;/math&gt; and each covector &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in V^* &lt;/math&gt; is given the [[dual basis|dual coordinates]] &lt;math&gt; (p_i)_{0\leq i&lt;n} &lt;/math&gt; (so that &lt;math&gt; \varphi(x)=\sum_i p_i x_i &lt;/math&gt;), then the standard symplectic form is &lt;math&gt; \omega=\sum_i \mathrm d x_i \wedge \mathrm d p_i &lt;/math&gt;, and the volume form is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac 1{n!} \omega^n = \pm\; \mathrm d x_0 \wedge \dots \wedge \mathrm d x_{n-1} \wedge \mathrm d p_0 \wedge \dots \wedge \mathrm d p_{n-1},&lt;/math&gt;

whose integral over the set &lt;math&gt; A\times B^* \subseteq V\times V^* \cong \mathbb R^n \times \mathbb R^n &lt;/math&gt; is just the usual volume of the set in the coordinate space &lt;math&gt; \mathbb R ^{2n} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Volume in Finsler manifolds==

More generally, the Holmes–Thompson volume of a measurable set &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; in a [[Finsler manifold]] &lt;math&gt; (M,F) &lt;/math&gt; can be defined as

::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Vol}_\text{HT}(A):=\int_{B^*A} \frac 1{n!} \omega ^n,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; B^*A=\{(x,p)\in \mathrm T^*M:\ x\in A\text{ and }p\in \mathrm T^*_xM\text{ with }\|p\|_x^*\leq 1\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cotangent bundle#Symplectic form|standard symplectic form]] on the [[cotangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt; \mathrm T^*M &lt;/math&gt;. Holmes–Thompson's definition of volume is appropriate for establishing links between the total volume of a manifold and the length of the [[geodesics]] (shortest curves) contained in it (such as [[systolic geometry|systolic inequalities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Local extremality of the Calabi–Croke sphere for the length of the shortest closed geodesic |last=Sabourau |first=Stéphane |journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society |volume=82 |issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=549–562 |bibcode=2009arXiv0907.2223S |arxiv=0907.2223 |doi=10.1112/jlms/jdq045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Isosystolic inequalities for optical hypersurfaces |last=Álvarez Paiva |first=Juan-Carlos |last2=Balacheff |first2=Florent |last3=Tzanev |first3=Kroum |journal=Advances in Mathematics |volume=301 |year=2016 |pages=934–972 |bibcode=2013arXiv1308.5522A |arxiv=1308.5522}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[filling area conjecture|filling volumes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Volume Comparison via Boundary Distances |journal=Proceedings of ICM |volume=1004 |pages=arXiv:1004.2505 |year=2010 |bibcode=2010arXiv1004.2505I |author1=Ivanov | first1=Sergei V. |arxiv=1004.2505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On two-dimensional minimal fillings |language = Russian |first=Sergei V. |last=Ivanov |journal=Algebra i Analiz |volume=13 |number=1 |pages=26–38 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On two-dimensional minimal fillings |language=english | first = Sergei V. |last=Ivanov |journal=St. Petersburg Math.

=== Computation using coordinates ===

If &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is a region in coordinate space &lt;math&gt; \mathbb R^n &lt;/math&gt;, then the tangent and cotangent spaces at each point &lt;math&gt; x\in M &lt;/math&gt; can both be identified with &lt;math&gt; \mathbb R^n &lt;/math&gt;. The Finsler metric is a continuous function &lt;math&gt; F:TM=M\times\mathbb R^n \to [0,+\infty) &lt;/math&gt; that yields a [[asymmetric norm|(possibly asymmetric) norm]] &lt;math&gt; F_x:v \in \mathbb R^n\mapsto \|v\|_x=F(x,v)&lt;/math&gt; for each point &lt;math&gt; x\in M &lt;/math&gt;. The Holmes–Thompson volume of a subset {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''M''}} can be computed as

:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Vol}_{\textrm{HT}}(A) = |B^*A| = \int_A |B^*_x| \,\mathrm d\operatorname{Vol_n}(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where for each point &lt;math&gt; x\in M &lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt; B^*_x \subseteq \mathbb R^n &lt;/math&gt; is the dual unit ball of &lt;math&gt; F_x &lt;/math&gt; (the unit ball of the [[dual norm]] &lt;math&gt; F_x^* = \|-\|_x^* &lt;/math&gt;), the bars &lt;math&gt; |-| &lt;/math&gt; denote the usual volume of a subset in coordinate space, and &lt;math&gt; \mathrm d\operatorname{Vol_n}(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the product of all {{math|''n''}} coordinate differentials &lt;math&gt; \mathrm dx_i &lt;/math&gt;.

This formula follows, again, from the fact that the {{math|2''n''}}-form &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{ \frac 1{n!} \omega ^n }&lt;/math&gt; is equal (up to a sign) to the product of the differentials of all &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; coordinates &lt;math&gt; \mathrm x_i &lt;/math&gt; and their dual coordinates &lt;math&gt; p_i &lt;/math&gt;. The Holmes–Thompson volume of {{math|''A''}} is then equal to the usual volume of the subset &lt;math&gt; B^*A = \{(x,p)\in M\times \mathbb R^n : p\in B^*_x \} &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb R^{2n} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Santaló's formula==

If &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a simple region in a Finsler manifold (that is, a region homeomorphic to a ball, with convex boundary and a unique geodesic along &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; joining each pair of points of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;), then its Holmes–Thompson volume can be computed in terms of the path-length distance (along &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;) between the boundary points of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; using [[Santaló's formula]], which in turn is based on the fact that the geodesic flow on the cotangent bundle is [[Hamiltonian dynamics|Hamiltonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Santaló formula |work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics |url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Santal%C3%B3_formula&amp;oldid=23516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normalization and comparison with Euclidean and Hausdorff measure==

The original authors used&lt;ref name=holmes1979ndimensional/&gt; a different normalization for Holmes–Thompson volume. They divided the value given here by the [[Volume of an n-ball|volume of the Euclidean ''n''-ball]], to make Holmes–Thompson volume coincide with the product measure in the standard Euclidean space &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R}^n,\|-\|_2)&lt;/math&gt;. This article does not follow that convention.

If the Holmes–Thompson volume in normed spaces (or Finsler manifolds) is normalized, then it never exceeds the [[Hausdorff measure]]. This is a consequence of the [[Blaschke-Santaló inequality]]. The equality holds if and only if the space is Euclidean (or a Riemannian manifold).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2383">In [[mathematics]] (and particularly in [[combinatorics]]), the '''major index''' of a [[permutation]] is the sum of the positions of the [[Permutation#Ascents, descents, runs and excedances|descents]] of the permutation.  In symbols, the major index of the permutation ''w'' is

: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{maj}(w) = \sum_{w(i)&gt;w(i+1)} i.
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if ''w'' is given in [[Permutation#Notation|one-line notation]] by ''w'' = 351624 (that is, ''w'' is the permutation of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} such that ''w''(1) = 3, ''w''(2) = 5, etc.) then ''w'' has descents at positions 2 (from 5 to 1) and 4 (from 6 to 2) and so maj(''w'') = 2 + 4 = 6.

This [[permutation statistic|statistic]] is named after [[Percy Alexander MacMahon|Major Percy Alexander MacMahon]] who showed in [[#CITEREFMacMahon1913|1913]] that the distribution of the major index on all permutations of a fixed length is the same as the distribution of [[Permutation#Inversions|inversions]].  That is, the number of permutations of length ''n'' with ''k'' inversions is the same as the number of permutations of length ''n'' with major index equal to ''k''.  (These numbers are known as ''Mahonian numbers'', also in honor of MacMahon.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bóna, Combinatorics of Permutations, 2004, p. 43ff, {{isbn|1-58488-434-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;)  In fact, a stronger result is true: the number of permutations of length ''n'' with major index ''k'' and ''i'' inversions is the same as the number of permutations of length ''n'' with major index ''i'' and ''k'' inversions, that is, the two statistics are equidistributed.  For example, the number of permutations of length 4 with given major index and number of inversions is given in the table below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1513">In [[combinatorics]], a '''matroid embedding''' is a [[set system]] ('''''F''''', ''E''), where '''''F''''' is a collection of ''feasible sets'', that satisfies the following properties:
# (''Accessibility Property'') Every non-empty feasible set ''X'' contains an element ''x'' such that ''X''\{''x''} is feasible;
# (''Extensibility Property'') For every feasible subset ''X'' of a ''basis'' (''i.e.'', maximal feasible set) ''B'', some element in ''B'' but not in ''X'' belongs to the '''extension''' ext(''X'') of ''X'', where ext(''X'') is the set of all elements ''e'' not in ''X'' such that ''X''∪{''e''} is feasible;
# (''Closure-Congruence Property'') For every [[superset]] ''A'' of a feasible set ''X'' disjoint from ext(''X''), ''A''∪{''e''} is contained in some feasible set for either all or no ''e'' in ext(''X'');
# The collection of all subsets of feasible sets forms a [[matroid]].

Matroid embedding was introduced by {{harvtxt|Helman|Moret|Shapiro|1993}} to characterize problems that can be optimized by a [[greedy algorithm]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1933">In [[mathematics]], '''Mazur's lemma''' is a result in the theory of [[Banach space]]s. It shows that any [[weak topology|weakly convergent]] sequence in a Banach space has a sequence of [[convex combination]]s of its members that converges strongly to the same limit, and is used in the proof of [[Tonelli's theorem (functional analysis)|Tonelli's theorem]].

==Statement of the lemma==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||) be a Banach space and let (''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;isin;'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; be a sequence in ''X'' that converges weakly to some ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'':

:&lt;math&gt;u_{n} \rightharpoonup u_{0} \mbox{ as } n \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, for every [[continuous linear functional]] ''f'' in ''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[continuous dual space]] of ''X'',

:&lt;math&gt;f(u_{n}) \to f(u_{0}) \mbox{ as } n \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Then there exists a function ''N''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''N'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''N''' and a sequence of sets of real numbers

:&lt;math&gt;\{ \alpha(n)_{k} | k = n, \dots, N(n) \}&lt;/math&gt;

such that ''&amp;alpha;''(''n'')&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0 and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k = n}^{N(n)} \alpha(n)_{k} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

such that the sequence (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;isin;'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by the convex combination

:&lt;math&gt;v_{n} = \sum_{k = n}^{N(n)} \alpha(n)_{k} u_{k}&lt;/math&gt;

converges strongly in ''X'' to ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\| v_{n} - u_{0} \| \to 0 \mbox{ as } n \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Minerva Cordero''' is a Puerto Rican mathematician, and a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]]. She is also the university's associate dean of academic affairs.&lt;ref name="UTA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/cos/news.php?ID=174|title=College of Science|website=www.uta.edu|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Cordero was born in [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico]]. Her mother, whose schooling stopped after the fifth grade, made education a top priority in the family home. She told her children "the best thing I can give you is an education."  Cordero and her siblings would do their homework together and discussed what they learned in school each day. Cordero said, "We learned each other's subjects". Wanting to go to college,  Cordero bought herself an SAT preparation book in high school and studied for the exam. Her SAT exam scores are the highest scores for her high school, Miguel Melendez Munoz High School.&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Vicki|title=Minerva-Cordero Epperson|url=http://www.maa.org/minerva-cordero-epperson|website=MAA|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cordero attended the Universidad de Puerto Rico and received her B.S. degree in 1981. She applied for and was granted a National Science Foundation Minority Graduate Fellowship. She applied to graduate schools in the United States and was accepted by the University of California Berkeley. Cordero graduated from Berkeley in 1983 with a M.S. in Mathematics. She continued her studies at the University of Iowa, and obtained her PhD in 1989.&lt;ref name="maa" /&gt;

== Professional career ==

In mathematics, the '''multi-level technique''' is a technique used to solve the [[graph partitioning problem]].

The idea of the multi-level technique is to reduce the magnitude of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] by merging vertices together, compute a [[Partition of a set|partition]] on this reduced graph, and finally project this partition on the original graph.

In the first phase the magnitude of the graph is reduced by merging vertices. The merging of vertices is done iteratively: of a graph a new coarser graph is created and of this new coarser graph an even more coarse graph is created. This is done until a certain small [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] is reached. Thus graphs with different magnitudes are induced.

In the second phase a partition of the graph with the smallest magnitude &amp;ndash; the coarsest graph &amp;ndash; is computed.

In the third and last phase, the computed partition is iteratively projected back to the original graph. In each iteration a refinement [[Heuristic algorithm|heuristic]] is applied. The merging of vertices induces a map between vertices of a graph and vertices of its coarser graph which is used for the back projection. A rebalancing to insure the size of the partition may be needed since vertices not belonging to the same partition may be merged.

The multi-level technique has shown to significantly improve the results, in terms of both quality and running time. Especially when used on heuristics considering the graph only locally, as the multi-level technique constitutes a more global view on the graph.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = The recent surge of multiscale modeling from the smallest scale (atoms) to full system level (e.g., autos) related to solid mechanics that has now grown into an international multidisciplinary activity was birthed from an unlikely source. Since the US Department of Energy (DOE) national labs started to reduce nuclear underground tests in the mid 1980s, with the last one in 1992, the idea of simulation-based design and analysis concepts were birthed. Multiscale modeling was a key in garnering more precise and accurate predictive tools. In essence, the number of large scale systems level tests that were previously used to validate a design was reduced to nothing, thus warranting the increase in simulation results of the complex systems for design verification and validation purposes.

Essentially, the idea of filling the space of system level “tests” was then proposed to be filled by simulation results.  After the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty of 1996 in which many countries pledged to discontinue all systems level nuclear testing, programs like the Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) were birthed within the Department of Energy (DOE) and managed by the national labs within the US.  Within ASCI, the basic recognized premise was to provide more accurate and precise simulation-based design and analysis tools.  Because of the requirements for greater complexity in the simulations, parallel computing and multiscale modeling became the major challenges that needed to be addressed.  With this perspective, the idea of experiments shifted from the large scale complex tests to multiscale experiments that provided material models with validation at different length scales.  If the modeling and simulations were physically based and less empirical, then a predictive capability could be realized for other conditions. As such, various multiscale modeling methodologies were independently being created at the DOE national labs: Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  In addition, personnel from these national labs encouraged, funded, and managed academic research related to multiscale modeling.  Hence, the creation of different methodologies and computational algorithms for parallel environments gave rise to different emphases regarding multiscale modeling and the associated multiscale experiments.

The advent of parallel computing also contributed to the development of multiscale modeling.  Since more degrees of freedom could be resolved by parallel computing environments, more accurate and precise algorithmic formulations could be admitted.  This thought also drove the political leaders to encourage the simulation-based design concepts.

At LANL, LLNL, and ORNL, the multiscale modeling efforts were driven from the materials science and physics communities with a bottom-up approach.  Each had different programs that tried to unify computational efforts, materials science information, and applied mechanics algorithms with different levels of success. Multiple scientific articles were written, and the multiscale activities took different lives of their own.  At SNL, the multiscale modeling effort was an engineering top-down approach starting from continuum mechanics perspective, which was already rich with a computational paradigm. SNL tried to merge the materials science community into the continuum mechanics community to address the lower length scale issues that could help solve engineering problems in practice.

Once this management infrastructure and associated funding was in place at the various DOE institutions, different academic research projects started, initiating various satellite networks of multiscale modeling research. Technological transfer also arose into other labs within the Department of Defense and industrial research communities.

The growth of multiscale modeling in the industrial sector was primarily due to financial motivations.  From the DOE national labs perspective, the shift from large scale systems experiments mentality occurred because of the 1996 Nuclear Ban Treaty.  Once industry realized that the notions of multiscale modeling and simulation based design were invariant to the type of product and that effective multiscale simulations could in fact lead to design optimization, a paradigm shift began to occur, in  various measures within different industries, as cost savings and accuracy in product warranty estimates were rationalized.

==Areas of research==
In physics and chemistry, multiscale modeling is aimed to calculation of material properties or system behavior on one level using information or models from different levels. On each level particular approaches are used for description of a system. The following levels are usually distinguished: level of [[quantum mechanical model]]s (information about electrons is included), level of [[molecular dynamics]] models (information about individual atoms is included), [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]] (information about atoms and/or groups of atoms is included), mesoscale or nano level (information about large groups of atoms and/or molecule positions is included), level of continuum models, level of device models. Each level addresses a phenomenon over a specific window of length and time. Multiscale modeling is particularly important in [[integrated computational materials engineering]] since it allows the prediction of material properties or system behavior based on knowledge of the process-structure-property relationships.

In [[operations research]], multiscale modeling addresses challenges for decision makers which come from multiscale phenomena across organizational, temporal and spatial scales. This theory fuses [[decision theory]] and multiscale mathematics and is referred to as [[multiscale decision-making]]. Multiscale decision-making draws upon the analogies between physical systems and complex man-made systems.

In meteorology, multiscale modeling is the modeling of interaction between weather systems of different spatial and temporal scales that produces the weather that we experience. The most challenging task is to model the way through which the weather systems interact as models cannot see beyond the limit of the model grid size. In other words, to run an atmospheric model that is having a grid size (very small ~ {{val|500|u=m}}) which can see each possible cloud structure for the whole globe is computationally very expensive. On the other hand, a computationally feasible [[Global climate model]] (GCM), with grid size ~ {{val|100|u=km}}, cannot see the smaller cloud systems. So we need to come to a balance point so that the model becomes computationally feasible and at the same time we do not lose much information, with the help of making some rational guesses, a process called Parametrization.

Besides the many specific applications, one area of research is methods for the accurate and efficient solution of multiscale modeling problems. The primary areas of mathematical and algorithmic development include:

*[[Analytical mechanics|Analytical modeling]]
*[[Center manifold]] and [[slow manifold]] theory
*[[Continuum mechanics|Continuum modeling]]
*[[Discrete modeling]]
*[[Network theory|Network-based modeling]]
*[[Statistical mechanics|Statistical modeling]]

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''negative hypergeometric distribution''' describes probabilities for when sampling from a finite population without replacement in which each sample can be classified into two mutually exclusive categories like Pass/Fail, Male/Female or Employed/Unemployed. As random selections are made from the population, each subsequent draw decreases the population causing the probability of success to change with each draw. Unlike the standard [[hypergeometric distribution]], which describes the number of successes in a fixed sample size, in the negative hypergeometric distribution, samples are drawn until &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; failures have been found, and the distribution describes the probability of finding &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; successes in such a sample.  In other words, the negative hypergeometric distribution describes the likelihood of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; successes in a sample with exactly &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; failures.

== Definition ==
There are &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; elements, of which &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are defined as "successes" and the rest are "failures".

Elements are drawn one after the other, ''without'' replacements, until &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; failures are encountered. Then, the drawing stops and the number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of successes is counted. The negative hypergeometric distribution, &lt;math&gt;NHG_{N,K,r}(k)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[discrete distribution]] of this &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;ref name=eom&gt;[https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Negative_hypergeometric_distribution Negative hypergeometric distribution] in Encyclopedia of Math.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome requires that we observe &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; successes in &lt;math&gt;(k+r-1)&lt;/math&gt; draws and the &lt;math&gt;(k+r)\text{-th}&lt;/math&gt; bit must be a failure. The probability of the former can be found by the direct application of the [[hypergeometric distribution]] &lt;math&gt;(HG_{N,K,k+r-1}(k)) &lt;/math&gt; and the probability of the latter is simply the number of failures remaining &lt;math&gt;(=N-K-(r-1))&lt;/math&gt; divided by the size of the remaining population &lt;math&gt;(=N-(k+r-1)&lt;/math&gt;. The probability of having exactly &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; successes up to the &lt;math&gt;r\text{-th}&lt;/math&gt; failure (i.e. the drawing stops as soon as the sample includes the predefined number of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; failures) is then the product of these two probabilities: 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\binom{K}{k} \binom{N - K}{k+r-1-k}}{\binom{N}{k+r-1}} \cdot \frac{N-K-(r-1)}{N-(k+r-1)}
=\frac{{{k+r-1}\choose{k}}{{N-r-k}\choose{K-k}}}{N \choose K}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, a [[random variable]] follows the negative hypergeometric distribution if its [[probability mass function]] (pmf) is given by

&lt;math&gt;f(k; N, K, r) \equiv \Pr(X = k) =\frac{{{k+r-1}\choose{k}}{{N-r-k}\choose{K-k}}}{N \choose K}\quad\text{for }k = 0, 1, 2, \dotsc, K&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the population size,
* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the number of success states in the population,
* &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the number of failures,
* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the number of observed successes,
* &lt;math&gt;a \choose b&lt;/math&gt; is a [[binomial coefficient]]
By design the probabilities sum up to 1. However, in case we want show it explicitly we have:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{K} \Pr(X=k) 
= \sum_{k=0}^{K} \frac{{{k+r-1}\choose{k}}{{N-r-k}\choose{K-k}}}{N \choose K}
= \frac{1}{N \choose K}\sum_{k=0}^{K} {{k+r-1}\choose{k}}{{N-r-k}\choose{K-k}}
= \frac{1}{N \choose K} {N \choose K} 
= 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where we have used that,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \sum_{j=0}^k \binom{j+m}{j} \binom{n-m-j}{k-j}
    &amp;=\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^{j} \binom{-m}{j} (-1)^{k-j} \binom{k-n-(-m)}{k-j}\\
    &amp;=(-1)^{k} \binom{k-n}{k}
    = (-1)^{k} \binom{k-(n+1)-1}{k}
    = \binom{n+1}{k},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be derived using the [[Binomial coefficient#Newton.27s binomial series|binomial identity]], &lt;math&gt;{{n \choose k} = (-1)^k {k-n-1 \choose k}}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[Chu–Vandermonde identity]], &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^k \binom m j \binom{n-m}{k-j} = \binom n k&lt;/math&gt;, which holds for any complex-values &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and any non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. 

The relationship &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^k \binom{j+m}{j} \binom{n-m-j}{k-j}= \binom{n+1}{k}&lt;/math&gt; can also be found by examination of the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^k&lt;/math&gt; in the expansion of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1-x)^{m+1}}\frac{1}{(1-x)^{n-m-k+1}}=\frac{1}{(1-x)^{n-k+2}}&lt;/math&gt;, using [[Binomial coefficient#Newton.27s binomial series|Newton's binomial series]].

== Expectation ==
When counting the number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of successes before &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; failures, the expected number of successes is &lt;math&gt;\frac{r K}{N-K+1}&lt;/math&gt; and can be derived as follows. 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    E[X] &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{K} k \Pr(X=k) 
        = \sum_{k=0}^{K} k \frac{{{k+r-1}\choose{k}}{{N-r-k}\choose{K-k}}}{N \choose K}
        = \frac{r}{N \choose K}\left[\sum_{k=0}^{K} \frac{(k+r)}{r} {{k+r-1}\choose{r-1}}{{N-r-k}\choose{K-k}}\right]-r \\
        &amp;= \frac{r}{N \choose K}\left[\sum_{k=0}^{K} {{k+r}\choose{r}}{{N-r-k}\choose{K-k}}\right]-r
        = \frac{r}{N \choose K}\left[\sum_{k=0}^{K} {{k+r}\choose{k}}{{N-r-k}\choose{K-k}}\right]-r\\
        &amp;= \frac{r}{N \choose K}\left[{{N+1} \choose K} \right]-r = \frac{rK}{N-K+1},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where we have used the relationship &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^k \binom{j+m}{j} \binom{n-m-j}{k-j}= \binom{n+1}{k}&lt;/math&gt;, that we derived above to show that the negative hypergeometric distribution was properly normalized.

== Variance ==
The variance can be derived by the following calculation.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    E[X^2] &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{K} k^2 \Pr(X=k)
    = \left[\sum_{k=0}^{K} (k+r)(k+r+1) \Pr(X=k)\right]-(2r+1)E[X]-r^2-r \\
        &amp;=\frac{r(r+1)}{N \choose K}\left[\sum_{k=0}^{K} {{k+r+1}\choose{k+1}}{{N+1-(r+1)-k}\choose{K-k}}\right]-(2r+1)E[X]-r^2-r\\
        &amp;= \frac{r(r+1)}{N \choose K}\left[{{N+2} \choose K} \right]-(2r+1)E[X]-r^2-r
        = \frac{r K (N - r + K r + 1)}{(N-K+1)(N-K+2)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the variance is &lt;math&gt;Var[X]=E[X^2]-\left(E[X]\right)^2 = \frac{r K (N + 1) (N-K-r+1)}{(N - K + 1)^2 (N - K + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

== Related distributions ==
If the drawing stops after a constant number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of draws (regardless of the number of failures), then the number of successes has the [[hypergeometric distribution]], &lt;math&gt;HG_{N,K,n}(k)&lt;/math&gt;.  The two functions are related in the following way:&lt;ref name=eom/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;NHG_{N,K,r}(k) = 1-HG_{N,N-K,k}(r-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Negative-hypergeometric distribution (like the hypergeometric distribution) deals with draws ''without replacement'', so that the probability of success is different in each draw. In contrast, negative-binomial distribution (like the binomial distribution) deals with draws ''with replacement'', so that the probability of success is the same and the trials are independent. The following table summarizes the four distributions related to drawing items:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! With replacements !! No replacements
|-
| # of successes in constant # of draws || [[binomial distribution]] || [[hypergeometric distribution]]
|-
| # of successes in constant # of failures || [[negative binomial distribution]] || negative hypergeometric distribution
|}

&lt;!-- The following section is unclear. I comment it out until it is clarified.
==Recurrence relation==

A [[recurrence relation]] for the negative hypergeometric distribution:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{array}{l}
(k-K) (n-k) p(k)-(k+1) p(k+1) (-k+K+n-N-1)=0, \\
p(0)=\frac{\binom{N-K}{n}}{\binom{N}{n}}
\end{array}\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''dimension''' of a [[partially ordered set]] (poset) is the smallest number of [[total order]]s the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of which gives rise to the partial order.
This concept is also sometimes called the '''order dimension''' or the '''Dushnik–Miller dimension''' of the partial order.
{{harvtxt|Dushnik|Miller|1941}} first studied order dimension; for a more detailed treatment of this subject than provided here, see {{harvtxt|Trotter|1992}}.

==Formal definition==
The dimension of a poset ''P'' is the least integer ''t'' for which there exists a family 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal R=(&lt;_1,\dots,&lt;_t)&lt;/math&gt;

of [[linear extension]]s of ''P'' so that, for every ''x'' and ''y'' in ''P'', ''x'' precedes ''y'' in ''P'' if and only if it precedes ''y'' in each of the linear extensions. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;P=\bigcap\mathcal R=\bigcap_{i=1}^t &lt;_i.&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative definition of order dimension is as the minimal number of [[total order]]s such that ''P'' [[order-embedding|embeds]] to the product of these total orders for the [[componentwise order]]ing, in which &lt;math&gt;x \leq y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x_i \leq y_i&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'' ({{harvnb|Hiraguti|1955}}, {{harvnb|Milner|Pouzet|1990}}).

==Realizers==
A family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal R=(&lt;_1,\dots,&lt;_t)&lt;/math&gt; of linear orders on ''X'' is called a '''realizer''' of a poset ''P'' = (''X'', &amp;lt;&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;) if 
:&lt;math&gt;&lt;_P = \bigcap\mathcal R&lt;/math&gt;,

which is to say that for any ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'',
''x'' &amp;lt;&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'' precisely when ''x'' &amp;lt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'', ''x'' &amp;lt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'', ..., and ''x'' &amp;lt;&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; ''y''.
Thus, an equivalent definition of the dimension of a poset ''P'' is "the least [[cardinality]] of a realizer of ''P''."

It can be shown that any nonempty family ''R'' of linear extensions is a realizer of a finite partially ordered set ''P'' if and only if, for every [[Critical pair (order theory)|critical pair]] (''x'',''y'') of ''P'',  ''y'' &amp;lt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''x'' for some order
&amp;lt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''R''.

== Example ==
Let ''n'' be a positive integer, and let ''P'' be the partial order on the elements ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'') in which ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''b&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' whenever ''i'' ≠ ''j'', but no other pairs are comparable. In particular, ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are incomparable in ''P''; ''P'' can be viewed as an oriented form of a [[crown graph]]. The illustration shows an ordering of this type for ''n'' = 4.

Then, for each ''i'', any realizer must contain a linear order that begins with all the ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' except ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (in some order), then includes ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', then ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ends with all the remaining ''b&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. This is so because if there were a realizer that didn't include such an order, then the intersection of that realizer's orders would have ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' preceding ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', which would contradict the incomparability  of ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''P''. And conversely, any family of linear orders that includes one order of this type for each ''i'' has ''P'' as its intersection. Thus, ''P'' has dimension exactly ''n''.  In fact, ''P'' is known as the ''standard example'' of a poset of dimension ''n'', and is usually denoted by ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Order dimension two==
The partial orders with order dimension two may be characterized as the partial orders whose [[comparability graph]] is the [[complement (graph theory)|complement]] of the comparability graph of a different partial order {{harv|Baker|Fishburn|Roberts|1971}}. That is, ''P'' is a partial order with order dimension two if and only if there exists a partial order ''Q'' on the same set of elements, such that every pair ''x'', ''y'' of distinct elements is comparable in exactly one of these two partial orders. If ''P'' is realized by two linear extensions, then partial order ''Q'' complementary to ''P'' may be realized by reversing one of the two linear extensions. Therefore, the comparability graphs of the partial orders of dimension two are exactly the [[permutation graph]]s, graphs that are both themselves comparability graphs and complementary to comparability graphs.

The partial orders of order dimension two include the [[series-parallel partial order]]s {{harv|Valdes|Tarjan|Lawler|1982}}. They are exactly the partial orders whose [[Hasse diagram]]s have [[dominance drawing]]s, which can be obtained by using the positions in the two permutations of a realizer as Cartesian coordinates.

==Computational complexity==
It is possible to determine in [[polynomial time]] whether a given finite partially ordered set has order dimension at most two, for instance, by testing whether the comparability graph of the partial order is a permutation graph. However, for any ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3, it is [[NP-complete]] to test whether the order dimension is at most ''k'' {{harv|Yannakakis|1982}}.

==Incidence posets of graphs==
The [[incidence poset]] of any [[undirected graph]] ''G'' has the vertices and edges of ''G'' as its elements; in this poset, ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if either ''x'' = ''y'' or ''x'' is a vertex, ''y'' is an edge, and ''x'' is an endpoint of ''y''. Certain kinds of graphs may be characterized by the order dimensions of their incidence posets: a graph is a [[path graph]] if and only if the order dimension of its incidence poset is at most two, and according to [[Schnyder's theorem]] it is a [[planar graph]] if and only if the order dimension of its incidence poset is at most three {{harv|Schnyder|1989}}.

For a complete graph on ''n'' vertices, the order dimension of the incidence poset is &lt;math&gt;\Theta(\log\log n)&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Hoşten|Morris|1999}}. It follows that all simple ''n''-vertex graphs have incidence posets with order dimension &lt;math&gt;O(\log\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.

== k-dimension and 2-dimension ==

A generalization of dimension is the notion of ''k''-dimension (written &lt;math&gt;\textrm{dim}_k&lt;/math&gt;) which is the minimal number of [[chain (order theory)|chains]] of length at most ''k'' in whose product the partial order can be embedded. In particular, the 2-dimension of an order can be seen as the size of the smallest set such that the order embeds in the [[containment order]] on this set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">In the [[mathematics]] of [[coding theory]], the '''Plotkin bound,''' named after Morris Plotkin, is a limit (or bound) on the maximum possible number of codewords in [[Binary coding|binary]] [[code]]s of given length ''n'' and given minimum distance ''d''.

== Statement of the bound ==
A code is considered "binary" if the codewords use symbols from the binary [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if all codewords have a fixed length ''n'',
then the binary code has length ''n''. Equivalently, in this case the codewords can be considered elements of [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2^n&lt;/math&gt; over the [[finite field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; be the minimum 
distance of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt;d = \min_{x,y \in C, x \neq y} d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamming distance]] between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The expression &lt;math&gt;A_{2}(n,d)&lt;/math&gt; represents the maximum number of possible codewords in a binary code of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and minimum distance&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. The Plotkin bound places a limit on this expression.

'''Theorem (Plotkin bound):'''

i) If &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is even and &lt;math&gt; 2d &gt; n &lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; A_{2}(n,d) \leq 2 \left\lfloor\frac{d}{2d-n}\right\rfloor. &lt;/math&gt;

ii) If &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is odd and &lt;math&gt; 2d+1 &gt; n &lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; A_{2}(n,d) \leq 2 \left\lfloor\frac{d+1}{2d+1-n}\right\rfloor. &lt;/math&gt;

iii) If &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is even, then

:&lt;math&gt; A_{2}(2d,d) \leq 4d. &lt;/math&gt;

iv) If &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is odd, then

:&lt;math&gt; A_{2}(2d+1,d) \leq 4d+4 &lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt; \left\lfloor ~ \right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[floor function]].

== Proof of case ''i)''== 
Let &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Hamming distance]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; (thus, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;A_{2}(n,d)&lt;/math&gt;). The bound is proved by bounding the quantity &lt;math&gt;\sum_{(x,y) \in C^2, x\neq y}  d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; in two different ways.

On the one hand, there are &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; choices for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and for each such choice, there are &lt;math&gt;M-1&lt;/math&gt; choices for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Since by definition &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \geq d&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; x\neq y &lt;/math&gt;), it follows that

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{(x,y) \in C^2, x\neq y} d(x,y) \geq M(M-1) d. &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;M \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix whose rows are the elements of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; be the number of zeros contained in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th column of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'th column contains &lt;math&gt;M-s_i&lt;/math&gt; ones. Each choice of a zero and a one in the same column contributes exactly &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=d(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;) to the sum &lt;math&gt;\sum_{x,y \in C} d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and therefore

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{x,y \in C} d(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^n 2s_i (M-s_i).&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity on the right is maximized if and only if &lt;math&gt;s_i = M/2&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (at this point of the proof we ignore the fact, that the &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; are integers), then

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{x,y \in C} d(x,y) \leq \frac{1}{2} n M^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the upper and lower bounds for &lt;math&gt; \sum_{x,y \in C} d(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; that we have just derived,

:&lt;math&gt; M(M-1) d \leq \frac{1}{2} n M^2&lt;/math&gt;

which given that &lt;math&gt;2d&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt; M \leq \frac{2d}{2d-n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is even, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt; M \leq 2 \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2d-n} \right\rfloor. &lt;/math&gt;

This completes the proof of the bound.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''pointed space''' is a [[topological space]] with a distinguished point, the '''basepoint'''. The distinguished point is just simply one particular point, picked out from the space, and given a name, such as ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, that remains unchanged during subsequent discussion, and is kept track of during all operations.

Maps of pointed spaces ('''based maps''') are [[continuous (topology)|continuous maps]] preserving basepoints, i.e., a map ''f'' between a pointed space ''X'' with basepoint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a pointed space ''Y'' with basepoint ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a based map if it is continuous with respect to the topologies of ''X'' and ''Y'' and if ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is usually denoted
:''f'' : (''X'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;rarr; (''Y'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).
Pointed spaces are important in [[algebraic topology]], particularly in [[homotopy theory]], where many constructions, such as the [[fundamental group]], depend on a choice of basepoint.

The [[pointed set]] concept is less important; it is anyway the case of a pointed [[discrete space]].

Pointed spaces are often taken as a special case of the [[relative topology]], where the subset is a single point.  Thus, much of [[homotopy theory]] is usually developed on pointed spaces, and then moved to relative topologies in [[algebraic topology]].

==Category of pointed spaces==
The [[class (set theory)|class]] of all pointed spaces forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''Top'''&lt;sub&gt;•&lt;/sub&gt; with basepoint preserving continuous maps as [[morphism]]s. Another way to think about this category is as the [[comma category]], ({•} ↓ '''Top''') where {•} is any one point space and '''Top''' is the [[category of topological spaces]]. (This is also called a [[coslice category]] denoted {•}/'''Top'''.) Objects in this category are continuous maps {•} → ''X''. Such morphisms can be thought of as picking out a basepoint in ''X''. Morphisms in ({•} ↓ '''Top''') are morphisms in '''Top''' for which the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
[[Image:PointedSpace-01.png]]
&lt;/div&gt;

It is easy to see that commutativity of the diagram is equivalent to the condition that ''f'' preserves basepoints.

As a pointed space, {•} is a [[zero object]] in '''Top'''&lt;sub&gt;•&lt;/sub&gt;, while it is only a [[terminal object]] in '''Top'''.

There is a [[forgetful functor]] '''Top'''&lt;sub&gt;•&lt;/sub&gt; → '''Top''' which "forgets" which point is the basepoint. This functor has a [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] which assigns to each topological space ''X'' the [[disjoint union]] of ''X'' and a one-point space {•} whose single element is taken to be the basepoint.

==Operations on pointed spaces==
*A '''subspace''' of a pointed space ''X'' is a [[subspace (topology)|topological subspace]] ''A'' ⊆ ''X'' which shares its basepoint with ''X'' so that the [[inclusion map]] is basepoint preserving.
*One can form the '''[[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]]''' of a pointed space ''X'' under any [[equivalence relation]]. The basepoint of the quotient is the image of the basepoint in ''X'' under the quotient map.
*One can form the '''[[product (category theory)|product]]''' of two pointed spaces (''X'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), (''Y'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) as the [[product (topology)|topological product]] ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' with (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) serving as the basepoint.
*The '''[[coproduct]]''' in the category of pointed spaces is the ''[[wedge sum]]'', which can be thought of as the 'one-point union' of spaces.
*The '''[[smash product]]''' of two pointed spaces is essentially the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of the direct product and the wedge sum. We would like to say that the smash product turns the category of pointed spaces into a [[symmetric monoidal category]] with the pointed [[0-sphere]] as the unit object, but this is false for general spaces: the associativity condition might fail. But it is true for some more restricted categories of spaces, such as [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[weak Hausdorff space|weak Hausdorff]] ones.
*The '''[[reduced suspension]]''' Σ''X'' of a pointed space ''X'' is (up to a [[homeomorphism]]) the smash product of ''X'' and the pointed circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The reduced suspension is a functor from the category of pointed spaces to itself. This functor is [[left adjoint]] to the functor &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; taking a pointed space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to its [[loop space]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega X&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], '''''quadrature''''' is a historical term which means the process of determining [[area]]. This term is still used nowadays in the context of [[differential equation]]s, where "solving an equation by quadrature" means expressing its solution in terms of [[antiderivative|integrals]].

Quadrature problems served as one of the main sources of problems in the development of [[calculus]], and introduce important topics in [[mathematical analysis]].

== History ==
[[File:Geometric mean.svg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Antique method to find the [[geometric mean]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Greek mathematics|Mathematicians of ancient Greece]], according to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine, understood determination of [[area]] of a figure as the process of geometrically constructing a [[square (geometry)|square]] having the same area  (''squaring''), thus the name ''quadrature'' for this process. The Greek geometers were not always successful (see [[quadrature of the circle]]), but they did carry out quadratures of some figures whose sides were not simply line segments, such as the [[lune of Hippocrates|lunes of Hippocrates]] and  [[The Quadrature of the Parabola|the quadrature of the parabola]]. By Greek tradition, these constructions had to be performed using only a [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].

For a quadrature of a [[rectangle]] with the sides ''a'' and ''b'' it is necessary to construct a square with the side &lt;math&gt;x =\sqrt {ab}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[geometric mean]] of ''a'' and ''b''). For this purpose it is possible to use the following: if one draws the circle with diameter made from joining line segments of lengths ''a'' and ''b'', then the height (''BH'' in the diagram) of the line segment drawn perpendicular to the diameter, from the point of their connection to the point where it crosses the circle, equals the geometric mean of ''a'' and ''b''. A similar geometrical construction solves the problems of quadrature of a parallelogram and of a triangle.

[[File:Parabola and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;The area of a segment of a parabola is 4/3 that of the area of a certain inscribed triangle.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Problems of quadrature for [[curvilinear]] figures are much more difficult. The quadrature of the circle with compass and straightedge was proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example a lune of Hippocrates) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of the surface of a sphere and a [[parabola]] segment discovered by [[Archimedes]] became the highest achievement of analysis in antiquity.
:* The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to four times the area of the circle formed by a [[great circle]] of this sphere.
:* The area of a segment of a parabola determined by a straight line cutting it is 4/3 the area of a triangle inscribed in this segment.
For the proof of these results, Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]]&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|title=A History of Mathematics: An Introduction|edition= 2nd|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|year=1998|isbn=0321016181}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}} of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]].

In medieval Europe, quadrature meant the calculation of area by any method. Most often the [[method of indivisibles]] was used; it was less rigorous than the geometric constructions of the Greeks, but it was simpler and more powerful. With its help, [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Gilles de Roberval]] found the area of a [[cycloid]] arch, [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] investigated the area under a [[hyperbola]] (''Opus Geometricum'', 1647),&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt;{{rp|491}} and [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to [[logarithm]]s.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;{{rp|492}}&lt;ref&gt;Enrique A. Gonzales-Velasco (2011) ''Journey through Mathematics'', § 2.4 Hyperbolic Logarithms, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wallis]] algebrised this method; he wrote in his ''Arithmetica Infinitorum'' (1656) some series which are equivalent to what is now called the [[definite integral]], and he calculated their values. [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] made further progress: quadratures for some [[algebraic curves]] and [[spiral]]s. [[Christiaan Huygens]] successfully performed a quadrature of the surface area of some [[Solid of revolution|solids of revolution]].

The quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new [[function(mathematics)|function]], the [[natural logarithm]], of critical importance. With the invention of [[integral calculus]] came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term ''quadrature'' has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase ''finding the area'' is more commonly used for what is technically the ''computation of a univariate definite integral''.

In [[geometry]], the '''rhombitriheptagonal tiling''' is a semiregular tiling of the 
[[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]]. At each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of the tiling there is one [[triangle]] and one [[heptagon]], alternating between two [[square (geometry)|square]]s. The tiling has [[Schläfli symbol]] rr{7,&amp;nbsp;3}.  It can be seen as constructed as a [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[triheptagonal tiling]], r{7,3}, as well as an [[Expansion (geometry)|expanded]] [[heptagonal tiling]] or expanded [[order-7 triangular tiling]].

== Dual tiling ==

The dual tiling is called a ''deltoidal triheptagonal tiling'', and consists of congruent [[kite (geometry)|kites]]. It is formed by overlaying an [[order-3 heptagonal tiling]] and an [[order-7 triangular tiling]].

From a [[Wythoff construction]] there are eight hyperbolic [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|uniform tilings]] that can be based from the regular heptagonal tiling. 

Drawing the tiles colored as red on the original faces, yellow at the original vertices, and blue along the original edges, there are 8 forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20122">In [[computability theory]], '''Rice's theorem''' states that all non-trivial, [[Semantics (computer science)|semantic]] properties of programs are [[decision problem|undecidable]]. A semantic property is one about the program's behavior (for instance, does the program [[halting problem|terminate]] for all inputs), unlike a syntactic property (for instance, does the program contain an [[if-then-else]] statement). A property is ''non-trivial'' if it is neither true for every computable function, nor false for every computable function.

Rice's theorem can also be put in terms of functions: for any non-trivial property of [[partial functions]], no general and effective method can decide whether an [[algorithm]] computes a partial function with that property. Here, a property of partial functions is called ''trivial'' if it holds for all [[partial computable function]]s or for none, and an effective decision method is called ''general'' if it decides correctly for every algorithm.
The theorem is named after [[Henry Gordon Rice]], who proved it in his doctoral dissertation of 1951 at [[Syracuse University]]. It is also known as the '''Rice–Myhill–Shapiro theorem''' after Rice, [[John Myhill]], and [[Norman Shapiro]].

==Introduction==
Another way of stating Rice's theorem that is more useful in [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]] follows.

Let ''S'' be a set of [[Formal language|languages]] that is nontrivial, meaning
# there exists a Turing machine that recognizes a language in ''S''
# there exists a Turing machine that recognizes a language not in ''S''
Then, it is [[decision problem|undecidable]] to determine whether the language recognized by an arbitrary [[Turing machine]] lies in ''S''.

In practice, this means that there is no machine that can always decide whether the language of a given Turing machine has a particular nontrivial property. Special cases include the undecidability of whether a Turing machine accepts a particular string, whether a Turing machine recognizes a particular recognizable language, and whether the language recognized by a Turing machine could be recognized by a nontrivial simpler machine, such as a [[finite automaton]].

It is important to note that Rice's theorem does not say anything about those properties of machines or programs that are not also properties of functions and languages.  For example, whether a machine runs for more than 100 steps on some input is a decidable property, even though it is non-trivial.  Implementing exactly the same language, two different machines might require a different number of steps to recognize the same input.  Similarly, whether a machine has more than 5 states is a decidable property of the machine, as the number of states can simply be counted. Where a property is of the kind that either of the two machines may or may not have it, while still implementing exactly the same language, the property is of the machines and not of the language, and Rice's Theorem does not apply.

Using [[Hartley Rogers, Jr|Rogers]]' characterization of [[Roger's equivalence theorem|acceptable programming system]]s, Rice's Theorem may essentially be generalized from Turing machines to most computer [[programming language]]s: there exists no automatic method that decides with generality non-trivial questions on the behavior of computer programs.

As an example, consider the following variant of the [[halting problem]]. Let ''P'' be the following property of partial functions '''F''' of one argument: ''P''('''F''') means that '''F''' is defined for the argument '1'.  It is obviously non-trivial, since there are partial functions that are defined at 1, and others that are undefined at 1.  The ''1-halting problem'' is the problem of deciding of any algorithm whether it defines a function with this property,
i.e., whether the algorithm halts on input 1. By Rice's theorem, the 1-halting problem is undecidable. Similarly the question of whether a Turing machine ''T'' terminates on an initially empty tape (rather than with an initial word ''w'' given as second argument in addition to a description of ''T'', as in the full halting problem) is still undecidable.

==Formal statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;\phi\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[admissible numbering]] of the [[computable function]]s; a map from the [[natural numbers]] to the class &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; of unary (partial) computable functions.
Denote by &lt;math&gt;\phi_e:=\phi(e)&lt;/math&gt; the {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;}}th (partial) computable function.

We identify each ''property'' that a computable function may have with the subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the functions with that property.
Thus given a set &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq \mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;, a computable function &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt; has property &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\phi_e \in F&lt;/math&gt;.  For each property &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq \mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; there is an associated [[decision problem]] &lt;math&gt;D_F&lt;/math&gt; of determining, given ''e'', whether &lt;math&gt;\phi_e \in F&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Rice's theorem''' states that the decision problem &lt;math&gt;D_F&lt;/math&gt; is [[recursive set|decidable]] (also called recursive or computable) if and only if &lt;math&gt;F = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;F = \mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
According to Rice's theorem, if there is at least one computable function in a particular class ''C'' of computable functions and another computable function not in ''C'' then the problem of deciding whether a particular program computes a function in ''C'' is undecidable.  For example, Rice's theorem shows that each of the following sets of computable functions is undecidable:
* The class of computable functions that return ''0'' for every input, and its complement.
* The class of computable functions that return ''0'' for at least one input, and its complement.
* The class of computable functions that are constant, and its complement.
* The class of indices for computable functions that are total &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soare|first1=Robert I.|title=Recursively Enumerable Sets and Degrees|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The class of indices for [[recursively enumerable set]]s that are cofinite
* The class of indices for recursively enumerable sets that are recursive

==Proof by Kleene's recursion theorem==
[[Kleene's recursion theorem#Application to quines|A corollary]] to [[Kleene's recursion theorem]] states that for every [[Gödel number]]ing &lt;math&gt;\phi\colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[computable function]]s and every computable function &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, there is an index &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_e(y)&lt;/math&gt; returns &lt;math&gt;Q(e,y)&lt;/math&gt;. (In the following, we say that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; "returns" &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; if either &lt;math&gt;f(x)=g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or both &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; are undefined.) Intuitively, &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Quine (computing)|quine]], a function that returns its own source code (Gödel number), except that rather than returning it directly, &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt; passes its Gödel number to &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and returns the result.

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a set of computable functions such that &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \neq F \neq \mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;. Then there are computable functions &lt;math&gt;f \in F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g \notin F&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that the set of indices &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_x \in F&lt;/math&gt; is decidable; then, there exists a function &lt;math&gt;Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; that returns &lt;math&gt;g(y)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\phi_x \in F&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(y)&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. By the corollary to the recursion theorem, there is an index &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_e(y)&lt;/math&gt; returns &lt;math&gt;Q(e,y)&lt;/math&gt;. But then, if &lt;math&gt;\phi_e \in F&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt; is the same function as &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\phi_e \notin F&lt;/math&gt;; and if &lt;math&gt;\phi_e \notin F&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\phi_e \in F&lt;/math&gt;. In both cases, we have a contradiction.

==Proof by reduction from the halting problem==

===Proof sketch===
Suppose, for concreteness, that we have an algorithm for examining a program ''p'' and determining infallibly whether ''p'' is an implementation of the squaring function, which takes an integer ''d'' and returns ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The proof works just as well if we have an algorithm for deciding any other nontrivial property of program behavior (i.e a semantic and non-trivial property), and is given in general below.

The claim is that we can convert our algorithm for identifying squaring programs into one that identifies functions that halt.  We will describe an algorithm that takes inputs ''a'' and ''i'' and determines whether program ''a'' halts when given input ''i''.

The algorithm for deciding this is conceptually simple: it constructs (the description of) a new program ''t'' taking an argument ''n'', which (1) first executes program ''a'' on input ''i'' (both ''a'' and ''i'' being hard-coded into the definition of ''t''), and (2) then returns the square of ''n''. If ''a''(''i'') runs forever, then ''t'' never gets to step (2), regardless of ''n''. Then clearly,  ''t'' is a function for computing squares if and only if step (1) terminates.  Since we've assumed that we can infallibly identify programs for computing squares, we can determine whether ''t'', which depends on ''a'' and ''i'', is such a program, and that for every ''a'' and ''i''; thus we have obtained a program that decides whether program ''a'' halts on input ''i''.  Note that our halting-decision algorithm never executes ''t'', but only passes its description to the squaring-identification program, which by assumption always terminates; since the construction of the description of ''t'' can also be done in a way that always terminates, the halting-decision cannot fail to halt either.

  halts (a,i) {
    define t(n) {
      a(i)
      '''return''' n×n
    }
    '''return''' is_a_squaring_function(t)
  }

This method doesn't depend specifically on being able to recognize functions that compute squares; as long as ''some'' program can do what we're trying to recognize, we can add a call to ''a'' to obtain our ''t''. We could have had a method for recognizing programs for computing square roots, or programs for computing the monthly payroll, or programs that halt when given the input &lt;tt&gt;"Abraxas"&lt;/tt&gt;; in each case, we would be able to solve the halting problem similarly.

===Formal proof===
[[Image:Rice reduction.svg|thumb|If we have an algorithm that decides a non-trivial property, we can construct a Turing machine that decides the halting problem.]]

For the formal proof, algorithms are presumed to define partial functions over [[string (computer science)|strings]] and are themselves represented by strings. The partial function computed by the algorithm represented by a string ''a'' is denoted '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;. This proof proceeds by [[reductio ad absurdum]]: we assume that there is a non-trivial property that is decided by an algorithm, and then show that it follows that we can decide the [[halting problem]], which is not possible, and therefore a contradiction.

Let us now assume that ''P''(''a'') is an algorithm that decides some non-trivial property of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;. Without loss of
generality we may assume that ''P''(''no-halt'') = "no", with ''no-halt'' being the representation of an algorithm that never halts. If this is not true, then this holds for the negation of the property. Since ''P'' decides a non-trivial property, it follows that there is a string ''b'' that represents an algorithm and ''P''(''b'') = "yes".  We can then define an algorithm ''H''(''a'', ''i'') as follows:

:1. construct a string ''t'' that represents an algorithm ''T''(''j'') such that
:* ''T'' first simulates the computation of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''i'')
:* then ''T'' simulates the computation of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''j'') and returns its result.
:2. return ''P''(''t'').

We can now show that ''H'' decides the halting problem:

* Assume that the algorithm represented by ''a'' halts on input ''i''. In this case '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; and, because ''P''(''b'') = "yes" and the output of ''P''(''x'') depends only on '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that ''P''(''t'') = "yes" and, therefore ''H''(''a'', ''i'') = "yes".
* Assume that the algorithm represented by ''a'' does not halt on input ''i''. In this case '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''no-halt''&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e., the partial function that is never defined. Since ''P''(''no-halt'') = "no" and the output of ''P''(''x'') depends only on '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that ''P''(''t'') = "no" and, therefore ''H''(''a'', ''i'') = "no".

Since the halting problem is known to be undecidable, this is a contradiction and the assumption that there is an algorithm ''P''(''a'') that decides a non-trivial property for the function represented by ''a'' must be false.

==Rice's theorem and index sets==
Rice's theorem can be succinctly stated in terms of index sets:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of partial recursive functions with [[index set (recursion theory)|index set]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is recursive if and only if &lt;math&gt;C = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C = \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[natural numbers]], including [[zero]].

==An analogue of Rice's theorem for recursive sets==
One can regard Rice's theorem as asserting the impossibility of effectively deciding for any ''recursively enumerable'' set
whether it has a certain nontrivial property.&lt;ref&gt;A set &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is '''[[Recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable]]''' if
&lt;math&gt;S=W_e:=\textrm{dom}\, \phi_e:=\{x: \phi_e(x)\downarrow \}&lt;/math&gt;
for some &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;W_e&lt;/math&gt; is the domain &lt;math&gt;\textrm{dom}\, \phi_e&lt;/math&gt;
(the set of inputs &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;\phi_e(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined) of &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt;.
The result for recursively enumerable sets can be obtained from that for (partial) computable functions by
considering the class &lt;math&gt;\{\phi_e: \textrm{dom}\, \phi_e \in C\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a class of
recursively enumerable sets.&lt;/ref&gt;
In this section, we give an analogue of Rice's theorem for [[recursive set]]s'','' instead of recursively enumerable sets.&lt;ref&gt;A recursively enumerable
set &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is '''[[Recursive set|recursive]]''' if its complement is recursively enumerable.
Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is recursive if its characteristic function is computable.&lt;/ref&gt;
Roughly speaking, the analogue says that if one can effectively determine for every ''recursive'' set whether it has a certain property,
then only finitely many integers determine whether a recursive set has the property.
This result is analogous to the original theorem of Rice, because both results assert that a property is "decidable"
only if one can determine whether a set has that property by examining ''for at most finitely many &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;''
(for no &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, for the original theorem), if &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the set.

Let &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be a class (called a ''simple game'' and thought of as a property) of recursive sets.
If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a recursive set, then for some &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, computable function &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt;
is the characteristic function of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  We call &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; a '''characteristic index''' for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
(There are infinitely many such &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.)
Let's say the class &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is ''computable'' if there is an algorithm (computable function) that decides
for any nonnegative integer &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily a characteristic index),
* if &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic index for a recursive set belonging to  &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, then the algorithm gives "yes";
* if &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic index for a recursive set not belonging to &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, then the algorithm gives "no".

A set &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; ''extends'' a string &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of 0's and 1's
if for every &lt;math&gt;k&lt; |\tau|&lt;/math&gt; (the length of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;),
the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th element of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is 1 if &lt;math&gt;k\in S&lt;/math&gt;; and is 0 otherwise.
For example, &lt;math&gt;S=\{1,3,4,7, \ldots \}&lt;/math&gt; extends the string &lt;math&gt;01011001&lt;/math&gt;.
A string &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is ''winning determining'' if every recursive set extending &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.
A string &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is ''losing determining'' if no recursive set extending &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23638">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], a '''rook polynomial''' is a [[generating polynomial]] of the number of ways to place non-attacking [[rook (chess)|rooks]] on a '''board''' that looks like a [[checkerboard]]; that is, no two rooks may be in the same row or column.  The board is any subset of the squares of a rectangular board with ''m'' rows and ''n'' columns; we think of it as the squares in which one is allowed to put a rook.  The board is the ordinary [[chessboard]] if all squares are allowed and ''m'' = ''n'' = 8 and a chessboard of any size if all squares are allowed and ''m'' = ''n''.  The [[coefficient]] of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in the rook polynomial ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the number of ways ''k'' rooks, none of which attacks another, can be arranged in the squares of ''B''.  The rooks are arranged in such a way that there is no pair of rooks  in the same row or column.  In this sense, an arrangement is the positioning of rooks on a static, immovable board; the arrangement will not be different if the board is rotated or reflected while keeping the squares stationary. The polynomial also remains the same if rows are interchanged or columns are interchanged.

The term "rook polynomial" was coined by [[John Riordan (mathematician)|John Riordan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Riordan (mathematician)|John Riordan]],  [https://books.google.com/books?id=zWgIPlds29UC ''An Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis''], Princeton University Press, 1980 (originally published by John Wiley and Sons, New York; Chapman and Hall, London, 1958) {{isbn|978-0-691-02365-6}} (reprinted again in 2002, by Dover Publications). See chapters 7 &amp; 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite the name's derivation from [[chess]], the impetus for studying rook polynomials is their connection with counting [[permutation]]s (or [[partial permutation]]s) with restricted positions.  A board ''B'' that is a subset of the ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' chessboard corresponds to permutations of ''n'' objects, which we may take to be the numbers 1, 2, ..., ''n'', such that the number ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in the ''j''-th position in the permutation must be the column number of an allowed square in row ''j'' of ''B''.  Famous examples include the number of ways to place ''n'' non-attacking rooks on:
*an entire ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' chessboard, which is an elementary combinatorial problem;
*the same board with its diagonal squares forbidden; this is the [[derangement]] or "hat-check" problem;
*the same board without the squares on its diagonal and immediately above its diagonal (and without the bottom left square), which is essential in the solution of the [[problème des ménages]].

Interest in rook placements arises in pure and applied combinatorics, [[group theory]], [[number theory]], and [[statistical physics]].  The particular value of rook polynomials comes from the utility of the generating function approach, and also from the fact that the [[zero of a function|zeroes]] of the rook polynomial of a board provide valuable information about its coefficients, i.e., the number of non-attacking placements of ''k'' rooks.

== Definition ==

The '''rook polynomial''' ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') of a board ''B'' is the [[generating function]] for the numbers of arrangements of non-attacking rooks:

: &lt;math&gt;R_B(x)= \sum_{k=0}^\infty r_k(B) x^k&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of ways to place ''k'' non-attacking rooks on the board.  Despite the notation, this is a finite sum, since the board is finite so there is a maximum number of non-attacking rooks it can hold; indeed, there cannot be more rooks than the smaller of the number of rows and columns in the board.

=== Complete boards ===
The first few rook polynomials on square ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' boards are (with ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;):

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  R_1(x) &amp; = x + 1 \\
  R_2(x) &amp; = 2 x^2 + 4 x + 1 \\
  R_3(x) &amp; = 6 x^3 + 18 x^2 + 9 x + 1 \\
  R_4(x) &amp; = 24 x^4 + 96 x^3 + 72 x^2 + 16 x + 1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In words, this means that on a 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1 board, 1 rook can be arranged in 1 way, and zero rooks can also be arranged in 1 way (empty board); on a complete 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 board, 2 rooks can be arranged in 2 ways (on the diagonals), 1 rook can be arranged in 4 ways, and zero rooks can be arranged in 1 way; and so forth for larger boards.

For complete ''m''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' rectangular boards ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; we write ''R&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;.  The smaller of ''m'' and ''n'' can be taken as an upper limit for ''k'', since obviously ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 if ''k'' &amp;gt; min(''m'', ''n'').  This is also shown in the formula for ''R&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'').

The rook polynomial of a rectangular chessboard is closely related to the generalized [[Laguerre polynomial]] ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') by the identity

: &lt;math&gt;R_{m,n}(x)= n! x^n L_n^{(m-n)}(-x^{-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

== Matching polynomials ==

A rook polynomial is a special case of one kind of [[matching polynomial]], which is the generating function of the number of ''k''-edge [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]]s in a graph.

The rook polynomial ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') corresponds to the [[complete bipartite graph]]&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;.  The rook polynomial of a general board ''B'' ⊆ ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the bipartite graph with left vertices ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and right vertices ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and an edge ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; whenever the square (''i'',&amp;nbsp;''j'') is allowed, i.e., belongs to ''B''.  Thus, the theory of rook polynomials is, in a sense, contained in that of matching polynomials.

We deduce an important fact about the coefficients ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, which we recall given the number of non-attacking placements of ''k'' rooks in ''B'': these numbers are [[unimodal]], i.e., they increase to a maximum and then decrease.  This follows (by a standard argument) from the theorem of Heilmann and Lieb&lt;ref&gt;Ole J. Heilmann and Elliott H. Lieb, Theory of monomer-dimer systems.  ''Communications in Mathematical Physics'', Vol. 25 (1972), pp. 190–232.&lt;/ref&gt; about the zeroes of a matching polynomial (a different one from that which corresponds to a rook polynomial, but equivalent to it under a change of variables), which implies that all the zeroes of a rook polynomial are negative real numbers.

== Connection to matrix permanents ==

For incomplete square ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' boards, (i.e. rooks are not allowed to be played on some arbitrary subset of the board's squares) computing the number of ways to place ''n'' rooks on the board is equivalent to computing the [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] of a 0–1 matrix.

}}

A precursor to the rook polynomial is the classic "Eight rooks problem" by H. E. Dudeney&lt;ref&gt;Dudeney, Henry E. Amusements In Mathematics. 1917. Nelson. (republished by Plain Label Books: {{isbn|1-60303-152-9}}, also as a collection of newspaper clippings, Dover Publications, 1958; Kessinger Publishing, 2006). The book can be freely downloaded from [[Project Gutenberg]] site [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16713]&lt;/ref&gt; in which he shows that the maximum number of non-attacking rooks on a chessboard is eight by placing them on one of the main diagonals (Fig. 1). The question asked is: "In how many ways can eight rooks be placed on an 8 × 8 chessboard so that neither of them attacks the other?" The answer is: "Obviously there must be a rook in every row and every column. Starting with the bottom row, it is clear that the first rook can be put on any one of eight different squares (Fig. 1). Wherever it is placed, there is the option of seven squares for the second rook in the second row. Then there are six squares from which to select the third row, five in the fourth, and so on. Therefore the number of different ways must be 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320" (that is, 8&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;, where "!" is [[factorial]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dudeney, Problem 295&lt;/ref&gt;

The same result can be obtained in a slightly different way. Let us endow each rook with a positional number, corresponding to the number of its rank, and assign it a name that corresponds to the name of its file. Thus, rook a1 has position 1 and name "a", rook b2 has position 2 and name "b", etc. Then let us order the rooks into an ordered list ([[sequence]]) by their positions. The diagram on Fig. 1 will then transform in the sequence (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h). Placing any rook on another file would involve moving the rook that hitherto occupied the second file to the file, vacated by the first rook. For instance, if rook a1 is moved to "b" file, rook b2 must be moved to "a" file, and now they will become rook b1 and rook a2. The new sequence will become (b,a,c,d,e,f,g,h). In combinatorics, this operation is termed [[permutation]], and the sequences, obtained as a result of the permutation, are permutations of the given sequence. The total number of permutations, containing 8 elements from a sequence of 8 elements is 8! ([[factorial]] of 8).

To assess the effect of the imposed limitation "rooks must not attack each other", let us consider the problem without such limitation. In how many ways can eight rooks be placed on an 8 × 8 chessboard? This will be the total number of [[combination]]s of 8 rooks on 64 squares:

:&lt;math&gt; {64 \choose 8} = \frac{64!}{8!(64-8)!} = 4,426,165,368.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the limitation "rooks must not attack each other" reduces the total number of allowable positions from combinations to permutations which is a factor of about 109,776.

A number of problems from different spheres of human activity can be reduced to the rook problem by giving them a "rook formulation". As an example: A company must employ ''n'' workers on ''n'' different jobs and each job must be carried out only by one worker. In how many ways can this appointment be done?

Let us put the workers on the ranks of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' chessboard, and the jobs − on the files. If worker ''i'' is appointed to job ''j'', a rook is placed on the square where rank ''i'' crosses file ''j''. Since each job is carried out only by one worker and each worker is appointed to only one job, all files and ranks will contain only one rook as a result of the arrangement of ''n'' rooks on the board, that is, the rooks do not attack each other.

=== The rook polynomial as a generalization of the rooks problem ===

The classical rooks problem immediately gives the value of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, the coefficient in front of the highest order term of the rook polynomial. Indeed, its result is that 8 non-attacking rooks can be arranged on an 8 × 8 chessboard in ''r''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = 8! = 40320 ways.

Let us generalize this problem by considering an ''m'' × ''n'' board, that is, a board with ''m'' ranks (rows) and ''n'' files (columns). The problem becomes: In how many ways can one arrange ''k'' rooks on an ''m'' × ''n'' board in such a way that they do not attack each other?

It is clear that for the problem to be solvable, ''k'' must be less or equal to the smaller of the numbers ''m'' and ''n''; otherwise one cannot avoid placing a pair of rooks on a rank or on a file. Let this condition be fulfilled. Then the arrangement of rooks can be carried out in two steps. First, choose the set of ''k'' ranks on which to place the rooks. Since the number of ranks is ''m'', of which ''k'' must be chosen, this choice can be done in &lt;math&gt;\binom{m}{k}&lt;/math&gt; ways. Similarly, the set of ''k'' files on which to place the rooks can be chosen in &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; ways. Because the choice of files does not depend on the choice of ranks, according to the products rule there are &lt;math&gt;\binom{m}{k}\binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; ways to choose the square on which to place the rook.

However, the task is not yet finished because ''k'' ranks and ''k'' files intersect in ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; squares. By deleting unused ranks and files and compacting the remaining ranks and files together, one obtains a new board of ''k'' ranks and ''k'' files. It was already shown that on such board ''k'' rooks can be arranged in ''k''! ways (so that they do not attack each other). Therefore, the total number of possible non-attacking rooks arrangements is:&lt;ref&gt;Vilenkin, Naum Ya. Combinatorics (Kombinatorika). 1969. Nauka Publishers, Moscow (In Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_k = \binom{m}{k}\binom{n}{k} k! = \frac{n! m!}{k! (n-k)! (m-k)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, 3 rooks can be placed on a conventional chessboard (8 × 8) in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{8! 8!}{3!5!5!}} = 18,816&lt;/math&gt; ways. For ''k'' = ''m'' = ''n'', the above formula gives ''r&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''n''! that corresponds to the result obtained for the classical rooks problem.

The rook polynomial with explicit coefficients is now:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{m,n}(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\min(m,n)} \binom{m}{k} \binom{n}{k} k! x^k = \sum_{k=0}^{\min(m,n)}\frac{n! m!}{k! (n-k)! (m-k)!} x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

If the limitation "rooks must not attack each other" is removed, one must choose any ''k'' squares from ''m'' × ''n'' squares. This can be done in:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{mn}{k} = \frac{(mn)!}{k! (mn-k)!}&lt;/math&gt;  ways.

If the ''k'' rooks differ in some way from each other, e.g., they are labelled or numbered, all the results obtained so far must be multiplied by ''k''!, the number of permutations of ''k'' rooks.

=== Symmetric arrangements ===
As a further complication to the rooks problem, let us require that rooks not only be non-attacking but also symmetrically arranged on the board. Depending on the type of symmetry, this is equivalent to rotating or reflecting the board. 
Symmetric arrangements lead to many problems, depending on the symmetry condition.&lt;ref&gt;Vilenkin, Naum Ya. Popular Combinatorics (Populyarnaya kombinatorika). 1975.

| '''Fig. 2.''' A symmetric arrangement of non-attacking rooks about the centre of an 8 × 8 chessboard. Dots mark the 4 central squares that surround the centre of symmetry.
}}
The simplest of those arrangements is when rooks are symmetric about the centre of the board. Let us designate with ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' the number of arrangements in which ''n'' rooks are placed on a board with ''n'' ranks and ''n'' files. Now let us make the board to contain 2''n'' ranks and 2''n'' files. A rook on the first file can be placed on any of the 2''n'' squares of that file. According to the symmetry condition, placement of this rook defines the placement of the rook that stands on the last file − it must be arranged symmetrically to the first rook about the board centre. Let us remove the first and the last files and the ranks that are occupied by rooks (since the number of ranks is even, the removed rooks cannot stand on the same rank). This will give a board of 2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 files and 2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 ranks. It is clear that to each symmetric arrangement of rooks on the new board corresponds a symmetric arrangement of rooks on the original board. Therefore, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''nG''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the factor 2''n'' in this expression comes from the possibility for the first rook to occupy any of the 2''n'' squares on the first file). By iterating the above formula one reaches to the case of a 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2 board, on which there are 2 symmetric arrangements (on the diagonals). As a result of this iteration, the final expression is ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''! For the usual chessboard (8&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;8), ''G''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;4! = 16&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;24 = 384 centrally symmetric arrangements of 8 rooks. One such arrangement is shown in Fig. 2.

For odd-sized boards (containing 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ranks and 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 files) there is always a square that does not have its symmetric double − this is the central square of the board. There must always be a rook placed on this square.  Removing the central file and rank, one obtains a symmetric arrangement of 2''n'' rooks on a 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2''n'' board. Therefore, for such board, once again ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''!

A little more complicated problem is to find the number of non-attacking arrangements that do not change upon 90° rotation of the board. Let the board has 4''n'' files and 4''n'' ranks, and the number of rooks is also 4''n''. In this case, the rook that is on the first file can occupy any square on this file, except the corner squares (a rook cannot be on a corner square because after a 90° rotation there would 2 rooks that attack each other). There are another 3 rooks that correspond to that rook and they stand, respectively, on the last rank, the last file, and the first rank (they are obtained from the first rook by 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations). Removing the files and ranks of those rooks, one obtains the rook arrangements for a (4''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(4''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4) board with the required symmetry. Thus, the following [[recurrence relation]] is obtained: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;4''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (4''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)''R''&lt;sub&gt;4''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of arrangements for a ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' board. Iterating, it follows that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;4''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''n''(2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)(2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3)...1. The number of arrangements for a (4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) board is the same as that for a 4''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;4''n'' board; this is because on a (4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) board, one rook must necessarily stand in the centre and thus the central rank and file can be removed. Therefore ''R''&lt;sub&gt;4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;4''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. For the traditional chessboard (''n'' = 2), ''R''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;1 = 12 possible arrangements with rotational symmetry.

For (4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) and (4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3) boards, the number of solutions is zero. Two cases are possible for each rook: either it stands in the centre or it doesn't stand in the centre. In the second case, this rook is included in the rook quartet that exchanges squares on turning the board at 90°. Therefore, the total number of rooks must be either 4''n'' (when there is no central square on the board) or 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. This proves that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

The number of arrangements of ''n'' non-attacking rooks symmetric to one of the diagonals (for determinacy, the diagonal corresponding to a1–h8 on the chessboard) on a ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' board is given by the [[Telephone number (mathematics)|telephone numbers]] defined by the recurrence ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; + (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This recurrence is derived in the following way. Note that the rook on the first file either stands on the bottom corner square or it stands on another square. In the first case, removal of the first file and the first rank leads to the symmetric arrangement ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 rooks on a (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) board. The number of such arrangements is ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In the second case, for the original rook there is another rook, symmetric to the first one about the chosen diagonal. Removing the files and ranks of those rooks leads to a symmetric arrangement ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 rooks on a (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2) board. Since the number of such arrangements is ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the rook can be put on the ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 square of the first file, there are (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt; ways for doing this, which immediately gives the above recurrence. The number of diagonal-symmetric arrangements is then given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_n = 1 + \binom{n}{2} + \frac{1}{1 \times 2}\binom{n}{2}\binom{n-2}{2} + \frac{1}{1 \times 2 \times 3}\binom{n}{2}\binom{n-2}{2}\binom{n-4}{2} + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is derived by partitioning all rook arrangements in classes; in class ''s'' are those arrangements in which ''s'' pairs of rooks do not stand on the diagonal. In exactly the same way, it can be shown that the number of ''n''-rook arrangements on a ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' board, such that they do not attack each other and are symmetric to both diagonals is given by the recurrence equations ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt; + (2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Arrangements counted by symmetry classes ===

A different type of generalization is that in which rook arrangements that are obtained from each other by symmetries of the board are counted as one.  For instance, if rotating the board by 90 degrees is allowed as a symmetry, then any arrangement obtained by a rotation of 90, 180, or 270 degrees is considered to be "the same" as the original pattern, even though these arrangements are counted separately in the original problem where the board is fixed.  For such problems, Dudeney&lt;ref&gt;Dudeney, Answer to Problem 295&lt;/ref&gt; observes: "How many ways there are if mere reversals and reflections are not counted as different has not yet been determined; it is a difficult problem." The problem reduces to that of counting symmetric arrangements via [[Burnside's lemma]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3968">In [[mathematics]], a '''sequence transformation''' is an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] acting on a given space of [[sequence]]s (a [[sequence space]]). Sequence transformations include linear mappings such as [[convolution]] with another sequence, and [[resummation]] of a [[sequence]] and, more generally, are commonly used for [[series acceleration]], that is, for improving the [[rate of convergence]] of a slowly convergent [[sequence]] or [[series (mathematics)|series]]. Sequence transformations are also commonly used to compute the  [[antilimit]] of a [[divergent series]] numerically, and are used in conjunction with [[extrapolation methods]].

==Overview==
Classical examples for sequence transformations include the [[binomial transform]], [[Möbius transform]], [[Stirling transform]] and others.

==Definitions==
For a given sequence 

:&lt;math&gt;S=\{ s_n \}_{n\in\N},\,&lt;/math&gt;

the '''transformed sequence''' is 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}(S)=S'=\{ s'_n \}_{n\in\N},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the members of the transformed sequence are usually computed from some finite number of members of the original sequence, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;s_n' = T(s_n,s_{n+1},\dots,s_{n+k})&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; which often depends on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (cf. e.g. [[Binomial transform]]). In the simplest case, the &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;s'_n&lt;/math&gt; are [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s. More generally, they may be elements of some [[vector space]] or [[algebra]]. 

In the context of acceleration of convergence, the transformed sequence is said to '''converge faster''' than the original sequence if 

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{s'_n-\ell}{s_n-\ell} = 0&lt;/math&gt;  

where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the limit of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, assumed to be convergent. In this case, [[convergence acceleration]] is obtained. If the original sequence is [[Divergent sequence|divergent]], the sequence transformation acts as [[extrapolation method]] to the antilimit &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

If the mapping &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[linear]] in each of its arguments, i.e., for

:&lt;math&gt;s'_n=\sum_{m=0}^{k} c_m s_{n+m}&lt;/math&gt; 

for some constants &lt;math&gt;c_0,\dots,c_k&lt;/math&gt; (which may depend on ''n''), the sequence transformation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;  is called a '''linear sequence transformation'''. Sequence transformations that are not linear are called [[nonlinear sequence transformation]]s.

==Examples==
Simplest examples of (linear) sequence transformations include shifting all elements, &lt;math&gt;s'_n = s_{n+k}&lt;/math&gt; (resp. = 0 if ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0) for a fixed ''k'', and [[scalar multiplication]] of the sequence.

A little less trivial generalization would be the [[convolution#Discrete convolution|discrete convolution]] with a fixed sequence. A particularly basic form is the [[difference operator]], which is convolution with the sequence &lt;math&gt;(-1,1,0,\ldots),&lt;/math&gt; and is a discrete analog of the derivative. The [[binomial transform]] is another linear transformation of a still more general type.

An example of a nonlinear sequence transformation is [[Aitken's delta-squared process]], used to improve the [[rate of convergence]] of a slowly convergent sequence. An extended form of this is the [[Shanks transformation]]. The [[Möbius transform]] is also a nonlinear transformation, only possible for [[integer sequence]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4269">Given an [[DEVS#Atomic DEVS|atomic DEVS]] model, simulation algorithms are methods to generate the model's legal behaviors which are trajectories not to reach to illegal states. (see [[Behavior of DEVS]]). [[Simulation_Algorithms_for_Atomic_DEVS#References|[Zeigler84]]] originally introduced the algorithms that handle time variables related to ''lifespan'' &lt;math&gt;t_s \in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; and ''elapsed time'' &lt;math&gt;t_e\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; by introducing two other time variables, ''last event time'', &lt;math&gt;t_l\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''next event time'' &lt;math&gt; t_n\in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; with the following relations: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \, t_e = t - t_l &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\, t_s = t_n - t_l &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''current time''. And the ''remaining time'',

 &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\,t_r=t_s-t_e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; is equivalently computed as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\, t_r = t_n - t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;, apparently &lt;math&gt; t_r \in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the behavior of a given atomic DEVS model can be defined in two different views depending on the total state and the external transition function (refer to [[Behavior of DEVS]]), the simulation algorithms are also introduced in two different views as below.

== Common parts ==
Regardless of two different views of total states, algorithms for initialization and internal transition cases are commonly defined as below.

 DEVS-simulator
   variables:
     parent // parent coordinator
     &lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt;     // time of last event
     &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;     // time of next event
     &lt;math&gt;A=(X,Y,S,ta, \delta_{ext}, \delta_{int}, \lambda) &lt;/math&gt;// the associated [[DEVS#Atomic DEVS|Atomic DEVS]] model 
   when receive init-message(Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;
   when receive star-message(Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      if &lt;math&gt; t \ne t_n &lt;/math&gt; then
         error: bad synchronization;
      &lt;math&gt; y \leftarrow \lambda(s);&lt;/math&gt;
      send y-message(&lt;math&gt;y,t&lt;/math&gt;) to parent;
      &lt;math&gt; s \leftarrow \delta_{int}(s)&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;

== View 1: total states = states * elapsed times ==
As addressed in [[Behavior of Atomic DEVS]], when DEVS receives an input event, right calling &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, the last event time,&lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt; is set by the current time,&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, thus the elapsed time&lt;math&gt;t_e&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero because &lt;math&gt;t_e = t - t_l&lt;/math&gt;.

   when receive x-message(&lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      if &lt;math&gt;( t_l \le t &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t \le t_n )&lt;/math&gt; == false then
         error: bad synchronization;
      &lt;math&gt; s \leftarrow \delta_{ext}(s,t-t_l, x)&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;

==View 2: total states = states * lifespans * elapsed times==
Notice that as addressed in [[Behavior of Atomic DEVS]], depending on the value of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; return by &lt;math&gt; \delta_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, last event time,&lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt;, and next event time,&lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;,consequently, elapsed time, &lt;math&gt;t_e&lt;/math&gt;, and lifespan&lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;, are updated (if &lt;math&gt;b=1&lt;/math&gt;) or preserved (if &lt;math&gt;b=0&lt;/math&gt;).

   when receive x-message(&lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      if &lt;math&gt;( t_l \le t &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t \le t_n )&lt;/math&gt; == false then
         error: bad synchronization;
      &lt;math&gt; (s,b) \leftarrow \delta_{ext}(s, t-t_l, x)&lt;/math&gt;
      if &lt;math&gt; b = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then 
         &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
         &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;

It is defined as the minimal number of actors in a social network that need to be removed to disconnect the group. It is thus identical to the question of the node [[connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] of a given graph. The vertex-cut version of [[Menger's theorem]] also proves that the disconnection number is equivalent to a maximally sized group with a network in which every pair of persons has at least this number of separate paths between them. It is also useful to know that k-cohesive graphs (or k-components) are always a subgraph of a [[k-core]], although a k-core is not always k-cohesive. A k-core is simply a subgraph in which all nodes have at least k neighbors but it need not even be connected. The boundaries of [[structural endogamy]] in a kinship group are a special case of structural cohesion.

== Software ==

[http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/Cohesive_blocking Cohesive.blocking] is the R program for computing structural cohesion according to the Moody-White (2003) [[algorithm]]. This wiki site provides numerous examples and a tutorial for use with R.

== Examples ==
Some illustrative examples are presented in the gallery below:

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:RingNetwork.svg|The 6-node ring in the graph has connectivity-2 or a level 2 of structural cohesion because the removal of two nodes is needed to disconnect it.

Image:6n-graf.svg|The 6-node component (1-connected) has an embedded 2-component, nodes 1-5

Image:NetworkTopology-FullyConnected.png|A 6-node clique is a 5-component, structural cohesion 5
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Perceived cohesion ==
'''Perceived Cohesion Scale''' ('''PCS''') is a six item scale that is used to measure structural cohesion in groups. In 1990, Bollen and Hoyle used the PCS and applied it to a study of large groups which were used to assess the [[psychometric]] qualities of their scale.&lt;ref&gt;Chin, Wynne W., et al. [http://sgr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/30/6/751 Perceived Cohesion: A Conceptual and Empirical Examination: Adapting and Testing the Perceived Cohesion Scale in a Small-Group Setting.] 1999. Small Group Research 30(6):751-766.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61419">'''[[Molecular symmetry]]''' in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] describes the [[symmetry]] present in [[molecule]]s and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry. Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in the application of [[Quantum Mechanics]] in physics and chemistry, for example it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's properties, such as its [[molecular dipole moment|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[dipole]] moment and its allowed [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic transitions]] (based on [[selection rules]]), without doing the exact rigorous calculations (which, in some cases, may not even be possible). [[Group theory]] is the predominant framework for analyzing molecular symmetry.

Among all the molecular symmetries, diatomic molecules show some distinct features and they are relatively easier to analyze.

== Symmetry and group theory ==
The physical laws governing a system is generally written as a relation (equations, differential equations, integral equations etc.). An operation on the ingredients of this relation, which keeps the form of the relations invariant is called a symmetry transformation or a symmetry of the system.
* These [[symmetry]] operations can involve external or internal co-ordinates; giving rise to geometrical or internal symmetries. 
* These symmetry operations can be global or local; giving rise to global or gauge symmetries.
* These symmetry operations can be discrete or continuous.
Symmetry is a fundamentally important concept in quantum mechanics. It can predict conserved quantities and provide quantum numbers. It can predict degeneracies of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstate]]s and gives insights about the matrix elements of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] without calculating them. Rather than looking into individual symmetries, it is sometimes more convenient to look into the general relations between the symmetries. It turns out that [[Group theory]] is the most efficient way of doing this.

=== Groups ===
{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}
A&amp;nbsp;''group''&amp;nbsp;is a mathematical structure (usually denoted in the form (''G'',*)) consisting of a set&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;and a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;'*'&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes loosely called 'multiplication'), satisfying the following properties:
# '''&lt;u&gt;closure&lt;/u&gt;''': For every pair of elements &lt;math&gt;
x,y\in G
&lt;/math&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;''product''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;

x*y\in G
&lt;/math&gt;''.''
# '''&lt;u&gt;associativity&lt;/u&gt;''': For every&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;''G'', both (''x''*''y'')*''z''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''x''*(''y''*''z'') result with the same element in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp; ( in symbols, &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)\forall x,y,z\in G&lt;/math&gt;).
# '''&lt;u&gt;existence of identity&lt;/u&gt;''': There must be an element ( say&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;) in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;such that product any element of&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;make no change to the element ( in symbols,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
x*e=e*x=x;\forall x\in G&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;).
# '''&lt;u&gt;existence of inverse&lt;/u&gt;''': For each element (&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;) in&amp;nbsp;''G'', there must be an element&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;such that product of&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;is the identity element&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp; ( in symbols, for each &lt;math&gt;
x\in G
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\text{ }\exists \text{ }y\in G
&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
x*y=y*x=e
&lt;/math&gt;).
* In addition to the above four, if it so happens that &lt;math&gt;
\forall x,y\in G&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;
x*y=y*x
&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the operation in '''commutative,''' then the group is called an [[Abelian Group]]. Otherwise it is called a [[Non-abelian group|Non-Abelian Group]].

=== Groups, symmetry and conservation  ===
{{Main|Symmetry in quantum mechanics}}The set of all symmetry transformations of a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] has the structure of a group, with group multiplication equivalent to applying the transformations one after the other. The group elements can be represented as matrices, so that the group operation becomes the ordinary matrix multiplication. In quantum mechanics, the evolution of an arbitrary superposition of states are given by unitary operators, so each of the elements of the symmetry groups are unitary operators. Now any unitary operator can be expressed as the exponential of some [[Hermitian operator]] . So, the corresponding Hermitian operators are the '[[Generating set of a group|generators]]' of the [[symmetry group]]. These unitary transformations act on the Hamiltonian operator in some [[Hilbert space]] in a way that the Hamiltonian remains invariant under the transformations. In other words, the symmetry operators commute with the Hamiltonian. If &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[Unitary operator|unitary symmetry operator]] and acts on the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then;

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;[H,U]=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; {H}'={{U}^{\dagger }}HU=H \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow HU=UH \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow [H,U]=0;\forall U\in G \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

These operators have the above-mentioned properties of a group: 
* The symmetry operations are closed under multiplication. 
* Application of symmetry transformations are associative.
* There is always a trivial transformation, where nothing is done to the original co-ordinates. This is the identity element of the group. 
* And as long as an inverse transformation exists, it is a symmetry transformation, i.e. it leaves the Hamiltonian invariant. Thus the inverse is part of this set. 
So, by the symmetry of a system, we mean a set of operators, each of which [[commutator|commutes]] with the Hamiltonian, and they form a [[symmetry group]]. This group may be Abelian or Non-Abelian. Depending upon which one it is, the properties of the system changes (for example, if the group is Abelian, there would be no [[Degeneracy (quantum mechanics)|degeneracy]]). Corresponding to every different kind of symmetry in a system, we can find a symmetry group associated with it.

It follows that the generator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of the symmetry group also commutes with the Hamiltonian. Now, it follows that:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! The observable corresponding to the generator Hermitian matrix, is conserved.
|-
| The derivative of the expectation value of the operator T can be written as:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=\frac{d\left\langle \Psi |T|\Psi  \right\rangle }{dt}=\left\langle \frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t}|T|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |T|\frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Now,

&lt;math&gt;i\hbar \frac{\partial \left| \Psi  \right\rangle }{\partial t}=H\left| \Psi  \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

So,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=-\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle \Psi |HT|\Psi  \right\rangle +\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle \Psi |TH|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

as H is also Hermitian. So we have,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle [H,T] \right\rangle +\left\langle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;[H,T]=0 &lt;/math&gt; as stated above, and if the operator T does not have any explicit time-dependence;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=0 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \left\langle T \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is a constant, independent of what the state &lt;math&gt;\left| \Psi  \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; may be.

So the observable corresponding to the operator T, is conserved.
|}
Some specific examples can be systems having [[Rotational symmetry|rotational]], [[translational invariance]] etc.. For a rotationally invariant system, The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the general rotation group. Now, if (say) the system is invariant about any rotation about Z-axis (i.e., the system has [[axial symmetry]]), then the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the group of rotation about the symmetry axis. Now, this group is generated by the Z-component of the orbital angular momentum, &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; (general group element &lt;math&gt;R(\alpha )={{e}^{\frac{-i\alpha {{L}_{z}}}{\hbar }}}
&lt;/math&gt;). Thus, &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; for this system and Z-component of the angular momentum is conserved. Similarly, translation symmetry gives rise to conservation of linear momentum, inversion symmetry gives rise to parity conservation and so on.

== Geometrical symmetries ==

=== Symmetry operations, point groups and permutation-inversion groups ===
{{Main|Molecular symmetry}}
A molecule at equilibrium in a certain electronic state usually has some geometrical symmetry.This symmetry is described by a certain [[point group]] which consists of operations (called symmetry operations) that produce a spatial orientation of the molecule that is indistinguishable from the starting configuration. There are five types of point group symmetry operation: identity, rotation, reflection, inversion and [[improper rotation]] or rotation-reflection. Common to all symmetry operations is that the geometrical center-point of the molecule does not change its position; hence the name [[point group]]. One  can determine the elements of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one uses a point group, the elements are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the elements rotate and/or reflect the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these elements commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H.C. | year = 1963 | title = The symmetry groups of non-rigid molecules | url = | journal = Molecular Physics | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 445–460 | doi = 10.1080/00268976300100501 | bibcode = 1963MolPh...6..445L }}&lt;/ref&gt;. See the Section "Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry" below, and [https://chemphys.ca/pbunker/PointGroupspdffile.html Link] 
.  The elements of permutation-inversion groups commute with the full molecular Hamiltonian. In addition to point groups, there exists another kind of group important in [[crystallography]], where translation in 3-D also needs to be taken care of. They are known as [[space group]]s.

=== Basic point group symmetry operations ===
The five basic symmetry operations mentioned above are:&lt;ref&gt;http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/script/redirect.cgi?filename=http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/tutorials/symmetry/index1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Identity Operation&amp;nbsp;E '''(from the German 'Einheit' meaning unity)''':'' '''''The identity operation leaves the molecule unchanged. It forms the identity element in the symmetry group. Though its inclusion seems to be trivial, it is important also because even for the most asymmetric molecule, this symmetry is present. The corresponding symmetry element is the entire molecule itself. 
# '''Inversion, ''i '': '''This operation inverts the molecule about its center of inversion (if it has any). The center of inversion is the symmetry element in this case. There may or may not be an atom at this center. A molecule may or may not have a center of inversion. For example: the benzene molecule, a cube, and spheres do have a center of inversion, whereas a tetrahedron does not.
# '''Reflection σ: '''The&amp;nbsp;reflection&amp;nbsp;operation produces a mirror image geometry of the molecule about a certain plane. The&amp;nbsp;mirror plane&amp;nbsp;bisects the molecule and must include its center of geometry. The plane of symmetry is the symmetry element in this case. A symmetry plane&amp;nbsp;parallel&amp;nbsp;with the principal axis (defined below)  is dubbed&amp;nbsp;vertical&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and one perpendicular to it horizontal&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). A third type of symmetry plane exists: If a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed&amp;nbsp;dihedral&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;).
# '''''n''-Fold Rotation&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;''''': '''''The&amp;nbsp;n-fold rotation&amp;nbsp;operation about a&amp;nbsp;n-fold axis of symmetry&amp;nbsp; produces molecular orientations indistinguishable from the initial for each rotation of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{{360}^{0}}}{n}&lt;/math&gt; (clockwise and counter-clockwise).It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The axis of symmetry is the symmetry element in this case. A molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;is called the&amp;nbsp;'''principal axis''', and by convention is assigned the z-axis in a&amp;nbsp;Cartesian coordinate system.
# '''''n''-Fold Rotation-Reflection&amp;nbsp;or improper rotation ''S&lt;sub&gt;n &lt;/sub&gt;: '''''The&amp;nbsp;n-fold improper rotation operation about an&amp;nbsp;n-fold axis of improper rotation is composed of two successive geometry transformations: first, a rotation through &lt;math&gt;
\frac{{{360}^{0}}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;about the axis of that rotation, and second, reflection through a plane perpendicular (and through the molecular center of geometry) to that axis. This axis is the symmetry element in this case. It is abbreviated S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.
It is to be noted that all other symmetry present in a specific molecule are a combination of these 5 operations.

=== Schoenflies notation ===
{{Main|Schoenflies notation}}
The&amp;nbsp;'''Schoenflies'''&amp;nbsp;(or&amp;nbsp;'''Schönflies''')&amp;nbsp;'''notation''', named after the&amp;nbsp;German&amp;nbsp;mathematician&amp;nbsp;[[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]], is one of two conventions commonly used to describe&amp;nbsp;point groups. This notation is used in&amp;nbsp;spectroscopy and is used here to specify a molecular point group.

== Point groups for diatomic molecules ==
{{Main|Molecular symmetry}}
There are two point groups for diatomic molecules: &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt; for heteronuclear diatomics, and &lt;math&gt;
{{D}_{\infty h}}
&lt;/math&gt; for homonuclear diatomics.
* &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt;:
The group &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;, contains rotations &lt;math&gt;
C(\phi )
&lt;/math&gt; through any angle &lt;math&gt;
\phi 
&lt;/math&gt; about the axis of symmetry and an infinite number of reflections &lt;math&gt;
{{\sigma }_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; through the planes containing the inter-nuclear axis (or the vertical axis, that is reason of the subscript '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''v''&lt;nowiki/&gt;').In the group &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt; all planes of symmetry are equivalent, so that all reflections &lt;math&gt;
{{\sigma }_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; form a single class with a continuous series of elements; the axis of symmetry is bilateral, so that there is a continuous series of classes, each containing two elements &lt;math&gt;
C(\pm \phi )
&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this group is '''''Non-abelian''''' and there exists an infinite number of irreducible representations in the group. The character table of the group is as follows:

{{D}_{\infty h}}&lt;/math&gt;:
In addition to axial reflection symmetry, [[Homonuclear molecule|homonuclear diatomic molecules]] are symmetric with respect to inversion or reflection through any axis in the plane passing through the point of symmetry and perpendicular to the inter-nuclear axis.[[File:Inversion2.png|thumb|350x300px|Inversion symmetry in homonuclear diatomic molecules, giving rise to symmetry group &lt;math&gt;

{{D}_{\infty h}}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from those of the group &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt; using the relation between the two groups: &lt;math&gt;
{{D}_{\infty h}}={{C}_{\infty v}}\times {{C}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. Like &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;math&gt;
{{D}_{\infty h}}&lt;/math&gt; is  '''''non-Abelian''''' and there are an infinite number of irreducible representations in the group.The character table of this group is as follows:

== Complete set of commuting operators ==
{{Main|Complete set of commuting observables}}
Unlike a single atom, the Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule doesn't commute with &lt;math&gt;{{L}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. So the quantum number &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is no longer a [[good quantum number]]. The internuclear axis chooses a specific direction in space and the potential is no longer spherically symmetric. Instead, &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{J}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (taking the arbitrary internuclear axis as the ''Z'' axis). But &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{x}},{{L}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; do not commute with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; due to the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule is invariant under rotations about the internuclear line (the ''Z'' axis), but not under rotations about the ''X'' or ''Y'' axes. Again, &lt;math&gt;{{S}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{S}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; act on a different Hilbert space, so they commute with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in this case also. The electronic Hamiltonian for a diatomic molecule is also invariant under reflections in all planes containing the internuclear line. The (''X-Z'') plane is such a plane, and reflection of the coordinates of the electrons in this plane corresponds to the operation &lt;math&gt;{{y}_{i}}\to -{{y}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; is the operator that performs this reflection, then &lt;math&gt;[{{A}_{y}},H]=0&lt;/math&gt;. So the [[Complete set of commuting observables|Complete Set of Commuting Operators]] (CSCO) for a general [[Heteronuclear molecule|heteronuclear diatomic molecule]] is &lt;math&gt;\{H,\text{ }{{J}_{z}},{{L}_{z}},{{S}^{2}},{{S}_{z}},A\}&lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an operator that inverts only one of the two spatial co-ordinates (''x or y). ''

In the special case of a homonuclear diatomic molecule, there is an extra symmetry since in addition to the axis of symmetry provided by the internuclear axis, there is a centre of symmetry at the midpoint of the distance between the two nuclei (the symmetry discussed in this paragraph only depends on the two nuclear charges being the same. The two nuclei can therefore have different mass, that is they can be two isotopes of the same species such as the proton and the deuteron, or &lt;math&gt;{{O}^{16}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{O}^{18}}&lt;/math&gt;, and so on). Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the Hamiltonian is invariant under an inversion of the coordinates of all electrons with respect to that origin, namely in the operation &lt;math&gt;{{\vec{r}}_{i}}\to -{{\vec{r}}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the parity operator &lt;math&gt;\Pi &lt;/math&gt;. Thus the CSCO for a homonuclear diatomic molecule is &lt;math&gt;\left\{ H,\text{ }{{J}_{z}},{{L}_{z}},{{S}^{2}},{{S}_{z}},A,\text{ }\Pi  \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==&lt;nowiki/&gt;Molecular term symbol, Λ-doubling ==
{{main|Molecular term symbol}}
'''[[Molecular term symbol]]'''&amp;nbsp;is a shorthand expression of the&amp;nbsp;group representation&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;angular momenta&amp;nbsp;that characterize the state of a&amp;nbsp;molecule. It is the equivalent of the&amp;nbsp;[[term symbol]]&amp;nbsp;for the atomic case. We already know the CSCO of the most general diatomic molecule. So, the [[good quantum number]]s can sufficiently describe the state of the diatomic molecule. Here, the symmetry is explicitly stated in the nomenclature.

=== Angular momentum ===

Here, the system is not spherically symmetric. So, &lt;math&gt;[H,{{L}^{2}}]\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, and the state cannot be depicted in terms of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; as an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is not an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;{{L}^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt; anymore (in contrast to the atomic term symbol, where the states were written as &lt;math&gt;^{2S+1}{{L}_{J}}&lt;/math&gt;). But, as &lt;math&gt;[H,{{L}_{z}}]= 0&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenvalues corresponding to &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; can still be used. If,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; {{L}_{z}}\left| \Psi  \right\rangle ={{M}_{L}}\hbar \left| \Psi  \right\rangle ;{{M}_{L}}=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,.......... \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow {{L}_{z}}\left| \Psi  \right\rangle =\pm \Lambda \hbar \left| \Psi  \right\rangle ;\Lambda =0,1,2,........... \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =\left| {{M}_{L}} \right|&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute value (in a.u.) of the projection of the total electronic angular momentum on the internuclear axis; &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; can be used as a term symbol. By analogy with the spectroscopic notation S, P, D, F, ... used for atoms, it is customary to associate code letters with the values of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; according to the correspondence:
[[File:term1.gif|center|300x300px]]

For the individual electrons, the notation and the correspondence used are:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda =\left| {{m}_{l}} \right|&lt;/math&gt; and
[[File:term2.gif|center|300x300px]]

=== Axial symmetry ===

Again, &lt;math&gt;[{{A}_{y}},H]=0&lt;/math&gt;, and in addition: &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}{{L}_{z}}=-{{L}_{z}}{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; [as &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}=-i\hbar (x\frac{\partial }{\partial y}-y\frac{\partial }{\partial x})&lt;/math&gt;]. It follows immediately that if &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; the action of the operator &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; on an eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \hbar&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; converts this state into another one corresponding to the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;-\Lambda \hbar&lt;/math&gt;, and that both eigenstates have the same energy. The electronic terms such that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the terms &lt;math&gt;\Pi ,\Delta ,\Phi ,................&lt;/math&gt;) are thus doubly degenerate, each value of the energy corresponding to two states which differ by the direction of the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the molecular axis. This twofold degeneracy is actually only approximate and it is possible to show that the interaction between the electronic and rotational motions leads to a splitting of the terms with &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; into two nearby levels, which is called &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;'''''-doubling'''''.&lt;ref name="Bransden"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;math&gt;\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; states. These states are non-degenerate, so that the states of a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; term can only be multiplied by a constant in a reflection through a plane containing the molecular axis. When &lt;math&gt;\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;, simultaneous eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{A}}_{{y}}&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed. Since &lt;math&gt;A_{y}^{2}=1&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;{{A}}_{{y}}&lt;/math&gt; have eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;. So to completely specify &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; states of diatomic molecules, &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{+}}&lt;/math&gt; states, which  is left unchanged upon reflection in a plane containing the nuclei, needs to be distinguished from &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{-}}&lt;/math&gt; states, for which it changes sign in performing that operation.

=== Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry ===

Homonuclear diatomic molecules have a center of symmetry at their midpoint. Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the electronic Hamiltonian is invariant under the point group operation '''''i''''' of inversion of the coordinates of all electrons at that origin. This operation is not the parity operation P (or E*); the parity operation involves the inversion of nuclear and electronic spatial coordinates at the molecular center of mass. Electronic states are either even, i.e. remain unchanged by the operation '''''i''''', or they are odd, i.e. changed in sign by '''''i'''''. The former are denoted by the subscript '''''g''''' and are called '''''gerade, '''''while the latter are denoted by the subscript '''''u''''' and are called '''''ungerade.''''' The subscripts '''''g''''' or '''''u''''' are therefore added to the term symbol, so that for homonuclear diatomic molecules we have &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }_{g}},{{\Sigma }_{u}},{{\Pi }_{g}},{{\Pi }_{u}},......&lt;/math&gt; electronic states. A homonuclear diatomic molecule has four non-degenerate &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; electronic states: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _{g}^{+},\Sigma _{g}^{-},\Sigma _{u}^{+},\Sigma _{u}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;. Vibronic states are classified according to the irreducible representations of the appropriate point group.

The complete Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule (as for all molecules) commutes with the parity operation P or E* and rovibronic energy levels (usually called rotational levels) can be given the parity symmetry label '''''+''''' or '''''-'''''. The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule also commutes with the operation
of permuting (or exchanging) the coordinates of the two (identical) nuclei and rotational levels 
gain the additional label '''''s''''' or '''''a''''' depending on whether the total wavefunction is
unchanged (symmetric) or changed in sign (antisymmetric) by the permutation operation. Thus, the rotational levels of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are labelled '''''+''''' or '''''-''''', whereas those of homonuclear diatomic
molecules are labelled '''''+s''''', '''''+a''''', '''''-s''''' or '''''-a'''''. The rovibronic nuclear spin states are classified using the appropriate permutation-inversion group.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Bunker and Per Jensen (2005), ''Fundamentals of Molecular Symmetry'' (Institute of Physics Publishing) {{ISBN|0-7503-0941-5}} Section 8.3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule (as for all centro-symmetric molecules)
does not commute with the point group inversion operation '''''i''''' because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian. The nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of '''''g''''' and '''''u''''' vibronic states (called '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' mixing) and give
rise to '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' transitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pique | first = J.

=== [[Spin (physics)|Spin]] and [[total angular momentum]] ===

If '''''S '''''denotes the resultant of the individual electron spins, &lt;math&gt;s(s+1){{\hbar }^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of '''''S '''''and as in the case of atoms, each electronic term of the molecule is also characterised by the value of '''''S'''''. If spin-orbit coupling is neglected, there is a degeneracy of order &lt;math&gt;2s+1&lt;/math&gt; associated with each &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; for a given &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;. Just as for atoms, the quantity &lt;math&gt;2s+1&lt;/math&gt; is called the multiplicity of the term and.is written as a (left) superscript, so that the term symbol is written as &lt;math&gt;{}^{2s+1}\Lambda &lt;/math&gt;. For example, the symbol &lt;math&gt;{}^{3}\Pi &lt;/math&gt;denotes a term such that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =2
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=1
&lt;/math&gt;. It is worth noting that the ground state (often labelled by the symbol &lt;math&gt;X
&lt;/math&gt;) of most diatomic molecules is such that &lt;math&gt;s=0
&lt;/math&gt; and exhibits maximum symmetry. Thus, in most cases it is a &lt;math&gt;{}^{1}{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; state (written as &lt;math&gt;X{}^{1}{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt;, excited states are written with &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,...&lt;/math&gt; in front) for a heteronuclear molecule and a &lt;math&gt;{}^{1}\Sigma _{g}^{+}
&lt;/math&gt; state (written as &lt;math&gt;X{}^{1}\Sigma _{g}^{+}
&lt;/math&gt;) for a homonuclear molecule.

Spin–orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of the electronic states. This is because the ''z''-component of spin interacts with the ''z''-component of the orbital angular momentum, generating a total electronic angular momentum along the molecule axis '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. This is characterized by the quantum number &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}={{M}_{S}}+{{M}_{L}}
&lt;/math&gt;. Again, positive and negative values of &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}
&lt;/math&gt; are degenerate, so the pairs (''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (−''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', −''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') are degenerate. These pairs are grouped together with the quantum number &lt;math&gt;\Omega

&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined as the sum of the pair of values (''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') for which ''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is positive: &lt;math&gt;\Omega =\Lambda +{{M}_{S}}

&lt;/math&gt;

=== Molecular term symbol ===

So, the overall molecular term symbol for the most general diatomic molecule is given by:

&lt;math&gt;{}^{2S+1}\!\Lambda^{(+/-)}_{\Omega,(g/u)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* '''''S '''''is the total spin quantum number
* &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis
* &lt;math&gt;\Omega

&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of the total angular momentum along the internuclear axis
* '''''u'''''/'''''g''''' is the effect of the point group operation '''''i'''''
* '''''+/&amp;#x2212;''''' is the reflection symmetry along an arbitrary plane containing the internuclear axis

=== Effect of symmetry on the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian ===
The electronic terms or potential curves &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{S}}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of a diatomic molecule depend only on the internuclear distance &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;, and it is important to investigate the behaviour of these potential curves as R varies.It is of considerable interest to examine the intersection of the curves representing the different terms.
[[File:wigner2014.png|thumb|258x258px|The non-crossing rule of von Neumann and Wigner. Two potential curves &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; cannot cross if the states 1 and 2 have the same point group symmetry]]
Let &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; two different electronic potential curves. If they intersect at some point, then the functions &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; will have neighbouring values near this point. To decide whether such an intersection can occur, it is convenient to put the problem as follows. Suppose at some internuclear distance &lt;math&gt;{{R}}_{{c}}
&lt;/math&gt; the values &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; are close, but distinct (as shown in the figure). Then it is to be examined whether or &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; can be made to intersect by the modification &lt;math&gt;{{R}_{C}}\to {{R}_{C}}+\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt;. The energies &lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}={{E}_{1}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}^{(0)}={{E}_{2}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; are eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{0}}=H({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding orthonormal electronic eigenstates will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and are assumed to be real.
The Hamiltonian now becomes &lt;math&gt;H\equiv H({{R}_{C}}+\Delta R)={{H}_{0}}+H'
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H'=\frac{\partial {{H}_{0}}}{\partial {{R}_{C}}}\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; is the small perturbation operator (though it is a degenerate case, so ordinary method of perturbation won't work). setting &lt;math&gt;H_{ij}^{'}=\left\langle \Phi _{i}^{(0)}|H'|\Phi _{j}^{(0)} \right\rangle ;i,j=1,2
&lt;/math&gt;, it can be deduced that in order for &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; to be equal at the point &lt;math&gt;{{R}_{C}}+\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; the following two conditions are required to be fulfilled:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'}=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|As an initial zero-order approximation, instead of &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; themselves, linear combinations of them of the form &lt;math&gt;\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle ={{c}_{1}}\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, can be taken as the [[eigenstate]] of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are, in general, complex). Substituting this expression in the perturbed  [[Schroedinger's equation|Schrödinger'''&amp;nbsp;''' equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;({{H}_{0}}+H')\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle =E\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Expanding:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking inner product with the respective bra's:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{1}^{(0)}|\Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{1}^{(0)}|\Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;; and

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{2}^{(0)}|\Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{2}^{(0)}|\Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;  are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;
{{H}_{0}}
&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to different [[eigenvalues]] and as &lt;math&gt;
{{H}_{0}}
&lt;/math&gt; is itself Hermitian, They are [[orthonormal]]: &lt;math&gt;
\left\langle \Phi _{i}^{(0)}|\Phi _{j}^{(0)} \right\rangle ={{\delta }_{ij}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-E)+{{c}_{2}}H_{12}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;; and

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}H_{21}^{'}+{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{22}^{'}-E)=0
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the operator &lt;math&gt;
H'
&lt;/math&gt; is Hermitian, the matrix elements &lt;math&gt;
H_{11}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
H_{22}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; are real, while &lt;math&gt;
H_{12}^{'}=H_{21}^{'*}
&lt;/math&gt;. The compatibility condition for these equations is (such that both &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are not simultaneously zero):

&lt;math&gt;
\left| \begin{matrix}
   E_{1}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-E &amp; H_{12}^{'}  \\
   H_{21}^{'} &amp; E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{22}^{'}-E  \\
\end{matrix} \right|=0
&lt;/math&gt;

This gives: &lt;math&gt;
E=\frac{1}{2}(E_{1}^{(0)}+E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}+H_{22}^{'})\pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}{{(E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'})}^{2}}+{{\left| H_{12}^{'} \right|}^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula gives the required eigenvalues of the energy in the first approximation.

If the energy values of the two terms become equal at the point &lt;math&gt;({{R}_{C}}+\Delta R)
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the terms intersect), this means that the two values of &lt;math&gt;E
&lt;/math&gt; given by formula, are the same. For this to happen, the expression under the radical must vanish. Since it is the sum of two squares, both are simultaneously zero. So, it gives the conditions:

&lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

'''''and '''''

&lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

However, we have at our disposal only one arbitrary parameter &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; giving the perturbation &lt;math&gt;H'
&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the

two conditions involving more than one parameter cannot in general be simultaneously satisfied (the initial assumption that &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; real, implies that &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; is also real). So, two case can arise:&amp;nbsp;
# The matrix element &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; vanishes identically. It is then possible to satisfy the first condition independently. Therefore, it is possible for the crossing to occur if, for a certain value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., for a certain value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;) the first equation is satisfied. As the perturbation operator &lt;math&gt;H'
&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;H
&lt;/math&gt;) commutes with the symmetry operators of the molecule, this case will happen if the two electronic states &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;  have different point group symmetries (for example if they correspond to two electronic terms having different values of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;, different electronic parities '''''g''''' and '''''u''''', different multiplicities, or for example are the two terms &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{-}}
&lt;/math&gt; ) as it can be shown that, for a scalar quantity whose operator commutes with the angular momentum and inversion operators, only the matrix elements for transitions between states of the same angular momentum and parity are non-zero and the proof remains valid, in essentially the same form, for the general case of an arbitrary symmetry operator. &amp;nbsp;
# If  the electronic states &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; have the same point group symmetry, then &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; can be, and will in general be, non-zero. Except for accidental crossing which would occur if, by coincidence, the two equations were satisfied at the same value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;, it is in general impossible to find a single value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a single value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;)  for which the two conditions are satisfied simultaneously. &amp;nbsp;
Thus, in a diatomic molecule, only terms of different symmetry can intersect, while the intersection of terms of like symmetry is forbidden. This is, in general, true for any case in quantum mechanics where the Hamiltonian contains some parameter and its eigenvalues are consequently functions of that parameter. This general rule is known as '''[[von Neumann]] - [[Wigner]] non-crossing rule. '''
{{#tag:ref| This follows from a more general rule of group theory.

This general symmetry principle has important consequences is molecular spectra.
In fact, in the applications of [[Valence bond theory|valence bond method]] in case of diatomic molecules, three main correspondence between the [[Atomic orbital|atomic]] and the [[molecular orbitals]] are taken care of:
# Molecular orbitals having a given value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; (the component of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis) must connect with atomic orbitals having the same value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the same value of &lt;math&gt;\left| m \right|&lt;/math&gt;).
# The electronic parity of the wave function (''g'' or ''u'') must be preserved as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
# The von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule must be obeyed, so that energy curves corresponding to orbitals having the same symmetry do not cross as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule also acts as a starting point for valence bond theory.

== Observable consequences==
Symmetry in diatomic molecules manifests itself directly by influencing the molecular [[Spectral line|spectra]] of the molecule. The effect of symmetry on different types of spectra in diatomic molecules are:

=== [[Rotational spectrum]] ===
In the electric dipole approximation the transition amplitude for emission or absorption of radiation can be shown to be proportional to the vibronic matrix element of the component of the [[electric dipole]] operator &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; along the molecular axis. This is the permanent electric dipole moment.
In homonuclear diatomic molecules, the permanent electric dipole moment vanishes and there is no pure rotation spectrum.
Heteronuclear diatomic molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment and exhibit spectra corresponding to rotational transitions, without change in the vibronic state. For &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =0 &lt;/math&gt;, the selection rules for a rotational transition are: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \Delta \Im =\pm 1 \\ 
 &amp; \Delta {{M}_{\Im }}=0,\pm 1 \\ 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the selection rules become: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \Delta \Im =0,\pm 1 \\ 
 &amp; \Delta {{M}_{\Im }}=0,\pm 1 \\ 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;.This is due to the fact that although the photon absorbed or emitted carries one unit of angular momentum, the nuclear rotation can change, with no change in &lt;math&gt;\Im  &lt;/math&gt;, if the electronic angular momentum makes an equal and opposite change. Symmetry considerations require that the electric dipole moment of a diatomic molecule is directed along the internuclear line, and this leads to the additional selection rule &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Lambda =0 &lt;/math&gt;.The pure rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule consists of lines in the far infra-red or the microwave region, the frequencies of these lines given by:

&lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }_{\Im +1,\Im }}={{E}_{r}}(\Im +1)-{{E}_{r}}(\Im )=2B(\Im +1) &lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;B=\frac{{{\hbar }^{2}}}{2\mu R_{0}^{2}} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Im \ge \Lambda  &lt;/math&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;N.B.&lt;/u&gt;''' In exceptional circumstances the hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of '''''g''''' and '''''u''''' vibronic states of homonuclear diatomic molecules giving rise to pure rotational ('''''ortho''''' - '''''para''''') transitions in a homonuclear diatomic molecule.&lt;ref name=Critchley2001/&gt;

=== [[Vibrational spectrum]] ===
The transition matrix elements for pure vibrational transition are &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}}=\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu 
 &lt;/math&gt; is the dipole moment of the diatomic molecule in the electronic state &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;. Because the dipole moment depends on the bond length &lt;math&gt;R &lt;/math&gt;, its variation with displacement of the nuclei from equilibrium can be expressed as: &lt;math&gt;\mu ={{\mu }_{0}}+{{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}x+\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}{{x}^{2}}+....... &lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{0}} &lt;/math&gt; is the dipole moment when the displacement is zero. The transition matrix elements are, therefore: &lt;math&gt;\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle ={{\mu }_{0}}\left\langle v'|v \right\rangle +{{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle +\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|{{x}^{2}}|v \right\rangle +.......={{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle +\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|{{x}^{2}}|v \right\rangle +....... &lt;/math&gt;using orthogonality of the states. So, the transition matrix is non-zero only if the molecular dipole moment varies with displacement, for otherwise the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt;/math&gt; would be zero. The gross selection rule for the vibrational transitions of diatomic molecules is then: ''To show a vibrational spectrum, a diatomic molecule must have a dipole moment that varies with extension. So, ''homonuclear diatomic molecules do not undergo electric-dipole vibrational transitions. So, a homonuclear diatomic molecule doesn't show purely vibrational spectra.

For small displacements, the electric dipole moment of a molecule can be expected to vary linearly with the extension of the bond. This would be the case for a heteronuclear molecule in which the partial charges on the two atoms were independent of the internuclear distance. In such cases (known as harmonic approximation), the quadratic and higher terms in the expansion can be ignored and &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}}=\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle ={{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;. Now, the matrix elements can be expressed in position basis in terms of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions: Hermite polynomials. Using the property of Hermite polynomials: &lt;math&gt;2(\alpha x){{H}_{v}}(\alpha x)=2v{{H}_{v-1}}(\alpha x)+{{H}_{v+1}}(\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;, it is evident that &lt;math&gt;x\left| v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;x{{H}_{v}}(\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;, produces two terms, one proportional to &lt;math&gt;\left| v+1 \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; and the other to &lt;math&gt;\left| v-1 \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;. So, the only non-zero contributions to &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}} &lt;/math&gt; comes from &lt;math&gt;v'=v\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;. So, the selection rule for heteronuclear diatomic molecules is: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v=\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;''' Homonuclear diatomic molecules show no pure vibrational spectral lines, and the vibrational spectral lines of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are governed by the above-mentioned selection rule.

=== [[Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy|Rovibrational spectrum]] ===
{{main|Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy}}
Homonuclear diatomic molecules show neither pure vibrational nor pure rotational spectra. However, as the absorption of a [[photon]] requires the molecule to take up one unit of [[angular momentum]], vibrational transitions are accompanied by a change in rotational state, which is subject to the same selection rules as for the pure rotational spectrum. For a molecule in a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; state, the transitions between two vibration-rotation (or ''rovibrational'') levels &lt;math&gt;(v,\Im )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(v',\Im' )&lt;/math&gt;, with vibrational quantum numbers &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v' = v + 1&lt;/math&gt;, fall into two sets according to whether &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =+1&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =-1&lt;/math&gt;. The set corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =+1&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''R branch'''''. The corresponding frequencies are given by: &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{R}}=E(v+1,\Im +1)-E(v,\Im )=2B(\Im +1)+\hbar {{\omega }_{0}};\text{ }\Im =0,1,2,......&lt;/math&gt;

The set corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =-1&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''P branch'''''. The corresponding frequencies are given by:  &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{P}}=E(v+1,\Im -1)-E(v,\Im )=-2B\Im +\hbar {{\omega }_{0}};\text{ }\Im =1,2,3,......&lt;/math&gt;

Both branches make up what is called a ''rotational-vibrational band or a rovibrational band''. These bands are in the [[infra-red]] part of the spectrum.

If the molecule is not in a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; state, so that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;, transitions with &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =0&lt;/math&gt; are allowed. This gives rise to a further branch of the vibrational-rotational spectrum, called the '''''Q branch'''''. The frequencies &lt;math&gt;{{\omega }^{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the lines in this branch are given by a quadratic function of &lt;math&gt;\Im 
&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v+1}}&lt;/math&gt; are unequal, and reduce to the single frequency: &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{Q}}=E(v+1,\Im )-E(v,\Im )=\hbar {{\omega }_{0}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v+1}}={{B}_{v}}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, this selection rule has two consequences:  
# Both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers must change. The Q-branch is therefore forbidden.
# The energy change of rotation can be either subtracted from or added to the energy change of vibration, giving the P- and R- branches of the spectrum, respectively.
Homonuclear diatomic molecules also show this kind of spectra. The selection rules, however, are a bit different.
* '''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;''' Both homo- and hetero-nuclear diatomic molecules show rovibrational spectra. A Q-branch is absent in the spectra of heteronuclear diatomic molecules.

== A special example: Hydrogen molecule ion  ==
{{Main|Dihydrogen cation}}An explicit implication of symmetry on the molecular structure can be shown in case of the simplest bi-nuclear system: a hydrogen molecule ion or a di-hydrogen cation, &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;. A natural trial wave function for the &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by first considering the lowest-energy state of the system when the two protons are widely separated. Then there are clearly two possible states: the electron is attached either to one of the protons, forming a hydrogen atom in the [[ground state]], or the electron is attached to the other proton, again in the ground state of a hydrogen atom (as depicted in the picture). 
[[File:Two possible initial states of the system.png|thumb|484x484px|Two possible initial states of the system]]
The trial states in the position basis (or the '[[wave functions]]') are then:

&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{1} \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}{{e}^{-\frac{\left| \mathbf{r}-\frac{\mathbf{R}}{2} \right|}{{{a}_{0}}}}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{2} \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}{{e}^{-\frac{\left| \mathbf{r}+\frac{\mathbf{R}}{2} \right|}{{{a}_{0}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The analysis of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; using variational method starts assuming these forms. Again, this is only one possible combination of states. There can be other combination of states also, for example, the electron is in an excited state of the hydrogen atom. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the system is:

&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, using the states &lt;math&gt;\left| 1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| 2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; as basis will introduce off-diagonal elements in the Hamiltonian. Here, because of the relative simplicity of the &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; ion, the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix elements]] can actually be calculated. The electronic Hamiltonian of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the  point group inversion symmetry operation '''''i'''''. Using its symmetry properties, we can relate the [[Diagonal matrix|diagonal]] and off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian as:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}\text{ and }{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| The diagonal terms:
&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}=\left\langle 1|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle -\left\langle 1|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 1|1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{11}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{11}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}} &lt;/math&gt;is the ground-state energy of the hydrogen atom.

Again,&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{22}}=\left\langle 2|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle -\left\langle 2|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 2|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{22}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|2 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}={{H}_{11}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the last step follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt;{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|2 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}={{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}=\frac{1}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}&lt;/math&gt; and from the symmetry of the system, the value of the integrals are same.

Now the off-diagonal terms:

&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{12}}=\left\langle 1|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle -\left\langle 1|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{12}}=({{E}_{1}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R})\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle -\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}\left\langle 1\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

by inserting a complete set of states &lt;math&gt;\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|&lt;/math&gt; in the last term. &lt;math&gt;\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle =\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\left\langle 1\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is called the 'overlap integral'

And,

&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{21}}=\left\langle 2|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle -\left\langle 2|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 2|1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{21}}=({{E}_{1}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R})\left\langle 2|1 \right\rangle -\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}\left\langle 2\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|1 \right\rangle ={{H}_{12}}&lt;/math&gt; (as the wave functions are real)

So, &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}\text{ and }{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;

|}
Because &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;, the linear combination of &lt;math&gt;\left| 1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt;\left| 2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; that [[Diagonalized|diagonalizes]] the Hamiltonian is &lt;math&gt;\left| \pm  \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pm 2\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle }}(\left| 1 \right\rangle \pm \left| 2 \right\rangle )&lt;/math&gt; (after normalization). Now as &lt;math&gt;[H,&lt;/math&gt;'''''i'''''&lt;math&gt;]=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;, the states &lt;math&gt;\left| \pm  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are also eigenstates of '''''i'''''. It turns out that &lt;math&gt;\left| +  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| -  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenstates of '''''i''''' with eigenvalues +1 and -1 (in other words, the wave functions &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|+ \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|- \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; are gerade (symmetric) and ungerade (unsymmetric), respectively). The corresponding expectation value of the energies are &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{\pm }}=\frac{1}{1\pm \left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle }({{H}_{11}}\pm {{H}_{12}})&lt;/math&gt;. [[File:H2plus figure 2.png|center|thumb|600x484px|The energy vs separation graphs of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;. The two lowest curves denote the &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{-}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; states respectively. Higher ones are the excited states. The minimum of &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to an energy &lt;math&gt;-15.4 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;]]

From the graph, we see that only &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum corresponding to a separation of 1.3 &amp;Aring; and a total energy &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}=-15.4 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;, which is less than the initial energy of the system, &lt;math&gt;-13.6 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, only the gerade state stabilizes the ion with a [[binding energy]] of &lt;math&gt;1.8 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the ground state of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;{{X}^{2}}\Sigma _{g}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; and this state &lt;math&gt;\left( \left| +  \right\rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a bonding molecular orbital.&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{Cite book

Thus, symmetry plays an explicit role in the formation of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|right|thumb|300px|Bi-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]]]]

'''Two-dimensional space''' (also known as '''[[bi-dimensional space]]''') is a geometric setting in which two values (called [[parameter]]s) are required to determine the position of an element (i.e., [[Point (mathematics)|point]]). In [[Mathematics]], it is commonly represented by the symbol {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For a generalization of the concept, see [[dimension]].

Two-dimensional space can be seen as a projection of the physical [[universe]] onto a [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. Usually, it is thought of as a [[Euclidean space]] and the two dimensions are called length and width.

==History==
Books I through IV and VI of [[Euclid's Elements]] dealt with two-dimensional geometry, developing such notions as similarity of shapes, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] (Proposition 47), equality of angles and [[area]]s, parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the three cases in which triangles are "equal" (have the same area), among many other topics.

Later, the plane was described in a so-called ''[[Cartesian coordinate system]]'', a [[coordinate system]] that specifies each [[point (geometry)|point]] uniquely in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] by a pair of [[number|numerical]] ''coordinates'', which are the [[positive and negative numbers|signed]] distances from the point to two fixed [[perpendicular]] directed lines, measured in the same [[unit length|unit of length]]. Each reference line is called a ''coordinate axis'' or just ''axis'' of the system, and the point where they meet is its ''[[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]'', usually at ordered pair (0,&amp;#8239;0). The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the [[orthogonal projection|perpendicular projections]] of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.

The idea of this system was developed in 1637 in writings by Descartes and independently by [[Pierre de Fermat]], although Fermat also worked in three dimensions, and did not publish the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Analytic geometry|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2008|edition=Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both authors used a single axis in their treatments and have a variable length measured in reference to this axis. The concept of using a pair of axes was introduced later, after Descartes' ''[[La Géométrie]]'' was translated into Latin in 1649 by [[Frans van Schooten]] and his students. These commentators  introduced several concepts while trying to clarify the ideas contained in Descartes' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burton|2011|loc=p. 374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the plane was thought of as a [[field (mathematics)|field]], where any two points could be multiplied and, except for 0, divided. This was known as the [[complex plane]]. The complex plane is sometimes called the Argand plane because it is used in Argand diagrams. These are named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]] (1768–1822), although they were first described by Danish-Norwegian land surveyor and mathematician [[Caspar Wessel]] (1745–1818).&lt;ref&gt;Wessel's memoir was presented to the Danish Academy in 1797; Argand's paper was published in 1806. (Whittaker &amp; Watson, 1927, p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeroes]] of a [[mathematical function|function]] in the complex plane.

===Coordinate systems===
&lt;!-- now correct: if a sphere included, then there is no unique 2d space --&gt;
{{further|Coordinate system}}
{{distinguish-redirect|Plane coordinates|Coordinate plane}}

In mathematics, [[analytic geometry]] (also called Cartesian geometry) describes every point in two-dimensional space by means of two coordinates.  Two perpendicular [[coordinate axis|coordinate axes]] are given which cross each other at the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]].  They are usually labeled ''x'' and ''y''. Relative to these axes, the position of any point in two-dimensional space is given by an ordered pair of real numbers, each number giving the distance of that point from the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] measured along the given axis, which is equal to the distance of that point from the other axis.

Another widely used coordinate system is the [[polar coordinate system]], which specifies a point in terms of its distance from the origin and its angle relative to a rightward reference ray.

===Polytopes===
{{main article|Polygon}}
In two dimensions, there are infinitely many polytopes: the polygons. The first few regular ones are shown below:

====Convex====
The [[Schläfli symbol]] {p} represents a [[Regular polygon|regular ''p''-gon]].

====Degenerate (spherical)====
The regular [[henagon]] {1} and regular [[digon]] {2} can be considered degenerate regular polygons. They can exist nondegenerately in non-Euclidean spaces like on a [[sphere|2-sphere]] or a [[torus|2-torus]].

====Non-convex====
There exist infinitely many non-convex regular polytopes in two dimensions, whose Schläfli symbols consist of rational numbers {n/m}. They are called [[star polygon]]s and share the same [[vertex arrangement]]s of the convex regular polygons.

In general, for any natural number n, there are n-pointed non-convex regular polygonal stars with Schläfli symbols {''n''/''m''} for all ''m'' such that ''m'' &lt; ''n''/2 (strictly speaking {''n''/''m''} = {''n''/(''n'' − ''m'')}) and ''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]].

===Circle===
{{main article|Circle}}
[[File:CIRCLE 1.svg|200px|right]]
The [[hypersphere]] in 2 dimensions is a [[circle]], sometimes called a 1-sphere (''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) because it is a one-dimensional [[manifold]]. In a Euclidean plane, it has the length 2&amp;pi;''r'' and the [[area]] of its [[interior (topology)|interior]] is
:&lt;math&gt;A = \pi r^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius.

===Other shapes===
{{Main article| List of two-dimensional geometric shapes}}

There are an infinitude of other curved shapes in two dimensions, notably including the [[conic section]]s: the [[ellipse]], the [[parabola]], and the [[hyperbola]].

==In linear algebra==
Another mathematical way of viewing two-dimensional space is found in [[linear algebra]], where the idea of independence is crucial.  The plane has two dimensions because the length of a [[rectangle]] is independent of its width.  In the technical language of linear algebra, the plane is two-dimensional because every point in the plane can be described by a linear combination of two independent [[coordinate vector|vector]]s.

===Dot product, angle, and length===
{{main article|Dot product}}
The dot product of two vectors {{nowrap|1='''A''' = [''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]}} and {{nowrap|1='''B''' = [''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]}} is defined as:&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=S. Lipschutz |author2=M. Lipson |title= Linear Algebra (Schaum’s Outlines)|edition= 4th |year= 2009|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-154352-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{B} = A_1B_1 + A_2B_2&lt;/math&gt;

A vector can be pictured as an arrow.  Its magnitude is its length, and its direction is the direction the arrow points.  The magnitude of a vector '''A''' is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf{A}\|&lt;/math&gt;.  In this viewpoint, the dot product of two Euclidean vectors '''A''' and '''B''' is defined by&lt;ref name="Spiegel2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=M.R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipschutz |author3=D. Spellman |title= Vector Analysis (Schaum’s Outlines)|edition= 2nd |year= 2009|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A\cdot\mathbf B = \|\mathbf A\|\,\|\mathbf B\|\cos\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
where θ is the [[angle]] between '''A''' and '''B'''.

The dot product of a vector '''A''' by itself is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A\cdot\mathbf A = \|\mathbf A\|^2,&lt;/math&gt;
which gives
: &lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf A\| = \sqrt{\mathbf A\cdot\mathbf A},&lt;/math&gt;
the formula for the [[Euclidean length]] of the vector.

==In calculus==

===Gradient===
In a rectangular coordinate system, the gradient is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} +
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}  \mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;

===Line integrals and double integrals===
For some [[scalar field]] ''f'' : ''U'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''', the line integral along a [[piecewise smooth]] [[curve]] ''C'' ⊂  ''U'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_C f\, ds = \int_a^b f(\mathbf{r}(t)) |\mathbf{r}'(t)|\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;
where '''r''': [a, b] → ''C'' is an arbitrary [[bijective]] [[parametric equation|parametrization]] of the curve ''C'' such that '''r'''(''a'') and '''r'''(''b'') give the endpoints of ''C'' and &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;.

For a [[vector field]] '''F''' : ''U'' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;, the line integral along a [[piecewise smooth]] [[curve]] ''C'' ⊂ ''U'', in the direction of '''r''', is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_C \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})\cdot\,d\mathbf{r} = \int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t))\cdot\mathbf{r}'(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

where · is the [[dot product]] and '''r''': [a, b] → ''C'' is a [[bijective]] [[parametric equation|parametrization]] of the curve ''C'' such that '''r'''(''a'') and '''r'''(''b'') give the endpoints of ''C''.

A [[double integral]] refers to an [[integral]] within a region ''D'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x,y),&lt;/math&gt; and is usually written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\iint\limits_D f(x,y)\,dx\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

===Fundamental theorem of line integrals===
{{main article|Fundamental theorem of line integrals}}
The [[fundamental theorem of line integrals]] says that a [[line integral]] through a [[gradient]] field can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve.

Let &lt;math&gt; \varphi : U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \varphi\left(\mathbf{q}\right)-\varphi\left(\mathbf{p}\right) = \int_{\gamma[\mathbf{p},\,\mathbf{q}]} \nabla\varphi(\mathbf{r})\cdot d\mathbf{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Green's theorem===
{{main article|Green's theorem}}
Let ''C'' be a positively [[Curve orientation|oriented]], [[piecewise smooth]], [[simple closed curve]] in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], and let ''D'' be the region bounded by ''C''. If ''L'' and ''M'' are functions of (''x'', ''y'') defined on an [[Open set|open region]] containing ''D'' and have [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[partial derivatives]] there, then&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical methods for physics and engineering, K.F. Riley, M.P. Hobson, S.J. Bence, Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{isbn|978-0-521-86153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vector Analysis (2nd Edition), M.R. Spiegel, S. Lipschutz, D. Spellman, Schaum’s Outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 2009, {{isbn|978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{C} (L\, dx + M\, dy) = \iint_{D} \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\right)\, dx\, dy&lt;/math&gt;

where the path of integration along C is [[counterclockwise]].

==In topology==
In [[topology]], the plane is characterized as being the unique [[contractible]] [[2-manifold]].

Its dimension is characterized by the fact that removing a point from the plane leaves a space that is connected, but not [[simply connected]].

==In graph theory==
In [[graph theory]], a [[planar graph]] is a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that can be [[graph embedding|embedded]] in the plane, i.e., it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that its edges intersect only at their endpoints.  In other words, it can be drawn in such a way that no edges cross each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trudeau|first=Richard J.|title=Introduction to Graph Theory|year=1993|publisher=Dover Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-67870-2|pages=64|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486678709.html|edition=Corrected, enlarged republication.|accessdate=8 August 2012|quote=Thus a planar graph, when drawn on a flat surface, either has no edge-crossings or can be redrawn without them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a drawing is called a ''plane graph'' or ''planar embedding of the graph''. A plane graph can be defined as a planar graph with a mapping from every node to a point on a plane, and from every edge to a [[plane curve]] on that plane, such that the extreme points of each curve are the points mapped from its end nodes, and all curves are disjoint except on their extreme points.

== Concept ==
The primary mode of operation is the definition of a model consisting of compartments, species and chemical reactions, and reaction rates that are functions of concentrations. Given initial concentrations of species, the VCell can calculate how these concentrations change over time. 

Models can range from the simple to the highly complex, and can represent a mixture of experimental data and purely theoretical assumptions.

Users access Virtual Cell as a [[distributed application]] over the Internet. The web-based [[Java (programming language)|Java]] interface allows users to build complex models in biologically relevant terms: compartment dimensions and shape, molecular characteristics, and interaction parameters. VCell converts the biological description into an equivalent mathematical system of differential equations. Users can switch back-and-forth between the schematic biological view and the mathematical view in the common graphical interface. Indeed, if users desire, they can manipulate the mathematical description directly, bypassing the schematic view. VCell allows users a choice of numerical solvers to translate the mathematical description into software code which is executed to perform the simulations. The results can be displayed on-line, or they can be downloaded to the user's computer in a wide variety of export formats. The Virtual Cell license allows free access to all members of the scientific community.&lt;ref name=VCellHome&gt;{{cite web|title=VCell - The Virtual Cell|url=http://vcell.org/|publisher=UConn Health Center|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
VCell supports the following features:

* Simulations can be chosen to either resolve variations of concentrations over space ('''spatial simulations''') or assume concentrations constant across compartments ('''compartmental simulations''').
* For spatial simulations, geometries can be specified by [[analytic geometry]] equations, [[Constructive Solid Geometry|derived from combination of simple shapes]] or derived from imported images, such as 3D confocal microscope stacks. Utilities for segmenting image data into regions such as nucleus, cytosol and extracellular are provided.
* Simulations can be based on either integration of differential equations without use of random numbers ('''deterministic simulations''') or be based on random events ('''stochastic simulations''').
* Simulations can be run using a variety of solvers including: 6 [[ordinary differential equation]] (ODE) solvers, 2 [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) solvers, 4 non-spatial [[stochastic]] solvers and [[Smoldyn]]&lt;ref name=Smoldyn&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoldyn: a spatial stochastic simulator for chemical reaction networks|url=http://www.smoldyn.org/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for stochastic spatial simulations. Choices between fixed and variable time steps exist. Some solvers can be run locally, all solvers can be run remotely on VCell servers.
* For compartmental determinsitc models, the best parameter values to fit experimental data can be estimated using algorithms developed by the [[COPASI]] software system. These tools are available in VCell.
* Models and simulation setups (so-called '''Applications''') can be stored in local files as Virtual Cell Markup Language (VCML)&lt;ref name=VCMLSpec&gt;{{cite web|title=VCell Software Architecture - VCML Specification |url=http://www.nrcam.uchc.edu/technology/VcmlSpec.html |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or stored remotely in the [http://query1.cam.uchc.edu/WebQuery/ VCell database].
* Models can be imported and exported as [[SBML|Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)]]&lt;ref name=SBML&gt;{{cite web|title=Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)|url=http://sbml.org/Main_Page |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biological pathway]]s can be imported as [[BioPAX|Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX)]]&lt;ref name=BioPAX&gt;{{cite web|title=BioPAX - Biological Pathway Exchange |url=http://www.biopax.org/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build and annotate models. A VCell prototype (to be released as Beta in April 2012) also can import quantitative data as [[SBPAX|Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX)]].&lt;ref name=SBPAX&gt;{{cite web|title=Systems Biology Pathway Exchange|url=http://www.sbpax.org/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VCell allows users integrated access to a variety of sources to help build and annotate models: 

* Models stored in the VCell database can be made accessible by their authors to some users ('''shared''') or all users ('''public''').
* VCell can import models from the [[BioModels Database]].&lt;ref name=BioModels&gt;{{cite web |title=BioModels Database - A Database of Annotated Published Models|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/ |accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
