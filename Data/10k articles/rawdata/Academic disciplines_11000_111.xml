===Uptime Institute history===
Founded in 1987 by Kenneth G. Brill, the Uptime Institute was founded as an industry proponent to help owners and operators quantify and qualify their ability to provide a predictable level of performance from data centers, regardless of the status of external factors, such as power utilities. In 2009, the Uptime Institute was acquired by ''The 451 Group'' .&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22408554 Company Overview of The 451 Group LLC] at ''investing.businessweek.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the Seattle-based Uptime Institute has been an independent division of ''The 451 Group''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.451research.com/our-company The 451 Group - Our Company] at 451research.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uptime Institute tier certifications===
The Uptime Institute's [[Data center#Data center tiers|data center tier concepts]] have grown from a simple publication in the late 1990s of the ''Tier Classifications Define Site Infrastructure Performance'' white paper &lt;ref&gt;[https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/asset/tier-standard-topology/ Tier Classifications Define Site Infrastructure Performance]&lt;/ref&gt; to a globally recognized standard guiding design and investment for data centers globally. The data center Tier standards are a standardized methodology used to determine availability in a facility. It offers companies a way to measure [[return on investment]] (ROI) and define desired levels of delivered performance. As of 2017, more than 1000 data centers worldwide have formally certified their data centers using the Tier standard.

There are two parts of the Tier certification process:
*Tier Certification of Design Documents - typically the first step in the Tier process and used to align the design and construction of a new facility with an organization's business needs.
*Tier Certification of Constructed Facility - the final part of the process which assures that the actual constructed data centers delivers the results specified in the Tier Standard: Topology specification.

The Tier certifications are awarded in four levels:
*Tier IV - Fault tolerant site infrastructure
*Tier III - Concurrently maintainable site infrastructure
*Tier II - Redundant capacity components site infrastructure (redundant)
*Tier I - Basic site infrastructure (non-redundant)
The full Tier Standard:Topology is available on the Uptime Institute website&lt;ref&gt;https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/asset/tier-standard-topology&lt;/ref&gt;

Other design standards have been created by various industry groups over the years. All of these other specifications share the common trait that they are self-certified and the author of the specification does not get involved with the certification/assurance of standard compliance.  One such standard is [[Telecommunications Industry Association|Telecommunications Industry Association's]] standard, [[TIA-942]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?currency_code=USD&amp;customer_id=2125442B2B0A&amp;oshid=2125442B2C0A&amp;shopping_cart_id=292558332D4B50304F5A3D3F2C0A&amp;country_code=US&amp;lang_code=ENGL&amp;item_s_key=00414811&amp;item_key_date=940819&amp;input_doc_number=TIA-942&amp;input_doc_title= TIA-942 TIA-942 Telecommunications Infrastructure Standard for Data Centers] at ''ihs.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Uptime Institute and TIA agree on clear separation between their respective bench-marking systems to avoid industry confusion and drive accountability.&lt;ref&gt;http://uptimeinstitute.com/component/content/article/8-certifications/203-tiersvstia2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mace of nutmeg - ml-Jathi.jpg|thumb|right|An aril that surrounds the [[nutmeg seed]] is used as a [[spice]] called [[mace (spice)|mace]].]]
[[File:ARS Litchi chinensis.jpg|thumb|right|The edible white aril of ''[[Litchi chinensis]]'' is sometimes called an arillode or false aril. It grows partly from the [[funiculus (biology)|funiculus]] and partly from the [[integument]] of the seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Banerji, I. |author2=Chaudhuri, K.L. |year=1944 |title=A contribution to the life history of ''Litchi chinensis'' Sonn. |journal=Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Section B |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=19–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An '''aril''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|r|ɪ|l}}), also called an '''arillus''', is a specialized outgrowth from a seed that partly or completely covers the seed. An '''arillode''' or '''false aril''' is sometimes distinguished: whereas an aril grows from the attachment point of the seed to the [[ovary]] (from the [[Ovule|funiculus]] or ''[[Hilum (biology)|hilum]]''), an arillode forms from a different point on the seed coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Beentje, H. |author2=Williamson, J. |year=2010  |title=The Kew Plant Glossary: an Illustrated Dictionary of Plant Terms |publisher=Kew Publishing |location=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "aril" is sometimes applied to any fleshy appendage of the seed in [[flowering plants]], such as the [[mace (spice)|mace]] of the nutmeg seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Endress, P.K. |year=1973 |title=Arils And Aril-Like Structures In Woody Ranales |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=1159–1171 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1973.tb02092.x |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1973.tb02092.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arils and arillodes are often edible enticements that encourage animals to transport the seed, thereby assisting in seed dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvEOb0HKyoAC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=aril+edible+dispersal+seed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xnJzYdJhVT&amp;sig=r28-mZ3Cq5LivKdI1LJMQyEreLo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=11uZTvWVL87E8QOw-821BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aril%20&amp;f=false|title=Fruit and Seed Production|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Pseudarils''' are aril-like structures commonly found on the [[Pyrena|pyrenes]] of [[Burseraceae]] species that develop from the [[mesocarp]] of the ovary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/aobpla/pls027| pmid = 23115709| title = The fruit of Bursera: Structure, maturation and parthenocarpy| journal = [[AoB Plants]]| volume = 2012| pages = pls027| year = 2012| last1 = Ramos-Ordonez | first1 = M.

The aril may create a [[fruit]]-like structure, called (among other names) a ''[[accessory fruit|false fruit]]''. False fruit are found in numerous [[Angiosperm]] taxa. The edible false of the [[longan]], [[lychee]] and [[ackee]] fruits are highly developed arils surrounding the seed rather than a [[pericarp]] layer.  Such arils are also found in a few species of [[gymnosperm]]s, notably the [[Taxus|yews]] and related [[Pinophyta|conifers]] such as the [[Prumnopitys andina|lleuque]] and the [[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides|kahikatea]]. Instead of the [[wood]]y [[Conifer cone|cone]] typical of most gymnosperms, the reproductive structure of the yew consists of a single seed that becomes surrounded by a fleshy, cup-like covering. This covering is derived from a highly modified cone scale.

==Development in ''Taxus''==
In European yew plants (''[[Taxus baccata]]''), the aril starts out as a small, green band at the base of the seed, then turns brown to red as it enlarges and surrounds the seed, eventually becoming fleshy and scarlet in color at maturity. The aril is attractive to fruit-eating [[bird]]s and is non-toxic (all other parts of the yew are toxic, including the seed housed inside the aril. If the seed is crushed or breaks/splits in the stomach of a bird, animal or human it will result in poisoning), This serves to promote dispersal of the yew seed by birds, which digest the fleshy aril as a food source, and pass the seed out in their droppings.

[[File:Taxus baccata MHNT.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The fleshy aril that surrounds each seed in the [[Taxus baccata|yew]] is a highly modified seed cone scale.]]

==In ''Dacrycarpus dacrydioides''==

The kahikatea tree, ''[[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides]]'', is native to [[New Zealand]]. In pre-European times the aril of the kahikatea was a food source for [[Māori people|Māori]]. The washed arils were called ''koroi'' and were eaten raw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.conifers.org/po/Dacrycarpus_dacrydioides.php |title=Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (kahikatea) description |work=conifers.org |year=2011 |quote='The small fruit (koroi) are superabundant and highly nutritious.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5640">The '''Art Elective Program (AEP)''' is offered by schools in [[Singapore]] that have obtained permission from the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]]. This programme is also known as Higher Art and can also be offered as a [[Singapore]]-[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] [[General Certificate of Education]] [[GCE Ordinary Level|Ordinary Level]] (O-level) subject.

Lessons for the AEP are usually conducted in a separate classroom, sometimes after regular classes. Schools that offer AEP as a subject normally have an art room, a media lab and facilities to store and use art materials. In AEP, students learn how to design or work with digital art programs such as [[Adobe Illustrator]]. Techniques with basic media such as pencil, pen, and paint are taught.

The lessons also include Study Of the Visual Arts (SOVA), in which the students are taught to analyze works by renowned artists. 

==History==
AEP was announced in 1983 by the Ministry of Education. It was conceived as an enrichment programme for students with an artistic flair. It was started in January 1984 by the Chinese High School and the Nanyang Girls' High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19830825-1.2.61.aspx|title=Two schools to start flair for art programme|date=25 August 1983|newspaper=The Straits Times|page=14|access-date=10 April 2016|via=NewspaperSG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEP is designed to enable students with artistic abilities to undertake an enriched art programme. The AEP curriculum aims to develop students’ conceptual and analytical thinking and creativity. Samples of the AEP curriculum and students’ creative processes and artworks can be found in the catalogue published for the AEP exhibition.

==Projects==
Every year, students create at least two projects within the spectrum of art and design, such as photography or designing a logo. Projects are weighted heavily in the overall grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seab.gov.sg/pages/nationalExaminations/GOL/School_Candidates/2016_GCE_O.asp|title=SEAB list of O'level subject syllabus|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.seab.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examinations==
Throughout the year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/education-system/ |title= SEAB Education System Website|publisher=www.moe.gov.sg|date= |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;the students prepare SOVA and Drawing and Painting papers. The four exams are Continual Assessments 1 and 2, Semester Assessments 1 and 2. Drawing and Painting examinations vary in duration and students are allowed to create an art piece over around 2–3 hours. Two weeks before the Drawing and Painting exams, students are given several themes to choose from. They then have two weeks to complete their assigned task. The exam is marked according to five components: Investigation and Interpretation of Theme, Exploration and Development of Theme, Aesthetic Qualities, Control of Materials and Technical Processes and Personal Response. For the SOVA examination, students are tested on several artists whom they have studied. They examine selected artworks by these artists and interpret their styles and the methods applied to produce the artwork. This paper is considered a "theory" examination.

The '''Arts and Humanities Research Council''' ('''AHRC''') was established in April 2005 as successor to the Arts and Humanities Research Board and is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]]; [[non-departmental public body]] that provides approximately £102 million from the [[UK government|government]]  to support [[research]] and postgraduate study in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]], from languages and law, archaeology and English literature to design and creative and performing arts. In any one year, the AHRC makes approximately 700 research awards and around 1,350 postgraduate awards. Awards are made after a rigorous peer review process, to ensure that only applications of the highest quality are funded.

==Recently funded research==

===Stonehenge Riverside Project===

The [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]] is a major five year AHRC-funded archaeological research study interested in the development of the [[Stonehenge]] landscape in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain. In particular, the project is interested in the relationship between the stones and surrounding monuments and features including; The River Avon, Durrington Walls, the Cursus, the Avenue, Woodhenge, burial mounds, and nearby standing stones. In August 2009 the project discovered a new stone circle, which was named [[Bluestonehenge]] by the research team, about one mile away from [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]], England. The project is run by a consortium of university teams.  It is directed by Prof. Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University, with co-directors Dr Josh Pollard (University of Southampton), Prof. Julian Thomas (Manchester University), Dr Kate Welham (Bournemouth University) and Dr Colin Richards (Manchester University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shef.ac.uk/mediacentre/2009/1363.html |title=News releases 2009 |work=shef.ac.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Soldier Database===

Researchers at the University of Reading and University of Southampton analysed historic sources such as muster rolls records in the National Archives at Kew and the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris (for records of English garrisons in France). The resulting Medieval Soldier online database enables people to search for soldiers by surname, rank or year of service.  The online database contains 250,000 service records of soldiers who saw active duty in the latter phases of the Hundred Years' War (1369–1453).

===Old Bailey Proceedings Archive===

An AHRC research grant enabled academics from the [[University of Hertfordshire]], [[University of Sheffield]] and the [[Open University]] to double in size the [[Old Bailey]] trial proceedings available to view on the Old Bailey Proceedings Online website and provide access to the largest single source of searchable information about ordinary British lives and behaviour ever published.

The Old Bailey Proceedings Online makes available a fully searchable, digitised collection of all surviving editions of the Old Bailey Proceedings from 1674 to 1913, and of the [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]] of [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]]'s Accounts, 1679 to 1772. It allows access to over 197,000 trials and biographical details of approximately 2,500 men and women executed at [[Tyburn]].

==History==

In 2005 the AHRC replaced the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB), founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Creating the AHRC: An Arts and Humanities Research Council for the United Kingdom in the Twenty-first Century (Oxford UP, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The AHRC publish reviews and reports on arts and humanities subjects, as well as corporate publications. Research news and findings are communicated in website features, press releases, and multimedia content such as podcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/Publications/Pages/Publications.aspx |title=Publications - Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council |publisher=Ahrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2010, the AHRC published a magazine called ''Podium'' twice a year, which contained news and case studies based on research that they have funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/Publications/Publications-archive/Pages/Publications-archive.aspx/ |title=Publications archive - Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council |publisher=Ahrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The AHRC is one of seven [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] in the UK.

Professor Andrew S Thompson is serving as Interim Chief Executive of the AHRC, from December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/appointment-of-interim-chief-executive-for-the-arts-and-humanities-research-council&lt;/ref&gt; The previous CE of the AHRC was Professor Rick Rylance who took up the post on 1 September 2009, and was re-appointed in September 2013 to serve until August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/News/Pages/Reappointment-of-Chief-Executive-for-the-AHRC.aspx |title=Reappointment of Chief Executive for the AHRC - Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council |publisher=Ahrc.ac.uk |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Council Chair is Sir Drummond Bone. Sir [[Alan Wilson (academic)|Alan Wilson]] stepped down in December 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8424">In [[botanical nomenclature]], '''autonyms''' are automatically created names, as regulated by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' that are created for certain subdivisions of [[genus|genera]] and [[species]], those that include the [[type (biology)|type]] of the genus or species.&lt;ref name=Turland&gt;{{cite book|author=Turland, N.|year=2013|volume=Regnum Vegetabile Volume 155|title=The Code Decoded: A user's guide to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books|isbn=978-3-87429-433-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autonym might not be mentioned in the publication that creates it as a side-effect.&lt;ref name=Turland/&gt; Autonyms "repeat unaltered" the genus name or species epithet of the taxon being subdivided, and no other name for that same subdivision is [[valid name (botany)|validly published]] (article 22.2). For example, ''[[Rubus]]'' subgenus ''Eubatus'' is not validly published, and the subgenus is known as ''Rubus'' subgen. ''Rubus''.

Autonyms are cited without an author. The publication date of the autonym is taken to be the same as that of the subdivision(s) that automatically established the autonym, with some special provisions (the autonym is considered to have priority over the other names of the same rank established at the same time (article 11.6)).

Articles 6.8, 22.1-3 and 26.1-3 relate to establishing autonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG|isbn=978-3-87429-425-6|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonyms are not created if the name of the genus or species being subdivided is [[Nomen illegitimum|illegitimate]].&lt;ref name=Turland/&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of an autonym is in Art. 6.8 of the ICN:
:"''6.8.'' Autonyms are such names as can be established automatically under Art. 22.3  and 26.3, whether or not they appear in print in the publication in which they are created"

:"''22.3.'' The first instance of valid publication of a name of a [[genus|subdivision of a genus]] under a legitimate generic name automatically establishes the corresponding autonym (see also  Art. 11.6 and 32.8)." The form of this autonym is described in the earlier Art. 22.1: "The name of any subdivision of a genus that includes the [[botanical type|type]] of the [...] name of the genus to which it is assigned is to repeat the generic name unaltered as its epithet, not followed by an author citation [...] Such names are termed autonyms".

:"''26.3.'' The first instance of valid publication of a name of an infraspecific taxon under a legitimate species name automatically establishes the corresponding autonym (see also  Art. 32.8 and 11.6)." And as above, but now for infraspecific taxa, Art. 26.1 says: "The name of any infraspecific taxon that includes the type of the [...] name of the species to which it is assigned is to repeat the specific epithet unaltered as its final epithet, not followed by an author citation [...] Such names are termed autonyms".

==Interpretation==
The application of names of taxonomic groups is determined by means of nomenclatural types (Principle II of the ICN). For all taxa, nomenclatural types are preserved specimens or illustrations.

In the case of an infraspecific taxon, if a botanist described a new taxon and publishes a new name at infraspecific level, all elements that previously belonged to the species (and are not included in the newly described taxon) now become a new infraspecific taxon. But as neither the type nor the final epithet has changed, there is no need for a change in author citation.

The same goes for a subdivision of a genus. If a botanist creates a new subdivision of a genus, for example by dividing a large genus into two or more subgenera, sections, or series, then a new subdivision of the genus at each of the new ranks will share the type of the genus and have as its epithet the name of the genus.

As will be clear from the definition, an autonym can be one of two kinds:
* for a taxon at a rank below that of genus and above that of species (technically a "subdivision of genus", but loosely speaking an "infrageneric taxon"), in which case its epithet repeats the generic name (Art. 22), for example
:: [[Magnolia|''Magnolia'' L. sect. ''Magnolia'']], automatically established when [[Candolle|A.P. de Candolle]] published sect. ''Gwillimia'' DC., in: Syst. Nat. 1 (1817): 455.
* for a taxon at a rank below that of species (an infraspecific taxon), in which case the infraspecific epithet repeats the specific epithet (Art. 26), for example
:: [[Elmerrillia|''Elmerrillia papuana'' (Schltr.) Dandy var. ''papuana'']], automatically established when var. ''glaberrima'' Dandy, and var. ''adpressa'' Dandy were published.

==Other provisions concerning autonyms==
The name of a subdivision of a genus that includes the type of the genus is not validly published if its epithet does not repeat the generic name unaltered,&lt;ref&gt;ICBN (Vienna Code) Art. 22.2. "A name of a subdivision of a genus that includes the type [...] of the [...] name of the genus is not validly published unless its epithet repeats the generic name unaltered. [...]"&lt;/ref&gt; in other words: it may not be anything other than an autonym, for example

::When Seringe published ''Magnolia'' L. subgen. ''Gwillimia'' Ser., in: Fl. Jard. 3 (1849): 222, the autonym ''Magnolia'' L. subgen. ''Magnolia'' was automatically established. When the latter was named ''Magnolia'' L. subgen. ''Eumagnolia'' by Seringe, same publication, p. 224, that name was not validly published as it included [[Magnolia virginiana|''Magnolia virginiana'' L.]], the type of the genus. The autonym however, was validly published, even though it did not appear in print.

The same goes, ''mutatis mutandis'', for infraspecific taxa.&lt;ref&gt;ICBN (Vienna Code) Art. 26.2. "A name of an infraspecific taxon that includes the type [...] of the [...] name of the species is not validly published unless its final epithet repeats the specific epithet unaltered. [...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

An autonym is considered to have been published at exactly the same time as the earliest name(s) in that particular rank under the genus or species.
::When [[Alfred Rehder|Rehder]] &amp; [[Ernest Henry Wilson|Wilson]] in [[Charles Sprague Sargent|C.S. Sargent]], Pl. Wilson. 1 (1913): 392, published ''Magnolia officinalis'' Rehder &amp; E.H. Wilson var. ''biloba'', they established at the same time ''Magnolia officinalis'' Rehder &amp; E.H. Wilson var. ''officinalis'', even though that name was nowhere mentioned in ''Plantae Wilsonianae''.

The autonym has nomenclatural [[Principle of Priority|priority]] over the name (or the names, as the case may be) that established it (Art. 11.6).
::When ''Heracleum sibiricum'' L., with subsp. ''lecokii'' (Godr. &amp; Gren.) Nyman and subsp. ''sibiricum'' (autonym), is placed under [[Common Hogweed|''Heracleum sphondylium'' L.]] as a subspecies, then the correct name of the subspecies is ''Heracleum sphondylium'' L. subsp. ''sibiricum'' (L.) Simonk.&lt;ref&gt;ICBN (Vienna Code) Art. 11 Ex. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be viewed as uniting the subspecies ''lecokii'' and the subspecies ''sibiricum'' into one subspecies, and as such a choice has to be made between the two subspecies names; the autonym ''sibiricum'' has priority.

The type of an autonym is the same as that for the corresponding genus or species (Art. 7.6): "The type of an autonym is the same as that of the name from which it is derived." As an autonym is automatically created (without an author being involved), no author citation follows the name.

'''Botany''', also called '''plant science'''('''s'''), '''plant biology''' or '''phytology''', is the [[science]] of [[plant]] life and a branch of [[biology]]. A '''botanist''', '''plant scientist''' or '''phytologist''' is a [[scientist]] who specialises in this field. The term "botany" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|βοτάνη}} (''botanē'') meaning "[[pasture]]", "[[Poaceae|grass]]", or "[[fodder]]"; {{lang|grc|βοτάνη}} is in turn derived from {{lang|grc|βόσκειν}} (''boskein''), "to feed" or "to [[Grazing|graze]]".{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1940}}{{sfn|Gordh|Headrick|2001|p = 134}}{{sfn|Online Etymology Dictionary|2012}}  Traditionally, botany has also included the study of [[fungus|fungi]] and [[algae]] by [[mycology|mycologists]] and [[phycology|phycologists]] respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the [[International Botanical Congress]]. Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 [[species]] of [[Embryophyte|land plants]] of which some 391,000 species are [[vascular plant]]s (including ca 369,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s),&lt;ref&gt;RBG Kew (2016). The State of the World’s Plants Report – 2016. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. https://stateoftheworldsplants.com/report/sotwp_2016.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928190506/https://stateoftheworldsplants.com/report/sotwp_2016.pdf |date=2016-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ca 20,000 are [[bryophyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/1.1/browse/B/|title=The Plant List - Bryophytes|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botany originated in prehistory as [[herbalism]] with the efforts of early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest branches of science. Medieval [[physic garden]]s, often attached to [[Monastery|monasteries]], contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first [[botanical garden]]s attached to [[University|universities]], founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]]. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of [[plant taxonomy]], and led in 1753 to the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system]] of [[Carl Linnaeus]] that remains in use to this day.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of plants, including methods of [[optical microscope|optical microscopy]] and [[live cell imaging]], [[electron microscopy]], analysis of [[ploidy|chromosome number]], [[phytochemistry|plant chemistry]] and the structure and function of [[enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of [[molecular biology|molecular genetic analysis]], including [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] and [[DNA sequences]] to classify plants more accurately.

Modern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with inputs from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant [[Plant morphology|structure]], [[cell growth|growth]] and differentiation, [[Plant reproduction|reproduction]], [[plant physiology#Biochemistry of plants|biochemistry]] and [[metabolism|primary metabolism]], [[phytochemistry|chemical products]], [[Plant morphology#Development|development]], [[plant pathology|diseases]], [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]], [[systematics]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|plant taxonomy]]. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are [[molecular genetics]] and [[epigenetics]], which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of [[plant cell]]s and [[Tissue (biology)#Plant tissues|tissues]]. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing [[staple foods]], materials such as [[Lumber|timber]], [[oil]], rubber, [[Fiber|fibre]] and drugs, in modern [[horticulture]], [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], [[plant propagation]], [[Plant breeding|breeding]] and [[genetic modification]], in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in [[environmental management]], and the maintenance of [[biodiversity]].

{{Main|History of botany}}

=== Early botany ===
[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|alt=engraving of cork cells from Hooke's Micrographia, 1665|An engraving of the cells of [[Cork oak|cork]], from [[Robert Hooke]]'s ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]

Botany originated as [[herbalism]], the study and use of plants for their medicinal properties.{{sfn|Sumner|2000|p = 16}} Many records of the [[Holocene]] period date early botanical knowledge as far back as 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delcourt|first=Paul A.|last2=Delcourt|first2=Hazel R.|last3=Cridlebaugh|first3=Patricia A.|last4=Chapman|first4=Jefferson|date=1986-05-01|title=Holocene ethnobotanical and paleoecological record of human impact on vegetation in the Little Tennessee River Valley, Tennessee|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0033589486900050|journal=Quaternary Research|volume=25|issue=3|pages=330–349|doi=10.1016/0033-5894(86)90005-0|bibcode=1986QuRes..25..330D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within [[Tennessee]], which make up much of the [[Cherokee]] land today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC,{{sfn|Reed|1942|pp = 7–29}}{{sfn|Oberlies|1998|p = 155}} in archaic [[Avestan language|Avestan]] writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.{{sfn|Reed|1942|pp = 7–29}}{{sfn|Needham|Lu|Huang|1986}}

Modern botany traces its roots back to [[Ancient Greece]] specifically to [[Theophrastus]] (c. 371–287 BC), a student of [[Aristotle]] who invented and described many of its principles and is widely regarded in the [[scientific community]] as the "Father of Botany".{{sfn|Greene|1909|pp = 140–142}} His major works, ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'' and ''On the Causes of Plants'', constitute the most important contributions to botanical science until the [[Middle Ages]], almost seventeen centuries later.{{sfn|Greene|1909|pp = 140–142}}{{sfn|Bennett|Hammond|1902|p = 30}}

Another work from Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is ''De Materia Medica'', a five-volume encyclopedia about [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] written in the middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]. ''De Materia Medica'' was widely read for more than 1,500 years.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|p = 532}} Important contributions from the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Muslim world]] include [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''Nabatean Agriculture'', [[Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī]]'s (828–896) the ''Book of Plants'', and [[Ibn Bassal]]'s ''The Classification of Soils''. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.{{sfn|Dallal|2010|p = 197}}{{sfn|Panaino|2002|p = 93}}{{sfn|Levey|1973|p = 116}}

In the mid-16th century, "[[botanical garden]]s" were founded in a number of Italian universities – the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]] in 1545 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location. These gardens continued the practical value of earlier "physic gardens", often associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for medical use. They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated. Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was the [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden]] in 1621. Throughout this period, botany remained firmly subordinate to medicine.{{sfn|Hill|1915}}

German physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501–1566) was one of "the three German fathers of botany", along with theologian [[Otto Brunfels]] (1489–1534) and physician [[Hieronymus Bock]] (1498–1554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus).{{sfn|National Museum of Wales|2007}}{{sfn|Yaniv|Bachrach|2005|p = 157}} Fuchs and Brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works to make original observations of their own. Bock created his own system of plant classification.

Physician [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515–1544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal ''Historia Plantarum'' in 1544 and a [[pharmacopoeia]] of lasting importance, the ''Dispensatorium'' in 1546.{{sfn|Sprague|1939}} Naturalist [[Conrad von Gesner]] (1516–1565) and herbalist [[John Gerard]] (1545–c. 1611) published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (1522–1605) was considered the ''father of natural history'', which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Polymath]] [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]], a term he coined, in [[cork (material)|cork]], and a short time later in living plant tissue.{{sfn|Waggoner|2001}}

{{Further|Taxonomy (biology)#History of taxonomy}}
[[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a garden|The [[Linnaean Garden]] of Linnaeus' residence in Uppsala, Sweden, was planted according to his ''Systema sexuale''.]]

During the 18th century, systems of [[plant identification]] were developed comparable to [[single access key|dichotomous keys]], where unidentified plants are placed into [[taxon]]omic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices between pairs of [[Character (biology)|characters]]. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification ([[single access key#Diagnostic ('artificial') versus synoptic ('natural') keys|diagnostic keys]]) or more closely related to the natural or [[taxonomic order|phyletic order]] of the [[taxon|taxa]] in synoptic keys.{{sfn|Scharf|2009|pp = 73–117}} By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753, [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linné]] (Carl Linnaeus) published his [[Species Plantarum]], a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|modern botanical nomenclature]]. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the [[genus]] and the second identified the [[species]] within the genus.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp = 220–223}} For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's ''Systema Sexuale'' [[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification for plants|classified]] plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, ''Cryptogamia'', included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.{{sfn|Hoek|Mann|Jahns|2005|p = 9}}

Increasing knowledge of [[plant anatomy]], [[plant morphology|morphology]] and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. [[Michel Adanson|Adanson]] (1763), [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Candolle]] (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The [[Candollean system]] reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the [[Bentham &amp; Hooker system|later classification]] by [[George Bentham|Bentham]] and [[J.D. Hooker|Hooker]], which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s publication of the ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.{{sfn|Starr|2009|p =299–}}

Botany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first "modern" textbook, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s ''{{lang|de|Grundzüge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik}}'', published in English in 1849 as ''Principles of Scientific Botany''.{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 377}}  Schleiden was a microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the [[cell theory]] with [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]] and was among the first to grasp the significance of the [[cell nucleus]] that had been described by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] in 1831.{{sfn|Harris|2000|pp = 76–81}}
In 1855, [[Adolf Fick]] formulated [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's laws]] that enabled the calculation of the rates of [[molecular diffusion]] in biological systems.{{sfn|Small|2012|p =118–}}

[[File:Echeveria glauca II.jpg|thumb|''Echeveria glauca'' in a Connecticut greenhouse. Botany uses Latin names for identification, here, the specific name ''glauca'' means blue.]]

=== Late modern botany ===
[[File:Apfe-auf-Naehrboden.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=Micropropagation of transgenic plants|Micropropagation of transgenic plants]]

Building upon the gene-chromosome theory of heredity that originated with [[Gregor Mendel]] (1822–1884), [[August Weismann]] (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through [[gamete]]s. No other cells can pass on inherited characters.{{sfn|Karp|2009|p = 382}} The work of [[Katherine Esau]] (1898–1997) on plant anatomy is still a major foundation of modern botany. Her books ''Plant Anatomy'' and ''Anatomy of Seed Plants'' have been key plant structural biology texts for more than half a century.{{sfn|National Science Foundation|1989}}{{sfn|Chaffey|2007|pp = 481–482}}

The discipline of [[plant ecology]] was pioneered in the late 19th century by botanists such as [[Eugenius Warming]], who produced the hypothesis that plants form [[plant community|communities]], and his mentor and successor [[Christen C. Raunkiær]] whose system for describing [[Raunkiær plant life-form|plant life forms]] is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forest]] changes by a process of [[ecological succession]] was developed by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]], [[Arthur Tansley]] and [[Frederic Clements]]. Clements is credited with the idea of [[climax vegetation]] as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of [[ecosystem]]s to biology.{{sfn|Tansley|1935|pp=299–302}}{{sfn|Willis|1997||pp=267–271}}{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 457}} Building on the extensive earlier work of [[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle|Alphonse de Candolle]], [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov|Nikolai Vavilov]] (1887–1943) produced accounts of the [[biogeography]], [[Center of origin|centres of origin]], and evolutionary history of economic plants.{{sfn|de Candolle|2006|pp = 9–25, 450–465}}

Particularly since the mid-1960s there have been advances in understanding of the physics of [[Plant physiology|plant physiological]] processes such as [[transpiration]] (the transport of water within plant tissues),  the temperature dependence of rates of water [[evaporation]] from the leaf surface and the [[molecular diffusion]] of water vapour and carbon dioxide through [[stomatal]] apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, and the rate of [[photosynthesis]] have enabled precise description of the rates of [[gas exchange]] between plants and the atmosphere.{{sfn|Jasechko|Sharp|Gibson|Birks|2013|pp = 347–350}}{{sfn|Nobel|1983|p = 608}} Innovations in [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] by [[Ronald Fisher]],{{sfn|Yates|Mather|1963|pp = 91–129}} [[Frank Yates]] and others at [[Rothamsted Research#Statistical science|Rothamsted Experimental Station]] facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research.{{sfn|Finney|1995|pp = 554–573}} The discovery and identification of the [[auxin]] [[Plant physiology#Plant hormones|plant hormones]] by [[Kenneth V. Thimann]] in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals. [[Frederick Campion Steward]] pioneered techniques of [[micropropagation]] and [[plant tissue culture]] controlled by plant hormones.{{sfn|Cocking|1993}} The synthetic auxin [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] or 2,4-D was one of the first commercial synthetic herbicides.{{sfn|Cousens|Mortimer|1995}}

20th century developments in plant biochemistry have been driven by modern techniques of [[organic chemistry|organic chemical analysis]], such as [[spectroscopy]], [[chromatography]] and [[electrophoresis]]. With the rise of the related molecular-scale biological approaches of [[molecular biology]], [[genomics]], [[proteomics]] and [[metabolomics]], the relationship between the plant [[genome]] and most aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed experimental analysis.{{sfn|Ehrhardt|Frommer|2012|pp = 1–21}} The concept originally stated by [[Gottlieb Haberlandt]] in 1902{{sfn|Haberlandt|1902|pages=69–92}} that all plant cells are [[Cell potency#Totipotency|totipotent]] and can be grown ''in vitro'' ultimately enabled the use of [[genetic engineering]] experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait, or to add genes such as [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] that [[reporter gene|report]] when a gene of interest is being expressed. These technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in [[bioreactors]] to synthesise [[Bt corn|pesticides]], [[Biopharmaceutics|antibiotics]] or other [[pharming (genetics)|pharmaceuticals]], as well as the practical application of [[genetically modified crops]] designed for traits such as improved yield.{{sfn|Leonelli|Charnley|Webb|Bastow|2012}}

Modern morphology recognises a continuum between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and [[trichome]].{{sfn|Sattler|Jeune|1992|pp = 249-262}} Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics.{{sfn|Sattler|1992|pp = 708-714}} Modern systematics aims to reflect and discover [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic relationships]] between plants.{{sfn|Ereshefsky|1997|pp = 493–519}}{{sfn|Gray|Sargent|1889|pp = 292–293}}{{sfn|Medbury|1993|pp = 14–16}}{{sfn|Judd|Campbell|Kellogg|Stevens|2002|pp = 347–350}} Modern [[Molecular phylogenetics]] largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of [[nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequences]] from most families of flowering plants enabled the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] to publish in 1998 a [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of flowering plants, answering many of the questions about relationships among [[angiosperm]] families and species.{{sfn|Burger|2013}} The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by [[DNA barcoding]] is the subject of active current research.{{sfn|Kress|Wurdack|Zimmer|Weigt|2005|pp = 8369–8374}}{{sfn|Janzen|Forrest|Spouge|Hajibabaei|2009|pp = 12794–12797}}

The study of plants is vital because they underpin almost all animal life on Earth by generating a large proportion of the [[oxygen]] and food that provide humans and other organisms with [[cellular respiration|aerobic respiration]] with the chemical energy they need to exist. Plants, [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] are the major groups of organisms that carry out [[photosynthesis]], a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and [[carbon dioxide]]{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 186–187}} into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|p = 1240}} As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release [[oxygen]] into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by [[anaerobic organism|nearly]] all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global [[carbon cycle|carbon]] and [[water cycle|water]] cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil [[erosion]].{{sfn|Gust|1996}} Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.{{sfn|Missouri Botanical Garden|2009}}

Historically, all living things were classified as either animals or plants{{sfn|Chapman et al.|2001|p = 56}} and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals.{{sfn|Braselton|2013}} Botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant [[organelle]]s, cells, tissues, whole plants, plant populations and plant communities. At each of these levels, a botanist may be concerned with the classification ([[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]), [[phylogeny]] and [[evolution]], structure ([[Plant anatomy|anatomy]] and [[Plant morphology|morphology]]), or function ([[Plant physiology|physiology]]) of plant life.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|p = 5368}}

The strictest definition of "plant" includes only the "land plants" or [[embryophytes]], which include [[seed plants]] (gymnosperms, including the [[Pinophyta|pines]], and [[flowering plant]]s) and the free-sporing [[cryptogams]] including [[fern]]s, [[Lycopodiopsida|clubmosses]], [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], [[hornwort]]s and [[moss]]es. Embryophytes are multicellular [[eukaryote]]s descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by [[photosynthesis]]. They have life cycles with [[alternation of generations|alternating]] [[haploid]] and [[diploid]] phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, known as the [[gametophyte]], nurtures the developing diploid embryo [[sporophyte]] within its tissues for at least part of its life,{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|p = 602}} even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 619–620}} Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in [[bacteriology]]), fungi ([[mycology]]) – including [[lichen]]-forming fungi ([[lichenology]]), non-[[Chlorophyta|chlorophyte]] [[algae]] ([[phycology]]), and viruses ([[virology]]). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic [[protist]]s are usually covered in introductory botany courses.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp = 10–11}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 1–3}}

[[Paleobotany|Palaeobotanists]] study ancient plants in the fossil record to provide information about the [[evolutionary history of plants]]. [[Cyanobacteria]], the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an [[endosymbiotic]] relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the [[chloroplast]]s in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric [[oxygen]] started by the [[cyanobacteria]], [[great oxygenation event|changing]] the ancient oxygen-free, [[Redox|reducing]], atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.{{sfn|Cleveland Museum of Natural History|2012}}{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 516–517}}

Among the important botanical questions of the 21st century are the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and water, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of [[resource management]], [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], [[food security|human food security]], [[introduced species|biologically invasive organisms]], [[carbon sequestration]], [[climate change]], and [[sustainability]].{{sfn|Botanical Society of America|2013}}

=== Human nutrition ===
{{Further|Human nutrition}}
[[File:Brown rice.jpg|right|thumb|alt=grains of brown rice, a staple food|The food we eat comes directly or indirectly from plants such as rice.]]
Virtually all staple foods come either directly from [[primary production]] by plants, or indirectly from animals that eat them.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|pp = 5367–5368}}  Plants and other photosynthetic organisms are at the base of most [[food chain]]s because they use the energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil and atmosphere, converting them into a form that can be used by animals. This is what ecologists call the first [[trophic level]].{{sfn|Butz|2007|pp = 534–553}}  The modern forms of the major [[staple food]]s, such as [[hemp]], [[teff]], maize, rice, wheat and other cereal grasses, [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]], bananas and plantains,{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp = 106–126}} as well as [[hemp]], [[flax]] and [[cotton]] grown for their fibres, are the outcome of prehistoric selection over thousands of years from among [[Neolithic founder crops|wild ancestral plants]] with the most desirable characteristics.{{sfn|Zohary|Hopf|2000|pp = 20–22}}

Botanists study how plants produce food and how to increase yields, for example through [[plant breeding]], making their work important to humanity's ability to feed the world and provide [[food security]] for future generations.{{sfn|Floros|Newsome|Fisher|2010}} Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of [[Plant pathology|plant pathogens]] in agriculture and natural [[ecosystems]].{{sfn|Schoening|2005}} [[Ethnobotany]] is the study of the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or [[paleoethnobotany|palaeoethnobotany]].{{sfn|Acharya|Anshu|2008|p = 440}} Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPDErXqH8YYC|title=Traditional Plant Foods of Canadian Indigenous Peoples: Nutrition, Botany, and Use|last=Kuhnlein|first=Harriet V.|last2=Turner|first2=Nancy J.|date=1991-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9782881244650|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Plant biochemistry ==

Plant biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes used by plants. Some of these processes are used in their [[primary metabolism]] like the photosynthetic [[Calvin cycle]] and [[crassulacean acid metabolism]].{{sfn|Lüttge|2006|pp = 7–25}} Others make specialised materials like the [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]] used to build their bodies, and [[Secondary metabolism|secondary products]] like [[resin]]s and [[aroma compounds]].

&lt;/div&gt;

Plants and various other groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes collectively known as "[[algae]]" have unique organelles known as [[chloroplast]]s. Chloroplasts are thought to be descended from [[cyanobacteria]] that formed [[endosymbiotic]] relationships with ancient plant and algal ancestors. Chloroplasts and cyanobacteria contain the blue-green pigment [[chlorophyll a|chlorophyll ''a'']].{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp=190–193}} Chlorophyll ''a'' (as well as its plant and green algal-specific cousin [[chlorophyll b|chlorophyll ''b'']]){{efn|Chlorophyll ''b'' is also found in some cyanobacteria. A bunch of other chlorophylls exist in [[cyanobacteria]] and certain algal groups, but none of them are found in land plants.{{sfn|Kim|Archibald|2009|pp=1–39}}{{sfn|Howe|Barbrook|Nisbet|Lockhart|2008|pp=2675–2685}}{{sfn|Takaichi|2011|pp=1101–1118}}}} absorbs light in the blue-violet and orange/red parts of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]] while reflecting and transmitting the green light that we see as the characteristic colour of these organisms. The energy in the red and blue light that these pigments absorb is used by chloroplasts to make energy-rich carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by [[Carbon fixation#Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]], a process that generates [[molecular oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a by-product.

{{Plain image|File:Calvin-cycle4.svg|'''The Calvin cycle''' ''(Interactive diagram)'' The [[Calvin cycle]] incorporates carbon dioxide into sugar molecules.|435px|right|top|triangle|#ccc|image override=}}
{{Calvin cycle|Alt=An interactive diagram of the Calvin cycle|caption='''Calvin cycle''' ''(Interactive diagram)''}}

The light energy captured by [[chlorophyll a|chlorophyll ''a'']] is initially in the form of electrons (and later a [[proton gradient]]) that's used to make molecules of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the [[light-independent reactions]] of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme [[rubisco]] to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which [[glucose]] and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose is converted to starch which is stored in the chloroplast.{{sfn|Lewis|McCourt|2004|pp=1535–1556}} Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while [[inulin]], a polymer of [[fructose]] is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family [[Asteraceae]]. Some of the glucose is converted to [[sucrose]] (common table sugar) for export to the rest of the plant.

Unlike in animals (which lack chloroplasts), plants and their eukaryote relatives have delegated many biochemical roles to their [[chloroplast]]s, including synthesising all their [[fatty acids]],{{sfn|Padmanabhan|Dinesh-Kumar|2010|pp=1368–1380}}{{sfn|Schnurr|Shockey|De Boer|Browse|2002|pp=1700–1709}} and most [[amino acids]].{{sfn|Ferro|Salvi|Rivière-Rolland|Vermat|2002|pp=11487–11492}} The fatty acids that chloroplasts make are used for many things, such as providing material to build [[cell membrane]]s out of and making the polymer [[cutin]] which is found in the [[plant cuticle]] that protects land plants from drying out. {{sfn|Kolattukudy|1996|pp=83–108}}

Plants synthesise a number of unique [[polymer]]s like the [[polysaccharide]] molecules [[cellulose]], [[pectin]] and [[xyloglucan]]{{sfn|Fry|1989|pp=1–11}} from which the land plant cell wall is constructed.{{sfn|Thompson|Fry|2001|pp=23–34}}
Vascular land plants make [[lignin]], a polymer used to strengthen the [[secondary cell walls]] of xylem [[tracheid]]s and [[Xylem vessel element|vessels]] to keep them from collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like [[Ground tissue#Sclerenchyma|sclerenchyma fibres]] that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. [[Sporopollenin]] is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the [[Ordovician]] period.{{sfn|Kenrick|Crane|1997|pp=33–39}}
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during the [[Ordovician]] and [[Silurian]] periods. Many [[monocots]] like [[maize]] and the [[pineapple]] and some [[dicots]] like the [[Asteraceae]] have since independently evolved{{sfn|Gowik|Westhoff|2010|pp=56–63}} pathways like [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] and the [[C4 carbon fixation|{{C4}} carbon fixation]] pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from [[photorespiration]] in the more common [[C3 carbon fixation|{{C3}} carbon fixation]] pathway. These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants.

=== Medicine and materials ===
[[File:Tapping a rubber tree in Thailand.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Plantation worker tapping a rubber tree|Tapping a rubber tree in Thailand]]
[[Phytochemistry]] is a branch of plant biochemistry primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during [[secondary metabolism]].{{sfn|Benderoth|Textor|Windsor|Mitchell-Olds|2006|pp = 9118–9123}} Some of these compounds are toxins such as the [[alkaloid]] [[coniine]] from [[conium|hemlock]]. Others, such as the [[essential oil]]s [[Peppermint#Peppermint oil|peppermint oil]] and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., [[capsaicin]]), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in [[opium]] from [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppies]]. Many [[medication|medicinal]] and [[recreational drugs]], such as [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (active ingredient in [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]), [[caffeine]], [[morphine]] and [[nicotine]] come directly from plants. Others are simple [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer [[aspirin]] is the acetyl [[ester]] of [[salicylic acid]], originally isolated from the [[bark (biology)|bark]] of [[willow]] trees,{{sfn|Jeffreys|2005|pp = 38–40}} and a wide range of [[opiate]] [[analgesics|painkillers]] like [[diamorphine|heroin]] are obtained by chemical modification of [[morphine]] obtained from the [[opium poppy]].{{sfn|Mann|1987|pp = 186–187}} Popular [[stimulant]]s come from plants, such as [[caffeine]] from coffee, tea and chocolate, and [[nicotine]] from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of [[carbohydrate]]-rich plant products such as [[barley]] (beer), rice ([[sake]]) and grapes (wine).{{sfn|University of Maryland Medical Center|2011}} [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Indians Use Wild Plants for Food, Medicine, and Crafts|last=Frances|first=Densmore|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1974|isbn=9780486131108|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by [[Ethnobotany|enthnobotanists]] and then in turn has been used by [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] as a way of [[drug discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCutcheon|first=A.

Plants can synthesise useful coloured dyes and pigments such as the [[anthocyanin]]s responsible for the red colour of [[red wine]], yellow [[Reseda luteola|weld]] and blue [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]] used together to produce [[Lincoln green]], [[indoxyl]], source of the blue dye [[indigo]] traditionally used to dye denim and the artist's pigments [[gamboge]] and [[rose madder]].
Sugar, [[starch]], cotton, [[linen]], [[hemp]], some types of [[rope]], wood and [[particle board]]s, [[papyrus]] and paper, [[vegetable oil]]s, [[epicuticular wax|wax]], and [[natural rubber]] are examples of commercially important materials made from plant tissues or their secondary products.

Plant ecology is the science of the functional relationships between plants and their [[habitat]]s—the environments where they complete their [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]]. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional [[flora]]s, their [[biodiversity]], genetic diversity and [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]], the [[adaptation]] of plants to their environment, and their competitive or [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] interactions with other species.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 786–818}} Some ecologists even rely on [[Empirical evidence|empirical data]] from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists.&lt;ref name="TeachEthnobotany"&gt;{{Citation|last=TeachEthnobotany|title=Cultivation of peyote by Native Americans: Past, present and future|date=2012-06-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK5ZjSiIEGE|accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information can relay a great deal of information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it has changed over that time.&lt;ref name="TeachEthnobotany"/&gt; The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp = 1–73}}

Plants depend on certain [[edaphic]] (soil) and climatic factors in their environment but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change their environment's [[albedo]], increase [[Surface runoff|runoff]] interception, stabilise mineral soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms in their [[ecosystem]] for resources.{{sfn|Addelson|2003}}{{sfn|Grime|Hodgson|1987|pp = 283–295}} They interact with their neighbours at a variety of [[spatial scale]]s in groups, populations and [[Community (ecology)|communities]] that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions with characteristic [[Holdridge life zones|vegetation types]] and dominant plants as well as similar [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] and [[Biotic components|biotic]] factors, [[climate]], and [[geography]] make up [[biomes]] like [[tundra]] or [[tropical rainforest]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 819–848}}

[[Herbivore]]s eat plants, but plants can [[plant defence against herbivory|defend themselves]] and some species are [[parasitic plant|parasitic]] or even [[carnivorous plant|carnivorous]]. Other organisms form [[mutualism (biology)|mutually]] beneficial relationships with plants. For example, [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi and [[rhizobia]] provide plants with nutrients in exchange for food, [[ant]]s are recruited by [[myrmecophyte|ant plants]] to provide protection,{{sfn|Herrera|Pellmyr|2002|pp = 211–235}} [[honey bee]]s, [[bat]]s and other animals [[pollinate]] flowers{{sfn|Proctor|Yeo|1973|p = 479}}{{sfn|Herrera|Pellmyr|2002|pp = 157–185}} and [[seed dispersal#Dispersal by humans|humans]] and [[seed dispersal#Dispersal by animals|other animals]]{{sfn|Herrera|Pellmyr|2002|pp = 185–210}} act as [[dispersal vector]]s to spread [[spore]]s and [[seed]]s.

=== Plants, climate and environmental change ===
Plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can inform our understanding of how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity. For example, plant [[phenology]] can be a useful [[proxy (climate)|proxy]] for temperature in [[historical climatology]], and the biological impact of [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. [[Palynology]], the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from [[geologic timescale|thousands or millions of years ago]] allows the reconstruction of past climates.{{sfn|Bennett|Willis|2001|pp = 5–32}} Estimates of atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations since the [[Palaeozoic]] have been obtained from [[stomatal]] densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient [[land plants]].{{sfn|Beerling|Osborne|Chaloner|2001|pp = 287–394}} [[Ozone depletion]] can expose plants to higher levels of [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation-B]] (UV-B), resulting in lower growth rates.{{sfn|Björn|Callaghan|Gehrke|Johanson|1999|pp = 449–454}} Moreover, information from studies of [[community (ecology)|community ecology]], plant [[systematics]], and [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] is essential to understanding [[climate change#Vegetation|vegetation change]], [[habitat destruction]] and [[endangered species|species extinction]].{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|pp = 5369–5370}}

== Genetics ==
{{Main|Plant genetics}}
{{plain image|File:Punnett square mendel flowers.svg|A [[Punnett square]] depicting a cross between two pea plants [[heterozygous]] for purple (B) and white (b) blossoms|250px|left|bottom|triangle|#51e89e}}

Inheritance in plants follows the same fundamental principles of genetics as in other multicellular organisms. [[Gregor Mendel]] discovered the [[Mendelian inheritance|genetic laws of inheritance]] by studying inherited traits such as shape in ''Pisum sativum'' ([[peas]]). What Mendel learned from studying plants has had far reaching benefits outside of botany. Similarly, "[[transposon|jumping genes]]" were discovered by [[Barbara McClintock]] while she was studying maize.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|p = 5369}} Nevertheless, there are some distinctive genetic differences between plants and other organisms.

Species boundaries in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are often possible. A familiar example is [[peppermint]], ''Mentha'' × ''piperita'', a [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] hybrid between ''[[Mentha aquatica]]'' and spearmint, ''[[Mentha spicata]]''.{{sfn|Stace|2010b||pp = 629–633}} The many cultivated varieties of wheat are the result of multiple inter- and intra-[[species|specific]] crosses between wild species and their hybrids.{{sfn|Hancock|2004|pp = 190–196}} [[Angiosperms]] with [[monoecious]] flowers often have [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatibility mechanisms]] that operate between the [[pollen]] and [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to [[germinate]] and produce male [[gamete]]s.{{sfn|Sobotka|Sáková|Curn|2000|pp = 103–112}} This is one of several methods used by plants to promote [[plant reproductive morphology|outcrossing]].{{sfn|Renner|Ricklefs|1995|pp = 596–606}} In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be [[Plant reproductive morphology#Terminology|dioecious]] when referring to vascular plant [[sporophyte]]s and [[monoecious|dioicous]] when referring to [[bryophyte]] [[gametophyte]]s.{{sfn|Porley|Hodgetts|2005|pp = 2–3}}

Unlike in higher animals, where [[parthenogenesis]] is rare, [[asexual reproduction]] may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem [[tuber]]s in potato is one example. Particularly in [[arctic]] or [[alpine climate|alpine]] habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers [[zoophily|by animals]] are rare, plantlets or [[bulbs]], may develop instead of flowers, replacing [[sexual reproduction]] with [[asexual reproduction]] and giving rise to [[cloning|clonal populations]] genetically identical to the parent. This is one of several types of [[apomixis]] that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a [[seed]], producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.{{sfn|Savidan|2000|pp = 13–86}}

Most [[sexually reproducing]] organisms are diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their [[chromosome number]] may occur due to errors in [[cell division|cytokinesis]]. This can occur early in development to produce an [[autopolyploid]] or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid ([[endopolyploidy]]), or during [[gamete]] formation. An [[allopolyploid]] plant may result from a [[hybridization event|hybridisation event]] between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but may be unable to cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are [[reproductively isolated]] from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new [[sympatric speciation|species]].{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495–496}} Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce [[vegetative propagation|vegetatively]] or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 495–496}} [[Durum]] wheat is a fertile [[tetraploid]] allopolyploid, while [[common wheat|bread wheat]] is a fertile [[hexaploid]]. The commercial banana is an example of a sterile, seedless [[triploid]] hybrid. [[Taraxacum officinale|Common dandelion]] is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.

As in other eukaryotes, the inheritance of [[endosymbiotic]] organelles like [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s in plants is non-[[Mendelian]]. Chloroplasts are inherited through the male parent in gymnosperms but often through the female parent in flowering plants.{{sfn|Morgensen|1996|pp = 383–384}}

A considerable amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of [[model organism#Plants|model plants]] such as the Thale cress, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', a weedy species in the mustard family ([[Brassicaceae]]).{{sfn|Benderoth|Textor|Windsor|Mitchell-Olds|2006|pp = 9118–9123}} The [[genome]] or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million [[base pairs]] of DNA, forming one of the smallest genomes among [[flowering plants]]. ''Arabidopsis'' was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000.{{sfn|Arabidopsis Genome Initiative|2000|pp = 796–815}} The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (''[[Oryza sativa]]''){{sfn|Devos|Gale|2000}} and ''[[Brachypodium distachyon]]'',{{sfn|University of California-Davis|2012}} has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of [[cereals]], [[grasses]] and [[monocots]] generally.

[[Model organism#Plants|Model plants]] such as ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' are used for studying the molecular biology of [[plant cell]]s and the [[chloroplast]]. Ideally, these organisms have small genomes that are well known or completely sequenced, small stature and short generation times. Corn has been used to study mechanisms of [[photosynthesis]] and [[phloem]] loading of sugar in [[C4 plants|{{C4}} plants]].{{sfn|Russin|Evert|Vanderveer|Sharkey|1996|pp = 645–658}} The [[single celled]] [[green alga]] ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'', while not an [[embryophyte]] itself, contains a [[chlorophyll b|green-pigmented]] [[Chloroplast#Chloroplastida (green algae and plants)|chloroplast]] related to that of land plants, making it useful for study.{{sfn|Rochaix|Goldschmidt-Clermont|Merchant|1998|p = 550}} A [[red alga]] ''[[Cyanidioschyzon merolae]]'' has also been used to study some basic chloroplast functions.{{sfn|Glynn|Miyagishima|Yoder|Osteryoung|2007|pages = 451–461}} [[Spinach]],{{sfn|Possingham|Rose|1976|pp = 295–305}} [[peas]],{{sfn|Sun|Forouhar|Li|Tu|2002|pp = 95–100}} [[soybeans]] and a moss ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' are commonly used to study plant cell biology.{{sfn|Heinhorst|Cannon|1993|pp = 1–9}}

''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'', a soil [[rhizosphere]] bacterium, can attach to plant cells and infect them with a [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]]-inducing [[Ti plasmid]] by [[horizontal gene transfer]], causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the [[Nif gene]] responsible for [[nitrogen fixation]] in the root nodules of [[Fabaceae|legumes]] and other plant species.{{sfn|Schell|Van Montagu|1977|pp = 159–179}} Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid is one of the main techniques for introduction of [[transgene]]s to plants and the creation of [[genetically modified crops]].

=== Epigenetics ===
{{Main|Epigenetics}}
[[Epigenetics]] is the study of heritable changes in [[gene expression|gene function]] that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying [[DNA sequence]]{{sfn|Bird|2007|pp = 396–398}} but cause the organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently.{{sfn|Hunter|2008}} One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by [[DNA methylation]] which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]] regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive [[cell division]]s for the remainder of the cell's life. Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be [[Heritability|heritable]],{{sfn|Spector|2012|p = 8}} while others are reset in the germ cells.

Epigenetic changes in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] biology serve to regulate the process of [[cellular differentiation]]. During [[morphogenesis]], [[totipotent]] [[stem cells]] become the various [[pluripotent]] [[cell line]]s of the [[embryo]], which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the [[zygote]], gives rise to the many different [[plant cell]] types including [[parenchyma]], [[vessel element|xylem vessel elements]], [[phloem]] sieve tubes, [[guard cell]]s of the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]], etc. as it continues to [[mitosis|divide]]. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.{{sfn|Reik|2007|pp = 425–432}}

Unlike animals, many plant cells, particularly those of the [[ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]], do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the [[ground tissue#Sclerenchyma|sclerenchyma]] and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as [[chromatin remodeling|chromatin remodelling]], an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.{{sfn|Costa|Shaw|2007|pp = 101–106}}

== Plant evolution ==
{{Main|Evolutionary history of plants}}
[[File:Rhynia stem.jpg|thumb|left|alt=colour image of a cross section of a fossil stem of ''Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii'', a Devonian vascular plant|Transverse section of a fossil stem of the Devonian vascular plant ''[[Rhynia]] gwynne-vaughani'']]
The [[chloroplast]]s of plants have a number of biochemical, structural and genetic similarities to [[cyanobacteria]], (commonly but incorrectly known as "blue-green algae") and are thought to be derived from an ancient [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiotic]] relationship between an ancestral [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cell]] and a [[Chloroplast#Cyanobacterial ancestor|cyanobacterial resident]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 552–581}}{{sfn|Copeland|1938|pp = 383–420}}{{sfn|Woese et al.|1977|pp = 305–311}}{{sfn|Cavalier-Smith|2004|pp = 1251–1262}}

The [[algae]] are a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group and are placed in various divisions, some more closely related to plants than others. There are many differences between them in features such as cell wall composition, biochemistry, pigmentation, chloroplast structure and nutrient reserves. The algal division [[Charophyta]], sister to the green algal division [[Chlorophyta]], is considered to contain the ancestor of true plants.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 617–654}} The Charophyte class [[Charophyceae]] and the land plant sub-kingdom [[Embryophyta]] together form the [[monophyletic]] group or clade [[Streptophytina]].{{sfn|Becker|Marin|2009|pp = 999–1004}}

Nonvascular land plants are [[embryophyte]]s that lack the vascular tissues [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]. They include [[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]] and [[hornwort]]s. [[Pteridophyte|Pteridophytic]] vascular plants with true xylem and phloem that reproduced by spores germinating into free-living gametophytes evolved during the Silurian period and diversified into several lineages during the late [[Silurian]] and early [[Devonian]]. Representatives of the lycopods have survived to the present day. By the end of the Devonian period, several groups, including the [[Lycopodiophyta|lycopods]], [[Sphenophyllales|sphenophylls]] and [[progymnosperm]]s, had independently evolved "megaspory" – their spores were of two distinct sizes, larger [[megaspore]]s and smaller microspores. Their reduced gametophytes developed from megaspores retained within the [[sporangium|spore-producing organs]] (megasporangia) of the sporophyte, a condition known as endospory. Seeds consist of an endosporic megasporangium surrounded by one or two sheathing layers ([[integument]]s). The young sporophyte develops within the seed, which on [[germination]] splits to release it. The earliest known seed plants date from the latest Devonian [[Famennian]] stage.{{sfn|Fairon-Demaret|1996|pp = 217–233}}{{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993|pp = 279–294}} Following the evolution of the seed habit, [[Spermatophyte|seed plants]] diversified, giving rise to a number of now-extinct groups, including [[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]], as well as the modern [[gymnosperm]]s and [[angiosperms]].{{sfn|Taylor|Taylor|Krings|2009|loc = chapter 13}} [[Gymnosperm]]s produce "naked seeds" not fully enclosed in an ovary; modern representatives include [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[cycad]]s, ''[[Ginkgo]]'', and [[Gnetophyta|Gnetales]]. Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed in a structure such as a [[Gynoecium|carpel]] or an [[ovary]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 720–750}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 751–785}} Ongoing research on the molecular phylogenetics of living plants appears to show that the angiosperms are a [[sister clade]] to the gymnosperms.{{sfn|Lee|Cibrian-Jaramillo|Kolokotronis|Katari|2011|p = e1002411}}

[[File:Plant physiology.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=A Venn diagram of the relationships between five key areas of plant physiology|Five of the key areas of study within plant physiology]]

Plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 278–279}} Chemicals obtained from the air, soil and water form the basis of all [[metabolism|plant metabolism]]. The energy of sunlight, captured by oxygenic photosynthesis and released by [[cellular respiration]], is the basis of almost all life. [[Phototroph|Photoautotrophs]], including all green plants, algae and [[cyanobacteria]] gather energy directly from sunlight by photosynthesis. [[Heterotroph]]s including all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria take in organic molecules produced by photoautotrophs and respire them or use them in the construction of cells and tissues.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 280–314}} [[Cellular respiration|Respiration]] is the oxidation of carbon compounds by breaking them down into simpler structures to release the energy they contain, essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 315–340}}

Molecules are moved within plants by transport processes that operate at a variety of [[spatial scale]]s. Subcellular transport of ions, electrons and molecules such as water and [[enzyme]]s occurs across [[cell membrane]]s. Minerals and water are transported from roots to other parts of the plant in the [[transpiration stream]]. [[Diffusion]], [[osmosis]], and [[active transport]] and [[mass flow]] are all different ways transport can occur.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 341–372}} Examples of [[plant nutrition|elements that plants need]] to transport are [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sulfur]]. In vascular plants, these elements are extracted from the soil as soluble ions by the roots and transported throughout the plant in the xylem. Most of the elements required for [[plant nutrition]] come from the chemical breakdown of soil minerals.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 373–398}}  [[Sucrose]] produced by photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant in the phloem and [[Plant physiology#Plant hormones|plant hormones]] are transported by a variety of processes.

{{Further|Plant hormone|Phytochrome}}

Plants are not passive, but respond to [[signal transduction|external signals]] such as light, touch, and injury by moving or growing towards or away from the stimulus, as appropriate. Tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost instantaneous collapse of leaflets of ''[[Mimosa pudica]]'', the insect traps of [[Venus flytrap]] and [[bladderwort]]s, and the pollinia of orchids.{{sfn|Darwin|1880|pp = 129–200}}

The hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by [[plant hormone]]s or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century. Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards [[heliotropism|light]]{{sfn|Darwin|1880|pp = 449–492}} and [[geotropism|gravity]], and concluded "It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle . . acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . . directing the several movements".{{sfn|Darwin|1880|p = 573}} About the same time, the role of [[auxin]]s (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist [[Frits Went]].{{sfn|Plant Hormones|2013}} The first known auxin, [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later.{{sfn|Went|Thimann|1937|pp = 110–112}} This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 411–412}} The finding in 1939 that plant [[callus (cell biology)|callus]] could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.{{sfn|Sussex|2008|pp = 1189–1198}}

[[Cytokinin]]s are a class of plant hormones named for their control of cell division or [[cytokinesis]]. The natural cytokinin [[zeatin]] was discovered in corn, ''[[Zea mays]]'', and is a derivative of the [[purine]] [[adenine]]. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 827–830}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 411–413}} The [[gibberelins]], such as [[Gibberelic acid]] are [[diterpene]]s synthesised from [[Acetyl-CoA carboxylase|acetyl CoA]] via the [[mevalonate pathway]]. They are involved in the promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering.{{sfn|Taiz|Zeiger|2002|pp = 461–492}} [[Abscisic acid]] (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from [[carotenoid]]s in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control [[abscission]].{{sfn|Taiz|Zeiger|2002|pp = 519–538}} [[Ethylene#Ethylene as a plant hormone|Ethylene]] is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from [[methionine]]. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission,{{sfn|Lin|Zhong|Grierson|2009|pp = 331–336}}{{sfn|Taiz|Zeiger|2002|pp = 539–558}} and it, or the synthetic growth regulator [[ethephon]] which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, [[pineapple]]s and other [[climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] crops.

Another class of [[phytohormone]]s is the [[jasmonate]]s, first isolated from the oil of ''[[Jasminum grandiflorum]]''{{sfn|Demole|Lederer|Mercier|1962||pp = 675–685}} which regulates wound responses in plants by unblocking the expression of genes required in the [[systemic acquired resistance]] response to pathogen attack.{{sfn|Chini|Fonseca|Fernandez|Adie|2007|pp = 666–671}}

In addition to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in a process known as [[photomorphogenesis]]. [[Phytochrome]]s are the [[Photoreceptor protein|photoreceptors]] in a plant that are sensitive to light.{{sfn|Roux|1984|pp = 25–29}}

[[Plant anatomy]] is the study of the structure of plant cells and tissues, whereas [[plant morphology]] is the study of their external form.{{sfn|Raven|Evert|Eichhorn|2005|p = 9}}
All plants are multicellular eukaryotes, their DNA stored in nuclei.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 433–467}}{{sfn|National Center for Biotechnology Information|2004}} The characteristic features of [[plant cell]]s that distinguish them from those of animals and fungi include a primary [[cell wall]] composed of the polysaccharides [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[pectin]], {{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 62–81}} larger [[vacuole]]s than in animal cells and the presence of [[plastid]]s with unique photosynthetic and biosynthetic functions as in the chloroplasts. Other plastids contain storage products such as starch ([[amyloplasts]]) or lipids ([[elaioplast]]s). Uniquely, [[streptophyte]] cells and those of the green algal order [[Trentepohliales]]{{sfn|López-Bautista|Waters|Chapman|2003|pp = 1715–1718}} divide by construction of a [[phragmoplast]] as a template for building a [[cell plate]] late in [[cytokinesis|cell division]].{{sfn|Lewis|McCourt|2004|pp=1535–1556}}

The bodies of [[vascular plant]]s including [[Lycopodiopsida|clubmosses]], [[fern]]s and  [[spermatophyte|seed plants]] ([[gymnosperm]]s and [[angiosperms]]) generally have aerial and subterranean subsystems. The [[shoot]]s consist of [[Plant stem|stems]] bearing green photosynthesising [[Leaf|leaves]] and reproductive structures. The underground vascularised [[root]]s bear [[root hairs]] at their tips and generally lack chlorophyll.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|p=739}} Non-vascular plants, the [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], [[hornworts]] and [[mosses]] do not produce ground-penetrating vascular roots and most of the plant participates in photosynthesis.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 607–608}} The [[sporophyte]] generation is nonphotosynthetic in liverworts but may be able to contribute part of its energy needs by photosynthesis in mosses and hornworts.{{sfn|Lepp|2012}}

The root system and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|p = 739}} Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing [[adventitious]] shoots or roots.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 812–814}} [[Stolons]] and [[tuber]]s are examples of shoots that can grow roots.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|p = 740}} Roots that spread out close to the surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 185–208}} In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, as is the case with ''[[Saintpaulia]]'',{{sfn|Mithila|Hall|Victor|Saxena|2003|pp = 408–414}} or even a single [[Cell (biology)|cell]] – which can dedifferentiate into a [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]] (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|pp = 812–814}}
In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or [[starch]],{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|p = 739}} as in [[sugar beet]]s and carrots.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 185–208}}

Stems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as [[Cactus|cacti]], food as in potato [[tubers]], or [[vegetative reproduction|reproduce vegetatively]] as in the [[stolons]] of [[strawberry#Cultivation|strawberry]] plants or in the process of [[layering]].{{sfn|Campbell|Reece|Urry|Cain|2008|p = 741}} Leaves gather sunlight and carry out [[photosynthesis]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 114–153}} Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 154–184}} [[Gymnosperm]]s, such as [[conifer]]s, [[cycad]]s, ''[[Ginkgo]]'', and [[gnetophyta|gnetophytes]] are seed-producing plants with open seeds.{{sfn|Capon|2005|p = 11}} [[Angiosperms]] are [[Spermatophyte|seed-producing plants]] that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 720–750}} Woody plants, such as [[azalea]]s and [[oak]]s, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary [[xylem]]) and bark (secondary [[phloem]] and [[Cork cambium|cork]]). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 209–243}} Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 244–277}}

Although reference to major morphological categories such as root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, one has to keep in mind that these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results.{{sfn|Sattler|Jeune|1992|pp = 249-269}} Furthermore, structures can be seen as processes, that is, process combinations.{{sfn|Sattler|1992|pp = 708-714}}

== Systematic botany ==
{{Further|Taxonomy (biology)}}
[[File:HerbPrepLG.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|alt=photograph of a botanist preparing plant specimens for the herbarium|A botanist preparing a plant specimen for mounting in the [[herbarium]]]]

Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history.{{sfn|Lilburn|Harrison|Cole|Garrity|2006}} It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and [[phylogenetics]]. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as [[genus|genera]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy (biology)|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]] – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than [[phenotype|superficial characteristics]]. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) and administered by the [[International Botanical Congress]].{{sfn|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2011|p = Preamble, para. 7}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528–551}}

[[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] [[Plant]]ae belongs to [[Domain (biology)|Domain]] [[Eukarya]] and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]] (or Division); [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]] (plural ''genera''); [[Species]]. The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528–551}} For example, the tiger lily is ''[[Lilium columbianum]]''. ''Lilium'' is the genus, and ''columbianum'' the [[Botanical name#Binary name|specific epithet]]. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528–55}}{{sfn|International Association for Plant Taxonomy|2006}}{{sfn|Silyn-Roberts|2000|p = 198}}

The evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]]. Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies. The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 438–444}} As an example, species of ''[[Pereskia]]'' are trees or bushes with prominent leaves. They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless [[cactus]] such as an ''[[Echinocactus]]''. However, both ''Pereskia'' and ''Echinocactus'' have spines produced from [[areoles]] (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 446–449}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp = 26–27}}

|footer=Although ''Pereskia'' is a tree with leaves, it has spines and areoles like a more typical cactus, such as ''Echinocactus''.}}
Judging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through [[convergent evolution]] in which characters have arisen independently. Some [[euphorbia]]s have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The [[Cladistics|cladistic method]] takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups ([[homoplasies]]) or those left over from ancestors ([[plesiomorphies]]) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor ([[apomorphies]]). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as [[cladogram]]s: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 442–450}}

From the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses molecular characters, particularly [[DNA]] sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. [[Clive A. Stace|Clive Stace]] describes this as having "direct access to the genetic basis of evolution."{{sfn|Stace|2010a|p = 104}} As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals. Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below – fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|p = 453}}

&lt;/div&gt;

In 1998, the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] published a [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] for flowering plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of [[angiosperms]], have now been answered.{{sfn|Burger|2013}} Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.{{sfn|Chase et al.|2003|pp = 399–436}} Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various [[Taxon|taxa]].{{sfn|Capon|2005|p = 223}} Technological developments such as computers and [[electron microscope]]s have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.{{sfn|Morton|1981|pp = 459–459}}

Tumours are characterized by genomic and epigenetic instability that alters the functions of many different molecules and networks in a single cell as well as altering the interactions with the local environment. Cancer systems biology approaches, therefore, are based on the use of computational and mathematical methods to decipher the complexity in tumorigenesis as well as cancer heterogeneity.

Cancer systems biology merges traditional basic and clinical cancer research with “exact” sciences, such as applied [[mathematics]], [[engineering]], and [[physics]]. It incorporates a spectrum of “omics” technologies ([[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[epigenomics]], etc.) and [[molecular imaging]], to generate computational algorithms and quantitative models&lt;ref name="genome_scale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis, NE|author2=Abdel-Haleem, AM|title=The evolution of genome-scale models of cancer metabolism|journal=Front.

Application of cancer systems biology include but are not limited to- elucidating critical cellular and molecular networks underlying cancer risk,initiation and progression; thereby promoting an alternative viewpoint to the traditional reductionist approach which has typically focused on characterizing single molecular aberrations.

== History ==

Cancer systems biology finds its roots in a number of events and realizations in biomedical research, as well as in technological advances. Historically cancer was identified, understood, and treated as a monolithic disease.  It was seen as a “foreign” component that grew as a homogenous mass, and was to be best treated by excision.  Besides the continued impact of surgical intervention, this simplistic view of cancer has drastically evolved. In parallel with the exploits of molecular biology, cancer research focused on the identification of critical oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in the etiology of cancer.  These breakthroughs revolutionized our understanding of molecular events driving cancer progression.  Targeted therapy may be considered the current pinnacle of advances spawned by such insights.

Despite these advances, many unresolved challenges remain, including the dearth of new treatment avenues for many cancer types, or the unexplained treatment failures and inevitable relapse in cancer types where targeted treatment exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garraway|author2=Jänne|title=Circumventing cancer drug resistance in the era of personalized medicine|journal=Cancer Discovery|year=2012|volume=2|issue=3|pages=214–226|pmid=22585993|doi=10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such mismatch between clinical results and the massive amounts of data acquired by omics technology highlights the existence of basic gaps in our knowledge of cancer fundamentals. Cancer Systems Biology is steadily improving our ability to organize information on cancer, in order to fill these gaps. Key developments include:

* The generation of comprehensive molecular datasets (genome, transcriptome, epigenomics, proteome, metabolome, etc.)

The practice of Cancer Systems Biology requires close physical integration between scientists with diverse backgrounds. Critical large-scale efforts are also underway to train a new workforce fluent in both the languages of biology and applied mathematics. At the translational level, Cancer Systems Biology should engender precision medicine application to cancer treatment.

* Modelling Cancer Growth and Development
Mathematical modeling can provide useful context for the rational design, validation and prioritization of novel cancer drug targets and their combinations. Network-based modeling and multi-scale modeling have begun to show promise in facilitating the process of effective cancer drug discovery. Using a systems network modeling approach, Schoerberl et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoeberl|first1=B|last2=Kudla|first2=A|last3=Masson|first3=K|last4=Kalra|first4=A|last5=Curley|first5=M|last6=Finn|first6=G|last7=Pace|first7=E|last8=Harms|first8=B|last9=Kim|first9=J|last10=Kearns|first10=J|last11=Fulgham|first11=A|last12=Burenkova|first12=O|last13=Grantcharova|first13=V|last14=Yarar|first14=D|last15=Paragas|first15=V|last16=Fitzgerald|first16=J|last17=Wainszelbaum|first17=M|last18=West|first18=K|last19=Mathews|first19=S|last20=Nering|first20=R|last21=Adiwijaya|first21=B|last22=Garcia|first22=G|last23=Kubasek|first23=B|last24=Moyo|first24=V|last25=Czibere|first25=A|last26=Nielsen|first26=UB|last27=MacBeath|first27=G|title=Systems biology driving drug development: from design to the clinical testing of the anti-ErbB3 antibody seribantumab (MM-121).|journal=NPJ systems biology and applications|date=2017|volume=3|pages=16034|doi=10.1038/npjsba.2016.34|pmid=28725482|pmc=5516865}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified a previously unknown, complementary and potentially superior mechanism of inhibiting the ErbB receptor signaling network. ErbB3 was found to be the most sensitive node, leading to Akt activation; Akt regulates many biological processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis and growth, which are all relevant to tumor progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Z|last2=Deisboeck|first2=TS|title=Mathematical modeling in cancer drug discovery.|journal=Drug Discovery Today|date=February 2014|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–50|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2013.06.015|pmid=23831857}}&lt;/ref&gt; This target driven modelling has paved way for first of its kind clinical trials. Bekkal et al. presented a nonlinear model of the dynamics of a cell population divided into proliferative and quiescent compartments. The proliferative phase represents the complete cell cycle (G (1)-S-G (2)-M) of a population committed to divide at its end. The asymptotic behavior of solutions of the nonlinear model is analysed in two cases, exhibiting tissue homeostasis or tumor exponential growth.

Furthermore, advances in hardware and software have enabled the realization of clinically feasible, quantitative multimodality imaging of tissue pathophysiology. Earlier efforts relating to multimodality imaging of cancer have focused on the integration of anatomical and functional characteristics, such as PET-CT and single-photon emission CT (SPECT-CT), whereas more-recent advances and applications have involved the integration of multiple quantitative, functional measurements (for example, multiple PET tracers, varied MRI contrast mechanisms, and PET-MRI), thereby providing a more-comprehensive characterization of the tumour phenotype. The enormous amount of complementary quantitative data generated by such studies is beginning to offer unique insights into opportunities to optimize care for individual patients. Although important technical optimization and improved biological interpretation of multimodality imaging findings are needed, this approach can already be applied informatively in clinical trials of cancer therapeutics using existing tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yankeelov|first1=TE|last2=Abramson|first2=RG|last3=Quarles|first3=CC|title=Quantitative multimodality imaging in cancer research and therapy.|journal=Nature Reviews.

{{Orphan|date=March 2017}}

''''Capacity theory''' is the theoretical approach that pulled researchers from Filter theories with Kahneman's published 1973 study, ''Attention and Effort'' (https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_hi_quality.pdf - bottom of page 7 of the book, page 14 of the pdf) positing attention was limited in overall capacity, that a person's ability to perform simultaneous tasks depends on how much "capacity" the jobs require.  Further researchers - Johnson and Heinz (1978) and Navon &amp; Gopher (1979) - went further with Kahneman's study.&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg, Ronald T. (2016). pp. 79-83.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Shalom Fisch used Kahneman's capacity theory, just as others did for their research, to published a paper on children's understanding of educational content on television.&lt;ref name=Fisch6391&gt;{{harvnb|Fisch|2000|pp=63&amp;ndash;91}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a communication theory based on model which is used to explain and predict how children learn from [[educational television programing]]. It is formed by combining [[cognitive psychology]] and [[LC4MP|limited capacity]] of working memory. Working memory is explained as having limited resources available for processing external information and when demands exceed capabilities, then the material will not be attended to.
The model attempts to explain how cognitive resources are allocated when individuals, particularly children, comprehend both the educational and the narrative content of an educational program
Capacity theory suggests that when educational content is tangential to the narrative content the two information sources compete with one another for limited resources in working memory. However, when the distance between educational content and narrative content is small, the process complement one another rather than compete for resources, therefore an individual is likely comprehend more.

== Three basic components of the capacity model ==
The capacity model consists of three basic components.
# ''Processing of narrative content''
# ''Processing of education content''
# ''Distance between narrative and educational content''

=== Processing of narrative content ===
Capacity model implies that television viewers will construct their understanding of the [[narrative content]] by accessing prior knowledge and draw inferences on the new material based on previous exposure. Theory and empirical research has supported the notion that people are using working memory to process information needed to follow the story line or plot.&lt;ref name=AndBry331354&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|Bryant|1983|pp=331&amp;ndash;354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins125150&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1983|pp=125&amp;ndash;150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HustonWright9991058&gt;{{harvnb|Huston|Wright|1997|pp=999&amp;ndash;1058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HustonWright10191020&gt;{{harvnb|Huston|Wright|1997|pp=1019&amp;ndash;1020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PalmerMacNeil2744&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|MacNeill|1991|pp=27&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PearlBouLaz2227&gt;{{harvnb|Pearl|Bouthilet|Lazar|1982|pp=22&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the audio/visual nature of television, individual program factors will influence how much demand is used. For example, a fast paced action sequence will require more working memory to follow the action than perhaps a slow dialogue between two characters.
This is best understood by breaking it down to two types of characteristics, viewer characteristics and program characteristics.

==== Viewer characteristics ====
* Viewer's prior knowledge – if an individual is familiar with the narrative content, such as knowing the characters or storyline, then cognitive demand will be low and more working memory will be made available.
* Story schema – ability to understand the basic components of a story and the hierarchy of events will help influence the amount of cognitive demand required.&lt;ref name=MeadowReev352374&gt;{{harvnb|Meadowcroft|Reeves|1989|pp352&amp;ndash;374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive abilities – individuals with higher intelligence and higher cognitive abilities will make more efficient use of cognitive resources when encoding the narrative.&lt;ref name=EckhardtWoodJacob636649&gt;{{harvnb|Eckhardt|Wood|Jacobvitz|1991|pp=636&amp;ndash;649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JacWoodAlbin219235&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobvitz|Wood|Albin|1991|pp=219&amp;ndash;235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interest in the story - the viewer's interest in the story will affect how much attention is paid to the narrative and therefore will influence how resources are allocated.

==== Program characteristics ====
Developmental research in text comprehension has found that young children can use schemata to process stories only when they are structured simply and clearly state causal linkages&lt;ref name=MandlerJohnson111151&gt;{{harvnb|Mandler|Johnson|1977|pp=111&amp;ndash;151}} cf. Meadowcroft &amp; Reeves, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complexity of the narrative - the number of events in the story and the connections among them will influence how much working memory is required. Studies have shown that children process stories only when they are simple in their construction and clearly show casual linkage. Long narratives with lots of complex chains will increase demands required for processing.&lt;ref name=MandlerJohnson111151/&gt;
* Structure of the Story - stories that are constructed in easily recognizable patterns, such as a beginning, middle, and end are easier to follow, thus reducing demand.
* Explicit vs inferred information - whether or not the information is clearly presented or if it is less clear, thus requiring making inference about the narrative, will affect the amount of cognitive processing required.

=== Processing educational content ===
The processing of educational content has not received as much attention as processing of narrative content. Many of the guiding principles in this section were developed out of speculation and then verified through current studies. As with the narrative content, there are viewer and program characteristics that effect comprehension.

==== Viewer characteristics ====
* Prior knowledge of content - similar to the processing of narrative content, previous exposure to educational information can reduce the amount of working memory required to process the information in children. This has been shown to be true in adults.
* Interest in content - viewers will be able to dedicate a greater pool of resources to information in they are interested in the content. This was suggested by testing children's comprehension of mathematical word problems. The study showed that comprehension was enhanced if the child was interested in the narrative context which the problem occurred in.&lt;ref name=Renninger228238&gt;{{harvnb|Renninger|1998|pp=222&amp;ndash;238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Program characteristics ====
* Clarity of presentation - the degree to which the information is clearly presented will decrease required resources for processing information.
* Explicitness of content - whether or not the content is clearly identifiable as educational material or if it hidden beneath the narrative will affect amount of cognition.

=== Distance ===
Distance is the final component of this model. The idea of distance separates this model from other cognitive processing models such as Limited Capacity. Distance referrers to the degree to which the educational content is integrated into the narrative. This concept has been dubbed "content on the plotline" by the Children's Television Workshop.&lt;ref name=FischEtAl&gt;{{harvnb|Fisch|Goodman|McCann|Rylander|Ross|1995|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HallWilliams&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|Williams|1993|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is best described as the role the content has in the story of events. Distance is not binary, but is best described in length as small or large.
* Small distance suggests that the narrative and educational content are related to one another and that the educational content is causally embedded into the plot.
* Large distance suggests that educational content is not involved in the story line and does not assist in moving the story forward. It may only be featured at low levels in the story hierarchy.

Understanding the effect distance has on processing will explain how certain content competes for attention. Large distances will require more resources due to the increase in competition, however resources are limited. The process used to encode, store, and retrieve narrative content is the same as educational content. When the narrative and educational content are intertwined, then it is said to be a small distance, thus reducing the amount of competition for limited resources. The parallel process responsible for comprehending narrative and educational content complement one another, thus increasing information retention.
- This model predicts that educational content will be better attended to when the distance from the narrative is small and has been shown in previous studies&lt;ref name=FischEtAl/&gt;

== Factors which influence processing of narrative and educational content ==
There are several factors that will influence the processing of narrative and educational content.
* Cognitive maturity of the child - studies have shown that cognitive capabilities develop in children at different ages.
* Prior exposure to the material - if the child has been exposed to the educational material before, cognitive demand will be lessened.
* Complexity of formal features - as mentioned previously, television has the opportunity to provide several audio and video features. Studies have shown that features such as fast program pacing may decrease processing capabilities.

== Governing principles ==
This theory is governed by several broad principles detailing the allocation of resources among the two content types.

===Narrative dominance===
This principle suggests that priority is given to comprehension of the narrative content over the educational content assuming all things are equal. This primarily occurs when the distance between the educational content and narrative content is large. Working memory will be devoted to narrative before educational content. This is largely due to the fact that people typically select television content for its entertainment value before its educational value. Secondly, narrative content is featured as the primary or “surface” contents, whereas educational content is secondary or “deep” content.

=== Relative availability of resources ===
Each individual will have various levels of resource ability. As with any type of content the individual is exposed to, there will always be a competition for resources. Several factors can increase or decrease the demands required for processing, such as pacing, graphics, audio, and other production features. When high demands are required for processing the narrative content of educational programming, then less resources will be available for educational content. This demand to process both sources can be reduced if the educational content and narrative content are closely related.

=== Voluntary allocation ===
Individuals will select media to achieve certain goals or objectives. As a result, an individual may choose to watch an educational program and consciously attempt to allocate more resources to the educational content rather than the narrative content. Studies have consistently shown that viewer’s reason for watching can affect at which level the narrative is recalled and understood.&lt;ref name=KwaitekWatkins&gt;{{harvnb|Kwaitek|Watkins|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SalomanLeigh&gt;{{harvnb|Saloman|Leigh|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research using this model has revealed that the same has been shown to occur with educational content. It should be understood that this model does not assume that the attention paid to the educational content will cause the viewer to abandon resources to the narrative.

Cell signaling has been most extensively studied in the context of human diseases and signaling between [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of a single organism. However, cell signaling may also occur between the cells of two different organisms. In many mammals, early [[embryo]] cells exchange signals with cells of the [[uterus]].&lt;ref name="Mohamed2005"&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main article|Endocrine system}}
Cell signaling can be classified to be mechanical and biochemical based on the type of the signal.
Mechanical signals are the forces exerted on the cell and the forces produced by the cell. These forces can both be sensed and responded by the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Callie Johnson |last2=Davidson |first2=Lance A. |date=2013 |title=The interplay between cell signalling and mechanics in developmental processes |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=733–744 |doi=10.1038/nrg3513 |issn=1471-0056 |pmc=4056017 |pmid=24045690 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v14/n10/full/nrg3513.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Biochemical signals are the biochemical molecules such as proteins, lipids, ions and gases. These signals can be categorized based on the distance between signaling and responder cells. Signaling within, between, and amongst cells is subdivided into the following classifications:
* ''[[Intracrine]]'' signals are produced by the target cell that stay within the target cell.
* ''[[Autocrine signalling|Autocrine]]'' signals are produced by the target cell, are secreted, and affect the target cell itself via receptors. Sometimes autocrine cells can target cells close by if they are the same type of cell as the emitting cell. An example of this are [[immune cell]]s.
* ''[[Juxtacrine signalling|Juxtacrine]]'' signals target adjacent (touching) cells. These signals are transmitted along cell membranes via protein or lipid components integral to the membrane and are capable of affecting either the emitting cell or cells immediately adjacent.
* ''[[Paracrine signalling|Paracrine]]'' signals target cells in the vicinity of the emitting cell. [[Neurotransmitter]]s represent an example.
* ''[[Endocrine system|Endocrine]]'' signals target distant cells. Endocrine cells produce hormones that travel through the [[circulatory system|blood]] to reach all parts of the body.

Cells communicate with each other via direct contact ([[juxtacrine signaling]]), over short distances ([[paracrine signaling]]), or over large distances and/or scales ([[endocrine system|endocrine signaling]]).

Some cell–cell communication requires direct [[cell–cell interaction|cell–cell contact]]. Some cells can form [[gap junction]]s that connect their [[cytoplasm]] to the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. In [[cardiac muscle]], gap junctions between adjacent cells allows for [[action potential]] propagation from the [[cardiac pacemaker]] region of the heart to spread and coordinately cause contraction of the heart.

The [[notch signaling]] mechanism is an example of [[juxtacrine signalling|juxtacrine signaling]] (also known as contact-dependent signaling) in which two adjacent cells must make physical contact in order to communicate. This requirement for direct contact allows for very precise control of cell [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] during embryonic development. In the worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', two cells of the developing [[gonad]] each have an equal chance of terminally differentiating or becoming a uterine precursor cell that continues to divide. The choice of which cell continues to divide is controlled by competition of cell surface signals. One cell will happen to produce more of a cell surface protein that activates the Notch [[#Receptors for cell signals|receptor]] on the adjacent cell. This activates a [[feedback loop]] or system that reduces Notch expression in the cell that will differentiate and that increases Notch on the surface of the cell that continues as a [[stem cell]].&lt;ref name="Greenwald1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenwald I |title=LIN-12/Notch signaling: lessons from worms and flies |journal=Genes Dev |volume=12 |issue=12 |pages=1751–62 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9637676 |url=http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9637676 |doi=10.1101/gad.12.12.1751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cell signals are carried by molecules that are released by one cell and move to make contact with another cell. ''[[Endocrine system|Endocrine]]'' signals are called [[hormone]]s. Hormones are produced by endocrine cells and they travel through the [[circulatory system|blood]] to reach all parts of the body. Specificity of signaling can be controlled if only some cells can respond to a particular hormone. ''[[Paracrine signalling|Paracrine]]'' signals such as [[retinoic acid]] target only cells in the vicinity of the emitting cell.&lt;ref name="Duester"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Duester G |title=Retinoic Acid Synthesis and Signaling during Early Organogenesis |journal=Cell |volume=134 |issue=6 |pages=921–31 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18805086 |pmc=2632951 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurotransmitter]]s represent another example of a paracrine signal. Some signaling molecules can function as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter. For example, [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] can function as hormones when released from the [[adrenal gland]] and are transported to the heart by way of the blood stream. Norepinephrine can also be produced by [[neuron]]s to function as a neurotransmitter within the brain.&lt;ref name="Cartford2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cartford MC, Samec A, Fister M, Bickford PC |title=Cerebellar norepinephrine modulates learning of delay classical eyeblink conditioning: Evidence for post-synaptic signaling via PKA |journal=Learn Mem |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=732–7 |year=2004 |pmid=15537737 |pmc=534701 |doi=10.1101/lm.83104 |url=http://www.learnmem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15537737}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estrogen]] can be released by the [[ovary]] and function as a hormone or act locally via paracrine or [[autocrine]] signaling.&lt;ref name="Jesmin2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jesmin S, Mowa CN, Sakuma I |title=Aromatase is abundantly expressed by neonatal rat penis but downregulated in adulthood |journal=J Mol Endocrinol |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=343–59 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15525594 |doi=10.1677/jme.1.01548 |url=http://jme.endocrinology-journals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15525594 |display-authors=etal }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active species of oxygen and [[nitric oxide]] can also act as cellular messengers.

==Cell signaling in multicellular organisms==
In a multicellular organism, signaling between cells occurs either through release into the [[extracellular space]], divided in [[paracrine]] signaling (over short distances) and [[endocrine]] signaling (over long distances), or by direct contact, known as [[juxtacrine signalling|juxtacrine signaling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|title=Developmental biology|year=2000|publisher=Sinauer Assoc.|location=Sunderland, Mass.|chapter=Juxtacrine Signaling|isbn=0878932437|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10072/?redirect-on-error=__HOME__|edition=6.|editor=NCBI bookshelf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autocrine]] signaling is a special case of paracrine signaling where the secreting cell has the ability to respond to the secreted signaling molecule.&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Alberts|title=Molecular biology of the cell|year=2002|editor=NCBI bookshelf|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=0815332181|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/|edition=4th|chapter=General Principles of Cell Communication|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synapse|Synaptic]] signaling is a special case of paracrine signaling (for [[chemical synapse]]s) or juxtacrine signaling (for [[electrical synapse]]s) between [[neuron]]s and target cells. Signaling molecules interact with a target cell as a [[ligand]] to [[cell surface receptor]]s, and/or by entering into the cell through its [[cell membrane|membrane]] or [[endocytosis]] for [[intracrine]] signaling. This generally results in the activation of [[second messenger]]s, leading to various physiological effects.

A particular molecule is generally used in diverse modes of signaling, and therefore a classification by mode of signaling is not possible. At least three important classes of signaling molecules are widely recognized, although non-exhaustive and with imprecise boundaries, as such membership is non-exclusive and depends on the context:
*[[Hormone]]s are the major signaling molecules of the [[endocrine system]], though they often regulate each other's secretion via local signaling (e.g. [[islet of Langerhans]] cells), and most are also expressed in tissues for local purposes (e.g. [[angiotensin]]) or failing that, [[protein family|structurally related]] molecules are (e.g. [[PTHrP]]).
*[[Neurotransmitter]]s are signaling molecules of the [[nervous system]], also including [[neuropeptide]]s and [[neuromodulator]]s. Neurotransmitters like the [[catecholamine]]s are also secreted by the endocrine system into the systemic circulation.
*[[Cytokine]]s are signaling molecules of the [[immune system]], with a primary paracrine or juxtacrine role, though they can during significant immune responses have a strong presence in the circulation, with systemic effect (altering [[iron metabolism]] or [[body temperature]]). [[Growth factor]]s can be considered as cytokines or a different class.

Signaling molecules can belong to several chemical classes: [[lipid]]s, [[phospholipid]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[monoamine]]s, [[protein]]s, [[glycoprotein]]s, or [[gas]]es. Signaling molecules binding surface receptors are generally large and [[hydrophilic]] (e.g. [[TRH]], [[Vasopressin]], [[Acetylcholine]]), while those entering the cell are generally small and [[hydrophobic]] (e.g. [[glucocorticoid]]s, [[thyroid hormone]]s, [[cholecalciferol]], [[retinoic acid]]), but important exceptions to both are numerous, and a same molecule can act both via surface receptor or in an intracrine manner to different effects.&lt;ref name=bruce/&gt; In intracrine signaling, once inside the cell, a signaling molecule can bind to [[intracellular receptor]]s, other elements, or stimulate [[enzyme]] activity (e.g. gasses). The intracrine action of [[peptide hormone]]s remains a subject of debate.&lt;ref name="pmid10523322"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Re|first=R|title=The nature of intracrine peptide hormone action|journal=Hypertension|date=October 1999|volume=34|issue=4 Pt 1|pages=534–8|pmid=10523322|doi=10.1161/01.HYP.34.4.534|url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/34/4/534.full|access-date=2014-01-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402074946/http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/34/4/534.full#|archive-date=2016-04-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydrogen sulfide#Function in the body|Hydrogen sulfide]] is produced in small amounts by some cells of the human body and has a number of biological signaling functions.

==Receptors for cell motility and differentiation==
Cells receive information from their neighbors through a class of proteins known as [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]. [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch]] is a cell surface protein that functions as a receptor. Animals have a small set of [[gene]]s that code for signaling proteins that interact specifically with Notch receptors and stimulate a response in cells that express Notch on their surface. Molecules that activate (or, in some cases, inhibit) receptors can be classified as hormones, [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[cytokines]], and [[growth factors]], in general called [[Ligand (biochemistry)|receptor ligands]]. Ligand receptor interactions such as that of the Notch receptor interaction, are known to be the main interactions responsible for cell signaling mechanisms and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=Cooper GM.

As shown in Figure 2 (above; left), [[Notch signaling pathway|notch]] acts as a receptor for ligands that are expressed on adjacent cells. While some receptors are cell surface proteins, others are found inside cells. For example, [[estrogen]] is a [[hydrophobic]] molecule that can pass through the [[lipid bilayer]] of the [[cell membrane|membrane]]s. As part of the [[endocrine system]], intracellular [[estrogen receptor]]s from a variety of cell types can be activated by estrogen produced in the [[ovary|ovaries]].

For several types of intercellular signaling molecules that are unable to permeate the hydrophobic cell membrane due to their hydrophilic nature, the target receptor is expressed on the membrane. When such a signaling molecule activates its receptor, the signal is carried into the cell usually by means of a second messenger such as [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Goh SL, Looi Y, Shen H, Fang J, Bodner C, Houle M, Ng AC, Screaton RA, Featherstone M |title=Transcriptional Activation by MEIS1A in Response to Protein Kinase A Signaling Requires the Transducers of Regulated CREB Family of CREB Co-activators|journal=J Biol Chem|date=2009-07-10|volume=284|issue=28|pages=18904–12|pmid=19473990|doi=10.1074/jbc.M109.005090|pmc=2707216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18200529"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wojtal KA, Hoekstra D, Van IJzendoorn SC |title=cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and the dynamics of epithelial cell surface domains: moving membranes to keep in shape|journal=BioEssays|date=February 2008|volume=30|issue=2|pages=146–55|pmid=18200529|doi=10.1002/bies.20705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signaling pathways==

[[File:MAPKpathway diagram.svg|thumb|right|Figure 3. Key components of a signal transduction pathway ([[MAPK/ERK pathway]] shown)]]
{{further|List of signalling pathways}}

In some cases, receptor activation caused by ligand binding to a receptor is directly coupled to the cell's response to the ligand. For example, the neurotransmitter [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] can activate a cell surface receptor that is part of an [[ion channel]]. GABA binding to a [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] on a neuron opens a [[chloride]]-selective ion channel that is part of the receptor. GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation allows negatively charged chloride ions to move into the neuron, which inhibits the ability of the neuron to produce [[action potential]]s. However, for many cell surface receptors, ligand-receptor interactions are not directly linked to the cell's response. The activated receptor must first interact with other proteins inside the cell before the ultimate [[Physiology|physiological]] effect of the ligand on the cell's behavior is produced. Often, the behavior of a chain of several interacting cell proteins is altered following receptor activation. The entire set of cell changes induced by receptor activation is called a [[signal transduction]] mechanism or pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dinasarapu AR|title=Signaling gateway molecule pages—a data model perspective |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=1736–1738 |year=2011 |pmid=21505029|doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr190 |pmc=3106186|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Notch-mediated signaling, the signal transduction mechanism can be relatively simple. As shown in Figure 2, activation of Notch can cause the Notch protein to be altered by a [[protease]]. Part of the Notch protein is released from the cell surface membrane and takes part in [[gene regulation]]. Cell signaling research involves studying the spatial and temporal dynamics of both receptors and the components of signaling pathways that are activated by receptors in various cell types.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A more complex signal transduction pathway is shown in Figure 3. This pathway involves changes of [[protein–protein interaction]]s inside the cell, induced by an external signal. Many growth factors bind to receptors at the cell surface and stimulate cells to progress through the [[cell cycle]] and [[Cell division|divide]]. Several of these receptors are [[kinase]]s that start to phosphorylate themselves and other proteins when binding to a ligand. This [[phosphorylation]] can generate a binding site for a different protein and thus induce protein–protein interaction. In Figure 3, the ligand (called [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF)) binds to the receptor (called [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]]). This activates the receptor to phosphorylate itself. The phosphorylated receptor binds to an [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor protein]] ([[GRB2]]), which couples the signal to further downstream signaling processes. For example, one of the signal transduction pathways that are activated is called the [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAPK) pathway. The signal transduction component labeled as "MAPK" in the pathway was originally called "ERK," so the pathway is called the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]]. The MAPK protein is an enzyme, a [[protein kinase]] that can attach [[phosphate]] to target proteins such as the [[transcription factor]] [[C-myc|MYC]] and, thus, alter gene transcription and, ultimately, cell cycle progression. Many cellular proteins are activated downstream of the growth factor receptors (such as EGFR) that initiate this signal transduction pathway.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Some signaling transduction pathways respond differently, depending on the amount of signaling received by the cell. For instance, the [[hedgehog (cell signaling)|hedgehog protein]] activates different genes, depending on the amount of hedgehog protein present.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Complex multi-component signal transduction pathways provide opportunities for feedback, signal amplification, and interactions inside one cell between multiple signals and signaling pathways.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Intraspecies and interspecies signaling==
Molecular signaling can occur between different organisms, whether [[unicellular]] or multicellular. The emitting organism produces the signaling molecule, secretes it into the environment, where it diffuses, and it is sensed or internalized by the receiving organism. In some cases of interspecies signaling, the emitting organism can actually be a [[Host (biology)|host]] of the receiving organism, or vice versa.

Intraspecies signaling occurs especially in [[bacteria]], [[yeast]], [[social insect]]s, but also many [[vertebrate]]s. The signaling molecules used by multicellular organisms are often called [[pheromone]]s.  They can have such purposes as alerting against danger, indicating food supply, or assisting in reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tirindelli|first=R|author2=Dibattista, M |author3=Pifferi, S |author4= Menini, A |title=From pheromones to behavior|journal=Physiological Reviews|date=July 2009|volume=89|issue=3|pages=921–56|doi=10.1152/physrev.00037.2008|pmid=19584317|url=http://physrev.physiology.org/content/89/3/921.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unicellular organisms such as bacteria, signaling can be used to 'activate' peers from a [[Dormancy|dormant state]], enhance [[virulence]], defend against [[bacteriophage]]s, etc.&lt;ref name="pmid9671779"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mukamolova|first=GV|author2=Kaprelyants, AS |author3=Young, DI |author4=Young, M |author5= Kell, DB |title=A bacterial cytokine|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jul 21, 1998|volume=95|issue=15|pages=8916–21|pmid=9671779|pmc=21177|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.15.8916}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[quorum sensing]], which is also found in social insects, the multiplicity of individual signals has the potentiality to create a positive feedback loop, generating coordinated response.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5227">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''circuit''' is a [[model of computation]] in which input values proceed through a sequence of gates, each of which computes a [[function (computer science)|function]]. Circuits of this kind provide a generalization of [[Boolean circuit]]s and a mathematical model for [[digital logic]] circuits. Circuits are defined by the gates they contain and the values the gates can produce.  For example, the values in a Boolean circuit are [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values, and the circuit includes [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[logical disjunction|disjunction]], and [[logical negation|negation]] gates.  The values in an [[integer circuit]] are [[set (mathematics)|set]]s of [[integer]]s and the gates compute [[set union]], [[set intersection]], and [[set complement]], as well as the [[arithmetic operation]]s [[addition]] and [[multiplication]].

== Formal definition ==
A circuit is a triple &lt;math&gt;(M, L, G)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a set of values,
* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a set of gate labels, each of which is a function from &lt;math&gt;M^{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for some non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of inputs to the gate), and
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[labelled graph|labelled]] [[directed acyclic graph]] with labels from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

The vertices of the graph are called ''gates''. For each gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of [[in-degree]] &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; can be labeled by an element &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;M^{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Terminology ===
The gates of in-degree 0 are called ''inputs'' or ''leaves''. The gates of out-degree 0 are called ''outputs''. If there is an edge from gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to gate &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in the graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''child'' of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. We suppose there is an order on the vertices of the graph, so we can speak of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th child of a gate when &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is less than the out-degree of the gate.

The ''size'' of a circuit is the number of nodes of a circuit. The ''depth of a gate'' &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the [[longest path]] in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; beginning at &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; up to an output gate. In particular, the gates of out-degree 0 are the only gates of depth 1. The ''depth of a circuit'' is the maximum depth of any gate. 

''Level &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' is the set of all gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. A ''levelled circuit'' is a circuit in which the edges to gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; comes only from gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i + 1&lt;/math&gt; or from the inputs. In other words, edges only exist between adjacent levels of the circuit. The ''width'' of a levelled circuit is the maximum size of any level.

=== Evaluation ===
The exact value &lt;math&gt;V(g)&lt;/math&gt; of a gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with in-degree &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and label &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is defined recursively for all gates &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
V(g) = 
\begin{cases}
  l &amp; \text{if } g \text{ is an input} \\
  l(V(g_1), \dotsc, V(g_i)) &amp; \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where each &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; is a parent of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The value of the circuit is the value of each of the output gates.

== Circuits as functions ==
The labels of the leaves can also be variables which take values in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. If there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; leaves, then the circuit can be seen as a function from  &lt;math&gt;M^{n}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. It is then usual to consider a family of circuits &lt;math&gt;(C_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;, a sequence of circuits indexed by the integers where the circuit &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables. Families of circuits can thus be seen as functions from &lt;math&gt;M^{*}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

The notions of size, depth and width can be naturally extended to families of functions, becoming functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;; for example, &lt;math&gt;size(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th circuit of the family. 

== Complexity and algorithmic problems ==

Computing the output of a given [[Boolean circuit]] on a specific input is [[P-complete]] problem. If the input is an [[integer circuit]], however, it is unknown whether this problem is [[decidable language|decidable]].

[[Circuit complexity]] attempts to classify [[Boolean function]]s with respect to the size or depth of circuits that can compute them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7898">The '''Construction Management Association of America''' ('''CMAA''') is a non-profit and non-governmental, professional association serving the [[construction management]] industry.  The Association was formed in 1982. Current membership is more than 14,000, including individual CM/PM practitioners, corporate members, and construction owners in both public and private sectors, along with academic and associate members. CMAA has 29 regional chapters.&lt;ref&gt;CMAA Website http://cmaanet.org/about-cmaa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards of Practice==
CMAA published the most recent revision of its ''Construction Management Standards of Practice'' in 2015. The SOP has been published and updated regularly by CMAA since the 1980s. It outlines standards for professional CM services in the areas of:
* Project Management
* Cost Management
* Time Management
* Quality Management
* Contract Administration
* Safety Management
* Program Management
* Sustainability
* Risk Management
* Building Information Modeling

==Certification==
According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, there is a growing movement toward [[certification]] of [[construction]] managers.&lt;ref&gt;''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition'', Department of Labor, Construction Managers http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos005.htm&lt;/ref&gt; CMAA established a voluntary certification program for construction managers, known as the Certified Construction Manager (CCM) program.The Construction Manager Certification Institute (CMCI)was established by CMAA to oversee the organization's certification program. In 2006, the CCM program was accredited by the [[American National Standards Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;"CMAA's Certification Program Wins Accreditation from ANSI" ''Engineering News-Record'' http://enr.ecnext.com/coms2/article_necoar060410b&lt;/ref&gt; under the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 17024, which recognizes certification programs for conformity assessment or a "demonstration that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person or body are fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;American National Standards Institute https://www.ansica.org/wwwversion2/outside/&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCM certification requires individuals to possess a requisite amount of experience and/or education. The eligibility requirements are:

1. Forty-eight months' experience as a CM in the qualifying areas as defined by the Qualifications Matrix and 2. One of the following:

*An undergraduate (4-year BA/BS level) or graduate degree in [[construction management]], [[architecture]], [[engineering]] or [[construction science]].
*A 2-year undergraduate degree (AA/AS level) or certificate in construction management, architecture, engineering or construction science plus 4 years' experience in general design/construction. (This experience is in addition to the 48-month CM requirement.)
*No degree/certificate in construction management, architecture, engineering or construction science plus 8 years' experience in general design/construction. (This experience is in addition to the 48-month CM requirement.)

In addition, two reference letters from a client or owner are required; they can be from any two projects that a candidate is documenting as part of their 48-month requirement. Finally, the candidate must pass the certification exam.

Most applicants are certified within 4 to 7 months of submitting their applications. The length of time it takes to become certified depends upon how quickly a candidate can submit a complete application including project documentation, how quickly the references respond, and how quickly a candidate can take and pass the CCM exam.

In 2013, the Construction Industry Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.construction-institute.org Construction Industry Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Texas adopted the CCM as "a value-adding credential" following a joint effort to compare and harmonize CII's Construction Best Practices with the CMAA SOP, and to assure that the CCM examination measured and recognized mastery of the Best Practices.

==Education==
In 2013, CMAA became a member society of ABET, formerly the Accreditation Board for Engineering Technologies, the leading organization accrediting undergraduate and graduate education programs in engineering and related fields. ABET has introduced a new accreditation for undergraduate programs in Construction Management, with program-specific criteria adopted in 2015.

==Advocacy==
CMAA does host an advocacy program to represent the construction management industry before the United States Congress, federal agencies, state and local governments, and industry stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;CMAA Website: Government Affairs http://cmaanet.org/government-affairs&lt;/ref&gt; CMAA is active in several industry coalitions advocating investment in infrastructure and other industry interests.

==College of Fellows==

A designation CMAA awards to certain members who have proven to be industry leaders and "who have made significant contributions to their organizations, the industry and their profession," according to CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;Members of the CMAA [http://cmaanet.org/college-fellows College of Fellows] http://cmaanet.org/fellows&lt;/ref&gt; The College of Fellows meet consistently to discuss CM standards and issues facing the profession. The College also produces industry topic white papers and all members are particularly active in the association, often having served as past national presidents or in other leadership roles.

==Publications==
The association produces several publications, including the ''Construction Management Standards of Practice'' which defines the standards and practices of the construction management profession. Other CMAA publications include a bi-monthly newsletter, the ''CM Advisor''.

==Events==
CMAA hosts two industry events every year for the construction management profession.

CMAA's signature event is its '''National Conference &amp; Trade Show'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmaanet.org/nationalconference National Conference &amp; Trade Show]&lt;/ref&gt; held every fall.The national conference offers multiple seminars which count toward CCM certification or renewal, as well as Continuing Education Units for a variety of purposes. The conference also includes an awards ceremony known as the Project Achievement Awards. CMAA designates a panel of judges to evaluate and select entries of projects with the most significant contributions to the construction management industry.&lt;ref&gt;CMAA Project Achievement Awards {{cite web |url=http://cmaanet.org/cmaaprojectachievementawards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026025619/http://cmaanet.org/cmaaprojectachievementawards |archivedate=2010-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMAA's '''Capital Projects Symposium''' is held every spring. The Symposium is designed for as a high level exploration of trends and issues affecting the delivery of capital projects and programs.

CMAA has also conducted regular surveys of owner attitudes, preferences, needs and expectations across the industry, along with research into CM/PM fees, adoption of technology, workforce concerns and other topics.

==Major issues==

===Cultural property during armed conflict===
Two major treaties have dealt with the issue of cultural heritage protection during armed conflict:
* [[Roerich Pact]] of 1935, amongst the [[Pan American Union]]
* [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] of 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970525145320/http://www.icomos.org/hague/ |archivedate=1997-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; superseding the Roerich Pact.

===Repatriation and looting===

'''Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2''' ('''eIF2''') is a [[eukaryotic initiation factor]]. It is required for most forms of eukaryotic [[Translation (biology)|translation]] initiation. eIF2 mediates the binding of [[tRNA]]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt; to the ribosome in a [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]]-dependent manner. eIF2 is a heterotrimer consisting of an [[EIF2S1|alpha]] (also called subunit 1), a [[EIF2S2|beta]] (subunit 2), and a [[EIF2S3|gamma]] (subunit 3) subunit.

Once the initiation phase has completed, eIF2 is released from the ribosome bound to [[Guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] as an inactive binary complex. To participate in another round of translation initiation, this GDP must be exchanged for GTP.

==Function==
[[Image:Eukaryotic initiation.png |thumb|right |400px |The process of initiation of translation in eukaryotes with eIF2 in light-green. Other factors are shown, too.]]
eIF2 is an essential factor for protein synthesis that forms a ternary complex (TC) with [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and the initiator [[Methionine|Met]]-[[tRNA]]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt;. After its formation, the TC binds the [[Eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S)|40S ribosomal subunit]] to form the [[43S preinitiation complex]] (43S PIC). 43S PIC assembly is believed to be stimulated by the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|initiation factors]] [[eIF1]], [[eIF1AX|eIF1A]], and the [[eIF3]] complex according to ''in vitro'' experiments. The 43S PIC then binds [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] that has previously been unwound by the [[eIF4F]] complex. The 43S PIC and the eIF4F proteins form a new 48S complex on the mRNA, which starts searching along the mRNA for the [[start codon]] (AUG). Upon base pairing of the AUG-codon with the Met-tRNA, [[eIF5]] (which is a [[GTPase-activating protein]]) is recruited to the complex and induces eIF2 to hydrolyse its GTP. This causes eIF2-GDP to be released from this 48S complex and translation begins after recruitment of the [[60S]] ribosomal sub-unit and formation of the [[80S]] initiation complex. Finally, with the help of the [[Guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] [[eIF2B]],&lt;ref&gt;eIF2B consists of the sub-units [[EIF2B1]], [[EIF2B2]], [[EIF2B3]], [[EIF2B4]], [[EIF2B5]]&lt;/ref&gt; the GDP in eIF2 is exchanged for a GTP and the ternary complex reforms for a new round of translation initiation.

==Structure==
eIF2 is a heterotrimer of a total molar mass of 126 [[Dalton (unit)|kDa]] that is composed of the three sub-units: [[EIF2S1|α]] (sub-unit 1), [[EIF2S2|β]] (sub-unit 2), and [[EIF2S3|γ]] (sub-unit 3). 
The sequences of all three sub-units are highly conserved (pairwise amino acid identities for each sub-unit range from 47–72% when comparing the proteins of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'').

The '''α-subunit''' contains the main target for [[phosphorylation]], a [[serine]] at position 51. It also contains a S1 motif domain, which is a potential RNA binding-site. Therefore, the α-subunit can be considered the regulatory subunit of the trimer.

The '''β-subunit''' contains multiple phosphorylation sites (residues 2, 13, 67, 218). What is important to consider is that there are also three [[lysine]] clusters in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which are important for the interaction with eIF2B. Moreover, the sequence of the protein comprises a [[zinc-finger|zinc finger motif]] that was shown to play a role in both ternary complex and 43S preinitiation complex formation. There are also two guanine nucleotide-binding sequences that have not been shown to be involved in the regulation of eIF2 activity. The β-subunit is also believed to interact with both tRNA and mRNA.

The '''γ-sub-unit''' comprises three guanine nucleotide-binding sites and is known to be the main docking site for GTP/GDP. It also contains a tRNA-binding cavity that has been shown by [[X-ray crystallography]]. A zinc knuckle motif is able to bind one Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation.&lt;ref name="pmid16153175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14688270"&gt;

eIF2 activity is regulated by a mechanism involving both guanine nucleotide exchange and [[phosphorylation]]. Phosphorylation takes place at the α-subunit, which is a target for a number of [[Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase|serine kinases]] that phosphorylate [[serine]] 51. Those kinases act as a result of stress such as amino acid deprivation ([[EIF2AK4|GCN2]]), ER stress ([[EIF2AK3|PERK]]), the presence of dsRNA ([[Protein kinase R|PKR]]) heme deficiency ([[Heme-regulated inhibitor kinase|HRI]]), or [[interferon]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once phosphorylated, eIF2 shows increased affinity for its [[Guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] eIF2B. However, eIF2B is able to exchange GDP for GTP only if eIF2 is in its unphosphorylated state. Phosphorylated eIF2, however, due to its stronger binding, acts as an inhibitor of its own GEF (eIF2B). Since the cellular concentration of eIF2B is much lower than that of eIF2, even a small amount of phosphorylated eIF2 can completely abolish eIF2B activity by sequestration. Without the GEF, eIF2 can no longer be returned to its active (GTP-bound) state. As a consequence, translation comes to a halt since initiation is no longer possible without any available ternary complex. Furthermore, low concentration of ternary complex allows the expression of GCN4 (starved condition), which, in turn, results in increased activation of amino acid synthesis genes&lt;ref name="pmid10216940"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2687263"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16153175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11042214"/&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;

==Disease==
Since eIF2 is essential for most forms of translation initiation and therefore protein synthesis, defects in eIF2 are often lethal. The protein is highly conserved among evolutionary remote species - indicating a large impact of mutations on cell viability. Therefore, no diseases directly related to mutations in eIF2 can be observed. However, there are many illnesses caused by down-regulation of eIF2 through its upstream kinases. For example, increased concentrations of active PKR and inactive (phosphorylated) eIF2 were found in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]], and [[Huntington's disease|Huntington’s]] disease. There is also one proven example of a disease related to the GEF eIF2B. Mutations in all of the five subunits of eIF2B could be linked with [[leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter|leukoencephalopathy]], an illness that causes the brain’s white matter to disappear. It is still not fully understood why only brain cells seem to be affected by these defects. Potentially reduced levels of unstable regulatory proteins might play a role in the development of the diseases mentioned.&lt;ref name="pmid16153175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17496426"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14663">The '''Engineering, Science, and Management War Training''' program ('''ESMWT''') was one of the largest and most productive educational activities in America's history. It was perhaps only second to the [[G.I. Bill]] (officially the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944) in its scope and productivity.

Sometimes referred to as an "experiment in streamlined higher education", this government-sponsored program provided, without charge, college-grade courses for large numbers of Americans to fill urgently needed technical and scientific civilian positions just prior to and during World War II. College-grade was officially defined as "work of an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students."

With successive designations of Engineering Defense Training (EDT), Engineering, Science, and Management Defense Training (ESMDT), and ESMWT, the program was operated by the U.S. Office of Education from October 1940 through June 1945, with 227 colleges and universities providing about 68,000 courses for close to 1,800,000 students at a total cost of some $60 million ($940 million today's dollars).&lt;ref&gt;Cardozier, V. R.; ''Colleges and Universities in World War II,'' Praeger Publishers, 1993, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In mid-1940, before America officially entered World War II, it was brought to the attention of [[U.S. Congress]] that the civilian effort supporting the expected conflict would require far more engineers than were then available or could be produced through normal programs at colleges and universities. As part of the budget preparation, Congress tasked [[John W. Studebaker]], then [[U.S. Commissioner of Education]] and head of the [[Office of Education]] (predecessor of the [[United States Department of Education]]), to develop a program to help alleviate this crisis.

Studebaker asked Andrey A. Potter, Dean of Engineering at [[Purdue University]], to assist in developing this program and in  preparing a proposal to Congress.  A National Advisory Committee – composed of academic leaders and industry officials – first met on September 20–21, 1940. On October 9, a bill authoring the Engineering Defense Training (EDT) program with initial funding of $9 million (equivalent to $138 million in 2008) was passed by Congress and quickly signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

The bill authorized the Office of Education to contract with engineering schools throughout the U.S. to offer "intensive courses of college grade, designed to meet the shortage of engineers in activities essential to national defense."  Roy A. Seaton, Dean of Engineering at [[Kansas State College]], was appointed to direct the program.  Twenty-two regional advisors, each a prominent engineering educator, served without pay as coordinators. 

Courses under the EDT program began on December 9, 1940.  During the remainder of the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1941, about 120,800 individuals enrolled in 2,260 courses offered by 144 institutions.  

In July 1941, the Labor-Federal Security Appropriations Act, authorized the addition of chemistry, physics, and production-related courses to form an integrated ESMDT program. Funding was increased to $17.5 million ($270 million equivalent in 2008), and Dean George W. Case from the University of New Hampshire, replaced Seaton as the program director. During the next year, enrollment increased to nearly 450,000 men and women in about 7,800 courses offered by 196 colleges and universities. 

After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] (December 7, 1941) and the entry of the U.S. into World War II, the War-Time Commission was formed within the Department of Education to be responsible for this and other special training activities. The program was again renamed, becoming ESMWT, and continued as such through June 1945.  The annual enrollment in ESMWT averaged nearly 600,000 in some 13,000 courses.  Ultimately, 215 colleges and universities participated, with the offerings given in more than 1,000 towns and cities.

==Courses and academic credit==

The primary objective of the program was to prepare persons for professional positions in defense activities. The authorization required the courses to be of "an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students", distinguishing them from offerings of trade or technical schools. They were limited to engineering, physics, chemistry, and management subjects directly needed in defense activities

It is noted that many of the ESMWT courses, although of "college grade" at that time, might not be recognized as such in engineering and science programs today. At most colleges and universities in the early 1940s, engineering education greatly emphasized practical applications as opposed to theoretical analysis. It was somewhat the same in many undergraduate physics and chemistry programs.

Although there might be progressively higher-level courses in a subject, each ESMWT course was to be complete in itself and designed to convey some stated, applicable knowledge set. While prerequisites were listed for courses, these were mainly to indicate the background needed to understand the subject matter, and the pursuit of a course was not limited to persons having these prerequisites.

The participating colleges and universities were fully responsible for determining the local needs and developing courses to meet these needs. The relationship of these courses to the regular courses in a degree program was also under the responsibility of the offering institution.

Regular faculty members taught most of the courses. Although requiring considerable preparation, this was welcome work for most professors; between the draft and volunteering, college enrollment was a small fraction of normal. Some courses required instructors to have a highly specialized knowledge, and practitioners from industry were then used.

The matter of granting academic course credit for the special courses was an issue from the beginning. The Office of Education recommended against academic credit, reasioning that since the courses were paid by the government, this might "constitute a Federal subsidy to the participating college", a forbidden practice in that day. It was recommended, however, that knowledge of a subject gained through these courses be recognized, by examination or otherwise, for students in regular college programs, allowing them to excused from that subject, with or without credit.  

The Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD), then the accrediting body for engineering programs and predecessor of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET), also had reservations concerning academic credit. Following much debate, it was left to each school to make any credit-related decisions and, in the end, most decided against directly granting academic credit, primarily citing the imbalance of applications over theory in most ESMWT courses.

After being prepared by the offering institution, course outlines, schedules, and other information were submitted to the ESMWT Washington staff for approval, and the cognizant school was required to permanently maintain the same type of records on presented courses as those kept in regular academic programs.

==Students and recognition==

By law, admission to ESMWT courses was open to students without regard to age, sex, or race. With this, and without enforcement of prerequisites, there was a great diversity of students in the various offerings. It was not uncommon to find students in their early teens using the ESMWT program to accelerate their entry into engineering and science jobs. On the other end of the age spectrum, many of the students were in mid-life, preparing for a change of work field or refreshing their earlier education.

Perhaps the greatest diversity was in the number of female students. Prior to the 1940s, there were few women working in industry science and even less in engineering. The entry of women into defense jobs is well known through "[[Rosie the Riveter]]", but those in wartime engineering and related work are not often recognized; however, thousands entered professional work after being prepared through this program.

Under the initial EDT, women constituted less than 1 percent. With the addition of science and management courses, there were about 9 percent under ESMDT. After the start of the war and ESMWT, the numbers participating in the program increased to 22 percent. Many engineering schools that had earlier been all-male, first accepted women when they began the program. Conversely, a number of previously female colleges – including [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Skidmore College]], and [[Wellesley College]] – participated in the program and had their first male students. (Some of these schools later reverted to all-female).

Throughout the program, about 75 percent of the enrollments were in engineering subjects. After a series of courses in a particular subject area, many of the students, especially those having an earlier background in science and/or mathematics, were placed in regular engineering positions with industry or government agencies. These were sometimes referred to as "instant engineers." A 1950 survey of practicing engineers found that there were many more than the sum of those in 1940 plus those graduating from engineering colleges in the 1940-50 decade; much of this difference was attributed to persons who gained this classification through the ESMWT program.

Many schools considered graduation from ESMWT courses to have great significance. As an example, at [[North Carolina State University]] the Chancellor often personally awarded certificates to the graduates. 
 
The Office of Education requirements were that students of any race would be admitted to ESMDT courses. Unfortunately, African-Americans were not well represented either in the participating institutions or as students. [[Howard University]] did have a relatively large program for the District of Columbia area; this was led by Herman R. Branson of the Physics Department who had a distinguished post-war career in academia.

==Noteworthy offerings==

From June 23 to August 29, 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate=2010-12-04| title=Mauchly Papers at Penn Library | url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/mauchly/img/course.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; electrical engineering student [[J. Presper Eckert]] assisted in teaching a 10-week ESMDT course in electronics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]]. The course had 30 students, 16 of whom held Ph.D. degrees. Among the students was [[John W. Mauchly]]. Eckert and Mauchly then teamed in developing the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer ([[ENIAC]]), America's first large-scale digital computer.

Courses in industrial chemistry and metallurgy were in great demand. Harry J. Sweeney, then Chief Metallurgist for the giant [[Republic Steel]], stated, "I don’t know what we would have done without the ESMDT courses; about 75 percent of our new professionals were trained through this program."

Aircraft played a vital role in World War II. During 1940, [[Cornell University]] started courses in aircraft structures and stress analysis at [[Buffalo, New York]], for [[Bell Aircraft]] and [[Curtis Wright]]. One of these, starting December 9, was the first EDT-sponsored course in the U.S. By the end of the first year, more than 800 students were attending these classes.

In 1941, the [[University of Texas]] started a series of ESMDT courses in aeronautical engineering. These were so successful that the next year a full Department of Aeronautical Engineering was formed. For the aircraft industries of Los Angeles, Maurice J. Zucrow of [[University of California, Los Angeles]], taught ESMWT courses on [[jet propulsion]] and [[gas turbines]], introducing hundreds of aeronautical engineers to this critical technology of post-war propulsion.

Across the nation, some of the most attended courses were in electronics and radio communications. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard University]], [[Tufts College]], [[Northeastern University]], [[Boston University]], and [[Boston College]] joined forces to offer the ESMDT/ESMWT program; Dean Edward L. Moreland of MIT served as the coordinator. Much of it was in support of the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at MIT where microwave radar was being developed and the electronics firms in the northeast area.

[[Rutgers University]] was one of the few participants that included labor-management courses in its ESMWT offerings. These brought workers to the Rutgers campus in unprecedented numbers. The coordinator, Norman C. Miller stated, "The spirit of patriotism, sacrifice, and co-operation that imbued both labor and management in service to the war effort was clearly evident in these courses." This effort carried into the post-war era with the establishment of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Rutgers,

'''Entrainment''' in the [[biomusicological]] sense refers to the [[synchronization]] of organisms (only humans as a whole, with some particular instances of a particular animal) to an external perceived [[rhythm]], such as human [[music]] and [[dance]] such as '''foot tapping'''.

==Beat induction==
'''Beat induction''' is the process in which a regular [[isochronous]] pulse is activated while one listens to music (i.e. the beat to which one would tap one's foot). It was thought that the [[cognitive]] mechanism that allows us to infer a beat from a sound pattern, and to [[synchronize]] or [[dance]] to it, was uniquely human.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} No primate tested so far—with exception of the human species—can dance or collaboratively clap to the beat of the music. Humans know when to start, when to stop, when to speed up or to slow down, in synchronizing with their fellow dancers or musicians.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Although primates do not appear to display beat induction, some parrots do. The most famous example, [[Snowball (cockatoo)|Snowball]] was shown to display genuine dance, including changing his movements to a change in tempo (Patel et al., 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patel | first1 = A.D. | last2 = Iversen | first2 = J.R. | last3 = Bregman | first3 = M.R. | last4 = Schulz | first4 = I. | year = 2009 | title = Experimental evidence for synchronization to a musical beat in nonhuman animals | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 827–830 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.038 | pmid=19409790}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Beat induction can be seen as a fundamental [[cognitive skill]] that allows for music (e.g., Patel, 2008; Honing, 2007; 2012). We can hear a pulse in a rhythmic pattern while it might not even be explicitly in there: The pulse is being induced (hence the name) while listening—like a perspective can be induced by looking at an arrangement of objects in a picture.

Neuroscientist Ani Patel proposes beat induction—referring to it as "beat-based rhythm processing"—as a key area in music-language research, suggesting beat induction "a fundamental aspect of music cognition that is not a byproduct of cognitive mechanisms that also serve other, more clearly adaptive, domains (e.g. auditory scene analysis or language)" (Patel, 2008).

==Evolutionary function==
[[Joseph Jordania]] recently suggested that the human ability to be entrained was developed by the forces of [[natural selection]] as an important part of achieving the specific [[altered state of consciousness]], battle trance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jordania]]. [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]. Logos, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving this state, in which humans lose their individuality, do not feel fear and pain, are united in a shared [[collective identity]], and act in the best interests of the group, was crucial for the physical survival of our ancestors against the big African predators, after [[hominids]] descended from the safer trees to the dangerous ground and became [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]].

The '''experience machine''' or '''pleasure machine''' is a thought experiment put forward by  philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] in his 1974 book  ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nozick | first = Robert | title = Anarchy, state, and utopia | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1974 | isbn = 0-465-09720-0 | pages = 42–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the best known attempts to refute ethical [[hedonism]], and does so by imagining a choice between everyday reality and an apparently preferable [[simulated reality]].

If the primary thesis of hedonism is that "pleasure is the good", then any component of life that is not pleasurable does nothing directly to increase one's [[well-being]]. This is a view held by many value theorists, but most famously by some classical [[Utilitarianism|utilitarians]]. Nozick attacks the thesis by means of a [[thought experiment]]. If he can show that there is something other than pleasure that has value and thereby increases our well-being, then hedonism is defeated.

==The thought experiment==
Nozick asks us to imagine a machine that could give us whatever desirable or pleasurable experiences we could want. Psychologists have figured out a way to stimulate a person's brain to induce pleasurable experiences that the subject could not distinguish from those he would have apart from the machine. He then asks, if given the choice, would we prefer the machine to real life?

Nozick also believes that if pleasure were the only intrinsic value, people would have an overriding reason to be hooked up to an "experience machine," which would produce favorable sensations.

===Initial concerns===
Who would run the machines if everyone plugs in? Nozick asks us to ignore this concern, since it does not adversely affect the thought experiment. One could simply stipulate that the machines have been so well designed as to be fail-proof.

The experiment is also open to multiple interpretations. For instance, Nozick claims that you could either map out the rest of your life in the machine before plugging in, or you could unplug periodically to choose your programming for the next cycle. While interesting, these variations do not directly affect the argument.

===The argument===
The argument is along these lines:

*P1: If experiencing as much pleasure as we can is all that matters to us, then if we will experience more pleasure by doing x than by doing y, we have no reason not to do x rather than y.
*P2: We will experience more pleasure if we plug into the experience machine than if we do not plug into the experience machine.
*C1: If all that matters to us is that we experience as much pleasure as we can then we have no reason not to plug into the experience machine. (P1&amp;P2)
*P3: We have reason not to plug into the experience machine.
*C2: Experiencing as much pleasure as we can is not all that matters to us. (C1&amp;P3, by [[Modus tollens|MT]])

===Reasons not to plug in===
Nozick provides us with three reasons not to plug into the machine.

# ''We want to'' do ''certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them.''
#* "It is only because we first want to do the actions that we want the experiences of doing them." (Nozick, 43)
# ''We want to'' be ''a certain sort of person.''
#* "Someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate blob." (Nozick, 43)
# ''Plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality (it limits us to what we can make).''
#* "There is no ''actual'' contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated." (Nozick, 43)

===Counterarguments===
Psychologist Felipe de Brigard says that our intuitions about the experience machine may be affected by [[status quo bias]], and suggests reformulating the thought experiment in a form which counters this.&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek|author2=[[Peter Singer]]|title=The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2NeAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|date=22 May 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102242-5|pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his version:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
you wake up in a plain white room. You are seated in a reclining chair with a steel contraption on your head. A woman in a white coat is standing over you. 'The year is 2659,' she explains, 'The life with which you are familiar is an experience machine program selected by you some forty years ago. We at IEM interrupt our client's programs at ten-year intervals to ensure client satisfaction. Our records indicate that at your three previous interruptions you deemed your program satisfactory and chose to continue. As before, if you choose to continue with your program you will return to your life as you know it with no recollection of this interruption. Your friends, loved ones, and projects will all be there. Of course, you may choose to terminate your program at this point if you are unsatisfied for any reason. Do you intend to continue with your program?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If we feel differently about this version of the story compared to the form that Nozick offers, according to de Brigard this is due to [[status quo bias]].&lt;ref name="Lazari-RadekSinger2014"/&gt;

==In fiction==
{{See also|Simulated reality in fiction}}
Before it became a philosophical thought experiment in the mid seventies, the pleasurable but simulated experience versus reality dilemma had been a staple of science fiction; for example in the short story "[[The Chamber of Life]]" by [[Green Peyton Wertenbaker]] ([[:fr:Green Peyton Wertenbaker|fr]]) , published in the magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in October 1929. The novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' by [[David Foster Wallace]] involves a similar formulation of the experience machine. The novel revolves around a film titled ''Infinite Jest'' that is lethally pleasurable: the film is so entertaining that, once watched, the viewer will desire nothing else but to watch the film over and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sloane |first=Peter |year=2014 |title=The Divided Selves of David Foster Wallace |journal=Tropos |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=67-73 |doi=10.14324/111.2057-2212.011 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420208/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of movies centering on machines capable of replaying experiences previously recorded include the 1983 film ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'' and the 1995 film ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]''.&lt;ref name="Baggott2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jim Baggott]]|title=A Beginner's Guide to Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9yAa7kRYiUkC&amp;pg=PT137|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-104232-9|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also is a running theme of the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]''.&lt;ref name="Grau2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Grau|title=Philosophers Explore The Matrix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Pmld5FXZ0YC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518107-4|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agent Smith]]'s account of the early history of the Matrix includes the idea that humans reject a virtual reality that offers them paradise; however, later his informant  [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Mr. Reagan.2FCypher|Cypher]] is willing to betray his colleagues because he would prefer to be reinserted into an (arguably less perfect) Matrix as a wealthy and successful man than continue to live in the harsh realities outside the simulation. While this later version of the Matrix is not a paradise-like reality in the literal sense, it may be argued that it is a lot like a pleasure-inducing Experience Machine, since Cypher is given the opportunity to have a prominent position of power and wealth in this new simulation. As he says while dining at a simulated restaurant: &lt;blockquote&gt;"You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy, and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9954">'''Frame analysis''' (also called '''framing analysis''') is a [[multi-disciplinary]] [[social science]] research method used to analyze how people understand situations and activities. The concept is generally attributed to the work of [[Erving Goffman]] and his 1974 book ''Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience'' and has been developed in [[social movement]] theory, [[policy studies]] and elsewhere.

Framing theory and frame analysis is a broad theoretical approach that has been used in [[communication studies]], news (Johnson-Cartee, 1995), politics, and social movements among other applications. "Framing is the process by which a communication source, such as a news organization, defines and constructs a political issue or public controversy" (Nelson, Oxley, &amp; Clawson, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;221).

==As rhetorical criticism==
Frame analysis had been proposed as a type of rhetorical analysis for political actors in the 1980s.  Political communication researcher [[Jim A. Kuypers]] first published his work advancing framing analysis as a rhetorical perspective in 1997. His approach begins inductively by looking for themes that persist across time in a text (for Kuypers, primarily news narratives on an issue or event), and then determining how those themes are framed. Kuypers' work begins with the assumption that frames are powerful rhetorical entities that "induce us to filter our perceptions of the world in particular ways, essentially making some aspects of our multi-dimensional reality more noticeable than other aspects. They operate by making some information more salient than other information. ..."&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, '' Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action '', Lexington Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In "Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective" Kuypers details the differences between framing analysis as rhetorical criticism and as a social scientific endeavor, in particular arguing that framing criticism offers insights unavailable to social scientists.&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, "Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective", P. D'Angelo and J. A. Kuypers, eds., ''Doing News Framing Analysis,'' Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 work, ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;ref&gt;
''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers offers a detailed template for doing framing analysis from a rhetorical perspective. According to Kuypers, "Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner. Frames operate in four key ways: they define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies. Frames are often found within a narrative account of an issue or event, and are generally the central organizing idea."&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers, ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age'' , Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers' work is based on the premise that framing is a rhetorical process and as such it is best examined from a rhetorical point of view.

==For social movements==
Framing has been utilized to explain the process of social movements (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A. and Robert D. Benford (1988). "Ideology, Frame Resonance, and Participant Mobilization". Pp. 197-217 in Bert Klandermans, Hanspeter Kriesi, and Sidney Tarrow (eds.), From Structure to Action: Social Movement Participation Across Cultures. Greenwich, Conn.: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Movements are carriers of beliefs and ideologies. In addition, they are part of the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988). Mass movements are said to be successful when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties. This is a process known as ''frame alignment''.

==Frame alignment—a process to explain social movement theory==
Snow and Benford (1988) say that frame alignment is an important element in social mobilization or movement. They argue that when individual frames become linked in congruency and complementariness, that "frame alignment" occurs (p.&amp;nbsp;198; Snow et al. 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;464&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A., R. Burke Rochford, Jr., Steven K. Worden, and Robert D. Benford. 1986. "Frame Alignment Processes, Micromobilization, and Movement Participation." American Sociological Review 51: 464-481.&lt;/ref&gt;), producing "frame resonance", which is key to the process of a group transitioning from one frame to another (although not all framing efforts are successful). The conditions that affect or constrain framing efforts are:
* "The robustness, completeness, and thoroughness of the framing effort". Snow and Benford (1988) identify three core framing tasks and the degree to which these tasks are attended to will determine participant mobilization. The three tasks are: 
:# diagnostic framing for the identification of a problem and assignment of blame;
:# prognostic framing to suggest solutions, strategies, and tactics to a problem; and
:# motivational framing that serves as a call to arms or rationale for action.
* The relationship between the proposed frame and the larger belief system; centrality – the frame cannot be of low hierarchical significance and salience within the larger belief system. Its range and interrelatedness – if the frame is linked to only one core belief or value that, in itself, is of limited range within the larger belief system, the frame has a high degree of being discounted.
* Relevance of the frame to the realities of the participants; a frame must be relevant to participants and inform them. Relevancy can be constrained by empirical credibility or testability, it relates to participant experience, and has narrative fidelity, that is, it fits in with existing cultural myths and narrations.
* Cycles of protest (Tarrow 1983a; 1983b); the point at which the frame emerges on the timeline of the current era and existing preoccupations with social change. Framing efforts may be affected by previous frames.

Snow and Benford (1988) propose that once proper frames are constructed as described above, large-scale changes in society such as those necessary for social movement can be achieved through frame alignment.

==For political thought==
Frame analysis for political thought has been dominated by two popular cognitive scientists: [[George Lakoff]], nurturant parent governance; and [[Frank Luntz]], strict father governance.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Watts, co-founder, Empathy Surplus Project, http://empathysurplus.com/?recruiter_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four types of frame alignment==
There are four types, which include frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension and frame transformation.

# '''Frame bridging''' is the "linkage of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames regarding a particular issue or problem" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;467). It involves the linkage of a movement to "unmobilized sentiment pools or public opinion preference clusters" (p.&amp;nbsp;467) of people who share similar views or grievances but who lack an organizational base.
#'''Frame amplification''' refers to "the clarification and invigoration of an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem, or set of events" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469). This interpretive frame usually involves the invigorating of values or beliefs.
# '''Frame extensions''' are a movement's effort to incorporate participants by extending the boundaries of the proposed frame to include or encompass the views, interests, or sentiments of targeted groups. (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469)
#'''Frame transformation''' is a process required when the proposed frames "may not resonate with, and on occasion may even appear antithetical to, conventional lifestyles or rituals and extant interpretive frames" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;473). When this happens, new values, new meanings and understandings are required in order to secure participants and support. Goffman (1974, p.&amp;nbsp;43–44) calls this "keying" where "activities, events, and biographies that are already meaningful from the standpoint of some primary framework transpose in terms of another framework" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;474) such that they are seen differently. There are two types of frame transformation:
## '''Domain-specific transformations''' such as the attempt to alter the status of groups of people, and
## '''Global interpretive frame transformation''' where the scope of change is quite radical as in a change of world views, total conversions of thought, or uprooting of all that is familiar (e.g. moving from [[communism]] to [[market capitalism]]; religious conversion, etc.).

The '''Friedrich Ebert Foundation''' (''[[German language|German]]: '''Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung'''; Abbreviation: '''FES''''') is a German political [[Foundation (charity)|foundation]] associated with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), yet independent of it. Established in 1925 as the political legacy of [[Friedrich Ebert]], Germany's first democratically elected President, it is the largest and oldest of the German party-associated foundations. It is headquartered in [[Bonn]] and [[Berlin]], and has offices and projects in over 100 countries. It is Germany's oldest organisation to promote democracy, political education, and promote students of outstanding intellectual abilities and personality.
==History==
The FES was named for [[Friedrich Ebert]] (1871–1925), the Social Democratic [[President of Germany]], 1919-1925. In his [[Will (law)|will]], he specified that the proceeds from donations at his funeral should be used to create a foundation.  The SPD chairman at the time, [[Konrad Ludwig]], was given the responsibility of building this foundation, which he did a few days after Ebert's death in 1925.
The main concern of the foundation was to work against discrimination of workers in the area of education:
"The Friedrich Ebert Foundation pursues the goal of giving young, empowered [[proletarians]] government aid to fund an education at state-accredited institutions.  As a basic principle, only those people who have a recommendation from the party organisation will receive funding." (SPD Yearbook 1926)
By the end of 1931, 295 students had been funded with over 52,000 [[Deutsche Mark|marks]].  Unfortunately, at this point the funding of the foundation fell through, as a result of the [[Great Depression]].
The FES was a section of the Social Democratic Education and Culture Organisation, and was banned along with the party itself in 1933 by the [[Nazi]]s.
In 1946, the FES was reinstituted at the founding assembly of the Socialist German Student Federation. In 1954, the FES was restructured into a charitable organisation "for the advancement of democratic education". This established the FES as an independent, self-contained institute.
In addition to education programmes, the FES has also worked in the area of [[development aid]] since the 1960s.  In this effort, it has supported democracy and freedom movements, for instance in the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), and played an important role in overcoming dictatorial regimes in [[Greece]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]].  Thus it was not a coincidence that the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party of Portugal]] was formed in an FES school in the German town of [[Bad Münstereifel]].

==Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Academic Foundation==
The '''Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Academic Foundation''' ('''FES''') is one of eleven organizations for the promotion of young talents (Begabtenförderwerke) in Germany. Only 1% of German students achieve a scholarship at one of the eleven organizations (i.e. FES, [[Studienstiftung]], [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stipendiumplus.de/&lt;/ref&gt; It is financially funded and subsidized by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and supports students with outstanding academical and political achievements. Awards are granted after a multi-stage selection process and are based on grades, letters of recommendation, letters of motivation, political and social engagement as well as personality and character. Until today it has sponsored more than 12,000 grantees. Over 90% of those sponsored graduate with honours.  In 2005, there were 1,731 students in the programme, of which 51% were women.  Beyond the financial support, grantees also receive so-called ideational support, which comes from opportunities to attend political seminars, conferences, and other activities, which can be important job qualifications.  The FES kept its own conference center on the Venusberg in [[Bonn]] for these activities until its closure in 2009.  Each year, the grantees vote for a board during the nationwide conference at the Stresemann Institute in Bonn.  This board serves for the next full year as the representation of grantees for dialog with the foundation.  The FES maintains a website ([http://www.fes-stip.de] www.fes-stip.de) for networking among grantees, which includes a wide variety of mailing lists, services, and communications tools.

Students are assigned advisors who work with them for the length of their grants, and also belong to a student organisation.

==Further activities==
[[File:Bonn FES.jpg|thumb|250px|Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Bonn]]
Today, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation's main goals are to promote political and societal education of people from all walks of life in the spirit of democracy and pluralism, to enable young people the opportunity to study and do research through grants, and to work toward international understanding and cooperation.

The foundation employs several hundred employees in their offices in [[Bonn]] and [[Berlin]], as well as in 14 regional offices and an academy within Germany and in over 100 foreign agencies.  It is financed mainly through grants from the federal budget and the budgets of the various [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]].

Since 1971, foreign students have also had the opportunity to receive grants through solidarity funds.  Preference for these grants goes to people who are persecuted on political, racial or religious grounds.  Funding for this program comes exclusively from donations from current and former grantees.  The program have helped over 1,000 students.  Currently there are 31 students who are in the solidarity programme. Two grantees from this programme are chosen every year at the conference in Bonn to work on the steering committee of the fund.

The historical research center of the foundation also contains the Archive of Social Democracy and its libraries in Bonn and at the [[Karl Marx House]] in [[Trier]].  This is one of the largest collections of documents on [[social history]] and the history of the [[Labour movement|workers movement]].

Since 1982, the foundation has awarded a prize of 10,000 euro called "The Political Book" to promote noteworthy political books. The prize serves to remind people of the [[Nazi book burnings]] of May 10, 1933.

A '''gravity-based structure''' (GBS) is a support structure held in place by [[gravity]]. A common application for a GBS is an offshore [[oil platform]]. These structures are often constructed in [[fjords]] since their protected area and sufficient depth are very desirable for construction. A GBS intended for use as an offshore oil platform is constructed of steel [[reinforced concrete]], often with tanks or cells which can be used to control the buoyancy of the finished GBS. When completed, a GBS is towed to its intended location and sunk. Prior to deployment, a [[Offshore geotechnical engineering|study of the seabed]] have to be done in order to ensure it can withstand the vertical load exerted on it by that structure.&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;Dean, E.T.R. (2010). Offshore Geotechnical Engineering - Principles and Practice. Thomas Telford, Reston, VA, U.S.A., 520 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity-based structures are also used for offshore [[wind power]] plants. By the end of 2010, 14 of the world's offshore wind farms were supported by gravity-based structures. The GBS are suited for water depths greater than 20 m. The deepest registered offshore wind farm with gravity-based structures is Thornton Bank 1, Belgium, with a depth up to 27.5 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lorc.dk/Knowledge/Offshore-renewables-map/Offshore-site-datasheet/Thornton-Bank-1-Offshore-Wind-Farm/000030|title=LORC Knowledge. "Datasheet for site: Thornton Bank 1 offshore wind farm", 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As offshore wind power plants are growing in size and moving towards deeper waters, the GBS is considered competitive in comparison with other support structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87309">The '''history of advertising''' can be traced to ancient civilizations. It became a major force in [[capitalist]] economies in the mid-19th century, based primarily on [[newspaper]]s and magazines. In the 20th century, [[advertising]] grew rapidly with new technologies such as [[direct mail]], [[radio]], [[television]], the internet and mobile devices.

[[File:Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestice Product in the United States.svg|thumb|Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestic Product in the United States, 1919 to 2007 per Douglas Galbi.]]

Between 1919 and 2007 advertising averaged 2.2 percent of [[Gross Domestic Product]] in the United States.

==Pre-modern history==

[[File:Bronze printing plate for an advertisement.jpg|thumb|Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at [[Jinan]], [[Song dynasty]] China. It is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.]]
Egyptians used [[papyrus]] to make sales messages and wall posters. [[Advertising campaign|Commercial messages]] and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and  [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. [[Lost and found]] advertising on papyrus was common in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian [[rock art]] paintings that date back to 4000 BC.&lt;ref name= Bhatia&gt;Bhatia (2000). ''Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism'', 62+68&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the [[Classic of Poetry]] (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell candy. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the [[Song dynasty]] used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with "[[Jinan]] Liu's Fine Needle Shop" and "We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time" written above and below.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China," ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' [European Conference Proceedings] Vol. 8, 2008; Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "A Brief History of Branding in China," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Liu, ''Chinese Business: Landscapes and Strategies'' (2013), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]

In Europe, as the towns and cities of the [[Middle Ages]] began to grow, and the general populace was unable to read, instead of signs that read "cobbler", "miller", "tailor", or "blacksmith" would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in ''Les Crieries de Paris'' ([[Street cries]] of Paris), a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve.&lt;ref&gt;Aimeé Boutin, "Sound Memory: Paris Street Cries in Balzac's Pere Goriot," ''French Forum,'' Volume 30, Number 2, Spring 2005, pp. 67–78, DOI:10.1353/frf.2005.0029&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three major forms of advertisement existed during the pre-printing period (before the 15th-century); those forms were trademarks (moon, stars etc.), town criers and [[signage|sign boards]]:

* '''Trademarks''': The practice of attaching seals or marks to products was widespread in antiquity. Around 4,000 years ago, producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wengrow, D., "Prehistories of Commodity Branding," ''Current Anthropology,''Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7-34&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest use of maker's marks, dating to about 1,300 BCE, have been found in India.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, M. and Mufti, S.U., ''The Hot History &amp; Cold Future of Brands'', ''Journal of Managerial Sciences'', vol. 1, no. 1, 2007, pp 75–87, http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; By the medieval period, [[hallmark]]s were applied to high value goods such as precious metals, and assayers were appointed by governments to administer the system and ensure product quality.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, E.C., ''Byzantine Silver Stamps'', [Dumbarton Oaks Studies] Vol. 7, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1961, pp 23–35&lt;/ref&gt; 

* '''Town criers''': In ancient towns and cities, where the majority of citizens were illiterate, town-criers were appointed to call out official announcements and general news. Before long, private individuals began to employ public criers to act as an auctioneer.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, itinerant [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] developed a system of [[street cries]] to promote their goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, V., "The Streets for the People: London's Street Markets 1850–1939, ''Urban History'', June, 2015, pp. 1–21,&lt;/ref&gt; These street cries provided an essential public service before the advent of mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Garrioch, D., "Sounds of the City: the soundscape of early modern European towns," ''Urban History,'' 2003, Vol. 30, no. 1, pp 5&amp;ndash;25, [http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0963926803001019 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Saracens Head pub sign.jpg|thumb|left|Saracens Head pub sign, Bath, England]]
*'''Sign-boards''':  The use of commercial signage has a very ancient history. Retail signage and promotional signs appear to have developed independently in the East and the West. In antiquity, the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks were known to use signage for shop fronts as well as to announce public events such as market days.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, F.K.,  "The Ancient History of Advertising: Insights and Implications for Practitioners: What Today's Advertisers and Marketers Can Learn from Their Predecessors," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 57 no. 3, pp 239-244 DOI: 10.2501/JAR-2017-033&lt;/ref&gt; China also exhibited a rich history of early retail signage systems.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419–32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Medieval Britain and France and much of Europe, innkeepers were compelled to erect a sign-board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manton|first=Dafydd|title=Ale and Arty in Sheffield: The Disappearing Art of Pub Signs|year=2008|publisher=Arc Publishing and Print|location=Sheffield, England|isbn=978-1906722005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth.

==16th-18th centuries==

Modern advertising began to take shape with the advent of newspapers and magazines in the 16th and 17th centuries. The very first weekly [[gazette]]s appeared in Venice in the early 16th-century. From there, the concept of a weekly publication spread to Italy, Germany and Holland.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, J., "The 'Avvisi' of Venice: Toward an Archaeology of Media Forms." ''Journalism History'' 14#2, 1987, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the first weeklies appeared in the 1620s, and its first daily newspaper was the ''[[The Daily Courant]]'' published from 1702 to 1735.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B., ''From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History of English Newspapers to 1899'' (Ashgate, 2004; Hunt, M., "Hawkers, Bawlers, and Mercuries: Women and the London Press in the Early Enlightenment", ''Women &amp; History'', Vol. 3, no. 9, 1984 pp 41-68; Maxted, U., 'Mallet, Elizabeth (fl. 1672–1706)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66880, accessed 27 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from the outset, newspapers carried advertising to defray the cost of printing and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Barrès-Baker, M.C., ''An Introduction to the Early History of Newspaper Advertising'', [Brent Museum and Archive Occasional Publications, No. 2], Brent Heritage Services,   2006, &lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commercial advertisements were for books and quack medicines, but by the 1650s, the variety of products being advertised had increased markedly.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, E.E., ''The Shocking History of Advertising'', New York, Ballantine Books, 1980, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in printing allowed retailers and manufacturers to print [[Flyer (pamphlet)|handbills]] and [[trade card]]s. For example, Jonathon Holder, a London haberdasher in the 1670s, gave every customer a printed list of his stock with the prices affixed. At the time, Holder's innovation was seen as a "dangerous practice" and an unnecessary expense for retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest trade cards were not cards at all, instead they were printed on paper and did not include illustrations. By the 18th century, however, they were printed on the more substantial card and typically bore the tradesmen's name and address, and before street numbering was in common use, often included a long-winded set of directions on how to locate the store or premises. With the advent of commercial engraving and lithography, illustrations became a standard feature of even the most humble trade card. Eventually trade cards evolved into business cards, which are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards," in ''The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian,'' Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, pp 334-335, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
In June 1836, [[Émile de Girardin]] editor of the Paris newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to rely on paid advertising to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability. His formula was soon copied by all titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clyde Thogmartin|title=The National Daily Press of France|year=1998|isbn=978-1-883479-20-6|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the [[printing press]]; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as modern people rejected traditional cures. However, [[false advertising]] and "[[Quackery]]" became common. British newspapers in the 1850s and 1860s appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.&lt;ref&gt;Beverley Ann Tudor, "Retail Trade Advertising in the 'Leicester Journal' and the 'Leicester Chronicle' 1855-71." ''European Journal of Marketing'' 20#9 (1986) pp: 41-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A leadership position in British advertising was held by [[Cope Bros &amp; Co]] tobacco company, founded in Liverpool in 1848 by Thomas and George Cope. Smoking, of course, had been common for centuries, but the innovations consisted in brand names, heavy advertising, and market segmentation according to class. An innovative appeal was to health consciousness; the ads directed at the middle-class men promised that  "smoke not only checks disease but preserves the lungs."   A rugged heavy taste was pitched to working men, soldiers and sailors,  while "delicately fragrant" was part of the appeal to the upper-class. The packaging was attractive, posters were omnipresent to show that smoking was a normal part of English life;  lobbying was used to undercut the anti-tobacco lobby.&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Seaton,"Cope's and the Promotion of Tobacco in Victorian England." ''European Journal of Marketing''  (1986) 20#9 pp: 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great Britain====
{{main article|History of advertising in Britain}}
[[Image:Parrywatercolour.jpg|right|thumb|390px|In Britain, outdoor advertising was based on hoardngs (billboards): England 1835, by [[John Orlando Parry]]]]
In London [[Thomas J. Barratt]] was hailed as "the father of modern advertising".&lt;ref&gt;He was first described as such in T F G Coates, 'Mr Thomas J Barratt, "The father of modern advertising"', Modern Business, September 1908, pp. 107–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "mat"&gt;Matt Haig, ''Brand failures: the truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time'', Kogan Page Publishers, 2005, pp. 219, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nick"&gt;Nicholas Mirzoeff, ''The visual culture reader'', Routledge, 2002, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; Working for the [[Pears Soap]] company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, "Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/04/27/100310554.pdf |title=Obituary, Thomas J. Barratt Dead: Chairman of the Firm of A. &amp; F. Pears an Advertising Genius|work=New York Times| page= 11 |publisher=New York Times |date=1914-04-27 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "part"&gt;Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, ''A Dictionary of Catch Phrases: British and American, from the Sixteenth Century to the Present Day'', Routledge, 1986, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

An advertising tactic that he used was to associate the Pears brand with high culture and quality. Most famously, he used the painting ''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]] as an advertisement by adding a bar of Pears soap into the foreground. Barratt continued this theme with a series of adverts of well groomed middle-class children, associating Pears with domestic comfort and aspirations of high society.

[[File:Pears Soap 1900.jpg|right|thumb|A 1900 British ad for soap]]

Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste."&lt;ref name = "mat"/&gt;

====United States====
In the United States around 1840, Volney B. Palmer set up the first [[advertising agency]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad – the copy, layout, and artwork – was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of [[N.W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was founded in New York. It planned, created, and executed complete advertising campaigns for its customers. It created a number of memorable slogans for firms such as [[De Beers]], [[AT&amp;T]] and the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency: N. W. Ayer &amp; Son 1869-1949'' (1949) p 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J. Walter Thompson Advertisement 1903.JPG|thumb|left|275px|J. Walter Thompson Co. promotes high-powered advertisement, 1903]]

By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.
&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Graphic Design: A New History |last=Eskilson |first=Stephen J. |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers.  [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was the first full-service agency to assume responsibility for advertising content. N.W. Ayer opened in 1869, and was located in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"/&gt;

The amount of space available in newspapers grew rapidly. The ''Boston Transcript'' published in 19,000 "agate lines" Of advertising in 1860,  87,000 in 1900, and 237,000 in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Starch, ''Advertising Principles'' (1927)  p 485&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, 104 companies spent over $50,000 each on national advertising; most sold patent medicines, which faded away after the federal food and drug legislation of the early 20th century. Seven innovators had emerged in the big time: [[Quaker Oats]], Armour meat, Cudahy meat, American Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard tobacco, Remington Typewriters, and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] soap.  By 1914, two thirds of the top advertisers came from just five industries: 14 food producers, 13 in automobiles and tires,  nine in soap and cosmetics, and four in tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Pope, ''The making of modern advertising'' (1983) pp 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agencies were forever breaking up and reforming, especially when one executive would split taking with him a major client and his team of [[copywriter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency '' (1949) pp 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In the late 19th century in France, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] extended the services of his news agency, [[Havas]] to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

== Since 1900:  Global==
Advertising in the developing world was dominated by agencies in the imperial powers, especially from London and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Ciochetto, ''Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China'' (2013) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  [[J. Walter Thompson]] became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.  It expanded across the globe, becoming one of the first American agencies in Egypt, South Africa and Asia.  Much of the pressure to expand came from General Motors, which wanted to export its automobiles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring,  "The Globalization of American Advertising and Brand Management: A Brief History of the J. Walter Thompson Company, Proctor and Gamble, and US Foreign Policy." ''Global Studies Journal'' (2013). 5#4&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford turned to N.W. Ayer, which began its expansion in Europe and Latin America in the 1930s.  The typical policy was to put an American manager in charge, and hire a staff drawn from locals who had a better understanding of the language and the culture.  In 1941-42, however, Ayer closed its foreign offices and decided to concentrate on the American market.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, 'The History of an advertising agency: N.W. Ayer &amp; Son at work, 1869-1949." (1949) pp 140-46, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, spending on advertising reached $143 billion in the United States and $467 billion worldwide.&lt;ref name="WPP Group Forecasts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/2011/dec/05/groupm-forecasts-global-ad-spending-to/ |title=GroupM forecasts 2012 global ad spending to increase 6.4% |publisher=WPP |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, internationally, the largest ("big four") advertising conglomerates are [[Interpublic]], [[Omnicom]], [[Publicis]], and [[WPP Group|WPP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parekh |first=Rupal |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/big-holding-firms-adland-anymore-big/236001/ |title=Not the 'Big Four' Holding Firms in Adland Anymore – Now It's the Big Five &amp;#124; Agency News – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=July 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1900: United States and Canada==
[[File:Ad Encyclopaedia-Britannica 05-1913.jpg|thumb|right|An American magazine ad for the 1913 issue of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Although this encyclopedia was edited and printed in the United States, it featured the British name and spelling to gain prestige]]

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States after 1870 as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products to a very large market. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 33. "As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single-purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods."&lt;/ref&gt; Total advertising volume in the United States grew from about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Pope|title=The making of modern advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bElPAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s and 1920s, many ad men believed that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed – "[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]]" into the desire to purchase commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness: Advertising and the Social Roots of the Consumer Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2008|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Bernays]], a nephew of [[Sigmund Freud]], promoted the approach making him [[Tobacco advertising|a pioneer of modern cigarette advertising.]]  Glantz argues, "it was really the tobacco industry, from the beginning, that was at the forefront of the development of modern, innovative, advertising techniques."&lt;ref name="GlantzModernAds"&gt;Stanton Glantz in ''[[Mad Men]] Season 3 Extra – Clearing the Air – The History of Cigarette Advertising'', part 1, min 3:38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, under [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]], the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1929, the head of the U.S. [[Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce]], Julius Klein, stated "Advertising is the key to world prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the "unparalleled" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising was a vehicle for [[cultural assimilation]], encouraging immigrants to exchange their traditional habits and tastes in favor of a modern American lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2008|pages=56–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the [[American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers]] (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeanne D. Petit|title=The Men and Women We Want: Gender, Race, and the Progressive Era Literacy Test Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTubHqECr84C&amp;pg=PA66|year=2010|publisher=U of Rochester Press|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian media market===
In 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as  contracts for public printing  controlled by the political parties. With the rise of national advertising agencies after 1900, a major transformation was underway. The advertisers wanted them to reach the maximum possible circulation, regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Across the board, the news pages increasingly featured more objectivity and bipartisanship, and the publishers were mostly focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911.  Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations]], which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were "independent" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Johnston, "Partisan Politics, Market Research, and Media Buying in Canada, 1920," '' Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly'' (2006) 83#4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and psychology===
{{main article|Sex in advertising}}
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|300px|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal'' version of the famous ad]]

At the turn of the 20th century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their household, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]]  at J. Walter Thompson Agency, was one of the pioneers.

In 1911, the [[Woodbury Soap Company]] became the first to use images of sexual contact to sell a product. Their ad slogan, created by Helen Lansdowne, claimed that women who used the soap would have "Skin You Love To Touch". Her copy promised the soap would increase the beauty of one's skin; it offered a color print and a week's supply of the soap for 10 cents. The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history. It was ranked 31st on ''Advertising Age's'' list of the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/resor-helen-lansdowne-1886-1964/98850/ "Resor, Helen Lansdowne (1886-1964)" in ''Advertising Age'' Sept 15, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nudity===
In 1936, Woodbury was one of the first companies to use nudity in its advertisements. The ad, known as "The Sun Bath", was photographed by [[Edward Steichen]] and showed a nude woman lying on stairs on her side with her back to the camera. The text advertised that Woodbury Soap was now enriched with "filter sunshine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria |title=For Appearance' Sake: The Historical Encyclopedia of Good Looks, Beauty, and Grooming|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=1-573-56204-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many celebrities appeared in advertisements for Woodbury Soap.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in advertising in Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle R. Nelson and Hye-Jin Paek, "Nudity of female and male models in primetime TV advertising across seven countries," ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2008) 27#5 pp 715-744&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
In the early 20th century, psychologists Walter D. Scott and [[John B. Watson]] contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, "Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L.T., &amp; Baker, D.B. 2004. Industrial-organizational psychology: The new psychology and the business of advertising. ''From Séance to Science: A History of the Profession of Psychology in America''. 118-121. California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer. The former chair at [[Johns Hopkins University]], John B. Watson was a highly recognized psychologist in the 1920s. After leaving the field of academia he turned his attention towards advertising where he implemented the concepts of [[behaviorism]] into advertising. This focused on appealing to the basic emotions of the consumer: love, hate, and fear. This type of advertising proved to be extremely effective as it suited the changing social context which led to heavy influence of future advertising strategy and cemented the place of psychology in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jackson Lears,  "From salvation to self-realization: Advertising and the therapeutic roots of the consumer culture, 1880-1930."

''Journal of Advertising'' 19#2 (1990): 49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Lasker:  Salesmanship in print===
{{main article|Albert Lasker}}
Chicago, along with New York, was the center of the nation's advertising industry. Albert Lasker, known as the "father of modern advertising," made Chicago his base 1898–1942. As head of the [[Draftfcb|Lord and Thomas agency]], Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked [[Lucky Strikes]] they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for [[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]] soap, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste, [[Kotex]] products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur W. Schultz, "Albert Lasker's Advertising Revolution," ''Chicago History,'' Nov 2002, Vol. 31#2 pp. 36–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked. Lasker believed that advertising consisted of news and information was news, He changed his mind when a colleague Johnny Kennedy told him, "News is a technique of presentation, but advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words, it is 'salesmanship in print'".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshank &amp; Arthur W. Schultz, ''The Man Who Sold America,'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;  Lasker and Kennedy used this concept with [[Whirlpool Corporation|the 1900 Washer Co.]] (later Whirlpool). Their campaign was so successful that, within four months of running the first ad, they attracted additional clients and their "advertising spend" went from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a month. Within six months, their firm was one of the three or four largest advertisers in the nation.

In 1908 Lasker recruited [[Claude C. Hopkins]] to the firm, specifically to work on the Van Camp Packaging Company ([[Van Camp's]]) account. The relationship lasted for 17 years. Lasker helped create America's infatuation with orange juice. Lord &amp; Thomas acquired the [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated]] account in 1908, when the citrus industry was in a slump. Lasker created campaigns that not only encouraged consumers to eat oranges, but also to drink orange juice.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunther, ''Taken at the Flood'' (1960) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Lasker's pioneering contributions was the introduction into public schools of classes that explained to young girls about puberty and [[menstruation]] (done to promote [[Kotex]] [[tampons]]). He is also credited as the creator of the [[soap opera]] genre, and using radio and television as media driven by advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinrich|first1=Thomas|last2=Batchelor|first2=Bob|title=Kotex, Kleenex, Huggies: Kimberly-Clark and the Consumer Revolution in American Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlPNB5HpRDIC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2004|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruikshank|first1=Jeffrey L.|last2=Schultz|first2=Arthur|title=The Man Who Sold America: The Amazing (but True!)

Morello, ''Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the radio from the 1920s===
{{main article|History of broadcasting}}
[[File:1930.05.06 Advertisement for Radio Broadcast With Lisa Roma.gif|thumb|Advertisement for a live radio broadcast, sponsored by a milk company and published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on May 6, 1930]]

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. Madison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. United States, never had a licensing fee for set users.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Smulyan]], ''Selling radio: The commercialization of American broadcasting, 1920-1934'' (Smithsonian Inst Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain Use the mandatory fee on set owners to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], Which to this day operates without commercials or advertising.  However, the government permitted
commercial television in 1954 and commercial radio in 1972.

[[Public service advertising]], [[non-commercial advertising]], public interest advertising, [[cause marketing]], and [[social marketing]] are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.

In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of [[public service ad]]vertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required public service announcements during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Public service advertising in the United States reached its height during the world wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Creel]], ''How we advertised America: The first telling of the amazing story of the Committee on Public Information that carried the gospel of Americanism to every corner of the globe'' (1920).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Hollihan, "Propagandizing in the interest of war: A rhetorical study of the committee on public information." ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 49#3 (1984): 241-257.&lt;/ref&gt; During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the [[Ad Council]]) which is the United States' largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running public service campaign, [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;Dannagal Goldthwaite Young, "Sacrifice, consumption, and the [[American way]] of life: Advertising and domestic propaganda during World War II." ''The Communication Review'' 8#1 (2005) pp: 27-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Griffith, "The Selling of America: The Advertising Council and American Politics, 1942–1960." ''Business History Review'' 57#3 (1983): 388-412 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3114050 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s and World War II===
Advertising came under heavy pressure in the 1930s. The [[Great Depression]] forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The [[New Deal]] furthermore aggressively promoted [[consumerism]], and minimized the value or need of advertising.  Historian Jackson Lears argues that "By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics." They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own [[market research]], as well has the key to understanding politics. [[George Gallup]], the vice president of [[Young and Rubicam]], and numerous other advertising experts, led the way.  Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the "American Way of Life" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. "Advertisers," Lears concludes, "played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson Lears|title=Fables Of Abundance: A Cultural History Of Advertising In America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgoXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean M. Converse," ''Survey Research in the United States: Roots and Emergence 1960'' (1987) pp: 114-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar era===
In the prosperous postwar era, millions of Americans moved into new housing, especially in the rapidly growing suburbs. They spent heavily on housing, appliances, furniture, clothing and automobiles. The coming of television in the 1950s dramatically enlarged the arena for advertising. With most families having automobiles, and more leisure time, travel holidays became much more common, and the motel and [[tourism]] industries eagerly supported large-scale advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Popp, ''The Holiday Makers: Magazines, Advertising and Mass Tourism in Postwar America'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public service arena, the Ad Council aggressively promoted [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] as a [[Cold War]] strategy, with campaigns such as the Freedom Train, the Crusade for Freedom, Religion in American Life, Adams for Piece, and Peoples Capitalism.  The new Brand Names Foundation sponsored conferences, local campaigns, and educational programs to promote brand loyalty, as well as free enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring, ''Advertising in the Age of Persuasion: Building Brand America, 1941-1961'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Hidden Persuaders'' (1957) popular writer [[Vance Packard]] exposes the use of consumer [[motivational research]] and other psychological techniques, including depth psychology and [[subliminal message|subliminal]] tactics. They had been used to manipulate expectations and induce desire for products since the 1920s, but the popular audience was caught by surprise. He identified eight "compelling needs" that advertisers promise products will fulfill. According to Packard these needs are so strong that people are compelled to buy products to satisfy them. The book questions the [[morality]] of using these techniques.&lt;ref name=DiRenzo&gt;Gordon Di Renzo (1958) ''The American Catholic Sociological Review'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (Dec., 1958) (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial themes====
Before the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, black people were largely missing from mainstream white advertising. Those who did appear typically followed the long-standing "hierarchy of skin color" whereby those with lighter skin tones were seen as being more socially and culturally acceptable than dark-skinned black people.&lt;ref&gt;Julia M. Bristor, Renee Gravois Lee, and Michelle R. Hunt. "Race and ideology: African-American images in television advertising." ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'' (1995): 48-59. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30000378 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jannette Lake Dates and William Barlow, eds., ''Split image: African Americans in the mass media'' (Howard University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most national corporations before the 1960s ignored the black market, and paid little attention to working with black merchants or hiring blacks for responsible positions. [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]] was a major exception, as the number two brand fought for parity with [[Coca-Cola]].  The upstart soda brand hired black promoters who penetrated into black markets across the South and the urban North. Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s: 
:The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, "ladies groups," schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to give shout-outs for Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, "How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity." ''CHANGE'' 63 (2007): 1-26 [http://www.comlabgames.com/45-870N/instructor/01_day/How_Pepsi_Opened_Door_to_Diversity.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:New-York tribune., November 07, 1909, Page 20, Image 44 Aunt Jemima.jpg|right|thumb|Quaker Oats 1909 newspaper ad directed at white consumers with stereotypical images and dolls.]]

Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted  one-dimensional [[Aunt Jemima]]s and [[Uncle Ben's|Uncle Bens]] whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead it portrayed black customers as self-confident [[middle-class]] citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, ''The Real Pepsi Challenge: The Inspirational Story of Breaking the Color Barrier in American Business'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, more than a few token blacks were hired at advertising agencies, and the sensitivity to the problem increased.  The leading black  magazines [[Essence (magazine)|''Essence'']] and [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'']] routinely deplored racism in mainstream media, especially in the negative depictions of black men and women. However ''Essence'' and ''Jet'' in the 21st century themselves ran about a dozen ads a year, especially for skin lighteners, that were pervaded with "racism and White supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Hazell and Juanne Clarke, "Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines" ''Journal of Black Studies'' (2008) 39#1 pp 5-21. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40282545 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco====
By the 1950s, fears of [[cancer]] from tobacco [[smoking]] caused consternation in the [[tobacco industry]], which turned to advertisers for help in avoiding falling consumer [[demand]] and increased regulation. British and American agencies separately arrived at similar solutions.  The Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the United States and the Tobacco Manufacturers' Standing Committee in Britain each assuaged public anxieties and encouraged the misperception that the cigarette makers were resolving the issues through filters and low tar formulations. The public relations approach was successful in the short run, but the accumulation of medical evidence led to a fall in smoking, heavier taxation, and increased regulation. The agencies responded with sophisticated advertising strategies designed to encourage adolescent smokers as well as to recruit new smokers in [[developing countries|less-developed foreign markets]].&lt;ref&gt;David T. Courtwright,  "'Carry on Smoking': Public Relations and Advertising Strategies of American and British Tobacco Companies since 1950," ''Business History'' (2005) 47#3 pp 421-432. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076790500056044?journalCode=fbsh20 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cable television from the 1980s===
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly [[MTV]]. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in ''for'' the advertising message, rather than it being a [[by-product]] or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, [[specialty channel]]s emerged, including channels entirely [[Shopping channel|devoted to advertising]], such as [[QVC]], [[Home Shopping Network]], and [[ShopTV Canada]].

===On the Internet from the 1990s===
{{main article|Online advertising}}
With the advent of the [[ad server]], marketing through the Internet opened new frontiers for advertisers and contributed to the "[[dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from [[coupon]]s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, a number of websites, including the [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Google]], started a change in [[online advertising]] by emphasizing contextually relevant ads based on an individual's browsing interests. This has led to a plethora of similar efforts and an increasing trend of [[interactive advertising]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on [[Tram|streetcars]], and outdoor [[poster]]s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower – about 2.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm |title=Annual U.S. Advertising Expenditure Since 1919 |publisher=Galbithink.org |date=September 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090401205848/http://galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm| archivedate= April 1, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising business model has also been adapted since the 1990s.  In [[media for equity]], advertising is not sold, but provided to start-up companies in return for [[equity (finance)|equity]]. If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares.

Chinese advertising is moving heavily to the smartphone, leaving television behind. Companies in China are increasingly more focused on mobile advertisements than on television advertisements. Central roles are played by Chinese-based social networking sites Weixin (also known as WeChat), and Sina Weibo, and the efforts of Western companies, including Coca-Cola, Burberry, and North Face, to market to Chinese consumers through their smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Stevenson and Shanshan Wang. "A Jump to Mobile Ads in China." ''New York Times'', 22 Dec 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restrictions on advertising====
Since the 1950s, the industry itself, or the government, has imposed some restrictions on advertising certain types of products, especially liquor and cigarettes. Tobacco bans exist in many major countries across the world and cover 2.3 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, ''WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2013: enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship'' (World Health Organization, 2013) [http://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2013/en/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s Quebec banned some advertising directed at children. The restrictions have hindered competition in the breakfast cereal market when compared with the rest of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;C. Robert Clark, "Advertising Restrictions and Competition in the Children's Breakfast Cereal Industry," ''Journal of Law &amp; Economics'' (2007) 50#4 pp 757-780. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/519820 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1900:  Europe==
[[File:Michelin Poster 1898.jpg|thumb|A poster by "[[Marius Rossillon|O'Galop]]" of [[Bibendum]], the Michelin Man, 1898]]
[[J. Walter Thompson]] became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Ciochetto, ''Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China'' (Routledge, 2013) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet]] (1906-1996) was the most prominent leader of French advertising in the 20th century. He founded [[Publicis]]. After 1945 his little-known Paris-based advertising agency grew rapidly, becoming the world's fourth largest agency. It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the advertising industry. It was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government, its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing industries.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Lorin, ''5 Giants of Advertising'' (Assouline Pub., 2001). pp 82-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark Hultquist, "Publicis and the French advertising world, 1946--1968" ''Essays in Economic &amp; Business History'' (2009) 27: 61-76&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether advertising reflects society or shapes society, can be seen in European models that diverged from the American style.  In France, [[Michelin]] dominated the tire industry and was one of the leading advertisers; to this day [[Michelin Guide|its famous guidebooks]] are very widely used by upscale travelers.  From 1894 to the present its symbol was [[Bibendum]] (the "Michelin Man" made of tires). He was a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic expounder of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America's superior factory system, but to patriotically avoid using the "inferior" products of those factories.  As automobiles diffused to the middle classes, Michelin advertising likewise shifted downscale, and its restaurant and hotel guides covered a broader range of price categories.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Harp, ''Marketing Michelin. Advertising and Cultural Identity in Twentieth-Century France'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Martin,  "Le marché publicitaire Français et les grands médias 1918-1970." ''Vingtieme siecle. Revue d'histoire'' (1988): 75-90. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/xxs_0294-1759_1988_num_20_1_2796 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

J Walter Thompson expanded successfully in many countries, but France was not one of them.  French businessmen did not like the American tone, and were fearful of Americanization. The French market was heavily regulated and protected to repel foreign interests, and the American admen in Paris were not good at hiding their condescension and insensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Eric Hultquist,  "Americans in Paris: The J. Walter Thompson Company in France, 1927–1968." ''Enterprise and Society'' 4#03 (2003): 471-501.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
As millions of American soldiers passed through  Britain during the Second World War, there were fearsof an "Americanization" of British commerce and culture. The Marshall Plan explicitly required and upgrading of the marketing and organizational skills of British industry. There were fears among the leaders of the  London advertising world of what the brash, rich Americans would do to them.    Radio and television was off limits to advertising, because BBC relied on fees paid by owners of radio receivers.  The question was whether the heavily funded American methods would prove irresistible. JWT London was an American owned  advertising agency controlled by J. Walter Thompson in New York City.   JWT London avoided being  the bold apostle of the American style. Instead  it is relied on soft persuasion, shedding its Americanness to adapt to the British understated style.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Nixon,  "Apostles of Americanization? J. Walter Thompson Company Ltd, Advertising and Anglo-American Relations 1945-67," ''Contemporary British History'' (2008) 22#4 pp 477-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the 1920s, most advertising was handled by manufacturing companies in-house. Numerous small advertising agencies handled purchase of space in the media, but did not design campaigns or the ads themselves. An important role was played by travelling salesmen in promoting products to wholesalers and retailers and providing feedback from the market to the producer.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela E. Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika: Advertising and Commercial Culture in Nazi Germany'' (2014) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nazi era (1933–45), the advertising industry expelled its Jews, and came under the supervision of the "Ad Council for the German Economy," a department of the propaganda ministry of [[Joseph Goebbels]]. The relationship was friendly, For the industry learned a great deal from the Nazi propaganda techniques. The industry promoted Hitler's favorite products, such as the promised Volkswagen automobile for the people, and the construction of autobahns. It emphasized the availability of trusted brands despite growing shortages after the war began in 1939. It helped support the regime, articulating a vision of consumption that was well aligned with the Nazi spirit. In some environments and social movements, such as with post-WW2 East Germany Stasi's [[zersetzung]], criminology theorists estimated advertisement was used as a means to crime, the nature of the crime was the intentional exploitation of an individual to cause damage to the individual's ability to form social bonds and appropriate perceptions of the world. This is especially true in the case of manipulation, people take advantage of their underdeveloped social skills and exploit them for selfish gain, this was later criticized to be adopted by turpitude agents of modern advertising. Many major brands were off the market by 1944, because of severe shortages. When they returned after the war, they were welcomed as an index of normality and were not associated with Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika'' (2014) ch 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, German advertising agencies were starting to mimic American methods.&lt;ref&gt;Harm G. Schröter, "Die Amerikanisierung der Werbung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland," ["The Americanization of advertising in West Germany."] ''Jahrbuch für Wirtschaftsgeschichte'' (1997), Issue 1, pp 93-115, dates the Americanization to the 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola was advising  "Mach mal Pause" ("Take a Rest!), and conservative Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was running for reelection with the slogan "Keine Experimente!" ("No Experiments!").&lt;ref&gt;Gries, Rainer et al. "Die Ära Adenauer: Zeitgeschichte im Werbeslogan. 'Mach Mal Pause,' 'Keine Experimente!'" ''Journal Geschichte'' (1989)  Issue 3, pp 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The German agencies have always remained small and limited in scope,&lt;ref&gt;"German agencies often overlooked on global scene."

===Italy===
The American influence became strong in Italy after 1945.  The high risk of communist success led the American government to invest heavily in propaganda activities.&lt;ref&gt;Simona Tobia. ''Advertising America: The United States Information Service in Italy (1945–1956)'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several American firms opened offices, including Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. Italian graphic designers, most prominently [[Armando Testa]], were inspired by modernist aesthetics and thinking brought in by the American advertising agencies and techniques in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Simona De Iulio,  and Carlo Vinti, "La publicité italienne et le modèle américain: le débat entre les artistes et techniciens, 1948-1960," [Italian advertising and the American model: the debate between artists and technicians, 1948-60] ''Vingtième Siecle'' (2009), Issue 101, pp 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertising industry helped transform Italy into a consumer-oriented society.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Arvidsson, "Pubblicita E Consumi Nell'Italia Del Dopoguerra" [Advertising and consumerism in postwar Italy] ''Contemporanea: Rivista di Storia dell '800 e del '900'' (2001) 4#4 pp 649-672.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Oliviero Toscani International Journalism Festival 3.jpg|thumb|200px|Oliviero Toscani]]

A dramatic example of how advertising nudged the Italian middle-class into modern consumer society appears in the heavily advertised automatic washing machine. It appeared on the Italian market in 1958 and by 1965, 23% of families had purchased one, reaching 42% by 1970. Advertisers hailed the  mechanization of domestic tedium as the advent of a new women's "liberation."  Commentary appeared everywhere, from advertisements to the specialized press, to women's reviews. Architects and designers made room for the new marvel, as the promotional language celebrating the device became a chorus of praise for domestic appliances as the secret of  "progress" and "freedom" and "liberation."  On the other hand, husbands still insisted on driving the family automobile; it was off-limits to the liberated female.&lt;ref&gt;Enrica Asquer, "La Signora Candy e la sua lavatrice: storia di un'intesa perfetta nell'Italia degli anni Sessanta." [Mrs. Candy and her washing machine: a perfect love story in 1960s Italy] ''Genesis'' 1 (2006) pp: 1000-1022.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Armando Testa Set up a full-service advertising agency in 1956, specializing in the new medium of television advertising.  He was inspired by Eastern European animation techniques, and often use simple graphics like the blue hippo. His son Marco Testa, trained at Benton &amp; Bowles in New York, and maintained the fast-paced, witty style.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 138-43&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuelle Pirella, who trained at the Italian offices of Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, emerged as a leading copywriter.

[[Benetton Group|Benetton]] gained worldwide attention for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director [[Oliviero Toscani]]. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign "United Colors of Benetton" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 146-49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Since 1900: Asia and Africa==

===Japan===
[[Dentsu]] is the dominant firm in Japan thanks to its origins as a media representative. It produced Japan's first newspaper advertisements as well as the first television commercials. It was established in 1901 as Japan Advertising Ltd. and Telegraphic Service Co. by Hoshiro Mitsunaga. In 1936, it sold off its news division to Doumei News Agency, to focus on advertising. In 1946, it purchased 16 small companies and set up operational bases in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kyūshū. Dentsu company now offers a range of services, from traditional and creative marketing to specialty disciplines such as sports marketing, investing in feature film production and acquiring broadcasting rights, PR, digital contents, and a growing range of communications services.&lt;ref&gt;Kotaro Sugiyama and Tim Andree. ''The Dentsu Way: Secrets of Cross Switch Marketing from the World's Most Innovative Advertising Agency'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In the first 20 years of communist control of China (1947 to 1966) Mao Zedong tried to reverse the long-standing advertising practices of Chinese newspapers, considering it a capitalist infringement on the goals of socialism. Consumerism, which had been highly developed in Shanghai, was anathema, to Mao's peasant-based communist perspective. The regime emphasized maximum production rather than optimal consumption. The approach worsened the massive famines that happened when national resources were devoted to a highly inefficient factory production at the cost of basic food output. On the other hand, propaganda was highly developed art in the Communist Party, and so a sort of  compromise was reached. Socialist-oriented advertising emphasized the collective good, rather than the benefits of products for the individual consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Gerth, "Compromising with Consumerism in Socialist China: Transnational Flows and Internal Tensions in 'Socialist Advertising'", ''Past &amp; Present'' (2013 Supplement)  pp 203-232  [http://karl-gerth.pubs-hub.ucsd.edu/mm_uploads/gerth-past-y-present-2013.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, the strength of the private economy, and advertising, has grown dramatically.  By the 1980s much emphasis was placed on the role of advertising in promoting [[Chinese economic reform|the Four Modernizations]] emphasized by [[Deng Xiaoping]].  Lip service is still paid to old Maoist ideals by recycling images of historic places and episodes, but it does not inhibit the growth of consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;Xin Zhao and Russell W. Belk, "Politicizing Consumer Culture: Advertising's Appropriation of Political Ideology in China's Social Transition," ''Journal of Consumer Research'' (2008) 35#2 pp 231-244&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, its advertising industry has fundamentally changed. It has become the world's fastest-growing advertising market and the country with the largest pool of netizens.  Major changes have come in terms of shifting cultural values, the growing role of brand names,  the attractiveness of English-language titles to the younger generation,  the redefinition of  acceptable/offensive advertising,  the very rapid growth of new media (especially the Internet and smart phones),  the emergence of on-line shopping in a country with an underdeveloped system of department stores in shopping centers, and much more advanced techniques of managing advertising agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Kineta Hung, et al.  "Advertising Research in the Post-WTO Decade in China," ''Journal of Advertising'' (2012) 41#3 pp 121-146&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Many elements of Indian culture and industry have British roots, so that British advertising models usually work well. In 1991, the government dramatically liberalized Indian economy, opening it to international business. The emergence of a moderately affluent middle-class numbering in the hundreds of millions attracts multinational corporations and international advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;William M. O'Barr, "Advertising in India." ''Advertising &amp; Society Review'' 9#.3 (2008) pp: 1-33. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/advertising_and_society_review/v009/9.3.o-barr.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aruna Chandra, David A. Griffith, and John K. Ryans, "Advertising standardisation in India: US multinational experience" ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2002) 21#1 pp47-66&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising in India operates at two levels. Ads for high-value products appear in English-language papers such as ''The Hindu'' and ''The Madras Mail,'' which targeted Europeans and high-status Indians. By contrast, ads for low-value products are typically placed in vernacular papers and are aimed at a lower middle class with highly restricted spending power. The working class and peasant populations, with very low disposable incomes, are seldom targeted by the advertising agencies. Local merchants might use signs and posters to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Haynes, "Advertising and the History of South Asia, 1880–1950" p 363&lt;/ref&gt;  Cricket is one sport where the Indians have had an international success, so that cricket stars are prominent endorsers in national advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Sharma, "Indian cricket players are becoming big winners for many advertisers," ''Asian Wall Street Journal'' (May 11, 1998) p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtle cultural norms can be easily transgressed. In 2002, widespread protests forced Hindustan Lever Ltd. (the Indian subsidiary of London-based Unilever) to cancel  a television ad campaign for its fairness cream because of its portrayal of women. The campaign was built around the theme of a father lamenting "If only I had a son" while showing his problem: a dark-skinned, unattractive daughter.  Fast-forward.  She uses the Fair &amp; Lovely cream and has become a gorgeous light-skinned beauty.  Clad in a stylish miniskirt, she is a successful airline flight attendant and takes her proud father to dine at a five-star hotel.  The All India Women's Democratic Association ([[AIDWA]]), a far left political organization, lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi. It argued endorsing the traditional preference for sons strengthens gender discrimination, which is a major problem in India. Furthermore, said AIDWA, the ad perpetuated a culture of discrimination in a society where "fair skin" is synonymous with "beautiful."  The government's Ministry of Information and Broadcast sided with AIDWA and directed stations not to air the ads because they violated the Cable and Television Networks Act of 1995 which states that no advertisement shall be permitted which "derides any race, caste, color, creed and nationality" and furthermore states that, "Women must not be portrayed in a manner that emphasizes passive, submissive qualities and encourages them to play a subordinate secondary role in the family and society."  The minister told Parliament that if broadcasters do not regulate ad content the government will be forced to do so. The Mumbai-based Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a body of advertisers and media agencies, insisted that it should do the regulating not the government. ASCI had already told Hindustan Lever that its ad campaign was offensive and it was ended.&lt;ref&gt;Arundhati Parmar, "Objections to Indian ad not taken lightly" ''Marketing News'' (June 9, 2003) 37#12 pp 4-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing world===
During the decolonization era from the late 1940s to the 1970s, British and French firms operating  in Africa and Asia at first largely ignored local, nationalistic aspirations.  However they learned to  adjust to exploit  the new spirit of independence that was shaping consumer attitudes.  The new emergence of a middle class was the target audience.  Their advertising abandoned the traditional  paternalistic attitude toward the natives. Instead there was a portrayal of locals as up-and-coming middle class men  in control of developing their nations. These more positive images assisted business operations  during spells of military dictatorship, economic nationalism, and expropriation of foreign assets.&lt;ref&gt;Sephanie Decker, "Corporate Legitimacy and Advertising: British Companies and the Rhetoric of Development in West Africa, 1950-1970," ''Business History Review'' (2007) 81#1 pp 59-86&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco advertising was especially important. For example, in Egyptian popular culture the cigar was associated with elites, the water pipe with a lower-class and traditional lifestyle, and the cigarette with the new middle class which was striving to make the transition to modernity.  It was the third group that the cigarette industry targeted.&lt;ref&gt;Relli Shechter, "Reading advertisements in a colonial/development context: Cigarette advertising and identity politics in Egypt, c1919-1939." ''Journal of social history'' 39#2 (2005): 483-503. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790779 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is the largest country in Latin America, and number five in the world in terms of population. Its economy grew rapidly in the 21st century, until it began to stall in 2010. At that time it was the world's sixth-biggest advertising market, at $US 14.2 billion.  Brazil in 2010 ranks #1 in deodorants, #2 in children's products, #3 in cosmetics, and #4 in automobile sales&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Wentz and Claudia Penteado, "Why so many agencies are storming road to Sao Paulo" ''Advertising Age'' (Dec. 6 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
The start in 1994 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] had a dramatic impact on the adveritising industry in Mexico, with its 130 full service agencies and 270 smaller operations under the auspisces of the Mexican Association of Advertising Agencies.  The flood of American brand-name products greatly expanded the scope of the advertising industry, and the Mexican agencies faced new competition from branch offices of international firms.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McCurry, "Advertising in transition: agencies change their image to meet market demand" ''Business Mexico'' (Sept. 1992) 2#4, Vol. 2, p4+&lt;/ref&gt;

A key to the new market was that upscale consumers in Mexico typically display [[Malinchism|"malinchismo"]], which is a preference for imported American brands rather than local Mexican brands. As a result, American products are sold mostly to the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts instead on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising battles in Mexico, include not only issues of quality, but issues of national authenticity. For example, in Mexico in the 1990s, two American exporters Procter &amp; Gamble and Frito-Lay fought an advertising battle concerning whose potato chips are tastier, more natural, and more Mexican. Procter &amp; Gamble challenged Frito-Lay's Sabritas which controls 80 percent of the $1 billion chip market.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Friedland, "P&amp;G, Frito-Lay in Mexican—ad standoff," ''Wall Street Journal'' (March 19, 1999).

In [[angiosperms]], a '''hypanthium''' or '''floral cup'''{{sfn|Foster|2014|loc=[http://plant-phytography.blogspot.ca/2012/10/hypanthium-cup-shaped-or-tubular.html Hypanthium]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Beentje, H. |author2=Williamson, J. |year=2010  |title=The Kew Plant Glossary: an Illustrated Dictionary of Plant Terms |publisher=Kew Publishing |location=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hickey, M. |author2=King, C. |year=2001  |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press   }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a structure where basal portions of the [[Sepal|calyx]], the [[petal|corolla]], and the [[stamen]]s form a cup-shaped tube. It is sometimes called a '''floral tube''', a term that is also used for [[corolla tube]] and [[calyx tube]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It often contains the [[nectar]]ies of the [[plant]]. It is present in most flowering species, although varies in structural dimensions and appearance.{{sfn|Cronquist|1981}} This differentiation between the hypanthium in particular species is useful for [[plant identification|identification]]. Some [[geometry|geometric]] forms are [[obconic]] shapes as  in [[heteromeles|toyon]], whereas some are saucer-shaped as in ''[[Mitella caulescens]]''.

Its presence is diagnostic of many [[family (biology)|families]], including the [[Rosaceae]], [[Grossulariaceae]], and [[Fabaceae]]. In some cases, it can be so deep, with such a narrow top, that the flower can appear to have an [[anatomical terms of location|inferior]] [[ovary (botany)|ovary]] - the ovary is below the other attached floral parts. The hypanthium is known by different common names in differing species. In the [[eucalypt]]s, it is referred to as the ''gum nut''; in roses it is called the [[rose hip|hip]].

==Variations in plant species==
[[File:Ovary position superior with hypanthium.png|thumb|Ovary superior to hypanthium]]
[[File:2013-04-29 16-35-13-fleur-58f.jpg|thumb|right|In ''[[Spiraea]]'' the hypanthium supports a nectar-producing "disk" which is ring-shaped and may have lobes as it does here. The stamens arise between the petals and the disk.]]
[[File:Flower morphology - longitudinal section showing achene formation and hypanthium in Rosa-01.svg|thumb|Hypanthum in [[Rose|Rosa]]]]
[[File:20140226Narcissus pseudonarcissus2.jpg|thumb|''Narcissus pseudonarcissus'', showing from the upper bend to the tip of the flower: [[spathe]], ovary, hypanthium, [[tepal]]s, [[perianth#Corona|corona]]]]
In [[myrtles]] the hypanthium can either surround the ovary loosely or tightly; in some cases it can be fused to the walls of the ovary. It can vary in length. The rims around the outside of the hypanthium contain the calyx lobes or free sepals, [[petal]]s and either the stamen or multiple stamen that are attached at one or two points. 
The flowers of the family Rosaceae always have some type of hypanthium or at least a floral cup from which the sepals, petals and stamens all arise. In the [[Rosaceae|family Rosaceae]], or the [[rose]] family, the hypanthium is lined with nectar-producing tissue known as [[nectar]]ies. The nectar is a sugary substance that attracts [[bird]]s and [[bee]]s to the flower, who then take the pollen from the lining of the hypanthium and transfer it to the next flower they visit, usually a neighbouring plant.{{sfn|Givnish|1997}}

The stamens borne on the hypanthium are the pollen-producing [[sex organ|reproductive organs]] of the flower. The hypanthium helps in many ways with the reproduction and [[pollination|cross pollination]] pathways of most plants. It provides [[weather]] protection and a medium to sustain the lost pollen, increasing the probability of fertility and cross-pollination.{{sfn|Clarke|2004}} The retained pollen can then attach to [[pollinator]]s such as [[bird]]s, [[bee]]s, [[moth]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[bat]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]] and other [[animal]]s. [[Wind]] can act as an instigator for [[fertilisation]]. The hypanthium is also an adaptive feature for structural support. It helps the [[plant stem|stem]] fuse together with the flower, in turn strengthening the bond and overall stability and integrity.{{sfn|Snow|2003}}

In [[statistical genetics]], '''inclusive composite interval mapping''' (ICIM) has been proposed as an approach to [[QTL mapping|QTL (quantitative trait locus) mapping]] for populations derived from bi-parental crosses. QTL mapping is based on genetic linkage map and phenotypic data and attempts to locate individual genetic factors on chromosomes and to estimate their genetic effects.

==Additive and dominance QTL mapping==
Two genetic assumptions used in ICIM are (1) the genotypic value of an individual is the summation of effects from all genes affecting the trait of interest; and (2) linked QTL are separated by at least one blank marker interval. Under the two assumptions, they proved that additive effect of the QTL located in a marker interval can be completely absorbed by the regression coefficients of the two flanking markers, while the QTL dominance effect causes marker dominance effects, as well as additive by additive and dominance by dominance interactions between the two flanking markers. By including two multiplication variables between flanking markers, the additive and dominance effects of one QTL can be completely absorbed. As a consequence, an inclusive linear model of phenotype regressing on all genetic markers (and marker multiplications) can be used to fit the positions, and additive (and dominance) effects of all QTL in the genome.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1534/genetics.106.066811 |author= Li, H., G.

In the first step, [[stepwise regression]] was applied to identify the most significant marker variables in the linear model. In the second step, one-dimensional scanning or interval mapping was conducted for detecting QTL and estimating its additive and dominance effects, based on the phenotypic values adjusted by the regression model in the first step.

==Genetic and statistical properties in additive QTL mapping==
Through computer simulations they studied the asymptotic properties of ICIM in additive QTL mapping as well. The test statistic LOD score linearly increases as the increase in population size. The larger of the QTL effect, the greater the corresponding LOD score increases. When population size is greater than 200, the position estimation of ICIM for QTL explaining more than 5% of the phenotypic variance is unbiased. For smaller population size, there is a tendency that the QTL was identified towards the center of the chromosome. When population size is greater than 200, the effect estimation of ICIM for QTL explaining more than 5% of phenotypic variance is unbiased. For smaller sample size, the QTL effect was always overestimated.

==Digenic epistasis mapping==
Under the same assumptions in additive and dominance QTL mapping of ICIM, an additive by additive epistatic effect between two interacting QTL can be completely absorbed by the four marker interaction variables between the two pairs of flanking markers [5]. That is to say, the coefficients of four marker interactions of two pairs of flanking markers contain the genetic information of the additive by additive epistasis between the two marker intervals.&lt;ref name="Li2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1007/s00122-007-0663-5 |author= Li, H., Z.

Similar to the additive QTL mapping of ICIM, two-step strategy was also adopted in additive by additive epistasis mapping. In the first step, stepwise regression was applied to identify the most significant marker and marker interactions. In the second step, two-dimensional scanning was conducted for detecting additive by additive QTL and estimating the genetic effects, based on the phenotypic values adjusted by the regression model in the first step.

==Applications in real mapping populations==
Take a barley doubled haploid population &lt;ref name="Tinker"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.2135/cropsci1996.0011183X003600040040x |author= Tinker, N. A., D. E. Mather, B. G. Rossnagel, K. J. Kasha, A.

In this population additive effects have explained most of the phenotypic variance, approximating the estimated heritability in the broad sense, which indicates that most of the genetic variance was caused by additive QTL.

==Joint QTL mapping in multiple families or populations==
Bi-parental populations are mostly used in QTL linkage mapping. QTL not segregating between the two parents cannot be detected. To find most, if not all, genes controlling a trait of interest, multiple parents have to be used. Complex cross populations have been proposed in recent years for this purpose. These crosses allow a more powerful understanding of the genetic basis of quantitative traits in more relevant genetic backgrounds. They extended ICIM to map Maize [[Nested Association Mapping]] (NAM).&lt;ref name="NAM"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1174320 |author1=Michael D.

QTL detection efficiency of ICIM in this design was investigated through extensive simulations. In the actual maize NAM population, ICIM detected a total of 52 additive QTL affecting the silk flowering time in maize. These QTL have explained 79% of the phenotypic variance in this population.

==Software for QTL mapping==
There is  software that implements ICIM additive and epistasis mapping. Its function is: (1) implementation of mapping methods including single marker analysis, interval mapping, ICIM for additive and dominance, ICIM for digenic epistasis, selective phenotyping, etc.; (2) QTL linkage analysis more than twenty mapping populations derived from bi-parental cross, including backcross, double haploid, recombinant inbred lines, etc.; (3) Power analysis for simulated populations under the genetic models user defined; and (4) QTL mapping for non-idealized chromosome segment substitution lines .&lt;ref name="Wang2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1017/S0016672306008408 |author1=Wang J |author2=X.

{{Star formation}}
In [[astronomy]], the '''interstellar medium''' ('''ISM''') is the [[matter]] and radiation that exists in the [[outer space|space]] between the [[star system]]s in a [[galaxy]]. This matter includes [[gas]] in [[ion]]ic, [[atom]]ic, and [[molecular]] form, as well as [[cosmic dust|dust]] and [[cosmic ray]]s. It fills [[interstellar space]] and blends smoothly into the surrounding [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|intergalactic space]]. The [[energy]] that occupies the same volume, in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], is the '''interstellar radiation field'''.

The interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases, distinguished by whether matter is ionic, atomic, or molecular, and the temperature and density of the matter. The interstellar medium is composed primarily of [[hydrogen]] followed by [[helium]] with trace amounts of [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]] comparatively to hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herbst|first=Eric|date=1995|title=Chemistry in The Interstellar Medium|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.pc.46.100195.000331|journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry|pages=|bibcode=1995ARPC...46...27H|doi=10.1146/annurev.pc.46.100195.000331|pmid=|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal [[pressures]] of these phases are in rough equilibrium with one another. [[Magnetic field]]s and [[turbulent]] motions also provide pressure in the ISM, and are typically more important [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamically]] than the thermal pressure is.

In all phases, the interstellar medium is extremely tenuous by terrestrial standards. In cool, dense regions of the ISM, matter is primarily in molecular form, and reaches number [[density|densities]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1 million molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). In hot, diffuse regions of the ISM, matter is primarily ionized, and the density may be as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; ions per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Compare this with a number density of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for air at sea level, and 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (10 billion molecules per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for a laboratory high-vacuum chamber. By [[mass]], 99% of the ISM is gas in any form, and 1% is dust.&lt;ref name=Boulanger&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Boulanger, F. |author2=Cox, P. |author3=Jones, A. P. | title = Course 7: Dust in the Interstellar Medium | booktitle = Infrared Space Astronomy, Today and Tomorrow | year = 2000 |editor1=F. Casoli |editor2=J. Lequeux |editor3=F. David | pages = 251 | bibcode=2000isat.conf..251B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the gas in the ISM, by number 91% of atoms are [[hydrogen]] and 8.9% are [[helium]], with 0.1% being atoms of elements heavier than hydrogen or helium,&lt;ref name=Ferriere2001&gt;[[#Ferriere2001|Ferriere (2001)]]&lt;/ref&gt; known as "[[metallicity|metals]]" in astronomical parlance. By mass this amounts to 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements. The hydrogen and helium are primarily a result of [[primordial nucleosynthesis]], while the heavier elements in the ISM are mostly a result of enrichment in the process of [[stellar evolution]].

The ISM plays a crucial role in [[astrophysics]] precisely because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, which ultimately contributes to [[molecular cloud]]s and replenishes the ISM with matter and energy through [[planetary nebula]]e, [[solar wind|stellar winds]], and [[supernova]]e. This interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous content, and therefore its lifespan of active star formation.

''[[Voyager 1]]'' reached the ISM on August 25, 2012, making it the first artificial object from Earth to do so. Interstellar plasma and dust will be studied until the mission's end in 2025.

===The three-phase model===

{{harvtxt|Field|Goldsmith|Habing|1969}} put forward the static two ''phase'' equilibrium model to explain the observed properties of the ISM. Their modeled ISM consisted of a cold dense phase (''T''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]), consisting of clouds of neutral and molecular hydrogen, and a warm intercloud phase (''T''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]), consisting of rarefied neutral and ionized gas. {{harvtxt|McKee|Ostriker|1977}} added a dynamic third phase that represented the very hot (''T''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) gas which had been shock heated by [[supernova]]e and constituted most of the volume of the ISM.
These phases are the temperatures where heating and cooling can reach a stable equilibrium. Their paper formed the basis for further study over the past three decades. However, the relative proportions of the phases and their subdivisions are still not well known.&lt;ref name=Ferriere2001 /&gt;

===The atomic hydrogen model===
This model takes into account only atomic hydrogen : Temperature larger than 3000 K breaks molecules, lower than 50 000 K leaves atoms in their ground state. It is assumed that influence of other atoms (He ...) is negligible.  Pressure is assumed very low, so that durations of free paths of atoms are larger than ~ 1 nanosecond duration of light pulses which make ordinary, temporally incoherent light .

In this collisionless gas, Einstein’s theory of coherent light-matter interactions applies, all gas-light interactions are spatially coherent. 
Suppose that a monochromatic light is pulsed, then scattered by molecules having a quadrupole (Raman) resonance frequency. If “length of light pulses is shorter than all involved time constants” (Lamb (1971)), an “impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) ” (Yan, Gamble &amp; Nelson (1985)) works: While light generated by incoherent Raman at a shifted frequency has a phase independent on phase of exciting light, thus generates a new spectral line, coherence between incident and scattered light allows their interference into a single frequency, thus shifts incident frequency.
Assume that a star radiates a continuous light spectrum up to X rays. Lyman frequencies are absorbed in this light and pump atoms mainly to first excited state. In this state, hyperfine periods are longer than 1 ns, so that an ISRS “may” redshift light frequency, populating high hyperfine levels. An other ISRS “may” transfer energy from hyperfine levels to thermal electromagnetic waves, so that redshift is permanent. Temperature of a light beam is defined from frequency and spectral radiance by Planck’s formula. As entropy must increase, “may” becomes “does”. 
However, where a previously absorbed line (first Lyman beta, ...) reaches Lyman alpha frequency, redshifting process stops and all hydrogen lines are strongly absorbed. But the stop is not perfect if there is energy at frequency shifted to Lyman beta frequency, which produces a slow redshift. Successive redshifts separated by Lyman absorptions generate many absorption lines, frequencies of which, deduced from absorption process, obey a law more dependable than Karlsson’s formula.

The previous process excites more and more atoms because a de-excitation obeys Einstein’s law of coherent interactions: Variation dI of radiance I of a light beam along a path dx is dI=BIdx,  where B is Einstein amplification coefficient which depends on medium.  I is the modulus of Poynting vector of field, absorption occurs for an opposed vector, which corresponds to a change of sign of B. Factor I in this formula shows that intense rays are more amplified than weak ones (competition of modes). Emission of a flare requires a sufficient radiance I provided by random zero point field. After emission of a flare, weak B increases by pumping while I remains close to zero: De-excitation by a coherent emission involves stochastic parameters of zero point field, as observed close to quasars (and in polar auroras).

===Structures===
[[File:Three-dim-pillars-creation.jpg|thumb|Three-dimensional structure in [[Pillars of Creation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pillars of Creation Revealed in 3D|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1518/|accessdate=14 June 2015 |publisher=European Southern Observatory |date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The ISM is [[turbulence|turbulent]] and therefore full of structure on all spatial scales. [[Star formation|Stars are born]] deep inside large complexes of [[molecular clouds]], typically a few [[parsec]]s in size. During their lives and deaths, [[star]]s interact physically with the ISM.

[[Stellar wind]]s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant [[HII region]]s surrounding them) and [[shock wave]]s created by [[supernova]]e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures – of varying sizes – can be observed, such as [[stellar wind bubble]]s and [[superbubble]]s of hot gas, seen by X-ray satellite telescopes or turbulent flows observed in [[radio telescope]] maps.

The [[Sun]] is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]], a denser region in the low-density [[Local Bubble]].

===Interaction with interplanetary medium===
[[File:Short, narrated video about IBEX's interstellar matter observations.ogv|thumb|left|350px|Short, narrated video about [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|IBEX's]] interstellar matter observations.]]
The interstellar medium begins where the [[interplanetary medium]] of the [[Solar System]] ends. The [[solar wind]] slows to [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities at the [[termination shock]], 90—100 [[astronomical unit]]s from the [[Sun]]. In the region beyond the termination shock, called the [[heliosheath]], interstellar matter interacts with the solar wind. [[Voyager 1]], the farthest human-made object from the Earth (after 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/fastfacts.html |title=Voyager: Fast Facts |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;), crossed the termination shock December 16, 2004 and later entered interstellar space when it crossed the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] on August 25, 2012, providing the first direct probe of conditions in the ISM {{harvard citation|Stone|Cummings|McDonald|Heikkila|2005}}.

===Interstellar extinction===

The ISM is also responsible for [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] and [[interstellar reddening|reddening]], the decreasing [[Radiance|light intensity]] and shift in the dominant observable [[wavelength]]s of light from a star. These effects are caused by scattering and absorption of [[photon]]s and allow the ISM to be observed with the naked eye in a dark sky. The apparent rifts that can be seen in the band of the [[Milky Way]] – a uniform disk of stars – are caused by absorption of background starlight by molecular clouds within a few thousand light years from Earth.

[[Far ultraviolet|Far ultraviolet light]] is absorbed effectively by the neutral components of the ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic [[hydrogen]] lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] transition. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because most of it is absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen.

== Heating and cooling ==

The ISM is usually far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Collisions establish a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] of velocities, and the 'temperature' normally used to describe interstellar gas is the 'kinetic temperature', which describes the temperature at which the particles would have the observed Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, the interstellar radiation field is typically much weaker than a medium in thermodynamic equilibrium; it is most often roughly that of an [[Stellar classification#Class A|A star]] (surface temperature of ~10,000 [[Kelvin|K]]) highly diluted. Therefore, [[energy level|bound levels]] within an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] in the ISM are rarely populated according to the Boltzmann formula {{harv|Spitzer|1978|loc=&amp;sect; 2.4}}.

Depending on the temperature, density, and ionization state of a portion of the ISM, different heating and cooling mechanisms determine the temperature of the [[gas]].

=== Heating mechanisms ===

; Heating by low-energy [[cosmic ray]]s: The first mechanism proposed for heating the ISM was heating by low-energy [[cosmic rays]]. [[Cosmic ray]]s are an efficient heating source able to penetrate in the depths of molecular clouds. [[Cosmic ray]]s transfer energy to [[gas]] through both ionization and excitation and to free [[electron]]s through [[Coulomb]] interactions. Low-energy [[cosmic ray]]s (a few [[MeV]]) are more important because they are far more numerous than high-energy [[cosmic ray]]s.

; Photoelectric heating by grains: The [[ultraviolet]] radiation emitted by hot [[star]]s can remove [[electron]]s from dust grains. The [[photon]] is absorbed by the dust grain, and some of its energy is used to overcome the potential energy barrier and remove the [[electron]] from the grain. This potential barrier is due to the binding energy of the electron (the [[work function]]) and the charge of the grain. The remainder of the photon's energy gives the ejected [[electron]] [[kinetic energy]] which heats the gas through collisions with other particles. A typical size distribution of dust grains is ''n''(''r'')&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''r''{{sup|−3.5}}, where ''r'' is the radius of the dust particle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Mathis, J.S. | author2=Rumpl, W. | author3=Nordsieck, K.H. | title=The size distribution of interstellar grains|journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=217 | pages=425 | bibcode=1977ApJ...217..425M | doi=10.1086/155591}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Assuming this, the projected grain surface area distribution is ''πr''{{sup|2}}''n''(''r'')&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''r''{{sup|−1.5}}. This indicates that the smallest dust grains dominate this method of heating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Weingartner, J.C. | author2=Draine, B.T. | title=Photoelectric Emission from Interstellar Dust: Grain Charging and Gas Heating | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=134 | pages=263 | bibcode=2001ApJS..134..263W | doi=10.1086/320852| arxiv=astro-ph/9907251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

; Photoionization: When an [[electron]] is freed from an [[atom]] (typically from absorption of a UV [[photon]]) it carries kinetic energy away of the order ''E''{{sub|photon}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''E''{{sub|ionization}}. This heating mechanism dominates in H&amp;nbsp;II regions, but is negligible in the diffuse ISM due to the relative lack of neutral [[carbon]] [[atom]]s.

; [[X-ray]] heating: [[X-ray]]s remove [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s and [[ion]]s, and those photoelectrons can provoke secondary ionizations. As the intensity is often low, this heating is only efficient in warm, less dense atomic medium (as the column density is small). For example, in molecular clouds only hard [[x-ray]]s can penetrate and [[x-ray]] heating can be ignored. This is assuming the region is not near an [[x-ray]] source such as a [[supernova remnant]].

; Chemical heating: Molecular [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be formed on the surface of dust grains when two [[Hydrogen|H]] atoms (which can travel over the grain) meet. This process yields 4.48&amp;nbsp;eV of energy distributed over the rotational and vibrational modes, kinetic energy of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, as well as heating the dust grain. This kinetic energy, as well as the energy transferred from de-excitation of the hydrogen molecule through collisions, heats the gas.

; Grain-gas heating: Collisions at high densities between gas atoms and molecules with dust grains can transfer thermal energy. This is not important in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It is also not important in diffuse ionized medium due to the low density. In the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not effectively cool the gas due to the low densities.

Grain heating by thermal exchange is very important in supernova remnants where densities and temperatures are very high.

Gas heating via grain-gas collisions is dominant deep in giant molecular clouds (especially at high densities). Far [[infrared]] radiation penetrates deeply due to the low optical depth. Dust grains are heated via this radiation and can transfer thermal energy during collisions with the gas. A measure of efficiency in the heating is given by the accommodation coefficient:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{T_2 - T}{T_d - T}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' is the gas temperature, ''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' the dust temperature, and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the post-collision temperature of the gas atom or molecule. This coefficient was measured by {{harvard citation|Burke|Hollenbach|1983}} as ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.35.

; Other heating mechanisms: A variety of macroscopic heating mechanisms are present including:
:* [[Gravitational collapse]] of a cloud
:* [[Supernova]] explosions
:* [[Stellar wind]]s
:* Expansion of [[H II region|H&amp;nbsp;II regions]]
:* [[Magnetohydrodynamic]] waves created by supernova remnants

=== Cooling mechanisms ===

; Fine structure cooling: The process of fine structure cooling is dominant in most regions of the Interstellar Medium, except regions of hot [[gas]] and regions deep in molecular clouds. It occurs most efficiently with abundant [[atom]]s having fine structure levels close to the fundamental level such as: C&amp;nbsp;II and O&amp;nbsp;I in the neutral medium and O&amp;nbsp;II, O&amp;nbsp;III, N&amp;nbsp;II, N&amp;nbsp;III, Ne&amp;nbsp;II and Ne&amp;nbsp;III in H&amp;nbsp;II regions. Collisions will excite these atoms to higher levels, and they will eventually de-excite through photon emission, which will carry the energy out of the region.

; Cooling by permitted lines: At lower temperatures, more levels than fine structure levels can be populated via collisions. For example, collisional excitation of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 level of [[hydrogen]] will release a Ly-α photon upon de-excitation. In molecular clouds, excitation of rotational lines of [[carbon monoxide|CO]] is important. Once a [[molecule]] is excited, it eventually returns to a lower energy state, emitting a photon which can leave the region, cooling the cloud.

== Radiowave propagation ==
[[File:Micrwavattrp.png|thumb|400px|Atmospheric attenuation in [[decibel|dB]]/km as a function of frequency over the EHF band. Peaks in absorption at specific frequencies are a problem, due to atmosphere constituents such as water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

Radio waves from ≈10&amp;nbsp;kHz ([[very low frequency]]) to ≈300&amp;nbsp;GHz ([[extremely high frequency]]) propagate differently in interstellar space than on the Earth's surface. There are many sources of interference and signal distortion that do not exist on Earth. A great deal of [[radio astronomy]] depends on compensating for the different propagation effects to uncover the desired signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvKDoQVevAI | title= Interstellar Medium Interference (video) | author=Samantha Blair | work=SETI Talks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkb0o-oUbso | title=Voyager 1 Experiences Three Tsunami Waves in Interstellar Space (video) | work=JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of knowledge of interstellar space==
[[File:Herbig-Haro object HH 110.jpeg|thumb|[[Herbig–Haro 110]] object ejects gas through interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A geyser of hot gas flowing from a star|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1210/|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The nature of the interstellar medium has received the attention of astronomers and scientists over the centuries, and [[Timeline of knowledge about the interstellar and intergalactic medium|understanding of the ISM has developed]]. However, they first had to acknowledge the basic concept of "interstellar" space. The term appears to have been first used in print by {{harvtxt|Bacon|1626|loc=&amp;sect; 354–5}}: "The Interstellar Skie.. hath .. so much Affinity with the Starre, that there is a Rotation of that, as well as of the Starre." Later, [[natural philosopher]] {{harvard citations|first=Robert | last=Boyle | year=1674 | txt=yes | authorlink=Robert Boyle}} discussed "The inter-stellar part of heaven, which several of the modern [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] would have to be empty."

Before modern [[electromagnetic theory]], early [[physicist]]s postulated that an invisible [[luminiferous aether]] existed as a medium to carry lightwaves. It was assumed that this aether extended into interstellar space, as {{harvtxt|Patterson|1862}} wrote, "this efflux occasions a thrill, or vibratory motion, in the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] which fills the interstellar spaces."

The advent of deep photographic imaging allowed [[Edward Emerson Barnard|Edward Barnard]] to produce the first images of [[dark nebula]]e silhouetted against the background star field of the galaxy, while the first actual detection of cold diffuse matter in interstellar space was made by [[Johannes Franz Hartmann|Johannes Hartmann]] in 1904&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|authorlink=Isaac Asimov|first=Isaac|last=Asimov|title=[[Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]]|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the use of [[absorption spectrum|absorption line spectroscopy]]. In his historic study of the spectrum and orbit of [[Delta Orionis]], Hartmann observed the light coming from this star and realized that some of this light was being absorbed before it reached the Earth. Hartmann reported that absorption from the "K" line of [[calcium]] appeared "extraordinarily weak, but almost perfectly sharp" and also reported the "quite surprising result that the calcium line at 393.4&amp;nbsp;nanometres does not share in the periodic displacements of the lines caused by the orbital motion of the [[spectroscopic binary]] star". The stationary nature of the line led Hartmann to conclude that the gas responsible for the absorption was not present in the atmosphere of Delta Orionis, but was instead located within an isolated cloud of matter residing somewhere along the line-of-sight to this star. This discovery launched the study of the Interstellar Medium.

In the series of investigations, [[Viktor Ambartsumian]] introduced the now commonly accepted notion that interstellar matter occurs in the form of clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= To Victor Ambartsumian on his 80th birthday | author=S. Chandrasekhar | author-link=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | journal= Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy | volume=18 | pages=3 | doi=10.1007/BF01005852|bibcode = 1988Ap.....29..408C | year= 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hartmann's identification of interstellar calcium absorption, interstellar [[sodium]] was detected by {{harvtxt|Heger|1919}} through the observation of stationary absorption from the atom's "D" lines at 589.0 and 589.6 nanometres towards Delta Orionis and [[Beta Scorpii]].

Subsequent observations of the "H" and "K" lines of calcium by {{harvtxt|Beals|1936}} revealed double and asymmetric profiles in the spectra of [[Epsilon Orionis|Epsilon]] and [[Zeta Orionis]]. These were the first steps in the study of the very complex interstellar sightline towards [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Asymmetric absorption line profiles are the result of the superposition of multiple absorption lines, each corresponding to the same atomic transition (for example the "K" line of calcium), but occurring in interstellar clouds with different [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]]. Because each cloud has a different velocity (either towards or away from the observer/Earth) the absorption lines occurring within each cloud are either [[Blueshift|Blue-shifted]] or [[Red shift|Red-shifted]] (respectively) from the lines' rest wavelength, through the [[Doppler Effect]]. These observations confirming that matter is not distributed homogeneously were the first evidence of multiple discrete clouds within the ISM.

[[File:Hubble sees a cosmic caterpillar.jpg|thumb|This light-year-long knot of interstellar gas and dust resembles a [[caterpillar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble sees a cosmic caterpillar|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1335a/|work=Image Archive|publisher=ESA/Hubble|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The growing evidence for interstellar material led {{harvtxt|Pickering|1912}} to comment that "While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, yet the character of its selective absorption, as indicated by [[Jacobus Kapteyn|Kapteyn]], is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous [[molecule]]s are certainly there, since they are probably constantly being expelled by the [[Sun]] and [[star]]s."

The same year [[Victor Francis Hess|Victor Hess]]'s discovery of [[cosmic rays]], highly energetic charged particles that rain onto the Earth from space, led others to speculate whether they also pervaded interstellar space. The following year the Norwegian explorer and physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]] wrote: "It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric [[ion]]s of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar systems or [[nebula]]e, but in 'empty' space" {{harv|Birkeland|1913}}.

{{harvtxt|Thorndike|1930}} noted that "it could scarcely have been believed that the enormous gaps between the stars are completely void. Terrestrial aurorae are not improbably excited by charged particles emitted by the [[Sun]].&lt;!--transcription: one of these phrases may be duplicative--&gt; If the millions of other [[star]]s are also ejecting [[ion]]s, as is undoubtedly true, no absolute vacuum can exist within the galaxy."

In September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]], subjected to ''interstellar medium (ISM)'' conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[Oxygenate|oxygenation]] and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[Organic compound|organics]] – "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{Citation|author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=756 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|accessdate=September 22, 2012 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G |issue=1 |pages=L24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[Cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901" /&gt;

In February 2014, [[NASA]] announced a [http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ greatly upgraded database] for tracking [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the [[carbon]] in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible [[PAH world hypothesis|starting materials]] for the [[Abiogenesis#PAH world hypothesis|formation]] of [[Life#Extraterrestrial life|life]]. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the [[Big Bang]], are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with [[Star formation|new stars]] and [[exoplanets]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140221"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

==Plot==
A remote village named Pali in [[Andhra Pradesh]] is struck by an unknown disease, with several villagers dying each month. The village Tantrik ([[Rao Ramesh]]) predicts a powerful man will come to their rescue as God. He assigns his assistant Siddhappa ([[Shafi (actor)|Shafi]]) with the duty to find a man with such supernatural power and bring him to their village.

Meanwhile, Alluri Seetarama Raju ([[Mahesh Babu]]) is a [[Taxicab|cab]] driver who lives in [[Hyderabad]] with his grandfather ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]), a teacher. He is currently in [[Rajasthan]] in search of the family of a man named Bilavar Singh. In his journey, he meets a [[Gemini TV]] reporter Baabji ([[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]]), who comes to Rajasthan to shoot a travel documentary. Raju introduces himself to Baabji and tells him the reason for him being in Rajasthan. He describes a woman named Subhashini ([[Anushka Shetty]]), whom he considers brings bad luck to him. Previously, he encountered her in various occasions in which she damages his taxi due to her reckless driving. Raju lands in the hospital one day when Subhashini mixes an [[epsom salt]] [[laxative]] in Raju's [[coffee]], thinking it meets her at a [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] to collect the compensation for his taxi's damages from her, though this was meant for someone else. One day, he drives two men, [[geology]] scientist Dr. Paranji and his assistant Bilavar to their destination the [[Geological Survey of India]]. But he sees them getting gunned down by some henchmen, and Bilavar falls out of a window and lands on Raju's taxi, destroying it. Since Bilavar has insurance, Raju's boss tells him to deliver the insurance check of Rs. 5,00,000 to Bilavar's family in Girdwala, Rajasthan and get Rs. 1,00,000 in return to pay for his car damages.

Meanwhile, Subhashini's father, [[business magnate]] Durga Prasad ([[Tanikella Bharani]]), brings her a match, another business magnate GK's ([[Prakash Raj]]) son ([[Amit Tiwari]]). The main reason for the proposal is to establish a strong business partnership. GK's son takes her to Rajasthan for a date. Subhashini runs away after she sees a [[condom]] drop from his pocket. GK finds out about it, informs Prasad, and promises to bring Subhashini back. He sends his henchman Govardhan ([[Subbaraju]]) to Rajasthan in search of Subhashini. Subhashini finds Raju and Baabji and learns she is in Rajasthan. Subhashini, Baabji, Raju, and a [[botanist]] Tom Cruise ([[Ali (actor)|Ali]]) find Girdwala and hand the check to Bilavar's family, but Raju refuses to ask for the Rs. 1,00,000 when he sees the family's poverty. Tom remains in the village as the villagers want to punish him for cutting a sentimental plant. Baabji goes away with his shooting team but does not offer them a ride.

As Raju and Subhashini return, Govardhan's men stab Raju and take Subhashini after knocking her unconscious. Raju survives, fights, and kills almost all of Govardhan's men. Just as Raju goes unconscious, Sidhappa finds him and believes he is the God after seeing the omens. Sidhappa and Subhashini take Raju to Pali, where the villagers treat his wounds. After waking up, he finds all of the villagers praising him as their God. He finds out from Subhashini that they are in Pali, and that the villagers see him as the supernatural godsend who will rescue the village. Initially reluctant to help them out, he escapes to Hyderabad, where he hands over Subhashini to her father. After realizing Tom and Siddappa followed him to Hyderabad, Raju puts fate to the test and when he understands the concept of deityhood and god, he makes it a goal to solve the mystical series of deaths in the village. After tracking down a doctor, the dean of the medical college run by GK, Govardhan, and GK's lawyer Miriyam ([[Brahmanandam]]), Raju discovers the [[plastic]] factory in Pali deposits its wastes in the drinking water source nearby, thus contaminating and killing the villagers. GK actually wants the villagers in Pali to die, which was why he had the Government's medical camp removed periodically. He finds GK's assistant ([[Veda Sastry|Archana]]) and suspects she has something to do with GK's plan as she did not get into his taxi along with Paranji, indicating she knew beforehand that he was going to be killed. Raju inquires her about GK's intentions, who reveals that Paranji discovered earlier that there is a large [[iridium]] deposit under Pali, which is worth billions, and informed GK about it.

Despite GK's warning to Paranji of not revealing it to anybody else, he tries to inform the Geological Survey of India about the deposits, which was why he and Bilavar, who was with him, were killed that day. GK suspects that Raju might also know about the iridium deposit because he was with Paranji when he was killed which was why GK sent Govardhan to kill him. Raju was lured to Girdwala under the cover of delivering the insurance check to Bilavar's family and was attacked by Govardhan. GK needs the strong plastic glass from the plastic factory to pack the iridium. He wanted the Pali villagers to vacate on their own to avoid suspicion, which was why he poisoned Pali's environment using the plastic factory's waste.

GK kills his assistant and Govardhan for their failures. He then heads to Pali to kill all the villagers. The village head warns GK that Raju is their God, that he would bring death to GK, and keep Pali's population at 534, not letting any more die in the process. Raju arrives at Pali with Sidhappa. GK shoots Sidhappa and kills him, reducing the population to 533. Before dying, Siddhappa looks into Raju's eyes, dying after. Raju kills GK's goons and severs GK's palm. A terrified GK starts escaping with Raju in pursuit. Raju catches up to him, and GK dies when a religious knife hanging from a nearby tree falls and stabs him in the neck after Raju curses him to die. The village head reveals Raju fulfilled his mission as God to save the village, because although Sidhappa was killed, another baby was born to keep the village's population at 534. The film ends with a new flag being put up in honor of the new birth.

==Critical reception==
[[Sify]] rated 3 out of 5 explained "No doubt, Mahesh is the cynosure of the movie, shouldering the entire responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/mahesh-khaleja-review-review-telugu-14958111.html |title=Movie Review:Mahesh Khaleja- Review |publisher=Sify.com |accessdate=4 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723072603/http://www.sify.com/movies/mahesh-khaleja-review-review-telugu-14958111.html|archivedate=23 July 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSN]] rated 2.5 out of 5 and described the film as "just an above average venture", commenting, "''Mahesh Khaleja'' is worth a watch for Mahesh's strong screen presence and charisma. Mahesh carries off his role with elan and looks superb too. Anushka looks pretty but doesn't share a good on-screen chemistry with Mahesh. The first half of the film is dull. It does pick up pace in the second half but the narration is inconsistent and tedious. The climax is little better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.in.msn.com/southcinema/reviews/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4450135&amp;page=2 |title=Watch 'Mahesh Khaleja' for Mahesh Babu's charisma – 2 – Reviews &amp;#124; South Cinema &amp;#124; MSN India Entertainment |publisher=Entertainment.in.msn.com |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019173456/http://entertainment.in.msn.com/southcinema/reviews/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4450135&amp;page=2|archivedate=19 October 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rediff]] gave a 2.5 out of 5 rating and noted "The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is effortless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.rediff.com/report/2010/oct/07/south-mahesh-khaleja-review.htm |title=Mahesh Khaleja: Mahesh Babu's show all the way – Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Movies.rediff.com |date=7 October 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN-IBN]] gave a negative review stating "The movie is all about Mahesh Babu and he occupies almost every frame in the movie. Back after a gap of 4 years, Mahesh looks great with stylish costumes. The movie deals with a serious theme but director Trivikram Srinivas mixes it with a lot of unnecessary situational comedy which dilutes the intensity of the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/telugu-review-khaleja-fails-to-pack-a-punch/132981-47-79.html |title=Telugu Review: Khaleja fails to pack a punch – Reviews – Telugu reviews – ibnlive |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1998) Eco School Program (1998 Update). Sydney: NSW Department of Education and Training Curriculum Support Directorate.&lt;/ref&gt; Their purpose is to promote and extend environmental awareness, by presenting [[biodiversity]] as the basis for environmental conservation and [[ecologically sustainable development]]. This is achieved through developing school based [[curricula]] that "engage students interactively with their surrounding environment". Ideally, learnscapes incorporate educational, environmental and social outcomes that reflect the character of the community as well as the school site.

"A Learnscape feature, whether it be an outdoor classroom, worm farm, bush regeneration, recycling area, frog pond or herb garden, is not a Learnscape itself. It is the collaborative process within which the feature is created and plans for how it will be maintained and used for learning once it is created that make the feature a Learnscape".&lt;ref&gt;Learnscapes: Making significant changes in Australian schoolyards.

The IPF is carrying out fundamental as well as application-oriented research in all areas of [[polymer science]] and investigates [[polymer]] materials with new or improved characteristics. In the material development, emphasis is given to [[nanotechnological]] aspects as well as to biosystem interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home/], Homepage [[IPF Dresden]], retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The IPF’s research program is jointly set up and implemented by scientists of the different IPF institutes. It comprises the following four research areas:

* Functional nanostructured interfaces and polymer systems
* Biology-inspired interface and material design

==History==
The IPF Dresden was founded on January 1, 1992 emerging from the largest polymer research center of the former [[GDR]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home/history/], [[IPF Dresden]]: History, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; which was at the time already internationally acknowledged. Since then the IPF Dresden developed into a leading institute in selected topics of polymer science.
At present the IPF employs about 480 people, and about 100 guest scientists from all over the world come every year for some weeks or months to work at the IPF. The annual budget of 25 Million Euro is supplied in equal parts by the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and the German [[federal states]]. In addition to institutional funding the IPF Dresden raises project resources of about 8 Million Euro per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipfdd.de/en/home/facts//], [[IPF Dresden]]: Facts, retrieved 5 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1787">'''Manufacturing Automation Protocol''' ('''MAP''') was a [[computer network]] standard released in 1982 for interconnection of devices from multiple manufacturers. It was developed by [[General Motors]] to combat the proliferation of incompatible communications standards used by suppliers of [[automation]] products such as [[programmable logic controller|programmable controllers]].&lt;ref name=JDIrwin&gt;J. David Irwin ''The industrial electronics handbook'',CRC Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-8493-8343-9}}, 
 Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985 demonstrations of interoperability were carried out and 21 vendors offered MAP products.  In 1986 the [[Boeing]] corporation merged its ''Technical Office Protocol'' with the MAP standard, and the combined standard was referred to as "MAP/TOP".  The standard was revised several times between the first issue in 1982 and MAP 3.0 in 1987, with significant technical changes that made interoperation between different revisions of the standard difficult.

Although promoted and used by manufacturers such as General Motors, Boeing, and others, it lost market share to the contemporary [[Ethernet]] standard and was not widely adopted. Difficulties included changing protocol specifications, the expense of MAP interface links, and the speed penalty of a token-passing network.&lt;ref name=Laughton&gt;M. A. Laughton and D. J. Warne ''Electrical Engineers Reference Book 16th Edition'', Newnes,London 2003 {{ISBN|0-7506-4637-3}} , Chapter 16 "Programmable Controllers" page 44&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[token bus network]] protocol used by MAP became standardized as IEEE standard 802.4 but this committee disbanded in 2004 due to lack of industry attention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3552">The '''Marxist Literary Group''' ('''MLG''') is an affiliate of the [[Modern Language Association]] centered on scholarly discussion of the contributions of Marxism and the Marxist tradition in the humanities and related disciplines. It holds an annual summer institute, holds sessions at the MLA convention, and publishes the journal ''[[Mediations Journal|Mediations]]''. It is also an affiliate of the Midwest Modern Language Association and occasionally sponsors sessions at other regional MLA conferences.

==History==
The MLG was formed in 1969 by [[Fredric Jameson]] and several of his graduate students at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://mlg.eserver.org/about/a-short-history-of-the-mlg/] A Short History of the MLG&lt;/ref&gt; The group emerged from the 1968 MLA conference in New York City. Whereas groups such as the Radical Caucus focused their energies on pedagogy and social activism, the MLG was concerned with providing a firm theoretical grounding for the New Left as well as cultivating Marxist intellectuals.&lt;ref name=Latimer&gt;Latimer, Dan. "Jameson and Postmodernism." New Left Review, no. 129 (1981), pp. 116-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MLG quickly became the largest affiliate group in the MLA, running 14 sessions at the 1975 conference and organizing Marxist scholars nationwide. The first Institute on Culture and Society took place in St.. Cloud, Minnesota, in 1976, including speakers such as [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Stanley Aronowitz]], [[Terry Eagleton]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], Michael Ryan, Gene Holland, June Howard, and [[John Beverley (Latin Americanist)|John Beverly]]. Subsequent Institutes have dealt with a wide range of topics, including [[cultural studies]], [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[post-colonialism|post-colonial discourse]], [[feminism]], and left politics. A newsletter was set up in the early 1970s, which evolved into the journal Mediations by 1991. These activities were instrumental in allowing Marxist theory and criticism to gain a foothold in the academy.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44469">'''Musical memory''' refers to the ability to remember music-related information, such as melodic content and other progressions of tones or pitches. The differences found between linguistic memory and musical memory have led researchers to theorize that musical memory is encoded differently from language and may constitute an independent part of the [[phonological loop]]. The use of this term is problematic, however, since it implies input from a verbal system, whereas music is in principle nonverbal.&lt;ref name="phil-496"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The processing of pitch combinations In D. Deutsch (Ed.) | journal=The psychology of music, 3rd Edition | volume= | pages=249–325 | year=2013 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381460-9.00007-9}}  [http://philomel.com/pdf/PsyMus_3_Ch7_Pitch_Combinations.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological bases==
Consistent with [[hemispheric lateralization]], there is evidence to suggest that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different components of musical memory. By studying the learning curves of patients who have had damage to either their left or right medial [[temporal lobes]], Wilson &amp; Saling (2008) found hemispheric differences in the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobes in melodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/mp.2008.25.4.303 |author1=Wilson S.J. |author2=Saling M.M. | year = 2008 | title = Contributions of the right and left medial temporal lobes to music memory: evidence from melodic learning difficulties | url = | journal = Music Perception | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 303–314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayotte, Peretz, Rousseau, Bard &amp; Bojanowski (2000) found that those patients who had their left [[middle cerebral artery]] cut in response to an aneurysm suffered greater impairments when performing tasks of musical long-term memory, than those patients who had their right middle cerebral artery cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/brain/123.9.1926 |author1=Ayotte J. |author2=Peretz I. |author3=Rousseau I. |author4=Bard C. |author5=Bojanowski M. | year = 2000 | title = Patterns of music [[agnosia]] associated with middle cerebral artery [[infract]]s | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | issue = 9| pages = 1926–1938 | pmid = 10960056 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they concluded that the left hemisphere is mainly important for musical representation in long-term memory, whereas the right is needed primarily to mediate access to this memory. Sampson and Zatorre (1991) studied patients with severe epilepsy who underwent surgery for relief as well as control subjects. They found deficits in memory recognition for text regardless of whether it was sung or spoken after a left, but not right temporal lobectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.17.4.793 |author1=Samson S. |author2=Zatorre R.J. | year = 1991 | title = Recognition memory for text and melody of songs after unilateral temporal lobe lesion: evidence for dual encoding | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 793–804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, melody recognition when a tune was sung with new words (as compared to encoding) was impaired after either right ''or'' left temporal lobectomy. Finally, after a right but not left temporal lobectomy, impairments of melody recognition occurred in the absence of lyrics. This suggests dual memory codes for musical memory, with the verbal code utilizing the left temporal lobe structures and the melodic relying on the encoding involved.

==Semantic vs. episodic==
Platel (2005) defined musical semantic memory as memory for pieces without memory for the temporal or spatial elements; and musical episodic memory as memory for pieces and the context in which they were learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1196/annals.1360.010 | author = Platel H | year = 2005 | title = Functional neuroimiging of semantic and episodic memory | url = | journal = New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1060 | issue = | pages = 136–147 |bibcode = 2005NYASA1060..136P }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that two distinct patterns of neural activations existed when comparing semantic and episodic components of musical memory. Controlling for processes of early auditory analysis, working memory and mental imagery, Platel found that retrieval of semantic musical memory involved activation in the right inferior and middle frontal gyri, the superior and inferior right temporal gyri, the right anterior cingulate gyrus and [[parietal lobe]] region. There was also some activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyri in the left hemisphere. Retrieval of episodic musical memory resulted in activation bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and the precuneus. Although bilateral activation was found there was dominance in the right hemisphere. This research suggests independence of episodic and semantic musical memory. The [[Levitin Effect]] demonstrates accurate semantic memory for musical pitch and tempo among listeners, even without musical training, and without episodic memory of the original learning context.

==Individual differences==

===Sex===
Gaab, Keenan &amp; Schlaug (2003) found a difference between males and females in the processing and subsequent memory for pitch using fMRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1162/089892903322370735 |author1=Gaab N. |author2=Keenan J.P. |author3=Schlaug G. | year = 2003 | title = The effects of sex on the neural substrates of pitch memory | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 810–820 | pmid = 14511534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, males showed more lateralized activity in the anterior and posterior perisylvin regions with greater activation in the left. Males also had more cerebellar activation than females did. However, females showed more posterior cingulate and [[retrosplenial cortex]] activation than did males. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the behavioural performance did not differ between males and females.

===Handedness===
It has been found by Deutsch&lt;ref name="phil-4"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.622558 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Pitch memory: An advantage for the lefthanded. | journal=Science | volume=199 | issue=4328 | pages=559–560 | year=1978 | pmid=622558 |url=-http://philomel.com/pdf/Science-1978_199_559-560.pdf | format=PDF|bibcode = 1978Sci...199..559D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-25"&gt;{{cite book | author=Deutsch, D. | isbn=978-0-12-343150-9 | editor=J. Herron | chapter=Handedness and Memory for Tonal Pitch |chapterurl=http://philomel.com/pdf/Ch-Handedness-1980.pdf | title=Neuropsychology of Lefthandedness | publisher= Academic Press| format=PDF| pages=263–271 | year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that lefthanders with mixed hand preference  outperform righthanders in tests of short-term memory for pitch.  This may be due to more storage of information on both sides of the brain by the mixed lefthanded group.

==Atypical cases==

===Expertise===
Experts have tremendous experience through practice and education in a particular field. Musical experts use some of the same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Noice H. |author2=Jeffrey J. |author3=Noice T. |author4=Chaffin R. | year = 2008 | title = Memorization by a jazz musician: a case study | url = | journal = Psychology of Music | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 63–79 | doi = 10.1177/0305735607080834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, musical experts may organize [[Musical note|note]]s into [[musical scale|scales]] or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long-term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin &amp; Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00462.x |author1=Chaffin R. |author2=Imreh G. | year = 2002 | title = Practicing perfection: piano performance as expert memory | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 342–349 | pmid = 12137137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This expert used auditory and [[motor memory]] along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they actually use a mental map of the piece allowing them to keep track of the progression of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2478/v10053-008-0050-z |author1=Chaffin R. |author2=Logan T. | year = 2006 | title = Practicing perfection: how concert soloists prepare for performance | url = | journal = Advances in Cognitive Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = 2-3| pages = 113–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.

===Savantism===
A [[savant syndrome]] is described as a person with a low IQ but who has superior performance in one particular field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sloboda J. |author2=Hermelin B. |author3=O'Connor N. | year = 1985 | title = An exceptional musical memory | url = | journal = Music perception | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 155–170 | jstor=40285330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sloboda, Hermelin and O'Connor (1985) discussed a patient, NP, who was able to memorize very complex musical pieces after hearing them three or four times. NP's performance exceeded that of experts with very high IQs. However, his performance on other memory tasks was average for a person with an IQ in his range. They used NP to suggest that high IQ is not needed for the skill of musical memorization and in fact, other factors must be influencing this performance. Miller (1987) also studied a 7 year old child who was said to be a musical savant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0305735687151006 | author = Miller L.K. | year = 1987 | title = Determinants of melody span in a developmentally disabled musical savant | url = | journal = Psychology of Music | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 76–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This child had superior short-term memory for music that was found to be influenced by the attention given to the complexity of the music, the key signature, and repeated configurations within a string. Miller (1987) suggests that a savant's ability is due to encoding the information into already existing meaningful structures in long-term memory.

===Child prodigies===
Ruthsatz &amp; Detterman (2003) define a [[child prodigy|prodigy]] as a child (younger than 10) who is able to excel at "culturally relevant" tasks to an extent that even isn't seen often in professionals in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(03)00050-3 |author1=Ruthsatz J. |author2=Detterman K. | year = 2003 | title = An extraordinary memory: The case study of a musical prodigy | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 509–518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe a case of one particular boy who had already released two CDs (on which he sings in 2 different languages) and was able to play several instruments by the age of 6.

Other observations that were made of this young child were that he had:
* performed numerous concerts
* appeared twice on national TV
* appeared in two movies
* played highly expressive music
* come from a family with no particular abilities in music
* never had lessons, he had just listened to others' pieces used improvisation
* an IQ of 132 (two [[standard deviation]]s above the average)
* an extraordinary memory in all domains

==Amusia==
[[Amusia]] is also known as tone deafness. Amusics primarily have deficits in processing pitch. They also have problems with musical memory, singing and timing. Amusics also cannot tell melodies apart from their rhythm or beat. However, amusics can recognize other sounds at a normal level (i.e. lyrics, voices, and sounds from the environment), therefore demonstrating that amusia is not due to deficits in exposure, hearing or cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000089606 | author = Pearce J.M.S. | year = 2005 | title = Selected observations on amusia | url = | journal = European Neurology | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 145–158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on non-musical memory==
Music has been shown to improve memory in several situations. In one study of musical effects on memory, visual cues (filmed events) were paired with background music. Later, participants who could not recall details of the scene were presented with the background music as a cue and recovered the inaccessible scene information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03197154 |author1=Boltz M. |author2=Schulkind M. |author3=Kantra S. | year = 1991 | title = Effects of background music on the remembering of filmed events | url = | journal = Memory and Cognition | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 593–606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research provides support for memory of text being improved by musical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wallace W. T. | author2 = Siddiqua, N. | year = 1994 | author3 = Harun-ar-Rashid, A. K. M. | title = Memory for Music: Effects of Melody on Recall of Text | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 1471–1485 | doi = 10.1088/0954-3899/20/9/016 | bibcode = 1994JPhG...20.1471I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Words presented by song were remembered significantly better than when presented by speech. Earlier research has supported for this finding, that advertising jingles that pair words with music are remembered better than words alone or spoken words with music in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.76.2.268 | author = Yalch R | year = 1991 | title = Memory in a Jingle Jungle: Music as a Mnemonic Device in Communicating Advertising Slogans | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 268–275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Memory was also enhanced for pairing brands with their proper slogans if the advertising incorporated lyrics and music rather than spoken words and music in the background.

Training in music has also been shown to improve verbal memory in children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0894-4105.17.3.439 |author1=Ho Y. |author2=Cheung M. |author3=Chan Agnes | year = 2003 | title = Music training improves verbal but not visual memory: Cross-sectional and longitudinal explorations in children | url = | journal = Neuropsychology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 439–450 | pmid = 12959510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants trained in music and participants without a musical background were tested for immediate recall of words and recall of words after 15 minute delays. Word lists were presented orally to each participant 3 times and then participants recalled as many words as they could. Even when matched for intelligence, the musically trained participants tested better than non-musically trained participants. The authors of this research suggest that musical training enhances verbal memory processing due to [[neuroanatomical]] changes in the left temporal lobe, (responsible for verbal memory) which is supported by previous research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chan A. |author2=Ho Y. |author3=Cheung M. | year = 1998 | title = Music training improves verbal memory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 396 | issue = 6707| page = 128 | doi = 10.1038/24075 | bibcode = 1998Natur.396..128C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MRI]] has been used to show that this region of the brain is larger in musicians than non-musicians, which may be due to changes in cortical organization contributing to improved cognitive function.

Anecdotal evidence, from an amnesic patient named CH who suffered from declarative memory deficits, was obtained supporting a preserved memory capacity for song titles. CH's unique knowledge of accordion music allowed for experimenters to test verbal and musical associations. When presented with song titles CH was able to successfully play the correct song 100% of the time, and when presented with the melody she chose the appropriate title from several distractors with a 90% success rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/13554790008402712 |author1=Baur B. |author2=Uttner I. |author3=Ilmberger J. |author4=Fesl G. |author5=Mai N. | year = 2000 | title = Music Memory Provides Access to Verbal Knowledge in a Patient with Global Amnesia | url = | journal = Neurocase | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 415–421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interference==
Interference occurs when information in short-term memory interferes with or obstructs the retrieval of other information. Some researchers believe that interference in memory for pitch is due to a general limited capacity of the short-term memory system, regardless of the type of information that it retains. However, Deutsch has shown that memory for pitch is subject to interference based on the presentation of other pitches but not by the presentation of spoken numbers.&lt;ref name="phil-14"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.168.3939.1604 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Tones and numbers: Specificity of interference in immediate memory. | journal=Science | volume=168 | issue=3939 | pages=1604–1605 | year=1970 | pmid=5420547 |url=http://philomel.com/pdf/Science-1970_168_1604-1605.pdf | format=PDF |bibcode = 1970Sci...168.1604D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work
has shown that short-term memory for the pitch of a tone is subject to highly specific effects produced by other tones, which depend on the pitch relationship between the interfering tones and the tone to be remembered.&lt;ref name="phil-31"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.175.4025.1020 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Mapping of Interactions in the Pitch Memory Store. | journal=Science | volume=175 | issue=4025 | pages=1020–1022 | year=1972 | pmid=5009395 |bibcode = 1972Sci...175.1020D }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/Science-1972_175_1020-1022.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-34"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The organization of short term memory for a single acoustic attribute.

Any additional information present at the time of comprehension has the ability to displace the target information from short-term memory. Therefore, there is potential that one's ability to understand and remember will be compromised if one studies with the television or radio on.&lt;ref&gt;Radvansky, G. (2006). ''Human Memory''. Pearson / Allyn and Bacon&lt;/ref&gt;

While studies have reported inconsistent results with regards to music's effect on memory, it has been demonstrated that music is able to interfere with various memory tasks. It has been demonstrated that new situations require new combinations of cognitive processing. This subsequently results in conscious attention being drawn to novel aspects of situations.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, B.(2000) ''Music and memory: An introduction''. The MIT Press. Cambridge 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the loudness of music presentation along with other musical elements can assist in distracting one from normal responses by encouraging attentiveness to the musical information.&lt;ref name="wolfe1983"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3345172 | author = Wolfe D.E. | year = 1983 | title = Effects of Music Loudness on Task Performance and Self-Report of College-Aged Students | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Music Education | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 191–201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention and recall have been shown to be negatively affected by the presence of a distraction.&lt;ref name="Furnham"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0720(199710)11:5&lt;445::AID-ACP472&gt;3.0.CO;2-R |author1=Furnham A. |author2=Bradley A. | year = 1997 | title = Music While You Work: The Differential Distraction of Background Music on the Cognitive Test Performance of Introverts and Extraverts | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 5| pages = 445–455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe (1983) cautions that educators and therapists should be made aware of the potential for environments with sounds occurring simultaneously from many sources (musical and non-musical) to distract and interfere with student learning.&lt;ref name="wolfe1983" /&gt;

===Introversion and extroversion===
Researchers Campbell and Hawley (1982) provided evidence of the regulation of arousal differences between introverts and extroverts. They found that when studying in a library, extroverts were more likely to choose to work in areas with bustle and activity, while introverts were more likely to choose a quiet, secluded area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00140130210121932 |author1=Furnham A. |author2=Strbac L. | year = 2002 | title = Music is as distracting as noise: the diVerential distraction of background music and noise on the cognitive test performance of introverts and extroverts | url = | journal = Ergonomics | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 203–217 | pmid = 11964204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, [[Adrian Furnham]] and Anna Bradley discovered that introverts presented with music at the time of two cognitive tasks (prose recall and reading comprehension) performed significantly worse on a test of memory recall than extroverts who were also presented with music at the time of the tasks. However, if music was not present at the time of the tasks, introverts and extroverts performed at the same level.&lt;ref name="Furnham"/&gt;

===Hemispheric interference===
Recent research has demonstrated that the normal right hemisphere of the brain responds to melody holistically, consistent with [[Gestalt Psychology]], whereas the left hemisphere of the brain evaluates melodic passages in a more analytic fashion, similar to the feature-detecting capacity of the left hemisphere's visual field.&lt;ref name="regalski1977"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3395266 | author = Regelski T.A. | year = 1977 | title = Who Knows Where Music Lurks in the Mind of Man? New Brain Research Has the Answer | journal = Music Educators Journal | volume = 63 | issue = 9| pages = 30–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Regalski (1977) demonstrated that while listening to the melody of the popular carol "Silent Night", the right hemisphere thinks, "Ah, yes, Silent Night", while the left hemisphere thinks, "two sequences: the first a literal repetition, the second a repetition at different pitch levels—ah, yes, Silent Night by Franz Gruber, typical pastorate folk style." The brain for the most part works well when each hemisphere performs its own function while solving a task or problem; the two hemispheres are quite complementary. However, situations arise when the two modes are in conflict, resulting in one hemisphere interfering with the operation of the other hemisphere.&lt;ref name="regalski1977" /&gt;

==Testing==

===Absolute pitch===
[[Absolute pitch]] (AP) is the ability to produce or recognize specific pitches without reference to an external standard.&lt;ref name="Levitin"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03206733 | author = Levitin D. J. | year = 1994 | title = Absolute memory for musical pitch: Evidence from the production of learned melodies | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 414–423 | pmid=7984397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-494"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch In D. Deutsch (Ed.) | journal=The psychology of music, 3rd Edition | volume= | pages=141–182 | year=2013 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381460-9.00005-5 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/PsyMus_3_Ch5_Absolute_Pitch.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; People boasting AP have internalized pitch references, and thus are able to maintain stable representations of pitch in long-term memory. AP is regarded as a rare and somewhat mysterious ability, occurring in as few as 1 in 10,000 people. A method commonly used to test for AP is as follows: subjects are first asked to close their eyes and imagine that a specific song is playing in their heads. Encouraged to start anywhere in the tune they like, subjects are then instructed to try to reproduce the tones of that song by singing, humming, or whistling. Productions made by the subject are then recorded on digital audio tape, which accurately preserves the pitches they sing avoiding the potential pitch and speed fluctuations of analog recording. Lastly, the subjects' productions are compared to the actual tones sung by the artists on the CDs. Errors are measured in semitone deviations from the correct pitch.&lt;ref name= "Levitin"/&gt; This test, however, does not determine whether or not the subject has true absolute pitch, but rather is a test of implicit absolute pitch. Where true absolute pitch is concerned, Deutsch and colleagues have shown that music conservatory students who are speakers of tone languages  have a far higher prevalence of absolute pitch than do speakers of nontone languages such as English.&lt;ref name="phil-388"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D., Dooley, K., Henthorn, T. and Head, B. | title=Absolute pitch among students in an American music conservatory: Association with tone language fluency | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=125 | issue=4 | pages=2398–2403 | year=2009 | doi=10.1121/1.3081389 | pmid=19354413|bibcode = 2009ASAJ..125.2398D }} [http://scitation.aip.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=ASADL&amp;smode=strresults&amp;sort=rel&amp;maxdisp=25&amp;threshold=0&amp;pjournals=ARLOFJ%2CJASMAN%2CNOCOAN%2CSOUCAU%2CPMARCW%2CATCODK%2CASASTR&amp;possible1=Absolute+pitch+among+students+in+an+American+music+conservatory&amp;possible1zone=article&amp;OUTLOG=NO&amp;viewabs=JASMAN&amp;key=DISPLAY&amp;docID=2&amp;page=0&amp;chapter=0 Weblink] [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2009_125_2398-2403.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-43"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D., Henthorn, T., Marvin, E., &amp; Xu H-S | title=Absolute pitch among American and Chinese conservatory students: Prevalence differences, and evidence for a speech-related critical period. | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=119 | issue=2 | pages=719–722 | year=2006 | doi=10.1121/1.2151799 | pmid=16521731|bibcode = 2006ASAJ..119..719D }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2006_119_719-722.pdf PDF Document]

===Testing===
The ability to recognize incorrect pitch (musical) is most often tested by using the Distorted Tunes Test (DTT). The DTT was originally developed in the 1940s and was used in large studies in the British population. The DTT measures musical pitch recognition ability on an ordinal scale, scored as the number of correctly classified tunes. More specifically the DTT is used to evaluate subjects on how well they judge whether simple popular melodies contain notes with incorrect pitch. Researchers have used this method to investigate genetic correlates of musical pitch recognition in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Drayna D. |author2=Manichaikul A. |author3=Lange M. |author4=Snieder H. |author5=Spector T. | year = 2001 | title = Genetic correlates of musical pitch recognition in humans | url = | journal = Science | volume = 291 | issue = 5510| pages = 1969–1972 | pmid = 11239158 | doi = 10.1126/science.291.5510.1969 | bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1969D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drayna, Manichaikul, Lange, Snieder and Spector (2001) determined that the variation in musical pitch recognition is primarily due to highly heritable differences in auditory functions not tested by conventional audiologic methods. Therefore, the DTT method may provide a benefit to advancing research studies similar to this one.

===In infants===
The following testing procedure has been used to assess infants' ability to recall familiar, yet complex pieces of music,&lt;ref name="Ilari" /&gt; and also their preference for timbre and tempo.&lt;ref name="trainor"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2004.00348.x |author1=Trainor L.J. |author2=Wu L. |author3=Tsang C.D. | year = 2004 | title = Long-term memory for music: infants remember tempo and timbre | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 289–296 | pmid = 15595370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following procedure has demonstrated not only that infants attend longer to familiar than to unfamiliar pieces of music but also that infants remember the tempo and timbre of the familiarized melodies over long periods of time. This has been demonstrated by the fact that by changing the tempo or timbre at test, one eliminates an infant's preference for the novel melody. Thus, indicating that infants' long-term memory representations are not simply of the abstract musical structure, but contain surface or performance features as well. This testing procedure contains three phases:
#Familiarization: The selected musical piece is given to parents/caretakers on a CD. Parents and caretakers are instructed to listen to the musical piece three times a day, when the infant is in a quiet and alert state and the home environment is calm and peaceful.
#Retention: CDs are collected from the parents/caretakers immediately after the familiarization phase to ensure that no listening of the familiar piece occurs during the two-week retention phase.
#Test: Finally, infants are tested in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a behavioral data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap of his or her mother. A light is located on either side of the infant. The trial begins when the infant is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.&lt;ref name="Ilari"&gt;Ilari, B. S. (July 2002).

==Lyrical vs. instrumental memory==
Many students listen to music while they study. Many of these students maintain that the reasons why they listen to music are to prevent drowsiness and to maintain their arousal for study. Some even believe that background music facilitates better work performance.&lt;ref name="Iwanaga"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iwanaga M. |author2=Ito T. | year = 2002 | title = Disturbance effect of music on processing of verbal and spatial memories | url = | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 94 | issue = 3 Pt 2| pages = 1251–1258 | pmid = 12186247 | doi=10.2466/pms.2002.94.3c.1251}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Salame and Baddeley (1989) showed that both vocal and instrumental music interfered with performance of linguistic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Salame P. |author2=Baddeley A. D. | year = 1989 | title = Effects of background music on phonological short-term memory | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 41A | issue = 4| pages = 107–122 |doi = 10.1080/14640748908402355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They explained that disturbance in performance was caused by task-irrelevant phonological information using resources in the working memory system.&lt;ref name="Iwanaga" /&gt; This disturbance can be explained by the fact that the linguistic component of music can occupy the phonological loop, similar to the way speech does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03196503 |vauthors=Hanley JR, Bakopoulou E | year = 2003 | title = Irrelevant speech, articulatory suppression, and phonological similarity: A test of the phonological loop model and the feature model | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 435–444 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is further demonstrated by the fact that vocal music has been perceived to interfere more with memory than instrumental music and nature sound music.&lt;ref name= "Iwanaga"/&gt; Rolla (1993) explains that lyrics, being language, develop images that allow for the interpretation of experience in the communicative process.&lt;ref name="Rolla"&gt;Rolla, G. M. (1993) Your inner music: Creative Analysis and Music Memory. Workbook/Journal. Chiron Publications. Wilmette, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt; Current research coincides with this idea and maintains that the sharing of experience by language in song may communicate feeling and mood much more directly than either language itself or instrumental music alone. Vocal music also affects emotion and mood much more swiftly than instrumental music.&lt;ref name="Rolla"/&gt; However, Fogelson (1973) reported instrumental music interfered with children's performance on a reading comprehension test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fogelson S | year = 1973 | title = Music as a distractor on reading-test performance of eighth grade students | url = | journal = Perceptual &amp; Motor Skills | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 1265–1266 | doi=10.2466/pms.1973.36.3c.1265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Neural structures form and become more sophisticated as a result of experience. For example, the preference for consonance, the harmony or agreement of components, over dissonance, an unstable tone combination, is found early in development. Research suggests that this is due to both the experiencing of structured sounds and the fact they stem from development of the basilar membrane and auditory nerve, two early developing structures in the brain.&lt;ref name="Hannon"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hannon Erin E. |author2=Trainor Laurel J. | year = 2007 | title = Music acquisition: effects of enculturation and formal training on development | url =http://www.stefan-koelsch.de/papers4guidel/Hannon+_TICS2007_music-acquisition-training-enculturation-development.pdf | format=PDF | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 11 | issue = 11| pages = 466–472 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2007.08.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An incoming auditory stimulus evokes responses measured in the form of an [[Event-related potential]] (ERP), measured brain responses resulting directly from a thought or perception. There is a difference in ERP measures for normally developing infants ranging from 2–6 months in age. Measures in infants 4 months and older demonstrate faster, more negative ERPs. In contrast, newborns and infants up to 4 months of age show slow, unsynchronized, positive ERPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0167-8760(03)00148-X |vauthors=Trainor L, McFadden M, Hodgson L, Darragh L, Barlow J, Matsos L, Sonnadara R | year = 2003 | title = Changes in auditory cortex and the development of mismatch negativity between 2 and 6 months of age | url = | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 5–15 | pmid = 14629918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trainor, et al. (2003) hypothesized that these results indicated that responses from infants less than four months of age are produced by subcortical auditory structures, whereas with older infants responses tend to originate in the higher cortical structures.

===Relative and absolute pitch===
There are two methods of encoding/remembering music. The first process is known as ''relative pitch'', which refers to a person's ability to identify the intervals between given tones. Therefore, the song is learned as a continuous succession of intervals. Some people can also use ''absolute pitch'' in the process; this is ability to name or replicate a tone without reference to an external standard. Relative pitch has also been credited by some with being the more sophisticated of the two processes as it allows for quick recognition regardless of pitch, timbre or quality, as well as having the ability to produce physiological responses, for example, if the melody violates the learned relative pitch.&lt;ref name="Hannon"/&gt; Relative pitch has been shown to develop at varying rates dependent on culture. Trehub and Schellenberg (2008) found that 5- and 6-year-old Japanese children performed significantly better at a task requiring the utilization of relative pitch than same-aged Canadian children. They hypothesized that this could be because the Japanese children have more exposure to pitch accent via Japanese language and culture than the predominantly stressed environment Canadian children experience.

===Plasticity of musical development===
Early acquisition of relative pitch allows for accelerated learning of scales and intervals. Musical training assists with the attentional and executive functioning necessary to interpret and efficiently encode music. In conjunction with [[neuroplasticity|brain plasticity]], these processes become more and more stable. However, this process expresses a degree of [[circular logic]] in that the more learning that takes place, the greater the stability of the processes, ultimately decreasing overall brain plasticity.&lt;ref name="Hannon"/&gt; This could possibly explain the discrepancy in amount of effort both children and adults have to put into mastering new tasks.

==Models==

===Modal model===
Atkinson and Shiffrin's 1968 model consists of separate components for short and long term memory storage. It states that short-term memory is limited by its capacity and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Atkinson R. C. |author2=Shiffrin R. M. |year=1968 |title= Human Memory: A proposed system and its control processes | url=http://www.rca.ucsd.edu/selected_papers/2_Human%20memory_A%20proposed%20system%20and%20its%20control%20processes.pdf | format=PDF | journal=Psychology of learning and motivation | volume=2 | pages=89–195 | doi = 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60422-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that musical short-term memory is stored differently from verbal short-term memory. Berz (1995) found dissimilar results for the correlation between modality and recency effects in language versus music, suggesting that different encoding processes are engaged.&lt;ref name="Berz"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berz W. L. | year = 1995 | title = Working Memory in Music; A Theoretical Model | doi = 10.2307/40286188 | journal = Music Perception | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 353–364 | jstor=40286188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berz also demonstrated different levels of interference on tasks as a result of language stimulus vs. musical stimulus. Finally Berz provided evidence for a separate store theory through the "Unattended Music Effect", stating "If there was a singular acoustic store, unattended instrumental music would cause the same disruptions on verbal performance as would unattended vocal music or unattended vocal speech; this, however, [is] not the case".&lt;ref name="Berz"/&gt;

===Baddeley and Hitch's model of working memory===
Baddeley and Hitch's 1974 Model consists of three components; one main component, the [[central executive]] and two sub components, the [[phonological loop]] and the [[visuospatial sketchpad]].&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A. (1990) Human Memory: Theory and practice, Boston: Allyn and Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; The central executive's primary role is to mediate between the two sub-systems. The visuospatial sketchpad holds information about what we see. The phonological loop can be further divided into: the Articulatory control system, the "inner voice" responsible for verbal rehearsal; and the Phonological store, the "inner ear" responsible for speech-based storage. Major criticisms of this model include a lack of musical processing/encoding and an ignorance towards other sensory inputs regarding the encoding and storage of olfactory, gustatory, and tactile inputs.&lt;ref name="Berz"/&gt;

===Theoretical model of memory===
This theoretical model proposed by William Berz (1995) is based on the Baddeley and Hitch model.&lt;ref name="Berz"/&gt; However, Berz modified the model to include a musical memory loop as a loose addition (meaning, almost a separate loop altogether) to the phonological loop. This new musical perceptual loop contains musical inner speech in addition to the verbal inner speech provided by the original phonological loop. He also proposed another loop to include other sensory inputs that were disregarded in the Baddeley and Hitch model.&lt;ref name="Berz"/&gt;

===Koelsch's model===
In a model outlined by Stefan Koelsch and Walter Siebel, music stimuli are perceived in a successive timeline, breaking down the auditory input into different characteristics and meaning. He maintained that upon perception the sound reaches the auditory nerve, brainstem and thalamus. At this point features involving pitch height, chroma, timbre, intensity and roughness are extracted. This occurs about at about 10–100[[millisecond|ms]]. Next, melodic and rhythmic grouping occurs, which is then perceived by auditory sensory memory. After this, an analysis is made of intervals and chord progressions. A harmony is then built upon the structure of metre, rhythm and timbre. This occurs from about 180–400ms after the initial perception. Following this, structural reanalysis and repair occur, at about 600–900ms. Finally, the autonomic nervous system and multimodal association cortices are activated. Koelsch and Siebel proposed that from about 250–500ms, based on the sound's meaning, interpretation and emotion occurs continuously throughout this process. This is indicated by [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]], a negative spike at 400ms, as measured by an "event related potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koelsch S. |author2=Siebel W.

'''New Age''' is a term applied to a range of [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices that developed in [[Western culture|Western nations]] during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the New Age differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly [[eclecticism|eclectic]] structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of '''spiritual''' or '''Mind, Body, Spirit''' and rarely use the term "New Age" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the '''New Age movement''', although others contest this term and suggest that it is better seen as a [[milieu]] or [[zeitgeist]].

&lt;!--History of the New Age--&gt;
As a form of [[Western esotericism]], the New Age drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[Franz Mesmer]], as well as the ideas of [[Spiritualism]], [[New Thought]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the [[UFO religions]] of the 1950s, the [[Counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[Human Potential Movement]], also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age. The exact origins of the phenomenon remain contested, but there is general agreement that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term "New Age" was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended.  

&lt;!--Core Beliefs--&gt;
Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age have been identified. [[Theology|Theologically]], the New Age typically adopts a belief in a [[Holism|holistic]] form of divinity that imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as [[angel]]s and [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|masters]], with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeling]]. Typically viewing human history as being divided into a series of distinct ages, a common New Age belief is that whereas once humanity lived in an age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, it has entered a period of spiritual degeneracy, which will be remedied through the establishment of a coming [[Age of Aquarius]], from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of [[alternative medicine]], and an emphasis on a New Age "science" that seeks to unite science and spirituality.

&lt;!--Sociological factors--&gt;
Centred primarily in Western countries, those involved in the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous communities]]. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of [[religious studies]].

==Definitions==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="One of the few things on which all scholars agree concerning New Age is that it is difficult to define. Often, the definition given actually reflects the background of the scholar giving the definition. Thus, the New Ager views New Age as a revolutionary period of history dictated by the stars; the Christian apologist has often defined new age as a cult; the historian of ideas understands it as a manifestation of the perennial tradition; the philosopher sees New Age as a monistic or holistic worldview; the sociologist describes New Age as a new religious movement (NRM); while the psychologist describes it as a form of narcissism."|source=— Scholar of religion Daren Kemp, 2004.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} }}

The New Age phenomenon has proved difficult to define,{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1p=363|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=1|3a1=Granholm|3y=2013|3p=59}} with much scholarly disagreement as to its scope.{{sfn|Granholm|2013|p=59}} The scholars Steven J. Sutcliffe and Ingvild Sælid Gilhus have even suggested that it remains "among the most disputed of categories in the study of religion".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=1}}

The scholar of religion [[Paul Heelas]] characterised the New Age as "...an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life" that can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of "...the same (or very similar) ''[[lingua franca]]'' to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be [[Spiritual transformation| transformed]]."{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=1–2}} Similarly, the historian of religion [[Olav Hammer]] termed it "a common denominator for a variety of quite divergent contemporary popular practices and beliefs" that have emerged since the late 1970s and are "largely united by historical links, a shared discourse and an ''air de famille''".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} According to Hammer, this New Age was a "fluid and fuzzy [[cult]]ic milieu".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=14}} The [[Sociology of religion|sociologist of religion]] [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] described the New Age as "...an umbrella term that includes a great variety of groups and identities" that are united by their "...expectation of a major and universal change being primarily founded on the individual and collective development of human potential."{{sfn|York|1995|pp=1–2}}

The scholar of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] adopted a different approach by asserting that "New Age" was "a ''label'' attached indiscriminately to whatever seems to fit it" and that as a result it "means very different things to different people".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=1}} He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered "a unified ideology or ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]''",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}} although he believed that it could be considered a "more or less unified 'movement'."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} Conversely, various other scholars have suggested that the New Age is insufficiently homogenous to be regarded as a singular ''movement''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bruce|1y=1998|1p=24|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=9|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=22}} As a replacement term, the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was better seen as a [[milieu]],{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=24}} while scholar of religion [[George D. Chryssides]] suggested that it could be understood as "a counter-cultural ''Zeitgeist''".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=22}}

There is no central authority within the New Age phenomenon that can determine what counts as New Age and what does not.{{sfn|York|2001|p=364}}
Many of those groups and individuals who could analytically be categorised as part of the New Age reject the term "New Age" in reference to themselves.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1pp=1–2|2a1= Heelas|2y=1996|2p=17|3a1=York|3y=2001|3p=364|4a1= Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=200|5a1=Partridge|5y=2004|5p=2|6a1=MacKian|6y=2012|6p=5}} Some even express active hostility to the term.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=177}} Rather than terming themselves "New Agers", those involved in this milieu commonly describe themselves as spiritual "seekers",{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}} and some self-identify as a member of a different religious group, such as Christianity, Judaism, or Buddhism.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=25}} In 2003 Sutcliffe observed that the use of the term "New Age" was "optional, episodic and declining overall", adding that among the very few individuals who did use it, they usually did so with qualification, for instance by placing it in quotation marks.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=197}} Other academics, such as Sara MacKian, have argued that the sheer diversity of the New Age renders the term too problematic for scholars to use.{{sfnm|1a1=Chryssides|1y=2007|1p=10|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=7}} MacKian proposed "everyday spirituality" as an alternate term.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=12}}

While acknowledging that "New Age" was a problematic term, the scholar of religion  [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] stated that it remained a useful [[etic]] category for scholars to use because, "There exists no comparable term which covers all aspects of the movement."{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Similarly, Chryssides argued that the fact that "New Age" is a "theoretical concept" does not "undermine its usefulness or employability"; he drew comparisons with "[[Hinduism]]", a similar "western etic piece of vocabulary" that scholars of religion used despite its problems.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=13}}

===Religion, spirituality, and esotericism===

In discussing the New Age, academics have varyingly referred to "New Age spirituality" and "New Age religion".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} Those involved in the New Age rarely consider it to be "religion"—negatively associating that term solely with [[organized religion]]—and instead describe their practices as "spirituality".{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1pp=214–215|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=48}} Religious studies scholars, however, have repeatedly referred to the New Age milieu as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=243|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=38}} York described the New Age as a [[new religious movement]] (NRM).{{sfn|York|1995|p=2}} Conversely, both Heelas and Sutcliffe rejected this categorisation;{{sfnm|1a1= Heelas|1y=1996|1p=9|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=200}} Heelas believed that while elements of the New Age represented NRMs, this did not apply to every New Age group.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=9}} Similarly, Chryssides stated that the New Age could not be seen as "a religion" in itself.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=19}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="The New Age movement is the cultic milieu having become conscious of itself, in the later 1970s, as constituting a more or less unified "movement". All manifestations of this movement are characterized by a popular western culture criticism expressed in terms of a secularized esotericism."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff, 1996.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} }}

The New Age is also a form of [[Western esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=33|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=400|3a1=Hammer|3y=2001|3p=9}} Hanegraaff regarded the New Age as a form of "popular culture criticism", in that it represented a reaction against the dominant Western values of [[Judeo-Christian]] religion and rationalism,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=331}} adding that "New Age religion formulates such criticism not at random, but falls back on" the ideas of earlier Western esoteric groups.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}}

The New Age has also been identified by various scholars of religion as part of the [[cultic milieu]].{{sfnm|1a1= Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=522|2a1= Hammer|2y=2001|2p=28|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=17}} This concept, developed by the sociologist [[Colin Campbell (sociologist)|Colin Campbell]], refers to a social network of marginalised ideas. Through their shared marginalisation within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=28–29}}

Hammer identified much of the New Age as corresponding to the concept of "[[folk religions]]" in that it seeks to deal with [[existential]] questions regarding subjects like death and disease in "an unsystematic fashion, often through a process of [[bricolage]] from already available narratives and rituals".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} York also heuristically divides the New Age into three broad trends. The first, the ''social camp'', represents groups that primarily seek to bring about social change, while the second, the ''occult camp'', instead focus on contact with spirit entities and channeling. York's third group, the ''spiritual camp'', represents a middle ground between these two camps that focuses largely on [[self-development | individual development]].{{sfn|York|1995|pp=36–37}}

===Terminology===

The term ''new age'', along with related terms like ''new era'' and ''new world'', long predate the emergence of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better way of life for humanity is dawning.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the [[Great Seal of the United States]], designed in 1782, proclaims a "new order of ages", while in the 1980s the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] proclaimed that "all mankind is entering a new age".{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=25}}  In 1864 the American [[Swedenborgian]] [[Warren Felt Evans]] published ''The New Age and its Message'', while in 1907 [[Alfred Orage]] and [[Holbrook Jackson]] began editing a weekly journal of [[Liberal Christianity|Christian liberalism]] and [[socialism]] titled ''[[The New Age]]''.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=17}} The concept of a coming "new age" that would be inaugurated by the [[Second Coming | return to Earth]] of [[Jesus Christ]] was a theme in the poetry of [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]] and [[Johanna Brandt]],{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}} and then also appeared in the work of the American Theosophist [[Alice Bailey]], who used the term prominently in such titles as ''Disciplineship in the New Age'' (1944) and ''Education in the New Age'' (1954).{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}}

Between the 1930s and 1960s a small number of groups and individuals became preoccupied with the concept of a coming "New Age" and prominently used the term accordingly.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=55}} The term had thus become a recurring motif in the esoteric spirituality milieu.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=99}}
Sutcliffe therefore expressed the view that while the term "New Age" had originally been an "apocalyptic emblem", it would only be later that it became "a tag or codeword for a 'spiritual' idiom".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=29}}

==History==

===Antecedents===
{{double image|right|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.jpg|141|CGJung.jpg|140|Prominent esoteric thinkers who influenced the New Age include [[Helena Blavatsky]] (left) and [[Carl Jung]] (right)}}

According to scholar [[Nevill Drury]], the New Age has a "tangible history",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} although Hanegraaff expressed the view that most New Agers were "surprisingly ignorant about the actual historical roots of their beliefs".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=323}} Similarly, Hammer thought that "source amnesia" was a "building block of a New Age worldview", with New Agers typically adopting ideas with no awareness of where those ideas originated.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=180}}

As a form of Western esotericism,{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}} the New Age has antecedents that stretch back to southern Europe in [[Late Antiquity]].{{sfn|Ellwood|1992|p=59}} Following the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed in response to the development of scientific rationality. Scholars call this new esoteric trend ''[[occultism]]'', and this occultism was a key factor in the development of the worldview from which the New Age emerged.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=406–407}}

One of the earliest influences on the New Age was the Swedish 18th century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who professed the ability to communicate with angels, demons, and spirits. Swedenborg's attempt to unite science and religion and his prediction of a coming era in particular have been cited as ways that he prefigured the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=424–429|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=42}} Another early influence was the late 18th and early 19th century German physician and [[hypnotist]] [[Franz Mesmer]], who claimed the existence of a force known as "[[animal magnetism]]" running through the human body.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=430–435|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=41}} The establishment of [[Spiritualism]], an occult religion influenced by both Swedenborgianism and Mesmerism, in the U.S. during the 1840s has also been identified as a precursor to the New Age, in particular through its rejection of established Christianity, its claims to representing a scientific approach to religion, and its emphasis on channeling spirit entities.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=435|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=24|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=37}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="Most of the beliefs which characterise the New Age were already present by the end of the 19th century, even to such an extent that one may legitimately wonder whether the New Age brings anything new at all."|source=— Historian of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]], 1996.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=482–483}} }}

A further major influence on the New Age was the [[Theosophical Society]], an occult group co-founded by the Russian [[Helena Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. In her books ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877) and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), Blavatsky claimed that her Society was conveying the essence of all world religions, and it thus emphasized a focus on [[comparative religion]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=448–455|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24|4a1=Kemp|4y=2004|4p=39}} Serving as a partial bridge between Theosophical ideas and those of the New Age was the American esotericist [[Edgar Cayce]], who founded the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=60|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2p=66}} Another influence was [[New Thought]], which developed in late nineteenth century [[New England]] as a Christian-oriented healing movement before spreading throughout the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=35|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=455–462|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=38}} Another prominent influence was the psychologist [[Carl Jung]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=46–47|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=69–70}} 
Drury also identified as an important influence upon the New Age the Indian [[Swami Vivekananda]], an adherent of the philosophy of [[Vedanta]] who first brought Hinduism to the West in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Drury|2004|pp=27–28}}

Hanegraaff believed that the New Age's direct antecedents could be found in the [[UFO religion]]s of the 1950s, which he termed a "proto-New Age movement".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=95–96}} Many of these new religious movements had strong apocalyptic beliefs regarding a coming new age, which they typically asserted would be brought about by contact with extraterrestrials.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=95–96|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=72}} Examples of such groups included the [[Aetherius Society]], founded in the UK in 1955, and the [[Heralds of the New Age]], established in New Zealand in 1956.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=72, 74}}

[[File:Barrel House.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Wooden barrel house in forest with surrounding footpaths|This barrel house was the first dwelling constructed at the [[Findhorn Ecovillage]].]]

=== 1960s ===
From a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is rooted in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=11|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=15}} Although not common throughout the counterculture, usage of the terms "New Age" and "Age of Aquarius" – used in reference to a coming era – were found within it,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=108–109}} for instance appearing on adverts for the [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=109}} and in the lyrics of "[[Aquarius (song)|Aquarius]]", the opening song of the 1967 musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=10|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=109|3a1=Sutcliffe|3a2=Gilhus|3y=2013|3p=4}}
This decade also witnessed the emergence of a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the [[San Francisco Zen Center]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], [[Soka Gakkai]], the [[Inner Peace Movement]], the [[Church of All Worlds]], and the [[Church of Satan]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=53–54}} Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century,{{sfn|Brown|1992|pp=88–89}} many of these new developments were variants of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sufism]], which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the [[Asian Exclusion Act]] in 1965.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=54–55}} In 1962 the [[Esalen Institute]] was established in [[Big Sur]], [[California]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36–37|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51}} Esalen and similar personal growth centers had developed links to [[humanistic psychology]], and from this, the [[human potential movement]] emerged, strongly influenced the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36, 41–43|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=8|3a1=Heelas|3y=1996|3p=53}}

In Britain, a number of small religious groups that came to be identified as the "light" movement had begun declaring the existence of a coming new age, influenced strongly by the Theosophical ideas of Blavatsky and Bailey.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=20}} The most prominent of these groups was the [[Findhorn Foundation]], which founded the Findhorn Ecovillage in the Scottish area of [[Findhorn]], [[Moray]] in 1962.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51|5a1=Chryssides|5y=2007|5p=8}} Although its founders were from an older generation, Findhorn attracted increasing numbers of countercultural baby boomers during the 1960s, to the extent that its population had grown sixfold to circa 120 residents by 1972.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=118}} In October 1965, the founder of Findhorn, [[Peter Caddy]], attended a meeting of various prominent figures within Britain's esoteric milieu; titled "The Significance of the Group in the New Age", it was held at [[Attingham Park]] over the course of a weekend.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=83–84}}

All of these groups created the backdrop from which the New Age movement emerged. As James R. Lewis and [[J. Gordon Melton]] point out, the New Age phenomenon represents "a synthesis of many different preexisting movements and strands of thought".{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}} Nevertheless, York asserted that while the New Age bore many similarities with both earlier forms of Western esotericism and Asian religion, it remained "distinct from its predecessors in its own self-consciousness as a new way of thinking".{{sfn|York|1995|p=1}}

===Emergence and development: c. 1970–2000===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The late 1950s saw the first stirrings within the cultic milieu of a belief in a coming new age. A variety of small movements arose, revolving around revealed messages from beings in space and presenting a synthesis of post-Theosophical and other esoteric doctrines. These movements might have remained marginal, had it not been for the explosion of the counterculture in the 1960s and early 1970s. Various historical threads... began to converge: nineteenth century doctrinal elements such as Theosophy and post-Theosophical esotericism as well as harmonious or positive thinking were now eclectically combined with... religious psychologies: transpersonal psychology, Jungianism and a variety of Eastern teachings. It became perfectly feasible for the same individuals to consult the I Ching, practice Jungian astrology, read Abraham Maslow's writings on peak experiences, etc. The reason for the ready incorporation of such disparate sources was a similar goal of exploring an individualized and largely non-Christian religiosity."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Olav Hammer, 2001.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} }}

By the early 1970s, use of the term "New Age" was increasingly common within the cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} This was because—according to Sutcliffe—the "emblem" of the "New Age" had been passed from the "subcultural pioneers" in groups like Findhorn to the wider array of "countercultural baby boomers" between ''circa'' 1967 and 1974. He noted that as this happened, the meaning of the term "New Age" changed; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era, at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of spiritual activities and practices.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=112}} In the latter part of the 1970s, the New Age expanded to cover a wide variety of alternative spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, not all of which explicitly held to the belief in the Age of Aquarius, but were nevertheless widely recognised as broadly similar in their search for "alternatives" to mainstream society.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} In doing so, the "New Age" became a banner under which to bring together the wider "cultic milieu" of American society.{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}}

The counterculture of the 1960s had rapidly declined by the start of the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the [[commune]] movement,{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=54}} but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and [[hippie]] subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}}
The exact origins of the New Age movement remain an issue of debate; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s,{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=18}} whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s, adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=12}} This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from Theosophy and [[Anthroposophy]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the ''New Age sensu stricto'', or "New Age in the strict sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}}

Hanegraaff terms the broader development the ''New Age sensu lato'', or "New Age in the wider sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}} Stores that came to be known as "New Age shops" opened up, selling related books, magazines, jewellery, and crystals, and they were typified by the playing of New Age music and the smell of incense.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=126–127}}This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as "New Age bookstores",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fifty Years Among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms, 1941–1991|first1=John|last1=Algeo|first2=Adele S. |last2=Algeo|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=234|isbn=978-0-521-44971-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while New Age titles came to be increasingly available from mainstream bookstores and then websites like [[Amazon.com]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}}

Not everyone who came to be associated with the New Age phenomenon openly embraced the term "New Age", although it was popularised in books like [[David Spangler]]'s 1977 work ''Revelation: The Birth of a New Age'' and [[Mark Satin]]'s 1979 book ''New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society''.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=124}} [[Marilyn Ferguson]]'s 1982 book ''[[The Aquarian Conspiracy]]'' has also been regarded as a landmark work in the development of the New Age, promoting the idea that a new era was emerging.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=9}} Other terms that were employed synonymously with "New Age" in this milieu included "Green", "Holistic", "Alternative", and "Spiritual".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=128}}

1971 witnessed the foundation of [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] by [[Werner H. Erhard]], a transformational training course that became a prominent part of the early movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=58–60}} Melton suggested that the 1970s witnessed the growth of a relationship between the New Age movement and the older New Thought movement, as evidenced by the widespread use of [[Helen Schucman]]'s ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' (1975), New Age music, and crystal healing in New Thought churches.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=25–26}} Some figures in the New Thought movement were sceptical, challenging the compatibility of New Age and New Thought perspectives.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=26–27}} During these decades, Findhorn had become a site of [[pilgrimage]] for many New Agers, and greatly expanded in size as people joined the community, with workshops and conferences being held there that brought together New Age thinkers from across the world.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=29}}

[[File:New Age Shrine Glastonbury - geograph.org.uk - 167848.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A new age shrine. |New Age shrine in [[Glastonbury]], England]]

Several key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: publication of [[Linda Goodman]]'s best-selling astrology books ''Sun Signs'' (1968) and ''Love Signs'' (1978); the release of [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s book ''[[Out on a Limb (Shirley MacLaine book)|Out on a Limb]]'' (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the "[[Harmonic Convergence]]" [[planetary alignment]] on August 16 and 17, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[José Argüelles]] in [[Sedona, Arizona]]. The Convergence attracted more people to the movement than any other single event.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=ix}} Heelas suggested that the movement was influenced by the "enterprise culture" encouraged by the U.S. and U.K. governments during the 1980s onward, with its emphasis on initiative and self-reliance resonating with any New Age ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=168}}

The claims of channelers [[Jane Roberts]] ([[Seth Material]]), Helen Schucman (''[[A Course in Miracles]]''), [[J. Z. Knight]] ([[Ramtha]]), [[Neale Donald Walsch]] (''[[Conversations with God]]'') (note that Walsch denies being a "channeler" and his books make it obvious that he is not one, though the text emerged through a dialogue with a deeper part of himself in a process comparable to [[automatic writing]]) contributed to the movement's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=133–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant exponent of the New Age movement in the U.S. has been cited as [[Ram Dass]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kyle|1y=1995|1pp=66–67|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35}} Core works in the propagating New Age ideas included Jane Roberts's Seth series, published from 1972 onward,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Helen Schucman's 1975 publication ''A Course in Miracles'',{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1pp=35–36|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} and [[James Redfield]]'s 1993 work ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1p=127|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} A variety of these books were [[best seller]]s, with the Seth book series for instance selling over a million copies.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Supplementing these books were videos, audiotapes, compact discs and websites.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=17}} The development of the internet in particular further popularized New Age ideas and made them more widely accessible.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}}

New Age ideas influenced the development of [[rave]] culture in the late 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=168}} In Britain during the 1980s, the term "[[New Age Travellers]]" came into use,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}} although York characterised this term as "a misnomer created by the media".{{sfn|York|2001|p=370}} These New Age Travellers had little to do with the New Age as the term was used more widely,{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=8}} with scholar of religion Daren Kemp observing that "New Age spirituality is not an essential part of New Age Traveller culture, although there are similarities between the two worldviews".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=34}} The term "New Age" came to be used increasingly widely by the popular media in the 1990s.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}}

===Decline or transformation?: 1990–present===

By the late 1980s, some publishers dropped the term "New Age" as a marketing device.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=35}} In 1994, the scholar of religion [[Gordon J. Melton]] presented a conference paper in which he argued that, given that he knew of nobody describing their practices as "New Age" anymore, the New Age had died.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=178}} In 2001, Hammer observed that the term "New Age" had increasingly been rejected as either pejorative or meaningless by individuals within the Western cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}} He also noted that within this milieu it was not being replaced by any alternative, and that as such a sense of collective identity was being lost.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}}

Other scholars disagreed with Melton's idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that "New Age is still very much alive".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=179}} Hammer himself stated that "the New Age ''movement'' may be on the wane, but the wider New Age ''religiosity''... shows no sign of disappearing".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=75}} MacKian suggested that the New Age "movement" had been replaced by a wider "New Age sentiment" which had come to pervade "the socio-cultural landscape" of Western countries.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=7}} Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high profile figures: U.S. First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] consulted an astrologer, British [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|Märtha Louise]] established a school devoted to communicating with angels.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=146}} 
New Age shops continued to operate, although many have been remarketed as "Mind, Body, Spirit".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=17}} 

In 2015, the scholar of religion [[Hugh Urban]] argued that New Age spirituality is growing in the United States and can be expected to become more visible: "According to many recent surveys of religious affiliation, the 'spiritual but not religious' category is one of the fastest-growing trends in American culture, so the New Age attitude of spiritual individualism and eclecticism may well be an increasingly visible one in the decades to come".{{sfn|Urban|2015|p=11}}

==Beliefs and practices==
{{Main article|Spiritual but not religious|List of New Age topics}}

===Eclecticism and self-spirituality===

The New Age places strong emphasis on the idea that the individual and their own experiences are the primary source of authority on spiritual matters.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=201–202|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=21–23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=26}} It exhibits what Heelas termed "unmediated individualism",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=21–23}} and reflects a world-view that is "radically democratic".{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=124}} It places an emphasis on the freedom and autonomy of the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=26–27|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=119}} This emphasis has led to ethical disagreements; some New Agers believe helping others is beneficial, although another view is that doing so encourages dependency and conflicts with a reliance on the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=25}} Nevertheless, within the New Age, there are differences in the role accorded to voices of authority outside of the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=34}} Hammer stated that "a belief in the existence of a core or true Self" is a "recurring theme" in New Age texts.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=11}} The concept of "[[personal growth]]" is also greatly emphasised among New Agers,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=46|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=188}} while Heelas noted that "for participants spirituality ''is'' life-itself".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=27}}

New Age religiosity is typified by its eclecticism.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=163}} Generally believing that there is no one true way to pursue spirituality,{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=118–119}} New Agers develop their own worldview "by combining bits and pieces to form their own individual mix",{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=28}} seeking what Drury called "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas".{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=8}} The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that "any alternative spiritual path is good because it is spiritual and alternative".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=36}} This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents "supermarket spirituality".{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=32}} York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age's origins within [[late modernity|late modern]] capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} 

As part of its eclecticism, the New Age draws ideas from many different cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to "a very vague claim" about underlying global unity.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=139}} Certain societies are more usually chosen over others;{{sfnm|1a1=Hammer|1y=2001|1p=199|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=49}} examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the [[Essenes]], [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], and ancient extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=47}} As noted by Hammer: "to put it bluntly, no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians are not part of our cultural stereotypes".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=199}} According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic "Other" for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=48}}

===Theology, cosmogony, and cosmology===

[[File:Snoqualmie Moondance meditation 02.jpg|thumb|right|New Age meditation group at the Snoqualmie Moondance festival, 1992]]

A belief in [[divinity]] is integral to New Age ideas, although understandings of this divinity vary.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=182–183}} New Age [[theology]] exhibits an inclusive and universalistic approach that accepts all personal perspectives on the divine as equally valid.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=185}} This intentional vagueness as to the nature of divinity also reflects the New Age idea that divinity cannot be comprehended by the human mind or language.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} New Age literature nevertheless displays recurring traits in its depiction of the divine: the first is the idea that it is [[Holism|holistic]], thus frequently being described with such terms as an "Ocean of Oneness", "Infinite Spirit", "Primal Stream", "One Essence", and "Universal Principle".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} A second trait is the characterisation of divinity as "Mind", "Consciousness", and "Intelligence",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=186–187}} while a third is the description of divinity as a form of "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=187}} A fourth trait is the characterisation of divinity as a "life force", the essence of which is creativity, while a fifth is the concept that divinity consists of [[love]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=187–188}}

Most New Age groups believe in an Ultimate Source from which all things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=120}} Various [[creation myths]] have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=122–123}} In contrast, some New Agers emphasise the idea of a universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=128}} The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=119|2a1=Drury|2y=2004|2p=11}} in doing so rejecting both the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of Judeo-Christian thought and the [[reductionism]] of Cartesian science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=119}} A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=23}} The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as "droplet of divinity", "inner Godhead", and "divine self".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=204}} Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding '[[subtle bodies]]',{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=222–223}} a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a "Higher Self" that is a part of the human but connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through [[intuition]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=211–212}}

Cosmogonical creation stories are common in New Age sources,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=304}} with these accounts reflecting the movement's holistic framework by describing an original, primal oneness from which all things in the universe emanated.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=305}} An additional common theme is that human souls – once living in a spiritual world – then descended into a world of matter.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=307–308}}
The New Age movement typically views the material universe as a meaningful illusion, which humans should try to use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=115}} This physical world is hence seen as "a domain for learning and growth" after which the human soul might pass on to higher levels of existence.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=116–117}} There is thus a widespread belief that reality is engaged in an ongoing process of evolution; rather than [[Darwinian evolution]], this is typically seen as either a teleological evolution which assumes a process headed to a specific goal, or an open-ended, creative evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=158–160}}

===Spirit and channeling===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In the flood of channeled material which has been published or delivered to "live" audiences in the last two decades, there is much indeed that is trivial, contradictory, and confusing. The authors of much of this material make claims that, while not necessarily untrue or fraudulent, are difficult or impossible for the reader to verify. A number of other channeled documents address issues more immediately relevant to the human condition. The best of these writings are not only coherent and plausible, but eloquently persuasive and sometimes disarmingly moving."|source=— Academic Suzanne Riordan, 1992.{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=107}} }}

MacKian argued that a central, but often overlooked, element of the phenomenon was an emphasis on "[[spirit]]", and in particular participants' desire for a relationship with spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=51, 117}} Many practitioners in her UK-focused study described themselves as "workers ''for'' spirit", expressing the desire to help people learn about spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=145}} They understood various material signs as marking the presence of spirit, for instance the unexpected appearance of a feather.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=142–143}} New Agers often call upon this spirit to assist them in everyday situations, for instance to ease the traffic flow on their way to work.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=84, 143}}  

New Age literature often refers to benevolent non-human spirit-beings who are interested in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, [[guardian angel]]s, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=197, 198}} New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=198}} The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=189–190}}

Although not present in every New Age group,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=105}} a core belief within the milieu is in [[mediumship|channeling]].{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24}} This is the idea that humans beings, sometimes (although not always) in a state of [[trance]], can act "as a channel of information from sources other than their normal selves".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} These sources are varyingly described as being [[God]], [[gods]] and [[goddesses]], [[ascended masters]], [[spirit guide]]s, [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], [[angel]]s, [[Deva (New Age)|devas]], historical figures, the [[collective unconscious]], [[elemental]]s, or [[nature spirit]]s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of "articulated revelation",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=24}} and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=27–28}}

Prominent examples of New Age channeling include Jane Roberts' claims that she was contacted by an entity called Seth, and Helen Schucman's claims to have channeled Jesus Christ.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=22|2a1=Riordan|2y=1992|2pp=108–110|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=28}} The academic Suzanne Riordan examined a variety of these New Age channeled messages, noting that they typically "echoed each other in tone and content", offering an analysis of the human condition and giving instructions or advice for how humanity can discover its true destiny.{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=110}}
For many New Agers, these channeled messages rival the scriptures of the main world religions as sources of spiritual authority,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=108}} although often New Agers describe historical religious revelations as forms of "channeling" as well, thus attempting to legitimate and authenticate their own contemporary practices.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=26–27}} Although the concept of channeling from discarnate spirit entities has links to [[Spiritualism]] and [[psychical research]], the New Age does not feature Spiritualism's emphasis on proving the existence of life after death, nor psychical research's focus of testing mediums for consistency.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=23}}

===Astrological cycles and the Age of Aquarius===

New Age thought typically envisions the world as developing through cosmological cycles that can be identified [[astrology|astrologically]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=102, 302}} It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}} New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived in an age of spiritual wisdom.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on [[Lost lands|lost continents]] such as Atlantis, [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], and [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of [[Ancient Egypt]] were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=309–314}}
New Age literature often posits that the ancient period of spiritual wisdom gave way to an age of spiritual decline, sometimes termed the [[Age of Pisces]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} Although characterised as being a negative period for humanity, New Age literature views the Age of Pisces as an important learning experience for the species.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} 
Hanegraaff stated that New Age perceptions of history were "extremely sketchy" in their use of description,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} reflecting little interest in [[historiography]] and conflating history with [[myth]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=324}} He also noted that they were highly [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] in placing [[Western world|Western civilization]] at the centre of historical development.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}}

[[File:Venice ast sm.jpg|thumb|left|Astrological ideas hold a central place in the New Age]]

A common belief among the New Age is that humanity has entered, or is coming to enter, a new period known as the [[Age of Aquarius]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=94}} which Melton has characterised as a "New Age of love, joy, peace, abundance, and harmony[...] the Golden Age heretofore only dreamed about."{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=19}} In accepting this belief in a coming new age, the milieu has been described as "highly positive, celebratory, [and] utopian",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=28}} and has also been cited as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic movement]].{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=24}} Opinions about the nature of the coming Age of Aquarius differ among New Agers.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=333}} There are for instance differences in belief about its commencement; New Age author David Spangler claimed that it began in 1967,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=334–335}} others placed its beginning with the Harmonic Convergence of 1987,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=335}} author José Argüelles predicted its start [[2012 phenomenon|in 2012]],{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=72}} and some believe that it will not begin until several centuries into the third millennium.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=335–336}}

There are also differences in how this new age is envisioned.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=336}} Those adhering to what Hanegraaff termed the "moderate" perspective believed that it would be marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concerns—through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicine—to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=339–340}} Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an "Age of Light", with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=341—343}} Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that it would last for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=102}} 

There are various beliefs within the milieu as to how this new age will come about, but most emphasise the idea that it will be established through [[human agency]]; others assert that it will be established with the aid of non-human forces such as spirits or extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=74}} Ferguson for instance claimed that there was a vanguard of humans known as the "Aquarian conspiracy" who were helping to bring the Age of Aquarius forth through their actions.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=70}} Participants in the New Age typically express the view that their own spiritual actions are helping to bring about the Age of Aquarius,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=19|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=75–76}} with writers like Ferguson and Argüelles presenting themselves as prophets ushering forth this future era.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=73}}

===Healing and alternative medicine===

Another recurring element of New Age is an emphasis on healing and [[alternative medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ellwood|1y=1992|1p=60|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=37|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3p=42|4a1=Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=174}}&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"&gt;Butler, Jenny and Maria Tighe, "Holistic Health and New Age in the British Isles". 415-34 in Kemp, Daren and Lewis, James R., ed. (2007), Handbook of New Age, Boston, Massachusetts, US: Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15355-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The general New Age ethos is that health is the natural state for the human being and that illness is a disruption of that natural balance.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=46–47}} Hence, New Age therapies seek to heal "[[illness]]" as a general concept that includes physical, mental, and spiritual aspects; in doing so it critiques mainstream Western medicine for simply attempting to cure [[disease]], and thus has an affinity with most forms of [[traditional medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Albanese|1y=1992|1pp=81–82|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=42–43|3a1=Sutcliffe|3y=2003a|3p=176}} Its focus of self-spirituality has led to the emphasis of self-healing,{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2pp=176, 178|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=160}} although also present are ideas on healing both others and the Earth itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=160}}

[[File:Siete chakras.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Reiki]] is one of the alternative therapies commonly found in the New Age movement.]]

The healing elements of the movement are difficult to classify given that a variety of terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=48}} However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the [[Human Potential Movement]], which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=48–49}} Hanegraaff described [[transpersonal psychology]] as the "theoretical wing" of this Human Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=50–51}} Closely connected to this is the [[Neoshamanism|shamanic consciousness]] current, which argues that the [[shamanism|shaman]] was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=52}}

Hanegraaff identified the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being [[holistic health]]. This emerged in the 1970s out of the [[free clinic]] movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=53–54}} It emphasises the idea that the human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=54}} A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, with some of the most common including [[acupuncture]], reiki, [[biofeedback]], [[chiropractic]], [[yoga]], [[kinesiology]], [[homeopathy]], [[aromatherapy]] [[iridology]], [[massage]] and other forms of [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], [[meditation]] and [[Visual perception|visualisation]], nutritional therapy, [[psychic healing]], [[herbal medicine]], [[crystal healing|healing using crystals]], metals, music, [[chromotherapy]], and reincarnation therapy.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=37|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=54–55|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=30}} The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age;{{sfn|Albanese|1992|p=79}} this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=162}}
The mainstreaming of the Holistic Health movement in the UK is discussed by Maria Tighe. The inter-relation of holistic health with the New Age movement is illustrated in Jenny Butler's ethnographic description of "Angel therapy" in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"/&gt;

==="New Age science"===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The New Age is essentially about the search for spiritual and philosophical perspectives that will help transform humanity and the world. New Agers are willing to absorb wisdom teachings wherever they can find them, whether from an Indian guru, a renegade Christian priest, an itinerant Buddhist monk, an experiential psychotherapist or a Native American shaman. They are eager to explore their own inner potential with a view to becoming part of a broader process of social transformation. Their journey is towards totality of being."|source=— New Ager [[Nevill Drury]], 2004.{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=11}} }}

According to Drury, the New Age attempts to create "a worldview that includes both science and spirituality",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} while Hess noted how New Agers have "a penchant for bringing together the technical and the spiritual, the scientific and the religious".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=4}}
Although New Agers typically reject [[rationalism]], the [[scientific method]], and the academic establishment, they employ terminology and concepts borrowed from science and particularly from the [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|New Physics]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} Moreover, a number of prominent influences on New Age, such as [[David Bohm]] and [[Ilya Prigogine]], had backgrounds as professional scientists.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Hanegraaff identified "New Age science" as a form of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=64}} 

In this, the milieu is interested in developing unified world views to discover the nature of the divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Figures in the New Age movement—most notably [[Fritjof Capra]] in his ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of [[mysticism]], thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=128–129}} Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=155–156|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}}

Despite New Agers' appeals to science, most of the academic and scientific establishments dismiss "New Age science" as [[pseudo-science]], or at best existing in part on the fringes of genuine scientific research.{{sfnm|1a1=Hess|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} This is an attitude also shared by many active in the field of [[parapsychology]].{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=11}} In turn, New Agers often accuse the scientific establishment of pursuing a dogmatic and outmoded approach to scientific enquiry,{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=68}} believing that their own understandings of the universe will replace those of the academic establishment in a [[paradigm shift]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}}

===Ethics and afterlife===

There is no ethical cohesion within the New Age phenomenon,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=35}} although Hanegraaff argued that the central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=281}} Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic [[good and evil]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=277}} negative events that happen are interpreted not as the result of evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=236–237, 278}}
It rejects the Christian emphasis on [[sin]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=294–295}} It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing that if an individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=293}} Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=240}} Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=240—241}} and the visualisation of a white light.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=242}}

According to Hanegraaff, the question of death and afterlife is not a "pressing problem requiring an answer" in the New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=258}} A belief in [[reincarnation]] is very common, where it often viewed as being part of an individual's progressive spiritual evolution toward realisation of their own divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=262|2a1=York|2y=2001|2p=364|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=109}} In New Age literature, the reality of reincarnation is usually treated as self-evident, with no explanation as to why practitioners embrace this afterlife belief over others,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=263}} although New Agers endorse it in the belief that it ensures cosmic justice.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=264}} Many New Agers believe in [[karma]], treating it as a law of cause and effect that assures cosmic balance, although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=286}}
In much New Age literature on reincarnation, it is claimed that part of the human soul, that which carries the personality, perishes with the death of the body, while the Higher Self – that which connects with divinity – survives in order to be reborn into another body.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=266}} It is believed that the Higher Self chooses the body and circumstances into which it will be born, in order to use it as a vessel through which to learn new lessons and thus advance its own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=262}} Prominent New Age writers like [[Shakti Gawain]] and [[Louise Hay]] therefore express the view that humans are responsible for the events that happen to them during their life, an idea that many New Agers regard as empowering.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=234}} At times, past life regression are employed within the New Age in order to reveal a Higher Soul's previous incarnations, usually with an explicit healing purpose.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=271–275}} Some practitioners espouse the idea of a "soul group" or "soul family", a group of connected souls who reincarnate together as family of friendship units.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}} Rather than reincarnation, another afterlife belief found among New Agers holds that an individual's soul returns to a "universal energy" on bodily death.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}}

==Demographics==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=By the early twenty-first century... [the New Age phenomenon] has an almost entirely white, middle-class demography largely made up of professional, managerial, arts, and entrepreneurial occupations.|source=— Religious studies scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=223}} }}

In the mid-1990s, the New Age was found primarily in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|York|1995|p=42}} The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as "New Agers" renders it difficult to determine how many practitioners there are.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=112}} He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=120}} In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown to such an extent that they were "increasingly rivalling the sway of Christianity in western settings".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=4}}

Sociological investigation indicates that certain sectors of society are more likely to engage in New Age practices than others.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=223–224}} The majority of participants are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=121|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=53}} Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=220–221}} approximately two-thirds of its participants were female.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=220}}
The movement is strongly gendered; sociologist Ciara O'Connor argues that it shows a tension between commodification and women's empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Ciara, "Becoming whole: an exploration of women's choices in the holistic and New Age movement in Ireland". 220–39 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe described the "typical" participant in the New Age milieu as being "a religious individualist, mixing and matching cultural resources in an animated spiritual quest".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}}

[[File:Rave in the Henge 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Stonehenge at night, with revellers inside|[[Stonehenge]] is a site visited by New Age pilgrims, as seen in this midsummer rave]]

In the United States, the first people to embrace the New Age belonged to the [[baby boomer]] generation, those born between 1946 and 1964.{{sfn|Brown|1992|p=90}} 
Heelas added that within that broad demographic, the movement had nevertheless attracted a diverse clientele.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=136}} He typified the typical New Ager as someone who was well-educated yet disenchanted with mainstream society, thus arguing that the movement catered to those who believe that [[modernity]] is in crisis.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=137–138}} He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came to feel that they were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=142}} He believed that many individuals had been "culturally primed for what the New Age has to offer",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=172}} with the New Age attracting "expressive" people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement's self-spirituality focus.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=161–162}} It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=173}} He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of [[religious conversion]],{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=186}} others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=183}}

The degree to which individuals are involved in the New Age varies.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=117}} Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of "serious part-timers" who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of "casual part-timers" who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=118–119}} MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are "consultative" practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are "serious" practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are "non-practitioner consumers", individuals affected by he general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=73–74}} Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll for instance revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=52}}

In 1995, Kyle stated that on the whole, New Agers in the United States preferred the values of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] over those of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He added that most New Agers "soundly rejected" the agenda of former Republican President [[Ronald Reagan]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Social communities===

MacKian suggested that this phenomenon was "an inherently ''social'' mode of spirituality", one which cultivated a sense of belonging among its participants and encouraged relations both with other humans and with non-human, otherworldly spirit entities.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=136}}
MacKian suggested that these communities "may look very different" from those of traditional religious groups.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=135}}

Online connections were one of the ways that interested individuals met new contacts and established networks.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=131}}

==Commercial aspects==

[[File:New Age shop and Healing centre, St Albans, Hertfordshire.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|alt=New Age store along stone street with bicycles parked out front and large crystals behind display windows|Isis, a New Age shop named after the [[Isis|Ancient Egyptian goddess]] that is located in St Albans, southern England]]

Some New Agers advocate living in a [[simple living|simple]] and [[sustainable living|sustainable]] manner to reduce humanity's impact on the [[natural resource]]s of Earth; and they shun [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=74–75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Spring|first=Joel H.|title=How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGO's, and the Decline of the Nation-state|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, New Jersey, US|year=2004|edition=illustrated|page=119|chapter=Chapter 4: Love the Biosphere: Environmental Ideologies Shaping Global Society|isbn=978-0-8058-4915-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|archiveurl=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|accessdate=2009-03-27|archivedate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Age movement has been centered around rebuilding a [[sense of community]] to counter [[social disintegration]]; this has been attempted through the formation of [[intentional communities]], where individuals come together to live and work in a communal lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=200–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce argued that in seeking to "denying the validity of externally imposed controls and privileging the divine within", the New Age sought to dismantle pre-existing social order, but that it failed to present anything adequate in its place.{{sfn|Bruce|1998|pp=32–33}} Heelas however cautioned that Bruce had arrived at this conclusion based on "flimsy evidence".{{sfn|Heelas|1998|p=258}}

New Age centres have been set up in various parts of the world, representing an institutionalised form of the movement.{{sfn|York|1995|pp=40–41}} Notable examples include the [[Naropa Institute]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[Holly Hock Farm]] near to [[Vancouver]], the [[Wrekin Trust]] in [[West Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]], and the [[Skyros Centre]] in [[Skyros]].{{sfn|York|1995|p=41}}

Criticising mainstream Western education as counterproductive to the ethos of the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools for the education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=77–78}}

===Fairs and festivals===

New Age spirituality has led to a wide array of literature on the subject and an active niche market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, [[fair]]s, and [[festival]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
New Age fairs – sometimes known as "Mind, Body, Spirit fairs", "psychic fairs", or "alternative health fairs" – are spaces in which a variety of goods and services are displayed by different vendors, including forms of alternative medicine and esoteric practices such as palmistry or tarot card reading.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=181–183}} A prominent example is the [[Mind Body Spirit Festival]], held annually in the United Kingdom,{{sfnm|1a1=Partridge|1y=2004|1p=65|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=24}} at which – the religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge noted – one could encounter "a wide range of beliefs and practices from crystal healing to ... Kirlian photography to psychic art, from angels to past-life therapy, from Theosophy to UFO religion, and from New Age music to the vegetarianism of Suma Chign Hai."{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=65}} Similar festivals are held across Europe and in Australia and the United States.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=24}}

===Approaches to financial prosperity and business===

A number of New Age proponents have emphasised the use of spiritual techniques as a tool for attaining financial prosperity, thus moving the movement away from its counter-cultural origins.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=60–62}} Commenting on this "New Age capitalism", Hess observed that it was largely small-scale and entrepreneurial, focused around small companies run by members of the [[petty bourgeoisie]], rather than being dominated by large scale multinational corporations.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=38}} The links between New Age and commercial products have resulted in the accusation that New Age itself is little more than a manifestation of [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=6}} This idea is generally rejected by New Age participants, who often reject any link between their practices and consumerist activities.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=85}}

Embracing this attitude, various books have been published espousing such an ethos, established New Age centres have held spiritual retreats and classes aimed specifically at business people, and New Age groups have developed specialised training for businesses.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=62–65}} During the 1980s, many prominent U.S. corporations—among them [[IBM]], [[AT&amp;T]], and [[General Motors]]—embraced New Age seminars, hoping that they could increase productivity and efficiency among their work force,{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=127}} although in several cases this resulted in employees bringing legal action against their employers, claiming that such seminars had infringed on their religious beliefs or damaged their psychological health.{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=133}} However, the use of spiritual techniques as a method for attaining [[Profit (economics)|profit]] has been an issue of major dispute within the wider New Age movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=23|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}} with prominent New Agers such as Spangler and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]] criticising what they see as trends within the community that are narcissistic and lack a social conscience.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=358–361}} In particular, the movement's commercial elements have caused problems given that they often conflict with its general economically-egalitarian ethos; as York highlighted, "a tension exists in New Age between socialistic egalitarianism and capitalistic private enterprise".{{sfn|York|1995|p=40}}

Given that it encourages individuals to choose spiritual practices on the grounds of personal preference and thus encourages them to behave as a consumer, the New Age has been considered to be well suited to modern society.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=34}}

===Music===
{{See also|List of new-age music artists|List of ambient artists}}
The term "[[New Age music]]" is applied, sometimes in a derogative manner, to forms of [[ambient music]], a genre that developed in the 1960s and was popularised in the 1970s, particularly with the work of [[Brian Eno]].{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} The genre's relaxing nature resulted in it becoming popular within New Age circles,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} with some forms of the genre having a specifically New Age orientation.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}
Studies have determined that new-age music can be an effective component of [[stress management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Principles and Practice of Stress Management, Third Edition |editor-last=Lehrer |editor-first=Paul M. |editor2=Robert L. Woolfolk |editor3=Wesley E. Sime |year=2007|pages=46–47|isbn=978-1-59385-000-5|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style began in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label; such as [[Oregon (band)|Oregon]], the [[Paul Winter Consort]], and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician [[Daniel Kobialka]],&lt;ref name=Birosik&gt;Birosik, Patti Jean (1989).

New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic [[space music]] using [[synthesizer]]s and acoustic instrumentals using [[Native American flute]]s and [[drum]]s, [[singing bowl]]s, Australian [[didgeredoo]]s and [[world music]] sounds to spiritual [[chant]]ing from other cultures.&lt;ref name=Birosik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Werkhoven /&gt;

==Politics==

While many commentators have focused on the spiritual and cultural aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a political component. The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Richard (1995).  ''The New Age Movement in American Culture''.  University Press of America, Chap.&amp;nbsp;8 ("The New Age Reaches Out: Politics and Economics").  {{ISBN|978-0-7618-0010-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist of religion Steven Bruce noted that the New Age provides ideas on how to deal with "our socio-psychological problems".{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=23}}  Scholar of religion James R. Lewis observed that, despite the common caricature of New Agers as narcissistic, "significant numbers" of them were "trying to make the planet a better place on which to live," {{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}} and scholar J. Gordon Melton's ''New Age Encyclopedia'' (1990) included an entry called "New Age politics". {{sfn|Melton|1990| pp=323–325}}  Some New Agers have entered the political system in an attempt to advocate for the societal transformation that the New Age promotes.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}}

===Ideas===

Although New Age activists have been motivated by New Age concepts like holism, interconnectedness, monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse,{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} ranging from [[far right politics|far-right]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] through to [[liberalism|liberal]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[libertarianism|libertarian]].{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Accordingly, Kyle stated that "New Age politics is difficult to describe and categorize. The standard political labels—left or right, liberal or conservative–miss the mark."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} MacKian suggested that the New Age operated as a form of "world-realigning infrapolitics" that undermines the [[disenchantment]] of modern Western society.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=154}}

{{double image|left|Mark Satin in 2011.jpg
|141|BENJAMIN CREME 2006.jpg|139|Writers who have espoused political ideas influenced by New Age perspectives included [[Mark Satin]] (left) and [[Benjamin Creme]] (right).}}

The extent to which New Age spokespeople mix religion and politics varies.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=837}} New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as "fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete".{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} The New Ager [[Mark Satin]] for instance spoke of "New Age politics" as a politically radical "third force" that was "neither left nor right". He believed that in contrast to the conventional political focus on the "institutional and economic symptoms" of society's problems, his "New Age politics" would focus on "psychocultural roots" of these issues.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=833}} Ferguson regarded New Age politics as "a kind of Radical Centre", one that was "not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=832–833}} Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become sclerotic because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the ''Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}}  In Capra's view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological "systems view" of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}} [[Corinne McLaughlin]] argued that politics need not connote endless power struggles, that a new "spiritual politics" could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne, Alan J. (1999).  ''From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms''.  Praeger Publishers / Greenwood Publishing Group, p.&amp;nbsp;179.  {{ISBN|978-0-275-96151-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many New Agers advocate [[globalisation]] and [[Glocalization|localisation]], but reject [[nationalism]] and the role of the [[nation-state]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=842}} Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague about how this might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=842–843}} Satin for example argued for a move away from the nation-state and towards self-governing regions that, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=843}} [[Benjamin Creme]] conversely argued that "the Christ," a great [[Avatar]], Maitreya, the [[World Teacher]], expected by all the major religions as their "Awaited One," would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government in the form of the [[United Nations]]; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=845}} Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of [[democracy]] and citizens' involvement in policy making but are critical of [[representative democracy]] and [[majority rule]], thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Groups===

[[File:New World Alliance 1980.jpg|thumb |220px| right |alt=Twenty people sitting in a circle |The [[New World Alliance]] was one of several New Age political groups in the 1970s and 1980s.]]

University of California Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;267–270.  {{ISBN|978-0-520-05228-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1975 by California state legislator [[John Vasconcellos]] and others, it encouraged Californians to engage in personal growth work and political activities at the same time, especially at the grassroots level.&lt;ref&gt;Tipton, cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;267, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanegraaff noted another California-based group, the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]], headed by author [[Willis Harman]].  It advocated a change in consciousness – in "basic underlying assumptions" –  in order to come to grips with global crises.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=108–109}}  Kyle said that the New York City-based Planetary Citizens organization, headed by United Nations consultant and ''Earth at Omega'' author Donald Keys, sought to implement New Age political ideas.{{sfn|Kyle|1995|p=67}}

Scholar J. Gordon Melton and colleagues focused on the New World Alliance, a Washington, DC-based organization founded in 1979 by Mark Satin and others.  According to Melton et al., the Alliance tried to combine left- and right-wing ideas as well as personal growth work and political activities.  Group decision-making was facilitated by short periods of silence.{{sfn|Melton|1990|p=324}}  Sponsors of the Alliance's national political newsletter included Willis Harman and John Vasconcellos.&lt;ref&gt;Stein,  Arthur (1985).

Lewis counted "Green politics" as one of the New Age's more visible activities.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}}  One academic book claims that the [[History of the Green Party of the United States|U.S. Green Party movement]] began as an initiative of a handful of activists including [[Charlene Spretnak]], co-author of a "'new age' interpretation" of the German Green movement (Capra and Spretnak's ''Green Politics''), and Mark Satin, author of ''New Age Politics''.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, John (1998).

===In the 21st century===

[[File:Marianne Williamson.jpg|thumb |180px| right| alt=Head shot of a well-dressed woman with straight black hair |New Age author [[Marianne Williamson]] campaigned for a seat in the U.S. Congress in 2013–2014.]]

While the term "New Age" may have fallen out of favor,{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}}{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} scholar [[George Chryssides]] notes that the New Age by whatever name is "still alive and active" in the 21st century.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=22}}  In the realm of politics, New Ager Mark Satin's book ''Radical Middle'' (2004) reached out to mainstream liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgore, Ed (June 2004).

==Reception==

===Popular media===

Mainstream periodicals tended to be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book ''[[The Cultural Creatives]]'', what they called the media's "zest for attacking" New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 [[Lance Morrow]] essay in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} Nearly a decade earlier, ''Time'' had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a head shot of a famous actress beside the headline, "'''Om....''' THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (7 December 1987), vol. 130, issue no. 23, front cover.&lt;/ref&gt;  The story itself, by former ''[[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]'' editor [[Otto Friedrich]], was sub-titled, "A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition Is Sweeping Across the Country".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Otto (7 December 1987).  "New Age Harmonies".  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, vol. 130, issue no. 23, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, the magazine ''[[The New Republic]]'' ran a four-page critique of New Age culture and politics by journalist [[Richard Bradley (writer)|Richard Blow]] entitled simply, "Moronic Convergence".&lt;ref&gt;Blow, Richard (25 January 1988).  "Moronic Convergence".  ''[[The New Republic]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some New Agers and New Age sympathizers responded to such criticisms.  For example, sympathizers Ray and Anderson said that much of it was an attempt to "stereotype" the movement for idealistic and spiritual change, and to cut back on its popularity.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} New Age theoretician David Spangler tried to distance himself from what he called the "New Age glamour" of crystals, talk-show channelers, and other easily commercialized phenomena, and sought to underscore his commitment to the New Age as a vision of genuine social transformation.{{sfnp|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=104–105}}

===Academia===
[[File:Wouter Hanegraaff 2006 Alchemy Conference.jpg|thumb|right|One of the first academics to study the New Age was Wouter Hanegraaff]]

Initially, academic interest in the New Age was minimal.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} The earliest academic studies of the New Age phenomenon were performed by specialists in the study of new religious movements such as [[Robert Ellwood]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1p=6|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=3}} This research was often scanty because many scholars regarded the New Age as an insignificant cultural fad.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=x}} Having been influenced by the U.S. [[anti-cult movement]], much of it was also largely negative and critical of New Age groups.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=15}} The "first truly scholarly study" of the phenomenon was an [[edited volume]] put together by James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton in 1992.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} From that point on, the number of published academic studies steadily increased.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}}

In 1994, [[Christoph Bochinger]] published his study of the New Age in Germany, ''"New Age" und moderne Religion''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} This was followed by Michael York's sociological study in 1995 and Richard Kyle's U.S.-focused work in 1995.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=21}} In 1996, Paul Heelas published a sociological study of the movement in Britain, being the first to discuss its relationship with business.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=21–22}} That same year, Wouter Hanegraaff published ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', a historical analysis of New Age texts;{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=4–6}} Hammer later described it as having "a well-deserved reputation as the standard reference work on the New Age".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=22}} Most of these early studies were based on a textual analysis of New Age publications, rather than on an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] analysis of its practitioners.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=13}}

Sutcliffe and Gilhus argued that 'New Age studies' could be seen as having experienced two waves; in the first, scholars focused on "macro-level analyses of the content and boundaries" of the "movement", while the second wave featured "more variegated and contextualized studies of particular beliefs and practices".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}} Sutcliffe and Gilhus have also expressed concern that, as of 2013, 'New Age studies' has yet to formulate a set of research questions scholars can pursue.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}}
The New Age has proved a challenge for scholars of religion operating under more formative models of what "religion" is.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=5}} By 2006, Heelas noted that the New Age was so vast and diverse that no scholar of the subject could hope to keep up with all of it.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=15}}

===Christian perspectives===

Mainstream Christianity has typically rejected the ideas of the New Age.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}} Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist wing]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=201}} In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=152}} During that decade, evangelical writers such as [[Constance Cumbey]], [[Dave Hunt (Christian apologist)|Dave Hunt]], [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], and [[Douglas Groothuis]] published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating [[conspiracy theories]] regarding the origin and purpose of the movement.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=154}} The most successful such publication however was [[Frank E. Peretti]]'s 1986 novel ''[[This Present Darkness]]'', which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with [[feminism]] and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=156}}

Official responses to the New Age have been produced by major Christian organisations like the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Church of England]], and [[Methodist Church]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}}
The Roman Catholic Church published ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]'' in 2003, following a six-year study; the 90-page document criticizes New Age practices such as yoga, meditation, [[feng shui]], and crystal healing.&lt;ref name="BBC Vatican"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm|title=Vatican sounds New Age alert|date=2003-02-04|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of vocational psychology'' by W. Bruce Walsh, Mark Savickas. 2005. p. 358. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-4517-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Vatican, euphoric states attained through New Age practices should not be confused with prayer or viewed as signs of God's presence.&lt;ref name="NY Times Vatican"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1D61531F934A35752C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=|title=Trying to Reconcile the Ways of the Vatican and the East |last=Steinfels|first=Peter|date=1990-01-07|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Paul Poupard]], then-president of the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]], said the "New Age is a misleading answer to the oldest hopes of man".&lt;ref name="BBC Vatican" /&gt; Monsignor [[Michael L. Fitzgerald|Michael Fitzgerald]], then-president of the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]], stated at the Vatican conference on the document: the "Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age".&lt;ref name="Holy See"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html |title=Presentations of Holy See's Document on "New Age" |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Michael L. |last2=Poupard |first2=Paul |year=2003 |work=Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of Life: a Christian Reflection on the "New Age" |publisher=Roman Catholic Church |accessdate=2010-11-06 |location=Vatican City}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are other Christian groups that have adopted a more positive view of the New Age, among them the [[New Age Catholics]], [[Christaquarians]], and [[Christians Awakening to a New Awareness]], all of which believe that New Age ideas can enhance a person's Christian faith.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|pp=21–22}}

===Contemporary Pagan perspectives===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Neopagan practices highlight the centrality of the relationship between humans and nature and reinvent religions of the past, while New Agers are more interested in transforming individual consciousness and shaping the future."|source=— Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}} }}

An issue of academic debate has been regarding the connection between the New Age movement and contemporary [[Paganism]], or [[Modern Paganism|Neo-Paganism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} The two phenomena have often being confused and conflated, particularly in Christian critiques.{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that there was a "significant overlap" between the two religious movements,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=vii}} while [[Aidan A. Kelly]] stated that Paganism "parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways".{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=136}} Other scholars have identified them as distinct phenomena that share overlap and commonalities.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1pp=364–365|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=9}} Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary Paganism were not part of the New Age movement – particularly those that pre-dated the movement – other Pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=78}} Partridge portrayed both Paganism and the New Age as different streams of [[occulture]] ([[occult]] culture) that merge at points.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=78}}

Various differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a [[Universalism|universalist]] message that sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas Paganism stresses the difference between [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]] and those embracing a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] or [[Animism|animistic]] theology.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} While the New Age emphasises a light-centred image, Paganism acknowledges both light and dark, life and death, and recognises the savage side of the natural world.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=79}} Many Pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using "New Age" as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of Paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=9}}
Many Pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the Pagan movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1992|1p=139|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} with some Pagans pronouncing the word "newage" to rhyme with "[[sewage]]".{{sfn|Blain|Wallis|2007|p=6}}

===Non-Western and indigenous responses===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In the case of New Age, its solipsism, coupled with its advocacy of free market principles, opens the world's spiritual arena as an opportunity for spiritual exploitation and even capitalistic imperialism. Not only does it encourage a paradoxical homogenizing to the cultural standards of North Atlantic civilization, exemplified in its affirmation that 'we are all one', but it also carries an implicit judgement of inferior status for non-hegemonic cultures, inasmuch as they are not considered to be the ones who decide what is to be shared and what is not."|source=— Sociologist Michael York.{{sfn|York|2001|pp=367–368}} }}

One of the most contentious aspects of the New Age has been its adoption of spiritual ideas and practises from other, particularly non-Western cultures.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Its belief that all traditions are free for anyone to use, rather than the [[private property]] of particular communities, has resulted in New Agers adopting and marketing the practices of [[Third World]] societies.{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}} These have included "Hawaiian [[Kahuna]] magic, Australian Aboriginal dream-working, South American Amerindian ''[[ayahuasca]]'' and ''San Pedro'' ceremony, Hindu Ayurveda and yoga, and Chinese Feng Shui, [[Qigong|Qi Gong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]".{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}}

===Political writers and activists===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="New Age politics might be seen not as a wayward, pathological creature of the New Left's imagination, but as a political innocent in candid, questioning dialogue with the unclaimed mainstream territory of progressive, rather than atomistic, individualism.  Indeed, if we were to examine some of the social and political threads that run through the aery fabric of New Age thinking, we would find certain themes that resonate with the necessary conditions for a left version of progressive individualism.  Generally speaking, New Age addresses its adherents as active participants, with a measure of control over their everyday lives. ...  The New Age 'person' is also in many respects an individual whose personal growth is indissociable from the environment; a link fleshed out in a variety of ecotopian stories and romances.  So, too, the small-scale imperative of New Age's cooperative communitarianism brings with it a host of potentially critical positions. ..."|source=— Scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]], 1991.{{sfn|Ross|1991|p=69}} }}

Toward the end of the 20th century, some social and political analysts and activists were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;Gerzon, Mark (1996).  ''A House Divided: Six Belief Systems Struggling for America's Soul''.  A Jeremy P. Tarcher Putnam Book / G. P. Putnam's Sons, Chap. 5 ("Gaia: The Transformation State").  {{ISBN|978-0-87477-823-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayne (1999), cited above, Chap. 11 ("Spiritual Politics").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray and Anderson (2000), cited above, Chap. 7 ("A Great Current of Change").&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, some political scientists launched the "Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics" of the [[American Political Science Association]],&lt;ref&gt;"Preface: Paths to Transformational Politics".  In Woolpert, Stephen; Slaton, Christa Daryl; and Schwerin, Edward W., eds. (1998).  ''Transformational Politics: Theory, Study, and Practice''.  State University of New York Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;ix–xi.  {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3945-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and an academic book prepared by three of them stated that the "transformational politics" concept was meant to subsume such terms as ''new age'' and ''new paradigm''.&lt;ref&gt;Slaton, Christa Daryl; Woolpert, Stephen; Schwerin, Ed.  "Introduction: What Is Transformational Politics?"   In Woolpert et al. (1998), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;xix.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]] suggested that New Age political ideas – however muddled and naïve – could help [[Progressivism in the United States#Progressivism in the 21st century|progressives]] construct an appealing alternative to both atomistic individualism and self-denying collectivism. {{sfn|Ross|1991|pp=65–72 ("New Age politics" sub-chapter)}}  In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions to pay more attention to the New Age's interest in such topics as "new socio-political thinking" and "New Economics",{{sfn|Rose|2005b|p=165}} topics Rose discussed in his book ''Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus'', issued by a European academic publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Stuart (2005).  ''Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus''. [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]], Chap. 8 ("Community Activity").  {{ISBN|978-0-8204-7241-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other political thinkers and activists saw New Age politics less positively.  On the political right, author [[George Weigel]] argued that New Age politics was just a retooled and pastel-colored version of leftism.&lt;ref&gt;Weigel, George (March 1989).  "No Options".  ''American Purpose'', vol. 3, no. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative evangelical writer Douglas Groothuis, discussed by scholars Hexham{{sfn|Hexham|1992| p=54}} and Kemp,{{sfn|Kemp|2004| p=52}} warned that New Age politics could lead to an oppressive world government.&lt;ref&gt;Groothuis, Douglas (1987).  "Politics: Building an International Platform".  In Hoyt, Karen, ed., ''The New Age Rage''. Fleming H. Revell Company / Baker Publishing Group, pp.&amp;nbsp;92–93 and 103–105.  {{ISBN|978-0-8007-5257-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001).  ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''.  Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;169.  {{ISBN|978-0-521-79252-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek, Slavoj]] (2000).  ''The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology''.  Verso Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2 and 70.  {{ISBN|978-1-85984-291-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the reality of economic and political power.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Carl (2000).  ''The End of Politics: Corporate Power and the Decline of the Public Sphere''.  Guilford Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–72.  {{ISBN|978-1-57230-504-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another academic, [[Dana L. Cloud]], wrote a lengthy critique of New Age politics as a political ideology;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, Dana L. (1998). ''Control and Consolation in American Culture and Politics: Rhetorics of Therapy''. Sage Publications, Chap. 6 ("The New Age of Post-Marxism").  {{ISBN|978-0-7619-0506-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; she faulted it for not being opposed to the [[capitalist system]], or to liberal individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud (1998), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;144, 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of New Age often made by leftists is that its focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=8}} This perspective regards New Age as a manifestation of consumerism that promotes [[elitism]] and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|pp=6–7}}  New Agers who do engage in socio-political activism have also been criticized.  Journalist [[Harvey Wasserman]] suggested that New Age activists were too averse to social conflict to be effective politically.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Harvey (31 August 1985). "The New Age Movement: The Politics of Transcendence".  ''[[The Nation]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;147 (discussing the ideas of activist Shelly Kellman).&lt;/ref&gt; Melton et al. found that New Age activists' commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making led to "extended meetings and minimal results",{{sfn|Melton|1990| p=324}} and a pair of futurists concluded that one once-promising New Age activist group had been both "too visionary and too vague" to last.&lt;ref&gt;Lipnack, Jessica; Stamps, Jeffrey (1982).  ''Networking: The First Report and Directory'', Doubleday, p.&amp;nbsp;106. {{ISBN|978-0-385-18121-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open Group information security management maturity model' ('''O-ISM3''') is an Information Security Management Framework that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing information security management systems.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==History==
The original motivation behind O-ISM3 development was to narrow the gap between theory and practice for information security management systems, and the trigger was the idea of linking security management and maturity models. O-ISM3 strove to keep clear of a number of pitfalls with previous approaches.&lt;ref name="mikko"&gt;Siponen, Mikko (2002-08-24). Designing Secure Information Systems and Software: Critical evaluation of the existing approaches and a new paradigm. ''OULU 2002'', 24 August 2002. Retrieved from http://jultika.oulu.fi/files/isbn9514267907.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project looked at [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]], [[ISO 9000]], [[COBIT]], [[ITIL]], [[ISO/IEC 27001:2013]], and other standards, and found some potential for improvement in several fields, such as linking security to business needs, using a process based approach, providing some additional details (who, what, why) for implementation, and suggesting specific metrics, while preserving compatibility with current IT and security management standards.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Availability==
[[The Open Group]] provides O-ISM3 free of charge to organisations for their own internal noncommercial purposes.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

[[File:SummaryDiagramVertical.png|frame|right|The transition of [[communication technology]]: [[oral culture]], [[manuscript culture]], print culture, and [[Information Age]]]]
'''Print culture''' embodies all forms of printed text and other printed forms of [[visual communication]]. One prominent scholar in the field is [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]], who contrasted print culture, which appeared in Europe in the centuries after the advent of the Western [[printing-press]] (and much earlier in China where [[woodblock printing]] was used from 594 AD), to ''scribal culture''. [[Walter Ong]], by contrast, has contrasted written culture, including scribal, to [[oral culture]]. Ong is generally considered one of the first scholars to define print culture in contrast to [[oral culture]].  These views are related as the printing press brought a vast rise in literacy, so that one of its effects was simply the great expansion of written culture at the expense of oral culture.  The development of [[printing]], like the development of [[writing]] itself, had profound effects on human societies and knowledge. "Print culture" refers to the cultural products of the printing transformation.

In terms of image-based communication, a similar transformation came in Europe from the fifteenth century on with the introduction of the [[old master print]] and, slightly later, [[popular prints]], both of which were actually much quicker in reaching the mass of the population than printed text.

Print culture is the conglomeration of effects on human society that is created by making printed forms of communication. Print culture encompasses many stages as it has evolved in response to technological advances. Print culture can first be studied from the period of time involving the gradual movement from oration to script as it is the basis for print culture. As the printing became commonplace, script became insufficient and printed documents were [[mass production|mass-produced]]. The era of physical print has had a lasting effect on human culture, but with the advent of digital text, some scholars believe the printed word is becoming obsolete.

The [[electronic media]], including the [[World Wide Web]], can be seen as an outgrowth of print culture.

== The development of print ==

===Prior to print===
[[Oral culture]] was all that existed. Oral culture gradually found the need to store what was said for long periods of time, and slowly developed scribal culture. Scribal culture being inaccurate and tedious at best developed into print culture. Each segment is rich with its own effects on the world. Scribal culture, defined by the written or physical conveying of ideas, is important to understand in achieving a grasp on the unfolding of print culture itself. Scholars disagree over when scribal culture developed. [[Walter Ong]] argues that scribal culture cannot exist until an alphabet is created, and a form of writing standardized. On the other hand, [[D. F. McKenzie]] argues that even communicative notches on a stick, or structure, represent “text”, and therefore scribal culture.

Ong suggests scribal culture is defined by an alphabet. McKenzie says that the key to scribal culture is non-verbal communication, which can be accomplished in more ways than using an alphabet. These two views give rise to the importance of print culture. In scribal culture, procuring documents was a difficult task, and documentation would then be limited to the rich only. Ideas are difficult to spread amongst large groups of people over large distances of land, not allowing for effective dissemination of knowledge.

Scribal culture also deals with large levels of inconsistency. It was always considered that the oldest document was the most accurate, as it had been copied the least. In the process of copying documents, many times the meaning became changed, and the words different. Reliance on the written text of the time was never exceedingly strong. Over time, a greater need for reliable, quickly reproduced, and a relatively inexpensive means of distributing written text arose. Scribal culture, transforming into print culture, was only replicated in manners of written text.

===Development of print===
[[Image:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]])]] 
The Chinese invention of [[paper]] and [[woodblock printing]], at some point before the first dated [[book]] in 868 (the [[Diamond Sutra]]) produced the world's first print culture.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 1-4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of [[books]], on subjects ranging from [[Confucian|Confusion Classics]] to [[science]] and [[mathematics]], were printed using [[woodblock printing]].

[[Paper]] and [[woodblock printing]] were introduced into Europe in the 15th Century, and the first printed [[book]]s began appearing in Europe. Chinese movable type was spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]]. Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing which was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15-23, 61-73.&lt;/ref&gt; East metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Polenz, Peter von. |title = Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

S. Stavrianos]] |title=A Global History: From Prehistory to the 21st Century |edition=7th |year=1998 |origyear=1970 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-923897-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s [[printing press]] (circa 1450) greatly reduced the amount of labor required to produce a book leading to a tremendous increase in the number of books produced. Early printers tried to keep their printed copies of a text as faithful as possible to the original manuscript. Even so, the earliest publications were still often different from the original, for a short time, in some ways [[manuscript]]s still remaining more accurate than printed books.

Hand-copied illustrations were replaced by first [[woodcut]]s, later [[engraving]]s that could be duplicated precisely, revolutionizing technical literature (Eisenstein 155).

== Print culture, the Renaissance, and the Reformation ==
Eisenstein has described how the high costs of copying scribal works often led to their abandonment and eventual destruction.  Furthermore, the cost and time of copying led to the slow propagation of ideas. In contrast, the printing press allowed rapid propagation of ideas, resulting in knowledge and cultural movements that were far harder to destroy.

Eisenstein points to prior renaissances (rebirths) of classical learning prior to the printing press that failed.  In contrast, the Renaissance was a permanent revival of classical learning because the printing of classical works put them into a permanent and widely read form.

Similarly, Eisenstein points to a large number of prior attempts in Western Europe to assert doctrines contrary to the ruling Catholic Church.  In contrast, the [[Protestant Reformation]] spread rapidly and permanently due to the printing of non-conformist works such as the [[95 Theses]].

===Renaissance===
With the shift towards printing presses in the West, after [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a method that was cheap, fast, and filling the demand for books, the Renaissance truly came into its own.  Even though the printing press was a paradigm shifting invention, printing had many critics, who were afraid that books could spread lies and subversion or corrupt unsuspecting readers.  Also, they were afraid that the printed texts would spread heresy and sow religious discord.  The [[Gutenberg Bible]] was the first book produced with moveable type in Europe.  Martin Luther's Bible, which was published in German in 1522, started the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Latin's importance as a language started languishing with the rise of texts written in national languages.  The shift from scholarly Latin to everyday languages marked an important turning point in print culture.  The vernacular Bibles were important to other nations, as well.  The [[Authorized King James Version|King James]] Authorized Version was published in 1611, for example.  Along with the religious tracts, the scientific revolution was largely due to the printing press and the new print culture.  Scholarly books were more accessible, and the printing press provided more accurate diagrams and symbols.  Along with scientific texts, like the works of [[Copernicus]],  [[Galileo]], and [[Tycho Brahe]], atlases and cartography started taking off within the new print culture, mostly due to the exploration of different nations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
With the rise of literacy, books and other texts became more entrenched in the culture of the West.  Along with literacy and more printed words also came censorship, especially from governments.  In France, [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]] were both imprisoned for their works.  Other authors, like [[Montesquieu]] and [[Diderot]], had to publish outside France.  Censored books became a valuable commodity within this environment, and an underground network of book smugglers started operating within France.  Diderot and Jean d'Alembert created the ''[[Encyclopedie]]'', which was published in 1751 in seventeen folio volumes with eleven volumes of engravings.  This work embodied the essence of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print culture and the American Revolution==

===A profound impact===
Numerous eras throughout history have been defined through the use of print culture. The [[American Revolution]] was a major historical conflict fought after print culture brought the rise of literacy. Furthermore, print culture's ability to shape and guide society was a critical component before, during, and after the Revolution.

===Pre-Revolution===
Many different printed documents influenced the beginning of the revolution. The [[Magna Carta]] was originally a scribal document of 1215, recording an oral transaction restricting the power of English kings and defining rights of subjects. It was revitalized by being printed in the 16th century and widely read by the increasingly literate English and colonial population thereafter.  The Magna Carta was used as a basis for the development of English liberties by [[Sir Edward Coke]] and became a basis for writing the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

Additionally, during the 18th century, the production of printed newspapers in the colonies greatly increased. In 1775, more copies of newspapers were issued in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] than were printed in all of New England in 1754, showing that the existence of the conflict developed a need for print culture. This onslaught of printed text was brought about by the anonymous writings of men such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was noted for his many contributions to the newspapers, including the [[Pennsylvania Gazette]]. This increase was primarily due to the easing of the government's tight control of the press, and without the existence of a relatively free press, the American Revolution may have never taken place. The production of so many newspapers can mostly be attributed to the fact that newspapers had a huge demand; printing presses were writing the newspapers to complain about the policies of the British government, and how the British government was taking advantage of the colonists.

In 1775, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote the pamphlet "[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]," a pamphlet that introduced many ideas of freedom to the Colonial citizens. Allegedly, half a million copies were produced during the pre-revolution era. This number of pamphlets produced is significant as there were only a few million freed men in the colonies. However, "Common Sense" was not the only manuscript that influenced people and the tide of the revolution. Among the most influential were [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]]' "Rights of the British Colonies" and  [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]]'s "Farmer's Letters". Both of these played a key role in persuading the people and igniting the revolution.

===During the Revolution===
Newspapers were printed during the revolution covering battle reports and propaganda. These reports were usually falsified by Washington in order to keep morale up among American citizens and troops. Washington was not the only one to falsify these reports, as other generals (on both sides) used this technique as well. The newspapers also covered some of the battles in great detail, especially the ones that the American forces won, in order to gain support from other countries in hopes that they would join the American forces in the fight against the British.

Before the Revolution, the British placed multiple acts upon the colonies, such as the [[stamp act]]. Many newspaper companies worried that the British would punish them for printing papers without a British seal, so they were forced to temporarily discontinue their work or simply change the title of their paper. However, some patriotic publishers, particularly those in Boston, continued their papers without any alteration of their title.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is a very important written document that was drafted by the original thirteen colonies, as a form of print culture that would declare their independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain and explained the justifications for doing so.  While it was explicitly documented on July 4, 1776, it was not recognized by [[Great Britain]] until September 3, 1783, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].

===Post-Revolution===
After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], a cluster of free states in need of a government was created. The basis for this government was known as the [[Articles of Confederation]], which were put to effect in 1778 and formed the first governing document of the United States of America. This document, however, was found to be unsuitable to outline the structure of the government, and thus showed an ineffectual use of print culture, and since printed texts were the most respected documents of the time, this called for an alteration in the document used to govern the confederation.

It was the job of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] to reform the document, but they soon discovered that an entirely new text was needed in its place. The result was the [[United States Constitution]]. In the form of written word, the new document was used to grant more power to the central government, by expanding into branches. After it was ratified by all of the states in the union, the Constitution served as a redefinition of the modern government.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] was noted as saying, “The basis of our government being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter.” This serves as an excellent example of how newspapers were highly regarded by the colonial people. In fact, much like other forms of 18th century print culture, newspapers played a very important role in the government following the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Not only were they one of the few methods in the 18th century to voice the opinion of the people, they also allowed for the ideas to be disseminated to a wide audience, a primary goal of printed text. A famous example of the newspaper being used as a medium to convey ideas were the [[Federalist Papers]]. These were first published in New York City newspapers in 1788 and pushed for people to accept the idea of the United States Constitution by enumerating 85 different articles that justified its presence, adding to a series of texts designed to reinforce each other, and ultimately serving as a redefinition of the 18th century.

== The state of print today ==
Today, print has matured to a state where the majority of modern society has come to have certain expectations regarding the printed book:
* The knowledge contained by printed books is believed to be accurate.
* The cited author of a printed book does indeed exist and is actually the person who wrote it.
* Every copy of a printed book is identical (at least in the important aspects) to every other copy, no matter how far apart the locations are in which they are sold.

Copyright laws help to protect these standards. However, a few regions do exist in the world where literary [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] has become a standard commercial practice. In such regions, the preceding expectations are not the norm. (Johns 61)

Currently, there are still approximately 2.3 billion books still sold each year worldwide. However, this number is steadily decreasing due to the ever-growing popularity of the [[Internet]] and other forms of digital media.

== Transition to the digital era ==
As David J. Gunkel states in his article "What's the Matter with Books?", society is currently in the late age of the text; the moment of transition from print to electronic culture where it is too late for printed books and yet too early for electronic texts. Jay David Bolter, author of ''Writing Space'', also discusses our culture in what he calls "the late age of print."  The current debate going on in the literary world is whether or not the computer will replace the printed book as the repository and definition of human knowledge. There is still a very large audience committed to printed texts, who are not interested in moving to a digital representation of the repository for human knowledge. Bolter, in his own scholarship and also along with Richard Grusin in ''Remediation'', explains that despite current fears about the end of print, the format will never be erased but only remediated.  New forms of technology (new media) will be created which utilize features of old media, thus preventing old media's (aka print's) erasure.  At the same time, there are also concerns over whether obsolescence and deterioration make digital media unsuitable for long-term archival purposes. Much of the early paper used for print is highly acidic, and will ultimately destroy itself.

The way that information is transferred has also changed with this new age of digital text and the shift towards electronic media. Gunkel states that information now takes the form of immaterial bits of digital data that are circulated at the speed of light. Consequently, what the printed book states about the exciting new culture and economy of bits is abraded by the fact that this information has been delivered in the slow and outdated form of physical paper.

In the article, [http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/%7Eeleclaw/ylj5.html "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment"], the author notes that expectations will change as information becomes less tied to specific locations, and as machines become networked and linked to other machines. This means that in the future certain goods will not be associated with their origins.

The article "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060619192001/http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~eleclaw/ylj4.html]) also mentions how the new electronic age will make print better. Placing information into electronic form not only liberates the information from its pages but removes the need for specialized spaces to hold particular kinds of information. People have become increasingly accustomed to acquiring information from our homes that used to be only accessible from an office or library. Once computers are all [[computer networking|networked]], all information should, at least in theory, be accessible from all places. Print itself contained a set of invisible and inherent censors, which [[electronic media]] is helping to remove from the creation of text. Points of control that are present in print space are no longer present as distribution channels multiply, as copying becomes faster and cheaper, as more information is produced, as economic incentives for working with information increase, and as barriers and boundaries that inhibited working with information are crossed.

== Changes in technology and its effect on print culture ==
There are more online publications, [[Academic journal|journals]], [[newspaper]]s, [[magazines]], and businesses than ever before. While this brings society closer, and makes publications more convenient and accessible, ordering a product online reduces contact with others. Many online articles are anonymous, making the '[[death of the author]]' even more apparent. Anyone can post articles and journals online anonymously. In effect, the individual becomes separated from the rest of society.

The advances of technology in print culture can be separated into three shifts: 
*spoken language to the written word, 
*the written word to Printing press, 
*the printing press to the computer/internet.

The written word has made history recordable and accurate.  The printing press, some may argue, is not a part of print culture, but had a substantial impact upon the development of print culture through the times. The printing press brought uniform copies and efficiency in print. It allowed a person to make a living from writing. Most importantly, it spread print throughout society.

The advances made by technology in print also impact anyone using cell phones, laptops, and personal digital organizers. From novels being delivered via a cell phone, the ability to text message and send letters via e-mail clients, to having entire libraries stored on PDAs, print is being influenced by devices.

== Non-textual forms of print culture ==

Symbols, logos and printed images are forms of printed media that do not rely on text. They are ubiquitous in modern urban life. Analyzing these cultural products is an important part of the field of [[cultural studies]].  Print has given rise to a wider distribution of pictures in society in conjunction with the printed word.  Incorporation of printed pictures in magazines, newspapers, and books gave printed material a wider mass appeal through the ease of [[visual culture|visual communication]].

== Text and Print ==

There is a common miscommunication that occurs when discussing that which is
print and that which is text. In the literary world, notable scholars such as
[[Walter Ong]] and [[D.F. McKenzie]] have disagreed on the meaning of text. The
point of the discussion at hand is to have a word that encompasses all forms
of communication - that which is printed, that which is online media, even a
building or notches on a stick.  According to Walter Ong text did not come
about until the development of the first alphabet, well after humanity existed.
According to Mckenzie primitive humans did have a form of text they used to
communicate with their cave drawings.  This is discussed in [[literary theory]]. Print, however, is a representation of that which is printed, and
does not encompass all forms of communication (e.g. a riot at a football game).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8248">'''Quantitative history''' is an approach to [[history|historical research]] that makes use of [[Quantitative research|quantitative]], [[statistical]] and [[computer]] tools. It is considered a branch of ''social science history'' and has four leading journals: ''Historical Methods'' (1967- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heldref.org/hm.php Historical Methods online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216043317/http://www.heldref.org/hm.php |date=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Journal of Interdisciplinary History]]'' (1968- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jih/ Journal of Interdisciplinary History online]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Social Science History'' (1976- ),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssh.dukejournals.org/ Social Science History online]&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics ''Cliodynamics: The Journal of Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution''] (2010- ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/irows_cliodynamics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative historians start with databases. Large quantities of economic and demographic data are available in print format. Quantifiers move these into computerized databases. The largest repository is the [[Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research]] (ICPSR) at the [[University of Michigan]], which provides access to an extensive collection of downloadable political and social data for the [[United States]] and the world.

== Data bases: economic ==

[[Economic historian]]s use major data sets, especially those collected by governments since the 1920s. Historians of slavery have used census data, sales receipts and price information to reconstruct the economic history of slavery.

''[[Content analysis]]'' is a technique borrowed from journalism research whereby newspapers, magazines or similar sources are numerically coded according to a standardized list of topics. [Neuendorf, ''The Content Analysis Guidebook'' (2002)]

== Political history ==

Quantifiers study topics like voting behavior of groups in elections, the roll call behavior of legislators, public opinion distribution, and the occurrence rate of wars and legislation.  '''Collective biography'' uses standardized information on a large group to deduce patterns of thought and behavior.

== New social history ==

The "new [[social historian]]s" (new in the 1960s) use census data and other data sets to study entire populations. Topics include demographic issues such as population growth rates, rates of birth, death, marriage and disease, occupational and education distributions, and migrations and population changes.

An especially challenging technique is linking names ("nominal record linkage") of the same person whose information appears in multiple source such as censuses, city directories, employment files and voting registration lists.

== Cliodynamics ==
[[Cliodynamics]] employs a scientific approach to the study of history and combines insights from [[cultural evolution]], [[macrosociology]], and [[economic history]]/[[cliometrics]] to produce and analyse large quantitative datasets and identify general principles about the evolutionary dynamics and functioning of historical societies.

== Topics ==

In 2007-2008, the most viewed articles in ''Social Science History'' represented the breadth and style of the field. The five most viewed were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssh.dukejournals.org/reports/mfr1.dtl Reports], dukejournals.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--not working, 5 May 20019--&gt;

Laherrère and D. Sornette&lt;/ref&gt; except in the cases of the two "[[King effect|Kings]]": [[China]] and [[India]].]]
'''Rank-size distribution''' is the distribution of size by rank, in decreasing order of size. For example, if a data set consists of items of sizes 5, 100, 5, and 8, the rank-size distribution is 100, 8, 5, 5 (ranks 1 through 4). This is also known as the '''rank-frequency distribution''', when the source data are from a [[frequency distribution]]. These are particularly of interest when the data vary significantly in scale, such as city size or word frequency. These distributions frequently follow a [[power law]] distribution, or less well-known ones such as a [[stretched exponential function]] or [[parabolic fractal distribution]], at least approximately for certain ranges of ranks; see below.

A rank-size distribution is not a [[probability distribution]] or [[cumulative distribution function]]. Rather, it is a discrete form of a [[quantile function]] (inverse cumulative distribution) in reverse order, giving the size of the element at a given rank.

==Simple rank-size distributions==
In the case of city populations, the resulting distribution in a country, a region, or the world will be characterized by its largest city, with other cities decreasing in size respective to it, initially at a rapid rate and then more slowly. This results in a few large cities and a much larger number of cities orders of magnitude smaller. For example, a rank 3 city would have one-third the population of a country's largest city, a rank 4 city would have one-fourth the population of the largest city, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of U.S. states' largest cities by population]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[[List of United States cities by population]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2016}}

When any [[log-linear]] factor is ranked, the ranks follow the [[Lucas numbers]], which consist of the sequentially additive numbers 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, etc. Like the more famous [[Fibonacci sequence]], each number is approximately 1.618 (the [[Golden ratio]]) times the preceding number. For example, the third term in the sequence above, 4, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 4.236; the fourth term, 7, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, or 6.854; the eighth term, 47, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, or 46.979. With higher values, the figures converge. An [[equiangular spiral]] is sometimes used to visualize such sequences.

== Segmentation ==
[[File:Wikipedia-n-zipf.png|thumb|Wikipedia word frequency plot, showing three segments with distinct behavior.]]

A rank-size (or rank-frequency) distribution is often segmented into ranges. This is frequently done somewhat arbitrarily or due to external factors, particularly for [[market segmentation]], but can also be due to distinct behavior as rank varies.

Most simply and commonly, a distribution may be split in two, termed the '''head''' and '''tail'''. If a distribution is broken into three pieces, the third (middle) piece has several terms, generically '''middle''',&lt;ref name="fishkin"&gt;[https://moz.com/blog/illustrating-the-long-tail Illustrating the Long Tail], Rand Fishkin, November 24th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; also '''belly''',&lt;ref name="young"&gt;[https://gigaom.com/2006/09/04/digg-that-fat-belly/ Digg that Fat Belly!], Robert Young, Sep. 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; '''torso''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/08/03/09/long-tail-guide The Long Tail Keyword Optimization Guide - How to Profit from Long Tail Keywords], August 3, 2009, Tom Demers&lt;/ref&gt; and '''body'''.&lt;ref name="liu"&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/b/lliu/archive/2005/03/12/394732.aspx The Small Head, the Medium Body, and the Long Tail .. so, where's Microsoft?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025939/http://blogs.technet.com/b/lliu/archive/2005/03/12/394732.aspx |date=2015-11-17 }}, 12 Mar 2005, Lawrence Liu's Report from the Inside&lt;/ref&gt; These frequently have some adjectives added, most significantly ''[[long tail]]'', also ''fat belly'',&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; ''chunky middle'', etc. In more traditional terms, these may be called ''top-tier'', ''mid-tier'', and ''bottom-tier''.

The relative sizes and weights of these segments (how many ranks in each segment, and what proportion of the total population is in a given segment) qualitatively characterizes a distribution, analogously to the [[skewness]] or [[kurtosis]] of a probability distribution. Namely: is it dominated by a few top members (head-heavy, like profits in the recorded music industry), or is it dominated by many small members (tail-heavy, like internet search queries), or distributed in some other way? Practically, this determines strategy: where should attention be focused?

These distinctions may be made for various reasons. For example, they may arise from differing properties of the population, as in the [[90–9–1 principle]], which posits that in an internet community, 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content. As another example, in marketing one may pragmatically consider the head as all members that receive personalized attention, such as personal phone calls; while the tail is everything else, which does not receive personalized attention, for example receiving [[form letter]]s; and the line is simply as far as resources allow, or where it makes business sense to stop.

Purely quantitatively, a conventional way of splitting a distribution into head and tail is to consider the head to be the first ''p'' portion of ranks, which account for &lt;math&gt;1 - p&lt;/math&gt; of the overall population, as in the 80:20 [[Pareto principle]], where the top 20% (head) comprises 80% of the overall population. The exact cutoff depends on the distribution – each distribution has a single such cutoff point—and for power laws can be computed from the [[Pareto index]].

Segments may arise naturally due to actual changes in behavior of the distribution as rank varies. Most common is the [[king effect]], where behavior of the top handful of items does not fit the pattern of the rest, as illustrated at top for country populations, and above for most common words in English Wikipedia. For higher ranks, behavior may change at some point, and be well-modeled by different relations in different regions; on the whole by a [[piecewise function]]. For example, if two different power laws fit better in different regions, one can use a [[broken power law]] for the overall relation; the word frequency in English Wikipedia (above) also demonstrates this.

The [[Yule–Simon distribution]] that results from [[preferential attachment]] (intuitively, "the rich get richer" and "success breeds success") simulates a broken power law and has been shown to "very well capture" word frequency versus rank distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf | title=Scaling laws in human speech, decreasing emergence of new words and a generalized model | author=Lin, Ruokuang|author2=Ma, Qianli D. Y.|author3=Bian, Chunhua | year=2014 | arxiv=1412.4846|bibcode=2014arXiv1412.4846L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It originated from trying to explain the population verses rank in different species. It has also been show to fit city population versus rank better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/a110361|title=A Growth Process for Zipf's and Yule's City-Size Laws|first=M F|last=Dacey|date=1 April 1979|publisher=|journal=Environment and Planning A|volume=11|issue=4|pages=361–372|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1068/a110361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rank-size rule ==
The '''rank-size rule''' (or '''law'''), describes the remarkable regularity in many phenomena, including the distribution of city sizes, the sizes of businesses, the sizes of particles (such as sand), the lengths of rivers, the frequencies of word usage, and wealth among individuals.

All are real-world observations that follow [[power law]]s, such as [[Zipf's law]], the [[Yule distribution]], or the [[Pareto distribution]]. If one ranks the population size of cities in a given country or in the entire world and calculates the [[natural logarithm]] of the rank and of the city population, the resulting graph will show a [[log-linear]] pattern.{{dubious|date=March 2013}} This is the rank-size distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.few.eur.nl/vanmarrewijk/geography/zipf/ Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213211558/http://people.few.eur.nl/vanmarrewijk/geography/zipf/ |date=2007-02-13 }} Steven Brakman, Harry Garretsen, and Charles van Marrewijk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical rationale===

One study claims that the rank size rule "works" because it is a "shadow" or coincidental measure of the true phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~copyrght/image/monog08/fulltext.pdf The Urban Rank-Size Hierarchy] James W. Fonseca&lt;/ref&gt; The true value of rank size is thus not as an accurate mathematical measure (since other power-law formulas are more accurate, especially at ranks lower than 10) but rather as a handy measure or "rule of thumb" to spot power laws. When presented with a ranking of data, is the third-ranked variable approximately one-third the value of the highest-ranked one? Or, conversely, is the highest-ranked variable approximately ten times the value of the tenth-ranked one? If so, the rank size rule has possibly helped spot another power law relationship.

==Known exceptions to simple rank-size distributions==

While Zipf's law works well in many cases, it tends to not fit the largest cities in many countries; one type of deviation is known as the [[King effect]]. A 2002 study found that Zipf's law was rejected for 53 of 73 countries, far more than would be expected based on random chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0641.pdf|title=Kwok Tong Soo (2002)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that variations of the Pareto exponent are better explained by political variables than by economic geography variables like proxies for economies of scale or transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199280988/01student/zipf/ Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302005906/http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199280988/01student/zipf/ |date=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study showed that Zipf's law did not work well for the five largest cities in six countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cuberes, David, The Rise and Decline of Cities, University of Chicago, September 29, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the richer countries, the distribution was flatter than predicted. For instance, in the [[United States]], although its largest city, [[New York City]], has more than twice the population of second-place [[Los Angeles]], the two cities' metropolitan areas (also the two largest in the country) are much closer in population. In metropolitan-area population, New York City is only 1.3 times larger than Los Angeles. In other countries, the largest city would dominate much more than expected. For instance, in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the capital, [[Kinshasa]], is more than eight times larger than the second-largest city, [[Lubumbashi]]. When considering the entire distribution of cities, including the smallest ones, the rank-size rule does not hold. Instead, the distribution is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]. This follows from [[Gibrat's law]] of proportionate growth.

Because exceptions are so easy to find, the function of the rule for analyzing cities today is to compare the city-systems in different countries.  The rank-size rule is a common standard by which urban primacy is established.  A distribution such as that in the United States or China does not exhibit a pattern of primacy, but countries with a dominant "[[primate city]]" clearly vary from the rank-size rule in the opposite manner.  Therefore, the rule helps to classify national (or regional) city-systems according to the degree of dominance exhibited by the largest city.  Countries with a primate city, for example, have typically had a colonial history that accounts for that city pattern.  If a normal city distribution pattern is expected to follow the rank-size rule (i.e. if the rank-size principle correlates with central place theory), then it suggests that those countries or regions with distributions that do not follow the rule have experienced some conditions that have altered the normal distribution pattern.  For example—the presence of multiple regions within large nations such as China and the United States tends to favor a pattern in which more large cities appear than would be predicted by the rule.  By contrast, small countries that had been connected (e.g. colonially/economically) to much larger areas will exhibit a distribution in which the largest city is much larger than would fit the rule, compared with the other cities—the excessive size of the city theoretically stems from its connection with a larger system rather than the natural hierarchy that central place theory would predict within that one country or region alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3218">'''SEETEP''' stands for  Solar Energy and Environmental Education Program. It is a project being run in Mawere District located in the [[Nyanza Province]]  of Kenya. Its purpose is to build  a self-sustaining solar energy and water management school in the area by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"About Seetep", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=4, Retrieved  2012-03-08,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==

Since 1992 [[Arc Aid and Arc Kenya|ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya]] have been running their development programs in Kenya through offices based in Majiwe District at the ARO Development Centre.&lt;ref&gt;"ARO Development Centre", http://www.arc-aid.no/aro-development-centre/, Retrieved 2012-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to make the centre more environmentally sustainable a partnership agreement was struck with [https://web.archive.org/web/20120415011530/http://www.elkem.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=241 Elkem Solar]. Elkem installed solar panels in  ARO Development Centre which is  very close to the equator and thus in a prime position for Elkem to simultaneously  carry out research and development on the solar panels. The partnership was possible since both ARC-Aid and Elkem Solar are based in Kristiansand.

ARC-Aid has also entered a partnership with [http://www.kvadraturen.vgs.no/ Kvadraturen School](also in Kristiansand) which has an alternative energy department. Every year a teacher and some students from this department travel to Kenya to gain some practical experience on solar panel maintenance and installation. Elkem Solar later expanded its installation program and laid down solar panels in [https://www.google.no/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=kisumu+polytechnic Kisumu Polytechnic] a technical school located in Nyanza. The interaction of these four partners led to the identification of a need for a school specialising in Solar Energy Technology and Water Resources Management. Elkem Solar would provide technical assistance to the school, Kvadraturen and Kisumu Polytechnic would develop the curriculum for the school while ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya would coordinate the efforts of the different organisations.

[[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation|NORAD]] is funding the project as part of their development activities. [http://www.vaf.no/hoved.aspx?m=8&amp;amid=59171 Vest-Agder County Municipality] has also pledged their support, donating funds and seeking other ways of involvement.

==Progress==

In 2010 the project officially began with the granting of funds by NORAD for a pilot project and the carrying out of feasibility research. The land on which the school will be built was acquired in 2011. The plot of land is located in Mawere District which is 100 kilometres from Kisumu. Construction has begun on the school using materials that have been developed in Kisumu Polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;"Seetep Progress", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=7,Retrieved 2012-05-03&lt;/ref&gt; A delegation from Kisumu Polytechnic will be visiting Kristiansand in the month of May in order to discuss the way forward with Kvadraturen School and ARC-Aid.

'''Samuel Irving "S.I." Newhouse Jr.''' (November 8, 1927 – October 1, 2017) was an American heir to a substantial magazine and media business. Together with his brother [[Donald Newhouse|Donald]], he owned [[Advance Publications]], founded by their late [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.|father]] in 1922, whose properties include [[Condé Nast]] (publisher of such magazines as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazines)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', etc.), dozens of newspapers across the United States (including ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', ''[[The Oregonian]]'', etc.), former cable company [[Bright House Networks]], and a controlling stake in [[Discovery Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/si-newhouse-obiturary|title=Si Newhouse Passes Away at Age 89|publisher=Vogue|accessdate=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was the son of Mitzi (née Epstein) and [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.]], the founder of Advance Publications.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

Sam then quit the Times to become associated with the Staten Island paper that formed the basis of his publication future. Newhouse attended the [[Horace Mann School]] in [[New York City]].

==Career==
Prior to his death, he had an estimated [[net worth]] of $9.5 billion, and he was ranked the 46th richest American by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine in 2014.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Newhouse gave money to charity, including $15 million to [[Syracuse University]]. He was also an art collector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felsenthal|first=Carol|title=Citizen Newhouse: Portrait of a Media Merchant|publisher=Seven Stories Press|year=1998|isbn=1-888363-87-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; who at one time owned one of the most valuable paintings in the world, a [[Jackson Pollock]] drip painting, titled ''[[No. 5, 1948]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/arts/design/02drip.html|work=The New York Times|title=A Pollock Is Sold, Possibly for a Record Price|first=Carol|last=Vogel|date=November 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newhouse was listed by ''[[Art News]]'' as among the top 200 art collectors in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2702 Newhouse reference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025202954/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2702 |date=2010-10-25 }}, artnews.com; accessed October 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
He was married to Jane Franke from 1951–59, and they had three children, Sam, Wynn (died 2010), and Pamela.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; His parents were deeply disappointed by the divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/felsenthal-newhouse.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=Citizen Newhouse|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he married Victoria Carrington Benedict de Ramel, who survived him.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; His grandson, S.I.

'''Shape grammars''' in computation are a specific class of [[production system (computer science)|production system]]s that generate geometric shapes. Typically, shapes are 2- or 3-dimensional, thus shape grammars are a way to study 2- and 3-dimensional languages. The foundation of shape grammars has been defined in a seminal article by [[George Stiny]] and [[James Gips]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="stiny1972"&gt;Stiny, G. &amp; Gips, J. (1972). Shape grammars and the generative specification of painting and sculpture. In Information Processing 71, 1460–1465. North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A shape grammar consists of ''shape rules'' and a ''generation engine'' that selects and processes rules. A shape rule defines how an existing (part of a) shape can be transformed. A shape rule consists of two parts separated by an arrow pointing from left to right. The part left of the arrow is termed the ''Left-Hand Side'' (LHS). It depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker. The part right of the arrow is termed the ''Right-Hand Side'' (RHS). It depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.

A shape grammar minimally consists of three shape rules: a ''start rule'', at least one transformation rule, and a ''termination rule''. The start rule is necessary to start the shape generation process. The termination rule is necessary to make the shape generation process stop. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker. Shape grammars differ from Chomsky grammars a major respect: the production rules may be applied serially (as with Chomsky grammars) or in parallel (not allowed in [[Chomsky hierarchy|Chomsky grammars]]), similar to the way "productions" are done in [[L-System]]s.

A shape grammar system additionally has a working area where the created geometry is displayed. The generation engine checks the existing geometry, often referred to as ''Current Working Shape'' (CWS), for conditions that match the LHS of the shape rules. Shape rules with matching LHS are eligible for use. If more than one rule applies, the generation engine has to choose which rule to apply. In the alternative scenario, the engine first chooses one of the grammar rules and then tries to find all matches of the LHS of this rule in the CWS. If there are several matches, the engine can (depending on its configuration/implementation)
*apply the rule to all matches in parallel, 
*apply the rule to all matches serially (which might lead to inconsistencies) or 
*choose one of the detected matches and apply the rule to only this match.

Shape grammars are most useful when confined to a small, well-defined generation problem such as housing layouts and structure refinement. Because shape rules typically are defined on small shapes, a shape grammar can quickly contain a lot of rules. The palladian villas shape grammar presented by William Mitchell&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. (1990). The Logic of Architecture. MIT Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; for example contains 69 rules, that are applied throughout eight stages.

'''Parametric shape grammars''' are an extension of shape grammars.&lt;ref&gt;Stiny, G. (1980). Introduction to shape and shape grammars. Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 7(3), 343-351.&lt;/ref&gt; The new shape in the RHS of the shape rule is defined by [[parameter]]s so that it can take into account more of the context of the already existing shapes. This typically affects internal proportions of the new shape so that a greater variety of forms can be created. In this way, attempts are made to make shape grammars respond to structural conditions, for example the width of beams in roof structures which depends on span.

Despite their popularity and applicability in academic circles, shape grammars have not found widespread use in generic [[Computer Aided Design]] applications.

==Applications==
Shape grammars were originally presented for painting and sculpture&lt;ref name="stiny1972" /&gt; but have been studied in particular in architecture ([[computer-aided architectural design]]), as they provide a formalism to create new designs. Other important domains shape grammars have been applied in are decorative arts, industrial design and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Cagan, J. (2001).

{{Emotion}}
'''Social rejection''' occurs when an individual is deliberately excluded from a [[interpersonal relationship|social relationship]] or [[social interaction]]. The topic includes ''interpersonal rejection'' (or peer rejection), ''romantic rejection'' and ''familial estrangement''. A person can be rejected by individuals or an entire group of people. Furthermore, rejection can be either ''active'', by [[bullying]], [[teasing]], or ridiculing, or ''[[passive-aggressive behaviour|passive]]'', by ignoring a person, or giving the "[[silent treatment]]". The experience of being rejected is [[subjectivity|subjective]] for the recipient, and it can be [[perception|perceived]] when it is not actually present. The word [[ostracism]] is often used for the process (in [[Ancient Greece]] ostracism was voting into temporary exile).{{failed verification|date=February 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;ostracize. Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ostracize (accessed: November 17, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[humans]] are [[society|social]] beings, some level of rejection is an inevitable part of life. Nevertheless, rejection can become a problem when it is prolonged or consistent, when the relationship is important, or when the individual is highly sensitive to rejection. Rejection by an entire [[group (sociology)|group]] of people can have especially negative effects, particularly when it results in [[social isolation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Kipling D. |author2=Joseph P.

The experience of rejection can lead to a number of adverse psychological consequences such as [[loneliness]], low [[self-esteem]], [[aggression]], and [[clinical depression|depression]].&lt;ref name="McDougall, P. 2001 pp. 213-247"&gt;McDougall, P., Hymel, S., Vaillancourt, T., &amp; Mercer, L. (2001). The consequences of childhood rejection. In M. R. Leary (Ed.), ''Interpersonal rejection.'' (pp. 213-247). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also lead to feelings of insecurity and a heightened sensitivity to future rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richman|first=Laura Smart|last2=Leary|first2=Mark R.|date=April 2009|title=Reactions to Discrimination, Stigmatization, Ostracism, and Other Forms of Interpersonal Rejection|journal=Psychological Review|volume=116|issue=2|pages=365–383|doi=10.1037/a0015250|issn=0033-295X|pmc=2763620|pmid=19348546|hdl=10161/11810}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Need for acceptance==

Rejection may be emotionally painful because of the social nature of human beings and the need of social interaction between other humans is essential. [[Abraham Maslow]] and other theorists have suggested that the need for love and [[belongingness]] is a fundamental human [[motivation]].&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. H. (1954). ''Motivation and personality''. New York, NY: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maslow, all humans, even [[introvert]]s, need to be able to give and receive affection to be psychologically healthy.

Psychologists believe that simple contact or social interaction with others is not enough to fulfill this need. Instead, people have a strong motivational drive to form and maintain caring interpersonal relationships. People need both stable relationships and satisfying interactions with the people in those relationships. If either of these two ingredients is missing, people will begin to feel lonely and unhappy.&lt;ref name="pmid7777651"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Baumeister RF, Leary MR | title=The need to belong: desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation | journal=Psychol Bull | year= 1995 | volume= 117 | issue= 3 | pages= 497–529 | pmid=7777651 | doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497| pmc= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, rejection is a significant threat. In fact, the majority of human [[anxiety|anxieties]] appear to reflect concerns over [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Tice | first2 = D. M. | year = 1990 | title = Anxiety and social exclusion | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 165–195 | doi=10.1521/jscp.1990.9.2.165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a member of a group is also important for [[social identity]], which is a key component of the [[self-concept]]. Mark Leary of Duke University has suggested that the main purpose of [[self-esteem]] is to monitor social relations and detect social rejection. In this view, self-esteem is a [[sociometer]] which activates negative emotions when signs of exclusion appear.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R., Downs, D. L., (1995). Interpersonal functions of the self-esteem motive: The self-esteem system as a sociometer. In M. H. Kernis, ''Efficacy, agency, and self-esteem''. New York, NY: Plenum Press, pp. 123-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social psychology (psychology)|Social psychological]] research confirms the motivational basis of the need for acceptance. Specifically, fear of rejection leads to [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] to [[peer pressure]] (sometimes called normative influence), and [[social psychology (psychology)|compliance]] to the demands of others. Our need for affiliation and social interaction appears to be particularly strong when we are under stress.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==In childhood==

Peer rejection has been measured using [[sociometry]] and other rating methods. Studies typically show that some children are popular, receiving generally high ratings, many children are in the middle, with moderate ratings, and a minority of children are rejected, showing generally low ratings. One measure of rejection asks children to list peers they like and dislike. Rejected children receive few "like" nominations and many "dislike" nominations. Children classified as ''neglected'' receive few nominations of either type.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

According to Karen Bierman of Pennsylvania State University, most children who are rejected by their peers display one or more of the following behavior patterns:
#Low rates of [[altruism|prosocial]] behavior, e.g. taking turns, sharing.
#High rates of [[aggression|aggressive]] or disruptive behavior.
#High rates of inattentive, immature, or [[Impulsivity|impulsive]] behavior.
#High rates of [[social anxiety]].

Bierman states that well-liked children show [[social skills|social savvy]] and know when and how to join play groups. Children who are at risk for rejection are more likely to barge in disruptively, or hang back without joining at all. Aggressive children who are athletic or have good social skills are likely to be accepted by peers, and they may become ringleaders in the harassment of less skilled children. Minority children, children with disabilities, or children who have unusual characteristics or behavior may face greater risks of rejection. Depending on the norms of the peer group, sometimes even minor differences among children lead to rejection or neglect. Children who are less outgoing or simply prefer solitary play are less likely to be rejected than children who are socially inhibited and show signs of insecurity or anxiety.&lt;ref name="Bierman, K. L. 2003"&gt;Bierman, K. L. (2003). ''Peer rejection: Developmental processes and intervention strategies''. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bullying on Instituto Regional Federico Errázuriz (IRFE) in March 5, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rejected children are more likely to be bullied at school and on playgrounds.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}]]

Peer rejection, once established, tends to be stable over time, and thus difficult for a child to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Cillessen, A., Bukowski, W. M., &amp; Haselager, G. (2000). ''Stability of sociometric categories''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that active rejection is more stable, more harmful, and more likely to persist after a child transfers to another school, than simple neglect.&lt;ref name="Bierman, K. L. 2003"/&gt; One reason for this is that peer groups establish reputational biases that act as [[stereotype]]s and influence subsequent social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hymel, S., Wagner, E., &amp; Butler, L. J. (1990). Reputational bias: View from the peer group. In S. R. Asher, &amp; J. D. Coie, (Eds.). ''Peer rejection in childhood''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when rejected and popular children show similar behavior and accomplishments, popular children are treated much more favorably.

Rejected children are likely to have lower [[self-esteem]], and to be at greater risk for ''internalizing'' problems like depression.&lt;ref name="McDougall, P. 2001 pp. 213-247"/&gt; Some rejected children display ''externalizing'' behavior and show [[aggression]] rather than depression. The research is largely correlational, but there is evidence of reciprocal effects. This means that children with problems are more likely to be rejected, and this rejection then leads to even greater problems for them. Chronic peer rejection may lead to a negative developmental cycle that worsens with time.&lt;ref&gt;Coie, J. D. (1990). Toward a theory of peer rejection. In S. R. Asher &amp; J. D. Coie (Eds). ''Peer rejection in childhood'' (pp. 365-401). Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejected children are more likely to be [[bullying|bullied]] and to have fewer friends than popular children, but these conditions are not always present. For example, some popular children do not have close friends, whereas some rejected children do. Peer rejection is believed to be less damaging for children with at least one close friend.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

An analysis of 15 [[school shootings]] between 1995 and 2001 found that peer rejection was present in all but two of the cases (87%). The documented rejection experiences included both acute and chronic rejection and frequently took the form of ostracism, bullying, and romantic rejection. The authors stated that although it is likely that the rejection experiences contributed to the school shootings, other factors were also present, such as depression, poor impulse control, and other psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leary | first1 = M.

There are programs available for helping children who suffer from social rejection. One large scale review of 79 controlled studies found that social skills training is very effective (''r'' = .40 effect size), with a 70% success rate, compared to 30% success in control groups. There was a decline in effectiveness over time, however, with follow-up studies showing a somewhat smaller effect size (''r'' = .35).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = B. H. | year = 1992 | title = Didactic methods for enhancing children's peer relations: A quantitative review | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 363–382 | doi=10.1016/0272-7358(92)90142-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the laboratory==

Laboratory research has found that even short-term rejection from strangers can have powerful (if temporary) effects on an individual. In several social psychology [[experiment]]s, people chosen at random to receive messages of social exclusion become more aggressive, more willing to cheat, less willing to help others, and more likely to pursue short-term over long-term goals. Rejection appears to lead very rapidly to self-defeating and antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name="pmid12219857"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Twenge JM, Catanese KR, Baumeister RF | title=Social exclusion causes self-defeating behavior | journal=J Pers Soc Psychol | year= 2002 | volume= 83 | issue= 3 | pages= 606–15 | pmid=12219857 | doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.83.3.606| pmc= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also investigated how the brain responds to social rejection. One study found that the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]] is active when people are experiencing both physical pain and "social pain," in response to social rejection.&lt;ref name="pmid14551436"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Eisenberger NI, Lieberman MD, Williams KD | title=Does rejection hurt? An FMRI study of social exclusion | journal=Science | year= 2003 | volume= 302 | issue= 5643 | pages= 290–2 | doi=10.1126/science.1089134 | pmc= | pmid=14551436  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent experiment, also using [[MRI|fMRI]] neuroimaging, found that three regions become active when people are exposed to images depicting rejection themes. These areas are the posterior [[cingulate]], the [[parahippocampal gyrus]], and the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. Furthermore, individuals who are high in rejection sensitivity (see below) show less activity in the left [[prefrontal cortex]] and the right dorsal [[superior frontal gyrus]], which may indicate less ability to regulate emotional responses to rejection.&lt;ref name="pmid17536965"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kross E, Egner T, Ochsner K, Hirsch J, Downey G | title=Neural dynamics of rejection sensitivity | journal=J Cogn Neurosci | year= 2007 | volume= 19 | issue= 6 | pages= 945–56 | pmid=17536965 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2007.19.6.945 | pmc= | url= | citeseerx=10.1.1.386.718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent experiment at the University of California at Berkeley found that individuals with a combination of low [[self-esteem]] and low attentional control are more likely to exhibit eye-blink [[startle response]]s while viewing rejection themed images.&lt;ref name="pmid17894606"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gyurak A, Ayduk O | title=Defensive physiological reactions to rejection: the effect of self-esteem and attentional control on startle responses | journal=Psychol Sci | year= 2007 | volume= 18 | issue= 10 | pages= 886–92 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01996.x | pmc= 4175371| pmid=17894606  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that people who feel bad about themselves are especially vulnerable to rejection, but that people can also control and regulate their emotional reactions.

A study at Miami University indicated that individuals who recently experienced social rejection were better than both accepted and control participants in their ability to discriminate between real and fake smiles. Though both accepted and control participants were better than chance (they did not differ from each other), rejected participants were much better at this task, nearing 80% accuracy.&lt;ref name="pmid19000206"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bernstein MJ, Young SG, Brown CM, Sacco DF, Claypool HM | title=Adaptive responses to social exclusion: social rejection improves detection of real and fake smiles | journal=Psychol Sci | year= 2008 | volume= 19 | issue= 10 | pages= 981–3 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02187.x | pmc= | pmid=19000206  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study is noteworthy in that it is one of the few cases of a positive or adaptive consequence of social rejection.

=== Ball toss / cyberball experiments ===
A common experimental technique is the "ball toss" paradigm, which was developed by Kip Williams and his colleagues at Purdue University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = K. D. | last2 = Sommer | first2 = K. L. | year = 1997 | title = Social ostracism by one's coworkers: Does rejection lead to loafing or compensation? | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 23 | issue = 7| pages = 693–706 | doi=10.1177/0146167297237003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure involves a group of three people tossing a ball back and forth. Unbeknownst to the actual participant, two members of the group are working for the experimenter and following a pre-arranged script. In a typical experiment, half of the subjects will be excluded from the activity after a few tosses and never get the ball again. Only a few minutes of this treatment are sufficient to produce negative [[emotion]]s in the target, including anger and sadness. This effect occurs regardless of self-esteem and other personality differences.

[[Gender differences]] have been found in these experiments. In one study, women showed greater nonverbal engagement whereas men disengaged faster and showed face-saving techniques, such as pretending to be uninterested. The researchers concluded that women seek to regain a sense of belonging whereas men are more interested in regaining self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, K. D. &amp; Zadro, L. (2001). Ostracism. In M. R. Leary (Ed.), ''Interpersonal rejection''. (pp. 21-53). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A computerized version of the task known as "cyberball" has also been developed and leads to similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zadro|first=Lisa|author2=Williams, Kipling D |author3=Richardson, Rick |title=How low can you go? Ostracism by a computer is sufficient to lower self-reported levels of belonging, control, self-esteem, and meaningful existence|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=30 June 2004|volume=40|issue=4|pages=560–567|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyberball is a virtual ball toss game where the participant is led to believe they are playing with two other participants sitting at computers elsewhere who can toss the ball to either player.  The participant is included in the game for the first few minutes, but then excluded by the other players for the remaining three minutes.  This simple and short time period of ostracism has been found to produce significant increases to self-reported levels of anger and sadness, as well as lowering levels of the four needs.  These effects have been found even when the participant is ostracised by out-group members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=A|author2=Williams, K |title=R U There? Effects of ostracism by cell phone messages|journal=Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice|year=2004|volume=8|issue=4|pages=291–301|doi=10.1037/1089-2699.8.4.291|citeseerx=10.1.1.463.6556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Kipling|author2=Cheung, C. |author3=Choi, W. |title=CyberOstracism: Effects of being ignored over the internet|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2000|volume=79|issue=5|pages=748–762|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.748}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the out-group member is identified as a despised person such as someone in the [[Ku Klux Klan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonsalkorale|first=K|author2=Williams, K |title=The KKK won't let play: Ostracism even by a despised outgroup hurts|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2007|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1176–1186|doi=10.1002/ejsp.392}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they know the source of the ostracism is just a computer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zadro|first=Lisa|author2=Williams, K |author3=Richardson, R |title=How low can you go? Ostracism by a computer is sufficient to lower self-reported levels of belonging, control, self-esteem and meaningful existence|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|issue=4|pages=560–567|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even when being ostracised means they will be financially rewarded and being included would incur a financial cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Beest|first=Ilja|author2=Williams, K |title=When inclusion costs and ostracism pays, ostracism still hurts|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=2|pages=213–220|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.03.005 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People feel rejected even when they know they are playing only against the computer. A recent set of experiments using cyberball demonstrated that rejection impairs will power or [[ego depletion|self-regulation]]. Specifically, people who are rejected are more likely to eat cookies and less likely to drink an unpleasant tasting beverage that they are told is good for them. These experiments also showed that the negative effects of rejection last longer in individuals who are high in [[social anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oaten | first1 = M. | last2 = Williams | first2 = K. D. | last3 = Jones | first3 = A. | last4 = Zadro | first4 = L. | year = 2008 | title = The effects of ostracism on self-regulation in the socially anxious | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 5| pages = 471–504| doi=10.1521/jscp.2008.27.5.471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology of ostracism ==
Most of the research on the psychology of [[ostracism]] has been conducted by the social psychologist Kip Williams.  He and his colleagues have devised a model of ostracism  which provides a framework to show the complexity in the varieties of ostracism and the processes of its effects.  There he theorises that ostracism can potentially be so harmful that we have evolved an efficient warning system to immediately detect and respond to it.&lt;ref name="Williams 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Kipling D.|title=Ostracism : the power of silence|year=2002|publisher=Guilford|location=New York|isbn=978-1-57230-831-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leary|first=edited by Mark R.|title=Interpersonal rejection|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-513015-7|pages=21–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the animal kingdom as well as in primitive human societies, ostracism can lead to death due to the lack of protection benefits and access to sufficient food resources from the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruter|first=M|author2=Masters, R |title=Ostracism as a social and biological phenomenon: An introduction|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|year=1986|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=149–158|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(86)90043-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Living apart from the whole of society also means not having a mate, so being able to detect ostracism would be a highly adaptive response to ensure survival and continuation of the genetic line.

It is proposed that ostracism uniquely poses a threat to four [[fundamental human needs]]; the need to belong, the need for control in social situations, the need to maintain high levels of self-esteem, and the need to have a sense of a meaningful existence.&lt;ref name="Williams 2002"/&gt;  A threat to these needs produces psychological distress and pain.  Thus, people are motivated to remove this pain with behaviours aimed at reducing the likelihood of others ostracising them any further and increasing their inclusionary status.

=== Popularity Resurgence ===
There has been recent research into the function of popularity on development, specifically how a transition from ostracization to popularity can potentially reverse the deleterious effects of being socially ostracized.  While various theories have been put forth regarding what skills or attributes confer an advantage at obtaining popularity, it appears that individuals who were once popular and subsequently experienced a transient ostracization are often able to employ the same skills that led to their initial popularity to bring about a popularity resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;{https://www.coursera.org/lecture/popularity/what-social-behaviors-make-people-popular-so-quickly-l0ddb}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic==

In contrast to the study of childhood rejection, which primarily examines rejection by a group of peers, some researchers focus on the phenomenon of a single individual rejecting another in the context of a romantic relationship. In both teenagers and adults, ''romantic rejection'' occurs when a person refuses the [[courtship|romantic advances]] of another, ignores/avoids or is repulsed by someone who is romantically interested in them, or [[unilaterally]] ends an existing [[intimate relationship|relationship]]. The state of [[unrequited love]] is a common experience in youth, but mutual love becomes more typical as people get older.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R. F. 2001 pp. 55-72"&gt;Baumeister, R. F. &amp; Dhavale, D. (2001). Two sides of romantic rejection. In M. R. Leary (Ed.), ''Interpersonal rejection''. (pp. 55-72). New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romantic rejection is a painful, [[emotional]] experience that appears to trigger a response in the [[caudate nucleus]] of the brain, and associated [[dopamine]] and [[cortisol]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, H. (2006) Lost Love: The Nature of romantic rejection, In Cut Loose: (mostly) midlife and older women on the end of (mostly) long-term relationships. Nan Bauer-Maglin (Ed.) New Jersey: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectively, rejected individuals experience a range of negative emotions, including [[frustration]], intense [[anger]], [[jealousy]], [[hate]], and eventually, [[resignation]], [[despair]], and possible long-term [[major depressive disorder|depression]].

==Rejection sensitivity==
{{See also|borderline personality disorder}}
[[Karen Horney]] was the first theorist to discuss the phenomenon of ''rejection sensitivity''.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, G. (2008). The disregulating effect of social threat in people with borderline personality disorder. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Feb. 7-9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that it is a component of the [[neuroticism|neurotic]] personality, and that it is a tendency to feel deep anxiety and humiliation at the slightest rebuff. Simply being made to wait, for example, could be viewed as a rejection and met with extreme anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Horney, K. (1937). ''The neurotic personality of our time''. New York: W. W.

[[Albert Mehrabian]] developed an early questionnaire measure of rejection sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mehrabian | first1 = A | year = 1976 | title = Questionnaire measures of affiliative tendency and sensitivity to rejection | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 199–209 | doi=10.2466/pr0.1976.38.1.199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehrabian suggested that sensitive individuals are reluctant to express opinions, tend to avoid arguments or controversial discussions, are reluctant to make requests or impose on others, are easily hurt by negative feedback from others, and tend to rely too much on familiar others and situations so as to avoid rejection.

A more recent (1996) definition of rejection sensitivity is the tendency to "anxiously expect, readily perceive, and overreact" to social rejection.&lt;ref name="pmid8667172"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Downey G, Feldman SI |title=Implications of rejection sensitivity for intimate relationships |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |url=http://www.ffri.uniri.hr/~ibrdar/komunikacija/seminari/Downey,%201996%20-%20Rejection%20Sensitivity%20for%20intimate%20relationsh.pdf |year=1996 |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=1327–43 |pmid=8667172 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.6.1327 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731044210/http://www.ffri.uniri.hr/~ibrdar/komunikacija/seminari/Downey,%201996%20-%20Rejection%20Sensitivity%20for%20intimate%20relationsh.pdf |archivedate=July 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People differ in their readiness to perceive and react to rejection.&lt;ref name="pmid8667172"/&gt; The causes of individual differences in rejection sensitivity are not well understood.

==Health==

Social rejection has a large effect on a person's [[health]].  [[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]] and [[Mark Leary|Leary]] originally suggested that an unsatisfied need to belong would inevitably lead to problems in behavior as well as [[mental health|mental]] and physical health.&lt;ref name="pmid7777651" /&gt;  Corroboration of these assumptions about behavior deficits were seen by [[John Bowlby]] in his research.&lt;ref name =  "Bowlby, 1969" &gt;Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and loss: Vol. 1. Attachment. New York:Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have found that being socially rejected leads to  an increase in levels of [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name =  " Barden, Garber, Leiman, Ford, and Masters (1985)" &gt;Barden.

Overall, experiments show that those who have been rejected will suffer from more negative emotions and have fewer positive emotions than those who have been accepted or those who were in neutral or control conditions.&lt;ref name =  "Blackhart, Nelson, Knowles, &amp; Baumeister (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackhart | first1 = G.

They also found that those patients who were more sensitive to rejection died  from the disease an average of 2 years earlier than their non-rejection sensitive counterparts.&lt;ref name =  "Cole, Kemeny, &amp; Taylor (1997)" /&gt;

Other aspects of health are also affected by rejection. Both [[systolic blood pressure|systolic]] and [[diastolic blood pressure]] increase upon imagining a rejection scenario.&lt;ref name =  "Sommer et al., 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sommer | first1 = K.

==In fiction, film and art==

Artistic depictions of rejection occur in a variety of art forms. One example of rejection in art is [[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture]] of the Greek deity, Apollo. In this work, the mythical nymph, Daphne, depicts the act of rejection. Apollo had been filled with passion for Daphne, but she repeatedly rejected his advances. The sculpture portrays the moment when Daphne cries out for safety from Apollo and as a result is transformed into a laurel tree. Apollo has been defeated and turns away, rejected.

Depictions of rejection also occur in film. One genre of film that most frequently depicts rejection is romantic comedies. In the film ''[[He's Just Not That Into You (film)|He's Just Not That Into You]]'', the main characters deal with the challenges of reading and misreading human behavior. This presents a fear of rejection in romantic relationships as reflected in this quote by the character Mary, "And now you have to go around checking all these different portals just to get rejected by seven different technologies. It's exhausting."&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1001508|He's Just Not That Into You}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social rejection is also depicted in theatrical plays and musicals. For example, the film ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' shares the story of Tracy Turnblad, an overweight 15-year-old dancer set in the 1960s. Tracy and her mother are faced with overcoming society's expectations regarding weight and physical appearances.

'''State v. Stone''' is a popular [[Mock Trial|mock trial]] case published by the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]].  Set in the fictional town of "Nita City", the case is about a man named James Stone who is charged with the [[rape]] of a 21-year-old college student named Marilyn Miller.

== Facts of the Case ==

On a December afternoon in Nita City, the police receive a call from a 21-year-old college student named Marilyn Miller, who explains that a man broke into her apartment and raped her.  Miller is taken in for medical treatment, which confirms forcible rape, and on the ride back to her apartment she tells the police officer that she remembers seeing her attacker before.  Miller explains that the previous night, she was at a bar called "Rocco's" where she had an encounter with a twenty-something male who grabbed her hand and said "you need some loving."  She tells the officer that this man was the one who attacked her.

Police find a small blue book in Marilyn Miller's apartment, which they trace to a 28-year-old man with a criminal record named James Stone.  The book was a notebook used and carried around by Stone.  Stone is subsequently arrested; at his residence, police find clothing matching Miller's description of what the attacker wore.  The police show Miss Miller a series of photographs, one of which is Stone's, asking if she can identify her attacker.  Miller states that she thinks the photograph of Stone is her attacker, but wants to see him in person to be sure.  A police officer then takes her to James Stone's arraignment, where he is escorted before the judge in the courtroom.  Upon seeing James Stone, Marilyn Miller confirms that he was the one who attacked her.

James Stone admits that he was the one said "you need some loving" to Marilyn Miller at Rocco's the previous night, but he denies that he raped her, and insists that he lost his blue book at the bar.  James Stone's friends, Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsay, testify for him as alibi witnesses, saying that they were with Stone at the Nita University cafeteria around the time the attack took place.  James Stone also insists that he is happily married, though some evidence suggests that he was unhappy in his relationship with his wife...and that he had a rather strong sexual desire.

=== Important facts tending to incriminate James Stone ===

* Marilyn Miller identified Stone as her attacker.
* Stone's blue notebook was found at Miller's apartment.
* Stone had clothing matching the description of the attacker given by Miller, including a red bandana that Miller said her attacker wore over his face.
* Stone has a criminal record.

=== Common defenses to these ===

* Marilyn Miller didn't identify Stone as her attacker until the ride back to her apartment, which was after she had been given medication.
* Stone claims he lost the blue book at Rocco's and that she must have taken it home with her.  A waitress from Rocco's testifies that she saw James Stone and his friends searching for something at the end of the night.  However, they never told her at the time what they were searching for.
* The clothing worn by the attacker was not particularly uncommon for a person to have.
* Stone's past criminal record involves a burglary and an incident where he drove the getaway car in an armed robbery; nothing on the order of rape.

== Witnesses ==

There are a total of ten witness characters in the case.

=== Witnesses for the State ===

'''Marilyn Miller.'''  The woman who accuses James Stone of raping her.

'''Detective Wasilewski.'''  The detective who led the investigation of the rape.

'''Dr. Madden.'''  The OB/GYN who treated Marilyn Miller.

'''Diana Samuels.'''  A woman with whom James Stone was having an affair.  Her note to her therapist suggests that Stone had very strong sexual urges.

'''Officer Pace.'''  The police officer who responded to the rape call.

=== Witnesses for the Defense ===

'''James Stone.'''  The defendant.

'''Florence Stone.'''  James Stone's wife, who defends his good and moral character.

'''Edward Lindsey.'''  A friend of Stones, who claims he was with him around the time of the rape.

'''Thomas Mitchell.'''  Another friend of stones who also claims to have been with him around the time of the rape.

'''Esther Boothe.'''  A waitress who testifies that she saw James Stone and his friends searching for something before they left Rocco's on the night before the rape.

== Aspects of the Case ==

Like most cases designed for mock trials, ''State v. Stone'' has many nuances.

=== Character of James Stone ===

James Stone is designed to be a "scum of the earth" type of character, a man with a multiple felony convictions who is cheating on his wife, and who would accost a young girl in a bar and tell her "you need some loving."  Indeed, his very name "Stone" seems to be something of a character pun, much like his counterpart "John Diamond", the umblemished police officer and former Marine who is the defendant in the NITA case ''State v. Diamond.''  An important part of the defense's case is the rehabilitation of Stone's character, or alternatively, keeping this out of the case.

=== The Blue Book ===

There is no dispute that the blue notebook belonging to James Stone was found inside Marilyn Miller's apartment.  According to the prosecution's theory of the case, Stone accidentally dropped it there when he raped Miller.

The defense is thus shouldered with offering an alternate explanation for how the book ended up in Miller's apartment.  A popular argument is that she somehow accidentally took it home with her from Rocco's the previous night; perhaps it was dropped in her purse when Stone accosted her, or that she took it back thinking it was hers, and forgot after being given medication after her rape.

=== Marilyn Miller's Apartment ===

An important hole for the prosecution to fill is how James Stone found Marilyn Miller's apartment.  Miller lived in a multiple-dwelling residence, with doors leading to two different apartments inside of a main door (one upstairs, one downstairs).  Miller testified that she heard a crash and that the next thing she knew, her rapist was standing in the doorway.  Her rapist thus must have known which apartment inside the building was hers.

One theory might be that James Stone followed Miller home, and after she entered her apartment building, saw her turn on the light  through the window - indicating that Marilyn lived in the upstairs apartment in the building.

=== Witness Credibility versus Alibi Strength ===

Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsey both testify that they were with James Stone at a cafeteria around noon on the day of the rape.  The victim call and reported the rape at 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., meaning that Mitchell's testimony still leaves time, albeit not much, for James Stone to have potentially committed the rape.

Both sides have something of a dilemma with Mitchell and Lindsey because, on one hand, if their testimony still leaves room for Stone to commit the crime, then this makes their testimony more reliable.  If Thomas Mitchell and Edward Lindsey were lying to protect Stone and give him an alibi, then logically, they would alibi him for the entire time period.  The fact that their testimony doesn't completely exonerate Stone suggests that Mitchell and Lindsey are telling the truth.  On the other hand, if their alibi is imperfect, then it still leaves room for the crime to be committed.

Both sides should ideally argue for their version of the facts under both potential sets of facts.  In other words, the prosecution should ideally argue that, either Mitchell and Lindsey are being untruthful - meaning that their testimony doesn't exonerate Stone - or that they are being truthful, but the alibi they present is imperfect.

=== DNA Evidence ===

''State v. Stone'' was written before [[DNA]] was widely used as evidence, and there is no discussion of any attempt to recover genetic material from the victim in the original publication.  Some courses and competitions may add the fact that no material containing DNA was discovered or that the case should be considered as though genetic testing has not yet been developed.

'''Steve''' is an [[Atmospheric optics|atmospheric optical phenomenon]] which appears as a purple and green light ribbon in the sky, formally discovered in 2017 by [[aurora]] watchers from [[Alberta|Alberta, Canada]]. According to Eric Donovan's analysis of satellite data from the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Swarm (spacecraft)|Swarm]] mission, Steve is caused by a {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide ribbon of hot [[gas]]es at an altitude of {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}}, with a temperature of {{convert|3000|C|K F|abbr=on}} and flowing at a speed of {{convert|6|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}} (compared to {{convert|10|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} outside the ribbon). The phenomenon is not rare, but nobody had looked into it in detail prior to that.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/introducing-steve-a-newly-discovered-light-in-the-sky|title=Introducing Steve - a Newly Discovered Astronomical Phenomenon|last=McRae|first=Mike|date=24 April 2017|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/When_Swarm_met_Steve|title=When Swarm Met Steve|last=|first=|date=21 April 2017|work=ESA|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-08-kind-aurora.html|title=New kind of aurora is not an aurora at all|last=American Geophysical Union|first=|date=20 August  2018|work=Physorg.com|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, researchers determined that the phenomenon's [[skyglow]] was not associated with [[Precipitation|particle precipitation]] ([[electron]]s or [[ion]]s) and, as a result, could be generated in the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name="GRL-20180820" /&gt;

== Discovery and naming ==
The aurora watchers who first discovered Steve, members of a Facebook group called Alberta Aurora Chasers, initially attributed the phenomenon to a proton aurora and erroneously called them "proton arcs",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2017/04/Meet_Steve|title=Meet Steve|website=European Space Agency|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when physics professor Eric Donovan from the [[University of Calgary]] saw the pictures, he suspected that was not the case, because proton auroras are not visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39686055|title=Aurora photographers find new night sky lights and call them Steve|last=|first=|date=23 April 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he correlated the time and location of the phenomenon with [[Swarm (spacecraft)|Swarm]] satellite data, and Song Despins photo (not seen here) including GPS coordinates, the phenomenon was very clearly distinguished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the aurora watchers, photographer Chris Ratzlaff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://collegecandy.com/2017/04/27/steve-aurora-alberta-chasers-celestial-photos-full-story/|title=Amateur Sky-Watchers Discover Celestial Phenomenon, Name It 'Steve'|date=24 April 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the name "Steve" from [[Over the Hedge (film)|''Over the Hedge'']], an animated comedy movie from 2006, in which its characters chose that name for something unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-24/new-light-phenomenon-called-steve-by-aurora-watchers/8466234|title=New atmospheric phenomenon named Steve discovered by aurora watchers|last=|first=|date=24 April 2017|work=ABC News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reportage of the heretofore undescribed unusual "aurora" went [[viral phenomenon|viral]] as an example of [[citizen science]] on [[Aurorasaurus]].&lt;ref name="Twitter and Citizen science"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/Alaska-Science-Forum/citizen-science-meets-aurora |title=Citizen science meets the aurora |last=Rozell |first=Ned |date=2015-04-02 |website=University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="STEVE"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.aurorasaurus.org/?p=449 |title=7 Things to Know About "STEVE" |date=2017-03-14 |website=Aurorasaurus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scientist listening to Eric Donovan's presentation at the December, 2016, meeting of the American Geophysical Union suggested "Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement" as a [[backronym]] of STEVE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.googply.com/2017/04/24/introducing-steve-a-newly-discovered-astronomical-phenomenon/|title=Introducing Steve – a newly discovered astronomical phenomenon|date=2017-04-24|website=Googply News|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; one which has since been adopted by the team at [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] studying Steve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/03/steve-auroras-identified-plasma/|title=Meet ‘Steve,’ a Totally New Kind of Aurora|date=2018-03-14|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence and cause ==
Steve can be spotted closer to the [[equator]] than the aurora,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2018/mar/19/steve-mystery-purple-aura-rivals-northern-lights-alberta-canada-nasa|title='Steve': the mystery purple aurora that rivals the northern lights|last=Saner|first=Emine|date=2018-03-19|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of March 2018 has been observed in the United Kingdom, Canada, Alaska, northern U.S. states and New Zealand. Steve appears as a very narrow arc extending for hundreds or thousands of miles, aligned east-west. Steve generally lasts for 20 minutes to an hour. As of March 2018, Steve has only been spotted in the presence of an aurora. Steve was not observed from October 2016 to February 2017, or from October 2017 to February 2018, leading [[NASA]] to believe that Steve may only appear in certain seasons.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasa-needs-your-help-to-find-steve-and-heres-how|title=NASA Needs Your Help to Find Steve and Here's How|last=Garner|first=Rob|date=2018-03-14|work=NASA|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in March 2018 by Donovan, Ratzlaff, and other co-authors in the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Science Advances]]'' suggested that Steve accompanies a subauroral ion drift (SAID),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Donovan|first2=Eric|last3=Nishimura|first3=Yukitoshi|last4=Case|first4=Nathan A.|last5=Gillies|first5=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10105">[[File:SirTheodoreDeMayerne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sir Théodore de Mayerne]]
'''Sir Théodore Turquet de Mayerne''' (28 September 1573 &amp;ndash; 22 March 1655) was a  [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]]-born physician who treated kings of France and England and advanced the theories of [[Paracelsus]].
==The Young Doctor==
Mayerne was born in a [[Huguenot]] family in [[Geneve]], Republic of Geneva. His father was a [[Huguenot|Protestant French]] historian who had fled [[Lyon]] following the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] and his godfather was [[Theodore Beza]]. Mayerne's first wife was Marguerite de Boetslaer and they had three children.

Mayerne studied first in [[Geneve]] and later moved to the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Later he moved to [[Montpellier]] to study [[medicine]], graduated 1596 and received his doctorate in 1597. His dissertation defended the use of chemical remedies in medicine, under the guidance of [[Joseph du Chesne]]; this was the first intimation of his interest in Paracelsian theories. In May 1599, Mayerne joined [[Henri de Rohan]], a Huguenot nobleman very powerful in Brittany, on his grand tour of Europe, visiting Germany, Italy, Bohemia, the Netherlands, England, and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; During their visit to London in October 1600, Rohan and Mayerne were received by Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court, and in November 1600, when they reached [[Edinburgh]], they were received by King [[James VI]], before returning to France in early 1601.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his austere Calvinism, Mayerne greatly admired the many works of art and architecture he saw in his travels in Germany and Italy, especially liking the paintings of [[Albrecht Dürer]] and the ''[[Kunstkammer]]'' in Munich of curios kept by the [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Paris Years==
Mayerne moved to Paris, lecturer on [[anatomy]] and [[pharmacy]] and founded a [[medical practice]]. By that time he had begun to support the views of Paracelsus and used many chemical remedies. He kept detailed notes about his patients, among them Armand du Plessis, later [[Cardinal Richelieu]], whom he treated for [[gonorrhea]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, ''Europe's Physician'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1600 French [[royal physician]] [[Jean Ribit de la Rivière]] (1571–1605) sponsored him to become one of the personal physicians, physician in ordinary, of the king [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, « Paris, 1598 - 1601 »&lt;/ref&gt; His other pursuits were thwarted because he was not a Catholic and because most French physicians still followed the principles of [[Galen]]. In 1603 he tried to support his views to Medical Faculty of Paris, stating that his views were not opposed to Galenic and [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] principles.

Despite their opposition, he retained the favour of the King, who appointed him to travel with the [[Henri, Duc de Rohan|Duc de Rohan]] in his diplomatic missions to Germany and Italy. When the King intended to make Mayerne his first physician, the queen opposed the decision because Mayerne refused to convert to Catholicism. Mayerne continued in his lower post until 1606 when he sold it to another physician.

At this time he continued his association with du Chesne and the circle of [[Hermeticists]] that had grown up around him. These devotees of Paracelsus believed they were reviving the wisdom of the mythical pre-[[Platonism|Platonic]] natural philosophers - men known as the ''prisci theologi'' that included [[Zoroaster]] and [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. The [[alchemical]] nature of their experiments was greatly resented by Galenists at the [[University of Paris]].

In the same year he briefly visited England by invitation and met [[James I of England|James I]]. He became a physician of [[Anne of Denmark]] and was incorporated at [[Oxford]] on April 8, 1606. He probably spent the following years back in France.

==Life in England==
When Henri IV was murdered in 1610, Mayerne moved to England, again by invitation. In 1611 he became first physician of James I and his queen and also treated most members of the royal court, including Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] and [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. His inability to successfully treat those two individuals, together with his closeness to the scandal surrounding the murder of [[Thomas Overbury|Sir Thomas Overbury]] coloured his first years in England. Nevertheless, he was sometimes sent on diplomatic missions to France.

In 1616 Mayerne was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. He helped the [[Society of Apothecaries]] to obtain a [[royal charter]] separate from the Grocers and helped to found the [[Company of Distillers]]. King [[knighthood|knighted]] him in 1624. Next year he briefly visited Switzerland, where he had become Baron [[Aubonne, Switzerland|Aubonne]]. Mayerne retained his post as a first physician after the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1625.

He successfully championed the effort to produce the first official [[pharmacopoeia]], which would specify treatments that [[apothecaries]] should provide for specific ailments. In this he included chemical remedies, which were easier to introduce in Protestant England than in Catholic France.

In 1628 his wife died and in 1630 he married Elizabeth Joachimi. They had five children but only one daughter survived. At about this time he treated [[Oliver Cromwell]] for a variety of physical and emotional symptoms, including a severe depression. In response to [[the Plague of 1630]], he suggested the institution of a centralized 'Office of Health', with free royal hospitals, trained officials, and regulatory power.

During the [[English Civil War]] Mayerne kept a low profile in his practice in London and retained the favour of the parliament. After the [[execution of Charles I]] in 1649, he became nominal physician to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] but soon retired to [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].

Mayerne died at Chelsea on 22 March 1654 or 1655. He was buried in [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] with most of his family and his godson Sir Theodore des Vaux sponsored a monument for him. Des Vaux later published Mayerne's medical notes in the book ''Praxis Medica'' in 1690.

==Legacy==

Mayerne compiled the so-called 'de Mayerne manuscript' between 1620 and 1646 based on conversations with painters (and others). The manuscript includes contributions from [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[Daniël Mijtens|Mytens]], [[Paul van Somer I|Paul van Somer]], and [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen|Cornelius Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/cornelis-jonson-van-ceulen-i-portrait-of-5666153-details.aspx?pos=3&amp;intObjectID=5666153&amp;sid=&amp;page=4 Christies Auction Catalogue; lot notes, lot 45]&lt;/ref&gt; His estate included copious amount of medical manuscripts, including detailed notes about his patients, most of it in Latin and French; his patients ranged from [[John Donne]] to [[Oliver Cromwell]]. His papers are kept in the [[Royal College of Physicians]].

His influence on the administration of medicine - including the first suggestion of [[socialized medicine]] in England, and the standardisation of chemical cures, has been widely recognised.

His 'Paracelsian' outlook, which viewed the world as 'abounding in chemical secrets waiting to be exploited', led him to devise projects to enhance Scottish coal mines, to reopen lead mines in Europe and to monopolize oyster beds. He made [[chemistry|chemical]] and physical experiments, created [[pigment]]s and [[cosmetics]], introduced [[calomel]] to medical use and created ''black-wash'' (lotio nigra). It also led him to an interest in cooking, and he grew obese in later years.

In 1634, he wrote the introduction for and edited one of the first treatises ever published on Insects (usually attributed to [[Thomas Muffet]]), under the title ''Insectorum, sive minimorum animalium Theatrum: Olim ab Edoardo Wottono, Conrado Gesnero, Thomaque Pennio inchoatum: Tandem Tho. Moufeti Londinâtis operâ sumptibusque maximis concinnatum, auctum, perfectum: Et ad vivum expressis Iconibus suprà quingentis illustratum. Londini ex Officinâ typographicâ Thom. Cotes. Et venales extant apud Benjam. Allen, in diverticulo, quod Anglicè dicitur Popes-head Alley.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10665">'''Viral eukaryogenesis''' is the [[hypothesis]] that the [[cell nucleus]] of [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] life forms evolved from a large [[DNA virus]] in a form of [[Endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]] within a methanogenic [[archaea|archaeon]]. The virus later evolved into the eukaryotic nucleus by acquiring genes from the host genome and eventually usurping its role. The hypothesis was proposed by Philip Bell in 2001&lt;ref name="bell2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s002390010215 |year=2001 |author=Philip John Livingstone Bell|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=251–256 |title=Viral eukaryogenesis: Was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? |pmid=11523012|bibcode=2001JMolE..53..251L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained support{{vague|date=November 2015}} as large, complex DNA viruses (such as [[Mimivirus]]) capable of [[protein biosynthesis]] were discovered. Recent supporting evidence includes the discovery that, upon the infection of a bacterial cell, the giant bacteriophage [[201Phi2-1]] assembles a nucleus-like structure that segregates proteins according to function &lt;ref name="Chaikeeratisak"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.aal2130 |year=2017 |last1=Chaikeeratisak |first1=V |last2=Nguyen |first2=K |last3=Khanna |first3=K |last4=Brilot |first4=AF |last5=Erb |first5=ML |last6=Coker |first6=JKC |last7=Vavilina |first7=A |last8=Newton |first8=GL |last9=Buschauer |first9=R |last10=Pogliano |first10=K |last11=Villa |first11=E |last12=Agard |first12=DA |last13=Pogliano |first13=J |journal=Science |volume=355 |issue=6321 |pages=194-197 |title=Assembly of a nucleus-like structure during viral replication in bacteria |pmid=28082593|bibcode=2017Sci...355..194C }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis has inflamed the longstanding debate over whether viruses are living [[organisms]]. Many biologists do not consider viruses to be alive, but the hypothesis posits that viruses are the originators of the DNA genetic mechanism shared by all [[eukaryote]]s alive today (and possibly that of [[prokaryote]]s as well).&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt;

== Hypothesis ==
The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis posits that eukaryotes are composed of three ancestral elements: a viral component that became the modern nucleus; a prokaryotic cell (an [[Archaea|archaeon]] according to [[eocyte hypothesis]]) which donated the [[cytoplasm]] and cell membrane of modern cells; and another prokaryotic (bacterial) cell that, by [[endocytosis]], became the modern [[mitochondrion]] or [[chloroplast]]. 

In 2006, researchers suggested that the transition from [[RNA]] to [[DNA]] genomes first occurred in the viral world.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0510333103 |title=Three RNA cells for ribosomal lineages and three DNA viruses to replicate their genomes: A hypothesis for the origin of cellular domain |year=2006 |last1=Forterre |first1=Patrick |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=103 |issue=10 |pmid=16505372 |jstor=30048645 |bibcode=2006PNAS..103.3669F |pages=3669–74 |pmc=1450140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA-based virus may have provided storage for an ancient host that had previously used RNA to store its genetic information (such host is called ribocell or ribocyte).&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt; Viruses may initially have adopted DNA as a way to resist RNA-degrading [[enzyme]]s in the host cells. Hence, the contribution from such a new component may have been as significant as the contribution from [[chloroplast]]s or mitochondria. Following this hypothesis, archaea, [[bacteria]], and eukaryotes each obtained their DNA informational system from a different virus.&lt;ref name="pnas"/&gt; In the original paper it was also an [[RNA]] cell at the origin of eukaryotes, but eventually more complex, featuring [[Post-transcriptional modification|RNA processing]]. Although this is in contrast to nowadays more probable eocyte hypothesis, viruses seem to have contributed to the origin of all three domains of life ('out of virus hypothesis'). It has also been suggested that [[telomerase]] and [[telomeres]], key aspects of eukaryotic cell replication, have viral origins. Further, the viral origins of the modern eukaryotic nucleus may have relied on multiple [[infections]] of archaeal cells carrying bacterial mitochondrial precursors with [[Lysogenic cycle|lysogenic viruses]].&lt;ref name="witzany2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12304-008-9018-0 |title=The viral origins of telomeres and telomerases and their important role in eukaryogenesis and genome maintenance |year=2008 |last1=Witzany |first1=Guenther |journal=Biosemiotics |url=http://www.mitdenker.at/life/Telomeres.pdf |volume=1 |pages=191–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis depicts a model of eukaryotic evolution in which a virus, similar to a modern [[pox virus]], evolved into a nucleus via gene acquisition from existing bacterial and archaeal species. The lysogenic virus then became the information storage center for the cell, while the cell retained its capacities for gene translation and general function despite the viral genome's entry. Similarly, the bacterial species involved in this eukaryogenesis retained its capacity to produce energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] while also passing much of its genetic information into this new virus-nucleus organelle. It is hypothesized that the modern cell cycle, whereby [[mitosis]], meiosis, and sex occur in all eukaryotes, evolved because of the balances struck by viruses, which characteristically follow a pattern of tradeoff between infecting as many hosts as possible and killing an individual host through viral proliferation. Hypothetically, [[viral replication]] cycles may mirror those of [[plasmids]] and viral lysogens. However, this theory is controversial, and additional experimentation involving archaeal viruses is necessary, as they are probably the most evolutionarily similar to modern eukaryotic nuclei.&lt;ref name="bell2006"/&gt; 

The viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis points to the cell cycle of eukaryotes, particularly sex and [[meiosis]], as evidence.&lt;ref name="bell2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/jjtbi200605015 |year=2006 |author=Philip John Livingstone Bell|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=243 |issue=1 |pages=54–63 |title=Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251930600213X#}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the origins of DNA or reproduction in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells.

Eukaryotic nuclei are also capable of cytoplasmic replication. Some large viruses have their own DNA-directed [[RNA polymerase]].&lt;ref name="jean"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/gb-2006-7-6-110 |year=2006 |last1=Claverie |first1=Jean-Michel |journal=Genome Biology |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=110 |pmid=16787527 |title=Viruses take center stage in cellular evolution |pmc=1779534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transfers of "infectious" nuclei have been documented in many [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[red algae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1105/tpc.7.11.1899 |title=Fate of Parasite and Host Organelle DNA during Cellular Transformation of Red Algae by Their Parasites |year=1995 |last1=Goff |first1=Lynda J. |last2=Coleman |first2=Annette W. |author2-link = Annette W.

== Implications ==
A number of precepts in the theory are possible. For instance, a helical virus with a [[Lipid bilayer|bilipid]] [[Viral envelope|envelope]] bears a distinct resemblance to a highly simplified [[Cell nucleus|cellular nucleus]] (i.e., a DNA chromosome encapsulated within a lipid membrane). In theory, a large DNA virus could take control of a [[bacteria]]l or archaeal cell. Instead of replicating and destroying the host cell, it would remain within the cell, thus overcoming the tradeoff dilemma typically faced by viruses. With the virus in control of the host cell's molecular machinery, it would effectively become a functional nucleus. Through the processes of mitosis and [[cytokinesis]], the virus would thus recruit the entire cell as a symbiont—a new way to survive and proliferate.

The similarities between DNA viruses and nuclei can be taken as evidence either of viral eukaryogensis or of its converse, nuclear viriogenesis: that complex eukaryotic DNA viruses could have originated from infectious nuclei.&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt;

'''''We Have Never Been Modern''''' is a 1991 book by [[Bruno Latour]], originally published in French as ''Nous n'avons jamais été modernes : Essai d'anthropologie symétrique'' (English translation: 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Content==
The book is an "anthropology of science" that explores the dualistic distinction [[modernity]] makes between [[nature]] and [[society]]. [[Pre-modern]] peoples, argues Latour, made no such division. Contemporary matters  of public concern such as [[global warming]], the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and emerging [[biotechnologies]] mix politics, science, popular and specialist discourse to such a degree that a tidy nature/culture dualism is no longer possible. This inconsistency has given rise to [[post-modern]] and [[Anarcho-primitivism|anti-modern]] movements&lt;!--NOTE: the link to "Anarcho-primitivism" is only a rough and far from ideal fit to Latour's conception of "anti-modernism". Insert a better one if you can--&gt;. Latour attempts to reconnect the social and natural worlds by arguing that the modernist distinction between nature and culture never existed. He claims we must rework our thinking to conceive of a "Parliament of Things" wherein [[natural phenomena]], [[social phenomena]] and the [[discourse]] about them are not seen as separate objects to be studied by [[experts|specialist]]s, but as [[wikt:hybrid|hybrids]] made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The '''whale shark''' (''Rhincodon typus'') is a slow-moving, [[filter feeder|filter-feeding]] [[carpet shark]] and the largest known [[Extant taxon|extant]] fish [[species]]. The largest confirmed individual had a length of {{convert|12.65|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a weight of about {{convert|21.5|t|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian [[vertebrate]]. It is the sole member of the genus '''''Rhincodon''''' and the only extant member of the family '''Rhincodontidae''' which belongs to the subclass [[Elasmobranchii]] in the class [[Chondrichthyes]]. Before 1984 it was classified as ''Rhiniodon'' into Rhinodontidae.

The whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in the water below {{convert|21|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="iucn" /&gt; Modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years, but measurements have proven difficult.&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{cite web |last=Colman |first=J.

==Description==

[[File:Rhincodon typus teeth.jpg|thumb|left|Teeth]]

Whale sharks have a mouth that can be {{convert|1.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} wide, containing 300 to 350 rows of tiny teeth and 10 filter pads which it uses to [[filter feeder|filter feed]].&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web |last=Compagno |first=L.

The head is wide and flat with two small eyes at the front. Whale sharks are grey with a white belly. Their skin is marked with pale yellow spots and stripes which are unique to each individual. The whale shark has three prominent ridges along its sides.  Its skin can be up to {{convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The shark has a pair of [[dorsal fin]]s and [[pectoral fin]]s. Juveniles' tails have a larger upper fin than the lower fin, while the adult tail becomes semi[[lunate]]. The whale shark's [[spiracle]]s are just behind its eyes.

The whale shark is the largest non-[[cetacean]] animal in the world. The average size of adult whale sharks is estimated at {{convert|9.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|9|t|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "Wood"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gerald L. |last=Wood|title=The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats|url= https://books.google.com/?id=AWhFAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=whale+shark|pages = 139–141|year=1976|publisher=Guinness Superlatives|isbn=978-0-900424-60-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several specimens over {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length have been reported.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McClain CR, Balk MA, Benfield MC, Branch TA, Chen C, Cosgrove J, ((Dove ADM)), Gaskins LC, Helm RR, Hochberg FG, Lee FB, Marshall A, McMurray SE, Schanche C, Stone SN, Thaler AD|year=2015|title= Sizing ocean giants: patterns of intraspecific size variation in marine megafauna|journal= PeerJ |volume=3|pages=e715 |doi=10.7717/peerj.715|pmid=25649000|pmc=4304853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest verified specimen was caught on 11 November 1949, near [[Baba Island]], in [[Karachi]], Pakistan.

In a 1925 publication, [[Hugh McCormick Smith|Hugh M. Smith]] described a huge animal caught in a bamboo fish trap in Thailand in 1919. The shark was too heavy to pull ashore, but Smith estimated the shark was at least {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and weighed around 37 t.

The whale shark inhabits all tropical and warm-temperate seas.

==Reproduction==
Neither mating nor pupping of whale sharks has been observed.

==Diet==
[[File:Whale Shark 1 AdF.jpg|thumb|Whale shark [[filter feeder|filtering]] [[plankton]] in Maldives]]
[[File:Whale6.jpg|thumb|left|A whale shark in the Philippines with [[remora]]s]]
The whale shark is a [[filter feeder]] – one of only three known filter-feeding shark species (along with the [[basking shark]] and the [[megamouth shark]]). It feeds on [[plankton]] including [[copepods]], [[krill]], [[fish eggs]], [[Christmas Island red crab]] larvae &lt;ref name="Shark-cam captures ocean motion"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |date=17 November 2008 |title=Shark-cam captures ocean motion |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7727136.stm |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and small [[nekton]]ic life, such as small [[squid]] or [[fish]]. It also feeds on clouds of eggs during mass spawning of fish and corals.&lt;ref name=JurassicShark/&gt; The many rows of vestigial teeth play no role in feeding. Feeding occurs either by ram filtration, in which the animal opens its mouth and swims forward, pushing water and food into the mouth, or by active suction feeding, in which the animal opens and closes its mouth, sucking in volumes of water that are then expelled through the gills.  In both cases, the filter pads serve to separate food from water. These unique, black sieve-like structures are presumed to be modified gill rakers. Food separation in whale sharks is by [[cross-flow filtration]], in which the water travels nearly parallel to the filter pad surface, not perpendicularly through it, before passing to the outside, while denser food particles continue to the back of the throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Motta |first1=Philip J. |display-authors=etal |date=2010 |title=Feeding anatomy, filter-feeding rate, and diet of whale sharks ''Rhincodon typus'' during surface ram filter feeding off the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico |journal=Zoology |doi=10.1016/j.zool.2009.12.001 |pmid=20817493 |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=199–212 |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-srv%2Fnation%2Fpdfs%2FSharkfeedingpaper.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an extremely efficient filtration method that minimizes fouling of the filter pad surface. Whale sharks have been observed "coughing", presumably to clear a build-up of particles from the filter pads. Whale sharks migrate to feed and possibly to breed.&lt;ref name="fishbase"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RQBM"&gt;{{cite web |last=Martin |first=R. Aidan |title=Elasmo Research |publisher=ReefQuest |url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/d_filter_feeding.htm |accessdate=17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FLMNH"&gt;{{cite web |title=Whale shark |publisher=Ichthyology at the Florida Museum of Natural History |url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/Whaleshark/whaleshark.html |accessdate=17 September 2006|date=11 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whale shark is an active feeder, targeting concentrations of plankton or fish. It is able to ram filter feed or can gulp in a stationary position. This is in contrast to the passive feeding basking shark, which does not pump water. Instead, it swims to force water across its gills.&lt;ref name="fishbase"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RQBM" /&gt;

A juvenile whale shark is estimated to eat 21&amp;nbsp;kg (46 pounds) of plankton per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schmidt |first=Jennifer V. |date=4 December 2010 |title=Whale Sharks are BIG eaters! |publisher=The Shark Research Institute |url=http://www.sharks.org/blogs/science-blog/whale-sharks-are-big-eaters |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC program ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'' filmed a whale shark feeding on a school of small fish. The same documentary showed footage of a whale shark timing its arrival to coincide with the mass spawning of fish shoals and feeding on the resultant clouds of eggs and sperm.&lt;ref name=JurassicShark&gt;''Jurassic Shark'' (2000) documentary by Jacinth O'Donnell; broadcast on [[Discovery Channel]], 5 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Whale sharks are known to prey on a range of planktonic and small nektonic organisms that are spatiotemporally patchy. These include krill, crab larvae, jellyfish, sardines, anchovies, mackerels, small tunas, and squid. In ram filter feeding, the fish swims forward at constant speed with its mouth fully open, straining prey particles from the water by forward propulsion. This is also called  ‘passive feeding’, which usually occurs when prey is present at low density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Rhincodon_typus/|title=Rhincodon typus (whale shark)|website=Animal Diversity Web|access-date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, it is called ''butanding'' and ''balilan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oneocean.org/ambassadors/sharks/index.html Ocean Ambassadors – Sharks]. Oneocean.org. Retrieved 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The whale shark is featured on the reverse of the Philippine 100-peso bill. By law snorkelers must maintain a distance of four feet from the sharks and there is a fine and possible prison sentence for anyone who touches the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cannon |first=Marisa |date=21 July 2015 |title=Swimming with whale sharks in the Philippines |website=cnn.com |publisher=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/05/travel/whale-shark-oslob/index.html |accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whale shark is also featured on the latest 2015–2017 edition of the Maldivian 1000 [[rufiyaa]] banknote, along with the [[green turtle]].

== Etymology ==
The term 'WinOps' was coined at the [[London]] DevOps meetup held at [[Facebook]] in June 2015. As an amalgamation of Windows and DevOps, it represents the new emphasis on using existing DevOps methodologies in the traditionally less open-source Microsoft space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Prism_Digital/prism-digital-s-world-first-conference-61be015baf2a#.wvzw2c7lj|title=Prism Digital's world first conference|last=Digital|first=Prism|date=2015-10-16|website=Medium|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sammart.in/winops-conference-london-2/|title=WinOps Conference London #2|date=2016-05-26|website=Sam Martin|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community ==
Since the first WinOps conference in September 2015, there have been multiple meetups and a second conference which was held in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://skeltonthatcher.com/blog/winops-conf-2016-devops-ification-of-windows-server/|title=WinOps Conf 2016 - DevOps-ification of Windows Server - Skelton Thatcher Consulting|date=2016-05-28|website=Skelton Thatcher Consulting|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Prism_Digital/winops-conf-1b845b6a7296#.mlvpjobjp|title=WinOps Conf|last=Digital|first=Prism|date=2016-06-01|website=Medium|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WinOps meetup group has an active community with over 1,000 members. Their motto is "Windows in a DevOps World". They focus on shared experiences using Windows centred products and tools for establishing DevOps goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== The Linux challenge ==
Windows and [[Linux]] are very different; not just technologically, but philosophically. Tools are a major component to establishing DevOps, and the lack of Windows-centric tools limited early Windows DevOps adoptions as most initial supporting technologies emerged from Linux and [[open-source]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|website= Microsoft TechNet
|date=24 May 2016 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; WinOps boils down to addressing the same challenges as DevOps, using different tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
