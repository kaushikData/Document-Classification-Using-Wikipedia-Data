      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9230">'''Alternative natural materials''' are [[natural materials]] like [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[adobe]] that are not as commonly in use as materials such as [[wood]] or [[iron]].  Alternative natural materials have many practical uses in areas such as [[sustainable architecture]] and [[engineering]]. The main purpose of using such materials is to minimize the negative effects that our built environment can have on the planet while increasing the efficiency and adaptability of the structures.

== History ==

Alternative natural materials have existed for quite some time but often in very basic forms or only as ingredients to a particular material in the past. For example, earth used as a building material for walls of houses has existed for thousands of years. Much more recently, in the 1920s, the United States government promoted [[rammed earth]] as a fireproof construction method for building farmhouses.&lt;ref name=countrysidemag&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Charmaine R.|title=Building for free with "alternative" natural materials|url=http://www.countrysidemag.com/issues/85/85-3/Charmaine_R_Taylor.html|accessdate=2009-04-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090418032445/http://countrysidemag.com/issues/85/85-3/Charmaine_R_Taylor.html| archivedate= 18 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another more common example is adobe. Adobe homes are prominent in the southwestern U.S. and several Spanish-speaking countries.&lt;ref name= About&gt;{{cite web|last=Craven|first=Jackie|title=Building With Natural Materials|url=http://architecture.about.com/od/naturalmaterials/Build_With_Natural_Materials.htm|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Straw bale]] construction is a more modern concept, but there even exists evidence that straw was used to make homes in African prairies as far back as the [[Paleolithic]] times.&lt;ref name= About/&gt;
Alternative natural materials, specifically their applications, have only recently made their way into more common use. The ideas of being both green and [[sustainable]] in response to [[global warming]] and [[climate change]] shifted more of a focus onto the materials and methods used to build our [[cityscape]] and homes. As environmentally conscious decisions became commonplace, the use of alternative natural materials instead of typical natural materials or man-made materials that rely heavily on natural resources became prominent.

== Materials ==

=== Rock ===
Rock is a great alternative to conventional materials which contain chemicals that may be harmful to people, pets or the environment. Rocks have two great characteristics: good [[thermal mass]] and [[thermal insulation]]. These characteristics make stone a great idea because the temperature in the house stays rather constant thus requiring less air conditioning and other cooling systems. Types of rocks that can be employed are reject stone (pieces of stone that are not able to be used for another task), [[limestone]], and [[flagstone]].
[[File:Sb-wall-tight-curve.jpg|left|thumb|This article shows a straw bale wall under construction.]]

=== Straw ===
[[Straw-bale construction|Straw bales]] can be used as a basis for walls instead of [[drywall]]. Straw provides excellent insulation and fire resistance in a traditional post-and-beam structure, where a wood frame supports the house.&lt;ref name=howstuffworks&gt;{{cite web|last=Edmonds|first=Molly|title=Top 10 Natural Building Materials|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/energy-efficiency/10-natural-building-materials.htm|accessdate=2009-04-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402094611/http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/energy-efficiency/10-natural-building-materials.htm|archivedate=2009-04-02|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These straw walls are about 75% more energy efficient than standard drywalls and because no oxygen can get through the walls, fire cannot spread and there is no chance of [[combustion]].
[[File:Construction maison bambou.jpg|right|thumb|This picture depicts a cyclone- and earthquake-resistant home made completely of bamboo.]]

=== Bamboo ===
In Asian countries, [[bamboo]] is being used for structures like bridges and homes. Bamboo is surprisingly strong and rather flexible and grows incredibly fast, making it a rather abundant material. Although it can be difficult to join corners together, bamboo is immensely strong and makes up for the hardships that can be encountered while building it.

=== Cordwood ===
[[Cordwood]] is a combination of small remnants of [[firewood]] and other [[lumber]] that usually go to waste. These small blocks of wood can easily be put together to make a structure that, like stone, has great insulation as well as thermal mass. Cordwood provides the rustic look of log cabins without the use of tons of lumber. You can build an entire building with just cordwood or use stones to fill in the walls.

=== Rammed earth ===
[[Rammed earth]] is a very abundant material that can be used in place of [[concrete]] and [[brick]]. [[Soil]] is packed tightly into wall molds where it is rammed together and hardened to form a durable wall packing made of nothing more than dirt, stones, and sticks.&lt;ref name=howstuffworks/&gt; Rammed Earth also provides great thermal mass, which means great energy savings. In addition, it is very weatherproof and durable enough that it was used in the Great Wall of China.

=== Earth-sheltered ===
[[Earth sheltering]] is a unique building technique in which buildings are completely constructed on at least one side by some form of Earth whether it be a grass roof, clay walls, or both. This unique system usually includes plenty of windows because of the difficulty involved with using too much electricity in such a house. This adds to the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the house by reducing lighting costs.

=== Papercrete ===
[[Papercrete]] is an interesting and very new material that is a good substitute for concrete. Papercrete is shredded paper, sand, and cement mixed together that forms a very durable brick-like material. Buildings utilizing papercrete are very well-insulated as well as being termite- and fire-resistant. Papercrete is very cheap as it usually only costs about $0.35 per square foot.

=== Adobe ===
[[Adobe]] is an age-old technique that is cheap, easy to obtain, and ideal for hot environments. A mixture of [[sand]], [[clay]], and water is poured into a mold and left in the sun to dry. When dried, it is exceptionally strong and heat-resistant. Adobe doesn’t let much heat through to the inside of the structure, thus providing excellent insulation during the summer to reduce energy costs. Although this clay mixture provides excellent insulation from heat, it is not very waterproof and can be dangerous in earth-quake prone areas due to its tendency to crack easily.

=== Sawdust ===
[[Sawdust]] is a good material to combine with clay or cement mixtures and use for walls. These walls turn out surprisingly sturdy and effectively recycle any trees that may need to be excavated from the building area. Depending what type of sawdust used ([[hardwood]] is best) the wood chips in the walls absorb moisture and help prevent cracking during freeze/thaw cycles.&lt;ref name=countrysidemag/&gt; Sawdust may be combined with water and frozen to produce a material commonly known as [[pykrete]], which is strong, and less prone to melting than regular ice.

[[File:Bio-HQ.jpg|left|thumb|The Dubiotech headquarters, soon to be completed in the United Arab Emirates.]]

== Examples ==

Although this is a newer technology there are some buildings that have already employed these materials, as well as other tactics, to make themselves green.
*One such building design is the proposed Dubiotech headquarters in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. This designs call for solar panels and windows, which would let plenty of natural light in while also getting maximum use out of the sunlight. This building (under delayed construction since the 2008 financial crisis would also be built with an alternative kind of steel that is not made by a process that releases tons of harsh chemicals into the atmosphere.
*Another example is the School of Art, Media, and Design located in Singapore. This school has a roof made completely of grass (an example of Earth-sheltering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kriscenski|first=Ali|title=Amazing Green Roof Art School in Singapore|url=http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/01/23/amazing-green-roof-art-school-in-singapore|accessdate=2009-04-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090331200621/http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/01/23/amazing-green-roof-art-school-in-singapore| archivedate= 31 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the use of less concrete and other materials for the roof, and the building also includes lots of window to utilize natural lighting.

[[File:Mutual Annihilation of a Positron Electron pair.svg|200px|thumb|right|A [[Feynman diagram]] showing the mutual annihilation of a bound state [[electron]] [[positron]] pair into two photons. This bound state is more commonly known as [[positronium]].]]

In [[particle physics]], '''annihilation''' is the process that occurs when a [[subatomic particle]] collides with its respective [[antiparticle]] to produce other particles, such as an [[electron]] colliding with a [[positron]] to produce two [[photon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of the initial pair are conserved in the process and distributed among a set of other particles in the final state. Antiparticles have exactly opposite additive [[quantum number]]s from particles, so the sums of all quantum numbers of such an original pair are zero. Hence, any set of particles may be produced whose total quantum numbers are also zero as long as [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum]] are obeyed.&lt;ref name=Particleadventure.org&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a low-energy annihilation, [[photon]] production is favored, since these particles have no mass. However, high-energy [[particle collider]]s produce annihilations where a wide variety of exotic heavy particles are created.

The word annihilation takes use informally for the interaction of two particles that are not mutual antiparticles - not [[Charge (physics)#Charge conjugation|charge conjugate]].  Some quantum numbers may then not sum to zero in the initial state, but conserve with the same totals in the final state. An example is the "annihilation" of a high-energy [[electron neutrino#Electron antineutrino|electron antineutrino]] with an [[electron]] to produce a {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|W boson-}}.

If the annihilating particles are [[List of particles#Composite particles|composite]], such as [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s, then several different particles are typically produced in the final state.

==Production of a single boson==
If the initial two particles are [[Elementary particle|elementary]] (not composite), then they may combine to produce only a single elementary [[boson]], such as a  [[photon]] ({{Subatomic particle|link=no|Photon}}),  [[gluon]] ({{Subatomic particle|link=no|Gluon}}), {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Z boson}}, or a [[Higgs boson]] ({{Subatomic particle|link=no|Higgs Boson}}). If the total energy in the [[center-of-momentum frame]] is equal to the [[rest mass]] of a real [[boson]] (which is impossible for a massless boson such as the {{Subatomic particle|link=no|Photon}}), then that created particle will continue to exist until it decays according to its [[Exponential decay#Mean lifetime|lifetime]]. Otherwise, the process is understood as the initial creation of a boson that is [[virtual particle|virtual]], which immediately converts into a real particle+antiparticle pair. This is called an [[Mandelstam_variables#Feynman_diagrams|s-channel]] process. An example is the annihilation of an electron with a positron to produce a virtual photon, which converts into a [[muon]] and anti-muon.  If the energy is large enough, a {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Z boson}} could replace the photon. 

==Examples==
===Electron–positron annihilation===
{{main|Electron–positron annihilation}}

: {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Positron|link=yes}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Gamma|link=yes}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Gamma|link=yes}}

When a low-energy [[electron]] annihilates a low-energy [[positron]] (antielectron), they can only produce two [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s, since the electron and positron do not carry enough [[mass-energy]] to produce heavier particles, and the creation of only one photon is forbidden by momentum conservation—a single photon would carry nonzero momentum in any [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]], including the [[center-of-momentum frame]] where the total momentum vanishes. Both the annihilating electron and positron particles have a [[rest energy]] of about 0.511 million electron volts (MeV). If their kinetic energies are relatively negligible, this total rest energy appears as the [[photon energy]] of the gamma rays produced. Each of the gamma rays then has an energy of about 0.511 MeV. Momentum and energy are both conserved, with 1.022 MeV of gamma rays (accounting for the rest energy of the particles) moving in opposite directions (accounting for the total zero momentum of the system).&lt;ref name=Fermilab&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If one or both charged particles carry a larger amount of kinetic energy, various other particles can be produced. Furthermore, the annihilation (or decay) of an electron-positron pair into a ''single'' photon can occur in the presence of a third charged particle to which the excess momentum can be transferred by a virtual photon from the electron or positron. The inverse process, [[pair production]] by a single real photon, is also possible in the electromagnetic field of a third particle.

===Proton-antiproton annihilation===
When a [[proton]] encounters its [[Antiproton|antiparticle]] (and more generally, if any species of [[baryon]] encounters the corresponding [[antibaryon]]), the reaction is not as simple as electron-positron annihilation. Unlike an electron, a proton is a [[List of particles#Composite particles|composite particle]] consisting of three [[Quark model|"valence quarks"]] and an indeterminate number of [[Quark#Sea quarks|"sea quarks"]] bound by [[gluon]]s. Thus, when a proton encounters an antiproton, one of its quarks, usually a constituent valence quark, may annihilate with an [[antiquark]] (which more rarely could be a sea quark) to produce a gluon, after which the gluon together with the remaining quarks, antiquarks, and gluons will undergo a complex process of rearrangement (called [[Hadronization|hadronization or fragmentation]]) into a number of [[meson]]s, (mostly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s), which will share the total energy and momentum. The newly created mesons are unstable, and unless they encounter and interact with some other material, they will decay in a series of reactions that ultimately produce only [[gamma ray]]s, [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[neutrino]]s. This type of reaction will occur between any [[baryon]] (particle consisting of three quarks) and any [[antibaryon]] consisting of three antiquarks, one of which corresponds to a quark in the baryon. (This reaction is unlikely if at least one among the baryon and anti-baryon is exotic enough that they share no constituent quark flavors.)  Antiprotons can and do annihilate with [[neutron]]s, and likewise [[antineutron]]s can annihilate with protons, as discussed below.

Reactions in which proton-antiproton annihilation produces as many as nine mesons have been observed, while production of thirteen mesons is theoretically possible. The generated mesons leave the site of the annihilation at moderate fractions of the speed of light, and decay with whatever lifetime is appropriate for their type of meson.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar reactions will occur when an antinucleon annihilates within a more complex [[atomic nucleus]], save that the resulting mesons, being [[Strong interaction|strongly interacting]], have a significant probability of being absorbed by one of the remaining "spectator" nucleons rather than escaping. Since the absorbed energy can be as much as ~2 [[GeV]], it can in principle exceed the [[binding energy]] of even the heaviest nuclei. Thus, when an antiproton annihilates inside a heavy nucleus such as [[uranium]] or [[plutonium]], partial or complete disruption of the nucleus can occur, releasing large numbers of fast neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;

===Higgs production===
In collisions of two [[nucleon]]s at very high energies, [[Quark#Sea_quarks|sea quarks]] and gluons tend to dominate the interaction rate, so neither nucleon need be an anti-particle for annihilation of a quark pair or "fusion" of two gluons to occur.  [[Higgs_boson#Production|Examples]] of such processes contribute to the production of the long-sought [[Higgs boson]]. The Higgs is directly produced very weakly by annihilation of light (valence) quarks, but heavy {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|top quark}} or {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|bottom quark}} sea  or produced quarks are available. In 2012, the [[CERN]] laboratory in Geneva announced the discovery of the Higgs in the debris from proton-proton collisions at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC).  The strongest Higgs yield is from fusion of two gluons (via annihilation of a heavy quark pair), while two (anti)quarks produce more easily identified events through radiation of a Higgs by a produced virtual [[vector boson]] or annihilation of two such vector bosons.

In [[ecology]], '''bionomics''' (Greek: bio = life; nomos = law) is the comprehensive study of an organism and its relation to its environment. As translated from the French word ''Bionomie'', its first use in English was in the period of 1885-1890. Another way of expressing this word is the term currently referred to as "[[ecology]]".  An example of studies of this type is Richard B. Selander's Bionomics, Systematics and Phylogeny of Lytta, a Genus of Blister Beetles (Coleoptera, Meloidae), Illinois Biological Monographs: number 28, 1960.

According to some scholars, who still adhere to bionomics, it transforms many principles of traditional ecology, recognizing that Life on Earth is hierarchically organized in complex systems, acting as living entities well farther populations and communities.

When related to the territory Ignegnoli talks about Landscape Bionomics, defining Landscape as the "level of biological organization integrating complex systems of plants, animals and humans in a living Entity recognizable in a territory as characterized by suitable emerging properties in a determined spatial configuration". (Ingegnoli, 2011, 2015; Ingegnoli, Bocchi, Giglio, 2017)

The '''bullhead sharks''' are a small [[order (biology)|order]] ('''Heterodontiformes''') of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] modern [[shark]]s ([[Neoselachii]]). The nine living species are placed in a single genus, '''''Heterodontus''''', in the family '''Heterodontidae'''. All are relatively small, with the largest species reaching just {{convert|1.65|m|ft|round=0.5}} in maximum length. They are bottom feeders in tropical and subtropical waters.

The Heterodontiforms appear in the fossil record in the Early [[Jurassic]], well before any of the other [[Galeomorphii]], a group that includes all modern sharks except the [[Squalidae|dogfish]] and its relatives. However, they have never been common, and their origin probably lies even further back.

==Description==
{{Technical|section|date=January 2009}}
[[File:Oeufs002b,55.png|thumb|70px|Bullhead shark [[Egg case (Chondrichthyes)|egg case]]]]

The bullhead sharks are morphologically rather distinctive. The mouth is located entirely [[anterior]] to the orbits. Labial cartilages are found in the most anterior part of the mouth. Nasoral grooves are present, connecting the external nares to the mouth. The nasal capsules are trumpet-shaped and well-separated from orbits. Circumnarial [[skin fold]]s are present, but the rostral process of the [[neurocranium]] (braincase) is absent, although a [[precerebral fossa]] is present. Finally, the braincase bears a [[supraorbital crest]].

The eyes lack a [[nictitating membrane]]. A [[spiracle]] is present, but small. The [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] ends of the fourth and fifth branchial arches are attached, but not fused into a "pickaxe" as in [[Lamniformes|lamniform sharks]]. Heterodontiforms have two [[dorsal fin]]s, with fin spines, as well as an [[anal fin]]. The dorsal and anal fins also contain basal [[cartilage]]s, not just fin rays.

Bullhead Sharks have distinctive small spikes on the front of their dorsal fins. These are rumoured to be poisonous, but no further scientific tests have been done to prove this rumor true or false.

==Species==
Nine living species of bullhead shark are described, with another potential undescribed species in Baja California:
* ''[[Horn shark|Heterodontus francisci]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Charles Frédéric Girard|Girard]], 1855)&lt;/small&gt; (horn shark)
* ''[[Crested bullhead shark|Heterodontus galeatus]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Albert Günther|Günther]], 1870)&lt;/small&gt; (crested bullhead shark)
* ''[[Japanese bullhead shark|Heterodontus japonicus]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay|Maclay]] &amp; [[William John Macleay|W. J. Macleay]], 1884)&lt;/small&gt; (Japanese bullhead shark)
* ''[[Mexican hornshark|Heterodontus mexicanus]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Leighton R. Taylor Jr.|L. R. Taylor]] &amp; [[José Luis Castro-Aguirre|Castro-Aguirre]], 1972)&lt;/small&gt; (Mexican hornshark)
* ''[[Oman bullhead shark|Heterodontus omanensis]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Zachary Hayward Baldwin|Z. H. Baldwin]], 2005)&lt;/small&gt; (Oman bullhead shark)
* ''[[Port Jackson shark|Heterodontus portusjacksoni]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Friedrich Albrecht Anton Meyer|F. A. A. Meyer]], 1793)&lt;/small&gt; (Port Jackson shark)
* ''[[Galapagos bullhead shark|Heterodontus quoyi]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Christophe Paulin de la Poix de Fréminville|Fréminville]], 1840)&lt;/small&gt; (Galapagos bullhead shark)
* ''[[Whitespotted bullhead shark|Heterodontus ramalheira]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[James Smith (ichthyologist)|J. L. B. Smith]], 1949)&lt;/small&gt; (whitespotted bullhead shark)
* ''[[Zebra bullhead shark|Heterodontus zebra]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[John Edward Gray|J. E. Gray]], 1831)&lt;/small&gt; (zebra bullhead shark)
* ''Heterodontus'' sp. X &lt;small&gt;[[Jose Ignacio Castro|J. I. Castro]]&lt;/small&gt; (cryptic hornshark)

The '''Center for Earthquake Studies''' ('''CES'''), is an academic earth science, [[Earthquake engineering|earthquake studies]] and mathematical national research institute, located in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Center for Earthquake Studies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Center for Earthquake Studies|title=Center for Earthquake Studies|url=http://www.ncp.edu.pk/ces.php|work=Center for Earthquake Studies|publisher=Center for Earthquake Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The institute is headquartered in the campus area of the [[National Centre for Physics]] (NCP) and conducts mathematical research in [[earth science]]s, with the close coordination with the NCP.&lt;ref name="Center for Earthquake Studies"/&gt;

==History==
The institute was founded by the [[Government of Pakistan]] after taking the scientific advice from the science adviser dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]].&lt;ref name="Islamic Academy of Sciences"&gt;{{cite web|last=IAS|title=Dr. Professor Ishfaq Ahmad|url=http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof81.htm|work=Islamic Academy of Sciences|publisher=Islamic Academy of Sciences|accessdate=13 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214010934/http://www.ias-worldwide.org/profiles/prof81.htm|archivedate=14 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established in response to the deadliest and devastating [[2005 Pakistan earthquake|earthquake]] in Pakistan, on October 8, 2005.&lt;ref name="Daily Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff report|title=Timely prediction can reduce quake devastation|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\10\09\story_9-10-2009_pg11_2|accessdate=13 January 2013|newspaper=Daily Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially established as the Earthquake Studies Department at the National Center for Physics, it gained its independence shortly after its establishment. The CES undertakes research scientific studies in the development of expertise in anomalous [[Geophysics|geophysical phenomenon]] prior to the [[Seismic activity|seismic activities]]. The CES primarily produces its research outcomes by using the [[computer simulation]] and [[mathematical model]]ling to interpret the seismic activities and the [[earthquake prediction]]s.&lt;ref name="Center for Earthquake Studies"/&gt;

The CES's campus also includes the various ATROPATENA stations network, and supports its research and development with the close collaboration with the Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes"&gt;{{cite web|last=GNFE|title=International Station for the Forecasting of Earthquakes ATROPATENA-PK, Pakistan, Islamabad|url=http://seismonet.org/page.html?id_node=157|work=Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes|publisher=Global Network for the Forecasting of Earthquakes|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first and founding director was dr. [[Ahsan Mubarak]] who is still designated as the CES's senior scientist.&lt;ref name="Daily Pakistan"/&gt; As of current, dr. Muhammad Qaisar is the CES's current administrator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5649">[[Image:Hope-coventina02.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Inscribed bas-relief of Coventina]]'''Coventina''' was a [[Romano-British]] goddess of wells and springs. She is known from multiple inscriptions at one site in [[Northumberland]] county of  [[England]], an area surrounding a wellspring near [[Carrawburgh]] on [[Hadrian's Wall]]. It is possible that other inscriptions, two from [[Hispania]] and one from [[Narbonensis]], refer to Coventina, but this is disputed.&lt;ref name="Coventina"&gt;L. Allason-Jones and B. McKay, ''Coventina's Well'', Oxbow Books/The Trustees of the Clayton Collection, Chester Museum. Oxford, UK, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Well==
[[File:Standing stone at Coventina's Well - geograph.org.uk - 1132064.jpg|thumb|left|Standing stone marking the site of Coventina's Well]]
Dedications to Coventina and [[votive]] deposits were found in a walled area which had been built to contain the outflow from a spring now called "Coventina's Well".  The well and the walled area surrounding it are nearby the site variously referred to as ''Procolita'', ''Brocolitia'', or ''Brocolita'', once a Roman fort and settlement on [[Hadrian's Wall]], now known as [[Carrawburgh]] (The name "Procolita" is found in the 5th century document [[Notitia Dignitatum]], and "Brocolita" in the 7th century [[Ravenna Cosmography]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-britain.org/ravenna-cosmography.htm |title=The British section of the Ravenna Cosmology |publisher=RomanBritain.org |year=2011 |accessdate=2014-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521043759/http://www.roman-britain.org/ravenna-cosmography.htm |archivedate=2014-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of a Roman [[Mithraeum]] and [[Nymphaeum]] are also found near the site.

The well itself was a spring in a rectangular basin 2.6m x 2.4m in the centre of a walled enclosure 11.6m x 12.2m within a wall 0.9m thick.&lt;ref name="PastScape" /&gt; The contents of the well included 13487 coins from [[Mark Antony|Mark Anthony]] to [[Gratian]], a relief of three water [[nymphs]], the head of a male statue, two dedication slabs to the goddess Coventina, ten altars to Coventina and [[Minerva]], two clay incense burners, and a wide range of votive objects.&lt;ref name="PastScape" /&gt;

The site near Coventina's Well was excavated by British [[archaeologist]], [[John Clayton (town clerk)|John Clayton]], in 1876.&lt;ref name="PastScape"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1013364&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=coventina&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |title=PastScape entry for Coventina's Well |publisher=English Heritage |year=2007 |accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many of the artifacts recovered by John Clayton are preserved in the "Clayton Collection" currently currated by English Heritage at Chesters Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The date of the wall at Coventina's Well is uncertain, but some have theorized that it was built sometime after the completion of the Roman fort (dated between the years 128 and 133){{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to define date range|date=April 2014}}. Since Hadrian's Wall does not deviate to avoid the well, this may suggest that the boundary wall around the well was built some time after in order to control the flow of water in a marshy area.&lt;ref name="Coventina" /&gt;

Evidence from coin hoards and stones which covered them and those also blocking the well suggest a fairly abrupt end around 388, perhaps due to events linked to anti-Pagan edicts of [[Theodosius I]].

==Statues==
[[Image:Hope-coventina01.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Bas-relief of triple Coventina]] 
Excavation of the site revealed several inscribed [[altars]], some with depictions of Coventina in typical Roman nymph form - reclining, partially clothed and associated with water. On one, Coventina is either depicted in [[Triple deity|triple form]] or with two attendants.

==Inscriptions==
At least ten inscriptions to Coventina are recorded from Carrawburgh. Several stone altars contained dedications to Coventina, as did two pottery incense burners.

An example of an inscription&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood, R. G. and Wright, R. P. 1965. ''The Roman Inscriptions of Britain (RIB)''. Oxford, Clarendon Press. [http://www.roman-britain.org/epigraphy/rib_index.htm Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; from the site reads:

:''Deae Cov{v}entinae'' /
:''T D Cosconia'' /
:''nvs Pr Coh'' /
:''I Bat L M''

“To the Goddess Coventina, Titus D[unclear] Cosconianus, Prefectus of the First Cohort of [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavians]], freely and deservedly (dedicated this stone).”

Three altars dedicated to [[Mithraism|Mithras]] were placed there by the Prefects of the military garrison{{Citation needed|reason=Reference required for this statement|date=April 2014}}.

*In his book ''[[The Skystone]],'' [[Jack Whyte]] represents Coventina as the inspiration for [[The Lady of the Lake]].

'''Cowan Lake State Park''' is a {{convert|1775|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Ohio state parks|Ohio state park]] in [[Clinton County, Ohio|Clinton County]], [[Ohio]], in the United States. It is operated by the [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources]]. Cowan Lake State Park is open for year-round recreation and is known for a variety of birds that attract birdwatching enthuiasts to the park in southwestern Ohio.&lt;ref name=odnr/&gt;

==History==
What is now Cowan Lake State Park was once home to the [[Miami (tribe)|Miami]] and [[Shawnee]] Indians. The [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794 resulted in the opening of the land to American settlement. The first settler in the area was [[William Smalley]]. Smalley had previously been held captive by the [[Lenape]]. His language skills and knowledge of the land left him ideally suited to be among the pioneers in settling what became [[Clinton County, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

[[Cowan Creek (Ohio)|Cowan Creek]], named for pioneer surveyor John Cowan, was dammed in 1950. The creation of [[Cowan Lake (Ohio)|Cowan Lake]] led to the establishment of Cowan Lake State Park in 1968.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt; Its surface area is {{convert|692|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name=lakes/&gt;

==Geology and ecology==
Cowan Lake State Park lies atop [[limestone]] that is laden with [[fossil]]s. The fossilized plants and animals attract attention from both professional and amateur [[Paleontology|paleontologist]]s. Much of what is now Ohio was covered by massive inland seas and lakes such as [[Lake Maumee]]. As the [[Appalachian Mountains]] were formed, the limestone that was once the sea floor was pushed to the surface.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

Cowan Lake is surrounded by a [[deciduous forest]] of [[beech]] and [[maple]] trees. The combination of lake and forest makes the park a destination for birders, who can observe [[mallards]], [[American wigeon]]s, [[merganser]]s, [[Great blue heron|great blue]] and [[green-backed heron]]s, [[killdeer]], [[eastern bluebird]]s, [[catbird]]s, and many other species of birds.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt; The most common [[mammal]]s at the park are [[groundhog]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and [[opossum]]s.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

Other plant life found at the park include [[bloodroot]], [[wild ginger]], and [[American lotus]]. The lotus is a water lily that thrives in the shallow waters of Cowan Lake. The leaves of the plant are quite large with yellow flowers.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

==Recreation==
Cowan Lake State Park is open for year-round recreation. There are six picnic areas and two pavilions. Cowan Lake State Park features six [[hiking]] trails and one trail that is open to [[mountain bike]]s.&lt;ref name=odnr-activities/&gt;

There are 27 [[cottage]]s that are heated and have [[air-conditioning]]. The cottages are fully furnished and linens are provided. There are 237 electric camp-sites and 17 sites without electricity. A centrally located bathhouse has showers, flush toilets and a sanitary dump station for RVs.&lt;ref name=odnr-activities/&gt;

Cowan Lake is open for boating, swimming and fishing. Motorboats have a 10 [[horsepower]] limit. A [[marina]] on the southern shore of the lake provides rental boats, canoes and motors, with four launch ramps, fuel and dock rentals. Common game fish in Cowan Lake are [[muskellunge]], [[crappie]], [[largemouth bass]] and [[bluegill]]. There is a handicapped accessible fishing pier at the Pine Tree picnic area. A public swimming beach is on the southern shore of the lake. The 1,000 foot beach is located near the campers bathhouse and also has a snack bar.&lt;ref name=odnr-activities/&gt;

Dendrons are regularly branched, tree-like fragments and for larger ones the polymer backbone is wrapped to give sausage-like, cylindrical molecular objects. Figure 1 shows a cartoon representation with the backbone in red and the dendrons like cake slices in green. It also provides a concrete chemical structure showing a [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) backbone, the methyl group of which is replaced by a dendron of the third generation (three consecutive branching points).

Figure 1. Cartoon representation (left) and a concrete example of a third generation dendronized polymer (right). The peripheral [[amine]] groups are modified by a substituent X which often is a [[protection group]]. Upon deprotection and modification substantial property changes can be achieved. The subscript n denotes the number of repeat units.

==Structure and applications==

Dendronized polymers can contain several thousands of dendrons in one [[macromolecule]] and have a stretched out, [[anisotropic]] structure. In this regard they differ from the more or less spherically shaped [[dendrimers]], where a few dendrons are attached to a small, dot-like core resulting in an isotropic structure. Depending on dendron generation, the polymers differ in thickness as the atomic force microscopy image shows (Figure 2). Neutral and charged dendronized polymers are highly soluble in organic solvents and in water, respectively. This is due to their low tendency to entangle. Dendronized polymers have been synthesized with, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, [[polystyrene]], [[polyacetylene]], [[polyphenylene]], [[polythiophene]], [[polyfluorene]], [[poly(phenylene vinylene)]], [[poly(phenylene acetylene)]], [[polysiloxane]], [[polyoxanorbornene]], [[poly(ethylene imine)]] (PEI) backbones. [[Molar masses]] up to 200 Mio g/mol have been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;B. Zhang, R. Wepf, K. Fischer, M. Schmidt, S. Besse, P. Lindner, B. T. King, R. Siegel, P. Schurtenberger, Y. Talmon, Y. Ding, M. Kröger, A. Halperin, A. D. Schlüter, ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.'' '''2011''', ''50'', 737.&lt;/ref&gt; Dendronized polymers have been investigated for/as bulk structure control, responsivity to external stimuli, single molecule chemistry, templates for [[nanoparticle]] formation, catalysis, electro-optical devices, and bio-related applications. Particularly attractive is the use of water-soluble dendronized polymers for the immobilization of enzymes on solid surfaces (inside glass tubes or microfluidic devices) and for the preparation of dendronized polymer-enzyme conjugates.&lt;ref&gt;S.

==Synthesis==

The two main approaches into this class of polymers are the [[macromonomer]] route and the attach-to route. In the former, a monomer which already carries the dendron of final size is polymerized. In the latter the dendrons are constructed generation by generation directly on an already existing polymer. Figure 4 illustrates the difference for a simple case. The macromonomer route results in shorter chains for higher generations and the attach-to route is prone to lead to structure imperfections as an enormous number of chemical reactions have to be performed for each macromolecule.

==History==

The name “Dendronized Polymer” which meanwhile is internationally accepted was coined by Schlüter in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Schlüter, ''Top. Curr. Chem.'' '''1998''', ''197'', 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The first report on such a macromolecule which at that time was called “Rod-shaped Dendrimer” goes back to a patent by Tomalia in 1987&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Tomalia, P. M. Kirchoff, US Patent 4,694,064 '''1987'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by Percec’s first mentioning in the open literature of a [[polymer]] with “tapered side chains” in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;V. Percec, J. Heck, M. Lee, G. Ungar, A. Alvarez-Castillo, ''J. Mater. Chem.'' '''1992''', ''2'', 1033.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the potential of these polymers as cylindrical [[nanoobjects]] was recognized.&lt;ref&gt;R. Freudenberger, W. Claussen, A. D. Schlüter, H. Wallmeier, ''Polymer'' '''1994''', ''35'', 4496.&lt;/ref&gt; Many groups worldwide contributed to this field. They can be found in review articles.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Schlüter, J. P. Rabe ''Angew. Chem.

The '''Dinaric Mountains mixed forests''' form a terrestrial [[ecoregion]] of the [[Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests]] [[Biome]] in [[Southeastern Europe]], according to both the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]]. It also is in the [[Palearctic ecozone]].

==Distribution==
The Dinaric Mountains mixed forests compose the montane forest region of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. This mountain range stretches along the eastern coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and occupy 58,200&amp;nbsp;km² (22,500&amp;nbsp;mi²) in [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], northern [[Albania]], and northeastern [[Italy]].

==Description==
The climate of the ecoregion is wet and extremely humid. Precipitation ranges are generally above 1500&amp;nbsp;mm and ranges between 2000 and 3500&amp;nbsp;mm are common. Maximums measured in the hinterland of the [[Bay of Kotor]] surpass annual averages beyond 4500&amp;nbsp;mm ([[Crkvice]]), the highest precipitation ranges in Europe and one of the highest of the Northern Hemisphere. It is part of [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]'s [[Temperate climate|temperate]] type with humid summers (Cfs) and mountain snow climates (Dfs). Due to snow abundance and avalanching, alpine biotopes are common for all high mountains. Several small glaciers still persist in the [[Durmitor]] and [[Prokletije]] ranges, the Dinaric Alps' highest [[massif]]s.

With high precipitation ranges and an overabundance of limestones, [[karst]] relief is dominating.

Due to the wide altitudinal range of this ecoregion the highest elevations (above 1,500 m) are covered with conifer forests, with a mixed broadleaf vegetation and occurring lower. 

The conifer zone is dominated by the [[Norway spruce]], [[Abies alba|silver fir]], and [[European black pine]] with the admixture of the [[European beech]]. The dominant species of the lower zones include various deciduous oaks (''[[Quercus frainetto]]'', ''[[Quercus pubescens|Q. pubescens]]'', ''[[Quercus cerris|Q. cerris]]'') and the [[Carpinus orientalis|oriental hornbeam (''Carpinus orientalis'')]]. The [[Fraxinus ornus|South European flowering ash (''Fraxinus ornus'')]] marks the submediterranean zone at region below 600–1000 m (from N to S). 

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the ecoregion is shared between the Adriatic and East Mediterranean provinces of the [[Mediterranean Region]], within the [[Holarctic Kingdom]] (according to [[Armen Takhtajan]]'s delineation).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">'''Distance decay''' is a [[Human geography|geographical]] term which describes the effect of [[distance]] on cultural or spatial [[interaction]]s.  The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.

With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-[[abandoned railway]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in [[communications technology]], such as telegraphs, telephones, [[broadcasting]], and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692313000653 | doi=10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.04.001 | volume=31 | title=Boots are made for walking: interactions across physical and social space in infrastructure-poor regions | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Transport Geography | pages=226–235 | author=Matous Petr, Todo Yasuyuki, Mojo Dagne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance decay is graphically represented by a curving line that swoops [[convex function|concavely]] downward as distance along the x-axis increases.  Distance decay can be mathematically represented as an [[Inverse-square law]] by the expression

&lt;math&gt;I = const. \times d^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; 
or
&lt;math&gt;I \propto 1/d^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where I is interaction and d is distance. It can take other forms such as [[Exponential decay|negative exponential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nekola J. C., White P. S. | year = 1999 | title = The distance decay of similarity in biogeography and ecology | url = http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/ecoinfo/distance_decay/nekolapeter.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 867–878 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00305.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.

&lt;math&gt;I \propto e^{-d}&lt;/math&gt;
.

Distance decay is evident in town/[[city centre]]s. It can refer to various things which decline with greater distance from the center of the [[Central Business District]] (CBD):
* density of [[pedestrian]] traffic
* street quality 
* quality of shops (depending on definitions of 'quality' and 'center')
* height of buildings 
* [[bid rent theory|price of land]]

Distance decay weighs into the decision to migrate, leading many [[Human migration|migrants]] to move less far.

== Related concepts ==

Related terms include "[[friction of distance]]", which describes the force that creates distance decay and [[Waldo R. Tobler]]'s "[[Tobler's first law of geography|First law of geography]]", an informal statement that "All things are related, but near things are more related than far things." 
"[[Loss of Strength Gradient]]" holds that the amount of a nation's military power that could be brought to bear in any part of the world depends on geographic distance.

The '''Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory''' is an [[Earth's Atmosphere|atmospheric]] baseline station operated by [[Environment and Climate Change Canada]] located at [[Alert, Nunavut]], on the north-eastern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]], about 800&amp;nbsp;km south of the [[geographic north pole]].

The observatory is the northernmost of 31 Global Stations in an international network coordinated by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) under its [[Global Atmosphere Watch]] (GAW) program to study the long-term effects of pollution on the atmospheric environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAW Global Stations|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/GAW_Global_st.html|website=WMO Extranet|publisher=World Meteorological Organization (WMO)|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among these 31 stations, Alert is one of three greenhouse gas "intercomparison supersites",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment and Climate Change Canada - Climate Change - Greenhouse Gases and Aerosols|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/sc-cs/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=E573D6F9-1|website=www.ec.gc.ca|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Mauna Loa]] in [[Hawaii]] and [[Cape Grim]] in [[Australia]], which, due to their locations far from industrial activity, provide the international scientific community with a baseline record of atmospheric chemistry.

== Geography ==

The observatory is located on a plateau about 6&amp;nbsp;km south of [[CFS Alert|Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert]], which is itself located on the shore of the [[Lincoln Sea]], 15 kilometres from the mouth of the [[Nares Strait]]. The region is characterized by recent glacial activity, with still extant glaciers visible among the peaks of the [[United States Range]] approximately 40 kilometres to the west. The landscape immediately surrounding the observatory is undulating, marked by cliffs and crevasses and a number of small rivers which can become impassable during [[freshet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment and Climate Change Canada - Climate Change - Alert Nunavut|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/mges-ghgm/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=3150486A-1|website=www.ec.gc.ca|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south, the Winchester Hills are the dominant visible feature. A number of small freshwater lakes provide [[CFS Alert]] (and by extension, the observatory) with drinking water.

Due to its high latitude, the observatory experiences 24-hour daylight from the beginning of April to early September, and the sun remains below the horizon from mid-October to late February. The intermediate periods are marked by a slight diurnal cycle. The dark season is responsible for much of the unique atmospheric chemistry that occurs during polar sunrise. The lack of sunlight to act as a catalyst causes a buildup of pollution from industrial areas down south, and the [[polar vortex]] amplifies this effect by containing pollution within the high Arctic. During sunrise, this pollution is responsible for a phenomenon known as [[Arctic haze]].

== Climate ==

[[File:GAW Lab windrose.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Windrose produced with data from the observatory's anemometers, 1987-2015]]

[[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]]'s climate is exceptionally dry, seeing very little annual precipitation. (It is, in fact, considered a desert.) What rain does fall generally comes in the form of mist or drizzle. Heavy snowfalls are typically confined to the period from September through November, but can occur again after polar sunrise. Fog is common due to proximity to the ocean, particularly in the summer and fall. When temperatures drop below freezing in September and October, the damp air also causes accumulations of hoar frost.

Though conditions in Alert are cold, with only two months of the year seeing average temperatures above the freezing point (snow is possible in any month of the year), they are not as cold as other locations further south, such as [[Eureka, Nunavut|Eureka]], because proximity to the [[Arctic Ocean]] has as a moderating effect. It is more accurate to characterize conditions in Alert as consistently cold, rather than extremely cold.

Prevailing winds at the observatory are from the southwest, which usually bring clear skies and warmer temperatures. North winds off the ocean are typically accompanied by fog and sudden drops in temperature. (North winds are also unwelcome at the observatory, as they bring exhaust from the station's diesel generators.) Conditions are typically calm through the dark winter months, once the [[polar vortex]] has set up for the season. Three out of five days have wind speeds below two metres per second at this time of year. (However, when windy conditions arise in the winter, they tend to be extreme. Storms can last for days at a time.) These conditions continue through polar sunrise, but reverse dramatically with the onset of freshet, which brings high, gusting winds.

The establishment of the Joint Arctic Weather Station (JAWS) on April 9, 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=J. Peter Jr.|title=The Establishment of Alert, N.W.T., Canada|journal=Arctic|date=March 1990|volume=43|issue=1|pages=21–34|doi=10.14430/arctic1587|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/1587|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the beginning of continuous meteorological measurements in [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]].  The weather station frequently provided support for scientific research in Alert, including the collection of weekly flask samples for the measurement of carbon dioxide, the first of which was taken on July 8, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases|url=http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/wdcgg/|website=World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases|publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]]|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing interest in studies of phenomena such as [[Arctic haze]] led to a conference in 1977 in [[Lillestrøm, Norway]] with participation from scientists of seven different countries.  Following this conference, the Arctic Air-Sampling Network (AASN) was created to share data between scientific organizations in each member nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rahn|first1=Kenneth A.|title=The Arctic air-sampling network in 1980|journal=Atmospheric Environment (1967)|date=January 1981|volume=15|issue=8|pages=1349–1352|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(81)90340-1|bibcode=1981AtmEn..15.1349R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To fulfill Canadian obligations to this program, the Canadian Arctic Aerosol Sampling Network (CAASN) was created, eventually consisting of three stations: [[Mould Bay]] (April 1979), [[Igloolik]] (November 1979), and Alert (July 1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrie|first1=L.A.|last2=Hoff|first2=R.M.|last3=Daggupaty|first3=S.M.|title=The influence of mid-latitudinal pollution sources on haze in the Canadian arctic|journal=Atmospheric Environment (1967)|date=January 1981|volume=15|issue=8|pages=1407–1419|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(81)90347-4|bibcode=1981AtmEn..15.1407B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, the program was condensed and refocused.  The sampling programs in [[Igloolik]] and [[Mould Bay]] were discontinued, and the program in Alert became part of the core mandate of the newly reformed Canadian Arctic Aerosol Chemistry Program (CAACP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Arctic Aerosol Chemistry Program (CAACP)|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/natchem/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=573F3546-1|publisher=Environment and Climate Change Canada|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gradually increasing amount of experimental research being done in Alert made the construction of a permanent observatory a viable option.  In 1985, the Canadian Baseline Program was founded, and on August 29 the following year the Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) Observatory was officially opened.  In 1989, the [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]]'s BAPMoN program was merged with the Global Ozone Observing System (GO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OS) to form the Global Atmosphere Watch Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background and History|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/history.html|website=WMO Extranet|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the original observatory building was expanded to roughly three times its size, including the addition of a 10 m tall walk-up tower.

Following the death of Dr. Neil Trivett in 2002 (an Environment Canada researcher who was largely responsible for the construction of the observatory), it was officially renamed in July 2006 as the Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitnell|first1=Tim|title=Scientist honoured for work|url=http://www.thespec.com/news-story/2964713-scientist-honoured-for-work/|accessdate=22 January 2017|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|publisher=Metroland Media Group|date=2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurements and research ==

In addition to the ongoing flask sample programs, the observatory maintains a core group of continuous measurement programs which include monitoring of [[aerosol]]s, [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[ozone]] (both ground level and stratospheric), broadband [[solar irradiance]] and [[albedo]], [[permafrost]] temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Sharon L.|last2=Burgess|first2=Margo M.|last3=Riseborough|first3=Dan|last4=Mark Nixon|first4=F.|title=Recent trends from Canadian permafrost thermal monitoring network sites|journal=Permafrost and Periglacial Processes|date=January 2005|volume=16|issue=1|pages=19–30|doi=10.1002/ppp.511}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs), and ground level meteorological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alert (Canada)|url=https://gawsis.meteoswiss.ch/GAWSIS//index.html#/search/station/stationReportDetails/487|website=GAWSIS Station Information System|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory also supports experimental testing of new monitoring equipment, and short-term, intensive research programs, e.g., NETCARE (Network on Climate and Aerosols: Addressing Key Uncertainties in Remote Canadian Environments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NETCARE Website|url=https://www.netcare-project.ca/|website=www.netcare-project.ca|publisher=NETCARE|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research and data collection at the observatory is collaborative, including long-standing partnerships with, e.g., [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BSRN Stations|url=https://www.pangaea.de/ddi?request=bsrn/BSRNEvent&amp;format=html&amp;title=BSRN+Stations|website=www.pangaea.de|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESRL/GMD Aerosols Group - Alert Station Information|url=https://esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aero/net/alt.html|website=esrl.noaa.gov|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=EN-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Heidelberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institut für Umweltphysik|url=http://www.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/institut/forschung/groups/kk/en/index_html|website=www.iup.uni-heidelberg.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scripps CO2 Program|url=http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/|website=scrippsco2.ucsd.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CSIRO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steele|first1=L.P.|last2=Krummel|first2=P.B.|last3=Langenfelds|first3=R.L.|title=Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Record from Alert, NWT, Canada|url=http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/csiro/csiro-alt.html|website=cdiac.ornl.gov|publisher=CDIAC|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural Resources Canada]], and [[Health Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Network of Northern Research Operators »  » Alert – Atmospheric Radionuclides Monitoring Station|url=http://cnnro.ca/alert-atmospheric-radionuclides-monitoring-station/|website=cnnro.ca|accessdate=23 January 2017|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depletion events ===

While it had been known since 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrie|first1=L. A.|last2=Bottenheim|first2=J. W.|last3=Schnell|first3=R. C.|last4=Crutzen|first4=P. J.|last5=Rasmussen|first5=R.

(The first continuous monitoring instruments for atmospheric mercury were installed at the observatory that year.)  Until that time, it was generally agreed that elemental mercury persisted in the atmosphere for 6–12 months, which allowed it to reach remote locations such as the Arctic, far from emission sources.

In the springtime, elemental mercury undergoes photochemically initiated oxidation reactions and converts to a more reactive and less stable form of mercury in the atmosphere. This was a means by which mercury could be removed from the atmosphere and deposit to the ground that was not previously known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schroeder|first1=W. H.|display-authors=etal|title=Arctic springtime depletion of mercury|journal=Nature|date=23 July 1998|volume=394|issue=6691|pages=331–332|doi=10.1038/28530|bibcode=1998Natur.394..331S}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events were later termed atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs), and the underlying chemistry that connects them with the simultaneous ozone depletions has been and continues to be thoroughly researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steffen|first1=A.|display-authors=etal|title=A synthesis of atmospheric mercury depletion event chemistry in the atmosphere and snow|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|date=12 March 2008|volume=8|issue=6|pages=1445–1482|doi=10.5194/acp-8-1445-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8307">The '''dry matter''' or '''dry weight''' is a measurement of the mass of something when completely dried.

The dry matter of plant and animal material consists of all its constituents excluding water. The dry matter of food includes [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral|minerals]], and [[antioxidant]]s (e.g., [[thiocyanate]], [[anthocyanin]], and [[quercetin]]). Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which provide the energy in foods (measured in kilocalories or kilojoules), make up ninety percent of the dry weight of a diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders_of_nutrition/overview_of_nutrition/carbohydrates_proteins_and_fats.html "Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Fats."] ''The Merck Manual''.&lt;/ref&gt; Water content in foods varies widely. A large number of foods are more than half water by weight, including boiled oatmeal (84.5%), cooked macaroni (78.4%), boiled eggs (73.2%), boiled rice (72.5%), white meat chicken (70.3%) and sirloin steak (61.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=American Physiological Society| title= Physiological Reviews, Volume 2| year= 1922| publisher= [[Harvard University]]| pages= 123–124| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6YkVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=percentage+of+water+in+foods&amp;lr=&amp;cd=11#v=onepage&amp;q=percentage%20of%20water%20in%20foods&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fruits and vegetables are 70 to 95% water.  Most meats are on average about 70% water.  Breads are approximately 36% water.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite book | last= Brown| first= Amy Christine| title= Understanding Food: Principles and Preparation| year= 2007| edition= 3rd| publisher= [[Cengage Learning]]| page= 25| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=edPzm5KSMmYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=water+content+of+foods+fruits+vegetables+breads&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20content%20of%20foods%20fruits%20vegetables%20breads&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-495-10745-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some foods have a water content of less than 5%, e.g., peanut butter,&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt; crackers, and chocolate cake.&lt;ref&gt;Kava, Ruth.  [https://www.acsh.org/healthissues/newsID.609/healthissue_detail.asp Water Log.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621043211/https://www.acsh.org/healthissues/newsID.609/healthissue_detail.asp |date=June 21, 2010 }}  ''ACSH''.  April 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Water content of dairy products is quite variable.  Butter is 15% water.  Cow's milk ranges between 88-86% water.  Swiss cheese is 37% percent water.&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;  The water content of milk and dairy products varies with the percentage of [[butterfat]] so that whole milk has the lowest percentage of water and skimmed milk has the highest.

In the sugar industry the dry matter content is an important parameter to control the crystallization process and is often measured on-line by means of microwave density meters.&lt;ref&gt;Bento, Luis. [http://www.sucropedia.com/?p=entries&amp;a=read&amp;id=E0093 Microwave Sensors.] ''Sucropedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dry matter basis==
The nutrient or mineral content of foods, animal feeds or plant tissues are often expressed on a dry matter basis, i.e. as a proportion of the total dry matter in the material. For example a 138-gram apple contains 84% water (116 g water and 22 g dry matter per apple).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gebhardt|first1=S.E.|last2=Thomas|first2=R.G.|title=Nutritive value of foods|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400525/Data/hg72/hg72_2002.pdf|website=www.ars.usda.gov|publisher=[[USDA]]|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potassium content is 0.72% on a dry matter basis, i.e. 0.72% of the dry matter is potassium. The apple, therefore, contains 158&amp;nbsp;mg potassium (0.72/100 X 22 g). Dried apple contains the same concentration of potassium on a dry matter basis (0.72%), but is only 32% water (68% dry matter). So 138 g of dried apple contains 93.8 g dry matter and 675&amp;nbsp;mg potassium (0.72/100 x 93.8 g).

When formulating a diet or mixed animal feed, nutrient or mineral concentrations are generally given on a dry matter basis; it is therefore important to consider the moisture content of each constituent when calculating total quantities of the different nutrients supplied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reiling|first1=B.A.|title=Feed Dry Matter Conversions|url=http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/pages/publicationD.jsp?publicationId=1398|website=www.ianrpubs.unl.edu|publisher=University of Nebraska–Lincoln Extension|accessdate=14 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032253/http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/pages/publicationD.jsp?publicationId=1398|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Fat in Dry Matter|FDM}}Fat in dry matter (FDM)==
Cheese contains both dry matter and water. The dry matter in cheese contains proteins, butterfat, minerals, and [[lactose]] (milk sugar),{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} although little lactose survives [[fermentation]] when the cheese is made.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;!-- The previously cited source does not support the statement --&gt; A cheese's fat content is expressed as the percentage of fat in the cheese's dry matter (abbreviated FDM or FiDM), which excludes the cheese's water content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Spreer| first1= Edgar| last2= Mixa| first2= Axel| title= Milk and Dairy Product Technology | date= 1998| publisher= [[CRC Press]]| page= 246| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EWlVWwNUgMQC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=%22dry+matter+content+and+not+on+the+absolute+percentage%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dry%20matter%20content%20and%20not%20on%20the%20absolute%20percentage%22&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-8247-0094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a cheese is 50% water (and, therefore, 50% dry matter) and has 25% fat, its fat content would be 50% fat in dry matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Bender| first1= David A.| last2= Bender| first2= Arnold Eric| title= A Dictionary of Food and Nutrition | year= 2005| edition= 2nd| publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]| page= 96| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oR00iNDdZJcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22fat+in+dry+matter%22+cheese+water&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1980&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=28#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fat%20in%20dry%20matter%22%20cheese%20water&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-19-860961-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal feed==
Dry matter can refer to the dry portion of animal feed. A substance in the feed, such as a nutrient or toxin, can be referred to on a dry matter basis (abbreviated DMB) to show its level in the feed (e.g., [[Parts per million|ppm]]). Considering nutrient levels in different feeds on a dry matter basis (rather than an as-is basis) makes a comparison easier because feeds contain different percentages of water. This also allows a comparison between the level of a given nutrient in dry matter and the level needed in an animal’s diet.&lt;ref&gt;Wattiaux, Michel A. [http://babcock.cals.wisc.edu/?q=node/130 Dairy Essentials, Chapter 2: Composition and Analysis of Feed.] ''Babcock Institute''.&lt;/ref&gt; Dry matter intake (DMI) refers to feed intake excluding its water content. The percentage of water is frequently determined by heating the feed on a paper plate in a microwave oven or using the Koster Tester to dry the feed. Ascertaining DMI can be useful for low-energy feeds with a high percentage of water in order to ensure adequate energy intake. Animals eating these kinds of feeds have been shown to consume less dry matter and food energy.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, John K.; Montgomery, Monty J. [http://www.utextension.utk.edu/publications/pbfiles/pb1598.pdf Managing Intake of Lactating Dairy Cows.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615042049/http://www.utextension.utk.edu/publications/pbfiles/pb1598.pdf |date=June 15, 2010 }} ''UT Extension''.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem called dry matter loss can result from heat generation, as caused by microbial respiration. It decreases the content of nonstructural carbohydrate, protein, and food energy.&lt;ref&gt;Buckmaster, Dennis R.

'''Ecological genetics''' is the study of [[genetics]] in natural populations.

This contrasts with [[classical genetics]], which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains, and [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis]], which studies genes at the molecular level.

Research in this field is on [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] of ecological significance—that is, traits related to [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]], which affect an organism's survival and reproduction. Examples might be: flowering time, [[drought]] tolerance, [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], [[mimicry]], avoidance of attacks by [[predator]]s.

Research usually involves a mixture of field and laboratory studies.&lt;ref&gt;Ford E.B. 1981. ''Taking genetics into the countryside''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of [[death|mortality]] in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on [[insect]]s and other organisms that have short generation times.

== History ==
Although work on natural populations had been done previously, it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the [[United Kingdom|English]] biologist [[Edmund Brisco Ford|E.B. Ford]] (1901–1988) in the early 20th century. Ford was taught genetics at [[Oxford University]] by [[Julian Huxley]], and started research on the genetics of natural populations in 1924. Ford also had a long working relationship with [[R.A. Fisher]]. By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of [[genetic polymorphism]],&lt;ref name ="New systematics"&gt;Ford E.B. 1940. Polymorphism and taxonomy. In Huxley J. ''The new systematics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford E.B. 1965. ''Genetic polymorphism''. All Souls Studies, Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher had got accustomed to high [[natural selection]] values in nature. This was one of the main outcomes of research on natural populations. Ford's magnum opus was ''Ecological genetics'', which ran to four editions and was widely influential.&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Ford E.B. 1975. ''Ecological genetics'', 4th ed. Chapman and Hall, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable ecological geneticists would include [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] who worked on [[chromosome]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] in [[Drosophila|fruit flies]]. As a young researcher in Russia, Dobzhansky had been influenced by [[Sergei Chetverikov]], who also deserves to be remembered as a founder of genetics in the field, though his significance was not appreciated until much later. Dobzhansky and colleagues carried out studies on natural populations of ''Drosophila'' species in western USA and Mexico over many years.&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius. ''Genetics and the origin of species''. Columbia, N.Y. 1st ed 1937; second ed 1941; 3rd ed 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius 1970. ''Genetics of the evolutionary process''. Columbia, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius 1981. ''Dobzhansky's genetics of natural populations I-XLIII''. R.C. Lewontin, J.A. Moore, W.B. Provine &amp; B. Wallace, eds. Columbia University Press, New York 1981. (reprints the 43 papers in this series, all but two of which were authored or co-authored by Dobzhansky)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Sheppard]], [[Cyril Clarke]], [[Bernard Kettlewell]] and [[A.J. Cain]] were all strongly influenced by Ford; their careers date from the post World War II era. Collectively, their work on [[lepidoptera]], and on human [[blood groups]], established the field, and threw light on selection in natural populations where its role had been once doubted.

Work of this kind needs long-term funding, as well as grounding in both ecology and genetics. These are both difficult requirements. Research projects can last longer than a researcher's career; for instance, research into [[mimicry]] started 150 years ago, and is still going strongly.&lt;ref&gt;Mallet J. and Joron M. 1999. Evolution in diversity in warning color and mimicry: polymorphisms, shifting balance and speciation. ''Annual Review of Ecological Systematics'' 1999. '''30''' 201–233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruxton G.D. Sherratt T.N. and Speed M.P. 2004. ''Avoiding attack: the evolutionary ecology of crypsis, warning signals &amp; mimicry''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Funding of this type of research is still rather erratic, but at least the value of working with natural populations in the field cannot now be doubted.

The '''Ectasian Period''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἔκτασις ''(éktasis)'', meaning "extension") is the second [[geologic]] [[geologic period|period]] in the [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[Era (geology)|Era]] and lasted from {{Period start|Ectasian}} [[annum|Mya]] ago to {{Period start|Stenian}} Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on [[stratigraphy]], these dates are defined [[Absolute dating|chronometrically]].

Geologically the name refers to the continued expansion of [[platform cover]]s during this period.

This period is interesting for the first evidence of sexual reproduction. The 1.2 billion years old [[Hunting Formation]] on [[Somerset Island (Nunavut)|Somerset Island]], [[Canada]], dates from the end of the Ectasian. It contains the microfossils of the multicellular filaments of ''[[Bangiomorpha pubescens]]'' (type of [[red algae]]), the first taxonomically resolved [[eukaryote]]. This was the first organism that exhibited sexual reproduction, which is an essential feature for complex multicellularity. Complex multicellularity is different from "simple" multicellularity, such as colonies of organisms living together. True multicellular organisms contain cells that are specialized for different functions. This is, in fact, an essential feature of sexual reproduction as well, since the male and female [[gamete]]s are specialized cells. Organisms that reproduce sexually must solve the problem of generating an entire organism from just the germ cells.

Sexual reproduction and the ability of gametes to develop into an organism are the necessary antecedents to true multicellularity. In fact, we tend to think of sexual reproduction and true multicellularity as occurring at the same time, and true multicellularity is often taken as a marker for sexual reproduction.

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Efficient energy use''', sometimes simply called '''energy efficiency''', is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses.

There are many motivations to improve energy efficiency. Reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy-efficient technology. Reducing energy use is also seen as a solution to the problem of reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important solution is to remove government-led energy subsidies that promote high energy consumption and inefficient energy use in more than half of the countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2010) ‘Subsidies for Fossil Fuels and Climate Change: A Comparative Perspective’, International Journal of Environmental Studies, Vol. 67, No. 3, pp. 203-217.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515305&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the ''twin pillars'' of [[sustainable energy]] policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Prindle |first1= Bill |last2= Eldridge |first2= Maggie |last3= Eckhardt |first3= Mike |last4= Frederick |first4= Alyssa |title= The twin pillars of sustainable energy: synergies between energy efficiency and renewable energy technology and policy |date= May 2007 |publisher= American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) |place= Washington, DC, USA |url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.545.4606&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |access-date= 2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are high priorities in the sustainable [[energy hierarchy]]. In many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate of energy at which domestic energy resources are depleted.

==Overview==
{{Further|Domestic energy consumption}}
Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily increasing [[energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=UNP|location=London|pages=180–181|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; States such as Connecticut and New York have created quasi-public [[Green bank (financial institution)|Green Banks]] to help residential and commercial building-owners finance energy efficiency upgrades that reduce emissions and cut consumers' energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, Hallie. "Working Paper: State Green Banks for Clean Energy" http://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WorkingPaper_StateGreenBanks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovin's [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] points out that in industrial settings, "there are abundant opportunities to save 70% to 90% of the energy and cost for lighting, fan, and pump systems; 50% for electric motors; and 60% in areas such as heating, cooling, office equipment, and appliances." In general, up to 75% of the electricity used in the US today could be saved with efficiency measures that cost less than the electricity itself, the same holds true for home settings. The US Department of Energy has stated that there is potential for energy saving in the magnitude of 90 Billion kWh by increasing home energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |title=Weatherization in Austin, Texas |publisher=Green Collar Operations |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803235602/http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |archivedate=2009-08-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have emphasized this. A report published in 2006 by the [[McKinsey Global Institute]], asserted that "there are sufficient economically viable opportunities for energy-productivity improvements that could keep global energy-demand growth at less than 1 percent per annum"—less than half of the 2.2 percent average growth anticipated through 2020 in a business-as-usual scenario.&lt;ref name= NYT292006&gt;{{cite news|title= Energy Use Can Be Cut by Efficiency, Survey Says.... |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/business/29energy.html |accessdate= November 29, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times |date= November 29, 2006|author= Steve Lohr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy productivity, which measures the output and quality of goods and services per unit of energy input, can come from either reducing the amount of energy required to produce something, or from increasing the quantity or quality of goods and services from the same amount of energy.

The [[Vienna Climate Change Talks 2007]] Report, under the auspices of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), clearly shows "that energy efficiency can achieve real emission reductions at low cost."&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/20070831_vienna_closing_press_release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International standard]]s ISO{{nbsp}}17743 and ISO{{nbsp}}17742 provide a documented methodology for calculating and reporting on energy savings and energy efficiency for countries and cities.&lt;ref name="iso-17743"&gt;

==Appliances==
{{See also|green computing|solar lamp|energy saving lamp|power usage effectiveness}}

Modern appliances, such as, [[freezers]], [[oven]]s, [[stove]]s, [[dishwasher]]s, and clothes washers and dryers, use significantly less energy than older appliances. Installing a clothesline will significantly reduce one's energy consumption as their dryer will be used less. Current energy-efficient refrigerators, for example, use 40 percent less energy than conventional models did in 2001. Following this, if all households in Europe changed their more than ten-year-old appliances into new ones, 20 billion kWh of electricity would be saved annually, hence reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by almost 18 billion kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |title=Ecosavings |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070945/http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |archivedate=2011-08-06 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the corresponding figures would be 17 billion kWh of electricity and {{convert|27000000000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electrolux.com/ecosavings_us |title=Ecosavings (Tm) Calculator |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 study from [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] the replacement of old appliances is one of the most efficient global measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=McKinsey Global Institute|title=Pathways to a Low-Carbon Economy: Version 2 of the Global Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Curve|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/sustainability/cost%20curve%20pdfs/pathways_lowcarbon_economy_version2.ashx|accessdate=February 16, 2016|page=7|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern power management systems also reduce energy usage by idle appliances by turning them off or putting them into a low-energy mode after a certain time. Many countries identify energy-efficient appliances using [[energy input labeling]].&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://www.eesi.org/buildings_efficiency_0506 |title=Energy-Efficient Buildings: Using whole building design to reduce energy consumption in homes and offices |publisher=Eesi.org |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of energy efficiency on peak demand depends on when the appliance is used. For example, an air conditioner uses more energy during the afternoon when it is hot. Therefore, an energy-efficient air conditioner will have a larger impact on peak demand than off-peak demand. An energy-efficient dishwasher, on the other hand, uses more energy during the late evening when people do their dishes. This appliance may have little to no impact on peak demand.

Buildings are an important field for energy efficiency improvements around the world because of their role as a major energy consumer. However, the question of energy use in buildings is not straightforward as the indoor conditions that can be achieved with energy use vary a lot. The measures that keep buildings comfortable, lighting, heating, cooling and ventilation, all consume energy. Typically the level of energy efficiency in a building is measured by dividing energy consumed with the floor area of the building which is referred to as specific energy consumption (SEC) or energy use intensity (EUI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=buildingcontest.eui]&lt;/ref&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac \text{Energy consumed}\text{Built area}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the issue is more complex as building materials have [[embodied energy]] in them. On the other hand, energy can be recovered from the materials when the building is dismantled by reusing materials or burning them for energy. Moreover, when the building is used, the indoor conditions can vary resulting in higher and lower quality indoor environments. Finally, overall efficiency is affected by the use of the building: is the building occupied most of the time and are spaces efficiently used — or is the building largely empty? It has even been suggested that for a more complete accounting of energy efficiency, SEC should be amended to include these factors:&lt;ref&gt;Juha Forsström, Pekka Lahti, Esa Pursiheimo, Miika Rämä, Jari Shemeikka, Kari Sipilä, Pekka Tuominen &amp; Irmeli Wahlgren (2011): [http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/tiedotteet/2011/T2581.pdf Measuring energy efficiency]. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{Embodied energy} + \text{Energy consumed} - \text{Energy recovered}}{\text{Built area} \times \text{Utilization rate} \times \text{Quality factor}}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a balanced approach to energy efficiency in buildings should be more comprehensive than simply trying to minimize energy consumed. Issues such as quality of indoor environment and efficiency of space use should be factored in. Thus the measures used to improve energy efficiency can take many different forms. Often they include passive measures that inherently reduce the need to use energy, such as better insulation. Many serve various functions improving the indoor conditions as well as reducing energy use, such as increased use of natural light.

A building's location and surroundings play a key role in regulating its temperature and illumination. For example, trees, landscaping, and hills can provide shade and block wind. In cooler climates, designing northern hemisphere buildings with south facing windows and southern hemisphere buildings with north facing windows increases the amount of sun (ultimately heat energy) entering the building, minimizing energy use, by maximizing [[passive solar heating]]. Tight building design, including energy-efficient windows, well-sealed doors, and additional thermal insulation of walls, basement slabs, and foundations can reduce heat loss by 25 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most heat is lost through the walls of your building, in fact about a third of all heat losses occur in this area. [https://www.simplybusinessenergy.co.uk/news/electricity-and-energy-cost-savings-for-small-businesses~188/ Simply Business Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark roofs may become up to 39&amp;nbsp;°C (70&amp;nbsp;°F) hotter than the most [[reflective surfaces (climate engineering)|reflective white surfaces]]. They transmit some of this additional heat inside the building. US Studies have shown that lightly colored roofs use 40 percent less energy for cooling than buildings with darker roofs. White roof systems save more energy in sunnier climates. Advanced electronic heating and cooling systems can moderate energy consumption and improve the comfort of people in the building.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Proper placement of windows and skylights as well as the use of architectural features that reflect light into a building can reduce the need for artificial lighting. Increased use of natural and task lighting has been shown by one study to increase productivity in schools and offices.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Newer fluorescent lights produce a natural light, and in most applications they are cost effective, despite their higher initial cost, with payback periods as low as a few months. [[LED lamp]]s use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Effective energy-efficient building design can include the use of low cost Passive Infra Reds (PIRs) to switch-off lighting when areas are unnoccupied such as toilets, corridors or even office areas out-of-hours. In addition, lux levels can be monitored using daylight sensors linked to the building's lighting scheme to switch on/off or dim the lighting to pre-defined levels to take into account the natural light and thus reduce consumption. Building Management Systems (BMS) link all of this together in one centralised computer to control the whole building's lighting and power requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Creating Energy Efficient Offices - Electrical Contractor Fit-out Article&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis that integrates a residential bottom-up simulation with an economic multi-sector model, it has been shown that variable heat gains caused by insulation and air-conditioning efficiency can have load-shifting effects that are not uniform on the electricity load. The study also highlighted the impact of higher household efficiency on the power generation capacity choices that are made by the power sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12053-015-9392-9 |title=Beyond the end-consumer: how would improvements in residential energy efficiency affect the power sector in Saudi Arabia? |year=2015 |last1=Matar |first1=W |journal=Energy Efficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of which space heating or cooling technology to use in buildings can have a significant impact on energy use and efficiency. For example, replacing an older 50% efficient [[furnace#Household furnaces|natural gas furnace]] with a new 95% efficient one will dramatically reduce energy use, carbon emissions, and winter natural gas bills. [[Ground source heat pump]]s can be even more energy-efficient and cost-effective. These systems use pumps and compressors to move refrigerant fluid around a thermodynamic cycle in order to "pump" heat against its natural flow from hot to cold, for the purpose of transferring heat into a building from the large thermal reservoir contained within the nearby ground. The end result is that heat pumps typically use four times less electrical energy to deliver an equivalent amount of heat than a direct electrical heater does. Another advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it can be reversed in summertime and operate to cool the air by transferring heat from the building to the ground. The disadvantage of ground source heat pumps is their high initial capital cost, but this is typically recouped within five to ten years as a result of lower energy use.

[[Smart meter]]s are slowly being adopted by the commercial sector to highlight to staff and for internal monitoring purposes the building's energy usage in a dynamic presentable format. The use of Power Quality Analysers can be introduced into an existing building to assess usage, harmonic distortion, peaks, swells and interruptions amongst others to ultimately make the building more energy-efficient. Often such meters communicate by using [[wireless sensor network]]s.

[[Green Building XML]] (gbXML) is an emerging schema, a subset of the [[Building Information Modeling]] efforts, focused on green building design and operation. gbXML is used as input in several energy simulation engines. But with the development of modern computer technology, a large number of [[building performance simulation]] tools are available on the market. When choosing which simulation tool to use in a project, the user must consider the tool's accuracy and reliability, considering the building information they have at hand, which will serve as input for the tool. Yezioro, Dong and Leite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.04.014 |title=An applied artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation tools |year=2008 |last1=Yezioro |first1=A |last2=Dong |first2=B |last3=Leite |first3=F |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=40 |issue=4 |page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3% of mean absolute error.

[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) is a rating system organized by the [[US Green Building Council]] (USGBC) to promote environmental responsibility in building design. They currently offer four levels of certification for existing buildings (LEED-EBOM) and new construction (LEED-NC) based on a building's compliance with the following criteria: [[Sustainable sites]], [[water efficiency]], energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LEED v4 for Building Design and Construction Checklist |url=http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150226000022/http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 February 2015 |website=USGBC |accessdate=29 April 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, USGBC developed the LEED Dynamic Plaque, a tool to track building performance against LEED metrics and a potential path to recertification. The following year, the council collaborated with [[Honeywell]] to pull data on energy and water use, as well as indoor air quality from a BAS to automatically update the plaque, providing a near-real-time view of performance. The USGBC office in [[Washington, D.C.]] is one of the first buildings to feature the live-updating LEED Dynamic Plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honeywell, USGBC Tool Monitors Building Sustainability|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/10/22/honeywell-usgbc-tool-monitors-building-sustainability/|website=Environmental Leader|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[deep energy retrofit]] is a whole-building analysis and construction process that uses to achieve much larger energy savings than conventional [[green retrofit|energy retrofits]]. Deep energy retrofits can be applied to both residential and non-residential (“commercial”) buildings. A deep energy retrofit typically results in energy savings of 30 percent or more, perhaps spread over several years, and may significantly improve the building value.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeancarassus.zumablog.com/images/2128_uploads/Fuerst_New_paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Building]] has undergone a deep energy retrofit process that was completed in 2013. The project team, consisting of representatives from [[Johnson Controls]], [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], [[Clinton Climate Initiative]], and [[Jones Lang LaSalle]] will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38% and $4.4 million.&lt;ref name=ESB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esbnyc.com/sustainability_energy_efficiency.asp |title=Visit &gt; Sustainability &amp; Energy Efficiency &amp;#124; Empire State Building |publisher=Esbnyc.com |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into [[superwindow]]s which block heat but pass light. [[Air conditioning]] operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved $17 million of the project's capital cost immediately, partly funding other retrofitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |work=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving a gold [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)]] rating in September 2011, the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States.&lt;ref name="inhabitat1"/&gt;
The [[Indianapolis City-County Building]] recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process, which has achieved an annual energy reduction of 46% and $750,000 annual energy saving.

Energy retrofits, including deep, and other types undertaken in residential, commercial or industrial locations are generally supported through various forms of financing or incentives. Incentives include pre-packaged rebates where the buyer/user may not even be aware that the item being used has been rebated or "bought down". "Upstream" or "Midstream" buy downs are common for efficient lighting products. Other rebates are more explicit and transparent to the end user through the use of formal applications. In addition to rebates, which may be offered through government or utility programs, governments sometimes offer tax incentives for energy efficiency projects. Some entities offer rebate and payment guidance and facilitation services that enable energy end use customers tap into rebate and incentive programs.

To evaluate the economic soundness of energy efficiency investments in buildings, [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] or CEA can be used. A CEA calculation will produce the value of energy saved, sometimes called ''[[negawatt]]s'', in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Thus CEA allows comparing the price of negawatts with price of energy such as electricity from the grid or the cheapest renewable alternative. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Tuominen, Francesco Reda, Waled Dawoud, Bahaa Elboshy, Ghada Elshafei, Abdelazim Negm: [http://doi.org/10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00195-1 Economic Appraisal of Energy Efficiency in Buildings Using Cost-effectiveness Assessment].

==Energy efficiency by country==

===Europe===
{{See also|Energy efficiency in Europe (study)}}
{{Expand section|proper text and additional citations|date=June 2016}}

Energy efficiency targets for 2020 and 2030.

The first EU-wide target was set in 1998. Member states agreed to improve energy efficiency by 1 percent a year over twelve years. In addition, legislation about products, industry, transport and buildings has contributed to a general energy efficiency framework. More effort is needed to address heating and cooling: there is more heat wasted during electricity production in Europe than is required to heat all buildings in the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heatroadmap.eu/|title=Heat Roadmap Europe|website=www.heatroadmap.eu|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, EU energy efficiency legislation is estimated to deliver savings worth the equivalent of up to 326 million tons of oil per year by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU set itself a [[EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012|20% energy savings target]] by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, but member states decide individually how energy savings will be achieved. At an EU summit in October 2014, EU countries agreed on a new energy efficiency target of 27% or greater by 2030. One mechanism used to achieve the target of 27% is the 'Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates|url=http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/energyefficiency/white-certificates|website=Europa.EU|publisher=Europa.eu|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing debate around the 2016 Clean Energy Package also puts an emphasis on energy efficiency, but the goal will probably remain around 30% greater efficiency compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that this will not be enough for the EU to meet its Paris Agreement goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels.

===Australia===
The [[Australian national government]] is actively leading the country in efforts to increase their energy efficiency, mainly through the government's [[Department of Industry and Science]]. In July 2009, the [[Council of Australian Governments]], which represents the individual states and territories of Australia, agreed to a National Strategy on Energy Efficiency (NSEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=National Strategy on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Industry.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913191712/http://www.industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a ten-year plan accelerate the implementation of a nationwide adoption of energy-efficient practices and a preparation for the country's transformation into a [[low carbon]] future. There are several different areas of energy use addressed within the NSEE. But, the chapter devoted to the approach on energy efficiency that is to be adopted on a national level stresses four points in achieving stated levels of energy efficiency. They are:
*To help households and businesses transition to a low carbon future
*To streamline the adoption of efficient energy
*To make buildings more energy-efficient
*For governments to work in partnership and lead the way to energy efficiency

The overriding agreement that governs this strategy is the National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Fif.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://www.federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312005515/http://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-12 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This document also explains the role of both the [[commonwealth]] and the individual states and territories in the NSEE, as well provides for the creation of benchmarks and measurement devices which will transparently show the nation's progress in relation to the stated goals, and addresses the need for funding of the strategy in order to enable it to move forward.

===Canada===

In August 2017, the Government of Canada released [https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/emmc/pdf/Building_Smart_en.pdf Build Smart - Canada's Buildings Strategy], as a key driver of the [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework.html Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change], Canada's national climate strategy.

The Build Smart strategy seeks to dramatically increase the energy-efficiency performance of existing and new Canadian buildings, and establishes five goals to that end:
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a “net-zero energy ready” model building code by 2030.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop a model code for existing buildings by 2022, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt the code.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work together with the aim of requiring labelling of building energy use by as early as 2019.
*The federal government will set new standards for heating equipment and other key technologies to the highest level of efficiency that is economically and technically achievable.
*Provincial and territorial governments will work to sustain and expand efforts to retrofit existing buildings by supporting energy efficiency improvements and by accelerating the adoption of high-efficiency equipment while tailoring their programs to regional circumstances.

The strategy details a range of activities the Government of Canada will pursue, and investments it will make, in support of the goals. As of early 2018, only one of Canada's 10 provinces and three territories, British Columbia, has developed a policy in support of federal government's goal to reach net zero energy ready ambitions: the [[BC Energy Step Code]].

Local British Columbia governments may use the BC Energy Step Code, if they wish, to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new construction that goes above and beyond the requirements of the base building code. The regulation and standard is designed as a technical roadmap to help the province reach its target that all new buildings will attain a net zero energy ready level of performance by 2032.

Efforts to reduce final energy consumption in transport sector have not been successful, with a growth of 1.7% between 2005–2014. This growth is due to both road passenger and road freight transport. Both sectors increased their overall distance travelled to record the highest figures ever for Germany. Rebound effects played a significant role, both between improved vehicle efficiency and the distance travelled, and between improved vehicle efficiency and an increase in vehicle weights and engine power.&lt;ref name="loeschel-etal-2015"&gt;

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency. The policy contains both immediate and forward-looking measures. The central short-term measures of NAPE include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency, the raising of funding for building renovation, the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector, and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry. German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.

On 12 August 2016, the German government released a [[green paper]] on energy efficiency for public consultation (in German).&lt;ref name="bmwi-2016-press-release"&gt;

A 2011 [[Energy Modeling Forum]] study covering the United States examines how energy efficiency opportunities will shape future fuel and electricity demand over the next several decades. The US economy is already set to lower its energy and carbon intensity, but explicit policies will be necessary to meet climate goals. These policies include: a carbon tax, mandated standards for more efficient appliances, buildings and vehicles, and subsidies or reductions in the upfront costs of new more energy-efficient equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Industry==
Industries use a large amount of energy to power a diverse range of manufacturing and resource extraction processes. Many industrial processes require large amounts of heat and mechanical power, most of which is delivered as [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|petroleum fuels]], and [[electricity]]. In addition some industries generate fuel from waste products that can be used to provide additional energy.

Because industrial processes are so diverse it is impossible to describe the multitude of possible opportunities for energy efficiency in industry. Many depend on the specific technologies and processes in use at each industrial facility. There are, however, a number of processes and energy services that are widely used in many industries.

Various industries generate [[steam]] and electricity for subsequent use within their facilities. When electricity is generated, the heat that is produced as a by-product can be captured and used for process steam, heating or other industrial purposes. Conventional electricity generation is about 30% efficient, whereas combined heat and power (also called [[co-generation]]) converts up to 90 percent of the fuel into usable energy.&lt;ref name=indust&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://ladoma.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Energy-Efficiency-Fact-Sheet.pdf |title=Industrial Energy Efficiency: Using new technologies to reduce energy use in industry and manufacturing |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced boilers and furnaces can operate at higher temperatures while burning less fuel. These technologies are more efficient and produce fewer pollutants.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

Over 45 percent of the fuel used by US manufacturers is burnt to make steam. The typical industrial facility can reduce this energy usage 20 percent (according to the [[US Department of Energy]]) by insulating steam and condensate return lines, stopping steam leakage, and maintaining steam traps.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s usually run at a constant speed, but a [[variable speed drives|variable speed drive]] allows the motor's energy output to match the required load. This achieves energy savings ranging from 3 to 60 percent, depending on how the motor is used. Motor coils made of [[superconducting]] materials can also reduce energy losses.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt; Motors may also benefit from [[voltage optimisation]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Industry uses a large number of [[pumps]] and [[compressors]] of all shapes and sizes and in a wide variety of applications. The efficiency of pumps and compressors depends on many factors but often improvements can be made by implementing better [[process control]] and better maintenance practices. Compressors are commonly used to provide [[compressed air]] which is used for sand blasting, painting, and other power tools. According to the US Department of Energy, optimizing compressed air systems by installing variable speed drives, along with preventive maintenance to detect and fix air leaks, can improve energy efficiency 20 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

==Transportation==
{{Main|Energy efficiency in transportation}}

===Automobiles===
{{Main|Fuel economy in automobiles}}

[[File:NYPD Traffic Enforcement RMP In White.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Prius]] used by [[NYPD#Traffic Enforcement|NYPD Traffic Enforcement]]]]

The estimated energy efficiency for an automobile is 280 Passenger-Mile/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Btu.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Dorf, ''The Energy Factbook'', McGraw-Hill, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways to enhance a vehicle's energy efficiency. Using improved [[aerodynamics]] to minimize drag can increase vehicle [[fuel efficiency]]. Reducing vehicle weight can also improve fuel economy, which is why [[composite materials]] are widely used in car bodies.

More advanced tires, with decreased tire to road friction and rolling resistance, can save gasoline. Fuel economy can be improved by up to 3.3% by keeping tires inflated to the correct pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.shtml |title=Tips to improve your Gas Mileage |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing a clogged air filter can improve a cars fuel consumption by as much as 10 percent on older vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On newer vehicles (1980s and up) with fuel-injected, computer-controlled engines, a clogged air filter has no effect on mpg but replacing it may improve acceleration by 6-11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/pdfs/Air_Filter_Effects_02_26_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Aerodynamics also aid in efficiency of a vehicle. The design of a car impacts the amount of gas needed to move it through air. Aerodynamics involves the air around the car, which can affect the efficiency of the energy expended. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/what-makes-a-car-fuel-efficient|title=What Makes a Fuel Efficient Car? The 8 Most Fuel Efficient Cars|work=CarsDirect|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turbocharger]]s can increase fuel efficiency by allowing a smaller displacement engine. The 'Engine of the year 2011' is a Fiat 500 engine equipped with an MHI turbocharger. "Compared with a 1.2-liter 8v engine, the new 85 HP turbo has 23% more power and a 30% better performance index. The performance of the two-cylinder is not only equivalent to a 1.4-liter 16v engine, but fuel consumption is 30% lower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat 875cc TwinAir named International Engine of the Year 2011|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/fiat-20110520.html|website=Green Car Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy-efficient vehicles may reach twice the fuel efficiency of the average automobile. Cutting-edge designs, such as the diesel [[Mercedes-Benz Bionic]] concept vehicle have achieved a fuel efficiency as high as {{convert|84|mpgus}}, four times the current conventional automotive average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pd{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream trend in automotive efficiency is the rise of [[electric vehicle]]s (all@electric or hybrid electric). Hybrids, like the [[Toyota Prius]], use [[regenerative braking]] to recapture energy that would dissipate in normal cars; the effect is especially pronounced in city driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nom * |url=https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |title=La Prius de Toyota, une référence des voitures hybrides &amp;#124; L'énergie en questions |publisher=Lenergieenquestions.fr |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017080726/https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plug-in hybrid]]s also have increased battery capacity, which makes it possible to drive for limited distances without burning any gasoline; in this case, energy efficiency is dictated by whatever process (such as coal-burning, hydroelectric, or renewable source) created the power. Plug-ins can typically drive for around {{convert|40|mi}} purely on electricity without recharging; if the battery runs low, a gas engine kicks in allowing for extended range. Finally, all-electric cars are also growing in popularity; the [[Tesla Model S]] sedan is the only high-performance all-electric car currently on the market.

===Street lighting===
Cities around the globe light up millions of streets with 300 million lights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/2763639/global_led_and_smart_street_lighting_market&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities are seeking to reduce [[street light]] power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours or switching to LED lamps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/on_your_streets/street-lighting.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the high luminous efficiency of LEDs will lead to real reductions in energy, as cities may end up installing extra lamps or lighting areas more brightly than in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C. C. M.|last2=Hänel|first2=A.|last3=Hölker|first3=F.|title=Redefining efficiency for outdoor lighting|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2014|volume=7|issue=6|pages=1806|doi=10.1039/C4EE00566J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
{{Main|Fuel economy in aircraft|Environmental impact of aviation}}

There are several ways to reduce energy usage in air transportation, from modifications to the planes themselves, to how air traffic is managed. As in cars, turbochargers are an effective way to reduce energy consumption; however, instead of allowing for the use of a smaller-displacement engine, turbochargers in jet turbines operate by compressing the thinner air at higher altitudes. This allows the engine to operate as if it were at sea-level pressures while taking advantage of the reduced drag on the aircraft at higher altitudes.

Air traffic management systems are another way to increase the efficiency of not just the aircraft but the airline industry as a whole. New technology allows for superior automation of takeoff, landing, and collision avoidance, as well as within airports, from simple things like HVAC and lighting to more complex tasks such as security and scanning.

==Energy conservation==
{{Main|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Illust passive solar d1.gif|thumb|250px|right|Elements of [[Passive solar building design|passive solar energy design]], shown in a direct gain application]]

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in including active efforts to decrease energy consumption, for example through [[behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]], in addition to using energy more efficiently. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements are heating a room less in winter, using the car less, air-drying your clothes instead of using the dryer, or enabling energy saving modes on a computer. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, T. et al. (2009).[http://www.pnas.org/content/106/44/18452.full Household actions can provide a behavioral wedge to rapidly reduce US carbon emissions]. PNAS. 106(44).&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy conservation is a challenge requiring policy programmes, technological development and behavior change to go hand in hand. Many energy [[intermediary]] organisations, for example governmental or non-governmental organisations on local, regional, or national level, are working on often publicly funded programmes or projects to meet this challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Breukers, Heiskanen, et al. (2009). Interaction schemes for successful demand-side management. Deliverable 5 of the [http://www.energychange.info/index.php CHANGING BEHAVIOUR] project. Funded by the EC (#213217).&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have also engaged with the issue of energy conservation and have provided guidelines for realizing behavior change to reduce energy consumption while taking technological and policy considerations into account.&lt;ref&gt;Kok, G., Lo, S.H., Peters, G.J. &amp; R.A.C. Ruiter (2011), Changing Energy-Related Behavior: An Intervention Mapping Approach, Energy Policy, 39:9, 5280-5286, doi:10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.036&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory maintains a comprehensive list of apps useful for energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.openei.org/apps/ |title=National Renewable Energy Laboratory. (2012) |publisher=En.openei.org |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial property managers that plan and manage energy efficiency projects generally use a software platform to perform energy audits and to collaborate with contractors to understand their full range of options. The [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=622/pagename=alpha_list_sub Department of Energy (DOE) Software Directory] describes EnergyActio software, a cloud based platform designed for this purpose.

==Sustainable energy==
{{Main|Sustainable energy}}

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the “twin pillars” of a sustainable [[energy policy]]. Both strategies must be developed concurrently in order to stabilize and reduce [[carbon dioxide emissions]]. Efficient energy use is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising [[clean energy]] supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too rapidly, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total carbon emissions; a reduction in the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. A sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111000420/http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-11 |df=}}([[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as Lieef (www.Lieef.com) have started reporting ESG metrics on behalf of companies, and investment funds, in an effort to increase transparency in the space which to date has increased in importance, but has not found a unified measurement tool. In addition, the majority of companies that report sustainability do so on a 'net' basis, and do not reflect their carbon emissions, and separate those emissions from their activities that offset those emissions, such as buying renewable credits and green power..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Lieef.com/ |title=Lieef.com; Lieef inc |publisher=Lieef.com |date=2018-05-28 |accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebound effect==
{{Further|Rebound effect (conservation)|Jevons' paradox}}
If the demand for energy services remains constant, improving energy efficiency will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, many efficiency improvements do not reduce energy consumption by the amount predicted by simple engineering models. This is because they make energy services cheaper, and so consumption of those services increases. For example, since fuel efficient vehicles make travel cheaper, consumers may choose to drive farther, thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; These are examples of the direct [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]].&lt;ref name=direct&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/07/0710ReboundEffect/0710ReboundEffectReport.pdf The Rebound Effect: an assessment of the evidence for economy-wide energy savings from improved energy efficiency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910051917/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/07/0710ReboundEffect/0710ReboundEffectReport.pdf |date=2008-09-10}} pp. v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[radio astronomy]], a '''fast radio burst''' ('''FRB''') is a high-energy astrophysical phenomenon of unknown origin manifested as a transient [[Radio wave|radio]] pulse lasting a few milliseconds on average. The first FRB was discovered by Duncan Lorimer and his student David Narkevic in 2007 when they were looking through archival pulsar survey data, and it is therefore commonly referred to as '''Lorimer Burst'''.  Many FRBs have since been found, including a repeating FRB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Core Concept: Unraveling the enigma of fast radio bursts|first=Adam| last= Mann|journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date= 28 March 2017 |volume= 114|issue=13|pages=3269–3271| doi=  10.1073/pnas.1703512114 |pmid=28351957|pmc=5380068|bibcode=2017PNAS..114.3269M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AT-20170829" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NWSWK-20170830" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20180110"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Magnetic Secrets of Mysterious Radio Bursts in a Faraway Galaxy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/science/neutron-star-fast-radio-bursts.html |date=10 January 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=11 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact origin and cause is uncertain, they are almost definitely extragalactic.

==Nomenclature==

Fast radio bursts are named by the date the signal was recorded, as "FRB YYMMDD". The first fast radio burst to be described, the Lorimer Burst FRB 010724, was identified in 2007 in archived data recorded by the [[Parkes Observatory]] on 24 July 2001. Since then, most known FRBs have been found in previously recorded data. On 19 January 2015, astronomers at Australia's national science agency ([[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]]) reported that a fast radio burst had been observed for the first time live, by the Parkes Observatory.&lt;ref name=RAS2015&gt;{{cite web| title=Cosmic radio burst caught red-handed| url=https://www.ras.org.uk/news-and-press/2578-cosmic-radio-burst-caught-red-handed| website=Royal Astronomical Society| date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

Fast radio bursts are bright, unresolved (pointsource-like), broadband (spanning a large range of radio frequencies), millisecond flashes found in parts of the sky outside the Milky Way. Unlike many radio sources the signal from a burst is detected in a short period of time with enough strength to stand out from the noise floor. The burst usually appears as a single spike of energy without any change in its strength over time. The bursts last for a period of several milliseconds (thousandths of a second). The bursts come from all over the sky, and are not concentrated on the plane of the Milky Way. Known FRB locations are biased by the parts of the sky that the observatories can image.

===Frequencies and dispersion===

The component frequencies of each burst are delayed by different amounts of time depending on the [[wavelength]]. This delay is described by a value referred to as a [[dispersion measure]] (DM).&lt;ref name=lorimer2007 /&gt; This results in a received signal that sweeps rapidly down in frequency, as longer wavelengths are delayed more.

===Extragalactic origin===

Fast radio bursts have pulse dispersion measurements which are much larger (&gt; 100 [[Parsec|pc]] cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=Bannister2017/&gt;) than expected for a source inside the Milky Way;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dense magnetized plasma associated with a fast radio burst |journal=Nature |date=24 December 2015 |last=Masui |first=Kiyoshi |last2=Lin |first2=Hsiu-Hsien |last3=Sievers |first3=Sievers |volume=528 |issue=7583 |pages=523–525 |doi=10.1038/nature15769 |pmid=26633633 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7583/abs/nature15769.html |accessdate=2016-02-28 |arxiv = 1512.00529 |bibcode = 2015Natur.528..523M |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consistent with propagation through an ionized [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]],&lt;ref name=lorimer2007 /&gt; and furthermore their distribution is [[Isotropy|isotropic]] (not especially coming from the galactic plane),&lt;ref name=Caleb2017/&gt;{{rp|fig 3}} thus they are conjectured to be of extragalactic origin.

The [[interferometer]] [[UTMOST]] has also put a lower limit of 10,000 kilometers for the distance to the FRBs it has detected, supporting the case for an astronomical origin (because signal sources on Earth are ruled out as being closer than this limit).  This limit can be determined from the fact that closer sources would have a curved wave front that could be detected by the multiple antennas of the interferometer.&lt;ref name=Caleb2017&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=1703.10173| last1= Caleb| first1= M.| title= The first interferometric detections of Fast Radio Bursts| journal= Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| volume= 468| issue= 3| pages= 3746| last2=  Flynn| first2= C.| last3=  Bailes| first3= M.| last4=  Barr| first4= E.

== Lorimer Burst ==
The first FRB, the Lorimer Burst FRB 010724, was discovered in 2007 when Duncan Lorimer assigned his student David Narkevic to look through archival data taken in 2001 by the Parkes radio dish in Australia.&lt;ref name="McKee 2007"&gt;{{cite news |last=McKee |first=Maggie |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12699-extragalactic-radio-burst-puzzles-astronomers/ |title=Extragalactic radio burst puzzles astronomers |work=New Scientist |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=2015-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Analysis of the survey data found a 30-[[jansky]] [[Dispersion (optics)#Dispersion in pulsar timing|dispersed burst]] which occurred on 24 July 2001,&lt;ref name=lorimer2007&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5851/777?ck=nck |title=A Bright Millisecond Radio Burst of Extragalactic Origin |author=D.

The reported burst properties argue against a physical association with the [[Milky Way]] galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. The burst became known as the Lorimer Burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nphys2724 | title=No flash in the pan | journal=Nature Physics | date=2013 | volume=9 | issue=8 | pages=454 | first=May | last=Chiao|bibcode = 2013NatPh...9..454C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoverers argue that current models for the free electron content in the universe imply that the burst is less than 1 giga[[parsec]] distant. The fact that no further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or merger of relativistic objects.&lt;ref name=lorimer2007 /&gt; It is suggested that hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes.&lt;ref name=Lorimer2007B&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atnf.csiro.au/news/newsletter/oct07/MSburst.htm |title=A bright millisecond radio burst of extragalactic origin |author=Duncan Lorimer (West Virginia University, USA) |display-authors=4 |author2=Matthew Bailes (Swinburne University) |author3=Maura McLaughlin (West Virginia University, USA) |author4=David Narkevic (West Virginia University, USA) |author5=Fronefield Crawford (Franklin &amp; Marshall College, USA) | last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Australia Telescope National Facility |date=October 2007 |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 there was a report of 16 similar pulses: clearly of terrestrial origin; detected by the [[Parkes radio telescope]]; and given the name [[Peryton (astronomy)|perytons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1009.5392 |author1=Sarah Burke-Spolaor |author2=Matthew Bailes |author3=Ronald Ekers |author4=Jean-Pierre Macquart |author5=Fronefield Crawford III |title=Radio Bursts with Extragalactic Spectral Characteristics Show Terrestrial Origins |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=727 |issue=1 |pages=18 |date=2010|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/727/1/18 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...727...18B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 perytons were shown to be generated when microwave oven doors were suddenly opened during a heating cycle, with emission generated by the [[magnetron]].&lt;ref name=Petroff2015&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1504.02165|title=Identifying the source of perytons at the Parkes radio telescope|date=9 April 2015|bibcode = 2015MNRAS.451.3933P |doi = 10.1093/mnras/stv1242|volume=451|issue=4|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|pages=3933–3940|last1=Petroff|first1=E.|last2=Keane|first2=E.

==== FRB 121102 ====
An observation in 2012 of a fast radio burst (FRB 121102)&lt;ref name="NYT-20180110" /&gt; in the direction of [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]] in the northern hemisphere using the [[Arecibo radio telescope]] confirmed the extragalactic origin of fast radio pulses by an effect known as [[Dispersion (optics)#Dispersion in pulsar timing|plasma dispersion]].

In November 2015, astronomer Paul Scholz at [[McGill University]] in Canada, found ten non-periodically repeated fast radio pulses in archival data gathered in May and June 2015 by the Arecibo radio telescope.&lt;ref name="McGill"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chipello |first=Chris |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/mysterious-cosmic-radio-bursts-found-repeat-259440 |title=Mysterious cosmic radio bursts found to repeat |work=McGill University News |date=2 March 2016 |accessdate=2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ten bursts have dispersion measures and sky positions consistent with the original burst FRB 121102, detected in 2012.&lt;ref name="McGill" /&gt; Like the 2012 burst, the 10 bursts have a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] dispersion measure that is three times larger than possible for a source in the [[Milky Way]] Galaxy.

== Origin hypotheses ==
Because of the isolated nature of the observed phenomenon, the nature of the source remains speculative. {{As of|2016}}, there is no generally accepted explanation. The source is estimated to be no larger than a few hundred kilometers in size because of [[Causality (physics)|causality]] (the bursts last for only a few milliseconds). If the bursts come from cosmological distances, their sources must be very energetic,&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-brilliant-flash-then-nothing-new-fast-radio-bursts-mystify-astronomers/|title=A Brilliant Flash, Then Nothing: New "Fast Radio Bursts" Mystify Astronomers|journal=[[Scientific American]]|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to the amount released by the Sun in 80 years.&lt;ref name="SPC-20181010"/&gt;

[[File:Friends Ambulance Unit ambulance driver, with his vehicle in Wolfsburg, Germany.jpg|thumb|Frank J. Stevens, a Friends Ambulance Unit ambulance driver, with his vehicle in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany, possibly 1945]]
The '''Friends' Ambulance Unit''' (FAU) was a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] [[ambulance|ambulance service]], founded by individual members of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), in line with their [[Peace Testimony]]. The FAU operated from 1914–1919, 1939–1946 and 1946–1959 in 25 different countries around the world. It was independent of the Quakers' organisation and chiefly staffed by registered [[conscientious objector]]s.

==History==

===First World War===
[[File:FAU1914-1918 plate11 Bethune EProcter.jpg|thumb|Civilian hospital evacuation at [[Béthune]], [[Pas-de-Calais]] during the First World War; drawing by FAU volunteer [[Ernest Procter]]]]
The Unit was founded as '''The First Anglo-Belgian Ambulance Unit''' at the start of [[World War I]] in 1914 and later renamed the Friends' Ambulance Unit. Members were trained at [[Jordans, Buckinghamshire|Jordans]], a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], that was  a centre for [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakerism]]. Altogether it sent over a thousand men to [[France]] and [[Belgium]], where they worked on ambulance convoys and ambulance trains with the French and British armies. The FAU came under the jurisdiction of the [[British Red Cross Society]]. It was dissolved in 1919.

===Second World War and aftermath===
It was refounded by a committee of former members at the start of [[World War II]] in September 1939 with the establishment of a training camp at Manor Farm, Bristol Road, [[Northfield, West Midlands|Northfield]], [[Birmingham]]. More than 1,300 members were trained and went on to serve as ambulance drivers and medical orderlies in [[London]] during [[the Blitz]], as well as overseas in [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] (1940), the [[Middle East]] (1940–1943), [[Greece]] (1941, 1944–1946), [[China]] and [[Syria]] (1941–1946), [[India]] and [[Ethiopia]] (1942–1945), [[Italy]] (1943–1946), [[France]], Belgium, [[Netherlands]], [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Germany]] (1944–1946) and [[Austria]] (1945–1946).

====China Convoy====
The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] had led to deteriorating conditions in China and in 1941 agreement was reached for the FAU to deploy 40 volunteers to deliver medical aid (dubbed the "China Convoy"). At first, their job was to secure the delivery of supplies via the "[[Burma Road]]", the sole remaining route. When [[Burma]] fell to the Japanese in May 1942, the FAU volunteers escaped to India and China. They regrouped and took on the distribution of medical supplies delivered by "[[The Hump]]", the air transport route to [[Kunming]]. It is estimated that 80% of medical supplies to China were distributed by the FAU.

The FAU's role expanded and they provided a range medical treatments, preventative measures and training of Chinese medical personnel. This expanded further into the reconstruction of medical facilities, notably the hospital at [[Tengchong]] in 1944, and into agricultural improvements and training.&lt;ref name=qia&gt;{{cite web | title=The FAU China Convoy (1941–46) | work=Quakers in the World | date= | url=http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/309 | accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activities in China were international, employing personnel, men and women, from Britain (the largest national group), China, United States, Canada, New Zealand and elsewhere. Around 200 foreigners took part, eight died and others had their health permanently damaged. About half of the recruits were Quakers but all had a commitment to pacifism and wished to deliver practical help.&lt;ref name=qia /&gt;

Responsibility for the relief work in China was passed to the [[American Friends Service Committee]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=qia /&gt;

====Northern Europe====
Two 12-man sections with eight vehicles, FAU Relief Sections Nos 1 and 2, landed at [[Arromanches]], [[Normandy]] on 6 September 1944 from a [[tank landing craft]]. Attached to the British Army's civilian affairs branch, the FAU sections provided relief to civilians in Normandy. No 2 FAU was then posted to a newly liberated refugee camp at [[Leopoldsburg]], Belgium, managing reception, registration, disinfection, catering, dormitories and departures.

In November 1944, in response to a request from [[21st Army Group]], a further five more sections were established and arrived in Europe at the end of 1944. One new member was [[Gerald Gardiner]], who subsequently became [[Lord Chancellor]] in [[Harold Wilson]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of 1964–1970.

After a period in [[Nijmegen]], assisting local civilian medical organisations during [[Operation Market Garden]], No 2 FAU cared for a colony of the mentally ill near [[Cleves]] in Germany which grew to a population of 25,000. By April, the main work had become the accommodation and care of [[displaced persons]] until they could return home.  No 2 FAU  was heavily involved with the care and support of inmates at the newly liberated [[Stalag X-B]] [[prisoner-of-war]] camp near [[Sandbostel]], between [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]] in northern Germany in May 1945.

The FAU was wound up in 1946 and replaced by the '''Friends Ambulance Unit Post-War Service''', which continued until 1959.

The work of the Friends' Ambulance Unit was referred to in the 1947 award of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to Quakers worldwide and accepted by the [[Friends Service Council]] and the [[American Friends Service Committee]].

==Purpose==
The original trainees in the 1939 training camp issued a statement expressing their purpose:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We purpose to train ourselves as an efficient Unit to undertake ambulance and relief work in areas under both civilian and military control, and so, by working as a pacifist and civilian body where the need is greatest, to demonstrate the efficacy of co-operating to build up a new world rather than fighting to destroy the old.

While respecting the views of those pacifists who feel they cannot join an organization such as our own, we feel concerned among the bitterness and conflicting ideologies of the present situation to build up a record of goodwill and positive service, hoping that this will help to keep uppermost in men's minds those values which are so often forgotten in war and immediately afterwards.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Geothermal heating''' is the direct use of [[geothermal energy]] for some heating applications. Humans have taken advantage of [[geothermal]] heat this way since the Paleolithic era. Approximately seventy countries made direct use of a total of 270 [[petajoule|PJ]] of geothermal heating in 2004. As of 2007, 28 [[gigawatt|GW]] of geothermal heating capacity is installed around the world, satisfying 0.07% of global primary energy consumption.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; [[Thermal efficiency]] is high since no energy conversion is needed, but [[capacity factor]]s tend to be low (around 20%) since the heat is mostly needed in the winter.

[[geothermal (geology)|Geothermal energy]] originates from the heat retained within the Earth since the original formation of the planet, from [[radioactive decay]] of minerals, and from [[solar energy]] absorbed at the surface.&lt;ref name="heatpumps9-3"&gt;{{Citation |title=Heat Pumps, Energy Management and Conservation Handbook, 2008|pages=9–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most high temperature geothermal heat is harvested in regions close to [[tectonic plate boundaries]] where volcanic activity rises close to the surface of the Earth. In these areas, ground and groundwater can be found with temperatures higher than the target temperature of the application. However, even cold ground contains heat, below {{convert|6|m}} the undisturbed ground temperature is consistently at the Mean Annual Air Temperature&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/Mean_Annual_Air_Temperature.html Mean Annual Air Temperature]&lt;/ref&gt; and it may be extracted with a [[heat pump]].

There are a wide variety of applications for cheap geothermal heat. In 2004 more than half of direct geothermal heat was used for space heating, and a third was used for spas.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;{{Citation|first1=Ingvar B.|last1=Fridleifsson,|first2=Ruggero|last2=Bertani|first3=Ernst|last3=Huenges|first4=John W.|last4=Lund|first5=Arni|last5=Ragnarsson|first6=Ladislaus|last6=Rybach|date=2008-02-11|title=The possible role and contribution of geothermal energy to the mitigation of climate change|conference=IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources|editor=O.

The cities of [[Reykjavík]] and [[Akureyri]] pipe hot water from geothermal plants under roads and pavements to melt snow. [[Geothermal desalination]] has been demonstrated.

Geothermal systems tend to benefit from economies of scale, so space heating power is often distributed to multiple buildings, sometimes whole communities. This technique, long practiced throughout the world in locations such as [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]],&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Rochester]] - History of the utilization of geothermal sources of energy in Iceland, ''http://www.energy.rochester.edu/is/reyk/history.htm''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boise]], [[Idaho]],&lt;ref&gt;District Heating Systems in Idaho, ''http://www.idwr.state.id.us/energy/alternative_fuels/geothermal/detailed_district.htm''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Klamath Falls]], [[Oregon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geothermie.de/egec-geothernet/ci_prof/america/usa/klamath_falls_geothermal_distric.htm Klamath Falls Geothermal District Heating Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025405/http://www.geothermie.de/egec-geothernet/ci_prof/america/usa/klamath_falls_geothermal_distric.htm |date=2008-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is known as [[district heating]].&lt;ref name="EERE1" /&gt;

== Extraction ==
{{Main|Ground-coupled heat exchanger}}

Some parts of the world, including substantial portions of the western USA, are underlain by relatively shallow geothermal resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geothermal.org/what.html What is Geothermal?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004048/http://www.geothermal.org/what.html |date=October 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conditions exist in Iceland, parts of Japan, and other geothermal hot spots around the world. In these areas, water or steam may be captured from natural [[hot springs]] and piped directly into [[radiators]] or [[heat exchanger]]s. Alternatively, the heat may come from [[waste heat]] supplied by [[co-generation]] from a geothermal electrical plant or from deep wells into hot aquifers. Direct geothermal heating is far more efficient than geothermal electricity generation and has less demanding temperature requirements, so it is viable over a large geographical range. If the shallow ground is hot but dry, air or water may be circulated through [[earth tubes]] or [[downhole heat exchanger]]s which act as heat exchangers with the ground.

[[Supercritical fluid|Steam under pressure]] from deep geothermal resources is also used to generate electricity from geothermal power. The [[Iceland Deep Drilling Project]] struck a pocket of magma at 2,100m. A cemented steelcase was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma. The high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam  were used to generate 36MW of electricity, making IDDP-1 the world’s first magma-enhanced geothermal system.&lt;ref name="Geothermics Magazine, Vol. 49 (January 2014)"&gt;{{cite book |title=Geothermics Magazine, Vol. 49 (January 2014)|author=Wilfred Allan Elders, Guðmundur Ómar Friðleifsson and Bjarni Pálsson|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03756505/49/supp/C |year=2014 |publisher=Elsevier Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas where the shallow ground is too cold to provide comfort directly, it is still warmer than the winter air. The [[thermal inertia]] of the shallow ground retains solar&lt;!--article is about geothermal, not solar--&gt; energy accumulated in the summertime, and seasonal variations in ground temperature disappear completely below 10m of depth. That heat can be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more efficiently than it can be generated by conventional furnaces.&lt;ref name="EERE1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html |title=Geothermal Basics Overview |publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate=2008-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004020606/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geothermal heat pumps are economically viable essentially anywhere in the world.

In theory, geothermal energy (usually cooling) can also be extracted from existing infrastructure, such as municipal water pipes.&lt;ref name="Google Books 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Tadayon | first1=Saied | last2=Tadayon | first2=Bijan | last3=Martin | first3=David | title=Patent US20120255706 - Heat Exchange Using Underground Water System | date=2012-10-11 | url=https://www.google.com/patents/US20120255706 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ground-source heat pumps ==
{{Main|Geothermal heat pump}}
In regions without any high temperature geothermal resources, a [[geothermal heat pump|ground-source heat pump]] (GSHP) can provide space heating and space cooling. Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a heat pump to force the transfer of heat from the ground to the building. Heat can be extracted from any source, no matter how cold, but a warmer source allows higher efficiency. A ground-source heat pump uses the shallow ground or ground water (typically starting at {{convert|10|-|12|C|F|disp=or}}) as a source of heat, thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderate temperatures.&lt;ref name="heatpumps9-4"&gt;[[Dharendra Yogi Goswami|Goswami, Yogi D.]], [[Frank Kreith|Kreith, Frank]], Johnson, Katherine (2008), p. 9-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an [[air-source heat pump]] draws heat from the air (colder outside air) and thus requires more energy.

Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) are ''not'' geothermal, i.e. there is no geyser providing heat to be captured. A GSHP merely accesses stored solar heat energy in the soil or rock.  GSHPs circulate a carrier fluid (usually a mixture of water and small amounts of antifreeze) through closed pipe loops buried in the ground. Single-home systems can be "vertical loop field" systems with bore holes {{convert|50|-|400|ft|m|sigfig=2}} deep &lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/wells/geothermal.html&lt;/ref&gt; or, if adequate land is available for extensive trenches, a "horizontal loop field" is installed approximately six feet subsurface. As the fluid circulates underground it absorbs heat from the ground and, on its return, the warmed fluid passes through the heat pump which uses electricity to extract heat from the fluid. The re-chilled fluid is sent back into the ground thus continuing the cycle. The heat extracted and that generated by the heat pump appliance as a byproduct is used to heat the house. The addition of the ground heating loop in the energy equation means that significantly more heat can be transferred to a building than if electricity alone had been used directly for heating.

Switching the direction of heat flow, the same system can be used to circulate the cooled water through the house for cooling in the summer months. The heat is exhausted to the relatively cooler ground (or groundwater) rather than delivering it to the hot outside air as an air conditioner does. As a result, the heat is pumped across a larger temperature difference and this leads to higher efficiency and lower energy use.&lt;ref name="heatpumps9-4"/&gt;

This technology makes ground source heating economically viable in any geographical location. In 2004, an estimated million ground-source heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 GW extracted 88 PJ of heat energy for space heating. Global ground-source heat pump capacity is growing by 10% annually.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt;

[[Image:Oldest geothermal.jpg|thumb|right|The oldest known pool fed by a hot spring, built in the Qin dynasty in the 3rd century BC.]]

[[Hot springs]] have been used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cataldi | first = Raffaele | date =August 1993 | title =Review of historiographic aspects of geothermal energy in the Mediterranean and Mesoamerican areas prior to the Modern Age | journal =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | location=Klamath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =15 | issue =1 | pages = 13–16 | url=http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/bulletin/bi046.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known spa is a stone pool on [[China]]'s [[Mount Li]] built in the [[Qin dynasty]] in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the [[Huaqing Chi]] palace was later built.

In 1892, America's first district heating system in [[Boise, Idaho]] was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was soon copied in [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]] in 1900. A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Dickson |first1=Mary H. |last2=Fanelli |first2=Mario |date=February 2004 |title=What is Geothermal Energy? |publisher=Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse |location=Pisa, Italy |url=http://iga.igg.cnr.it/index.php |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009080651/http://iga.igg.cnr.it/index.php |archivedate=2009-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlie Lieb developed the first [[downhole heat exchanger]] in 1930 to heat his house. Steam and hot water from the geysers began to be used to heat homes in Iceland in 1943.

By this time, [[Lord Kelvin]] had already invented the [[heat pump]] in 1852, and [[Heinrich Zoelly]] had patented the idea of using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912.&lt;ref name="zogg"&gt;{{Cite conference | first = M. | last = Zogg  | url = http://www.zogg-engineering.ch/Publi/IEA_HPC08_Zogg.pdf | title = History of Heat Pumps: Swiss Contributions and International Milestones  | publisher = 9th International IEA Heat Pump Conference | date = 20–22 May 2008 | location = Zürich, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until the late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented.

== Economics ==
[[Image:Geothermaldrilling.jpg|thumb|right|Geothermal drill machine.]]

Geothermal energy is a type of renewable energy that encourages conservation of natural resources. According to the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], [[geo-exchange]] systems save homeowners 30–70 percent in heating costs, and 20–50 percent in cooling costs, compared to conventional systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium, Inc. |url=http://geoexchange.us/about/how.htm |accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geo-exchange systems also save money because they require much less maintenance. In addition to being highly reliable they are built to last for decades.

Some utilities, such as [[Kansas City Power and Light]], offer special, lower winter rates for geothermal customers, offering even more savings.&lt;ref name="heatpumps9-4"/&gt;

==Geothermal drilling  risks==
[[File:Staufen.Cracks.jpg|thumb|Cracks at the historic Town Hall of [[Staufen im Breisgau]] presumed due to damage from geothermal drilling]]

In geothermal heating projects the underground is penetrated by trenches or drillholes. As with all underground work, projects may cause problems if the geology of the area is poorly understood.

In the spring of 2007 an exploratory geothermal drilling operation was conducted to provide geothermal heat to the town hall of [[Staufen im Breisgau]]. After initially sinking a few millimeters, a process called [[subsidence]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1583323/Geothermal-probe-sinks-German-city.html The Telegraph: Geothermal probe sinks German city (March 31, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;  the city center has started to rise gradually&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,589944,00.html Spiegel.de report on recent geological changes] (in German, partial [http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2008/11/town-rips-up.html translation])&lt;/ref&gt; causing considerable damage to buildings in the city center, affecting numerous historic houses including the town hall.  It is hypothesized that the drilling perforated an [[anhydrite]] layer bringing high-pressure [[groundwater]] to come into contact with the anhydrite, which then began to expand.  Currently no end to the rising process is in sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://carsologica.zrc-sazu.si/downloads/392/Sass.pdf |title=DAMAGE TO THE HISTORIC TOWN OF STAUFEN (GERMANy) CAUSED By GEOTHERMAL DRILLINGS THROUGH ANHyDRITE-BEARING FORMATIONS |first=A |last=FORMACIJE |journal=Acta Carsologica |year=2010 |page=233 |volume=39 |issue=2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813041725/http://carsologica.zrc-sazu.si/downloads/392/Sass.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00767-010-0154-5 | last1 = Butscher | first1 = Christoph | last2 = Huggenberger | first2 = Peter | last3 = Auckenthaler | first3 = Adrian | last4 = Bänninger | first4 = Dominik | title = Risikoorientierte Bewilligung von Erdwärmesonden  | journal = Grundwasser | year = 2010 | volume = 16 | pages = 13–24| bibcode = 2011Grund..16...13B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1007/s10040-009-0458-7 | last1 =Goldscheider | first1 =Nico | last2 =Bechtel | first2 =Timothy D. | title =Editors’ message: The housing crisis from underground—damage to a historic town by geothermal drillings through anhydrite, Staufen, Germany |  journal =Hydrogeology Journal | volume =17 | pages =491–493 | year =2009 | issue =3| bibcode =2009HydJ...17..491G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the [[TerraSAR-X]] radar satellite before and after the changes  confirmed the localised nature of the situation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A geochemical process called [[anhydrite]] swelling has been confirmed as the cause of these [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]s. This is a transformation of the mineral anhydrite (anhydrous calcium sulphate) into [[gypsum]] (hydrous calcium sulphate). A pre-condition for this transformation is that the anhydrite is in contact with water, which is then stored in its crystalline structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacemart.com/reports/TerraSAR_X_Image_Of_The_Month_Ground_Uplift_Under_Staufen_Old_Town_999.html TerraSAR-X Image Of The Month: Ground Uplift Under Staufen's Old Town], [[TerraSAR-X]] [[radar]] satellite, [www.spacemart.com], 2009-10-22, accessed 2009-10-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Guadalquivir Marshes''' (in {{lang-es|Marismas del Guadalquivir}} or simply ''Las Marismas'') are a [[natural region]] of [[wetlands|marshy lowlands]] on the lower [[Guadalquivir River]]. 

The ''Las Marismas'' zone forms a large part of the [[Huelva (province)|province of Huelva]], [[Seville (province)|province of Seville]] and [[Cádiz (province)|province of Cádiz]] in [[Andalucia]], [[Spain]]. The area includes parts of the municipalities of [[Isla Mayor]], [[Los Palacios y Villafranca]], [[La Puebla del Río]], [[Utrera]], [[Las Cabezas de San Juan]]  and [[Lebrija]].

Rice farming in this area produces 40% of Spain's national crop. Some areas are protected for wildlife and habitat, including dunes.

==History==
Approximately two [[millennia]] ago the [[wetland]]s comprised a large [[lagoon]] and [[estuary]], known as '''''Lacus Ligustinus''''' in [[Latin language|Latin]], leading to the [[Guadalquivir]] [[River mouth]] with some sand bars to the South. Over time the [[lake]] silted up, gradually transforming into [[marsh]]land.&lt;ref name="RR"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cambios Paleoambientales en la desembocadura del río Guadalquivir durante el Holoceno reciente.|journal=Geogaceta|author=F. Ruiz|author2=A. Rodríguez-Ramírez|volume=32|publisher=Sociedad Geológica de España|pages=167–170|url=http://www.sociedadgeologica.es/archivos/geogacetas/Geo31/Art42.pdf|issn=|year=2002|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This silt has formed into a barrier of dunes extending approximately {{Convert|70|km}} along the coast, known as ''Arenas Gordas'' (English: "the fat sands").&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt;

The [[marquessate]] [[Marquess de las Marismas del Guadalquivir|de las Marismas del Guadalquivir]] is a [[Spanish nobility|Spanish noble title]] named after the area; this [[noble title]] was created by [[Royal Decree]] of [[King Ferdinand VII]] in 1829 for [[Alejandro María Aguado, 1st Marquis of the Guadalquivir Marshes|Alejandro María Aguado y Ramírez de Estenoz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneall.net/H/tit_page.php?id=8696 ''Marquesado de las Marismas del Guadalquivir - Real Decreto de 20 de mayo de 1829'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 21st century, the Guadalquivir wetland region's main economic activity is [[agriculture]], specialising in the cultivation of [[rice]]. An area of about 400&amp;nbsp;km² is devoted to [[rice farming]]. It has an annual output of about 310,000 metric tonnes, equating to approximately 40% of Spain's rice production.

==Protected area==
{{main|Doñana National Park}}
The wetland zone acts as a [[edge effect|buffer zone]] between the human settlements of the [[Guadalquivir]] region and [[Doñana National Park]], a [[protected area]] of [[marsh]]land, [[stream]]s, and [[sand dune]]s. The National Park was established in 1969 as a [[nature reserve]] when the [[World Wildlife Fund]] joined forces with the [[Spanish Government]] to purchase a substantial part of the local wetlands in order to preserve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For a living planet|url=http://www.wwf.be/_media/wwf_50_years_ddd__lrsm_777081.pdf|publisher=WWF-World Wide Fund For Nature (formerly World Wildlife Fund)|accessdate=6 April 2014|author=WWF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621114020/http://www.wwf.be/_media/wwf_50_years_ddd__lrsm_777081.pdf|archivedate=June 21, 2012|location=Gland, Switzerland|date=April 2011|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fauna ==
The Las Marismas area is home to a large number of wildlife species. Commonly seen terrestrial animals include [[deer]], [[lynx]], and [[Wild boar|wild boars]]. Notable avian species include [[Vulture|vultures]], [[Flamingo|flamingos]], [[Heron|herons]], [[Spoonbill|spoonbills]], and [[Duck|ducks]]. The rare [[Spanish imperial eagle]] lives here, whose population is considered [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=231|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect''' (after [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]]) is a perceptual phenomenon wherein the intense [[saturation (color theory)|saturation]] of [[visible spectrum|spectral]] [[hue]] is perceived as part of the [[color]]'s [[luminance]]. This brightness increase by saturation, which grows stronger as saturation increases, might better be called [[chromaticity|chromatic]] luminance, since "white" or achromatic luminance is the standard of comparison. It appears in both self-luminous and surface colors, although it is most pronounced in spectral lights.
[[File:Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect.svg|thumb|Each color on top has approximately the same luminance level and yet they do not look the same. When the top image is converted to grayscale, we have the image on the bottom.]]

==Lightness==
Even when they have the same [[luminance]], colored lights seem brighter to human observers than white light does. The way humans perceive the brightness of the lights will be different for everyone. When the colors are more saturated, our eyes interpret it as the color's luminance and chroma. This makes us believe that the colors are actually brighter. An exception to this is when the human observer is red-green [[colorblind]], they cannot distinguish the differences between the lightness of the colors. Certain colors do not have significant effect, however, any hue of colored lights still seem brighter than white light that has the same luminance. Two colors that do not have as great of an Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect as the others are green and yellow.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{Cite web |last1= Wood |first1= Mike |title=Lightness – The Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect |website=Out of the Wood |date=2012 |url=http://www.mikewoodconsulting.com/articles/Protocol%20Summer%202012%20-%20HK%20Effect.pdf |accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect is affected by the viewing environment. This includes the surroundings of the object and the lighting that the object is being viewed under. The Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect works best in darker environments where there are not any other outside factors influencing the colors. For example, this is why theaters are all dark environments.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt;

An example of this lightness factor would be if there were different colors on a grey background that all are of the same lightness. Obviously the colors look different because they are different colors not just grey, but if the image were converted all to grey scale, all of the colors would match the grey background because they all have the same lightness.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt;

==Brightness==
[[Brightness]] is affected most by what is surrounding the object. In other words, the object can look lighter or darker depending on what is around it. In addition, the brightness can also appear different depending on the color of the object. For example, an object that is more saturated will look brighter than the same object that is less saturated even when they have the same luminance.&lt;ref name=ness&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Brightness of Colour | pmc=2659800 | pmid=19333398 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005091 | volume=4 | issue=3 | year=2009 | journal=PLoS ONE | pages=e5091 | last1 = Corney | first1 = D | last2 = Haynes | first2 = JD | last3 = Rees | first3 = G | last4 = Lotto | first4 = RB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between brightness and lightness is that the brightness is the intensity of the object independent of the light source. Lightness is the brightness of the object in respect to the light reflecting on it. This is important because the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect is a measure of the ratio between the two.&lt;ref name=ness/&gt;

==Helmholtz Color Coordinates==
Similar to the [[Munsell Color System]], Helmholtz designed a [[coordinate system]]. He used the principals of [[wavelength]] and purity ([[chrominance|chroma]]) of the color for each hue to describe the location of when high saturation indicates a small amount of white.&lt;ref name="Donofrio"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Donofrio |first1=Robert L. |title=Review Paper: The Helmholtz-Kohlrausch Effect |journal=Journal of the Society for Information Display |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=658 |date=2011 |doi=10.1889/JSID19.10.658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of purity for each wavelength can be determined by the equation below:

: &lt;math&gt; %P = 100 \cdot (S-N)/(DW-N) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Donofrio"/&gt;

Where %P is the percent of purity, S is the point being assessed, N is the position of the white point, and DW the dominant wavelength.&lt;ref name="Donofrio"/&gt;

==Effects on the entertainment industry==
It is essential for lighting users to be aware of the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect when working in theaters or in other venues where lighting is often used. In order to get the greatest effect to illuminate their stage or theater, the lighting users need to understand that color has an effect on brightness. For example, one color may appear brighter than another but really they have the same brightness. On stage, lighting users have the ability to make the colored lights appear much brighter than the white light by adding gels. This occurs even though gels can only absorb some of the light.&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt; When lighting a stage, the lighting users tend to choose reds, pinks, and blues because they are highly saturated colors and are really very dim. However, we perceive them as being brighter than the other colors because they are most affected by the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect. We perceive that the color white does not look any brighter to us than individual colors. [[LED]] lights are a good example of this.

===LEDs===
The Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect influences the use of LED lights in different technological practices. [[Aviation]] is one field that relies upon the results of the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect. A comparison of runway LED lamps and filtered and unfiltered incandescent lights all at the same luminance shows that in order to accomplish the same brightness, the white reference incandescent lamp needs to have twice the luminance of the red LED lamp, therefore suggesting that the LED lights do appear to have a greater brightness than the traditional incandescent lights. One condition that affects this theory is the presence of fog.&lt;ref name="Donofrio"/&gt;

Another field that uses this is the automotive industry. LEDs in the dashboard and instrument lighting are designed for use in [[mesopic]] luminance. In studies, it has been found that red LEDs appear brighter than green LEDs, which means that a driver would be able to see red light before the green lights when driving at night.&lt;ref name="Donofrio"/&gt;

'''International Association for Energy Economics''' ('''IAEE''') is an international [[non-profit]] society of professionals interested in [[energy economics]]. IAEE was founded in 1977, in the period of the [[energy crisis]], when it became obvious that lack of knowledge on energy economics is one of the problems when dealing with the short- and long-term issues of energy supply and demand. IAEE is incorporated under United States laws and has headquarters in [[Cleveland]]. 

The IAEE operates through a 17 member Council of elected and appointed members. Council and officer members serve in a voluntary position.

The IAEE publishes ''[[The Energy Journal]]'', the policy oriented journal ''Economics of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/eeepjournal.aspx|title=International Association for Energy Economics :: Economics of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy|website=www.iaee.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the IAEE Forum newsletter.

IAEE has over 4,500 members worldwide (in over 100 countries). There are over 25 national chapters, in countries where membership exceeds 25 individual members. Some of the regularly active national chapters of the IAEE are: [[USAEE]] - United States; GEE - Germany; BIEE - Great Britain; AEE - France; AIEE - Italy.

== History ==
In the middle to late 1970s, in the post-[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] and post-oil embargo era in the U.S., energy controversies had become very heated and lacked much economic content. Jim Plummer had just moved from the federal government to Occidental Petroleum. He observed that there were talented energy economists in private industry, in academia, and in government, but these energy economists did not have many opportunities to meet or exchange ideas in a neutral environment free of suspicions.

Plummer approached the American Economics Association and asked them to provide a room for an organizing session at its meetings in January 1977 in [[New York City|New York City.]] The only room they had available seated 125 people. Plummer did not want to have a small group huddled in a corner of the large room, so he quickly promoted the meeting to many energy economists. To his surprise, there was standing room only in the room at the start of the meeting.

The initial dues level was $10 and the checks poured in to the first Treasurer, Richard Richels. Membership was soon about 300 and growing rapidly. In 1978, Plummer asked Mike Telson to put together the first annual meeting in June 1979 in Washington, D.C. Telson, as the senior Capitol Hill staff member for the House Energy Committee was a natural choice because his job was to know who was knowledgeable on particular energy issues.

The number of people with organizing responsibilities grew rapidly, and included Bill Hughes, Joy Dunkerley, Bill Johnson, Sam Schurr, Denny Ellerman, Joan Greenwood, Fred Abel, Richard Gordon, Milt Russell, Bill Hogan, Walter Meade, Les Deman, and Dennis O'Brien. The 1979 Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. featured James Schlesinger, Secretary of Energy, as the keynote speaker.

The first Vice President for Publications was Professor Ed Erickson of [[North Carolina State University]]. From the beginning, the Council wanted the organization to either have its own journal or affiliate with an established journal. Erickson solicited proposals from existing journals, as well as universities that might wish to host a new journal. Professor Helmut Frank at the University of Arizona convinced his university to subsidize a new journal. That proposal was accepted. There was much debate about potential names for the new journal. Ed Erickson lobbied forcefully for a broad name, and his proposal for The Energy Journal was accepted. If Ed Erickson should be considered the "founder" of The Energy Journal in the sense of spearheading its formation, then Helmut Frank, its founding editor, has to be considered the soul of the The Energy Journal. He threw himself into that role with so much enthusiasm and integrity that he has continued to be an inspiration to all those who have ever since been involved with the journal.

Sam Schurr was the first elected. President of the organization, Jim Plummer the second, and Professor Morris Adelman of M.I.T. the third. Sam Schurr of Resources for the Future had a career and publications that straddled the public sector, academia, and industry. His prestige and support were instrumental in establishing the credibility of the organization in its early days.

The organization was initially named the Association of Energy Economists, but quickly adopted the broader name of the International Association of Energy Economists. Finally, in recognition that its membership included many engineers, physicists, geologists and others that were not formally economists, the name was further broadened to be the International Association for Energy Economics. The international reputation of Professor Morris Adelman helped the organization achieve a reputation outside the U.S. Among the Canadians that actively participated early on were Campbell Watkins of the [[University of Calgary]] and Leonard Waverman of the [[University of Toronto]].

Wishing to "jump the Atlantic," Jim Plummer used his business trips to London to cultivate British energy economists. The most prominent British energy economists to respond were Jane Carter, the Assistant Secretary for Conservation of the U.K. Energy Department and Paul Tempest of the Bank of England. They were quickly followed by Robert Deam, Tony Scanlan, Richard Eden, David Newbery, Robert Mabro and many others. The IAEE had already held two international conferences in Toronto and Calgary, but its international conference at Churchill College, in Cambridge, in the summer of 1980, really established its international credentials. Paul Tempest was the chairman of that conference.

As the IAEE spread internationally, beyond its initial U.S./Canadian/U.K. roots, there were many individuals that provided support and guidance, including Kenichi Matsui, Alirio Parra, Mariano Gurfinkel, Fereidun Fesharaki, and R.K. Pachauri.

Today, the IAEE has members in over 100 nations and 27 organized affiliates. It holds multiple conferences each year in cities around the world. The IAEE prides itself as being a place where younger energy economists can quickly learn about the literature and people sources in every subfield of energy economics and also obtain mentoring from energy economists with decades of experience.

== Publications ==
The International Association for Energy Economics publishes three publications throughout the year:  

* ''[[The Energy Journal]]'', a quarterly academic publication 
* the ''Economics of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy,'' a semi annual publication 
* the ''Energy Forum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/|title=International Association for Energy Economics :: Publications|website=www.iaee.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Conferences ==
The IAEE conferences address critical issues of vital concern and importance to governments and industries and provide a forum where policy issues are presented, considered and discussed at both formal sessions and informal social functions.

IAEE typically holds five Conferences each year.The main annual [[Academic conference|conference]] for IAEE is the ''IAEE International Conference'' that is organized at diverse locations around the world. From year 1996 on these conferences have taken place (or will take place) in the following cities:

'''Kystagerparken''' is a park located in [[Hvidovre]], [[Denmark]], it borders [[Kalveboderne]], the waters between [[Zealand]] and [[Amager]]. The nearest station is [[Åmarken station|Åmarken]].&lt;ref name="hvidovre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oplev.hvidovre.dk/rundt-i-byen/ud-i-det-groenne/kystagerparken-og-bjerget.aspx|title=Kystagerparken og Bjerget|language=Danish|accessdate=21 March 2014|publisher=Hvidovre Municipality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kystagerparken is just one of several connected parks and green spaces in and around Hvidovre and link to areas such as Strandengen, Mågeparken, [[Vestvolden]], Rebæk Søpark, [[Valbyparken]] and Vigerslevparken to name some.

== History ==

The artificial hill of 'Bjerget' (English: ''The Mountain'') in the park, was constructed from excess dirt from the excavations at [[Kongens Bryghus]] in [[Frederiksberg]] in 1957. Kystagerparken has a status as a [[wildlife reserve]] and became an EU protected [[bird sanctuary]] in 1994. The grass is allowed to grow freely and the many wild flowers, seeds and plants provides habitat for insects, [[shrew]], [[skylark]], [[fox]]es and the [[common kestrel]].&lt;ref name="hvidovre" /&gt;

== Activities in the park ==
Kystagerparken invites to a number of activities throughout the year:&lt;ref name="hvidovre" /&gt;

A [[Solar system model]] on a scale of 1:1,000,000,000 stretches through the park to Mågeparken - another park nearby. The [[planet]] path reaches from the [[Sun]] on the hill of 'Bjerget', to the outermost planet [[Pluto]] 5.9&amp;nbsp;km away. In 2000, when the planet path was constructed as a public [[elementary school]] project, Pluto was still considered a planet. Each planet is cast in [[bronze]] and placed in the correct distance relative to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oplev.hvidovre.dk/rundt-i-byen/ud-i-det-groenne/planetstien.aspx|title=Planetstien|publisher=Hvidovre Municipality|language=Danish|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn, when stronger winds blow across the country, the hill of 'Bjerget' is considered an excellent place for flying [[kites]]. During snowfall in winter, it facilitates activities like [[sledding]] and on [[Easter Day]] in the spring, the Cultural Council of Hvidovre arrange "egg rolling" for kids here; an old Danish Easter tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4194">A '''Liljequist parhelion''' is a rare [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], an [[optical phenomenon]] in the form of a brightened spot on the [[parhelic circle]] approximately 150–160° from the [[sun]]; i.e., between the position of the [[120° parhelion]] and the [[anthelion]].

While the sun touches the horizon, a Liljequist parhelion is located approximately 160° from the sun and is about 10° long.  As the sun rises up to 30° the phenomenon gradually moves towards 150°, and as the sun reaches over 30° the optical effect vanishes.  The parhelia are caused by light rays passing through oriented [[plate crystal]]s.&lt;ref name="Pekkola-Riikonen"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the 120° parhelia, the Liljequist parhelia display a white-bluish colour.  This colour is, however, associated with the parhelic circle itself, not the [[ice crystal]]s causing the Liljequist parhelia.

The phenomenon was first observed by [[Gösta Hjalmar Liljequist]] in 1951 at [[Maudheim Station|Maudheim]], [[Antarctica]] during the [[Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] in 1949–1952.  It was then simulated by Dr. Eberhard Tränkle (1937–1997) and Robert Greenler in 1987 and theoretically explained by Walter Tape in 1994.&lt;ref name="Pekkola-Riikonen" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\theta_{{\rm L}1}=2\arccos\left(n\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3} - \alpha_{\rm TIR}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

where the refractive index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to use for the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\rm TIR}=\arcsin(1/n)&lt;/math&gt; of total internal reflection is Bravais' index for inclined rays, i.e. &lt;math&gt;n(e)=\sqrt{n^2-\sin\left(e\right)^2}/\cos\left(e\right)&lt;/math&gt; for a solar elevation &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. For ice at zero solar elevation this angle is &lt;math&gt;\theta_{{\rm L}1}\approx 153^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;. The dispersion of ice causes a variation of this angle, leading to a blueish/cyan coloring close to this azimuthal coordinate. The halo ends towards the anthelion at an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_{{\rm L}2}^{\rm max}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\theta_{{\rm L}2}^{\rm max}=\frac{5\pi}{6} + \arcsin\left(n\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-\alpha_{\rm TIR}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Ramsar Convention]] (formally, the ''Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat'') is an international [[treaty]] for the conservation and sustainable utilization of [[wetland]]s,&lt;ref name=ramsar&gt;[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/ramsar/display/main/main.jsp?zn=ramsar&amp;cp=1_4000_0__ Ramsar official website], retrieved 2011-07-10&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing the fundamental [[Ecology|ecological]] functions  of wetlands and their economic, cultural, scientific, and recreational value.  It is named after the city of [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]] in [[Iran]], where the Convention was signed in 1971.

The [[Philippines]] enforced the Ramsar Convention in its whole territory on November 8, 1994. Since then, Ramsar has designated 7 Ramsar sites in the country. Two Ramsar sites in the Philippines have been declared by [[UNESCO]] as [[world heritage sites]], namely [[Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park]], and [[Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ramsar.org/wetland/philippines&lt;/ref&gt;

A national inventory of wetland resources, based on the best scientific information available, is mandated by the Convention since 1990 through Recom 4.6. A Framework for Wetland Inventory was also established by the Convention in 2002 to aid member states in establishing their own national inventory for wetland sites. The inventory makes it possible to prioritize appropriate wetland sites for designation on the Ramsar List, similar to the tentative list of UNESCO, where UNESCO sites must always come from the tentative list. There is currently no publicly disclosed wetland inventory in the Philippines, but it is assumed that such inventory exists as the Philippines, through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, has already nominated at least seven Philippine wetlands since 1994.

The current representation of the Philippines in Ramsar wetland nominations is inactive compared with the Ramsar wetland nominations of its peers. By comparison, the Philippines has 7 sites, while Mexico has more than 140, the archipelagic country of Japan has more than 50, the African nation of Algeria has more than 50, and the small country of South Korea has 22. The Philippines, an archipelagic country, theoretically possesses more wetlands than South Korea and North Korea combined. This has prompted various scholars to push the government to participate more in the nominations of Philippine wetlands in the Ramsar Convention. By rule, the Philippines may nominate multiple sites as Ramsar sites like what Mexico did in 2008, where at least 45 of its nominated sites were specifically declared as new Ramsar sites.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ramsar.org/sites-countries/designating-ramsar-sites&lt;/ref&gt;

==The early Earth and the solar system==
* How did Earth and other planets form? Were planets formed in situ? Or are orbital changes relatively frequent? What determined the different deep layering of the solar planets?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinnon|first1=W. B.|title=The Strangest Terrestrial Planet|journal=Science|date=12 April 2012|volume=336|issue=6078|pages=162–163|doi=10.1126/science.1220825|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6078/162.summary|pmid=22499928|bibcode=2012Sci...336..162M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Was there ever a collision of the Earth with another planet Theia, giving birth to our satellite?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canup|first1=R. M.|title=Forming a Moon with an Earth-like Composition via a Giant Impact|journal=Science|date=17 October 2012|volume=338|issue=6110|pages=1052–1055|doi=10.1126/science.1226073|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1052.abstract|pmid=23076098|bibcode=2012Sci...338.1052C}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is compelling evidence, such as measures of a shorter duration of the Earth's rotation and lunar month in the past, pointing to a Moon much closer to Earth during the early stages of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Williams|title=Upper Proterozoic Tidal Rhythmites, South Australia: Sedimentary Features, Deposition, and Implications for the Earth’s Paleorotation|journal=Clastic Tidal Sedimentology - Memoir 16, 1991|date=1991|pages=161–177|url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/cspg_sp/data/016/016001/161_cspgsp0160161.htm|accessdate=3 March 2015|publisher=CSPG Special Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* What is the long-term heat balance of Earth? How did its internal temperature decay since it formed by accretion of chondrites? How abundant are radiogenic elements in the interior? Did a "[[faint young Sun paradox|faint young Sun]]" ever warm a "[[snowball Earth]]"? &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/space/was-earth-a-migratory-planet-120418.htm Wired: Was the Earth a migratory planet?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marty|first1=B.|last2=Zimmermann|first2=L.|last3=Pujol|first3=M.|last4=Burgess|first4=R.|last5=Philippot|first5=P.|title=Nitrogen Isotopic Composition and Density of the Archean Atmosphere|journal=Science|date=19 September 2013|volume=342|issue=6154|pages=101–104|doi=10.1126/science.1240971|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/101|pmid=24051244|arxiv=1405.6337|bibcode=2013Sci...342..101M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Is the crust still growing or does its recycling compensate for crust formation at mid-ocean ridges and other volcanic areas?

==Topography and environment==
*Can the now widely available topographic data be used to derive past tectonic and climatic conditions (in the multi-million year scale)? Do we know enough about the erosion and transport processes? Does the stochasticity of meteorological and tectonic events reflect in the landscape? How much has life contributed to shape the Earth's surface? 
*Can classical geomorphological concepts such as [[peneplanation]] or [[retrogressive erosion]] be quantitatively understood? Old mountain ranges such as the Appalachian or the Urals seem to retain relief for &gt;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; years, while subglacial fluvial valleys under Antarctica are preserved under moving ice of kilometric thickness since the [[Neogene]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1983">The '''Litang Horse Festival''' is a summer horse festival held in [[Litang County]], [[Sichuan]] province, China. [[Kham]]pas from all over the [[Tibetan Plateau]] come to trade, celebrate and ride. Khampas are [[nomad]]s that are Tibetan and are usually herders. The festival is held generally the first week in August, and it usually runs from August 1 to August 7. During the festival horsemanship and horse races are held upon the [[Tibetan Pony|Tibetan Ponies]]. These small and fast horses are raced and shown to see who owns the best horse. The horse festival is significant because it helps to establish socio-economic hierarchy in Khampas who participate. A lot of honor and prestige is placed on who owns the best horse. A very large tourism business has been built up on adventure trips and tours provided by companies who cater to individuals who are interested in horses and horsemanship. These companies travel around Tibet taking groups of tourists throughout the different villages hosting horse festivals. This benefits the nomads' economy as well as the rest of China's economy.

'''Mahishasura''' is both reviled as well as worshipped by sections of [[Hindus]]. For some, he was a buffalo demon in [[Hindu]] mythology whereas for many others he is a God.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiatoday.in/fyi/story/mahishasura-martyrdom-day-durga-puja-mahalaya-1047773-2017-09-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/not-just-durga-mahishasur-also-worshipped-in-india-116030100361_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; He is known among some sections of [[Hindus]] for his deception and as someone who pursued his evil ways by shape shifting into different forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theresa Bane|title=Encyclopedia of Demons in World Religions and Cultures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njDRfG6YVb8C&amp;pg=PA214|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8894-0|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazzone96/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p96"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kinsley| title=Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HzldwMHeS6IC |year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-90883-3|pages=96–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ultimately killed by [[Durga]] getting named  Mahishasuramardini. It is an important symbolic legend in Hindu mythology, particularly [[Shaktism]]. The legendary battle of Mahishasura as evil and Durga as good is narrated in many parts of South Asian and Southeast Asian Hindu temples, monuments and texts such as the ''[[Devi Mahatmya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James Ryan|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZET2sSUVsgC|year=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0816054589|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=191-192}}{{Sfn|June McDaniel|2004|pp=215-216, 219-220}} The story is also told in the Sikh text ''[[Chandi di Var]]'', also called ''Var Durga di'', which many in Sikh tradition believe was included in the ''[[Dasam Granth]]'' by [[Guru Gobind Singh]].&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p241"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

Many [[Dalit]] and [[Adivasi]] communities in [[Indian Subcontinent]] worship and believe in the power of Mahishasura. It is also believed by them that Mahishasura was an indigenous king who was killed during the invasion by the upper caste Hindus. Those who mourn Mahishasura's death believe he was portrayed as a 'demon king' by the Brahmins and upper caste Hindus who tops the charts of Hindu caste system hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiatoday.in/fyi/story/mahishasura-martyrdom-day-durga-puja-mahalaya-1047773-2017-09-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/not-just-durga-mahishasur-also-worshipped-in-india-116030100361_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==The legend of Mahishasura==
[[File:8th - 9th century Durga Mahishasuramardini killing the buffalo demon, Hindu temple ruins Sirpur Chhattisgarh 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|Durga killing Mahishasura, 9th century [[Sirpur Group of Monuments|Sirpur temple]], Chhattisgarh.]]
Mahishasura is a Sanskrit word composed of ''mahisha'' meaning buffalo and ''asura'' meaning demon, or "buffalo demon". As an Asura, Mahishasura waged war against the Devas, as the Devas and Asuras' were perpetually in conflict. Mahishasura had gained the boon that no man could kill him. In the battles between the gods and the demons, the Devas led by [[Indra]] were defeated by Mahishasura. Dejected by their defeat, the Devas assemble in the mountains where their combined divine energies coalesce into goddess [[Durga]]. The new born Durga led a battle against Mahishasura, riding a lion, and killed him. Thereafter she is named Mahishasuramardini, meaning "the killer of Mahishasura".&lt;ref name="Kinsley1988p96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p410"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC&amp;pg=PA410|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahishasura's legend is told in a major text of the [[Shaktism]] tradition known as the ''[[Devi Mahatmya]]''. He is described as an evil being who can change his outer form, but never his demonic goals.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p410"/&gt; According to Christopher Fuller, Mahishasura symbolically represents forces of ignorance and chaos hidden by outer appearances.&lt;ref name="Fuller2004p108"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher John Fuller|title=The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=To6XSeBUW3oC&amp;pg=PA108 |year=2004|publisher= Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12048-X|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazzone96/&gt; The symbolism is carried in Hindu arts found in South Asia and southeast Asia (Javanese artwork, for example), where Durga is shown as serene, calm, collected and graceful symbol of good as she pierces the heart and kills the scared, overwhelmed and outwitted Mahishasura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinrich Zimmer|title=Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJmFDPkwj50C&amp;pg=PA195|year=1990|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0751-8|pages=195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazzone96&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Amazzone|title=Goddess Durga and Sacred Female Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PM_TNDu8NHUC|year=2012|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-5314-5|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahishasura in Art==
Durga slaying Mahishasura is a prominent theme which was sculpted in various caves and temples across India. Some of the prominent representations are seen at the Mahishasuramardini caves in [[Mahabalipuram|Mahabalipram]], the [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] caves, in the entrance of [[Rani ki vav]]&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;{{cite web|last1=mahishasuramardini|title=Rani ki vav|url=http://www.frontline.in/arts-and-culture/heritage/a-queens-tribute/article6675794.ece|website=http://www.frontline.in/arts-and-culture/heritage/a-queens-tribute/article6675794.ece|publisher=frontline magazine|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoysaleswara Temple|Hoysaleswara]] Temple in Halebidu and many more temples across India.

==Mahishasura and Mysore==
{{double image|right|Durga Slays Mahisasura.jpg|220|Durga Temple Aihole ADSC 1481.jpg|111|Left: Buffalo-headed Mahishasura in Cave Temple, Mahabalipuram; Right: Mahishasura at Durga's foot in [[Aihole]] temple.}}
The popular legend is that [[Mysore district|Mysuru]] gets its name from [[Mahishasuramardini]], a manifestation of Goddess [[Durga]]. The Buffalo Demon Mahishasura, states the regional tradition, had terrified the local population. Goddess Durga killed the Mahishasura, an event that is annually celebrated at [[Navratri]] and [[Mysore Dasara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mysuru name|url=http://www.mysore.org.uk/mysore-history.html|website=http://www.mysore.org.uk/mysore-history.html|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple of the city’s guardian deity, [[Chamunda]], has a giant statue of Mahishasura on the hill facing the city. The earliest mention of Mysore in recorded history may be traced to 245 B.C., i.e., to the period of [[Ashoka]] when on the conclusion of the third Buddhist convocation, a team was dispatched to ''Mahisha mandala''.&lt;ref name="mysore"&gt;{{cite journal|title=DISTRICT CENSUS HANDBOOK MYSORE|journal=Census of India 2011 KARNATAKA|date=2011|volume=SERIES-30 PART XII-B|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/2923_PART_B_DCHB_MYSORE.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2016|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farallon Islands at inferior mirage no mirage and superior mirage.jpg|thumb|350px|Various kinds of mirages in one location taken over the course of six minutes, not shown in temporal order. The uppermost inset frame shows an inferior mirage of the [[Farallon Islands]]. The second inset frame is the Farallon Islands with a [[green flash]] on the left-hand side. The two lower frames and the main frame all show superior mirages of the Farallon Islands. In these three frames, the superior mirages evolve from a 3-image mirage (an inverted image between two erect ones) to a 5-image mirage, and then back to a 2-image mirage. Such a display is consistent with a [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]]. All frames but the upper one were photographed from about 50–70 feet above sea level. The upper frame was photographed from sea level.]]
A '''mirage''' is a naturally occurring [[optical phenomenon]] in which light rays bend to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. The word comes to English via the [[French language|French]] ''mirage'', from the [[Latin]] ''mirari'', meaning "to look at, to wonder at". This is the same root as for "[[mirror]]" and "to admire".

Mirages can be categorized as "inferior" (meaning lower), "superior" (meaning higher) and "[[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]]", one kind of superior mirage consisting of a series of unusually elaborate, vertically stacked images, which form one rapidly changing mirage.

In contrast to a [[hallucination]], a mirage is a real optical phenomenon that can be captured on camera, since light rays are actually refracted to form the false image at the observer's location. What the image appears to represent, however, is determined by the interpretive faculties of the human mind. For example, inferior images on land are very easily mistaken for the reflections from a small body of water.

==Inferior mirage==
[[File:Desertmirage.jpg|thumb|An inferior mirage on the [[Mojave Desert]] in spring]]

For exhausted travelers in the [[desert]], an inferior mirage may appear to be a lake of water in the distance. An inferior mirage is called "inferior" because the mirage is located under the real object. The real object in an inferior mirage is the (blue) sky or any distant (therefore bluish) object in that same direction. The mirage causes the observer to see a bright and bluish patch on the ground in the distance which is also called oasis mirage.

Light rays coming from a particular distant object all travel through nearly the same air layers and all are bent over about the same amount. Therefore, rays coming from the top of the object will arrive lower than those from the bottom. The image usually is upside down, enhancing the illusion that the sky image seen in the distance is really a water or oil puddle acting as a mirror.

Inferior images are not stable. Hot air rises, and cooler air (being more [[density|dense]]) descends, so the layers will mix, giving rise to turbulence. The image will be distorted accordingly. It may be vibrating; it may be vertically extended (towering) or horizontally extended (stooping). If there are several temperature layers, several mirages may mix, perhaps causing double images. In any case, mirages are usually not larger than about half a degree high (same apparent size as the sun and moon) and from objects only a few kilometers away.

===Heat haze===
[[File:Swiss F-5E at Fairford.JPG|thumb|Heat haze caused by jet engine exhaust]]
Heat haze, also called heat shimmer, refers to the inferior mirage experienced when viewing objects through a layer of heated air; for example, viewing objects across hot [[asphalt]] or through the exhaust gases produced by [[jet engine]]s. When appearing on roads due to the hot asphalt, it is often referred to as a highway mirage.

[[Convection]] causes the temperature of the air to vary, and the variation between the hot air at the surface of the road and the denser cool air above it creates a [[gradient index optics|gradient]] in the refractive index of the air. This produces a blurred shimmering effect, which affects the ability to resolve objects, the effect being increased when the image is magnified through a [[telescope]] or [[telephoto lens]].
[[File:Hot road mirage.jpg|thumb|left|A hot-road mirage, "fake water" on the road, the most common example of an inferior mirage]]
Light from the [[sky]] at a shallow angle to the road is [[refraction|refracted]] by the index gradient, making it appear as if the sky is reflected by the road's surface. The mind interprets this as a pool of water on the road, since water also reflects the sky. The illusion fades as one gets closer.

On [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]] roads it may look as if water, or even oil, has been spilled. These kinds of inferior mirages are often called "desert mirages" or "highway mirages". Both sand and tarmac can become very hot when exposed to the sun, easily being more than 10&amp;nbsp;°C hotter than the air one meter above, enough to create conditions suitable for the formation of the mirage.

Heat haze is not related to the atmospheric phenomenon of [[haze]].

==Superior mirage==
[[File:MirageAntarctique.jpg|thumb|Superior mirage: plane on ice, [[McMurdo Station]]]]
[[File:Cat Mirage.jpg|thumb|right|An artificial mirage, using sugar solutions to simulate the inversion layers. A cat is seen looking through a glass, which has three layers of solution, with decreasing [[refractive index]] from bottom to top. The cat appears in multiple images. This simulates an atmosphere with two inversion layers.]]
A superior mirage occurs when the air below the line of sight is colder than the air above it. This unusual arrangement is called a [[temperature inversion]], since warm air above cold air is the opposite of the normal temperature gradient of the atmosphere. Passing through the temperature inversion, the light rays are bent down, and so the image appears above the true object, hence the name ''superior''. Superior mirages are in general less common than inferior mirages, but, when they do occur, they tend to be more stable, as cold air has no tendency to move up and warm air has no tendency to move down.

Superior mirages are quite common in [[polar region]]s, especially over large sheets of ice that have a uniform low temperature. Superior mirages also occur at more moderate latitudes, although in those cases they are weaker and tend to be less smooth and stable. For example, a distant shoreline may appear to ''tower'' and look higher (and, thus, perhaps closer) than it really is. Because of the turbulence, there appear to be dancing spikes and towers. This type of mirage is also called the [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]] or ''hafgerdingar'' in the [[Icelandic language]].&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Color and Light in Nature |edition= 2nd |year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Abp5FdhskAC|author=David K. Lynch &amp; William Livingston|isbn=978-0-521-77504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A superior mirage can be right-side up or upside down, depending on the distance of the true object and the temperature gradient. Often the image appears as a distorted mixture of up and down parts.

Superior mirages can have a striking effect due to the Earth's curvature. Were the Earth flat, light rays that bend down would soon hit the ground and only nearby objects would be affected. Since Earth is round, if their downward bending curve is about the same as the [[Curvature|curvature of the Earth]], light rays can travel large distances, perhaps from beyond the horizon. This was observed and documented for the first time in 1596, when a ship under the command of [[Willem Barentsz]] in search of the [[Northeast passage]] became stuck in the ice at [[Novaya Zemlya]]. The crew was forced to endure the polar winter there. They saw their midwinter night come to an end with the rise of a distorted Sun about two weeks earlier than expected. It was not until the 20th century that science could explain the reason: the real Sun had still been below the horizon, but its light rays followed the curvature of the Earth. This effect is often called a [[Novaya Zemlya effect|Novaya Zemlya mirage]]. For every {{convert|111.12|km}} the light rays can travel parallel to the Earth's surface, the Sun will appear 1° higher on the horizon. The inversion layer must have just the right temperature gradient over the whole distance to make this possible.

In the same way, ships that are in reality so far away that they should not be visible above the geometric horizon may appear on the horizon or even above the horizon as superior mirages. This may explain some stories about flying ships or coastal cities in the sky, as described by some polar explorers. These are examples of so-called Arctic mirages, or ''hillingar'' in Icelandic.

If the vertical temperature gradient is +12.9&amp;nbsp;°C per 100 meters (where the positive sign means temperature gets hotter as one goes higher) then horizontal light rays will just follow the curvature of the Earth, and the horizon will appear flat. If the gradient is less (as it almost always is) the rays are not bent enough and get lost in space, which is the normal situation of a spherical, convex "horizon".

In some situations, distant objects can get [[Looming, Towering, Stooping, and Sinking|elevated or lowered, stretched or shortened]] with no mirage involved.

===Fata Morgana===
[[File:Farallons islands miragep.jpg|Sequence of a Fata Morgana of the [[Farallon Islands]] as seen from [[San Francisco]]|thumb]]
{{main|Fata Morgana (mirage)}}
A Fata Morgana, the name of which comes from the Italian translation of [[Morgan le Fay]], the fairy shapeshifting half-sister of King Arthur, is a very complex superior mirage. It appears with alternations of compressed and stretched areas, erect images, and inverted images.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"/&gt; A Fata Morgana is also a fast-changing mirage.

Fata Morgana mirages are most common in [[polar region]]s, especially over large sheets of ice with a uniform low temperature, but they can be observed almost anywhere. In polar regions, a Fata Morgana may be observed on cold days; in desert areas and over oceans and lakes, a Fata Morgana may be observed on hot days. For a Fata Morgana, [[temperature inversion]] has to be strong enough that light rays' curvatures within the inversion are stronger than the curvature of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/mirages/mirintro.html An Introduction to Mirages] by Andy Young&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2010|This editor was unable to find this claim at the link provided. Please check to see if this claim is verified at that link.}}

The rays will bend and create [[Arc (geometry)|arcs]]. An observer needs to be within an [[atmospheric duct]] to be able to see a Fata Morgana.&lt;ref name="Atmospheric Optics Glossary"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/glossary.html#duct SDSU.edu], "Atmospheric Optics Glossary" by Andy Young&lt;/ref&gt;
Fata Morgana mirages may be observed from any [[altitude]] within the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[atmosphere]], including from mountaintops or airplanes.&lt;ref name=" `SUPERIOR MIRAGE of cumulus cloudtop from airplane"&gt;{{cite book | title=Met. Mag. 85| last= Durst and Bull | year=1956| pages=237–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annotated bibliography of mirages, green flashes, atmospheric refraction, etc."&gt;{{cite book | title=Annotated bibliography of mirages, green flashes, atmospheric refraction, etc.| last= Andrew| first=Young| url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/bibliog/bibliog.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- {{Quotation|An unusual refraction phenomenon seen from a high-flying aircraft,&lt;br&gt;SUPERIOR MIRAGE of cumulus cloudtop from airplane  "Such phenomena as described in this paper do not appear to have been previously reported from aircraft in flight, unless some of the reports  of 'flying saucers' may have been due to this effect. }}--&gt;

A Fata Morgana can go from superior to inferior mirage and back within a few seconds, depending on the constantly changing conditions of the atmosphere. Sixteen frames of the mirage of the [[Farallon Islands]], which cannot be seen from sea level at all under normal conditions because they are located below the [[horizon]], were photographed on the same day. The first fourteen frames have elements of a Fata Morgana display—alternations of compressed and stretched zones.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"/&gt; The last two frames were photographed a few hours later around [[sunset]]. The air was cooler while the ocean was probably a little bit warmer, which made [[temperature inversion]] lower. The mirage was still present, but it was not as complex as it had been a few hours before sunset, and it corresponded no longer to a Fata Morgana but rather to a superior mirage display.

Distortions of image and bending of light can produce spectacular effects. In his book ''Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the "Bismarck"'', the author Ludovic Kennedy describes an incident that allegedly took place below the Denmark Strait during 1941, following the sinking of the ''Hood''. The ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]'', while pursued by the British cruisers ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'', passed out of sight into a sea mist. Within a matter of seconds, the ship re-appeared steaming toward the British ships at high speed. In alarm the cruisers separated, anticipating an imminent attack, and observers from both ships watched in astonishment as the German battleship fluttered, grew indistinct and faded away. Radar watch during these events indicated that the ''Bismarck'' had in fact made no changes of course.

==Night-time mirages==
The conditions for producing a mirage can take place at night. Under most conditions, these are not observed. However, under some circumstances lights from moving vehicles, aircraft, ships, buildings, etc. can be observed at night, even though, as with a daytime mirage, they would not be observable.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;

This includes the mirage of astronomical objects.

===Mirage of astronomical objects===
{{main|Mirage of astronomical objects}}
A mirage of an astronomical object is a naturally occurring [[optical phenomenon]], in which light rays are bent to produce distorted or multiple images of an [[astronomical object]]. The mirages might be observed for such astronomical objects as the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], the [[planet]]s, bright [[star]]s, and very bright [[comet]]s. The most commonly observed are [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]] mirages.

A '''mirage of an astronomical object''' is an [[atmospheric optics|atmospheric]] [[optical phenomenon]], in which light [[ray (optics)|rays]] are bent to produce [[distortion|distorted]] or multiple images of an [[astronomical object]]. The [[mirage]]s might be observed for such celestial objects as the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], the [[planet]]s, bright [[star]]s, and very bright [[comet]]s. The most commonly observed of these are [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]] mirages.

==Mirages versus refraction==
[[Mirage]]s are distinguished from [[looming and similar refraction phenomena|other phenomena]] caused by [[atmospheric refraction]]. One of the most prominent features of mirages is that a mirage might only produce images [[horizontal and vertical|vertically]], not sideways, while a simple refraction might distort and bend the images in any way.

The [[distortion]] in both images displayed in this section was caused by [[refraction]], but while the image on the left, which is a mirage, demonstrates only vertical distortion, the image on the right demonstrates distortion in all the ways possible. It is easier to see the vertical direction of the mirage not even at the mirage of the [[Sun]] itself, but rather at the mirage of a [[sunspot]]. As a matter of fact, it is at least a three-image mirage of a sunspot, and all these images show a clear vertical direction.

==Inferior mirage of astronomical objects==
[[Image:Inferior mirage of sunset comet.jpg|Inferior mirage of comet [[C/2006 P1]] McNaught|150px|thumb|left]]
[[Image:Sunset inferio mirage.jpg|Etruscan vase stage of inferior mirage sunset in [[Hawaii]]|thumb|150px]]
[[Image:Omega Sun inferior mirage.jpg|Omega Sun stage of inferior mirage sunset in [[Hawaii]]|thumb|150px]]
Inferior mirage of [[astronomical object]]s is the most common mirage. Inferior mirage occurs when the surface of the [[Earth]] or the [[ocean]]s produces a layer of hot air of lower density, just at the surface. There are two images, the inverted one and the erect one, in inferior mirage.They both are displaced from the [[geometric direction]] to the actual object. While the erect image is setting, the inverted image appears to be rising from the surface.

The shapes of inferior mirage sunsets and sunrises stay the same for all inferior mirage sunsets and sunrises. One well-known shape, the Etruscan vase, was named by [[Jules Verne]].&lt;ref name="Jules Verne page 305"&gt;{{cite book | author = Jules Verne |title = The Green Ray | page = 305 | translator = M. de Hauteville | url = https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&amp;id=3_ABAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Jules+Verne%27s+%E2%80%9CEtruscan+vase%E2%80%9D&amp;ots=WdLjWYdE7s&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;q=sun#PPA306,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the sunset progresses the shape of Etruscan vase slowly changes; the stem of the vase gets shorter until the real and the miraged Suns create a new shape – Greek letter omega [[omega|Ω]]. The inferior mirage got its name because the inverted image appears
below the erect one.&lt;ref name="An Introduction to Mirages"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/mirages/mirintro.html An Introduction to Mirages] by Andy Young&lt;/ref&gt;

Here's how Jules Verne describes an inferior mirage [[sunset]].&lt;ref name="Jules Verne page 305" /&gt;

:{{Quotation|All eyes were again turned towards the west. The sun seemed to sink with greater rapidity as it approached the sea ; it threw a long trail of dazzling light over the trembling surface of the water ; its disk soon changed from a shade of old gold, to fiery red, and, through their half-closed eyes, seemed to glitter with all the varying shades of a kaleidoscope. Faint, waving lines streaked the quivering trail of light cast on the surface of the water, like a spangled mass of glittering gems. Not the faintest sign of cloud, haze, or mist was visible along the whole of the horizon, which was as clearly defined as a black line traced on white paper. Motionless, and with intense excitement, they watched the fiery globe as it sank nearer and nearer the horizon,and, for an instant, hung suspended over the abyss. Then, through the refraction of the rays, its disk seemed to change till it looked like an Etruscan vase, with bulging sides, standing on the water.}}
On very rare occasions the mirages of astronomical objects other than the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] might be observed. An [[apparent magnitude]] of an [[astronomical object]] should be low enough (that is, bright enough) in order to see it as not only a real object, but also a miraged one.

==Mock mirage of astronomical objects==
[[Image:Sunset mirage 111505.jpg|Pancake-like shape of the setting Sun|thumb|150px]]
A mock mirage of [[astronomical object]]s is much more complex than an inferior mirage. While an inferior mirage of astronomical objects can produce only two images, a mock mirage can produce multiple miraged images. The shapes of the miraged object are changing constantly and unpredictably. In order for a mock mirage to appear, the cooler air needs to be trapped below the inversion. Several inversion layers produce multiple pancake-like shapes.&lt;ref name="Sunset Mirage"&gt;[http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/sunmir.htm Sunset Mirages] Les Cowley&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that one of the earliest mock mirages of the setting [[Sun]] was mentioned in the [[Book of Joshua]].&lt;ref name="A meteorological anomaly in Palestine 33 centuries ago: How did the sun stop?"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Camuffo  | first = D
| title = A meteorological anomaly in Palestine 33 centuries ago: How did the sun stop | journal = Theoretical and Applied Climatology | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–85 | publisher= Springer Wien | doi = 10.1007/BF00866205 | date = March 1990 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n03790172366n756/ | accessdate = 2008-04-19 |bibcode = 1990ThApC..41...81C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joshua launched a surprise attack on the [[Amorites]] following a night march, causing the [[Amorite]]s to panic and flee as far as [[Bethoron|Beth-horon]], but they did not find a safe haven there. ..."they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword." &lt;ref name="The Book of Joshua 10.11"&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0610.htm The Book of Joshua 10.11] Joshua&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Hail]]stones" are a rare event in the [[desert]]s and are a good precondition for creating a mock/superior mirage of the setting [[sun]]. Inferior mirage is the most common mirage in the [[desert]]s. When Israelites went from a hot [[desert]] to a hail-covered [[desert]] to fight the [[Amorite]]s, the inversion layers might have created a mock mirage of the setting [[sun]]. To the Israelites, the sun appeared to stand still.&lt;ref name="A meteorological anomaly in Palestine 33 centuries ago: How did the sun stop?"/&gt; A poem is quoted from the [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jasher]], which states that the [[sun]] stood still at [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]], and the [[moon]] in the valley of Ajalon, in order that Joshua could complete the battle.&lt;ref name="The Book of Joshua 10.12;10.13"&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0610.htm The Book of Joshua 10.13] Joshua&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dore joshua sun.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Joshua commands the sun to stand still in the sky]]

{{Quotation|10.12 Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel: 'Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.&lt;br&gt;10.13  And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.}}

==Novaya Zemlya effect==
{{main|Novaya Zemlya effect}}
Due to a normal [[atmospheric refraction]], sunrise occurs shortly before the Sun crosses above the horizon. Light from the Sun is bent, or refracted, as it enters earth's atmosphere. This effect causes the apparent sunrise to be earlier than the actual sunrise. Similarly, apparent sunset occurs slightly later than actual sunset.

In ordinary atmospheric conditions, the setting or rising Sun appears to be about half a degree above its geometric position. But sometimes, very unusual atmospheric circumstances can make it to be visible when it is really between two and five degrees below the horizon. This is called the [[Novaya Zemlya effect]], because it was first observed in [[Novaya Zemlya]], where the Sun was seen when, according to astronomical calculations, it should have been two degrees below the horizon.

However, it should be noted that due to changes in air pressure, relative humidity, and other quantities, the exact effects of atmospheric refraction on sunrise and sunset time cannot be predicted. Also note that this possible error increases with higher (closer to the poles) latitudes.&lt;ref name="Solar Calculator Glossary"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Solar Calculator Glossary| publisher = NOAA.gov| date =| url =   http://www.srrb.noaa.gov/highlights/sunrise/glossary.html#apparentsunrise| accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Complex mock mirage sunset.jpg|200px|thumb|right|This mock mirage sunset was photographed in San Francisco four minutes later than apparent sunset time. It cannot be considered the [[Novaya Zemlya effect]], yet it gives a good visual representation of what [[Fridtjof Nansen]] may have seen when he was observing the Novaya Zemlya effect.]]
Novaya Zemlya is a [[polar region]] in [[Russia]]. The Novaya Zemlya effect is a  [[mirage]] caused by high [[refraction]] of [[sunlight]] between atmospheric [[thermocline]]s. The Novaya Zemlya effect will give the impression that the [[sunrise|sun is rising]] earlier than it actually should or the [[sunset|sun is setting]] later than it actually should.

An astronomical observation we took in the afternoon  showed that the sun must in reality have been 2° 22' below the horizon  at noon; we cannot expect to see its disk above the ice before Tuesday at  the earliest; it depends on the refraction, which is very strong in this cold air.

It is possible to observe the Novaya Zemlya effect in any place, where the temperature variations are great enough to produce a  high [[refraction]].{{clear}}

==Green flash==
{{Main|Green flash}}
Green flash is a rare [[optical phenomenon]] that occurs during or shortly after set and during or before rise of a [[apparent magnitude|bright]] [[astronomical object]], when a [[green]] spot is visible for a short period of [[time]] above a mirage of an [[astronomical object]] or its set/rise point.
Green flashes are enhanced by [[inversion (meteorology)|atmospheric inversions]] which increase the density gradient in the atmosphere, and therefore increase refraction. In other words, to see a green flash a mirage should be present.&lt;ref name="Explaining Green Flashes"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/explain/explain.html Explaining Green Flashes] by Andy Young&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jules Verne]] described a green flash.&lt;ref name="Jules Verne page 305" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jules Verne page 32"&gt;{{cite book | author = Jules Verne | title = The Green Ray | page = 32 | translator = M. de Hauteville | url = https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&amp;id=3_ABAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Jules+Verne%27s+%E2%80%9CEtruscan+vase%E2%80%9D&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;q=green+ray#PPA33,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Quotation|...it will be ' green,' but a most wonderful green, a green which no artist could ever obtain on his palette, a green which neither the varied tints of vegetation nor the shades of the most limpid sea could ever produce the like !

[[Image:Sunset sequence07-23-06.jpg|Sunset sequence with two green flashes in the second and fourth frames|thumb|200px|right]]
Green flashes might be observed from any place with a low [[horizon]]. [[Desert]]s, [[ocean]]s and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] are probably the best places to observe mirages and therefore green flashes. It is easier not to miss a green flash during [[sunset]] than during [[sunrise]]. It is especially true regarding an inferior mirage green flash, when the timing should be just right to capture it at sunrise.&lt;ref name="A new route across Egypt's Sahara"&gt;{{Cite news| title =Egyptology News | publisher = egyptology.blogspot.com| date =|last = Twigger |first = Robert |url = http://egyptology.blogspot.com/2007/11/robert-twigger-on-travel-to-gilf-kebir.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation|I could see the sun glowing below the distant horizon. Then, for what seemed like at least a second, the green flash flooded the desert like an alien [[heliograph]]. A moment later, the skyline erupted with the instant magnificence of the sun, its sudden warmth.
}}
From the above observation it is clear that the author observed an inferior mirage green flash, when the much warmer surface of the [[desert]] with the help of the rising Sun was fighting the cool morning air, producing in the process a green flash – one of nature's great spectacles.

A green flash might be also seen with a [http://www.polarimage.fi/moon2/moonvi1b.jpg rising or setting Moon.]&lt;br&gt;
In the right conditions it is common to observe multiple green flashes during one mock mirage sunset.&lt;br&gt;Some claim they saw a green flash from [[Venus]]. This may be true, but it might be that a color of the setting or the rising [[planet]] is mistaken for a real green flash that is a by-product of a [[mirage]].&lt;ref name="Green Flash from Venus"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Green Flash from Venus| publisher = NOAA.gov| date =| url =   http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/whytheweather/1939/19391110.pdf| accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

==Green rim==
[[Image:Green rim of the setting sun.jpg|The upper rim of the Sun is green and lower rim is red in this image taken as the Sun sets behind the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]|thumb|150px]]
As an [[astronomical object]] sets or rises, the light it emits travels through the [[atmosphere]], which works as a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] separating the light into different colors. The color of the upper limb of an astronomical object could go from blue to green to violet depending on the decrease in concentration of [[Air pollution|pollutants]] as they spread throughout an increasing volume of atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Dispersive refraction "&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/13B.html Dispersive refraction] by webexhibits.org&lt;/ref&gt; The lower limb of an astronomical object is always red.&lt;br&gt;The green rim is very thin, and is difficult or impossible to see with the naked eye. In usual conditions a green rim of an astronomical object gets fainter, when an astronomical object is very low above the [[horizon]] because of atmospheric reddening,&lt;ref name="Green and red rims"&gt;[http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/explain/simulations/std/rims.html Green and red rims] by Andy Young&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes the conditions are right to see a green rim just above the horizon. The following quote describes probably the longest green rim, which sometimes could have been green flash, observation. It was seen on and off for 35 long minutes by members of the [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] party from the [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America exploration base]].

Often the green rim of the setting Sun will change to a [[green flash]] and then back again to a green rim during the same sunset. The image below might be a good illustration of what members of the Richard Evelyn Byrd party from the [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America exploration base]] might have seen.&lt;ref name="Annotated bibliography of mirages, green flashes, atmospheric refraction, etc."/&gt;&lt;ref name=" `Green Flash' blaze in sky at Little America"&gt;{{Cite book| title=San Francisco Chronicle| last= Owen| first=R| year=1929| pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}[[Image:Green rim and green flashes in SF.jpg|Green rim and [[green flash]]es of the setting Sun|200px|thumb|left]]{{Quotation|SEEN FOR HALF HOUR&lt;br&gt;There was a rush for the surface and as eyes turned southward, they saw a tiny but brilliant green spot where the last ray of the upper limb of the sun hung on the skyline. It lasted an appreciable length  of time, several seconds at least, and no sooner disappeared than it  flashed forth again. Altogether it remained on the horizon with short  interruptions for thirty-five minutes.&lt;br&gt;When it disappeared momentarily it seemed to have been shut off by a  tiny spurt, an inequality in the skyline caused by the barrier surface.&lt;br&gt; Even by moving the head up a few inches it would disappear and  reappear again and after it had finally disappeared from view it could  be recaptured by climbing up the first few steps of the antanea {{sic|[[antenna (radio)|antenna]]}} post.
}}
However, to see a green rim and green flash on and off for 35 minutes, there must have been some degree of mirage present.

A green rim is present in every sunset, but it is too thin to be seen with a naked [[human eye|eye]].The best time to observe the green rim is about 10 minutes before sunset time.&lt;ref name="Green and red rims"/&gt; However the solar disc is too bright at that time to use [[magnification]] such as [[binoculars]] or [[telescope]]s to look directly at the Sun. Of course a telescope or binoculars image can be projected on a sheet of paper for viewing. When the Sun gets closer to the horizon, the green rim gets fainter because  of atmospheric reddening.&lt;ref name="Green and red rims"/&gt;
Although a green rim is present in every sunset, and a green flash is rare because it requires a mirage to be present, but despite this it is actually more common for people to have seen a green flash rather than a green rim.

==Not a mirage==

[[Image:Digital camera artifact.jpg|The second Sun at the image is the inter-reflection of the Sun from [[Photographic lens|camera lens]], and not a mirage|250px|thumb]]
The composite image on the left is made out of five frames of different [[sunset]]s. None of the images is a mirage. Frames # 1 and # 2 could fool even a very experienced observer. They do look like a mock mirage of the setting [[Sun]], but they are not. Frames #3 and # 4 are clearly not a mirage. Frame # 5 is not a mirage and not even a [[sunspot]], it is a [[spider]] with the Sun as a background. The strange shapes of the Sun in this composite is due to [[vog]] and [[cloud]]s.{{citation needed|date = January 2017}}
Numerous [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] effects, such as [[vog]], [[clouds]], [[smoke]], [[smog]] and others could generate a mirage like appearance of an [[astronomical object]].{{citation needed|date = January 2017}}  [[Lens flare]]s and ghost images also might be responsible for a false mirage or a false [[green flash]].{{citation needed|date = January 2017}}{{Clear}}

The '''Northern Hemisphere''' is the half of [[Earth]] that is [[north]] of the [[Equator]].

&lt;!---please don't change dates here without first discussing on talk page. The changes will be reverted. Editors are aware that dates are "usual" but not invariable---&gt;
Owing to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], [[winter]] in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the [[Solstice|December solstice]] (typically December&amp;nbsp;21 UTC) to the [[March equinox]] (typically March&amp;nbsp;20 UTC), while [[summer]] lasts from the June [[solstice]] through to the [[Equinox|September equinox]] (typically September&amp;nbsp;23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the [[calendar year]] and the [[Year#Astronomical years|astronomical year]].

Its surface is 60.7% water, compared with 80.9% water in the case of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and it contains 67.3% of Earth's land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life on Earth: A - G.. 1|date=2002|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=9781576072868|page=528|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=iVEWPg8vnxgC&amp;pg=PA528&amp;dq=southern+hemisphere+contains+%25+land&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=southern%20hemisphere%20contains%20%25%20land&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
The Arctic is the region north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. Its climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow. The Arctic experiences some days in summer when the Sun never sets, and some days during the winter when it never rises. The duration of these phases varies from one day for locations right on the Arctic Circle to several months near the [[North Pole]], which is the middle of the Northern Hemisphere.

Between the Arctic Circle and the [[Tropic of Cancer]] lies the [[Northern temperate zone]]. The changes in these regions between summer and winter are generally mild, rather than extreme hot or cold. However, a temperate climate can have very unpredictable weather.

[[Tropics|Tropical]] regions (between the Tropic of Cancer and the [[Equator]]) are generally hot all year round and tend to experience a [[Wet season|rainy season]] during the summer months, and a [[dry season]] during the winter months.

In the Northern Hemisphere, objects moving across or above the surface of the Earth tend to turn to the right because of the [[coriolis effect]]. As a result, large-scale horizontal flows of air or water tend to form clockwise-turning [[Ocean gyre|gyres]]. These are best seen in ocean circulation patterns in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]] oceans.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

For the same reason, flows of air down toward the northern surface of the Earth tend to spread across the surface in a clockwise pattern. Thus, clockwise air circulation is characteristic of [[high pressure]] weather cells in the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, air rising from the northern surface of the Earth (creating a region of low pressure) tends to draw air toward it in a counter-clockwise pattern. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] and [[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]] (massive low-pressure systems) spin counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The shadow of a sundial moves clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (opposite of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]). During the day, the Sun tends to rise to its maximum at a southerly position except between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, where the sun can be seen to the north, directly overhead, or to the south at noon dependent on the time of year.

When viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the [[Moon]] appears inverted compared to a view from the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/our-solar-system/46-our-solar-system/the-moon/observing-the-moon/135-does-the-moon-look-different-in-the-northern-and-southern-hemispheres-beginner|title=Does the Moon look different in the northern and southern hemispheres?

This results in the Milky Way being sparser and dimmer in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere, making the Northern Hemisphere more suitable for deep-space observation, as it is not "blinded" by the Milky Way.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5563">'''Ocean privatization''' is the sale of the [[ocean]]s to private individuals or companies. [[Libertarianism|Libertarians]] have long proposed such [[privatization]].

''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', published in 1970, stated that "as companies drilling for off-shore oil have proved, there is no reason why a piece of land cannot be owned and used simply because it is covered by water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|url=http://mises.org/books/marketforliberty.pdf|pages=59|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|date=March 1970|chapter=Property – The Great Problem Solver}}&lt;/ref&gt; In proposing privatization, [[Walter Block]] stated that "there are vast areas of human existence where private property rights play no role at all: oceans, seas, rivers and other bodies of water. But why should we expect that there would be any better results from such 'water socialism' than we have experienced from [[socialism]] on land?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Water Privatization|author=Block, Walter|url=http://mises.org/journals/scholar/waterprivate.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Rothbard]]'s ''[[For a New Liberty]]'' likewise notes, "Anyone can capture fish in the ocean, or extract its resources, but only on the run, only as [[hunters and gatherers]]. No one can farm the ocean, no one can engage in [[aquaculture]]. In this way we are deprived of the use of the immense fish and mineral resources of the seas...Even now there is a simple but effective technique that could be used for increasing fish productivity: parts of the ocean could be fenced off electronically, and through this readily available [[electronic fencing]], fish could be segregated by size. By preventing big fish from eating smaller fish, the production of fish could be increased enormously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://mises.org/rothbard/foranewlb.pdf|title=For a New Liberty|chapter=Libertarian Applications to Current Problems|author=Rothbard, Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Ruwart]]'s ''[[Healing Our World]]'' states, "Owners would also be more likely to invest in [[artificial reef]]s to bolster the fish population. [[Whaler]]s could operate only with the permission of the owners, much as hunters must request permission to stalk deer on privately owned land. Ocean owners profit most by making sure that the valuable species in their region are not hunted to extinction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ruwart.com/Healing/rupart5.html|title=Healing Our World|chapter=A New Age or a New World Order}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much as ownership of land also, under the [[common law]], included ownership of all the airspace above him upward indefinitely unto the heavens and downward into the center of the earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mises.org/daily/2120|title=Law, Property Rights, and Air Pollution|author=Rothbard, Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; and causing polluted air to enter another person's airspace would constitute [[aggression]], causing polluted water to enter waters owned by another person would constitute aggression that would be legally treated as such, under an [[anarcho-capitalist]] system.

In 2009 George Mason University professor Peter T. Leeson has suggested that ocean privatization could help combat [[Somalian piracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/180288/want-prevent-piracy-privatize-ocean/peter-t-leeson|title=Want to Prevent Piracy?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4301">{{About|optical depth in astrophysics|optical depth in general|optical depth}}

'''Optical depth''' in astrophysics refers to a specific level of transparency.  Optical depth and actual depth, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; respectively, can vary widely depending on the absorptivity of the astrophysical environment.  Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is able to show the relationship between these two quantities and can lead to a greater understanding of the structure inside a star.

Optical depth is a measure of the [[Mass attenuation coefficient|extinction coefficient]] or [[Absorbance|absorptivity]] up to a specific 'depth' of a star's makeup.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau \equiv \int_0^z \alpha  dz = \sigma N.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/OpticalDepth.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption here is that either the extinction coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or the column number density &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is known.  These can generally be calculated from other equations if a fair amount of information is known about the chemical makeup of the star. From the definition, it is also clear that large optical depths correspond to higher rate of obscuration. Optical depth can therefore be thought of as the opacity of a medium. 

The extinction coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated using the [[Radiative transfer#Solutions to the equation of radiative transfer|transfer equation]].  In most astrophysical problems, this is exceptionally difficult to solve since solving the corresponding equations requires the incident radiation as well as the radiation leaving the star. These values are usually theoretical.

In some cases the [[Beer-Lambert Law]] can be useful in finding &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=e^\frac{4 \pi \kappa}{\lambda_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[refractive index]], and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of the incident light before being absorbed or scattered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.files.chem.vt.edu/chem-ed/spec/beerslaw.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that the Beer-Lambert Law is only appropriate when the absorption occurs at a specific wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt;. For a gray atmosphere, for instance, it is most appropriate to use the Eddington Approximation.

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is simply a constant that depends on the physical distance from the outside of a star.  To find &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; at a particular depth &lt;math&gt;z'&lt;/math&gt;, the above equation may be used with &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and integration from &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;z=z'&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Eddington approximation and the depth of the photosphere ==
Since it is difficult to define where the [[photosphere]] of a star ends and the [[chromosphere]] begins, astrophysicists usually rely on the [[Radiative transfer#The Eddington approximation|Eddington Approximation]] to derive the formal definition of &lt;math&gt;\tau=2/3&lt;/math&gt;

Devised by [[Sir Arthur Eddington]] the approximation takes into account the fact that &lt;math&gt;H^-&lt;/math&gt; produces a "gray" absorption in the atmosphere of a star, that is, it is independent of any specific wavelength and absorbs along the entire electromagnetic spectrum.  In that case,
:&lt;math&gt;T^4 = \frac{3}{4}T_e^4\left(\tau + \frac{2}{3}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[effective temperature]] at that depth and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the optical depth.

This illustrates not only that the observable temperature and actual temperature at a certain physical depth of a star vary, but that the optical depth plays a crucial role in understanding the stellar structure.  It also serves to demonstrate that the depth of the photosphere of a star is highly dependent upon the absorptivity of its environment.  The photosphere extends down to a point where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is about 2/3, which corresponds to a state where a photon would experience, in general, less than 1 scattering before leaving the star.

The above equation can be rewritten in terms of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:
:&lt;math&gt;T^4 = \frac{3}{4}T_e^4\left(\int_0^z (\alpha)  dz  + \frac{2}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is useful, for example, when &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is not known but &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is.

[[File:Rupununi Savannah.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Rupununi Savannah, in the [[Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo]] region of [[Guyana]].]]

The '''Rupununi Savannah''' is a [[savanna]] plain in [[Guyana]], in the [[Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo]] region. It is an [[ecoregion]] of the [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[Biome]].&lt;ref name = "eco"&gt;[http://www.gol.net.gy/rweavers/tourism.html The Rupununi Savannahs: An Eco-Tourist's Dream]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Rupununi Savannah is located between the [[Rupununi River]] and the border with [[Brazil]] and [[Venezuela]]. The Rupununi forms the southwestern wilderness territory of Guyana, a Caribbean country situated on the Northeastern [[littoral]] of South America. The savannah is dissected by the [[Kanuku Mountains]]. The Rupununi Savannah encompasses 5000 square miles of virtually untouched grasslands, swamplands, rain-forested mountains. The region usually floods in the [[wet season]] (May to August). Early European explorers believed that the Rupununi [[floodplain]]s were the legendary [[Lake Parime]].&lt;ref name = "Waterton"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31811/31811-h/31811-h.htm Charles Waterton, ''Wanderings in South America,'' Cassell &amp; Co, Ltd: London, Paris &amp; Melbourne. 1891.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Humboldt"&gt;[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/humboldt/alexander/travels/chapter25.html Humboldt, Alexander von, ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America During the Years 1799-1804,'' (chapter 25). Henry G. Bohn, London, 1853.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rupununi.org/the-book/ Graham Watkins, Pete Oxford, and Reneé Bish. ''Rupununi: Rediscovering a Lost World,'' Earth in Focus Editions; November 1, 2010] {{ISBN|0984168648}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The area is inhabited by some 15,000 [[Amerindian]]s.

==Biodiversity==
The savannah is divided north from south, by the [[Kanuku Mountains]], Guyana’s most biologically diverse region. According to [[Conservation International]], the "area supports a large percentage of Guyana’s [[biodiversity]]", including 250 species of bird life, 18 of which are native "only to the lowland forests of the Guianas." The savannah is teeming with wildlife, including a large variety of bird species. The savannah is also home to the [[jaguar]] as well as the [[Harpy Eagle]], the world’s most powerful [[bird of prey]], an extremely rare and [[endangered species]] which once ranged the forests of South America and is found in the Rupununi/Kanuku mountain range.&lt;ref name = "eco"/&gt;

==Population==
The Rupununi is the home of the [[Wapishana]], [[Macushi]], [[Wai-wai people|Wai-Wai]] and [[Patamona people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rupununi.org/people/ Rupununi people]&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey recorded a population of 14,689 Amerindians.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The Wapishana live mainly in the south savannah, the Macushi in the north. Some 200 Wai-Wai live in near isolation in the remote southeastern region bordering Brazil virtually untouched by modern life.

The major occupations or industries in the Rupununi Savannah are [[cattle ranching]] for beef, [[Manilkara bidentata|Balatá]] bleeding to extract [[latex]]; farming groundnuts, maize (corn), [[cassava]], and vegetables; fishing and hunting; and craft work such as the manufacture of [[hammocks]], leather articles, [[Wicker|Nibbi]] furniture and beadwork).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

There are Amerindian villages dotted throughout the Rupununi Savannah, as well as many ranches worked by ''[[vaqueros]]'' (cowboys), some of whom are descendants of 19th century [[Scotland|Scottish]] settlers. The main town is [[Lethem, Guyana|Lethem]], located beside the [[Takutu River]], on the border with Brazil. Owing to the savanna's remoteness from the rest of the country most trade is conducted with Brazil and most people speak  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

In 1969 some ranchers started what has been referred to as the [[Rupununi Uprising]]. The revolt was quelled within a few days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyana.org/features/trail_diplomacy.html Odeen Ishmael. ''The Trail of Diplomacy: A Documentary History of the Guyana-Venezuela Border Issue,'' Xlibris Corporation, 2013.] {{ISBN|1493126547}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

==Ecotourism==
The Rupununi region caters towards [[ecotourism|ecotourists]]. It is designated a "protected area" by the government of Guyana, housing some 80% of the mammals and 60% of the bird life found in Guyana’s tropical forests and savannahs. Several Lodges welcome guests, for example [[Dadanawa Ranch]] or Karanabo ranch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rupununi.org/tourism/ Guyana’s Rupununi Land of Nature, Authentic Culture, and Adventure]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rupununi is accessible by small aircraft and helicopter flights regularly available from Guyana’s capital [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] on the Atlantic coast. In the dry season it is accessible by an unpaved "all-weather" road using trucks or 4x4 vehicles. It takes about 48 hours of tough driving. Heavy flooding makes this drive unpredictable and dangerous in the rainy season during the months of April to June.&lt;ref name = "eco"/&gt;

The '''Tauhara Power Station''' is a [[geothermal power]] station north of [[Taupo]] in [[New Zealand]]. Stage 2 of the project is being developed by [[Contact Energy]] and Tauhara Moana Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10757239| title=Maori trust signs geothermal drilling deal with Contact Energy| date=7 October 2011| first=Whare| last=Akuhata| publisher=New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tauhara Stage 1==
Stage 1 of the Tauhara project is operational as the [[Te Huka Power Station]].  This is a 24MW binary plant supplied with geothermal steam from the Tauhara field.&lt;ref name="Energy2014" /&gt;

==Tauhara Stage 2==
The application for [[resource consent]]s for the 250MW power station was submitted in February 2010.  The Minister for the Environment determined that this project was one of national significance, and referred it to an independent Board of Inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/first-epa-request-referred-board-inquiry| title=First EPA request referred to board of inquiry| date=23 March 2010| first=Nick| last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resource consents were granted in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.govt.nz/Resource-management/completed/th/Pages/report-and-decision.aspx| title=Report and decision| publisher=[[Environmental Protection Authority (New Zealand)|Environmental Protection Authority]]| date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first infrastructure project to be processed under the new Board of Inquiry process administered by the [[Environmental Protection Authority (New Zealand)|Environmental Protection Authority]].

The project is expected to cost around $1 billion.

A '''U.S. National Marine Sanctuary''' is a federally designated area within [[United States]] waters that protects areas of the marine environment with special conservation, [[recreation]]al, [[ecology|ecological]], historical, cultural, [[archeology|archeological]], scientific, educational, or aesthetic qualities.  The National Marine Sanctuary System consists of 14 [[marine protected area]]s that encompass more than {{convert|783000|sqmi|km2}}. Individual areas range from less than {{convert|1|to|583,000|sqmi|km2|0}}.&lt;ref name="sanctuaries.noaa.gov"&gt;

The National Marine Sanctuaries Program (NMSP), a division of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) administers the 13 national marine sanctuaries.  The program began after the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]] off the coast of [[California]] brought the plight of marine [[ecosystem]]s to national attention. The [[United States Congress]] responded in 1972 with the [[Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act]] which allowed for the creation of marine sanctuaries.  The resources protected by U.S. national marine sanctuaries range from [[coral reef]] ecosystems in [[American Samoa]], [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Texas]], to shipwrecks in the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Casserley2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=Casserley, TR |title=Torrid Seas to Icebound Lakes: Shipwreck Investigations within NOAA's National Marine Sanctuaries |journal=In: Pollock NW, ed.

==Scope of protection==

Designation as a [[National Marine Sanctuary]] does not automatically prohibit fishing and other activities.  Recreational and commercial fishing is allowed in some sanctuaries.  It is possible to restrict consumptive or destructive activities through the initial designation process  and NMSP actions.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} There are restrictions in some sanctuaries that are enforced by other governing agencies. For example, current regulations restricting fishing in [[Stellwagen Bank]] were not issued by the NMSP, but rather by [[NOAA Fisheries]] and the New England Fishery Management Council, which have jurisdiction in federal waters off the New England coast generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stellwagen.noaa.gov/about/faq.html#fishing|title=About: FAQ: Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary|accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The private non-profit [[Marine Conservation Institute]] has compiled fact sheets for each sanctuary listing activities which are directly regulated by the NMSP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine-conservation.org/what-we-do/program-areas/mpas/national-marine-sanctuaries/ National Marine Sanctuaries » Marine Conservation Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
